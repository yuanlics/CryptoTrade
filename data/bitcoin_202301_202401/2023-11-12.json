        "content": "Cboe Digital to become first U.S. regulated crypto native exchange and clearinghouse to enable both spot and leveraged derivatives trading on a single platform\n\nnative exchange and clearinghouse to enable both spot and leveraged derivatives trading on a single platform 11 leading firms across crypto and traditional finance committed to supporting launch on Day 1\n\nCHICAGO, Nov. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Cboe Digital today announced plans to launch trading and clearing in margin futures on Bitcoin and Ether, beginning January 11, 2024. With this launch, Cboe Digital will become the first U.S. regulated crypto native combined exchange and clearinghouse to enable both spot and leveraged derivatives trading on a single platform. Committed to bringing trust, transparency and responsible innovation to the crypto spot and derivatives markets, Cboe Digital presents an intermediary-inclusive model, ensures separation of duties to avoid conflicts of interest, and uses an integrated exchange-clearinghouse model that will allow it to potentially bring more unique and groundbreaking offerings in 2024.\n\nCboe Digital will initially offer financially settled margined contracts on Bitcoin and Ether and plans to expand its product suite to include physically delivered products at a later date, subject to regulatory approvals. The margin model is designed to allow customers to trade futures without posting the full collateral up front, thereby providing greater capital efficiency compared to trading futures on a non-margined basis. Significantly, Cboe Digital's unified spot and derivatives trading platform will also help enable customers to easily access both markets, creating opportunities for additional capital and operational efficiencies.\n\nCboe Digital's planned launch of margin futures will be supported by leading firms across the cryptocurrency and traditional financial marketplace, including B2C2, BlockFills, CQG, Cumberland DRW, Jump Trading Group, Marex, StoneX Financial, Talos, tastytrade, Trading Technologies and Wedbush.\n\n\"Our upcoming launch of margin futures represents a significant milestone for Cboe Digital, and we are grateful to have the support of such a remarkable group of industry partners who share our commitment to building trusted and transparent crypto markets,\" said John Palmer, President of Cboe Digital. \"Futures have long served as valuable hedging instruments in the traditional financial markets, and we couldn't be more excited to extend access to this tool further into the digital assets markets and offer margined trading for our customers. We believe derivatives will foster additional liquidity and hedging opportunities in crypto and represent the next critical step in this market's continued growth.\"\n\n\"As a leading liquidity provider delivering deep and reliable pricing across market conditions, B2C2 supports efforts to enhance institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies,\" said Nicola White, CEO of B2C2. \"We are pleased to be working with high-quality exchanges such as Cboe Digital whose focus is on transparent markets and superior risk management resources.\"\n\n\"Cboe Digital's offer in providing secure access to regulated futures markets is key to maturing this nascent asset class and enabling broader institutional participation,\" said Chris Zuehlke, Global Head of Cumberland DRW. \"We are pleased to support and provide liquidity to Cboe's markets.\"\n\n\"We've been trading on Cboe markets for many years, and we welcome their new initiative. There is customer demand for these products, and Marex is keen to support its customers from the outset,\" said Thomas Texier, Head of Clearing at Marex. \"Cboe Digital's margin futures launch will help bring competitive technology and innovative solutions to regulated markets.\"\n\n\"Cboe Digital has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency innovation since its inception and is a trusted platform in the growing space,\" said Vincent Angelico, Head of Clearing and Execution Services at StoneX Financial. \"We look forward to working with Cboe Digital and building a secure and transparent marketplace for crypto spot and derivatives trading.\"\n\n\"At tastytrade, we believe regulated derivatives play a valuable role for investors navigating any market, and who better to bring leveraged crypto derivatives to the forefront than Cboe Digital,\" said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America and President of tastytrade. \"With their innovative products, well-governed markets and secure access, we look forward to working with Cboe Digital.\"\n\n\"Cboe Digital has been instrumental in helping facilitate the creation of a transparent well-regulated crypto spot and derivatives market,\" said Bob Fitzsimmons at Wedbush Securities. \"We congratulate Cboe Digital on this exciting target and look forward to continued collaboration in this market.\"\n\nCboe Digital's planned launch of margin Bitcoin and Ether futures will complement its existing offering of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin and USDC trading on its spot crypto market. Contract margin requirements for the new futures will be published on Cboe Digital's website daily, along with standardized portfolio analysis of risk (SPAN\u00ae) compatible risk parameter files that can be used to replicate margin calculations.\n\nAbout Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nCboe Global Markets (Cboe: CBOE), a leading provider of market infrastructure and tradable products, delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions to market participants around the world.

        "title": "What Is Paul Krugman's Problem With Bitcoin? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Paul Krugman is a Distinguished Professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center and a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He is published regularly in the New York Times and is known for his skepticism of cryptocurrency and blockchain.\n\nKey Takeaways Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman has never been a fan of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.\n\nKrugman argues that these digital tokens serve no economic purpose and that their valuation is tenuous.\n\nWhether or not Bitcoin is genuinely a bubble remains to be seen, but many prominent thinkers strongly disagree with Krugman's position.\n\nUnderstanding Paul Krugman's Position\n\nPaul Krugman bases his opinions and stance on cryptocurrencies on his years of economics study, teaching, and expertise.\n\nIn a 2018 New York Times op-ed titled \"Transaction Costs and Tethers: Why I'm a Crypto Skeptic,\" crypto-skeptic Paul Krugman wrote:\n\n\u201cWhat problem does this technology solve? What does it do that other, much cheaper and easier-to-use technologies can\u2019t do just as well or better? I still haven\u2019t heard a clear answer.\"\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist's sentiments haven't changed much since the 2018 op-ed he filed from vacation in Europe, a result of his pondering of bitcoin and blockchain while \"hiking and biking in various parts of Europe.\"\n\n\n\nThat year, he stated that it set the monetary system back by 300 years when gold was the primary form of exchange and that there didn't seem to be a clear upside to this regression. Krugman still made the claim three years later:\n\n\"Because Bitcoin and its relatives haven\u2019t managed to achieve any meaningful economic role, what happens to their value is basically irrelevant to those of us not playing the crypto game.\"\n\nMultiple Strikes Against Bitcoin?\n\nThroughout his published op-eds, Krugman describes why more caution and regulation are needed for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\nCosts\n\nThe transaction costs for gold are high because it's heavy and bulky and is considerably expensive to store. Fiat currencies incur lower, but still significant, transaction costs because they are paper-based. Subsequent shifts towards checks and credit and debit cards have further decreased the need and costs for paper-based currency.\n\nIn turn, this has led to them being widely adopted by countries around the world. That they are widely accepted provides further impetus for their use. In contrast, bitcoin has significant transaction costs in the form of its energy requirements. It is also not widely accepted, and that further increases the costs required to conduct practical commerce using Bitcoin.\n\nLack of Tethering\n\nBitcoin has a lack of tethering capability. In practical terms, this means there are no real backstops available to it as they are to paper money and gold. Government backing provides credibility to paper money. Gold has practical applications in jewelry and industry, which provide \"a weak but real tether to the real economy.\"\n\nBecause of its digital and stateless nature, bitcoin has neither a physical application nor a central authority to vouch for its status as a medium of exchange. \"If speculators were to have a collective moment of doubt, suddenly fearing that Bitcoins were worthless, well, Bitcoins would become worthless,\" writes Krugman.\n\nIn a June 2021 op-ed, along with the opinion that stablecoins like TerraUSD start as a way to keep third parties out of transactions but eventually end up needing them to operate as a stablecoin, Krugman furthered his stance on a lack of tethering, pointing to TerraUSD's loss of its peg to the dollar and eventual collapse. As it turns out, the only way to truly be stable, pegged, or tethered is to hold an amount of currency (or an equal value of property) equal to the total intended value of the cryptocurrency (such as $1,000 for 1,000 tokens).\n\nIt's a Bubble\n\nTo be sure, Krugman has maintained a steady position against Bitcoin. In 2018, Krugman said that the cryptocurrency was an obvious bubble. He said its prices were rising because \"Early investors in a bubble make a lot of money as new investors are drawn in, and those profits pull in even more people. The process can go on for years before something\u2014a reality check, or simply exhaustion of the pool of potential marks\u2014brings the party to a sudden, painful end.\"\n\nNo Hard Evidence to Oppose His Opinions\n\nHe has argued in a similar manner in more recent op-eds, reiterating his belief that Bitcoin is a scam, bubble, and designed by people who don't understand the fundamentals of a fiat currency system. Many of his opponents respond with, in his words, \"technobabble,\" which doesn't offer any oppositional evidence. Some of his main points over the years are:\n\nPonzi and pyramid schemes excel where there is a strong narrative, and Krugman believes that the \"narrative\" is where crypto \"really excels.\"\n\nBitcoin has turned out not to be inflation-proof.\n\nMost investors buy cryptocurrencies through exchanges, which take their money and hold their keys for them, creating the need for trust in a financial environment designed to dispel the need for trust.\n\nCryptocurrency has only gained its status through association with institutions and individuals playing on their trustworthiness.\n\nWhat Is Paul Krugman's Theory? Paul Krugman won his Nobel Prize for disputing that countries produce different goods due to their different circumstances. He claimed that economies of scale meant similar countries producing similar products dominate world trade.\n\nWhere Did Paul Krugman Go to College? Paul Krugman earned his Ph.D. in economics from MIT and his bachelors from Yale.\n\nWhat Awards Has Paul Krugman Won? Most notably, he has won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and the John Bates Clark Medal. Other awards include the Adam Smith Award, the Howland Memorial Prize, and the H.C. Recktenwald Prize in Economics from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPaul Krugman is a well-respected and award-winning economist with a strong stance against Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption and use. He makes many excellent and concerning points in his op-eds that are contested by cryptocurrency fans and investors and lauded by other skeptics.\n\n\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin investors are eagerly waiting for regulators to approve the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which could be significant for cryptocurrency investors, experts say.\n\nLast week, the price of bitcoin notched an 18-month high, climbing to $37,970, after BlackRock took first steps toward an ether ETF. The price of bitcoin has more than doubled since the start of 2023, but it's still well below its November 2021 peak.\n\nAt least nine asset management firms \u2014 including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Valkyrie and others \u2014 are waiting for Securities and Exchange Commission approval to issue a spot bitcoin ETF. Experts say the first approval could come early in 2024.\n\nMore from ETF Strategist:\n\n3 big reasons exchange-traded funds went 'mainstream'\n\nHere's how to use ETFs in 3 popular investing strategies\n\nETFs among top 3 products more popular since 2020\n\n\"For ETF investors, this would be the best product on the market,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. \"All the other options right now have flaws to varying degrees.\"\n\nCurrently, U.S. investors can buy bitcoin futures ETFs, which own bitcoin futures contracts, or agreements to buy or sell the asset later for an agreed-upon price. The long-awaited bitcoin spot ETF would invest in the digital asset directly."

        "content": "The gap between the price of the $23 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and its net asset value narrowed to 11% last week as hopes for a spot bitcoin ETF reached a fever pitch. But GBTC isn\u2019t the only quasi-closed-end cryptocurrency fund seeing its discount drop.\n\nThe competing Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC), which has $100 million in assets under management, is trading only 7% below its net asset value, the smallest discount in over a year.\n\nThe difference between the price of the $6.1 billion Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and its NAV is now 16%, down from 60% in December, while the gap between the price of the $227 million Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) and its NAV is now 44%, down from 77% in December.\n\nMeanwhile, the $106 million Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTCN) and the $70 million Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCHG) are trading with premiums of 5% and 2%, respectively, after sporting discounts of around 60% at the start of the year.\n\nThe fast-disappearing discounts on these trusts is a reflection of investors\u2019 expectations that the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF is imminent.\n\nA successful ETF conversion would open GBTC up to redemptions, instantly bringing its market price in-line with its net asset value.\n\nWhat Comes After Bitcoin?\n\nBut a potential greenlight for spot bitcoin ETFs would have a direct impact only on GBTC. The ability to arbitrage away the discounts on the other trusts would still be lacking.\n\nOf course, investors probably believe that a spot bitcoin ETF would be followed by spot ETFs tied to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nYou can certainly make the case that a spot ether ETF won\u2019t be far behind a spot bitcoin ETF. Ethereum futures trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission recently okayed ETFs tied to those futures contracts. A spot ether ETF isn\u2019t much of a stretch.\n\nWhat is more of a stretch are ETFs tied to other cryptocurrencies, such as litecoin and bitcoin cash. There are no futures contracts on the CME tied to those cryptocurrencies, and so the SEC can\u2014and likely will\u2014make the case that these should be treated differently than bitcoin and ether.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a litecoin, bitcoin cash or dogecoin ETF launching anytime soon.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes the price action in LTCN and BCHG ironic. They\u2019ve been acting even better than GBTC and ETHE, even though a conversion of those trusts into ETFs is still far-fetched.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

They include a prolonged bear market, negative investor sentiment around scams and ecosystem collapses and unfriendly regulations that prevent investors from transacting Bitcoin freely.\n\nHowever, 2023 saw an overall trend reversal as crypto entrepreneurs took charge of the situation and helped regain investor confidence. As a result of rising market prices coupled with growing interest among the masses, the mining community witnessed a year-long increase in revenue.\n\nMarathon\u2019s Q3 Earnings Release is here:\n\n- Revenue of $97.8M, due to 467% increase in #Bitcoin production and higher BTC prices.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA improves to $43.7M.\n\n- 8% increase in hash rate; expanding with hydro-powered ventures in Paraguay.\n\n- Long-term debt reduced by 56%,\u2026 \u2014 Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) (@MarathonDH) November 8, 2023\n\nBitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings reported a revenue surge of 670% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2023 amid a nearly five-fold increase in Bitcoin production.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners double down on efficiency and renewable energy at the World Digital Mining Summit\n\nAlongside Bitcoin mining companies and individual miners, numerous countries actively participate in securing the Bitcoin network via mining.\n\nRecently, Cointelegraph reported that the landlocked Asian country of Bhutan has been actively mining Bitcoin with hydropower since the BTC price was $5,000 in April 2019.\n\nThe kingdom has reportedly explored partnerships to expand its mining operations further. Notably, it is negotiating with Nasdaq-listed mining company Bitdeer to secure 100 megawatts of power for a Bitcoin mining data center in Bhutan. This partnership would increase Bitdeer\u2019s mining capacity by about 12%.\n\nMagazine: Exclusive: 2 years after John McAfee\u2019s death, widow Janice is broke and needs answers"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) will \u201cmost likely\u201d see a serious price drawdown before a key date for institutional investors dawns, said gold bug Peter Schiff.\n\nIn recent X activity, the longtime Bitcoin skeptic sounded the alarm over recent BTC price gains.\n\nSchiff bets on a BTC price \u201ccrash\u201d before ETF launches\n\nBitcoin is a favorite topic of criticism for Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at asset management firm Euro Pacific Asset Management.\n\nThroughout the years, he has repeatedly insisted that, unlike gold, Bitcoin\u2019s value is destined to return to zero and that no one in fact wishes to hold it except in order to sell higher later on.\n\nNow, with BTC/USD circling 18-month highs, he has turned his attention to what others say will be a watershed moment for cryptocurrency \u2014 the launch of the United States\u2019 first Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAn approval is thought to be due in early 2024, while rumors that a green light could come in November are thought to have fueled last week\u2019s ascent past $37,000.\n\nWhile some believe that the announcement will be a \u201csell the news\u201d event, where investors reduce exposure once certainty over the ETF hits, for Schiff, a BTC price comedown may not even wait for that.\n\nIn an X survey on Nov. 9, he offered two scenarios for a Bitcoin \u201ccrash\u201d \u2014 before and after the ETF launch. Alternatively, respondents could choose \u201cBuy and HODL till the moon,\u201d which ultimately became the most popular choice with 68% of the nearly 25,000 votes.\n\nDespite this, however, Schiff stood his ground.\n\n\u201cBased on the results my guess is that Bitcoin crashes before the ETF launch,\u201d he responded.\n\n\u201cThat why the people who bought the rumor won\u2019t actually profit if they wait for the fact to sell.\u201d\n\nAllianceBernstein: Bitcoin ETF \u201cgetting slowly priced in\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the mood in the institutional sphere is lightening as the ETF debate looks increasingly set to end in Bitcoin\u2019s favor.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin \u2018Terminal Price\u2019 hints next BTC all-time high is at least $110K\n\nAmong the latest optimistic BTC price forecasts is that of AllianceBernstein, which last week predicted a peak of $150,000 next cycle.\n\n\u201cWe believe early flows could be slower and the build up could be more gradual, and post-halving is when ETF flows momentum could build, leading to a cycle peak in 2025 and not 2024,\u201d analysts wrote in a note quoted by MarketWatch and others.\n\n\u201cThe current BTC break-out is just simply ETF approval news getting slowly priced in and then the market monitors the initial outflows and likely gets disappointed in the short run.\u201d\n\nAn accompanying chart showed BTC\u2019s past and future price behavior delineated by halving cycles.\n\nBTC/USD cycle phases (screenshot).

        "title": "Why an ETF matters - Coinbase",
        "content": "Introduction Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have the potential to widen crypto access to a new class of investors, including registered investment advisors (RIAs), retirement funds and other institutions that have historically been precluded from this asset class. However, we do not think ETFs alone will drive the narrative that defines bitcoin adoption in the long run. ETFs may be the vehicle, but the context matters. Compared to other safe haven assets like gold, for example, bitcoin\u2019s network driven utility and inelastic supply distinguish the token from other assets. These attributes are why bitcoin can help diversify portfolios from a systematic risk perspective. Still, the impact of one or more spot bitcoin ETF approvals are significant, as it will open up a massive opportunity for the wealth management community, which handles over a third of all wealth in the US. These are not market participants that would otherwise buy and custody bitcoin independently, but instead rely on ETFs to build their unique investment strategies. Moreover, we think ETFs can potentially lead to new financial products (like lending and derivatives) that could use regulation- and compliance-friendly ETFs as their underlying. This may redefine the market structure around how crypto assets are bought, sold and/or exchanged. In the long run, this means spot bitcoin ETFs could add billions of dollars to the total crypto market cap as well as spark new potential investments for the asset class. While this will take time, we expect ETFs to lay the foundation for a more regulated environment, greater inclusion and a material growth in demand.\n\n\u2018Wen\u2019 ETF? In our view, chances have sharply improved that one or more spot bitcoin ETFs may be approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before the end of 4Q23. ( See footnote 1 .) Typically, the SEC extends its decision window to the furthest extent allowed by its regulatory framework, which in this case would be the final deadline of January 10, 2024 for the ARK-21Shares Bitcoin ETF application. However, the current timeline has been complicated by gridlock in the US House of Representatives. A potential government shutdown on November 17 would furlough over 90% of SEC staff. As a result, we think there is currently an open window for the SEC to be proactive in their decision making. In recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen a number of applicants amend their prospectuses with updated language, suggesting meaningful dialogue between these teams and the SEC. Although this is commonplace for such applications in other asset classes, this is a first for crypto, according to Bloomberg Intelligence . That seems to be driving up market expectations for one or more approvals, boosting investor appetite for bitcoin risk. The conversation around spot bitcoin ETFs in the US has been around since at least 2013, but for years, the SEC has not approved any proposals citing concerns surrounding market manipulation, surveillance-sharing arrangements and liquidity. Two things have changed this year. First, a number of high-profile financial institutions including BlackRock, Invesco and Franklin Templeton launched spot bitcoin ETF applications (see table 1). Second, a federal court sided with investment firm Grayscale after it sued the SEC for rejecting an application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\nAll that glitters is not gold Spot bitcoin ETFs have the potential to grow the crypto market by reducing the frictions that would otherwise prevent capital from flowing into the asset class. Many users compare the current situation to the gold market and the ostensibly transformative launch of the first gold ETF in the US (see our previous monthly outlook). The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) was launched in October 2004 and expanded access to the gold market for many US clients who could not easily acquire or store physical gold. Crypto pundits see this as a sympathetic analogue for bitcoin. However, the reality is that North American gold ETFs today represent less than 0.8% of the total gold supply, according to the World Gold Council . ( See footnote 2 .) We think their direct influence on the precious metals market may be somewhat overstated. For example, the GLD ETF attracted over $4.8B in net flows in its first year (inflation-adjusted to 2023 dollars), which is meaningful. But inflows didn\u2019t really take off until during the global financial crisis in 2008 through 2012, during which time GLD\u2019s AUM growth outpaced the rise in the broader gold market cap. We believe that more Americans sought umbrage in gold as a hedge against economic instability compared to residents in other regions, given that the US was the initial focal point for that crisis. By contrast, GLD\u2019s AUM has fallen from its 2020 peak during the post-pandemic era, despite the total gold market cap rising over the same period. We believe this is due to buying from global central banks (ex-US) amid concerns over rising geopolitical tensions and the weaponization of global finance. While the launch of gold ETFs in the US was a significant event that allowed broader adoption of the precious metal, we do not believe that it alone was the defining catalyst that fundamentally changed the gold market. Context matters. Whether it\u2019s gold or bitcoin, granting users access is undeniably important. However, what drives flows are the narratives that reinforce the unique characteristics of these assets in the context of changing market conditions. (See previous month outlook for more details on table 2 above.)\n\nWhat makes bitcoin different An important difference between bitcoin and gold is that bitcoin supply is much less elastic, with a fixed supply schedule. We think this point is underappreciated, as theoretically more gold can be mined to meet demand when prices rise, but the same can't necessarily be said of bitcoin. Moreover, bitcoin is a growth story. The utility of the bitcoin network expands in relation to the number of users using the network, which directly contributes to the value of the token. Comparatively, there are often no growth aspirations for buying gold. Both those factors mean that bitcoin can occupy an altogether distinct role in portfolios from a systematic risk perspective. Consider too that monetary policy in many G10 countries is currently running a greater risk of being driven by fiscal dominance , which could further increase global M2 money supply and support bitcoin performance. Thus, we think relying too heavily on direct comparisons to gold may do digital assets a disservice.\n\nDemand and supply Gold may be incongruous to bitcoin for another reason. Mainstream access to crypto today is arguably more ubiquitous than gold was prior to 2004. In fact, it\u2019s still easier to transact and hold bitcoin than physically buy and custody a commodity like gold, which is typically one of bitcoin\u2019s strengths as a store of value. But if users can already buy bitcoin directly, that begs the question of what purpose a spot bitcoin ETF ultimately serves. Although this critique is not without merit, we believe crypto accessibility is not well understood in the context of the wider investment community. As of 3Q23, US households hold over $154T of wealth (total assets minus total liabilities), of which more than a third is managed by institutional players like wealth advisors, banks and broker-dealers. Many large asset managers do not independently buy and custody bitcoin. Instead, they often rely on ETFs to build their unique investment strategies, which distinguishes spot bitcoin ETFs from alternative means of bitcoin accumulation. The implications of this may be massive for cryptocurrencies, as ETFs can potentially redefine the market structure around how these assets are bought, sold and/or exchanged. ETFs would take bitcoin further into the mainstream, putting it within reach of millions of investors in the broker dealer, registered investment advisor (RIA) and tax advantaged account structures, where such vehicles currently trade in the US. With ETFs, money managers will have a direct channel for including bitcoin in client portfolios based on formal benchmarks. That could potentially lead to new financial products (lending and derivatives, for example) using compliance-friendly ETFs as the underlying, which could then be traded among institutional counterparties. Thus, what an ETF represents for bitcoin adoption extends beyond the immediate inflows into these products, potentially reshaping the market in entirely unprecedented ways. Nevertheless, we think this will take time to unfold. For example, employers may not allow 401k retirement contributions to bitcoin on day 1 of spot bitcoin ETFs launching. In addition, we think banks and broker-dealers (who manage over 80% of the assets in the wealth management industry) represent a major opportunity for this space. This cohort of investors is less likely to own existing futures-linked bitcoin ETFs because these instruments tend to be less capital and tax efficient and potentially more expensive than what may be offered by spot bitcoin ETFs. However, strategic allocations from these sources may be restricted in the short term due to their firms\u2019 unique requirements on AUM thresholds or historical track records. Such obstacles may only be alleviated over time.\n\nForecasting is hard Trying to forecast the size of the potential net inflow into spot bitcoin ETFs can distract market players from the larger transformation taking place in the asset class. Moreover, there are a number of challenges that make this exercise difficult to do with reasonable accuracy. First, this is a new asset class, which makes it hard to gauge potential flows, because it often takes time for demand to percolate, both within the broader population and inside the wealth management community. Second, flows are contingent on the trading regime. Opportunity costs are higher and capital more scarce than they were two years ago, while the current investment environment is unlike any we've previously experienced. That gives us fewer comparables for analyzing flows with respect to previous periods. Third, flows are often path dependent, and there are currently a lot of variables that may affect initial allocations to ETFs. For example, there is already over $22.1B in AUM locked up in Grayscale\u2019s GBTC product, which cannot be redeemed for the underlying bitcoin until GBTC is converted into an ETF. When those conversations are enabled, this may affect flows in both directions depending on market positioning, competitors\u2019 expense ratios and liquidity. Thus, in our view, tracking the flows in the first week that these products launch may be far less useful than thinking about the long-term market impact. Currently, we are witnessing a massive generational transfer of wealth from baby boomers (those aged 57-75 years old) to millennials, who are much more amenable to having crypto exposure in their portfolios. By making bitcoin more easily accessible via traditional vehicles, ETFs have the opportunity to reach new segments of the population and allow adoption to grow at scale."

She admitted to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\n\nDilkinska is scheduled for sentencing on February 14, 2024, facing a potential maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for her role in the OneCoin scheme.\n\nGenesis seeks court\u2019s approval to reduce Three Arrows Capital claim from $1B to $33M\n\nBankrupt cryptocurrency lender Genesis has asked the court to approve its proposed settlement agreement with the collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).\n\nIn a recent court document, Genesis stated that 3AC should be given a claim of $33 million against Genesis. This represents 3.3% of the total claims initially made against Genesis, which amounted to $1 billion.\n\nAccording to Genesis, 3AC\u2019s claims against Genesis were the largest asserted claims in Chapter 11 cases associated with the collapse of the FTX exchange. Genesis stressed that the 3AC debtor was one of Genesis\u2019s largest borrowers from 2020 to 2022, up until the time of its collapse.\n\nSafeMoon CEO bail release goes on hold after Feds cite flight risk\n\nSafeMoon CEO Braden John Karony\u2019s bail release has been delayed by U.S. federal prosecutors, who argue that he may try to leave the country due to his alleged access to funds and connections abroad. The prosecutors expressed concerns that his release could pose a flight risk and be a potential danger to the community.\n\nThe delay comes after a New York District Judge, LaShann DeArcy Hall, decided to put a hold on the bail release order issued on Nov. 8 by a Utah Magistrate judge, who had allowed Karony to be released on a $500,000 bail. However, prosecutors contested this decision, claiming that the release order was made \u201cwithout consideration of the defendant\u2019s substantial financial means and ability to flee,\u201d and they emphasized that his release could be a \u201ccontinued danger to the community.\u201d\n\nBinance to terminate Russian ruble deposits next week\n\nBinance users in Russia need to take note: They have a little over two months, until Jan. 31, 2024, to withdraw their rubles from the platform. Binance is wrapping up its operations in Russia and plans to stop accepting deposits in Russian rubles from November 15, 2023.\n\nThis comes after Binance declared its complete exit from Russia by selling its business to a newly established crypto exchange called CommEX in September 2023. However, there\u2019s been limited information about the details of the deal, including the size of the transaction and the founders of CommEX, causing some controversy.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $37,249, Ether (ETH) at $2,078 and XRP (XRP) at $0.67. The total market cap is at $1.42 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAmong the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week were FTX Token (FTT) at 250.48%, Kaspa (KAS) at 67.23% and Cronos (CRO) at 52.20%.\n\nThe top three altcoin losers of the week are Maker (MKR) at -3.39%, Tether Gold (XAUt) at -2.60% and PAX Gold (PAXG) at -2.51%.\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s market analysis.\n\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\nSEC Chair Gensler cannot continue to abuse the powers of his agency to fulfill a political agenda of driving the new and promising digital asset industry offshore.\u201d\n\nTom Emmer, United States Republican congressman\n\nOrdinals help to express the core values of Bitcoin in a much more friendly way than Bitcoin, which is too technical or harsh for some people.\u201d\n\nLugui Tillier, commercial director for Lumx Studios\n\nBinance\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer crudely but succinctly summed up this case when he admitted that Binance was \u2018operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.\u2019 He was right.\u201d\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission\n\nAs we have witnessed with cryptocurrency, heavy-handed constraints have hindered the exploration of potentially revolutionary applications.\u201d\n\nMatthew Putman, CEO and co-founder of Nanotronics\n\nIn Web3, it\u2019s not the code that\u2019s king, but the community.

Bitcoin may next be a \u201csell\u201d at $110,000 as its new bull cycle plays out, a classic on-chain indicator suggests.\n\nAnalyzing its Terminal Price, Look Into Bitcoin creator Philip Swift described its value as a \u201csimple\u201d method of estimating long-term BTC price peaks. Terminal Price is calculated from Bitcoin\u2019s so-called \u201cTransferred Price\u201d \u2014 a value derived by dividing \u201cCoin Days Destroyed\u201d by the existing supply. Not every all-time high reaches Terminal Price, but BTC/USD did hit the trendline during its 2017 all-time and initial peak in April 2021. The current all-time high of $69,000, seen in November of that year, fell short.\n\nAs Terminal Price increases with time, $110,000 may ultimately end up a conservative target should the next all-time high occur only later in the next cycle.\n\nFUD of the Week\n\nJPEX scandal: Taiwan determines new suspects in alleged fraud \u2014 Report\n\nTaiwanese prosecutors are seeking to detain Chang Tung-ying, the chief partner at JPEX\u2019s Taiwan office, on charges of fraud related to the JPEX cryptocurrency exchange. The situation surrounding the collapsed exchange is unfolding, with the Taipei District Prosecutors Office (TDPO) reportedly identifying new suspects. According to a report from local TV channel TVBS News on November 9, the TDPO has requested the custody of Chang Tung-ying over allegations of fraud.\n\nAs part of the ongoing JPEX investigation, prosecutors in Taipei searched nine locations and summoned Chang along with three other individuals believed to be involved. Chang and JPEX lecturer Shih Yu-sheng (also known as Shi Yu) are considered suspects in the case for violating the Banking Act and the Money Laundering Control Act.\n\nCrypto exchange CoinSpot reportedly suffers $2M hot wallet hack\n\nBlockchain security firm CertiK indicates that the recent $2.4 million theft from Australian cryptocurrency exchange CoinSpot hot wallet likely occurred due to a \u201cprivate key compromise.\u201d CoinSpot appears to have experienced a hack, involving the probable compromise of a private key in one of its hot wallets.\n\nPseudonymous blockchain investigator ZachXBT highlighted two transactions on Nov. 8 that entered the wallet belonging to the alleged hacker. Subsequently, the wallet\u2019s owner transferred the funds to the Bitcoin network via THORChain and Wan Bridge. CertiK stated that the apparent exploit was likely the result of a \u201cprobable private key compromise\u201d on at least one of CoinSpot\u2019s hot wallets.\n\n\n\nAccording to Etherscan data, a transaction of 1,262 Ether, valued at $2.4 million at current prices, originated from a recognized CoinSpot wallet and entered the wallet linked to the alleged hacker.\n\nPoloniex exchange suffers $100M exploit, offers 5% bounty\n\nA crypto wallet linked to the digital exchange Poloniex has experienced suspicious outflows, evident on the blockchain explorer Etherscan. Blockchain security experts suspect a breach, resulting in attackers draining up to $100 million in crypto.\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 10, millions in crypto assets were moved from an account labeled Poloniex 4 on Etherscan. Initially estimated at $60 million, later assessments revealed the loss exceeded $100 million. CertiK, a blockchain security firm, suggests a \u201cprivate key compromise\u201d as the likely cause and notes that the funds have already been transferred to four externally owned accounts, with some converted into Ether.\n\nTop Magazine Pieces of the Week\n\nExclusive: 2 years after John McAfee\u2019s death, widow Janice is broke and needs answers\n\nTwo years after John McAfee\u2019s death, his wife, Janice, is still unable to get closure. \u201cAll I want is to see his body for myself and know that really happened.\u201d\n\n\u2018$10K JPGs\u2019 scare away gamers, Animoca\u2019s crypto game streaming plans: Web3 Gamer\n\nAnimoca buys Twitch-like platform and Web3 gaming was a major talking point at Binance Blockchain Week.\n\n6 Questions for Lugui Tillier about Bitcoin, Ordinals, and the future of crypto\n\nLugui Tillier is the commercial director for Lumx Studios, one of the top cryptocurrency firms in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 a city with a burgeoning crypto industry."

        "content": "Some great content has already been published on what\u2019s going on in bitcoin right now on VettaFi\u2019s Crypto Channel, including an insightful article from VettaVoice contributor Jennifer Nash when bitcoin broke $35,000. Here we are, just a brief time later, andbitcoin pricesare now above the $37,000, marking its highest level since May of 2022.\n\nWhat\u2019s Behind Bitcoin\u2019s Move Higher?\n\nThe factors behind its recent price move are multifaceted.\n\nEnd of Rate Hike Cycle - Hopes that the Federal Reserve finishes increasing interest rates sparks a rally in all risk-sensitive assets. Digital Gold \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s price dynamic is somewhat unique in that it also benefits from global instability along with other hard assets like gold. The conflict in the Middle East has sparked a round of \u201cdigital gold\u201d trades as a safe-haven, store-of-value play. Tight Supply \u2013 The surge in near-term demand comes at a time when bitcoin miners are selling as much as they can mine these days ahead of the so-called \u201chalving\u201d next year, and long-term HODL\u2019ers (Hold on for Dear Lifers) are unwilling to give up their tokens. Top miners sold more tokens than they produced last month, cashing in on October\u2019s price rally, creating a bitcoin liquidation-to-production ratio last month of 104%. April 2024 Halving \u2013 April\u2019s \u201chalving,\u201d as the name implies, will reduce the amount of tokens going forward, making the reward less valuable for miners after the halving but more valuable to long-term holders due to a halving of supply. Historically, most of bitcoin\u2019s gains come directly after halvings, which only occur every four years. Spot ETF Filings \u2013 Certainly another factor in bitcoin\u2019s recent rise is the increasing likelihood that the SEC will approve a spot version of a U.S. Bitcoin ETF, creating more demand at a time of limited supply. And a U.S. spot ether approval could be in the works as well.\n\nCrypto Spring in the Air?\n\nAll of this has led investors coming out of the Crypto Winter to be hopeful that Crypto \u201cSpring\u201d is in the air. For those unfamiliar with the seasonal analogies, the four phases of cryptocurrency prices correspond to the four seasons of the year. During the period preceding each halving, the price of bitcoin generally recovers from its lowest price point.\n\nMorgan Stanley put out a nice checklist to help investors identify if it is indeed a \u201cgrowing season\u201d. A 50% price increase from bitcoin\u2019s low is one of those signals that a trough level has been reached, but as mentioned above, there are a lot more dynamics in play here external to seasonality. Over the last year, bitcoin and Ethereum pricing are up considerably, up 98% and 59%, but regulatory uncertainty remains.\n\nWhen Will We Get a Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nWe are currently in an eight-day window between November 9-17, where potentially all 12 spot Bitcoin ETF filings could be approved by the SEC, according to Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, including Grayscale\u2019s conversion of its GBTC trust product. Grayscale has been in talks with the SEC over the conversion since winning its court battle with the SEC on August 29. In a new research note, James Seyffert predicts a 90% chance by January 10 of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nETF Plays for Now\n\nDigital Assets\n\nBesides buying bitcoin yourself on an exchange like Coinbase, the easiest way to get direct bitcoin exposure is through futures-based ETF products like the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which has attracted assets of more than $1.2 billion since its launch in October 2021. Since the launch of BITO, other bitcoin futures products have come to market, such as the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) and even a combo ETF strategy, the Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BTF), which holds both bitcoin and Ether futures.\n\nIn addition to bitcoin and Ethereum \u201cpure plays\u201d, there are multi-asset combinations such as the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) and the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which own both blockchain stocks and either non-US listed crypto ETFs and/or futures.\n\nBlockchain ETFs\n\nCrypto is an application on the blockchain, just like e-mail is an application on the Internet. There are many blockchain-focused ETFs as well. In addition to the actively managed BLOK, there is, in order of assets under management, the First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF (LEGR), the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators (BITQ), the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH), and the Siren NASDAQ Nex Gen Economy ETF (BLCN), to name a few.\n\nA reminder to new investors in the space: \u201cBlockchain\u201d was not allowed to be used in fund names due to SEC rules around naming conventions when many of these first ETF products launched during crypto\u2019s last \u201cspring phase\u201d in early 2018.\n\nCrypto Mining ETFs\n\nMany of the blockchain-themed ETFs also own crypto mining stocks, but a purer play on that theme is the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) based on VettaFi\u2019s CRYPTO Index or the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP). Among its top 10 holdings are crypto miners like Bitfarms (BITF), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Hive Digital Technology (HIVE).\n\nAnother top holding in both of these ETFs is MicroStrategy (MSTR), which had a big bet on bitcoin on its balance sheet that appears to have paid off with a $1.2 billion profit. But the company is not taking profits. Under controversial CEO Michael Saylor, the company is buying more.\n\nRegardless of who is right in the short term, the crypto bulls or bears, and/or what crypto season we are in, cryptocurrency as a financial asset appears here to stay for the long-term. It is another disruptive theme for investors to consider, along with technologies like blockchain that support its growing applications and use cases.\n\nFor more news, information, and strategy, visit the Disruptive Technology Channel.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is on target to end the week with gains of about 6%, indicating continued demand from the bulls. MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor said during a speech at the 2023 Australia Crypto Convention on Nov. 10 that Bitcoin\u2019s demand on a monthly basis could surge between two to 10 times by the end of 2024. Additionally, the halving will reduce the supply by half. Saylor expects both these events will cause the price \u201cto adjust up.\u201d\n\nWith almost a general consensus that Bitcoin\u2019s price will move higher in 2024, analysts are busy projecting how high the rally could reach. Using its Terminal Price on-chain indicator, Look Into Bitcoin creator Philip Swift said that Bitcoin could hit at least $110,000 in its next bull cycle.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nWhile Bitcoin continues to hog the limelight, several major altcoins have been charging higher. The broad-based cryptocurrency rally increases hopes that an altcoin season may be around the corner.\n\nIf the bullish sentiment sustains, altcoins may witness a rotation, wherein the high flyers face some profit booking, and the laggards start moving higher. Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been holding above the ascending channel pattern for the past three days, indicating that the bulls are defending the breakout level.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to thrust the price above $38,000 and start the northward march toward $40,000. While the upsloping moving averages indicate that the bulls are in control, the overbought levels on the RSI warn of a potential correction.\n\nIf the price skids back into the channel, it will suggest that the markets have rejected the higher levels. That could open the doors for a fall to the channel\u2019s support line, which is close to the 20-day exponential moving average ($34,784).\n\nThe bears will have to sink the price below the channel to indicate the start of a solid correction. The BTC/USDT pair may then decline to the $32,400 to $31,000 support zone.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls are buying the dips to the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart but have failed to resume the uptrend. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears will try to utilize this opportunity and drag the price below the 20-EMA. If they do that, the pair may fall to the 50-SMA.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns up from the current level, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the breakout level from the channel into support. That will enhance the prospects of a rally above $38,000.\n\nVeChain price analysis\n\nVeChain (VET) completed a double bottom pattern after bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $0.021 on Nov. 6.\n\nVET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls have managed to ward off attempts by the bears to pull the price back below $0.021. This suggests buyers are trying to flip the $0.021 level into support. The bulls will next attempt to propel the price above $0.023 and resume the up-move. If they do that, the VET/USDT pair could rally to the pattern target of $0.028.\n\nContrarily, if the price fails to rise above the $0.023 resistance, the likelihood of a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.020) increases. A break and close below this support will suggest that the bears are back in the game. The pair may then slump to the 50-day SMA ($0.018).\n\nThe pair has been consolidating above the breakout level of $0.021 for some time. The 20-EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.\n\nThis equilibrium will tilt in favor of the buyers if they kick the price above $0.023. That could start the next leg of the uptrend. Instead, if the price turns down and plummets below $0.021, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the higher levels. That could start a fall to $0.020.\n\nImmutable price analysis\n\nImmutable (IMX) has risen sharply in the past few days, indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback.\n\nIMX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe recovery is expected to face a formidable resistance at $1.30. If the price does not give up much ground from this level, it will enhance the prospects of a break above the overhead resistance. The IMX/USDT pair could then start a rally to $1.59.\n\nThe overbought level on the RSI warns of a possible correction or consolidation in the near term. If the price turns down sharply from the current level or $1.30, it will indicate that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That may pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($0.84).\n\nThe pair is gradually moving toward the overhead resistance of $1.30. The upsloping moving averages indicate that bulls remain in command, but the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum is weakening.\n\nSellers may mount a vigorous defense at $1.30, but if the price stays above the moving averages during the pullback, it will improve the prospects of a rally above the overhead hurdle. Alternatively, if the price turns down sharply and slides below the 50-SMA, it will indicate the start of a pullback to $0.80.\n\nRelated: FTX files billion-dollar lawsuit against ByBit over asset withdrawals\n\nThe Graph price analysis\n\nThe Graph (GRT) has corrected after a sharp up-move, but a positive sign is that the bulls have managed to keep the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.12).\n\nGRT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe GRT/USDT pair has been attempting to resume the up-move, but the bears are posing a strong challenge at $0.14. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nIf bulls overcome the obstacle at $0.16, the pair may resume its uptrend. The pair could thereafter travel to $0.21. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the up-move has ended.\n\nThe pair has found support at the 50-SMA on the 4-hour chart, but the bears are trying to halt the recovery near $0.14. If buyers pierce this resistance, the pair could retest the barrier at $0.16. This level may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.\n\nOn the downside, the 50-SMA remains the key level to keep an eye on. If this level gives way, the pair could tumble to the strong support at $0.12. This level is likely to attract buying by the bulls.\n\nAlgorand price analysis\n\nAlgorand (ALGO) is forming a rounding bottom pattern, which will complete on a break and close above the overhead resistance at $0.14.\n\nALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are at an advantage. If buyers maintain the price above $0.14, it will signal the start of a new up-move. The pattern target of the reversal setup is $0.20. If this level is scaled, the up-move may reach $0.24.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down sharply from $0.14, it will suggest that bears continue to defend the level with vigor. The ALGO/USDT pair could then slump to the 20-day EMA ($0.12).\n\nThe bulls are buying the dip to the moving averages, indicating that the sentiment is turning positive. The real test for the bulls is at $0.14. If they shove and sustain the price above this level, the pair is likely to pick up momentum.\n\nOn the downside, the moving averages remain the key level to watch out for. A break below the 20-EMA could pull the price to the 50-SMA. If this level cracks, the pair may start a correction to $0.10.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve all 12 pending spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by Nov. 17. Beginning on Nov. 9, the SEC reportedly has a \u201cwindow\u201d to approve all 12 spot Bitcoin ETF filings, including Grayscale Investments conversion of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust product.\n\nHowever, even if the SEC approves spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs by Nov. 17, it could be more than a month before the products launch. The expected delay in launch following SEC approval would be due to the two-step process of launching an ETF. For an issuer to start a Bitcoin ETF, it must get approval from the SEC\u2019s Trading and Markets division on its 19b-4 filing and its Corporate Finance division on the S-1 filing or prospectus. Of the 12 Bitcoin ETF applications, nine issuers have submitted revised prospectuses showing they have communicated with the Corporate Finance division.\n\nMeanwhile, Nasdaq filed the 19b-4 form with the securities regulator on behalf of the $9 trillion asset management firm BlackRock for a proposed ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust. The move signals BlackRock\u2019s intention to expand beyond Bitcoin with its crypto ETF aspirations. The fund has already registered the corporate entity iShares Ethereum Trust in Delaware. At least five other firms are seeking SEC approval for a spot Ether (ETH) ETF: VanEck, ARK 21Shares, Invesco, Grayscale, and Hashdex.\n\nCLARITY Act may forbid U.S. officials from engaging with Tether\u2019s parent company\n\nU.S. Representatives Zach Nunn and Abigail Spanberger have jointly introduced the Creating Legal Accountability for Rogue Innovators and Technology Act of 2023 \u2014 or the CLARITY Act of 2023. The legislation aims to prohibit federal government officials from conducting business with Chinese blockchain companies. The act would ban government employees from using the underlying networks of Chinese blockchain or cryptocurrency trading platforms. Furthermore, it would explicitly forbid U.S. government officials from engaging in transactions with iFinex, the parent company of USDT issuer Tether.\n\nContinue reading\n\nForty-seven countries pledge to start exchanging crypto tax data by 2027\n\nForty-seven national governments have issued a joint pledge to \u201cswiftly transpose\u201d the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) \u2014 a new international standard on automatic exchange of information between tax authorities \u2014 into their domestic law systems. Developed from an April 2021 mandate from the G20, the CARF framework requires reporting on the type of cryptocurrency and digital asset transaction, whether through an intermediary or a service provider. The statement\u2019s authors intend to activate exchange agreements for information exchanges to commence by 2027.\n\nContinue reading\n\nThe European Banking Authority proposes its guidelines for stablecoin issuers\n\nThe European Banking Authority (EBA) \u2014 the European Union\u2019s banking watchdog \u2014 has proposed new guidelines for stablecoin issuers to set minimum capital and liquidity requirements. Under the proposed liquidity guidelines, stablecoin issuers must offer any stablecoin backed by a currency that is fully redeemable at par to investors. The official proposal by the EBA noted that the stablecoin liquidity guidelines will act as a liquidity stress test for stablecoin issuers. The EBA believes the stress test will highlight any shortcomings and lack of liquidity for the stablecoin. This can help the authority approve only fully-backed stablecoins with enough liquidity buffer.\n\nContinue reading"

        "title": "Rebuild or retreat? Crypto faces tough choices after FTX - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nHours after Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of FTX and poster child of the crypto industry, was convicted of fraud and money laundering in New York, one of his leading venture capital backers had his say.\n\n\u201cImmediately after FTX collapsed, we extensively reviewed our due diligence process and evaluated our 18-month working relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried,\u201d said Alfred Lin, partner at Sequoia Capital. \u201cWe concluded that we had been deliberately misled and lied to.\u201d\n\nCrypto sceptics would argue that Lin was hardly the first to be taken in. Ever since bitcoin was created in 2009, the industry has variously been associated with illicit trading, such as the now defunct Silk Road marketplace, or business failures such as the 2014 collapse of Mt Gox, which at its peak handled almost three-quarters of all bitcoin in circulation.\n\nAt the height of his power, Bankman-Fried was seen as the industry\u2019s most likely route to respectability. Alongside Sequoia, FTX boasted mainstream backers such as Tiger Global, Singapore\u2019s state-owned Temasek and the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan.\n\nIn Washington, Bankman-Fried testified before congressional committees, supported more regulation and became a major political donor.\n\nIn the Bahamas, where FTX was based, Prime Minister Philip Davis championed the company as a marquee acquisition as the Caribbean country\u2019s economy sought its next economic boost.\n\nMeanwhile, FTX secured celebrity endorsements and signed sponsorship deals with Major League Baseball, the Miami Heat basketball franchise and the International Cricket Council. It filmed a Super Bowl advertisement with actor and producer Larry David.\n\nA giant screen shows Sam Bankman-Fried at a cryptocurrency conference in the Bahamas \u00a9 FT montage\n\nBut on November 2, a 12-person New York jury needed less than five hours to reach unanimous agreement that Bankman-Fried was guilty of seven charges.\n\n\u201cSam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d said US attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams. \u201cThis kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time, and we have no patience for it.\u201d\n\nAs crypto\u2019s former leading light contemplates a possible lengthy jail sentence, the industry he championed could go one of two ways: either it collectively regroups and tries \u2014 all over again \u2014 to be accepted in the world of mainstream finance, or it falls back on its longstanding image as a niche market for speculators, day traders and those who fervently believe money should remain separate from the state.\n\nFor John Reed Stark, former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s office of internet enforcement, the trial verdict is \u201ca death knell for crypto, Web 3 and blockchain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an industry that has run its course,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it all went away tomorrow, it wouldn\u2019t impact a single person on the planet other than the speculator.\u201d\n\nBut others believe the industry can recover from the debacle of the Bankman-Fried trial and become a part of mainstream finance.\n\n\u201cCrypto\u2019s public image is at an all-time low, but the industry isn\u2019t done yet,\u201d says Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto futures index platform Phuture.\n\nAn inglorious history\n\nThe ignominious conclusion of Bankman-Fried\u2019s career follows more than a decade of non-compliance with traditional financial rules, run-ins with regulators around the world, and accusations that cryptocurrencies are used to fund terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the computing power needed to \u201cmine\u201d crypto assets like bitcoin generates a carbon footprint roughly equivalent to a country the size of Ukraine.\n\nFTX\u2019s bankruptcy in 2022 capped off a crisis of confidence that resulted in popular digital assets such as bitcoin and ether losing more than half their value. Other once prominent firms like Terraform Labs and Three Arrows Capital also collapsed.\n\nIn response, lawmakers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions stepped up their oversight of the sector to unprecedented levels during 2023. US regulators have issued a blitz of enforcement cases and lawsuits against some of the biggest crypto companies still standing. They include US-listed Coinbase \u2014 which is facing an SEC lawsuit after allegedly violating securities laws \u2014 and Binance, FTX\u2019s great rival and the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by some distance.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance in March, alleging it had illegally accessed US customers and that it knew it facilitated potentially illegal activities.\n\nBinance is now the biggest crypto exchange but the company and its chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, face regulatory action from both the CFTC and SEC \u00a9 FT montage/Reuters\n\nThree months later, the SEC filed a lawsuit of its own against Binance, alleging that it had mixed customers\u2019 cash with a separate trading firm owned by its chief executive Changpeng Zhao. Both Binance and Coinbase have denied the allegations and said they will fight their respective lawsuits.\n\nIn the wake of the October 7 atrocities, Israeli law enforcement authorities closed more than 100 Binance accounts and identified about 150 crypto donation initiatives affiliated with Hamas, prompting renewed allegations about the industry\u2019s ties to financing terrorism and fresh calls for a crackdown.\n\n\u201cThis industry came to prominence after the failure of Mt Gox and the controversy of Silk Road,\u201d says Charley Cooper, a former chief of staff at the CFTC. \u201cThroughout its history, it has had multiple scandals \u2014 as a far greater proportion of their market \u2014 than any other industry has had.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of doctors are not defrauding the healthcare system, the majority of lawyers are not violating court ethics. The Wall Street guys, you can call them greedy, but they\u2019re not breaking the law,\u201d Cooper adds.\n\nYesha Yadav, professor of law at Vanderbilt Law School, describes Bankman-Fried\u2019s conviction as \u201ca monumentally important moment\u201d for the wider crypto sector. \u201cThat the jury came back so decisively really highlights how far and how deeply a key symbol of the industry had fallen . . . it\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger reputational hit.\u201d\n\nThose working in the industry are concerned that their career prospects could be damaged as a result. One professional who contacted the Financial Times says he is \u201ca little concerned with how being affiliated with crypto could be perceived for recruiting for traditional industries.\u201d\n\nHe has lost money with FTX as well as Voyager, another crypto company that collapsed last year. \u201cThe experience has made me a lot more conservative,\u201d he adds.\n\nCrypto glasnost\n\nAfter FTX filed for bankruptcy last November, influential voices in the sector called for a renewed focus on transparency.\n\nBinance\u2019s Zhao said \u201call crypto exchanges\u201d should provide proof of reserves and committed his own business to \u201cfull transparency\u201d. Days later, rival exchange OKX said it was launching its first proof of reserves \u201cto set a new standard of transparency, risk management and user protection\u201d.\n\nBut according to figures from industry data provider CCData, only about a third of crypto exchanges currently offer proof of reserves or alternatives, such as regularly audited financial statements.\n\nThose exchanges that have offered some form of financial transparency to their customers account for about 81 per cent of the market, but that is down from 86 per cent in March \u2014 and about the level it was in November 2022, when FTX went bust.\n\nAccording to Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CCData, this suggests that \u201cproof of reserves might have become less discerning to users compared to the early months after the collapse of FTX\u201d.\n\nJames Newman, co-head of perfORM Due Diligence Services Limited, says the largest and most influential of exchanges \u201chave taken steps to bring additional transparency over the assets they hold\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are many that have been slow in adopting proof of reserves,\u201d he adds, saying it is \u201clikely symptomatic of the continued dominance of retail money held on exchanges who do not speak as one voice\u201d.\n\nRetail traders \u2014 individuals trading for themselves \u2014 have been instrumental in the sector\u2019s growth. But many feel it now needs to widen its appeal. \u201cCrypto\u2019s survival relies on external support and belief from other industries,\u201d says Storry. \u201cRetail is on board, but we now need institutional backing to take the industry to the next level.\u201d\n\nThere are signs this is happening. In the summer, payments giant PayPal became the first major financial institution to launch a US dollar-pegged crypto token. The company has offered trading in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrencies since 2020, but the launch of a so-called stablecoin \u2014 a crypto asset whose price tracks that of a more recognised asset, often a conventional currency \u2014 marked a major boon for a troubled sector.\n\nEven greater hopes for institutional backing rest on BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, gaining SEC approval to launch a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund. That would allow investors to speculate on bitcoin within a regulated financial vehicle run by a recognised name.\n\nLast month, as speculation grew over BlackRock\u2019s application possibly being approved, bitcoin\u2019s price surged to $35,000, erasing all the losses it had racked up since the crypto market crisis began in May 2022.\n\nRegulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission under Gary Gensler, have been wrestling with how to regulate crypto asset trading \u00a9 FT montage/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cThere are signs of entry into this industry if you know where to look: we are talking about BlackRock launching a bitcoin exchange traded fund and PayPal launching a dollar-pegged stablecoin,\u201d says Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at financial services firm Marex.\n\nBut nothing is set in stone. The SEC, led by chair Gary Gensler, has so far resisted approving any such applications and may never give BlackRock \u2014 or any other candidate \u2014 the green light to take bitcoin to the mass market.\n\nLawmakers have also turned more circumspect. Last month, Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative French Hill urged the Department of Justice to consider criminal charges against Binance and Tether, the largest trading exchange and the largest stablecoin issuer, respectively.\n\nFollowing Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel, more than 100 lawmakers from both major political parties in the US signed a letter urging the Biden administration to outline the steps it is taking to mitigate cryptocurrencies being used as a means of financing terrorism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder to get legislation passed in the US, and there will now be a colder reception in Congress,\u201d says one crypto industry lobbyist in Washington. It remains to be seen in 2024, whether Coinbase and Binance are as willing \u2014 or even as able \u2014 to lobby regulators and politicians as FTX once was.\n\nBack to first principles\n\nThe irony of crypto\u2019s push for respectability is not lost on Reed Stark, the ex-SEC executive. \u201cAll of these crypto guys are now crying out for a bitcoin ETF, but started the bitcoin project because they were upset about the 2008 banking crisis. They were upset about the government being able to surveil their financial transactions,\u201d he points out.\n\n\u201cSo what do they do? They rally around one of the biggest financial services companies in the world because there\u2019s nothing left. It\u2019s the ultimate hypocrisy,\u201d he adds.\n\nCustomers protesting outside the offices of Mt Gox\u2019s operator in Tokyo in 2014. The failure of the exchange presaged many of crypto\u2019s current problems \u00a9 FT montage/Bloomberg\n\nBut while many in the industry have pinned their hopes on a mainstream future, another branch would prefer crypto to go back to its roots.\n\nErik Voorhees, founder of crypto platform ShapeShift and an unabashed libertarian, last month issued a rallying cry to those still faithful to the original crypto cause.\n\n\u201cWhy do we accept this world in which we are free to transact only on the conditional approval of strangers?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis of course is not freedom. It is subservience, it is serfdom, and that the chains bear lightly down in most cases should not lull us into forgetting that the chains exist.\u201d\n\nInstead of walking head first into an increasingly hostile crowd of regulators and lawmakers, Voorhees and others like him are pushing for the industry to go back to first principles: permissionless finance that stands as an explicit rejection of the establishment, government oversight and unelected regulators.\n\n\u201cWhat prevents the man of tomorrow from even greater servitude? We do . . . we are building the economic defence of modern society against plunder and restriction by the state, we are saying no to the perpetual encroachment of permissioned existence,\u201d Voorhees added.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, author, investor and former chief technology officer at Coinbase, launched the Network State conference last month in Amsterdam in a bid to \u201cbuild the parallel establishment\u201d.\n\nSpeakers including Vitalik Buterin and Anatoly Yakovenko \u2014 the minds behind the popular ethereum and solana crypto blockchains, respectively \u2014 and the Winklevoss twins \u2014 who founded the Gemini crypto exchange \u2014 all attended.\n\n\u201cThis is a meeting of all the people building the parallel establishment. That\u2019s more than parallel money. It\u2019s parallel media, parallel education, parallel science, parallel construction, even parallel cities,\u201d Srinivasan said.\n\nAfter the scandalous demise of crypto\u2019s former poster boy, the decision to retreat from a losing battle with lawmakers and regulators may be tempting, but it is a decision that risks undermining a market that is already thinly traded.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan, former chief technology officer at Coinbase, and other crypto pioneers are pushing against government regulation \u00a9 FT montage/Bloomberg\n\nAt the start of 2023, it would have required the purchase of more than 1,400 bitcoins \u2014 about $23mn at the time \u2014 to move the price of the token by more than one per cent, according to numbers shared by data provider CCData.\n\nBut by the end of April, it would have taken only 462 bitcoins \u2014 then worth about $13mn \u2014 to achieve the same market movement. This was the lowest point of market depth for bitcoin and tether, the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, since May 2022 when the sector plunged into chaos.\n\nToday\u2019s numbers have improved, but still do not portray a widely traded market with retail momentum and fresh money coming in; it would now take 752 bitcoins, worth about $26mn, to move the price of the coin.\n\n\u201cBankman-Fried\u2019s guilty verdict has been priced in for a long time, in my view,\u201d says Solot, of Marex.\n\n\u201cBut hypothetically, if this proved to be the major fork in the road where crypto adoption slowed down or even failed, the risk . . . is that you would only have internal money sloshing around in the market, and it basically atrophies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere would be no new money, there would be no growth.\u201d\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nWhere cryptocurrencies resemble Ponzi schemes / From Jean Jacques Chenier, Paris, France"

        "title": "How to Buy Bitcoin in India? - Moneycontrol",
        "content": "Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the first-ever cryptocurrency, and its performance often reflects the crypto market at large. For example, if you had invested \u20b92000 in Bitcoin on January 1st, 2023, you would have \u20b94120 worth of Bitcoin by the end of October 2023. That is a growth of 106%!\n\nAs Bitcoin approaches its next halving in 2024, its prices are steadily increasing, making now the best time to invest in Bitcoin. If you\u2019re wondering how to invest in Bitcoin, you\u2019re at the right place. This article will answer all your questions about how to buy Bitcoin easily and efficiently.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin in India\n\nBitcoin is a crypto asset that grew tremendously in adoption and value over time. Here are steps to ensure you are making a legitimate investment:\n\nStep 1: Choose a crypto investment app/exchange\n\nTo start investing in Bitcoin, you'll need to pick a suitable app or exchange. There are many cryptocurrency apps out there, so you will need to research first to find one that is right for you. There are several factors to consider when choosing an app or exchange.\n\nFirst, ensure the app values security by having two-factor authentication, encryption, and secure storage.\n\nCheck if the app offers a variety of cryptocurrencies beyond the popular ones for different investment options.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nLook for a user-friendly interface that's easy to use.\n\nBe mindful of the platform's fees, as they can affect your profits.\n\nLastly, choose a platform with good customer support and a good reputation in the crypto market for help when needed and reliability.\n\nStep 2: Sign up on the platform and complete KYC\n\nNow that you\u2019ve picked a platform for buying Bitcoin, you will need to install and sign up on the app. This process usually includes filling out your name, email ID, phone number, Aadhar details, etc, and submitting it to the platform.\n\nIn India, financial platforms must complete the KYC verification of their customers to stay compliant with Indian regulatory laws. You can use your Aadhar and PAN card details to submit a request for KYC completion. This will help verify your identity.\n\nStep 3: Add funds and place an order to buy Bitcoin\n\nNext, you need to add funds to the platform before purchasing Bitcoin. The platform should ideally support various payment methods, including traditional fiat and cryptocurrencies. Ideally, the platform should support UPI transfers for convenience and quick addition and withdrawal of funds. Platforms like Mudrex support one-click UPI payments\n\nAfter adding funds, you can search for Bitcoin (BTC) on the app or look for the Bitcoin symbol. Next, check for the latest prices of Bitcoin and enter the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy. For example, if Bitcoin is priced around $37,500 and you choose to buy $3750 worth of Bitcoin. After you make the transaction, you own 0.1 BTC.\n\nStep 4: Select a safe storage option\n\nSome platforms let you select how you want to hold your Bitcoin. While some applications store your assets in cold or hot storage for you, others use integrated wallets or store their crypto with preferred partners. This way, your precious holdings are protected from malicious attempts to obtain them.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you can invest in crypto using Mudrex\n\nTo begin with, Download the application.

The platform has an intuitive UI and supports easy fund addition using UPI, bank transfer, and crypto transfer. It\u2019s because of user-friendly features like these that we recommend Mudrex when starting your crypto investing journey.\n\nHow do I store Bitcoin?\n\nYou can store Bitcoin by using a hot wallet or a cold wallet.\n\nHot wallets are connected to the Internet, meaning you have to be online to use them. These could be mobile or desktop apps or entirely web-based. As a user, you need to secure your hot wallet with a strong password and two-factor authentication and practice safe browsing practices. Hot wallets store your private key on your behalf. Your private key is what you use to send crypto to someone else as opposed to your public key, which is essentially your wallet address where people can send you crypto.\n\nCold wallets enable users to store their private keys offline. They do not store information digitally and provide an additional layer of security to the crypto stored in the wallet. Users can view their portfolios using a cold wallet without risking the safety of their coins. However, cold wallets require some technical know-how to set up. There is an additional risk of misplacing or losing the cold wallet since it is an offline device.\n\nWhat are some important factors to consider before investing in Bitcoin?\n\nHere are some key factors that you should remember before buying Bitcoin:\n\n1. Make sure to DYOR (Do Your Own Research) about your financial goals, expectations, and investment timeline. Similarly, research the price movement of Bitcoin and analyze trends to evaluate potential price movement.\n\n2. Remember to time your investments for an optimal risk-reward ratio, i.e., choosing when to buy or sell investments to maximize the potential return (reward) while minimizing the associated risks if you make a lump-sum purchase. However, if you are setting up an SIP, you do not need to time the market, thanks to DCA.\n\n3. Ideally, you should only invest the money you can afford to lose if things go south. This rule applies to all your investments but is important when investing in high-risk, high-reward assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\n4. Next, you need to ensure that all your private information is secured with multi-factor authentication. This will ensure that any privacy and security concerns that may pop up are mitigated, as the information will not be available to malicious actors trying to steal your crypto.\n\n5. Choose a crypto exchange or app that is compliant with local and international regulations. This way, you can be assured that the platform is safe and trustworthy for you to make transactions on.\n\n6. The crypto market is still in a nascent stage and is hence prone to extreme volatility. However, Bitcoin usually bounces back better and stronger during subsequent market cycles.\n\nAre There Any Alternative Ways to Invest in Bitcoin?\n\nYes! You can purchase Bitcoin at a peer-to-peer marketplace from a Bitcoin holder, mine your own Bitcoin, invest in Bitcoin ETFs, or purchase Bitcoin from a Bitcoin ATM. Additionally, some platforms offer thematic crypto baskets which enable you to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nFor example, Mudrex offers 20+ thematic crypto baskets called Coin Sets that are based on certain themes from the crypto market. You can choose to invest in Coin Sets like the BTC 50 :: ETH 50 or Crypto Blue Chip - 5 to benefit from the growth of other top performers in the market along with Bitcoin.\n\nMudrex also allows you to set up recurring investments or SIPs in Bitcoin.
