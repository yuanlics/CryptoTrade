        "title": "El Salvador Adopted Bitcoin as an Official Currency; Salvadorans Mostly Shrugged - Yale Insights",
        "content": "Central banks in more than 100 countries around the world are considering adopting digital currencies to increase financial inclusion and the efficiency of payments for their populations; some countries\u2014including the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria\u2014have already launched such currencies.\n\nEl Salvador took a different path toward digital payments. In 2021, in order to promote financial inclusion and job creation and facilitate remittances, it became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. At the same time, the country launched Chivo Wallet, an app that offers many of the same benefits as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), including accessibility and the ability to pay peers and firms and make deposits and withdrawals both in U.S. dollars (the country\u2019s official currency) and in Bitcoin. But Bitcoin, of course, is different than a CBDC in many ways\u2014not least of which is that its value is not backed by a central bank.\n\nBecause of the interest in digital payment systems around the world, El Salvador\u2019s experience could be informative. But the country has been tight-lipped about its experience, much to the chagrin of the International Monetary Fund. Yale SOM\u2019s David Argente and Diana Van Patten and their co-author Fernando Alvarez of the University of Chicago developed a survey to get more information directly from people in El Salvador and have written a new paper, published in Science magazine, that analyzes Salvadorans\u2019 use of Bitcoin and Chivo Wallet.\n\nThey find that neither Bitcoin nor the app are getting much use, despite a battery of incentives put in place, an indication that governments may face an uphill battle in convincing their citizens to adopt new payment technologies in a way that furthers financial efficiency and inclusion.\n\n\u201cThis is as good as it gets for an experiment\u201d about the launch of a new digital currency, Argente explains. \u201cIt was a beautiful chance to study theories that we\u2019ve never had a chance to test.\u201d\n\nMuch of the publicly available information about the use of Bitcoin and Chivo Wallet in El Salvador has come in tweets by the country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele. Argente, Van Patten, and Alvarez did not receive responses to their requests for information from the government, so they decided to take their questions to Salvadorans themselves. In February 2022, in partnership with the research firm CID Gallup, they conducted an in-person survey of 1,800 representative households in the country to ask about people\u2019s knowledge and use of Chivo Wallet. They then hired a firm to analyze blockchain data of transactions involving the app to validate their findings.\n\nThe researchers were impressed by how many people were aware of and downloaded the app: almost 68 percent of potential users knew about Chivo Wallet; 78 percent of that group at least tried to download it. But from there, the numbers declined drastically. Despite incentives by the government\u2014including a $30 Bitcoin bonus, a discount on gas when bought with the Chivo Wallet, and the elimination of certain transactional fees\u2014almost 20% of people who downloaded the app hadn\u2019t used their bonus by the time of the survey and most people who spent their bonus didn\u2019t continue to use the app after doing so.\n\nFurther, more than 20% of people surveyed knew about the app but did not try to download it. The authors had expected that people might be skeptical of Bitcoin because of the volatility (and therefore risk) of cryptocurrencies in general. But instead, people shared that they did not trust the app or Bitcoin because they are not anonymous, as cash is. The latter explains why Chivo Wallet was not even used to conduct transactions in dollars. These are important findings for policymakers looking to adopt digital currencies in their own countries: like Chivo Wallet, any digital currency will require governments to keep a record of users and their transactions; if people don\u2019t trust the government or the technology, they won\u2019t use it.\n\nLooking for more insights? Sign up to get our top stories by email. Email Thanks for signing up\n\n\u201cThe issues of trust and privacy are going to be key,\u201d Argente says. If a lack of trust leads to a lack of adoption, that undermines the network effects that make digital technologies more useful. \u201cThat\u2019s something any government should keep in mind.\u201d\n\nThe authors\u2019 analysis of data on the blockchain\u2014the digital public ledger where Bitcoin transactions are typically captured\u2014validate their survey findings. Many wallets, including Chivo Wallet, are custodial, meaning they do not verify their transactions on the blockchain. But the authors could see certain transactions, including Bitcoin transfers between Chivo Wallet and other crypto wallets. The blockchain data was in line with the authors\u2019 survey results: transactions peaked around the time of the country\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin and then decreased significantly.\n\nThe paper is already having an impact: the IMF and United Nations have asked for more information about the authors\u2019 findings, as have entrepreneurs seeking to develop fintech products and people who follow developments in cryptocurrencies.\n\nArgente, Van Patten, and Alvarez, who also are collaborating on research into the adoption of a digital payment system in Costa Rica, where Van Patten grew up, plan to continue their work in this area.\n\nArgente says he is fascinated by the study of payment systems. \u201cThe promise of financial inclusion can be fulfilled if we figure out a way to provide technologies to people in a way that they can actually adopt them,\u201d he says."

These are questions many people have asked at one point or another, especially when the value of this digital currency starts to surge.\n\nThis guide will provide an overview of Bitcoin for beginners with the goal of answering all your burning questions. Also, learn where to invest in Bitcoin when you\u2019re ready and how to securely store your crypto for the long run.\n\nVault\u2019s Viewpoint on Bitcoin: BTC Meaning\n\nOriginally founded by an anonymous developer named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC) is the most widely used and popular cryptocurrency in circulation today.\n\nNew Bitcoins are still being created through a complex mining process, but only until the predetermined maximum of 21 million Bitcoin has been reached.\n\nBitcoin transactions are recorded on a ledger or \u201cblockchain,\u201d which keeps track of ownership as peer-to-peer transactions are made.\n\nYou can invest in Bitcoin through a number of crypto exchanges, but you\u2019ll want to set up a safe place to store your crypto for the long haul.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the most prominent and widely used digital currency available today, alongside other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT) and XRP (XRP). This virtual currency was created for the purpose of peer-to-peer money transfers that are decentralized, meaning central banks and other authorities are not involved in the process.\n\nSince BTC is an open-source project, bitcoins are brought to fruition, or \u201cmined,\u201d through a complex mining process that anyone can participate in. All Bitcoins created are recorded on a blockchain, which serves as a ledger and also records transactions made with the currency. There are currently around 19 million BTC created and in circulation, and a finite supply of 21 million BTC is the predetermined limit on this currency.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin can increase or decrease based on supply and demand similar to other investments. This means investors can drive up the price of Bitcoin by investing in coins at higher and higher prices, but that prices can drop just as quickly when demand falls. This is ultimately why the price of a single Bitcoin surged to a high of around $68,000 in November of 2021, only to drop below $17,000 just a year later. BTC price has been climbing ever since then, however, and a single coin is currently worth over $40,000.\n\nWhile individual investors can purchase an entire Bitcoin at a time, you can also invest in fractions of Bitcoin in nearly any dollar amount. Most people buy BTC and other cryptocurrencies on a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Kraken, then move their digital assets to a crypto wallet for long-term security.\n\nBitcoin Pros and Cons\n\nBitcoin may be a confusing concept for some, but it can help to think of Bitcoin and other crypto as a new kind of money that isn\u2019t managed by the government or a central bank.\n\nThere are many advantages and disadvantages that come with buying and holding BTC, however, and you should know about them before you get started investing in crypto.\n\nBitcoin Pros Bitcoin Cons Potential to build wealth through regular investment Highly volatile as an investment Separation from government authority Lack of government oversight Eventual scarcity Not widely used for payments (yet) Accessibility and liquidity Environmental concerns Cost-efficient way to send and receive money Potential for fraud Privacy Not protected by government insurance products\n\nBitcoin Pros\n\nPotential to build wealth through regular investment: Early Bitcoin investors who have stood their ground and held onto this asset are likely glad they did.

Privacy: While all Bitcoin transactions are stored and publicly available on the blockchain, stored information is limited to Bitcoin addresses. This means Bitcoin transactions may not be able to be traced back to a person\u2019s real name or other personal information.\n\nBitcoin Cons\n\nHighly volatile as an investment: The price of Bitcoin has been all over the place over the last decade, and no one knows what the future holds. This means you\u2019ll want to be careful about investing and never buy more Bitcoin than you can afford to lose.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been all over the place over the last decade, and no one knows what the future holds.

Not protected by government insurance products: Where money kept in a bank account is typically protected FDIC insurance or NCUA insurance, crypto doesn\u2019t have these government protections. Bitcoin and other digital currencies also come without Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance that protects money invested in traditional investment accounts (up to limits of $500,000, including a $250,000 limit for cash).\n\nHow to Invest in Bitcoin\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin is easy, but you\u2019ll have to figure out where you want to invest before you get started. These steps can help you start building a crypto portfolio with BTC and other digital currencies:\n\nStep 1: Choose a crypto exchange. Compare all the best crypto exchanges today and keep in mind that not all of them support Bitcoin. Look for an exchange that has an easy-to-use interface, enhanced security features and low starting balance requirements if you\u2019re a beginning investor. Some popular crypto exchanges to consider include Coinbase, Kraken and Crypto.com.\n\nCompare all the best crypto exchanges today and keep in mind that not all of them support Bitcoin.

Remember that you can buy fractions of Bitcoin at one time based on your goals.\n\nWhere to Store Bitcoin\n\nOnce you buy Bitcoin, you\u2019ll want to look for a place to keep it for long-term storage. After all, crypto exchanges are custodial, meaning they maintain control over your private keys. By moving your BTC to a crypto wallet, you can take power of your private keys and enjoy enhanced security for your digital assets.\n\nAs you look for the best crypto wallet, keep in mind that most cryptocurrency wallets fall into one of two categories:\n\nHot wallets: Hot wallets are crypto wallets that are connected to the internet and accessed digitally. You can use most hot wallets through a desktop, mobile application or web browser, although some hot wallets are only available through one or two of these means.\n\nHot wallets are crypto wallets that are connected to the internet and accessed digitally.

The lack of connectivity cold wallets have to the internet means many experts consider them to be the safest."

        "content": "Bitcoin Could Crash to $30K, According to VC and Ex-ARK Crypto Head Burniske\n\nChris Burniske, partner at venture capital firm Placeholder and former crypto lead at ARK Invest, has suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) could experience further declines before finding a local bottom.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, Burniske attributed the potential dip to factors related to \"macro adoption\" and \"new product development.\" He projected that BTC could drop to at least $30,000-$36,000 before reaching a local bottom and expressed the possibility of testing the mid-to-high $20,000 range.\n\nDespite the near-term bearish outlook, Burniske remained optimistic about Bitcoin's long-term prospects, asserting that it would eventually reach new all-time highs. He emphasized the importance of patience for investors, acknowledging that the path to recovery will be volatile.\n\nArthuer Hayes\u2019 recent posts also reflect the same sentiments as Burniske. The BitMEX founder posted that Bitcoin could dip to $30,000 to $35,000 due to a \u201cTradFi mini-financial crisis.\u201d\n\nBurniske's comments come amid a recent dip in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin losing significant value after briefly approaching $49,000. Despite starting 2023 below $17,000 and ending the year above $42,000, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain its momentum following the approval and trading of ETFs on Wall Street. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $42,083, still significantly below its all-time high of $69,044 reached in November 2021."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining company GRIID Infrastructure was set to begin trading in the US market Monday after going public in Canada earlier this month.\n\nThe Cincinnati-based firm has a mining facility in New York, as well as three in Tennessee. It made its public markets debut on Cboe Canada on Jan. 2.\n\nGRIID Chief Strategy Officer Harry Sudock said at the time that the company was working to list in the US as well. Now, the company said Monday it was slated to start trading on Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Adit EdTech.\n\nThe stock was trading around $7 at 11 am ET Monday, according to Google Finance data \u2014 down about 28% from its opening price.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin halving expected to hit on 4/20\n\n\u201cIn the short term, we are focused on growing our capacity and increasing our hash rate,\u201d Sudock told Blockworks earlier this month. \u201cUltimately, our goal is to continue expanding our power pipeline and leveraging operational excellence to be a leader in both bitcoin mining and energy innovation.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2018, GRIID began operating bitcoin mining facilities the following year. It had 20,623 bitcoin mining machines installed as of Sept. 30, according to a Jan. 9 regulatory filing \u2014 giving it a total hash rate of 447 peta hashes per second (PH/s).\n\nThe company\u2019s facilities use roughly 67% carbon-free power, it notes \u2014 a level GRIID expects to increase to 90% by the end of 2024. Its revenues in the third quarter of 2023 were $2.6 million, bringing its total revenue in last year\u2019s first three quarters to $8 million.\n\nGRIID CEO Trey Kelly said in a statement that the Nasdaq listing \u201cwill enhance our visibility, liquidity and broaden our investor base.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s newest public listing comes after GRIID secured a $525 million credit facility from Blockchain.com in 2021 and subsequently planned to list on the New York Stock Exchange \u2014 a move that never came to fruition.\n\nThe listing on Nasdaq also takes place before the upcoming bitcoin halving, slated for April. The event marks a reduction of per-block rewards for mining bitcoin from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price tracking ahead of the past 2 halvings \u2014 now 3 months to go\n\nDan Weiskopf, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), said that capital markets access is critical to growth heading into the halving.\n\nIn addition to top crypto holdings such as MicroStrategy and Coinbase, BLOK invests in bitcoin miners Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, Cleanspark and others.\n\n\u201cWe believe that companies in the private market are going to be at a disadvantage, so GRIID\u2019s decision to become public makes sense,\u201d Weiskopf told Blockworks. \u201cFor now the information available remains thin, so we are going to be watching on the sidelines as monthly and quarterly data is provided that builds the investor case.\u201d\n\nHow new, established public mining stocks are doing\n\nGRIID\u2019s listing comes about nine months after bitcoin miner Bitdeer began trading on Nasdaq last April via a (SPAC) merger with Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp.\n\nRead more: As SPAC IPOs have grown scarce, Bitdeer\u2019s success bucks a trend\n\nBitdeer\u2019s stock price is down about 7% so far in 2024 \u2014 a trend seen around the mining space.\n\nThe stock prices of larger competitors Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms were down about 19% and 25%, respectively, year to date, as of Monday morning.\n\nCore Scientific saw its price plummet when re-listed on the Nasdaq following its exit from bankruptcy.\n\nHut 8, which merged with US Bitcoin Corp. in November, has seen its stock price decline by about 31% so far in 2024. Rivals Cleanspark and Bitfarms have seen dips amounting to about 20% and 12%, respectively.\n\nCompass Point Research analysts said in a Jan. 19 research note that the decline in hash price from $0.12 to about $0.09 earlier this month contributed to the miner stock sell-off.\n\n\u201cWe expect continued volatility and potential weakness as investors price in further hash price declines as a result of the halving that is expected in mid-April, which we think will provide good buying opportunities,\u201d analysts Chase White and Joe Flynn wrote at the time.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is down about 3.5% year to date, as the asset\u2019s price has steadily declined following an initial surge after spot bitcoin ETFs began trading on Jan. 11.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs Are Here. Why You Should Buy and Hold Long Term - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "On Jan. 10, the SEC finally approved the first-ever spot Bitcoin (BTC -4.63%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For good reason, they have been called the most important new product Wall Street has created in nearly 30 years. That's because these ETFs make the process of buying and selling Bitcoin so simple that practically anyone can do it.\n\nAs a result, the new Bitcoin ETFs could change the world of crypto investing forever. But there's one thing that they will not change: The need for a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy when investing in Bitcoin.\n\nCapture Bitcoin's long-term price performance\n\nWhile there are undoubtedly some investors who will actively trade these ETFs, or who will use them as part of sophisticated portfolio hedging strategies, they are designed primarily for only one purpose: To get passive exposure to the long-run price potential of Bitcoin.\n\nSince the new ETFs are backed by Bitcoin itself (and not by derivatives contracts attempting to replicate the performance of Bitcoin), they should offer a nearly 1:1 match with Bitcoin's performance. Unlike most other ETFs, which typically hold a very diversified basket of stocks, these new ETFs will only hold Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin goes up by 150% in one year (as it did in 2023), then your new ETF should also go up by 150% in the same year.\n\nThis ability to capture the long-term price performance of Bitcoin is very attractive, because just about everyone agrees that the price of Bitcoin has the potential to skyrocket higher. Bitcoin could soon eclipse its all-time high of $69,000 before breaking through the $100,000 level by the end of 2024. And you can easily find price predictions for Bitcoin well in excess of $100,000. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, thinks that the price of Bitcoin could top $1.5 million by the year 2030.\n\nBut the only way you will be able to capture the full long-term price performance is by buying and holding. If you are constantly moving in and out of the market, you will likely end up losing out on some of Bitcoin's gains.\n\nMinimize your total cost of ownership\n\nThat brings us to another key aspect of the new Bitcoin ETFs: They are designed to minimize your total cost of ownership. In a race to acquire as much investor money as possible as quickly as possible, the new Bitcoin ETF offerings often come with extraordinarily low expense ratios.\n\nIn some cases, the fees are as low as 0.20% per year. The fees are so modest, in fact, that some analysts have speculated that the big Wall Street firms may not make any money on them at all. (But don't worry, they'll find other ways to make the money back from you!)\n\nIf you are thinking about getting exposure to Bitcoin, there is only one calculation that you need to make. Simply add up the total costs of buying Bitcoin directly on a cryptocurrency exchange such as Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%), and then compare it to the super-low cost of owning the new ETFs. Unless Coinbase decides to lower its trading fees, it will almost always make sense to go with the lower-priced ETFs. At a near-zero cost, you can add Bitcoin to your portfolio.\n\nThat's why it doesn't seem to make sense to embrace a short-term trading strategy for Bitcoin. You'll be missing out on the cost advantages of the new Bitcoin ETFs and unnecessarily driving up your total cost of ownership. Not to mention the fact that you will likely be missing out on the inherent tax efficiencies of the ETF investment product.\n\nTake the emotion out of crypto investing\n\nFinally, there's something to be said for taking the emotion out of investing. Crypto investing, in particular, is known for its sharp swings up and down. The daily volatility can be jarring if you are new to crypto. And it can be very confusing to determine why a particular crypto is trading up or down at a particular moment.\n\nThat's why a buy-and-hold strategy can make so much sense. You can sit back and ignore the day-to-day volatility, confident that your ETF will ultimately trend higher over a long-enough time horizon. That's why many experienced Bitcoin investors have always preached a HODL (crypto slang for \"hold\") strategy: It's the best way to capture the long-term uptrend in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin for the long haul\n\nFor most investors, the new Bitcoin ETFs are likely the most efficient way to capture the long-term price potential of Bitcoin. They are a low-cost investment vehicle that takes away the need to monitor the performance of Bitcoin on a daily basis. So if you're going to buy one of the new Bitcoin ETFs, you should plan to buy and hold for the long term."

In a blog post, Hayes predicted a 30% correction for bitcoin, which reached approximately $48,000 immediately after the approval of multiple spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Jan. 10.\n\nAccording to Hayes, this correction could bring bitcoin down to the $33,600 level, ultimately establishing a new support zone between $30,000 and $35,000.\n\n\"A 30% correction from the ETF approval high of $48,000 is $33,600. Therefore, I believe bitcoin forms support between $30,000 to $35,000,\" Hayes wrote in the blog post.\n\nThe largest digital asset by market capitalization has traded mostly flat in the past 24 hours and was changing hands for $42,243 at 7:30 a.m. ET, according to The Block data."

        "content": "Experts Bet on $170K+ Bitcoin Price in Wake of 2024 Halving\n\nWith Bitcoin's next halving event just months away, optimism abounds that the cryptocurrency could reach dazzling new heights. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is among the crypto bulls forecasting eye-popping Bitcoin valuations in 2024 and beyond.\n\nScaramucci predicts Bitcoin will hit at least $170,000 in the 18 months following the halving in April when the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation gets cut in half. His projection is based on historical price performance, with Bitcoin tending to quadruple within that timeframe after previous halvings.\n\n\"The day that Bitcoin halves, multiply it by four and 18 months later and it\u2019s been uncanny that that\u2019s been the price of Bitcoin,\u201d said Scaramucci on a recent podcast.\n\nEven a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate of Bitcoin trading at $50,000 pre-halving would imply a $200,000 price tag post-halving, according to Scaramucci. Other optimistic forecasts come from Blockstream CEO Adam Back ($100,000+) and analysts at Standard Chartered Bank (also $100,000+).\n\nIn the long run, mega-bulls like Scaramucci see Bitcoin capturing half the market cap of gold, which would lift the cryptocurrency over $300,000 per coin. Scaramucci gave credit to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink for changing his once-negative stance on Bitcoin as digital gold."

(VSFG) said it aims to launch its spot bitcoin ETF within the first quarter, according to Bloomberg.\n\nGrowing interest in stablecoins\n\nMeanwhile, with Hong Kong stepping up efforts to push for stablecoin rules, several companies \u2014 including Harvest Global Investments, RD Technologies and VSFG \u2014 have shown interest in stablecoin-related trials, Bloomberg reported today.\n\nThese firms are in discussions with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city\u2019s de facto central bank, about potential stablecoin trials, according to the report, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nSean Lee, senior advisor and head of stablecoin at VSFG, told The Block that the company expects the stablecoin sandbox process to commence in the first quarter, with the duration lasting through the first half of 2024.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\u201cVSFG is dedicated to supporting Hong Kong as an international virtual asset center, and our dedicated division, IDA, will be applying for sandbox inclusion along with our consortium partners to demonstrate the potential of programmable digital money while fulfilling prudential requirements,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAn HKMA spokesperson told The Block that the sandbox arrangement is intended for fiat-reference stablecoin (FRS) issuers \u201cwho have a genuine interest in and a reasonable plan on issuing FRS in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe HKMA is preparing for the launch of the sandbox and will announce relevant details in due course,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nHarvest and RD Technologies have yet to respond to The Block\u2019s inquiries.\n\nIn December, the HKMA said in a joint consultation paper with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau that a stablecoin issuer would be required to obtain a license from the authorities \u201cif it issues a stablecoin that references the value of one or more fiat currencies in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nEddie Yue, chief executive of the HKMA, said at the time that stablecoins could \u201cbecome the interface between traditional finance and the virtual asset market.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a scenario where stablecoins become one of the preferred payment options by the general public, we should reasonably expect further integration between the digital payment ecosystem and the real economy, and whether the stablecoin is indeed \u2018stable\u2019 will then become ever more important,\u201d Yue said in a December statement.\n\nUpdates: Added comments from the HKMA and VSFG"

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving and Miner Economics \u2013 Coinbase Institutional Market Intelligence - Coinbase",
        "content": "The exponential growth of Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate to date underpins the strength and security of the underlying asset, making it relevant for bitcoin\u2019s economic fundamentals. An increase in the hash rate is an increase in the cost to fork or otherwise reorganize the network. In our view, however, hash rate growth is not limitless and may increasingly slow \u2013 or even shrink \u2013 following subsequent halving cycles. Mining machines have had smaller proportional efficiency gains relative to the growth of the network hash rate, and without significant bitcoin price appreciation, the revenue per unit of hash power could drop to all time lows following the halving in April 2024. Thinner margins could result in a larger proportion of forced selling by miners in order to meet fixed operational and financing costs, possibly making some miners unprofitable and increasing consolidation by well-capitalized entities who are able to acquire distressed assets at a discount. Although this is not an imminent threat to Bitcoin\u2019s sustainability, the drop in fixed block rewards does underscore the need for innovation that can drive miner revenue to support a strong network hash rate. In fact, recent surges in transaction fees have had an outsized impact on miner revenues compared to price movements. Absent any drastic price shocks, however, our overall view is that the network hash rate will likely continue to grow post-halving in the short-to-medium term, but may subsequently stall absent price appreciation or increased transaction fees. We think this could further push the Bitcoin community to explore solutions that sustainably drive miner revenue in the longer term due to renewed attention on Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate security.\n\nThe Decreasing Price Sensitivity of Miners The overall bitcoin mining market can be viewed as a globally distributed commodity manufacturing operation with costs consisting primarily of (1) upfront physical mining rig and infrastructure overhead and (2) ongoing costs centered on energy expenditure and operations. Normalizing miner revenues to daily USD earned per terahash per second (TH/s) of compute power reveals that miner unit revenues have not risen in line with bitcoin price appreciation in 2023 (see Chart 1). (Note: for succinctness, all subsequent measures of compute power are done on a per second basis.) In layman\u2019s terms, that means the increasing hash rate has likely absorbed most of the upside from higher bitcoin prices. Furthermore, it suggests that most increases in individual miner revenues have been driven primarily via the acquisition of more mining rigs. In fact, prior to 2022, short term price increases to bitcoin greatly outpaced the supply flexibility of the network hash rate, resulting in the revenue per TH closely tracking movements in price. Since early 2023, however, daily revenues per TH have remained comparatively range bound between $0.05 and $0.15. While revenues are still correlated with bitcoin price, the elasticity of miner revenue with respect to bitcoin price has dropped sharply (i.e. the magnitude of correlated movements has decreased). It is worth noting that the May and December 2023 miner revenue spikes above $0.10/TH/day were driven largely by a rise in transaction fees led by Ordinals usage, which saw transaction fees constitute more than 30% of total miner revenue at times (see Chart 2). In our view, the outsized impact of transaction fees on miner unit revenue is a result of the sporadic nature of this revenue stream, rendering established hedging strategies against the price volatility less applicable. This makes it difficult for miners to scale computing power based on predictable future transaction fees. For this reason, we think that the variability in transaction fees will continue to play an outsized role in miner revenue fluctuations, especially after the drop in fixed block rewards post-halving.\n\nMiner Positioning and Post-Halving Economics From a multi-year perspective, it is clear that the increasing saturation of the Bitcoin network hash rate is the primary driver of the decrease in revenue per TH (see Chart 3). Although the price of bitcoin far outpaced the more constrained growth of network hash rate throughout 2021 and 2022, the long term trend of hash rate has grown to meet bitcoin\u2019s USD price. It is also evident that improvements to custom bitcoin mining machines (application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs) has been a marginal contributor to increased hash rate \u2013 the 1200% growth in network hash rate and price over the last five years far outpaced the 170% improvement in ASIC efficiency gains during that time by seven-fold. Hash rate growth has been driven primarily by an increase in the total number of operating ASICs rather than optimizations in energy efficiency. The network hash rate currently has a growth rate of approximately 100% annually, roughly keeping pace with price appreciation since 2H22. Following the halving, however, we are on course to set a historical low of bitcoin-denominated revenue per TH (see Chart 4). In addition to fixed block rewards halving from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block, recent filings from public bitcoin mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms reveal plans to significantly increase their mining capacity in the short-to medium term by more than 30%. It is reasonable to think that other mining groups plan on doing the same (public miners constitute ~25% of global hash rate), which could further compound the downward pressure on revenues per TH. That said, we believe the hash rate still has some economically sustainable room to grow in the next few months prior to the halving as a result of increased transaction fees. Per our calculations, the realized network hash rate peaked at around 25% of the theoretical maximum sustainable hash rate through the 2020 halving, which we think still applies today (see Chart 5). Following the increase in transaction fees beginning in December 2023 the network is only operating at approximately 15% of the theoretical max. Echoing our earlier statement on the outsized impact of variable fee revenue, we have found that the maximum theoretical hash rate peaked on December 30 at the same time transaction fee revenue peaked, despite the price of bitcoin reaching a local top later on January 11, 2024. (Note: The theoretical maximum hash rate is computed by finding the maximum total hash rate that can be generated by 75% of state-of-the-art efficiency machines to have exact breakeven costs on energy at $0.02/kWh, all with zero profitability to cover any other operational costs or the initial financing of ASICs.) Assuming network metrics (bitcoin price, transaction fees, and hash rate) remain constant, the realized hash rate percentage would reach approximately 24% post-halving, in line with its historical \u201csoft-ceiling\u201d. However, miners would need to operate at a higher percentage of the maximum theoretical hash rate (approximately 32%) if transaction fees revert to pre-Ordinals levels \u2013 which may be unsustainable over the long-term for a subset of miners. Again, this discounts any variations to hash rate, which would likely skew these percentages higher as hash rate grows. The aforementioned ongoing investments into scaling would likely sustain the hash rate growth for several months after the halving in order to cover financing costs of new equipment and other operational costs. Beyond that, the path to profitable hash rate growth after that is less certain. It would require one or more of (1) bitcoin price appreciation, (2) reliable increases in transaction fees, or (3) unprecedented breakthroughs in ASIC efficiency. In our view, the post-halving miner economics could increase selling pressure on miners as margins narrow and less excess profit can be retained in bitcoin. This may not be immediately impactful to markets, however. As the rate of bitcoin issuance drops, the absolute number of bitcoin that miners can sell also drops \u2013 even if they are selling a proportionally higher amount of mining rewards. What may be more concerning is a scenario where miners need to sell portions of their unrestricted bitcoin holdings to finance future operations, though we don\u2019t think that would be likely in the near term. In the long run, however, decreased mining revenue margins is a potential threat to decentralization in bitcoin mining operations. We think the next halving will weaken the viability of independent, non-institutional miners from retaining profitability, which could further contribute to consolidation both at the miner and the mining pool levels. Institutional miners likely are better positioned to acquire distressed mining assets at a discount, have improved operational efficiency due to economies of scale, and have access to cheaper energy sources. Although concentration risks for private miners is unknown, the Bitcoin hash rate currently appears to be well distributed among miners, with the largest publicly traded bitcoin mining companies all below 5% of global hash rate. However, there is concern over the growing centralization of mining pools with two pools controlling more than half of the hash rate. If well-capitalized mining entities absorb smaller competitors, this centralization is likely to continue increasing.\n\nVariable Sources of Miner Revenue As fixed rewards drop post-halving, we think the future profitability of miners will increasingly rely on transaction fee driven revenue. That said, the path to achieving this is not straightforward. Fees also constituted a high proportion of block rewards through the 2017/18 and 2021/22 cycles where transaction fees similarly contributed 20%+ of transaction fees at various points. In our view, this is largely because periods of significant appreciation in bitcoin price draws increased network usage, which in turn drives up transaction fees. However, none of the increases to date have been sustainable (in contrast with Ethereum\u2019s consistent daily gas used ). Ordinals have been touted as one solution, though the volatility in Bitcoin Ordinals transactions suggests that such activity may be transient or cyclical in nature (similar to NFTs on Ethereum). Ongoing work in Bitcoin layer-2s (L2s) seem promising, though none have yet gained sufficient traction in constituting meaningful portions of transaction fees. Separate from mining bitcoin, some institutional miners can additionally profit from energy agreements with local governments where they are able to turn off mining operations and curb energy expenditures in return for energy credits. This, however, does not contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s economic security via active hash power, and also further advantages well-capitalized mining entities that can draw on reserves to weather variations in bitcoin price or periods of reduced mining activity. Thus, the creation of sustainable bitcoin network fees to miners beyond block rewards is imperative."

The firm had previously sold its shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) late last year, expecting to replace BITO with a spot Bitcoin ETF once it became available.\n\nARK Invest recently sold $5.2 million worth of Coinbase shares (COIN) after the US-based crypto exchange surged in anticipation of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Coinbase is named as the custodian of numerous spot ETF issuers. However, Cathie Wood remains bullish on the Bitcoin and crypto sector, famously calling a Bitcoin price target of $1.5 million by 2030."

But while Fidelity also offers its own spot bitcoin ETF, Schwab does not.\n\nRead more: Big ETF players remain on the sidelines amid possible milestone bitcoin fund approval\n\nThe Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) has seen $1.9 billion of inflows since launching on Jan. 11, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. That total is second only in the segment to the nearly $2.2 billion of inflows notched by BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst said in an X post Saturday that the success of rival Fidelity\u2019s FBTC could spur Schwab \u201cto file something sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re never first to market in anything but they make [a big] impact when they come in [with a] dirt cheap fee [and] 30 [million] active brokerage [accounts],\u201d Balchunas added.\n\nNate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, said in a separate X post that he agreed with Balchunas \u2014 calling Schwab\u2019s potential entrance into the segment a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d\n\nThough Schwab launched an ETF that holds crypto-related stocks in 2022, the company has not revealed any plans to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nA spokesperson for the firm told Blockworks Monday it does not comment on speculation.\n\n\u201cSchwab Asset Management continues to learn and hear from investors as to their investment needs and considerations for investing in bitcoin ETFs,\u201d the representative noted earlier this month. \u201cAs is the case with everything we do, if a decision is made by us to offer an ETF in this space, we will seek to deliver on those investment needs with a client focus.\u201d\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nThe predictions by some segment observers come as State Street\u2019s interest in spot bitcoin ETFs also remains uncertain. Fellow fund giant Vanguard meanwhile has repeatedly made its stance clear that it does not intend to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nJanel Jackson, global head of ETF capital markets, said in a Jan. 24 Q&A on the firm\u2019s website that \u201cwe do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios.\u201d\n\nVanguard also does not allow investors to buy or sell such funds on its platform.\n\nRead more: As spot bitcoin ETF volumes soar, Vanguard is blocking such trades\n\nJackson added: \u201cIn Vanguard\u2019s view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment.\u201d\n\nTen spot bitcoin ETFs have now traded for more than two weeks after a slate of fund firms gained long-awaited approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nDespite Balchunas and Geraci saying they expect Schwab to throw its hat in the spot bitcoin ETF ring, not all believe there will be more coming to market.\n\nSumit Roy, senior analyst at ETF.com told Blockworks earlier this month that he didn\u2019t expect any other issuers to launch \u201cvanilla\u201d spot bitcoin ETFs in the future.\n\n\n\nHe added at the time: \u201cBut I do expect that there will be more creative funds that add other types of exposures on top of just bitcoin.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Those wishing to purchase cryptocurrencies must go elsewhere,\u201d he said in a column posted Monday, adding that the decision \u201cdelighted\u201d him even as it angered crypto enthusiasts.\n\nVanguard historically often avoided offering in-demand funds that \u201ccrashed and burned\u201d for many peers, Rekenthaler noted.\n\n\u201cDoing so benefited its business far more than collecting a few billion dollars of incremental assets. Investors realized which fund companies had burned them \u2014 and which hadn\u2019t. Over time, they might have forgotten the details. But they remembered how they had been treated,\u201d Rekenthaler wrote.\n\nCritics might argue that bitcoin is different from earlier products that Vanguard avoided, as the proponents consider the cryptocurrency as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and a store of value, he noted.\n\n\u201cIf so, Vanguard could conceivably be called hypocritical,\u201d as it offers many single-commodity funds on its brokerage platform, including ETFs investing in gold bullion or oil barrels, Rekenthaler said.\n\n\u201cFine by me. First, simply calling bitcoin \u2018digital gold\u2019 does not make it so. Physical gold broke even during 2022\u2032s financials-market meltdown, while bitcoin\u2019s price collapsed,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cSecond \u2026 in Vanguard\u2019s judgment, cryptocurrency is currently unsuitable for its clients. In the future, that may change. But its ruling is for the here and now,\u201d the research said.\n\nVanguard\u2019s move is line with its late founder\u2019s philosophy, Rekenthaler wrote, noting that John Bogle (who died in early 2019) recommended investors \u201cavoid bitcoin like the plague.\u201d"

        "content": "A spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been one of the hottest topics over the past few years. Many investment companies, both traditional and crypto-oriented, have been filing multiple applications with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission over and over again.\n\nOn January 10th, 2024, the SEC finally gave the go-ahead and greenlighted a total of 11 Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nIt\u2019s been a hard-fought battle spanning many years, and if you want to check out the full timeline of the events, take a look at our detailed article on the matter:\n\nTimeline of Events Leading to Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval in the United States\n\nWith the approval already a fact, it\u2019s now critical to explore a very important subject \u2013 the difference between buying a spot Bitcoin ETF and buying Bitcoin directly and what might be better for you.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick table of comparison between both, while the following article provides a more in-depth look.\n\nWhat is a Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nExchange-traded funds have been a cornerstone in the world of traditional finance for many years.\n\nIn essence, an ETF represents a basket (or individual) of assets, and it trades on an exchange just like a regular stock does. It can track the price of various types of assets, including but not limited to securities, commodities, or other assets. It can track multiple assets or just one (as is the case with the spot Bitcoin ETF).\n\nIn the case of the Bitcoin ETFs, they provide a traditional and well-regarded investment vehicle to gain exposure to the price of BTC.\n\nThere is, however, a technical difference between the ETF itself and the asset that it tracks. Since the ETF itself is a standalone product \u2013 it has a market of its own and trades independently of the asset that underpins it. This is why there might be a difference between the ETF price and the net asset value (NAV) of the underpinning product.\n\nThere are other important takeaways that characterize the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, so let\u2019s have a look at a comprehensive summary.\n\nTrades on traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange\n\nBecause the ETF is a traditional investment product, it trades on regulated exchanges on Wall Street, such as the New York Stock Exchange. ETFs don\u2019t trade on cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance.\n\nInvestors don\u2019t own the underlying BTC\n\nOwning an ETF doesn\u2019t grant ownership to the underlying product. Think of it as a synthetic asset that\u2019s built on top of BTC, and it tracks its price. Investors who buy the ETF don\u2019t have to worry about storing and safekeeping BTC.\n\nThe shares in the ETF are backed by BTC, which is owned and stored by the ETF provider.\n\nThere are acquisition fees depending on the ETF provider\n\nThere are multiple Bitcoin ETFs, and each of them comes with different fees stipulated by the provider. In the case of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), there\u2019s a sponsor fee of 0.25% (T&C apply).\n\nManaged by the ETF provider\n\nETFs are managed by the companies that launch them. They can pull support if they don\u2019t meet certain criteria and can also change the fees at their own volition.\n\nTrades within traditional US trading hours\n\nBecause ETFs trade on traditional and regulated US exchanges like NYSE, they can only be accessed during regular US trading hours.\n\nThere might be an ETF/NAV price difference\n\nThere might be a price difference between the Bitcoin ETF and the price of Bitcoin on the same day. This is because ETFs trade on their separate markets, which dictate their current price.\n\nPros and Cons of a Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe above characteristics are specific to Bitcoin ETFs, and they bring certain advantages and disadvantages.\n\nPros:\n\nRegulated financial product\n\nIt can be included in specialized portfolios like retirement or 401(k)\n\nBacked by regulated and reputable providers like BlackRock\n\nCons:\n\nInvestors do not own the underlying BTC\n\nThere might be a premium on the ETF compared to the BTC NAV\n\nLimited trading hours and higher fees\n\nBuying BTC Directly\n\nAs opposed to ETFs, buying Bitcoin directly provides you with ownership over the BTC, regardless of whether you buy it from an exchange or P2P.\n\nOf course, if you do buy it through an exchange such as Binance, you should consider self-custody. This means that you should take your BTC off the exchange and transfer it into a cold wallet such as Trezor or Ledger, where you control the private keys.\n\nIn crypto, there\u2019s a popular saying that goes like this:\n\n\u201cNot your keys, not your Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThis also comes with certain responsibilities. Keeping your crypto safe can be a challenging task, especially if you have no prior experience. Worry not, however, as we\u2019ve prepared a detailed guide on what you can do to make sure your BTC is safe.\n\n9 Tips for Securing Your Bitcoin and Crypto Wallets You Must Follow\n\nJust as it is with ETFs, buying Bitcoin directly has its specifics. Here\u2019s a quick summary.\n\nTrades on cryptocurrency exchanges\n\nYou can\u2019t buy Bitcoin on the New York Stock Exchange. You have to use a cryptocurrency exchange. The most popular ones are Binance (outside of the US) and Coinbase (US).\n\nInvestors get direct ownership of BTC\n\nOnce you buy spot BTC on a cryptocurrency exchange \u2013 you own it. You can transfer it out of the exchange to a cold storage, or you can use it to trade against other altcoins such as Ethereum.\n\nAcquisition fees vary between crypto exchanges\n\nUnlike ETFs, there\u2019s no Sponsor fee. There are, however, trading fees associated with buying and selling BTC, and they vary based on the cryptocurrency exchange of choice.\n\nManaged by you\n\nSince you have complete ownership over the BTC you bought, you are also responsible for its safety. Self-custody comes with certain challenges, and it\u2019s imperative that you learn about cold storage and how to keep your crypto safe.\n\nTrades 24/7, irrespective of traditional working hours\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges work around the clock, so there are no limitations in terms of trading hours or weekends.\n\nDirect exposure to the BTC price\n\nYou don\u2019t have to worry about differences in the price of the ETF and the net asset\u2019s value. You\u2019re as exposed to the BTC price as it\u2019s physically possible.\n\nPros and Cons of Buying BTC Directly\n\nHere are the advantages and disadvantages:\n\nPros:\n\nYou get direct ownership of the BTC you buy\n\nYou can get full control through self-custody\n\nUnlimited trading hours and lower fees\n\nCons:\n\nStoring your BTC can be challenging and requires higher technical expertise\n\nCan\u2019t include it in traditional retirement plans and 401(k)\n\nNot recognized as a financial instrument\n\nBitcoin ETF vs. Buying BTC Directly: What\u2019s Better?\n\nThe above comprises the most essential differences between a spot Bitcoin ETF and buying BTC directly.\n\nThere\u2019s no one answer as to which is better, and it strongly depends on the individual preferences and needs of the investor.\n\nFor instance, if you\u2019re not tech-savvy, not interested in trading BTC against other altcoins, want long-term exposure without having to worry about safekeeping your crypto, and don\u2019t mind the higher fees, an ETF might be the better option.\n\nHowever, if you are well-versed in the crypto field and prefer direct ownership of BTC because you want to either safely store it on your cold wallet or you want to trade it actively against other altcoins, then perhaps buying BTC directly is the way to go."

        "title": "History Says This Cryptocurrency Could Soar More Than 120% in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It looks like Bitcoin (BTC -4.59%), after rising more than 150% in 2023, has shaken off the frost from the longest crypto winter on record. Yet as great as last year was for the world's original cryptocurrency, 2024 is shaping up to be equally impressive.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this, but the most evident and potent is related to evolving supply and demand dynamics and historical patterns. History doesn't always repeat itself, but it often rhymes. And if something similar to years past unfolds in 2024, Bitcoin might have what it takes to hit the coveted $100,000 mark, a gain of more than 120%.\n\nHere's why a six-figure Bitcoin this year shouldn't be ruled out.\n\nA half of a half of half\n\nOne of Bitcoin's more well-known qualities is its finite supply. With a maximum supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin derives much of its value from the notion that it will become scarcer with time.\n\nBut how does Bitcoin preserve this scarcity? The answer is relatively straightforward: It all comes down to a mechanism hardwired into its code known as halving.\n\nAfter every 210,000 blocks are added to its blockchain, or roughly four years, Bitcoin's supply growth rate is cut in half. Today, the annual growth rate hovers around 1.75%, but will fall to a measly 0.875% in April 2024 at the time of the next halving.\n\nWith 19.6 million coins currently in circulation, the halvings ensure that the remaining 1.4 million will gradually enter the market at a decreasing rate until sometime in 2040, the projected year when the last Bitcoin will have been mined.\n\nHalvings form the foundation of Bitcoin's robust monetary policy and long-term value proposition. But they also have an impact on more immediate short-term price dynamics.\n\nWhile there are other factors that affect Bitcoin's price, elementary laws of supply and demand play a major role. In the years that halvings take place, prices typically increase as demand is forced to compete for a more constrained supply. Most importantly, though, demand doesn't have to increase for prices to rise. Should demand not change and at a minimum remain constant, the reduced growth rate puts pressure on Bitcoin's price.\n\nWe can see evidence of this when tracking Bitcoin in years past. During the year in which a halving occurs, Bitcoin rises on average by 128%. While past performance isn't indicative of future results, if a similar situation were to occur in 2024, Bitcoin could reach a price of around $96,000. That's close to the six-figure mark, but not quite there.\n\nBitcoin enters unprecedented territory\n\nOn their own, halvings are significant events that alter Bitcoin's trajectory. But the halving slated for April 2024 will be unlike any other.\n\nFor the first time in history, there will be fewer Bitcoins available on the market than at the previous halving. In the past, Bitcoin's available supply increased significantly. However, a threshold was crossed with the passing of the most recent halving in May 2020.\n\nData extrapolated from the available supply on exchanges suggests that at the time of the May 2020 halving, which dropped the block reward to its current level of 6.25 Bitcoins, demand finally outstripped supply. Since peaking at 3.2 million Bitcoins in March 2020, the number of available Bitcoins has decreased by nearly 30% to just 2.3 million. It's the lowest level since March 2018.\n\nThere are likely a few factors explaining this phenomenon, but the most likely culprit are the notoriously stubborn Bitcoin holders who never sell. During the crypto winter, long-term holders underwent a phase of historic accumulation. Even as prices plummeted, die-hard Bitcoin investors continued to scoop up coins at what they believed was a discount. Today, the total number of coins held by long-term investors sits at 14.78 million coins, or roughly 75% of Bitcoin's total circulating supply.\n\nTo the delight of these long-term holders, they are the reason Bitcoin will find itself in unprecedented territory at the time of the April halving. With a lack of available coins on the market and reduction to its supply growth, Bitcoin's price could soar, to which degree remains to be seen. But given the magnitude of the supply crunch and the combined impact of the halving, a compounding effect will be introduced that should prove more than capable of pushing Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark."

        "content": "Bitcoin futures trading has soared after the launch of spot ETFs in the US this month, the FT reported.\n\nThe CME Group has seen trading of bitcoin futures contracts reach a new high.\n\nFutures traders are pursuing a \"cash and carry\" arbitrage trade on bitcoin, per the FT.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

As the contract's expiration date nears, these prices move closer together, and the trade can generate significant returns with low risk. Since the approval of the ETFs, the trade has garnered more attention as holding shares of the fund can be a cheaper way to hang onto exposure to the token.\n\nThe swell of activity has allowed CME to eclipse Binance as the largest bitcoin derivatives trading exchange in the world. The company tends to work alongside asset management firms and hedge funds.\n\nAs for other corners of Wall Street, the ETFs' launch has yet to trigger overwhelming bullishness as had been projected by some crypto enthusiasts.\n\nInstead, in the over two weeks of trading, crypto asset manager Grayscale has seen large outflows from its ETF, while bitcoin itself has flailed. The token whipsawed in the weeks since the SEC's approval, falling below the key $40,000 threshold last week, and is trading basically where at the beginning of this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a Thursday note, JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, highlighted that the spot ETFs will likely help deepen the crypto market and further developments could boost derivatives trading.\n\n\"The emergence of spot ETFs is introducing another dimension in the bitcoin price discovery process along with onshore spot exchanges and onshore futures that echoes the price discovery that is taking place in the traditional financial system, in particular in equities where ETFs are more prevalent,\" he wrote."

        "content": "Bitcoin demonstrated resilience by maintaining a price above $42,000, rebounding from a dip over the weekend. With the crypto community closely monitoring Bitcoin\u2019s movements, the digital currency encounters resistance at key levels, particularly at $43,600 and $45,589.\n\n\n\nThe recent launch of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States has generated a mix of excitement and skepticism. Economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff seized the moment to reiterate his warnings about the fate of the cryptocurrency.\n\nFallout from the Bitcoin ETF Launch\n\nDespite high expectations surrounding the debut of the first spot BTC ETF in the U.S., BTC fell short of meeting projections, prompting Peter Schiff to assert an \u2018I told you so\u2019 sentiment. Schiff, known for his skepticism of BTC, had previously cautioned about the \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 sentiment. Now, he contends that the crypto industry is downplaying the significance of the decline, dismissing it as a predictable event.\n\nSchiff\u2019s Perspective on Bitcoin\u2019s Value\n\nRestating his conviction that BTC\u2019s value will ultimately drop to zero, Schiff argues that the approved spot Bitcoin ETFs aren\u2019t creating new demand but merely shifting existing demand. He suggests that investors who might have otherwise invested in actual BTC or related equities are now opting for the new ETFs, resulting in a redistribution of demand. Schiff uses the metaphor of rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship to emphasize that such actions won\u2019t prevent the inevitable decline of the asset.\n\nThe Debate: $0 or $10 Million for Bitcoin\n\nIn the ongoing discourse about Bitcoin\u2019s future value, Schiff makes a bold prediction. He suggests that regardless of how low Bitcoin\u2019s price falls, its proponents will always assert its superiority over gold. Even in scenarios where BTC drops to $100 in 2031 and gold rises to $10,000, Schiff believes that BTC supporters will argue a 100x increase in the past 20 years compared to gold\u2019s 5x.\n\nNo matter how low the price of #Bitcoin falls, its proponents will always be able to claim its outperformed #gold. For example, even if Bitcoin falls to $100 in 2031 and gold rises to $10,000, they will claim that Bitcoin is up 100x in the past 20 years, while gold is only up 5x. \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 26, 2024\n\nAddressing the Possibility of a $10 Million Bitcoin\n\nWhen confronted with the hypothetical scenario of BTC reaching $10 million by 2031, Schiff deflects the discussion by pointing to the potential demise of the U.S. dollar. He proposes that if the U.S. dollar undergoes hyperinflation similar to the German Papiermark, then a $10 million BTC could become plausible.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s journey is marked by challenges and controversies, with opinions on its future value remaining divided. Schiff\u2019s persistent critique, rooted in skepticism and a longstanding belief in Bitcoin\u2019s eventual demise, contributes to the ongoing debate. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the scrutiny from investors, enthusiasts, and critics intensifies, awaiting pivotal developments that will define BTC\u2019s trajectory in the coming years.\n\nAlso Read: US Government to Sell $130M Worth of Bitcoin From Silk Road"

        "content": "The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) reportedly received its first spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) application just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first spot BTC ETF in the United States.\n\nHarvest Hong Kong \u2014 one of China\u2019s largest fund managers \u2014 submitted a spot Bitcoin ETF application to the Hong Kong SFC on Jan. 26, reported Tencent News. The report added that the regulatory body is actively working to expedite the process for approval of ETFs in the country to launch the first Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETF after the Chinese New Year on Feb. 10.\n\nAccording to the report, the Hong Kong regulatory body may follow a similar approach to the U.S. SEC and approve multiple spot ETFs to ensure a level playing field. While Harvest Fund might be the first applicant to file for a spot BTC ETF, it may not be the only one. Several regional financial institutions have signaled their interest in launching a spot BTC ETF in 2024.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Jan. 19, at least 10 financial institutions in the country are actively working to launch a spot BTC ETF. Financial giant such as Venture Smart Financial Holdings have already set the first quarter of 2024 as their target to launch the spot ETF.\n\nRelated: BlockShow unites with BlockDown for a crypto festival in Hong Kong.\n\nSeveral existing crypto companies that launched futures-based crypto ETFs in Hong Kong are also expected to be among spot Bitcoin ETF filers. \u200b\u200bSamsung Asset Management, which launched the Samsung Bitcoin Futures ETF in 2023, reportedly said it wouldn\u2019t \u201celiminate the possibility of exploring to launch a spot ETF.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has emerged as one of the leading crypto destinations in Asia thanks to its regulator\u2019s pro-crypto approach in 2023. The SFC created crypto-focused regulations in 2023, allowing institutional and retail investors to participate in crypto activities. Even before the U.S. SEC approved the first spot BTC ETF, the Hong Kong SFC opened the door for crypto-based ETFs and expressed its readiness to receive applications for the authorization of various funds, including digital asset spot ETFs and existing crypto futures ETFs.\n\nMagazine: Hong Kong\u2019s annoying new \u2018Travel Rule\u2019, $1.14B of 3AC\u2019s assets frozen: Asia Express"

        "title": "Vanguard Got Bitcoin Right - Morningstar",
        "content": "As you probably heard, the SEC has approved the creation of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Until now, Bitcoin purchasers either needed to create \"wallets\" on a cryptocurrency exchange or buy shares of a fund called Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nThe latter's structure was unattractive. Whereas ETFs' prices reliably match those of their underlying assets, Grayscale's often did not. (That no longer holds: Once the SEC lifted its ban, Grayscale promptly converted its fund into an ETF.)\n\nAs the Grayscale fund also carried a much higher expense ratio than the ETF newcomers, Bitcoin owners have become doubly fortunate. They can now hold their cryptocurrency in cheap, well-regulated funds, without worrying whether their crypto exchange will be the next to be seized or whether they have lost their wallet\u2019s password. Operationally, there has never been a better time to hold Bitcoin.\n\nVanguard's Dissent\n\nNot, however, for Vanguard customers.\n\nNot only has the company forsworn creating a Bitcoin ETF, but it refuses to carry anybody else's Bitcoin funds on its brokerage platform. Those wishing to purchase cryptocurrencies must go elsewhere.\n\nNaturally, this decision angered Bitcoin enthusiasts, but it delighted me. That reaction is not personal. I would not buy cryptocurrencies myself, as they are speculations rather than investments (if an asset cannot generate cash, under any circumstance, then there's no reason to hold it except for the hope to sell to a higher bidder), but I do not begrudge others doing so.\n\nRead More: Is Bitcoin Ungovernable?\n\nThe Right Side of History\n\nMy conviction instead is, as Michael Corleone would say, strictly business. Throughout its history, Vanguard has often refused to go where others had trod:\n\n1) Government-plus funds. Such funds, which supplemented their \"income\" (the extra payouts were in fact capital gains) by selling call options on their bonds, were the industry's success story in the mid-1980s.\n\n2) Tactical-allocation funds. Following 1987\u2032s Black Monday debacle, competitors promptly launched funds that boasted of their flexibility. Unlike traditional asset-allocation funds, they would be able to dodge the next stock market crash.\n\n3) Short-term multimarket income funds. Don't ask. But they were the most popular new fund category in the early 1990s.\n\n4) Internet funds. The rage of the late 1990s. What artificial intelligence investing is today, internet funds were 25 years ago.\n\n5) 130/30 Funds. Once again, do not ask.\n\nAll of the above crashed and burned. The first group failed so badly that it hibernated for 30 years, before being revived recently as \"covered call\" bond funds (I need to write a column about those). The third and fifth vanished entirely. Tactical-allocation funds have haltingly survived, while performing poorly \u2013 on average, an annualised 2 percentage points behind traditional allocation funds. Finally, although internet funds eventually righted their ship after the 2000-02 technology-stock implosion, they possessed few shareholders while doing so.\n\nVanguard offered none of those funds. In each case, the organisation could quickly have sold additional shares, as those investments were much in demand. In each case, Vanguard demurred. Doing so benefited its business far more than collecting a few billion dollars of incremental assets. Investors realised which fund companies had burned them \u2013 and which hadn't. Over time, they might have forgotten the details. But they remembered how they had been treated.\n\nIs Bitcoin Different?\n\nTo be sure, Vanguard wasn't standing alone. Fidelity and Schwab (SCHW) also eschewed such funds, for example. But Vanguard took investor protections several steps further. Thus, while Fidelity and Schwab each launched no-transaction-fee fund platforms that gave investors what they wanted, albeit at the cost of steep underlying fees, Vanguard abstained, on the grounds that customers did not always know what was bad for them. The company has also on occasion warned investors away from its most popular funds. One prominent example was Vanguard Growth Index (VIGRX). In the late 1990s, investors who inquired about that fund received cautionary letters along with the fund's prospectus.\n\nIt may be protested that Bitcoin is a different animal than Vanguard's previous abstentions. Whereas the aforementioned funds were either gimmicky or very narrowly defined (few internet stocks existed in the 1990s), Bitcoin is a straightforward and reasonably mainstream asset. Its proponents regard it as digital gold, a commodity that serves as a store of value.\n\nIf so, Vanguard could conceivably be called hypocritical. Although the company offers only a single commodities fund, Vanguard Commodity Strategy (VCMDX), many from other organisations are available on its brokerage platform. If you seek ETFs that invest in gold bullion or barrels of oil, Vanguard does sell them.\n\nFine by me. First, simply calling Bitcoin \"digital gold\" does not make it so. Physical gold broke even during 2022\u2032s financials-market meltdown, while Bitcoin's price collapsed. As The Wall Street Journal's James Mackintosh tartly puts it, \"so far there is zero evidence that Bitcoin works as digital gold\". Second, that is not the point. In Vanguard's judgment, cryptocurrency is currently unsuitable for its clients. In the future, that may change. But its ruling is for the here and now.\n\nVanguard is Following the Bogle Mindset\n\nIt's unfair to expect today's Vanguard to act as its founder Jack Bogle would have done. Businesses cannot be managed on hypotheticals. In this instance, admittedly, there is no doubt about Jack's opinion. (Counselled Bogle: \"avoid Bitcoin like the plague.\") That detail, however, is irrelevant. What matters is Vanguard obeys not the letter of Bogle's law but its spirit.\n\nThe company's decision to exclude Bitcoin ETFs meets that standard. Whether Vanguard has selected the right ground onto which to make its stand remains to be seen. What matters is the mindset. Vanguard became the world's largest fund company partly because its management knew when to say no. That it remains willing to do so is a positive sign for the company's financial health \u2013 and for those of its clients."

        "title": "Swan Bitcoin Unveils Its Newly Formed Mining Business Unit - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Swan Bitcoin recently unveiled its newly formed Bitcoin Mining Business Unit as the parent company of the Bitcoin Financial Services Firm aims to go public within the next 12 months. Joining us now to discuss is Haa Zag, the chief investment officer at Swan Bitcoin and head of Swan Mining. Hello, Haa. Hey John, how are you doing? I'm very good. Thank you. I just came back from a week long vacation, so I'm just fully relaxed and ready to have this conversation. How are you doing? Very good, very good. I just came back from a week long business trip. So there's a lot happening at Swan as you know, one of us is more relaxed than the other. But yeah, but we're going to have a great conversation here. Uh Talk to us about this newly announced mining unit and the plan to go public in the next 12 months. Yeah. No, it's, it's super exciting times for us at Swan and I'll tell you like, I've done a lot of things in my career. This is probably like the, the wildest one by by far we build the mining operation in pretty much record time in six months, we, we went from zero to a little bit about 4.5 x of hashes and accounting. We have machines acquired in order to go above eight. So it's been super, super exciting. But this is all part of something bigger. We've been developing swan institutional and expanding Swan institutional throughout the last year. And mining is of course, one of the the biggest parts of that so far, talk to me a little bit about the decision that went into the mining unit. What kind of decisions were you making behind the scenes? What kind of conversations were being had and what ultimately led to Swan saying? Ok, this is a business we want to get into. Yeah, this actually started even before mining. So as we know it, one business of just buy, letting clients buy Bitcoin, right? We don't even have a sell button. So clients just buy Bitcoin with us is a business that the long term rates are gonna go to zero. And actually we're gonna be driving that trend towards rates, going, going to zero and fees going to zero, right? So long term, this is a product that has a marginal cost that it's close to zero. And as we know anything that has marginal cost close to zero in the in a long enough time frame, it runs to zero. So we've been for a while thinking about sources of diversification of revenue for for Swan and there are a lot of different fronts we're working on. Uh But if you look at Swan, one of the things that it's really, really strong with the company is our brand and the talents that we attract. Uh So through last year, we had massive amount of conversations and there are different areas that we're talking about, you know, investors coming to us, clients, coming to us and mining was something that was always recurring and coming back. So we started around June of last year, looking at passive investment in a mining company. And through the process of analyzing that, you know, we got more and more excited about certain things that we were seeing in the mining industry, you know, from the margins to seeing where it was in the cycle to see where the other companies were and said, well, why not make a move here and see if we can raise capital to actually go into mining, right? And it started small uh but quite very quickly, we were go to secure, I think a good amount of capital we started deploying and you know, the rest is history. We are where we are. But uh along this path, we developed Swan Institutional. So mining is part of Swan Institutional and inside Swan Institutional, we have different things as well. We're doing asset management, we're gonna be doing Bitcoin back lending. Um We're doing in investment management with, with clients uh you know, launching an R A uh there's an uh starting to have something that looks and feels a lot like investment banking that we're building inside the institutional. So, again, super, super exciting times for us. Uh I keep saying that a lot of the things that I'm seeing on the, on the Bitcoin space right now, they go back to what I saw in the banking industry, like in the late nineties, early two thousands, a lot of talent coming in a lot of opportunity. Uh And yes, so this is how, how we got where we are. Um And as I said, it's, it's great to see, you know, that the team was able to deliver, implement everything in record amount of time. And, you know, super excited for this year. Have I want to talk about your experience in trad I in just a second. But I have to ask you why diversify into mining when all the mining companies are diversifying and looking at other ways to supplement their business, it feels a little bit backwards when we, we look at this at face value. Yeah. And I think, you know, when you look at what we did and when we started timing is everything, right? So when we started ASIC prices were like in the bottom of the bottom, right? So we're looking at the machine prices and thinking about acquiring. So we had the opportunity to buy machines or, you know, top notch machines, high quality machines at very low historical prices. When you look at the, the the public mining companies or the mining companies have been around, some of these have been buying, you know, machine as at like 90 $100 per terra has. And we are looking at machines, you know, at 12 $15 per tera has so significantly lower. So it got very attractive to us to acquire machines and to build the fleet at those prices. The other thing is we were able to secure capital at a very, very low cost. It's like a capital that looks much more like equity. So we shared the upside, it's segregated from Swan. So it made a lot of sense sense for us as a company to build something like that where, you know, we have an upside on an industry that we like, we want to be close to. We're getting, we think at the very low end of the cycle, you know, and looking ahead at where we think Bitcoin prices are gonna be. It's a leverage play in Bitcoin at the end of the day. Right. And we're here exactly for that. Where do you think Bitcoin prices are going? Yeah. You know, I don't make predictions after being in Bitcoin, let me write to you said, where you think the Bitcoin prices are going to be now you much higher, significantly higher. So I, well, I'll tell you this, I wrote, uh there's another thing that we've built last year, which is called Nakamoto portfolio.com. Uh It's a set of tools from Swan that financial advisors can come in, can put portfolios in, can see how Bitcoin would react on their portfolios, how much they should size the allocation of Bitcoin. But there is one piece in there that is called the Schroeder model. Uh where I compare Bitcoin with different asset classes. And what would happen if Bitcoin captured the monetary premium of assets like gold real estate even at very small amounts. And if you run the numbers there, you can see that, you know, the potential for Bitcoin prices are significantly higher than, than where we are, you know, orders of magnitude higher. Now, on price predictions, it's very, very hard to predict prices in Bitcoin, right? And I guarantee that anybody making a price prediction is going to be wrong. Uh Eventually they're all gonna be right at some point. But in the short term, knowing exactly when things are gonna happen is just, it's, it's impossible because it's a very, very small asset. You know, it's we're in the infancy of the uh of Bitcoin and trying to see, you know, where you're gonna see the supply and demand changing. It's just very, very hard to do at this point. Now, from uh the mining units perspective, how are you preparing for the having we know the having is coming up in Q two this year, rewards are gonna be slashed in half from a business perspective. How are you looking at that? Yeah, I think as I said, one of the advantages we have is that we have a very new fleet since we bought machines throughout last year, our machines are very efficient. We're able also to secure low energy costs in most of our sites. So if we look, that was part of all of our calculations as we were going through these sites and look at energy cost for us, right? First thing that came to our mind is like, OK, so what happens, we know we're profitable before the having, what happens after the having and not only after the next having, what happens after the following having? Right. So we're building the business with all of these things in mind. And the obvious thing is we need to the efficiency in machines. That's something that we're gonna have to uh improve a long time, but securing low energy costs. That's the the key for being a sustainable miner in the long term. And so far, I think we have some very good contracts in hand. I want to talk about Swan's financial services business now, you know, we just got the approval of the spot, Bitcoin ETF in the United States that's had a ripple effect on Bitcoin and crypto services across the globe. Have you seen any new interest from um from customers since the approval of the ETF or how has that affected business over at Swan. Yeah. Uh, like this is, it, it's game changing, I think for all of us. Right. I'll tell you, as you said, coming from the thread. I part of the world, uh, don't, don't hold that against me, but that's what I did. Uh, I'm starting to see a lot of people that had no interest in Bitcoin for a long period of time. You know, Cio s of big banks that I've known they're starting to ask questions around. Ok, so I see the ETF is out there now, maybe it's something I should be allocating to my client's portfolio. How should I think about sizing it fundamentally asking questions about Bitcoin. Why do I see Bitcoin, you know, is the best asset to have in a portfolio in the long term as the best collect that you can have. So definitely, I would say in terms of the the the change in interest and demand um that that's changing significantly, right? If you think about it, we now have the biggest asset managers in the world all making marketing for Bitcoin, right? We're gonna have Bitcoin in ads everywhere. Um They are all trying to sell their own ETS. But at the end of the day, there's one thing in common, they're all selling Bitcoin, they have to talk about the fundamentals of the assets, right? And when we look at where we are in the in the macro cycle, I think as I said, it's the perfect assets to, to hold and it will capture the vast amount of the monetary premium that we've seen flowing to assets for the last, you know, several decades. Right? I want to get your opinion on this. It's a question that's come up since the approval of the ETF some folks are saying, you know, this, this brings an aspect of centralization to Bitcoin that there wasn't before we're going to have large asset managers, many of them um from the trad five world holding large amounts of Bitcoin. How do you think of that? And if you are going to tell one of your trad five friends who are now interested in Bitcoin about what's going on? Uh What, what would you say? Yeah, I think, you know, the first of all talking about the concentration, it is a risk, right? And uh what we want to see in Bitcoin and part of why also we went into mining is to provide diversification and everything, right? So we need to have diversification in terms of wallets, addresses, you know, the users and everything else. Uh I'm not that worried in the long term about having a large player, a substantial part of it coin because that doesn't give them any power right? At the end of the day, the nodes are the ones that run the code and the ones that's really determine where Bitcoin is gonna be heading. Uh We've seen that again already in the in the block size wars. Right. So, even if uh Blackrock or whoever it is has 10% of Bitcoins, which they won't. Right. Uh It's not a problem at all. It's not like they can, this is not proof of stake where they can vote with, uh, with their shares, their shares, just give them economic expo exposure, but it doesn't give them any voting rights to anything in Bitcoin. So, on that, on that aspect, I'm not worried at all. You know, there's some talk about, well, maybe they can drive, uh, a fork at some point again, not worried about that. I think the money and the forks will flow through where they need. And we've seen there's enough historical evidence, that's where, where we're going to be heading, right? Um, when I talk to my thread, five friends and, you know, when they come to questions for me, it's funny like a lot of them are still in the early days. You're still asking like the questions that most of us had maybe 567 years ago. Uh, can governments ban it? Right? Can I buy less than one Bitcoin? How do I do self custody? It's actually good to see that a lot of them that actually have interest on the, on the ETF or asking? Ok. So I, I got into the ETF but I heard about it. I can also hold my Bitcoin. How do I do that? And that's part of trying to get them to understand how to do it and how to do self custody. Right? Uh Again, I think it's the, that's the beauty of Bitcoin is an asset that you can hold yourself different than anything else that, uh you know, we, we've ever seen, let's, let's uh take a little walk down memory lane and, and draw on your experience as a banker in the traditional finance world. If you gather up all that experience and your experience in the crypto world, where do you envision the intersection of Trad and crypto heading? How are these two areas of the financial world going to coexist in the future, do you think? Yeah, I think, you know, uh definitely, as I said, in the beginning, we're seeing a shift where traditional people that were in the traditional system, they are moving towards, I think Bitcoin and uh and trying to understand, you know, how it works. And I think everything that we saw being built on the traditional system, it's going to replicate and it's going to be replicated better on a Bitcoin standard. So that means that, you know, from custody as we discussed through asset allocation, through lending, these are all businesses that people are going to be doing over Bitcoin, right? And this is exactly why we created Swan Institutional is to leverage that and to build on that and to help clients to to get an understanding how to do, right? So we're looking at uh you know, financing and E A transactions in Bitcoin. We're looking at asset allocation, Bitcoin, same areas that the banks have built. So we look at, you know, I worked at gold money. We had GS AM that did asset management, right? We had investment banking and it's the same thing. We're rebuilding the same thing, but on the Bitcoin standard. Um and I think it's gonna be better, it's gonna be faster. it's gonna be, you know, the 10 X, what we we've seen in the past and as a new, any new industry, the exciting part of all of this, it's the only the things that we haven't even envisioned that are gonna happen, right? Uh The fact that you have something that is decentralized, that it's much faster that it's outside of traditional rails uh gives us a lot of opportunities that we probably haven't even thought about and are going to be happening, which again that occurs in any new technology, right? And whenever a new technology is created, everybody thinks about the applications comparing to what the last technologies were were around, right? We saw that with the internet where when email came in, people just thought about, you know, the internet is being in place for email where this will be the new post office, the electronic post office. And they couldn't envision there was much more to that, that, you know, the worldwide web would be developed and it's the same thing with Bitcoin. I think we are in the email area of Bitcoin and we are going to be saying, you know, applications that are gonna blow our minds in the, in the next few decades around it. And this is why value it's, you know, it's so depressed right now because the, the upside is much bigger than you can imagine have what we gotta wrap soon. But I have to ask you, is there a risk in your opinion that we replicate some of the bad parts of the tra traditional financial system in this new system that we're building. And if there is a risk, I see you nodding along. How do we start to think about uh avoiding that? Yeah, there are risks and that has happened and it has been happening a lot, right? Uh people trying to capture Bitcoin, um I think the beauty of it, it is definitely something that keeps me up at night thinking about, you know, what the risks would be, is this going to become an asset that is centralized, you know, within governments and it can only get in on ramps and off ramps or centralized, right? Uh It's all temporary, Jen, I think at the end of the day, they're gonna try it, right? They've tried in different ways, right? Bitcoin has been, how many times it has been banned in China? How many times Bitcoin mining has been banned in China, right? And the reality is that this is open source. It's decentralized. It's a software that anybody can run in a computer. It's just unstoppable. So I think everything that we're gonna see and we are gonna see. I think barriers that we're gonna have to overcome eventually in a long enough time frame, they're all gonna be gone. Haa, thanks so much for joining the show this morning. It was a pleasure chatting with you. My pleasure. Thank you. That was Chief Investment Officer at Swan Bitcoin and head of Swan Mining Haffa Zachary."

        "title": "Three Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Fell In January - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "In short, an overbought market after months of increasing certainty about the SEC\u2019s Bitcoin ETF approvals burst in January and allowed the price to correct some.\n\nHistorical #Bitcoin prices for today, January 26th: 2024 \u2013 $41,174\n\n2023 \u2013 $23,016\n\n2022 \u2013 $36,800\n\n2021 \u2013 $32,502\n\n2020 \u2013 $8,608\n\n2019 \u2013 $3,571\n\n2018 \u2013 $11,118\n\n2017 \u2013 $916\n\n2016 \u2013 $390\n\n2015 \u2013 $269\n\n2014 \u2013 $1,007\n\n2013 \u2013 $18\n\n2012 \u2013 $5.3\n\n2011 \u2013 $0.40 \u2014 Historical Bitcoin Price (@HistoryBTCPrice) January 26, 2024\n\nDuring this time, short-term traders helped pump the price, then went ahead and took profits after the Bitcoin ETF approvals by \u201cselling the news.\u201d\n\nFinally, tougher macro conditions, with a stronger dollar after a months-long slump, have led to more bearish sentiment for Bitcoin\u2019s overall outlook in January.\n\nHere are some more details:\n\nOverbought Market On Bitcoin ETF News\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry was ecstatic after a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale last August. The crypto hedge fund\u2019s lawsuit alleged that the SEC\u2019s decision to reject its Bitcoin ETF proposal was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe judge ordered the SEC to make a good-faith effort to approve an ETF. After that, Bitcoin price really began to heat up in October.\n\nWeek after week of new headlines with updates about the progress between over a dozen ETF applicants and the SEC kept pushing Bitcoin higher. The average exchange rate on crypto exchanges soared 80% in just a little over four months from $25,811 on Sept. 1 to $46,670 on Jan. 10. The average annualized ROI for that would be well over 200%. As JP Morgan predicted, the price had to cool.\n\nProfit Taking By Short-Term Bitcoin Price Traders\n\nSome Bitcoin investors follow a long-term strategy of accumulating and holding without selling. They are highly convinced that the upside left in cryptocurrency\u2019s global adoption curve is tremendous, and they are loathe to sell any of their holdings. But price arbitrage day traders were apt to take profits in January.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, says the falling Bitcoin price in January was an example of the \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d phenomenon in exchange markets for liquid assets. A Motley Fool report says, \u201cIt seems like some short-term traders bid up the digital currency\u2019s price in anticipation of the recent ETF approvals and then quickly took profits as the euphoria faded.\u201d\n\nTougher Macro Conditions, Bearish Sentiment\n\n\u201cOver the past two weeks, Bitcoin has been challenged by tougher macro conditions \u2014 evidenced by rallying rates and a strengthening dollar,\u201d wrote Sean Farrell, head of digital-asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, in a recent note.\n\nAs analysts for crypto exchange Bitfinex wrote in a note Tuesday, Bitcoin price fell in January because \u201cbearish sentiment appears to be prevailing.\u201d They expect key support levels at $38,000 and $36,000 if the correction continues, although Friday\u2019s 5% rally could mean a recovery is afoot."

        "title": "Bitcoin range consolidation sets the stage for SOL, AVAX RNDR and SUI - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been gradually moving up during the weekend, indicating continued demand from the bulls. Data shared by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on Jan. 26 shows that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) assets under management crossed the $2 billion mark.\n\nSolid buying at lower levels arrested the decline in Bitcoin, but a new bull market is unlikely to start in a hurry. Bitcoin may consolidate its gains as traders focus on the inflows into the newly launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and wait for the Bitcoin halving in April.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nIf Bitcoin enters a range, it will be a positive sign as it shows that traders are not hurrying to book profits because they anticipate the uptrend to continue. That may also be good news for select altcoins, which may attract investors\u2019 interest and resume their up move.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recovery has pulled select altcoins higher. Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin rose above the 20-day exponential moving average ($41,959) on Jan. 27, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages have flattened out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. The BTC/USDT pair may swing between $44,700 and $37,980 for some time.\n\nA break and close above $44,700 will be the first indication that the buyers are back in the driver\u2019s seat. That may propel the price to the local high of $48,970. On the downside, a slide below $37,980 could start a deeper correction toward $34,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that the bulls are on a comeback. The rally could reach $43,500 and then $44,700.\n\nOn the downside, the moving averages will likely act as a strong support. A break below the 50-simple moving average could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The pair may then slump to $39,500 and later to $37,980.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) climbed above the moving averages on Jan. 27 and is trying to sustain above the downtrend line on Jan. 28.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($93) has flattened out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating equilibrium between buyers and sellers. If the price maintains above the downtrend line, the SOL/USDT pair could attempt a rally to $107 and then to $117.\n\nIf the bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the moving averages. That may trap the aggressive bulls, opening the doors for a retest of the support at $79.\n\nThe pair has risen above the downtrend line, invalidating the bearish descending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. This is a positive sign as the bulls waiting on the sidelines enter on the failure of the setup, and the bears rush to the exit.\n\nIf buyers hold the price above the downtrend line, the pair is likely to ascend toward $107 and later to $117. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below $85.\n\nAvalanche price analysis\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has been trading inside a descending channel pattern for several days. Buyers purchased the dip to the support line on Jan. 23 and pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($34) on Jan. 28.\n\nAVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSellers will try to halt the recovery at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The AVAX/USDT pair may then spend some more time inside the channel.\n\nInstead, if the price pierces the overhead resistance, it will signal aggressive buying by the bulls. The pair may pick up momentum and rally to $44 and subsequently to the psychologically important level of $50.\n\nThe 20-EMA has started to turn up, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating solid buying by the bulls. Sellers have successfully defended the downtrend line on three previous occasions; hence, they will try to do that again.\n\nIf the price turns down from the downtrend line but rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will suggest that traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity. That will enhance the prospects of a rally above the channel. If that happens, the pair may start a move to $44.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that bears are fiercely selling at higher levels. The pair may then remain inside the channel for a while longer.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF ads may appear on Google starting Monday, community speculates\n\nRender price analysis\n\nAfter the initial pullback, Render (RNDR) has been consolidating between $3.56 and $4.40 for the past few days.\n\nRNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between the bulls and the bears. If the price turns down from $4.40 and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($4), the RNDR/USDT pair may extend its range-bound action for a few more days.\n\nContrarily, if the price rises above $4.40, it will signal that the buyers have overpowered the sellers. The pair could then rally to $5.07 and eventually to $5.28. A break above this level will indicate the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nThe pair has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. The buyers are trying to gain the upper hand by pushing the price above the triangle. If they succeed, the pair may climb to $4.40 and thereafter to $4.71.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will indicate that the bears are vigorously defending the downtrend line. The pair may then descend toward the support line.\n\nSui price analysis\n\nSui (SUI) has been in an uptrend for the past several days, but the bears are trying to halt the rally at $1.50.\n\nSUI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe SUI/USDT pair has formed a rounding bottom pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $1.50. If that happens, the bullish momentum could pick up, and the pair may rally toward $2. The pattern target of the positive setup is $2.64.\n\nHowever, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will fiercely protect the $1.50 level and attempt to pull the price to the 20-day EMA ($1.18). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the likelihood of a rally above $1.50 increases. On the other hand, a break below the 20-day EMA could open the doors for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.92).\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are struggling to shove the price above the overhead resistance at $1.50. If the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-EMA, it could start a pullback to the 50-SMA.\n\nAlternatively, if the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and every minor dip is being bought. The pair may then overcome the obstacle at $1.50 and start the next leg of the uptrend.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s 12-month volatility is the lowest on record, analysts say.\n\nUS Bitcoin spot ETFs are expected to continue smoothing the asset\u2019s price fluctuations over a longer time frame.\n\nBitcoin is becoming calmer. It\u2019s a trend that will entrench itself as US exchange-traded funds proliferate.\n\nBitcoin volatility is down\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 12-month annualised volatility has hit its lowest levels in 12 years, according to Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at wealth management firm Creative Planning.\n\nWhile there are fluctuations year-to-year, the overall trajectory shows a decline from a high of 179% in January 2012 to 45% in January 2024, according to Bilello\u2019s data.\n\nVolatility has been a hallmark of the asset class since inception, drawing investors eager to leverage its fluctuations for potential gains and simultaneously deterring those averse to risk.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 12-month annualised volatility serves as an indicator, reflecting the extent of the crypto\u2019s price fluctuations over a year-long period.\n\nA higher percentage denotes greater price variability, signalling increased market unpredictability, while a lower figure suggests more stable trading conditions.\n\n\u201cLess volatility could mean more long-term holders,\u201d Bradley Park, web3 analyst at onchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, told DL News.\n\nAppearing on Peter McCormack\u2019s \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did\u201d podcast earlier this month, Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, and Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said the introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs will further dampen volatility.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cA huge amount of it [Bitcoin] will sit in adviser accounts. They don\u2019t want to trade every day,\u201d Thorn said.\n\nSeyffart agreed, saying advisers with set target portfolio allocations would slash volatility while increasing fund returns.\n\nOver time, the value of assets in a portfolio changes due to market fluctuations. This can cause the actual allocation of an asset within a portfolio to drift away from its target.\n\nFor example, if Bitcoin\u2019s value increases significantly, it might comprise a larger percentage of the portfolio than intended, triggering rebalancing that\u2019s typically conducted quarterly or annually.\n\nIf the portfolio, for example, has a target allocation of 5% and Bitcoin surging by 80%, then advisers are likely to be selling their assets to avoid the cryptocurrency getting an outsized share of the portfolio, Seyffart said.\n\nIf Bitcoin \u201ctanks 80% they\u2019re going to be buying it to get it back to whatever their allocation is. They\u2019re going to try to keep that allocation at 5%,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is up 0.48% in the last 24 hours as of 11.50pm GMT, trading at $42,236.\n\nEthereum rose 0.43% in the same period, now at $2,266.\n\nAvalanche and Solana are down 3.43% and 1.22%, respectively.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nA British-Chinese woman has gone on trial for laundering bitcoin derived from a \u00a35bn fraud in China committed by her employer, a fugitive from the Beijing authorities, a court heard on Monday.\n\nJian Wen, 42, has been charged with three counts of money laundering on behalf of a Chinese woman called Yadi Zhang, Southwark Crown Court in London heard.\n\nZhang had stolen approximately \u00a35bn from more than 128,000 investors in China between 2014 and 2017 through a wealth management fraud before converting the money into bitcoin and arriving in London in 2017 under a false identity, prosecutors told the court.\n\nWen is accused of helping to convert some of the bitcoin into cash, jewellery and other luxury items, as well as property, \u201call to disguise the true source of the funds\u201d, said Gillian Jones KC, acting on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nJones told the jury at the opening of the trial that Wen was not involved in Zhang\u2019s fraud, but did not dispute dealing with bitcoin on behalf of Zhang. Jones asked the jury to consider whether Wen knew or at least suspected that the bitcoin she was dealing with were the proceeds of crime.\n\nWen, who moved to the UK in 2007 and became a British citizen in 2018, was \u201cthe front person\u201d who would \u201ckeep Ms. Zhang in the background\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat was what Ms. Wen was paid to do,\u201d Jones added.\n\nBefore meeting Zhang, Wen worked in Chinese takeaway restaurants and lived in a \u201crelatively modest accommodation\u201d. But in 2017 she began living in a rented six-bed manor house in north London with Zhang.\n\nZhang, whose real name is Zhimin Qian, has fled the UK and remains at large, Jones said.\n\nWen has pleaded not guilty to the charges. She called herself Zhang\u2019s \u201ccarer\u201d, and said she believed Zhang was a wealthy businesswoman who had made her fortune from a jewellery business and property portfolio, as well as from the legitimate mining of bitcoin, Jones told the jury.\n\nThe trial is expected to last until early March."

This policy change could see advertisements for the recently-launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) appear on its search engines.\n\nHowever, Google's policy update refers to the allowed products as \"advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States,\" leaving some ambiguity. Notably, one of the largest Bitcoin trusts, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), recently converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF following the SEC's approval.\n\nPreviously, GBTC shares were only available to accredited investors on the primary market, subject to a six-month holding period. Accredited investors must meet specific financial criteria, such as having a net worth over $1 million or a high earned income.\n\nIn contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs are available to the general public in the United States and are regulated under the Securities Act of 1933. This makes them a potentially safer option for Google to consider in advertising. The policy update is seen as a positive development, especially given Google's vast reach and influence in driving awareness and inflows for the 10 spot Bitcoin ETF issuers.

        "title": "More bitcoin ETFs offer yield \u2014 but where is it coming from? - Protos",
        "content": "A spate of ETF fund managers, including Proshares, Grayscale, Roundhill, and Simplify are announcing interest-bearing spot bitcoin ETFs that promise bitcoin exposure along with generous dividends.\n\nFor example, another firm, Purpose Investments, is offering 11.9% yield on its bitcoin yield ETF in Canada, while other ETF sponsors are aiming for highly variable rates starting at 0.49% and going as high as 33.19% (an annualized figure that is expected to decrease soon).\n\nGrayscale hasn\u2019t announced a yield but jotted 5% as a placeholder in its prospectus.\n\nThese new yield strategies are particularly salient given the decline in bitcoin\u2019s price since the SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on January 10. Since that date, bitcoin has declined about 8% from approximately $46,000 to near $42,300.\n\nMany bankrupt or troubled entities held GBTC and have been selling after its conversion to an ETF. All of these sales are anomalous stressors on the thinly traded bitcoin options market.\n\nSelling bitcoin covered calls\n\nMost of these ETF managers employ a popular strategy to generate these yields: selling covered calls. In other words, the bitcoin holdings of the ETF cover the call obligation of the sold option.\n\nA call is a bullish bet on the price of an asset. The buyer pays a small premium for the right to purchase a large amount of the asset at a fixed price before a specific date in the future. For example, a bullish Bitcoiner might pay $1,816 for the right to purchase one bitcoin at $100,000 before December 28 on Deribit. The bet only makes sense if bitcoin rallies above $101,816 before that date; otherwise, the contract expires worthless and the buyer has paid $1,816 for nothing.\n\nTherefore, selling a call is a bearish bet on the price of an asset. Specifically, selling a bitcoin-covered call obligates the seller to give their bitcoin to the owner of the call if the price of bitcoin rallies above the call\u2019s strike price before the call\u2019s expiration date. (A covered call where the seller already owns the asset that could be called from them contrasts with an uncovered call where the seller does not already own the asset.)\n\nAs a result, selling a call limits one\u2019s upside. If bitcoin rallies substantially, the seller of a covered call will not benefit from the price beyond the call\u2019s strike price.\n\nThe past week saw digital asset investment outflows of nearly $500m.\n\nRead more: New spot ETF cash inflows less than 0.1% of bitcoin\u2019s market cap\n\nBitcoin ETF yield in exchange for capped upside\n\nObviously, selling covered calls is a way to generate interest (also known as income or yield) on bitcoin ETF holdings. However, if the price of bitcoin increases quickly \u2014 as it often has throughout its history \u2014 the call option owners will call the bitcoin from the fund. This means that the ETF will not benefit from any further price increase.\n\nIn other words, yield-bearing spot bitcoin ETFs generate interest in exchange for missing out on quick, large bitcoin rallies.\n\nNevertheless, for most investors, the appeal of yield is attractive enough to avoid thinking too much about the risks. Few even ask the simple question, \u201cWhere does the yield come from?\u201d\n\nOf course, the yield must come from somewhere. But which parties, exactly, provide the yield for these high-yield bitcoin ETF investors?\n\nEvery sale is a buy\n\nUnlike many crypto exchanges that misreport up to 95% of transactions, compliant US clearinghouses require every sale to coincide with a buy. Specifically, when someone sells a covered call on a regulated US securities exchange, they usually pledge their collateral to an out-of-the-money call buyer with a strike price above the asset\u2019s current price.\n\nThere are variations on this strategy, including call spreads, cash-covered puts, or even using the bitcoin ETF as collateral to sell calls in non-bitcoin options markets. However, selling out-of-the-money bitcoin-covered calls is the safest and most popular method for generating yield on spot bitcoin holdings.\n\nTherefore, most of the yield for covered call ETFs comes from buyers of out-of-the-money calls.\n\nThat class of buyer is, by and large, bullish retail investors who want to use options for leverage on their bet that the price of bitcoin will go up quickly. This is a generally less sophisticated market of retail traders who are willing to pay expensive premiums to leverage their bets.\n\nOf course, market-makers who need to hedge positions on other crypto derivatives also buy out-of-the-money calls. For example, market-makers on perpetual futures crypto exchanges like Binance, OKX, KuCoin, or others might temporarily end up selling too many bullish perps. Overly short, they might then buy calls to protect themselves from a quick bull rally.\n\nNot without risks\n\nOptions are risky, leveraged financial instruments. Even selling covered calls \u2014 widely considered the safest options strategy \u2014 can stifle an investment\u2019s potential for far too little yield.\n\nUnlike spot bitcoin ETFs, which the SEC eventually approved after initially objecting, investors in covered call ETFs like Roundhill seek not only price exposure but also income. On Wall Street, there\u2019s no free lunch.\n\nRoundhill Investments\u2019 chief strategy officer said its new bitcoin covered call ETF would generate a monthly income with a monthly upside cap. Only time will tell whether that cap on bitcoin\u2019s price appreciation is worth the small amount of options-derived income.\n\nSince its bitcoin yield ETF launch this month, Roundhill has already made a dividend payout of $1.33 per share and plans to distribute variable dividends monthly.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin drops $60B from market cap as investors shuffle funds into ETFs\n\nDiscretion to use ETF holdings as collateral\n\nMost yield-bearing bitcoin ETFs grant generous discretion to the manager for decision-making about which options to trade or how much of the fund to post as collateral. For example, the manager of the Purpose Bitcoin Yield ETF may use up to 50% of the fund to collateralize covered calls or cash-covered puts.\n\nMoreover, the manager has broad authority to choose all of the permissible trades using the fund\u2019s collateral. As explained unambiguously in the fund\u2019s prospectus:\n\n\u201cThe decision as to which of the portfolio securities options will be written on, the number of options to be written on such securities, and the terms of such options will be based upon the manager\u2019s assessment of the market and of the best value offered by the option premiums available on the securities held by the fund at the time such options are written.\n\n\u201cCovered call options and cash-covered put options will be written at a strike price that is at-the-money or out-of-the-money as determined by the manager at its discretion.\u201d\n\nGot a tip?

Harvest is the first applicant, but up to 10 financial institutions have expressed interest in launching spot crypto ETFs this year.\n\nIn addition to ETFs, Hong Kong is pushing ahead with stablecoin regulations to support broader adoption. Harvest Global Investments, RD Technologies and Venture Smart Financial Holdings are in discussions with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) regarding potential stablecoin trials.\n\nThe trials would demonstrate the potential of programmable money while meeting prudential oversight. The HKMA plans to announce stablecoin sandbox details soon. Ultimately, stablecoin issuers may need to obtain a license if referencing Hong Kong dollars."

This excludes gray scales G BT C which had nearly 30 billion in assets under management at the time of its conversion from a closed and fund to a spot ETF. Now it really is all about Bitcoin on today's show. Our next guest has bridged the traditional finance world and the crypto world and has been spearheading a brand new business unit at Swan Bitcoin. Joining us now to discuss is Haa Zag, the Chief investment Officer at Swan Bitcoin and head of Swan Mining. Hello, Haa. Hey John, how are you doing? I'm very good. Thank you. I just came back from a week long vacation. So I'm just fully relaxed and ready to have this conversation. How are you doing? Very good. Very good. I just came back from a week long business trip. So there's a lot happening at Swan, as you know, one of us is more relaxed than the other. But, yeah, but we're going to have a great conversation here. Uh, talk to us about this newly announced mining unit and the plan to go public in the next 12 months. Yeah. No, it's, it's super exciting times for us at Swan. And I'll tell you like, I've done a lot of things in my career. This is probably like the the wildest one. By by far, we do the mining operation in pretty much record time in six months. We, we went from zero to a little bit about 4.5 x of hashes and accounting. We have machines acquired in order to go above eight. So it's been super, super exciting, but this is all part of something bigger we've been developing Swan Institutional and expanding Swan Institutional throughout the last year. And mining is of course one of the the biggest parts of that so far. Talk to me a little bit about the decision that went into the mining unit. What kind of decisions were you making behind the scenes? What kind of conversations were being had and what ultimately led to Swan saying? Ok, this is a business we want to get into. Yeah, this actually started even before mining. So as we know it, one business of just buy, letting clients buy Bitcoin, right? We don't even have a sell button. So lets just buy Bitcoin with us is a business at the long term rates are gonna go to zero. And actually we're gonna be driving that strand towards rates going, going to zero and fees going to zero. Right. So long term, this is a product that has a marginal cost that it's close to zero. And as we know anything that has marginal cost, close to zero in the, in the long enough time frame, it runs to zero. So we've been for a while thinking about sources of diversification of revenue for, for Swan. And there are a lot of different fronts we're working on. Uh but if you look at Swan, one of the things that it's really, really strong with the company is our brand and the talents that we attract. Uh So through last year, we had massive amount of conversations and there are different areas that we're talking about, you know, investors coming to us, clients coming to us and mining was something that was always recurring and coming back. So we started around June of last year, looking at the passive investment in a mining company and through the process of analyzing that, you know, we got more and more excited about certain things that we were seeing in the mining industry, you know, from the margins to see where it was in the cycle, to see where the other companies were and said, well, why not make a move here and see if we can raise capital to actually go mining, right? And it started small. Uh but quite very quickly, we were able to secure, I think a good amount of capital we started deploying and you know, the rest is history. We are where we are. But uh along this path, we developed Swan Institutional. So mining is part of Swan Institutional and inside Swan Institutional, we have different things as well. We're doing asset management, we're gonna be doing Bitcoin back lending. Um We're doing in investment management with, with clients. Uh you know, we're launching an R A. Uh there's an uh starting to have something that looks and feels a lot like investment banking that we're building inside institutional. So, again, super super exciting times for us. Uh I keep saying that a lot of the things that I'm seeing on the, on the Bitcoin space right now, they go back to what I saw in the banking industry, like in the late nineties, early two thousands, a lot of talent coming in a lot of opportunity. Uh And yes, so this is how, how we got where we are. Um And as I said, it's, it's great to see, you know, that the team was able to deliver, implement everything in record amount of time and, you know, super excited for this year. Have I want to talk about your experience in trad, I in just a second. But I have to ask you why diversify into mining, when all the mining companies are diversifying and looking at other ways to supplement their business, it feels a little bit backwards when we, we look at this at face value. Yeah. And I think, you know, when you look at what we did and when we started timing is everything right? So when we started ASIC prices were like in the bottom of the bottom, right? So we're looking at the machine prices and I think about acquiring so we had the opportunity to buy machines or, you know, top notch machines, high quality machines at very low historical prices. When you look at the the the public mining companies or the mining companies have been around, some of these have been buying, you know, machine as at like 90 $100 per terra has. And we are looking at machines, you know, at 12 $15 per tera has so significantly lower. So it got very attractive to us to acquire machines and to build the fleet at those prices. The other thing is we were able to secure capital at very, very low cost. It's a capital that looks much more like equity. So we share the upside, it's segregated from swan. So it made a lot of sense sense for us as a company to build something like that where, you know, we have an upside on an industry that we, like, we want to be close to. We're getting, we think at the very low end of the cycle, you know, and looking ahead at where we think Bitcoin prices are gonna be, it's a leverage play in Bitcoin at the end of the day. Right. And we're here exactly for that. Where do you think Bitcoin prices are going? Yeah, you know, I don't make predictions after being in Bitcoin, let me write to you said, where you think the Bitcoin prices are going to be now you much higher, significantly higher. So I, well, I'll tell you this, I wrote uh there's another thing that we've built last year, which is called Nakamoto portfolio.com. Uh It's a set of tools from Swan that financial advisors can come in, can put portfolios in, can see how Bitcoin would react on their portfolios, how much they should size the allocation of Bitcoin. But there is one piece in there that is called the Schroeder model. Uh where I compare Bitcoin with different asset classes. And what would happen if Bitcoin captured the monetary premium of assets like gold real estate even at very very small amounts. And if you run the numbers there, you can see that, you know, the potential for Bitcoin prices are significantly higher than, than where we are, you know, orders of magnitude higher. Now, on price predictions, it's very, very hard to predict prices in Bitcoin. Right. And I guarantee that anybody making a price prediction is going to be wrong, uh, eventually they're all gonna be right at some point. But in the short term, knowing exactly when things are gonna happen is just, it's, it's impossible because it's a very, very small asset. You know, it's, we're in the infancy of the uh of Bitcoin and trying to see, you know, where you're gonna see the supply and demand changing. It's just very, very hard to do at this point. Now, from uh the mining units perspective, how are you preparing for the having? We know the having is coming up in Q two this year, rewards are gonna be slashed in half from a business perspective. How are you looking at that? Yeah, I think as I said, one of the advantages we have is that we have a very new fleet since we bought machines throughout last year, our machines are very efficient. We're able also to secure low energy costs in most of our sites. So if we look, that was part of all of our calculations as we were going through these sites and look at energy cost for us, right? First thing that came to our mind is like, OK, so what happens, we know we're profitable before the having, what happens after the having and not only after the next having, what happens after the following having, right. So we're building the business with all of these things in mind. And the obvious thing is we need to the efficiency in machines. That's something that we're gonna have to uh improve a long time, but securing low energy costs, that's the, the key for being a sustainable miner in the long term. And so far, I think we have some very good contracts in hand. I want to talk about Swan's financial services business now, you know, we just got the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States that's had a ripple effect on Bitcoin and crypto services across the globe. Have you seen any new interest from um from customers since the approval of the ETF or how has that affected business over at Swan? Yeah. Uh like this is it, it's game changing, I think for all of us, right? I'll tell you, as you said, coming from the thread part of the world. Uh don't, don't hold that against me, but that's what I did. Uh I'm starting to see a lot of people that had no interest in Bitcoin for a long period of time. You know, Cio s of big banks that I've known they're starting to ask questions around. OK, so I see the ETF is out there now. Maybe it's something I should be allocating to my client's portfolio. How should I think about sizing it fundamentally asking questions about Bitcoin. Why do I see Bitcoin, you know, is the best asset to have in a portfolio in the long term as the best collect that you can have. So definitely, I would say in terms of the, the, the change in interest and demand um that that's changing significantly, right? If you think about it, we now have the biggest asset managers in the world all making marketing for Bitcoin, right? We're going to have Bitcoin in ads everywhere. Um They are all trying to sell their own ETS. But at the end of the day, there's one thing in common, they're all selling Bitcoin, they have to talk about the fundamentals of the assets, right? And when we look at where we are in the in the macro cycle, I think as I said, it's the perfect assets to, to hold and it will capture the vast amount of the monetary premium that we've seen flowing to assets for the last, you know, several decades, right? I want to get your opinion on this. It's a question that's come up since the approval of the ETF, some folks are saying, you know, this, this brings an aspect of centralization to Bitcoin that there wasn't before we're going to have large asset managers, many of them um from the trad five world holding large amounts of Bitcoin. How do you think of that? And if you are going to tell one of your trad five friends who are now interested in Bitcoin about what's going on? Uh What, what would you say, yeah, I think, you know, the first of all talking about the concentration, it is a risk, right? And uh what we want to see in Bitcoin and part of why also we went into mining is to provide diversification and everything, right? So we need to have diversification in terms of wallets, addresses, you know, the users and everything else. Uh I'm not that worried in the long term about having a large player, a substantial part of it coin because that doesn't give them any power. Right. At the end of the day, the nodes are the ones that run the code and the ones that's really determine where Bitcoin is gonna be heading. Uh, we've seen that again already in the, in the block size wars, right? So even if uh Blackrock or whoever it is has 10% of Bitcoins, which they won't, right. Uh It's not a problem at all. It's not like they can, this is not proof of stake where they can vote with, uh, with their shares, their shares, just give them economic expo exposure, but it doesn't give them any voting rights to anything in Bitcoin. So, on that, on that aspect, I'm not worried at all. You know, there's some talk about, well, maybe they can drive uh a fork at some point again, not worried about that. I think the money and the forks will flow through where they need. And we've seen there's enough historical evidence that's where, where we're going to be heading, right. Um, when I talk to my thread, five friends and, you know, when they come to questions for me, it's funny like a lot of them are still in the early days you're still asking, like the questions that most of us had maybe 567 years ago. Uh, can governments ban it? Right. Can I buy less than one Bitcoin? How do I do self custody? It's actually good to see that a lot of them that actually have interest on the, on the ETF are asking. Ok, so I, I got into the ETF but I heard about it. I can also hold my Bitcoin. How do I do that? And that's part of trying to get them to understand how to do it and how to do self custody, right? Uh Again, I think it's the, that's the beauty of Bitcoin is an asset that you can hold yourself different than anything else that uh you know, we, we've ever seen, let's, let's uh take a little walk down memory lane and, and draw on your experience as a banker in the traditional finance world. If you gather up all that experience and your experience in the crypto world, where do you envision the intersection of TRAD PFI and crypto heading? How are these two areas of the financial world going to coexist in the future do you think? Yeah, I think, you know, uh definitely as I said in the beginning, we're seeing a shift where traditional people that were in the traditional system, they are moving towards, I think Bitcoin and uh and trying to understand, you know how it works. And I think everything that we saw being built on the traditional system, it's going to replicate and it's going to be replicated better on a Bitcoin standard. So that means that, you know, from custody as we discussed through asset allocation, through lending, these are all businesses that people are going to be doing over Bitcoin, right? And this is exactly why we created Swan Institutional is to leverage that and to build on that and to help clients to, to get an understanding how to do, right? So we're looking at uh you know, financing and E A transactions in Bitcoin, we're looking at asset allocation, Bitcoin same areas that the banks have built. So we look at, you know, I worked at gold money, we had GS AM that did asset management, right? We had investment banking and it's the same thing, we're rebuilding the same thing, but on the Bitcoin Standard. Um and I think it's gonna be better, it's gonna be faster, it's gonna be, you know, the 10 X what we we've seen in the past and as a new, any new industry, the exciting part of all of this, it's the only the things that we haven't even envisioned that are gonna happen, right? Uh The fact that you have something that is decentralized, that it's much faster that it's outside of traditional rails, uh gives us a lot of opportunities that we probably haven't even thought about and are going to be happening, which again that occurs in any new technology, right? And whenever a new technology is created, everybody thinks about the applications comparing to what the last technologies were, were around, right? We saw that with the internet where when email came in, people just thought about, you know, the internet is being a place for email where this will be the new post office, the electronic post office and they couldn't envision there was much more to that, that, you know, the worldwide web would be developed. And it's the same thing with Bitcoin. I think we are in the email area of Bitcoin and we are going to be saying, you know, applications that are gonna blow our minds in the, in the next few decades around it. And this is why value it's, you know, it's so depressed right now because the the upside is much bigger than you can imagine have what we gotta wrap soon. But I have to ask you, is there a risk in your opinion that we replicate some of the bad parts of the tra traditional financial system in this new system that we're building? And if there is a risk, I see you nodding along, how do we start to think about uh avoiding that? Yeah, there are risks and that has happened and it has been happening a lot, right. Uh People trying to capture Bitcoin. Um I think the beauty of it, it is definitely something that keeps me up at night thinking about, you know, what the risks would be, is this gonna become an asset that is centralized, you know, within governments and it can only get in on ramps and off ramps or centralized. Right. Uh It's all temporary, Jen, I think at the end of the day, they're gonna try it, right? They've tried in different ways, right? Bitcoin has been, how many times it has been banned in China? How many times Bitcoin mining has been banned in China, right? And the reality is that this is open source, it's decentralized, it's a software that anybody can run in a computer, it's just unstoppable. So I think everything that we're gonna see and we are gonna see. I think barriers that we're gonna have to overcome eventually in a long enough time frame, they're all gonna be gone. Hava, thanks so much for joining the show this morning. It was a pleasure chatting with you. My pleasure. Thank you. That was Chief Investment Officer at Swan Bitcoin and Head of Swan Mining Haffa Zachary. It's time now to take a look at the chart of the day. The chart of the day is presented by crypto.com, the leading crypto platform trusted by over 80 million users worldwide. The analyst who predicted Bitcoin's recent slump to $38,000 now thinks levels above 43,000 are appropriate for taking fresh bullish bets on the largest Cryptocurrency by market cap 10 X. Research founder, Marcus Thin said in a note to clients quote with reversal indicators suggesting that a tradable low is in, we should focus on logs from a risk management perspective. We should re engage in long positions once Bitcoin breaks above $43,000 and quote, teen's bullish view is based on the Elliott wave theory which assumes that prices move in waves rather than simple patterns and future movements can be predicted by observing the repetitive wave pattern. Because of this teen predicts Bitcoin could see prices top $50,000 by the end of the first quarter. That's a wrap for first mover this morning. It feels fantastic to be back. Thank you so much for watching and thank you to our guest, Haa Zag. As a note sometimes on first mover, we do edit interviews for consistency and clarity. First mover is on a journey. We want this show to be the absolute best thing that you listen to every day. So if you have any feedback for us, just DM Me on Twitter, my handle is on the screen right now. We'll see you tomorrow for another fabulous first mover."

        "content": "Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could witness a \u201cconservative\u201d rally of over 300% in the coming months.\n\nIn a new interview with crypto influencer Scott Melker, the hedge fund veteran says that it would not be out of the ordinary for BTC to skyrocket to $170,000 after its upcoming halving in April when miners\u2019 rewards get cut in half.\n\nAccording to Scaramucci, data shows that BTC tends to print a cycle top that\u2019s 4x higher than its halving price.\n\n\u201cYou mentioned my $170,000 prediction\u2026 That\u2019s a data-dependent prediction. Go back and look at Bitcoin halving cycles. The day that Bitcoin halves, multiply it by four 18 months later and it\u2019s been uncanny that that\u2019s been the price of Bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019m using a $35,000 number at the halving and that\u2019s conservative\u2026 Let\u2019s say we\u2019re at $50,000 in April, then it\u2019s a $200,000 handle. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re at $60,000, it will be $240,000.\u201d\n\nScaramucci also predicts that in the long term, Bitcoin\u2019s price will hover close to half a million dollars.\n\n\u201cBut my long-term price target is that Bitcoin gets to easily half of the market capitalization of gold. Gold is now at $14.5 trillion. If Bitcoin goes to $7 or $8 trillion, that\u2019s a 10x from here. It\u2019s a $400,000 Bitcoin, and I think it would be ridiculous for people not to understand the asset, not to understand the dynamics of it as a store of value and not to have a position.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth, $42,478.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Becoming Less Popular Compared to Other Cryptocurrencies? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -4.46%) is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, with its name almost synonymous with crypto itself. But over the years, the crypto world has grown in size, and there are more digital currencies available. Let's look at just how popular Bitcoin is right now, and whether or not it has become less prominent over the past year.\n\nCoin dominance is an effective way to gauge popularity\n\nA key metric in crypto is how dominant a coin is compared to the entire crypto market. The calculation is simple: Take a cryptocurrency's market cap and divide it by the total market cap of all crypto.\n\nBitcoin, for example, has a market cap of around $760 billion. According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market has a value of $1.5 trillion, which would put Bitcoin's dominance percentage at approximately 50.7%.\n\nThis means it makes up a little more than half of the entire crypto market's total valuation. Ethereum, the next largest coin, has a market cap of $265 billion, putting its dominance percentage at 17.7%. No other cryptocurrency even comes close to a 10% dominance score today.\n\nHow Bitcoin's dominance has changed over the past year\n\nThe dominance percentage can and will change often, depending on not just the price of Bitcoin itself but other cryptocurrencies as well. Here's a breakdown of Bitcoin's dominance percentage at the start of each month, going back to January 2023:\n\nMonth BTC Dominance % January 2023 38% February 2023 41% March 2023 40% April 2023 45% May 2023 45% June 2023 44% July 2023 48% August 2023 47% September 2023 46% October 2023 46% November 2023 51% December 2023 50% January 2024 48%\n\nWhat's interesting to note is that Bitcoin's popularity actually increased over the course of the past year. A big part of that is likely due to the growing anticipation of the approval of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which finally took place earlier this month. Investors were expecting an uptick in Bitcoin's price due to the approvals, which may have also led to more people buying Bitcoin, hoping to cash in on the rising price.\n\nCan this upward trend continue?\n\nThanks to the approval of more ETFs, Bitcoin may be seen as the most easily accessible cryptocurrency due to the wide range of investing options that are now available. For new investors, it's the most well-known digital currency, and given its large size, it may also be seen as the safest option to choose from.\n\nGiven the high risk in crypto as a whole, new investors may be looking for ways to reduce their risk by going with a big name such as Bitcoin. This safety-seeking approach could lead to a further increase in its dominance percentage.\n\nAnother likely positive catalyst is the next Bitcoin halving, a regularly scheduled event that should take place in April 2024. Halving cuts the rewards for mining bitcoins to ensure that supply is controlled. In the past, halving events have been followed by an increase in the price of Bitcoin, for solid reasons of basic economy.\n\nMining will be less profitable if rewards go down and coin prices don't rise. This blockchain network can't process transactions without mining activity. Hence, the halving events are important moments for Bitcoin's economic model and can influence market dynamics.\n\nDoes Bitcoin's high dominance percentage make it the best cryptocurrency to buy right now?\n\nBitcoin's dominance percentage doesn't make the cryptocurrency a good buy on its own. It's simply a metric that can help investors understand market sentiment and see if Bitcoin is gaining or losing popularity. Furthermore, unexpected factors may come into play and change the trajectory of Bitcoin's dominance trend. But based on the current data, it's evident that Bitcoin remains incredibly popular in the crypto world.\n\nIf you are considering investing in crypto, Bitcoin may be your best option. Generally, when there is bullishness in the crypto markets, it's Bitcoin that is leading the charge. As the largest and most noteworthy digital currency, that's likely to be a pattern for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile new digital currencies will be smaller and could offer greater returns, there is the potential for even more volatility and risk as well. Bitcoin's strong continued dominance is a great way to gauge the strength of its brand in the crypto world. For new investors looking to gain exposure to crypto in their portfolios, Bitcoin may be the best way to do that."

        "content": "In a significant development for the cryptocurrency market in Hong Kong, Harvest Fund has officially applied to the first-ever Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nThe submission of this application by Harvest Fund is a clear indicator of the growing interest and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream financial markets.\n\nThis initiative follows closely on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first batch of Bitcoin spot ETFs just two weeks prior, a decision that has seemingly influenced the SFC's accelerated pace in this domain.\n\nThe potential approval of this ETF in Hong Kong could significantly broaden investment opportunities and attract a wider range of investors, including family offices that have previously been hesitant to directly engage in the Bitcoin market due to its complexity and perceived risks.\n\nAccording to Anndy Lian, an intergovernmental blockchain advisor, the Chinese stock market was one of the worst performers globally in 2023, funds looking for crypto alternatives are a big plus for the crypto industry.\n\n\"Harvest Fund ranked China's sixth-largest public fund manager. Having them filing for Bitcoin ETF would mean more Chinese money flowing into the ecosystem. This could be a start of seeing a rise in Bitcoin or Crypto Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) too,\" he says.\n\nRead Also: Unlocking Crypto Riches: Crypto Expert Shares Guide How To Value Tokens\n\nWhat\u2019s Next:\n\nThe SFC is reportedly eager to expedite the approval process for Hong Kong's first spot Bitcoin ETF, with plans to list it on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange shortly after the Chinese New Year.\n\nThis development could pave the way for multiple institutions to enter the market, mirroring the approach taken in the U.S., where firms like Grayscale, BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and Fidelity rapidly grew their ETFs' sizes.\n\nHowever, as of now, Harvest Fund remains the only institution to have applied, despite interest from others. Additionally, Hong Kong's ETF might distinguish itself from its U.S. counterparts by potentially allowing direct Bitcoin subscriptions, alongside traditional fiat currency subscriptions, offering a unique investment avenue in the region.\n\nRead Next: Coinbase's Outlook Brightens: Analysts See Positive Turn In SEC Legal Battle\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Bitcoin mining boosts the transition to renewable energy - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The global popularity of Bitcoin (BTC) has resulted in its network energy consumption sitting at 147.3 terawatt-hours per year as of Jan. 19, 2024.\n\nThis puts the network close to the yearly average energy consumption of countries such as Ukraine, Malaysia and Poland, according to the University of Cambridge.\n\nThis nation-state level of electricity consumption, no small part of which is generated by fossil fuels, has created a narrative of Bitcoin mining being harmful to the environment. Its carbon footprint, high energy demand and water consumption may be well-founded metrics but are often used to show only one side of the coin.\n\nFurthermore, the Bitcoin mining industry has been shifting toward alternative energy sources. On Jan. 18, 2024, Bitcoin mining sustainable energy usage hit a new all-time high of 54.5%, according to the Bitcoin ESG Forecast.\n\nThe adoption of clean energy by Bitcoin miners benefits the global climate. On top of that, Bitcoin mining has become an ideal candidate to boost the transition to renewable energies and offer promising potential revenue for the green energy industry.\n\nBitcoin mining can fund early-stage renewable projects\n\nA group of scientists from Cornell University in the United States determined that establishing Bitcoin mining operations in strategic locations could diminish the environmental footprint of cryptocurrencies by serving as revenue that can be directed toward future investments in renewable energy projects.\n\nIn the October 2023 study, researchers concluded that monetizing the excess power collected by renewable energy could earn hundreds of millions of dollars thanks to Bitcoin mining.\n\nThey stated that, in the U.S. alone, there is substantial revenue potential during the pre-commercial development phase of wind or solar farms. In this phase, the farms are generating electricity but not yet integrated into the broader grid.\n\nDevelopers could recover millions of dollars, which can then be invested in future renewable projects.\n\nTexas has the highest potential, according to the study, with 32 planned renewable projects that could generate a combined profit of $47 million by mining Bitcoin during pre-commercial operations.\n\nRecent: Big-tech firms like IBM and Amazon lead generative AI boom with new tools\n\nBitcoin mining can further provide a flexible customer to wind and solar energy installations, the peak production times of which may not always correspond to periods of peak demand.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin mining could give renewable utilities \u201cthe ability to play the arbitrage between electricity prices and Bitcoin prices,\u201d according to investment firm ARK Invest in a 2021 report.\n\nMargot Paez, a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute and a Bitcoin mining sustainability and environmental consultant, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s often a supply-demand mismatch that causes excess production of renewable power. Bitcoin mining acts as an off-taker that pays for the electricity that would otherwise be wasted. In turn, Bitcoin mining benefits from using renewable energy instead of fossil fuels, improving the network\u2019s carbon footprint. It\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\n\nBitcoin mining is location-agnostic\n\nBitcoin mining can move to wherever an excess of energy is produced, making it effectively location-agnostic. As researcher Fengqi You at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability mentioned in the study mentioned above:\n\n\u201cProfitability of a mining system hinges on periods of steady energy availability since renewable energy sources can vary significantly. [...] Therefore, it is important to site the mining farm strategically to maximize productivity.\u201d\n\nJaran Mellerud, co-founder and chief mining strategist at Bitcoin mining company Hashlabs, told Cointelegraph that there are two types of renewable energy sources that Bitcoin miners can use.\n\nThe first are variable renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Mining using these sources is challenging and often entails low up-time and constant interruption of operations.\n\nThe second energy source Bitcoin miners can use, per Mellerud, is baseload renewable sources like hydro and geothermal. Mining using these sources is much simpler, as they are more stable and can offer a higher up-time than wind or solar.\n\nBen Gagnon, chief mining officer at Bitcoin mining company Bitfarms, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cWe believe in the long run hydroelectricity should be one of the most cost-effective sources of power for many years to come, so we don\u2019t need to choose between being sustainable and being cost-effective.\u201d\n\nMellerud recounted a real case scenario where Hashlabs implemented a Bitcoin mining facility in Ethiopia powered solely by renewable energy sources. Ethiopian electricity generation consists of 94% hydro, 5% wind and 1% solar, with the country\u2019s 25% electricity surplus expected to grow as new hydroelectric power plants open.\n\n\u201cEthiopia\u2019s utility is monetizing some of this excessively generated electricity by selling it to us while waiting for the country\u2019s electricity consumption to catch up,\u201d Mellerud said.\n\nFor the Bitcoin miners, this activity is a win-win scenario, as they are helping the utility finance new electrical infrastructure buildouts for the country\u2019s growing population.\n\nRegulation hinders renewable energy transition through Bitcoin mining\n\nThe researchers from Cornell University highlight one significant problem for the Bitcoin mining industry to thrive: regulation. Bitcoin miner Mellerud confirmed this continuous worry within the industry:\n\n\u201cThe biggest hurdle of Bitcoin mining is regulations and associated political risk.\u201d\n\nThe Cornell study made a policy recommendation to provide economic rewards for environmentally responsible cryptocurrency mining, such as carbon credits for avoided emissions: \u201cThese rewards can act as an incentive for miners to adopt clean energy sources, which can lead to combined positive effects on climate change mitigation, improved renewable power capacity and additional profits during pre-commercial operation of wind or solar farms.\u201d\n\nThis approach radically differs from the attempt to apply taxes to crypto miners by the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBitfarms\u2019 Gagnon doesn\u2019t oppose the carbon credits proposal but pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s economic incentive is already enough for the industry to prosper:\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is the only economic incentive on the planet to voluntarily reduce energy waste and emissions not funded by a subsidy. It\u2019s the only one. There is no need for a government policy to incentivize this behavior! Bitcoin mining is the incentive to do just that!\u201d\n\nEnergy usage is not bad for humankind\n\nIn Gagnon\u2019s opinion, \u201cusing energy is not a bad thing.\u201d In fact, he thinks that the \u201cability to harness energy is a cornerstone of society and human progress.\u201d\n\nGagnon believes that humankind has advanced as the ability to harness more energy evolved. For the Bitcoin miner, energy \u201cis fundamentally what enables the world we live in today.\u201d\n\nHumans have benefited from the ability to find and utilize energy for all recorded time. Gagnon highlighted some critical milestones of human evolution where new energy sources had an important role: from the discovery of fire and burning wood to mills powered by rivers, whale oil for candlelight, coal for the industrialization of society, and the forging of steel to build railroads and skyscrapers to the discovery of the atom and nuclear power.\n\nMellerud believes that \u201cbigger countries on a state level soon will become more friendly toward mining and understand its potential for energy optimization.\u201d\n\nRecent: US elections: Are CBDCs becoming \u2018hyper-politicized\u2019?\n\nTo reach this goal, Gagnon believes the Bitcoin industry must work on \u201ceducation and outreach to demonstrate the positive benefits that Bitcoin mining operations,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is a tremendous force for good and a powerful story to be told. It just hasn\u2019t been heard yet by enough people, but as Bitcoin mining continues to prove itself as a force for good, it should inevitably be embraced.\u201d\n\nAs for Cornell University\u2019s conclusion, a shift in perspective is needed: Bitcoin should be viewed not merely as an energy consumer but as a facilitator for more efficient and sustainable energy use.\n\nBoth sides of the coin need to be considered, especially when the final objective is to improve global climate conditions."

        "title": "UK looks increasingly isolated in its anti-crypto ETF stance - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe UK is becoming increasingly isolated as one of the few major global markets to continue to hold back from approving retail access to cryptocurrency exchange traded products.\n\nContinental Europe has them, as do Australia, Brazil and Canada. The US has followed suit most recently with spot bitcoin ETFs, prompting Hong Kong to say it will also jump on board.\n\nYet the UK will not even let small investors buy those listed elsewhere even though Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has championed the UK as a crypto hub and has advocated for a regulatory framework that allows the sector to flourish in Britain.\n\nThe high-profile launch of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street earlier this month, some managed by household names such as BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity, has heightened the UK\u2019s divergence from most other financial hubs.\n\nThe UK\u2019s stance was defined by a ruling in 2021, when its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, banned the sale of cryptocurrency-related \u201cderivatives\u201d \u2014 including exchange traded products \u2014 to UK retail investors.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s ban appeared to be largely motivated by the emergence of leveraged products such as contracts for difference, with some operators offering as much as 100 times leverage on bitcoin, itself a highly volatile token. However, it also swept up unleveraged products such as plain vanilla ETPs and futures.\n\nSome industry figures disagree with where the FCA has chosen to draw the line. It did not intervene, for example, in the trading by retail investors of digital tokens directly via crypto exchanges.\n\nUK retail investors \u201ccan invest in crypto, just not through the regulated products\u201d, said Bradley Duke, chief strategist of London-based ETC Group. Its $1bn Physical Bitcoin exchange traded commodity is listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Paris, Frankfurt\u2019s Xetra exchange, the SIX Swiss Exchange and Chicago\u2019s CBOE, but cannot be on the London stock exchange because of the retail ban. In aggregate, continental Europe boasts 120 crypto ETPs with \u20ac8.4bn of assets, according to TrackInsight.\n\n\u201cA UK retail investor can\u2019t invest in a product like ours, a Mifid II [EU regulated] instrument, listed on a regulated exchange and sold through a regulated broker, who would screen you for applicability, depending on your investment objectives and profile,\u201d Duke said.\n\n\u201cBut they can go to a crypto exchange and buy bitcoin without going through any checks and balances, and to me that doesn\u2019t really make sense.\u201d\n\nAndrew Prosser, head of investments at InvestEngine, a London-based investment platform whose 34,000 clients hold \u00a3320mn across almost 600 ETFs, said UK retail investors had two options if they want crypto exposure.\n\n\u201cThey can either buy the coins themselves from digital exchanges. That comes with several problems: the need for digital wallets, private keys, the risk of theft. Or they can buy the shares of companies that track crypto, such as exchanges or miners,\u201d Prosser said.\n\nHe said there were lots of requests on InvestEngine\u2019s community forum for ETPs investing directly in crypto. \u201cSo there is demand for it,\u201d he said.\n\nHector McNeil, co-founder and co-chief executive of London-based HANetf, which lists six ETC Group cryptocurrency vehicles on its ETF platform, said it was \u201cgetting a lot more calls from advisers and discretionary fund managers\u201d, about crypto since this month\u2019s flurry of US launches.\n\nMcNeil said that the recent launches in the US with managers such as BlackRock and Invesco getting involved, meant the asset class was now mainstream. \u201cI think the FCA will have to reassess their position,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he did not believe the regulator should completely open the floodgates to all of the UK\u2019s estimated 9mn self-directed investors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with general access,\u201d he said, adding that with any more complex product there should be \u201csome sort of gating\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s somebody like me putting 3 per cent of their portfolio in, that should be fine. If it\u2019s my mother wanting to put 100 per cent in because her friend down the social club told her she made loads of money, then I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d McNeil added.\n\nBut he also said crypto ETPs were \u201cno more complex\u201d than inverse or leveraged products, where \u201cthere is a procedure for brokers to give access\u201d to investors who pass a suitability test and have an adequate balance sheet.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me it\u2019s more risky that trading 30 times leverage on a CFD [contract for difference] or spread bet,\u201d McNeil added.\n\nAll the UK regulator had done, he said, is to \u201cpush people to dodgy crypto exchanges. I don\u2019t think they have achieved what they wanted to achieve.\u201d\n\nSmall investors \u201care going through unregulated or under-regulated exchanges where there is no broker involved and there is no one looking out for the suitability of their investments\u201d, said Duke. \u201cThey have to hold the cryptocurrency themselves, which is risky.\u201d\n\nDespite these arguments, Prosser is not convinced the FCA, which declined to comment for this story, will buckle. When the regulator announced its ban in 2021 it also raised concerns about the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the underlying crypto market, its volatility and its links to financial crime.\n\n\u201cUnless the case can be made that crypto has meaningfully changed in the last three years, it\u2019s hard to see why the FCA would authorise them,\u201d Prosser said, while the FCA\u2019s Consumer Duty rules requiring companies to demonstrate fair value for clients, introduced last year, \u201cplaces a lot more duty to assess risk on investment platforms\u201d.\n\nJason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest, a DIY investing platform, agreed.\n\n\u201cI am personally doubtful that the FCA will authorise bitcoin or other cryptocurrency ETFs to be made accessible to UK retail investors any time soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FCA has repeatedly flagged concerns about the extreme volatility of cryptoassets, the high risk of losses and the difficulties retail investors face in valuing them.\u201d"

This move brings the sponsor fee for BTCO in line with most other issuers in the market.\n\nOnly a handful of issuers, including Ark and 21Shares, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, offer lower fees than Invesco and Galaxy Asset Management. To further incentivize investors, Invesco has stated that it will continue to waive fees for the first six months or until the fund reaches $5 billion in assets.\n\nDespite being one of the first traditional finance institutions to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, Invesco has had a slower start compared to some of its peers. BlackRock, for example, attracted over $2 billion in total assets under management in the first 11 days since the ETF was launched. Since its inception, Invesco's bitcoin spot ETF has seen inflows of just over $280 million. The lower fee structure is a strategic move to attract more investors and increase the fund's assets under management.\n\nThe fee reduction is a positive development for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated and transparent investment vehicle. Lower fees can lead to higher returns over time, making BTCO a more attractive option for long-term investors."

        "title": "New spot bitcoin ETFs: Addressing some initial questions - UBS",
        "content": "One of the main proposed use cases for bitcoin in portfolios is to potentially enhance portfolio diversification and risk-adjusted returns. (UBS)\n\nIn the past, bitcoin has been referred to as digital gold. Coincidently, spot bitcoin ETFs are very similar to gold ETFs. They are designed to closely track the price of bitcoin, less expenses. Expenses include the operating expenses, such as the management fee, and the trust\u2019s trading costs. The ETFs are structured as grantor trusts and are backed by bitcoin held by a custodian. The amount of bitcoin each ETF share represents will gradually decline overtime as bitcoin needs to be sold to cover trust expenses.\n\nSimilar to gold ETFs, there is the risk of theft and the custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the assets. The custodian is only liable for losses resulting from their own negligence, fraud, or willful default in their responsibilities. Importantly, the issuer also has a role in safekeeping and in execution even if the custody and the digital asset execution partner(s) are the same. So there are more differences than are immediately apparent based on reviewing the higher level information on the ETFs. These differences may/may not lead to meaningful performance disparities between the ETFs.\n\nFrom a tax perspective, spot bitcoin ETFs do not issue K-1s. While physical gold ETFs are treated as collectibles, spot bitcoin ETFs are treated as property. Therefore, capital gains are taxed at long- or short-term rates depending on the investors holding period. Separate from a shareholder buying or selling, there could be capital gains/losses reported by the issuer (reported to the shareholder via IRS form 1099-B) resulting from the sale of bitcoin to cover expenses.\n\nAdvantages\n\nFor most investors, spot bitcoin ETFs likely provide a simplified and more secure way to gain exposure to bitcoin, when compared to other approaches. The ETFs relieve investors from decisions/due diligence around custody/storage, crypto exchanges, and best execution when trading bitcoin. There's also the benefit of the enhanced liquidity from the exchange trading. While bitcoin futures ETFs also benefit from the professional management and the enhanced liquidity, they're not designed to track the price of bitcoin.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF investors do not have direct ownership in bitcoin and are bound by market hours for trading. The simultaneous approvals of the ETFs contributed to an immediate price war prior to launch, which helped to lower the cost of spot bitcoin ETFs for investors. While spot bitcoin ETFs could provide lower cost access to bitcoin than some alternatives, direct ownership may be cheaper for long-term investors who do not regularly trade their position. In this instance, the ongoing underlying fees of an ETF may be more impactful than the higher trading costs that may come with direct ownership.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nThe risks of spot bitcoin ETFs include all of those related to cryptocurrencies including, but not limited to, significant drawdown risk, regulatory changes, fraudulent activities, cybersecurity breaches, theft, and negative sentiment. The risks section of a spot bitcoin ETF prospectus are enough to give Freddy Krueger nightmares.\n\nFor the spot bitcoin ETFs, we also want to stress that the ETF structure doesn\u2019t eliminate the liquidity risk of the underlying bitcoin market. ETF prices can quickly reflect the cost of trading in that underlying market. The bitcoin market is especially volatile and there may be a significant cost for investors trading in volatile, illiquid markets.\n\nOne of the main proposed use cases for bitcoin in portfolios is to potentially enhance portfolio diversification and risk-adjusted returns. However, we'd caution that bitcoin is highly volatile and there have been three major drawdowns surpassing a 70% loss since 2014.\n\nOn a go-forward basis, while it's possible that bitcoin allocations are able to improve risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio, it's certainly not without risk. In the last 10 years, even a 10% allocation to bitcoin in a balanced 60-40 equity bond portfolio would have increased the portfolio\u2019s volatility and drawdowns to the levels of an all equity portfolio, and would have seen bitcoin drive about 50% of the portfolio\u2019s volatility. Given the correlation to global equities and high volatility/drawdown risk, we believe that there are more effective strategies if the objective is portfolio diversification.\n\nConsiderations for selecting a spot bitcoin ETF\n\nUBS does not provide advice on specific virtual assets nor with the selection of spot bitcoin ETFs. Given that the ETFs are each trying to track bitcoin prices, we expect a lot of attention will be paid to fees and liquidity. Investors evaluating spot bitcoin ETFs should consider the following:\n\nThe investment horizon dictates the relative importance of cost vs. liquidity. The longer the time horizon of the trade, the more important expenses become. The more tactical the trade, the more liquidity will matter in terms of ease of trading. We note that given shares can be created/redeemed, so there will be more liquidity than what may be apparent.\n\nBitcoin is a volatile asset, so minor differences in expenses likely don\u2019t matter much all things considered and shouldn\u2019t sway you from an issuer that you have more comfort/confidence in their ability to manage the product.\n\nGiven the importance of safekeeping of bitcoin and the potential for high volatility, investors may want to consider the issuer\u2019s experience (or the issuer\u2019s partner) within the crypto industry.\n\nWhile the spot bitcoin ETFs are likely to perform similarly to each other in calmer markets, this may not be the case during more volatile markets. It remains to be seen if the issuers will be able to distinguish themselves in terms of ability to manage the product during turbulent markets.\n\nFor much more, see the full report - Spot bitcoin ETFs: Exchange-traded funds , published 26 January, 2024.\n\n*If you direct a trade in a security tied to virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies, you do so on an unsolicited basis. Please note that UBS does not provide advice on specific virtual assets nor with the selection of spot bitcoin ETFs."

        "content": "Crypto investment products saw their second consecutive week of outflow this year, with $500 million leaving the funds, according to CoinShares\u2019 latest weekly report.\n\nBitcoin dominate\n\nBitcoin investment products experienced significant outflows last week, with a total withdrawal of $479 million.\n\nThe top cryptocurrency has faced significant headwinds since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the country. Its value has declined by more than 12% to around $42,500 as of press time.\n\nThis downturn has spurred bearish investors to turn to short BTC products, resulting in nearly $11 million in inflows last week.\n\nConversely, prominent alternative digital assets like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Chainlink also saw outflows, with $39 million, $700,000, and $600,000, respectively. However, Solana defied this trend by recording a modest inflow of $3 million.\n\nAcross regions, U.S.-based funds dominated the scene, experiencing net outflows of $409 million. Switzerland and Germany followed with outflows of $60 million and $32 million, respectively. Brazil emerged as the exception, with the most significant net inflows of $10.3 million.\n\n\u201cRecent price declines prompted by the substantial outflows from the incumbent ETF issuer (Grayscale) in the U.S. totaling $5 billion, have likely prompted further outflows from other regions,\u201d CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill explained.\n\nGrayscale outflows \u2018subside\u2019\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC sustained significant outflows, witnessing a withdrawal of $2.2 billion last week. Notably, this follows a substantial outflow of $2.8 billion two weeks ago, culminating in a total flow of $5 billion since the SEC approval of spot ETFs. However, recent data indicates a diminishing trend in the outflows, with Butterfill observing a gradual reduction in daily total outflows throughout the past week. \u201cThe outflows in Grayscale aren\u2019t pretty but it looks like they are beginning to subside,\u201d Butterfill said. In contrast, the newborn nine spot BTC ETFs, including BlackRock\u2019s IBIT and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, experienced robust inflows amounting to $1.8 billion. Since their launch, these ETFs have collectively attracted approximately $5.94 billion in inflows, resulting in a net inflow of $807 million when factoring in GBTC outflows. Globally, crypto Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) currently hold 900,000 BTC, valued at an estimated $36.2 billion, per ByteTree data. Notably, GBTC constitutes over 50% of this total, boasting a balance of 502,000 BTC, equivalent to an estimated $21.1 billion. Meanwhile, IBIT and FBTC\u2019s BTC holdings have flipped ProShares\u2019 futures BTC ETF (BITO) despite trading for fewer days.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "A popular process in financial markets, which attempts to predict the right timing for buying and selling assets, is called \"Buy on the rumor and sell on the news.\" This process involves buying the asset based on rumors surrounding a specific key event, but when the event actually occurs, the wise decision is to sell.\n\nThis phenomenon seems to have affected the price of Bitcoin in recent months as news accumulated regarding the ETFs approaching their scheduled date with high chances of approval.\n\nMany statements, preparations, and interviews by industry leaders added more certainty over time, leading to a significant increase in prices within a short period. However, at the moment of approval, the price reached its peak, and just a day later, it started to decline, even changing its short-term trend.\n\nWhy has Bitcoin dropped in value?\n\nAs of now, almost two weeks have passed since the ETF launch, and Bitcoin is trading at less than $40,000, which is considerably lower than the peak price of $49,000 at the time of the announcement.\n\nThe significant price drop can be attributed to investors closing their positions in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) due to significantly higher fees compared to competitors. Additionally, speculators and savvy players are taking profits after the meteoric rise since the beginning of 2023.\n\nIn terms of the leading ETFs that absorbed the largest amount of demand, the BlackRock (IBIT) fund and the Fidelity (FBTC) fund have been the frontrunners. However, it is worth noting that the Grayscale fund still holds the largest amount of coins by a significant margin. Only time will tell the long-term effects of these ETFs, as such price movements in the crypto market are common and routine."

A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike.

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin whales, investors who hold large amounts of Bitcoin, have notably increased their holdings. According to data analytics firm IntoTheBlock, these major players have added approximately $3 billion to their Bitcoin holdings since the beginning of the year, equating to around 76,000 BTC. This development is a key indicator of the confidence and investment strategy of the largest holders in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nHolder distribution\n\nThe term \"whales\" in the cryptocurrency world refers to individuals or entities that hold large quantities of digital currencies. Historical data reveals a dynamic shift in the distribution of Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe distribution of Bitcoin holdings across different investor classes provides further insights into market trends. Over a 30-day period, smaller holdings saw mixed changes: Accounts with 0-0.001 BTC increased by 1.02%, while those holding between 0.001-0.01 BTC and 0.01-0.1 BTC witnessed decreases of 1.90% and 1.36%, respectively. Notably, accounts holding between 10K-100K BTC saw an increase of 2.88%, reflecting a concentration of wealth at the higher end of the spectrum. When analyzing addresses by their holdings in USD, a similar trend emerges. Addresses holding less than $1 increased by 4.61%, while those holding over $10 million decreased by 2.15%.\n\nRecent trends show a 1.31% decrease in whale holdings over 30 days, juxtaposed with a 2.15% increase among investors and a marginal 0.02% decrease in retail holdings.\n\nInterestingly, the seven-day change in large holders' inflow increased by 119.83%, while the 30-day and 90-day changes showed a decrease of 83.23% and 91.25%, respectively.\n\nThis contrastingly large outflow in the short term, with an increase of 8,274.96% over seven days, indicates a volatile yet strategic play by these large holders, impacting the overall market sentiment and pricing.\n\nUnderwhelming price performance\n\nThe month opened with Bitcoin at a value of $42,208 and witnessed a notable surge, reaching a high of $49,000 following the approval of multiple Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency did not maintain this upward trajectory. Mid-month, Bitcoin saw fluctuations, with its price oscillating between $41,801 and $43,148, indicating a period of uncertainty and adjustment among investors.\n\nThis trend continued as the Bitcoin price dropped below the $40,000 mark. The latter part of January showcased a partial recovery, with the cryptocurrency closing at $42,120 on Jan. 27 after opening at $41,863."

        "content": "Bitcoin Whales Increase Holdings by $3B While Crypto Funds Saw Net Outflow Last Week\n\nBitcoin whales, or large investors, have accumulated $3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in January, according to data from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. This accumulation trend is evident in the increase of roughly 76,000 BTC in wallets owning over 1,000 BTC, bringing the total holdings to nearly 7.8 million BTC.\n\nThe surge in whale activity coincides with the launch of U.S.-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, which initially drove Bitcoin prices to highs above $48,900. However, prices faced downward pressure last week, dropping to lows near $38,500, as investors in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) cashed out. Despite the price pullback, some whales saw an opportunity to acquire coins at cheaper valuations through the crypto exchange Bitfinex.\n\nIn contrast to the whale accumulation, crypto funds experienced net outflows last week. Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) saw $2.2 billion of net outflows, while newly-launched spot Bitcoin ETFs saw just $1.8 billion in net inflows. This resulted in a net outflow of $500 million.\n\nHowever, the outflows of funds from GBTC is slowing, with daily redemptions declining through the past week, potentially suggesting that the selling pressure may be easing. On Monday, Fidelity\u2019s FBTC saw $208 million of inflows, surpassing the $192 million outflows from GBTC."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nTether (USDT) is poised to become the first stablecoin to reach a market capitalization of $100 billion.\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies, USDT\u2019s market capitalization is tied to its circulating supply.\n\nUSDT\u2019s prominence is evident in its extensive pairing across the crypto space and its daily trading volume.\n\nTether is on the brink of joining the elite group of cryptocurrency projects valued at tens of billions of dollars, a distinction currently held by only four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and CoinAid (BNB).\n\nWith a market capitalization of $96 billion, USDT is poised to become the inaugural stablecoin to achieve this significant market capitalization milestone.\n\nBitcoin and Ether Stand Firm in Elite Crypto Club as Others Fluctuate\n\nBitcoin first surpassed the noteworthy threshold in October 2017, journeying toward its initial peak of $20,000. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) were not far behind, though XRP briefly dipped below this benchmark shortly after reaching it.\n\nBNB marked its entry during the subsequent cycle, nearly touching $110 billion in market capitalization in November 2021, coinciding with Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high. However, its tenure in this exclusive club was short-lived, leaving only Bitcoin and Ethereum as the steadfast members.\n\nSeveral other cryptocurrencies have closely approached this mark. Cardano (ADA) achieved a market cap of $95 billion during the last bull market, while Dogecoin (DOGE) was on the cusp of $89 billion a few months prior. Solana (SOL) also made a notable impression, reaching around $77 billion during Bitcoin\u2019s peak at $69,000 over two years ago. Despite a commendable recovery in the past eight months, Solana\u2019s value is currently estimated to be roughly half of its peak.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING \ud83d\udea8$SOL JUST FLIPPED XRP'S MARKET\n\nCAP. SOLANA IS NOW A TOP 5 CRYPTO! pic.twitter.com/O4d7ed2VZS \u2014 Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) December 20, 2023\n\nThe chart below represents market capitalizations of various projects as though they were all initiated on the same date, notwithstanding some data gaps from the initial phases of certain projects:\n\nStablecoin Dynamics\n\nUnlike typical cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, whose market caps are derived by multiplying token prices with circulating supplies, stablecoins like Tether (USDT) operate distinctively. The value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether is determined through trading on crypto exchanges. In contrast, USDT\u2019s value is anchored to $1, and each token is intended to be supported by assets equivalent to one dollar, primarily in U.S. Treasuries, in Tether\u2019s reserves.\n\nMarket confidence generally holds that each USDT token is worth $1, contingent on Tether\u2019s ability to redeem tokens for actual U.S. dollars. While USDT\u2019s peg may occasionally fluctuate on certain exchanges, drawing scrutiny, these instances are more reflective of individual platform liquidity than of Tether\u2019s inherent value.\n\nThe perception of USDT being fully backed hinges on the value of Tether\u2019s holdings surpassing the total token supply, underpinning its recent strategic emphasis on highly liquid, short-dated U.S. Treasurys.\n\nUSDT Market Cap Mirrors Circulating Supply\n\nThe market capitalization of USDT is intrinsically tied to its circulating supply, dynamically responding to the demand from key ecosystem players like major traders, market makers, and liquidity providers. Tether directly manages the issuance and lending of USDT, historically reducing the supply (burning) during periods of low demand and increasing it (minting) when demand rises.\n\nUSDT\u2019s prominence is evident in its extensive pairing across the crypto space, making it the most traded cryptocurrency with a current daily volume of around $45 billion, according to CoinMarketCap . The company has been notably active in minting new supply, especially as markets anticipated the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nThe circulating supply of USDT surged to $85 billion last October, indicating that Tether has introduced over $10 billion in new tokens within three months, a period during which Bitcoin\u2019s value soared by 60%. If USDT\u2019s market cap reaches $100 billion, it would mark a significant milestone, positioning it as the slowest crypto project to achieve this feat to date."

        "content": "The analyst who correctly predicted bitcoin\u2019s {{BTC}} recent drop to $38,000 now sees levels above $43,000 appropriate for taking fresh bullish bets on the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cWith reversal indicators suggesting that a tradeable low is in, we should focus on longs. From a risk management perspective, we should re-engage in long positions once bitcoin breaks above $43,000,\u201d 10x Research\u2019s Founder Markus Thielen said in a note to clients on Monday.\n\n\u201cPotential catalysts for a move higher could center around the diminishing impact that the Grayscale GBTC selling could have on the price of bitcoin, the fact that stocks are making new all-time highs, and Google is allowing Bitcoin & Crypto ETF advertisements from today onwards,\" Thielen said.\n\nThe tech giant updated its ad policy in December of last year to allow Google-certified \"crypto coin trust\" operators to advertise on the search engine starting from Jan. 29.\n\nGoogle advertisement policy. (Google)\n\nThielen\u2019s bullish view is based on the Elliot Wave theory, which assumes that prices move in waves rather than simple patterns, and future movements can be predicted by observing the repetitive wave pattern.\n\nAccording to the theory, trends progress in five waves, of which, 1, 3, and 5 are \u201cimpulse waves,\u201d representing the primary trend. The rest are \u201cretrace waves,\u201d signifying a temporary halt of the primary trend.\n\nAccording to Thielen, bitcoin has been in a five-wave bullish pattern since early last year, with the recent pullback from roughly $49,000 to $38,500 constituting wave 4 or the temporary retracement. Now, wave 5 has begun and could take prices above $50,000.\n\n\u201cElliot Wave analysis has also labelled this retracement to 38,522 as wave (4) with a wave (5) projection of 52,671 \u2013 potentially by the end of Q1, 2024,\u201d Thielen noted.\n\nBitcoin's Elliot wave analysis (10x Research).\n\nThe bullish outlook is consistent with the decline in selling pressure from investors taking profits in the crypto investment vehicle, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The profit-taking was partially responsible for bitcoin falling into wave 4 correction following the launch of U.S.-based spot ETFs on Jan. 11.\n\nBitcoin changed hands at $42,160 at press time, representing a 0.3% gain on the day, according to CoinDesk data.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin is the oldest and biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization today, but how many Bitcoins are there available for new miners?\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nDubbed the \u2018King of Crypto\u2019, Bitcoin (BTC) was the first-ever cryptocurrency, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. A decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency and monetary system, Bitcoin relies on cryptographic techniques to safeguard and validate transactions, as well as generate new units.\n\nBitcoin is comprised of two key components. The first is the overarching concept and system, including the decentralized digital currency, underlying technology, user community, and extensive ecosystem. The second pertains to the individual units of the cryptocurrency, BTC. This differentiation is crucial for distinguishing between the broader concept of Bitcoin and the precise amounts of the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nHistory of Bitcoin\n\nAs the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin predates most crypto exchanges. The first ever bitcoin exchange took place over the Bitcoin Talk Forum \u2013 which, like the coin, went live in 2009 \u2013 when two forum users exchanged 5,050 BTC for $5.02 via PayPal putting the exchange rate at $0.00099.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be until 2011 when bitcoin reached the $1 mark as more and more investors began picking up the coin. From there it would only skyrocket, hitting $10 just a few months later and peaking at almost $30 that year. Though 2012 was relatively uneventful for BTC, 2013 would see the coin\u2019s price reach $250 in April and shoot upwards to over $1,000 in December.\n\nThough the next two years saw a someone spottier time for Bitcoin, by 2017, adoption of the coin was in full swing and the price soared to an all-time high of $19,345.49. However, it was 2021 that would see the crypto reaching its headiest heights to date, peaking at $68,789.63 in November as popular crypto exchange Coinbase went public.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s position as the \u2018King of Crypto\u2019 was not enough to provide it immunity from the Crypto Winter of 2022, and the coin saw a steady decline throughout the year, going from around $50,000 in January to under $20,000 in December.\n\nHow many Bitcoins are there?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s maximum supply is set at 21 million BTC. According to Ray Dillinger, who was involved in reviewing Bitcoin\u2019s early code, the supply cap was purposefully chosen by Nakamoto so that the smallest denomination of Bitcoin would always be worth less than $0.01, making it sufficiently divisible even as the world\u2019s primary currency.\n\n\u201c21 million, times 10^8 subdivisions, meant that even if the whole world\u2019s money supply were replaced by the 21 million bitcoins the smallest unit (we weren\u2019t calling them Satoshis yet) would still be worth a bit less than a penny, so no matter what happened \u2014 even if the entire economy of planet earth were measured in Bitcoin \u2014 it would never inconvenience people by being too large a unit for convenience. Ray Dillinger, BitcoinTalk\n\nIn an email with Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn, Satoshi Nakamoto further elaborated on this point, writing:\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin remains a small niche, it\u2019ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there\u2019s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.\u201d\n\nAs for how many bitcoins are in circulation, in January 2024, there was a total number of 19.6 million BTC in circulation, leaving just 1.4 million bitcoins to be mined. On average, new bitcoins are introduced into circulation roughly every 10 minutes, the same amount of time it takes to generate a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain. The number of bitcoins minted per block is halved after every 210,000 blocks, approximately once every four years, reducing the number of tokens being added to the supply.\n\nAt Bitcoin\u2019s inception, the block reward was 50 BTC, after 210,000 blocks were mined in November 2012, it was reduced to 25 BTC. In July 2016, after a further 420,000 blocks, the reward was reduced to 12.5 BTC. At the last Bitcoin halving event in May 2020 the reward was lowered to just 6.25 BTC. The next halving is expected in April 2024 and will reduce the mining reward to 3.125 BTC.\n\nWhat happens when Bitcoin reaches its maximum supply?\n\nBitcoin is estimated to reach its maximum in 2140, at which point miners will no longer receive new tokens as a reward, leaving the value to be determined entirely by supply and demand.\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin whitepaper, miners will still be motivated to verify transactions and keep the network safe as they will still receive transaction fees after verifying a block.\n\nSome believe that Bitcoin will be worth more once it hits its maximum supply and therefore the amount of fees received for each block of transactions will also increase. However, it is also possible that Bitcoin mining could become unprofitable in the absence of block rewards.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that adjustments to the supply cap could be made in the future. This could involve modifying the maximum cap, perhaps doubling it to 42 million, or implementing a redenomination to alter the supply. However, any such changes would require a consensus among the majority of the Bitcoin mining network.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe exploration of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply reveals an interesting aspect of its design and functionality. The steady release of new bitcoins, occurring approximately every 10 minutes through the creation of blocks on the blockchain, is a deliberate and systematic process. The predetermined reduction of bitcoins minted per block by 50% after 210,000 blocks, or about four years, adds an intriguing layer of scarcity to this digital currency.\n\nAs we navigate the world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the intricacies of Bitcoin\u2019s supply mechanism contributes to a comprehensive grasp of its economic model and long-term sustainability.\n\nFAQs"

        "content": "00:00\n\nThere's definitely people who look at Bitcoin as like the currency that's going to be left when society collapses and it looks like Mad Max out there. Now, when you talk to boomers, though, I'm not sure that's going to resonate versus, oh, it's a new digital goal. That's how Larry Fink positions it. How do you talk to them about this? Do you go as far as like, hey, this is a hedge against like the collapse of society? Or are you more just like, hey, look, it's a little hot sauce. It's an interesting currency. A lot of smart people are involved. Like, how do you talk about it? Yeah, I think two things can be true here, right? I do view it in its most simplistic form as digital gold, as a digital store of value. Now, granted, store value and the price action of Bitcoin might not go hand in hand. But also, you know, the room for alternative investments in a portfolio. I think clients are always seeking for things that aren't correlated or have the ability to produce alpha, you know, to a degree. These are things that clients will always have some appetite for. So these two things like, Hey, new asset class, can I, you know, partake in this? Maybe not the FOMO out of the system? And will this actually add value to my long term investment strategy?"
