        "content": "Texan Activists To Bitcoin Miners: Don\u2019t Mess with Texas\u2019 Water and Electricity\n\nIn a resounding call to action, activists, environmentalists, and concerned Texans have come together for a week-long campaign aimed at challenging the environmental repercussions of the world's largest Bitcoin mining operation. This unified effort seeks to address the consequences of Bitcoin mining in the Lone Star State while advocating for transparency and accountability in the industry and by local politicians.\n\nCorsicana, TX (October 27, 2023) \u2014 In a dynamic week of action, Greenpeace USA, the Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining, and Navarro County residents confronted Riot Platforms Bitcoin mining operations in Texas. The week of action shed light on Riot Platform\u2019s impending launch of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining operation in Corsicana, Texas. This development threatens to exacerbate Texas\u2019 already burdened energy grid and poses substantial environmental risks.\n\nJackie Sawicky, Founder of the Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining, said: \u201cBitcoin proof-of-waste \u2018miners\u2019 are wasting water, driving up our electricity bills, getting tax breaks, abatements, and deeply discounted energy. They get paid to shut down once the grid has destabilized, then they resell that cheap energy at a premium. Why on earth should every Texan pick up the tab for a digital casino that hardly any of us gamble in?\u201d\n\nRiot Platforms\u2019 choice of Corsicana, Texas, as the site for their colossal Bitcoin mine is driven by several factors, including proximity to the Navarro switch, privileged access to already strained water sources, lenient regulations, cost-effective electricity, and enticing incentives offered by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) through its Demand and Reserve Response programs. Through its participation in Demand Response, Riot is able to sell its deeply discounted energy back to Texans at a premium in times when electricity demand is high. This offers Riot substantial financial rewards at the expense of Texas ratepayers. The program has helped turn Texas into a hub for energy-intensive Bitcoin mining operations while Texans are urged to conserve energy and must contend with sky-high electricity bills.\n\nJoshua Archer, Greenpeace USA Bitcoin Campaign Lead said: \u201cWe stand in solidarity with the Texans who are bravely raising their voices against Riot Platforms\u2019 exploitation of their communities. This week of action embodies our collective determination to combat Bitcoin\u2019s destructive impact on electricity grids, water resources, and the global climate.\u201d\n\nThe protest on Wednesday lasted two hours in front of what will be the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mine owned by Riot Platforms. Multiple residents who were driving by engaged with protesters and supported the cause. Photos of the week available here.\n\nKimberlee Walter, Founder of Stand Up for Change: Navarro County said: \u201cThis week of action has provided a crucial platform for raising awareness and informing my fellow Navarro County residents about the absolute devastation the presence of Riot Platforms\u2019 Bitcoin mining operation will have on all of us.\u201d\n\nLocal politicians in Navarro County have been less than transparent about the Bitcoin mining activities in their community, rejecting requests for an official Town Hall meeting to address concerns raised by activists.\n\nThese concerns include:\n\nExcessive electricity consumption on an already stressed and unstable grid;\n\nHigher electricity bills for Texas ratepayers;\n\nExcessive water usage, in drought-prone Texas;\n\nNoise pollution; and\n\nAdditional fossil fuel use at a time when we need rapid progress on emissions reduction.\n\nThe week of action included an unofficial Town Hall meeting on Tuesday hosted by the Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining (TCAC). Speakers included Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston; Adrian Shelley, the Texas office director of Public Citizen; and Jackie Sawicky from TCAC. It was moderated by Kimberlee Walter. Community members, officials from nearby districts, and journalists attended.

        "content": "By James Edwards\n\nThe industry still has some major hurdles to clear before Bitcoin can reach a new all-time-high\n\nThis week Bitcoin rallied to a 17-month high of $35,000 off the back of speculation that a Bitcoin spot ETF is imminent.\n\nInterest in crypto has seemingly done a 180, with institutional investors and retail traders returning to the fold.\n\nBut this euphoria could be short lived, as the industry still has quite a few hurdles to clear before another bull run can take off in earnest.\n\nHere's what you need to know before you jump back into the market.\n\nBinance is on thin ice\n\nSpeak to anyone with their ear to the ground in crypto, and they'll tell you the elephant in the room isn't the Sam Bankman-Fired trial or the SEC, but Binance.\n\nThe world's largest exchange by trade volume is currently facing a crisis on several fronts.\n\nOn October 17, Binance US disabled US dollar withdrawals after the SEC asked a court to freeze the companies assets.\n\nThis action is part of an on-going lawsuit which alleges Binance violated a number of securities laws.\n\nAmong the charges are illegal securities offerings of BNB and BUSD, the comingling of users funds, failure to register as an exchange, and falsifying trading volumes.\n\nThis isn't Binance's only battle in the U.S. either. An earlier lawsuit from the CTFC in March that alleges the company \"willfully evaded\" securities laws and by targeting and onboarding US to its derivatives platform.\n\nBoth lawsuits target not just Binance, but also accuse its CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), of breaking the law.\n\nThe pausing of US dollar withdrawals follows similar actions in Europe and Australia, where EUR and AUD payment partners have abandoned the firm, with no replacements to be found.\n\nJust months before AUD withdrawals were frozen, its Australian CEO Leigh Travers quit the firm as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission investigated Binance and closed its derivatives business by revoking its license.\n\nThings aren't much better across the pond either, with Binance losing its head of UK operations, \u200b\u200bJonathan Farnell, earlier this week.\n\nOn October 16, Binance restricted services for customers in the UK as a result of new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of departures, which saw Binance's Chief Strategy Officer, Senior Director of Investigations, and SVP for Compliance all depart in July.\n\nElsewhere, Binance is facing heat from regulators in Germany for violating securities laws and in both Japan and Singapore for operating without a license.\n\nFor their part, Binance continue to largely dismiss the claims against them, and have filed a request in court to have the SEC lawsuit thrown out.\n\nThe concern now is that Binance could face a liquidity crisis, similar to that of FTX and other defunct exchanges before it.\n\nIf users are forced to withdraw funds en masse, or simply panic, then it's unclear whether Binance would be able to meet demand.\n\nIt's no secret that Binance has built a sprawling web of financial services, which include all sorts of lending facilities, staking, funding deals, and trading activities.\n\nAny sudden capital flight could easily shock the system, and have flow-on effects throughout the industry.\n\nNo one quite knows if Binance is operating with integrity, but the concern is very real.\n\nThe Sam Bankman-Fried trial and FTX bankruptcy are still unresolved\n\nThe criminal trial against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is now in its 4th week, and won't conclude until November 9th at the earliest.\n\nA core line of inquiry has been FTX's sprawling empire and business dealings. These include hundreds of investments in crypto projects, its hedge fund Alameda and even millions of dollars of political donations.\n\nAs further evidence of illegal conduct is revealed, there's concern around what impact this will have on the wider industry \u2013 which is only just recovering.\n\nFor instance, FTX and its sister firm, Alameda, invested $5.3 billion in 473 companies via their venture capital efforts.\n\nOf this, approximately $3.2 billion was invested across 250 different crypto projects in return for tokens, or token IOUs.\n\nThe list includes major names like Polygon (MATIC), Near (NEAR) and Lido (LDO), as well as 200 or so lesser known projects.\n\nAs FTX administrators look to recoup customer assets, it\u2019s possible that these tokens will be sold off in order to reimburse creditors.\n\nThe latest proposal from FTX's administrators looks to settle bankruptcy proceedings and return funds to creditors by July 2023.\n\nSo any major sell-offs should be expected before this date, and could potentially dampen any fuel added to Bitcoin's rocket by an ETF approval.\n\nThis wouldn't just dampen token prices either.\n\nMost projects rely on the value of their token to fund their on-going development. A sudden devaluation of their treasury would place the future of many projects in peril.\n\nA new lawsuit: Gemini, Genesis and Digital Currency Group sued by New York AG\n\nOn October 19, the New York Attorney General, Letita James, filed a lawsuit against Gemini Trust, Genesis Global Capital and Digital Currency Group (DCG).\n\nThe lawsuit revolves around Gemini's Earn programme, with the three companies accused of defrauding more than 230,000 customers of $1.1 billion.\n\nGemini loaned user funds to Genesis, which is owned by DCG. Genesis then lent these to firms such as Alameda (of FTX fame) and Three Arrows Capital, which later collapsed, leaving $1.1 billion of bad debt that Gemini has been blaming Gensis for ever since.\n\nThe suit alleges that all parties \"falsely claimed\" they had the necessary licenses to operate in New York.\n\nGemini has worked hard to position itself as the victim in this case, with its owners, the Winklevoss Twins, accusing DCG owner Barry Silbert publicly via forums like X (twitter).\n\nThe New York AG is seeking to have Gemini, Genesis and DCG banned from operating in New York and is seeking compensation for the 29,000 New Yorkers affected \u2013 approximately 12.5% of the total users.\n\nIf forced to repay this portion of the $1.1 billion owed, DCG may be forced to sell off part of its portfolio of companies.\n\nThese include wholly owned entities like Grayscale Investments, CoinDesk and the Luno exchange. Then there is equity in another 200+ crypto related companies of all shapes and sizes, many of which play critical roles in the wider crypto economy.\n\nIn February this year, there were reports that DCG was forced to sell parts of its portfolio at a steep discount, in order to help fund the hole left by Genesis.\n\nWhile DCG has since sought bankruptcy for Gensis to try and stem the bleeding, the new suite by the NY AG may force DCG to sell off even more of its portfolio and disrupt markets further.\n\nStill a while to go\n\nDespite the excitement around a spot crypto ETF potentially being approved soon in the U.S., cryptocurrency markets still have a lot of skeletons in the closet and hurdles that need to be cleared before the next bull market can take off.\n\nInvestors will want to be wary of unbridled euphoria this time around, and make sure to analyze the bigger picture before going all in on one of the most volatile asset classes in history.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin: Buy the Dip? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the first half of 2023, the surprising turnaround for Bitcoin (BTC -3.18%) was the talk of the crypto industry. Bitcoin skyrocketed right out of the gate, and by mid-July, had nearly doubled in price to $32,000. However, since then, Bitcoin's fortunes have cooled considerably. Bitcoin is trading around $28,000 as of this writing, a nearly 15% haircut from its intra-year high.\n\nSo is now the time to buy the dip on Bitcoin? After all, according to the Bitcoin bulls, the world's most popular cryptocurrency is simply taking a breather before once again marching higher. Are they right or wrong?\n\nChanging investor perceptions\n\nIf you are a long-term crypto investor, the good news is that the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains largely unchanged. Bitcoin adoption rates worldwide continue to grow, Bitcoin still accounts for nearly 50% of the market cap of the entire crypto industry, and Bitcoin is still the crypto of choice for institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe bad news, though, is that investor perceptions about Bitcoin have changed. For institutional investors, the macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. economy has been front and center, and with so much uncertainty surrounding monetary policy and the future path of interest rates, it's perhaps only natural that Bitcoin has stalled out around the $30,000 level. The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that risk assets (such as cryptocurrencies) do not perform well in high-interest-rate environments, so the Federal Reserve has emerged as a crucial factor in how investors view Bitcoin.\n\nAt one time, Bitcoin was largely uncorrelated with broader U.S. financial markets, and investors viewed Bitcoin as providing similar hedging benefits as gold. But that viewpoint has been steadily changing. Based on changing correlations between different asset classes, it now appears that Bitcoin is trading much more like a big tech stock. The important point here is that Bitcoin's correlation with other asset classes changes over time, and that influences how investors view Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional money and Bitcoin\n\nIf there's one factor that can decisively move Bitcoin higher in the near and medium terms, it's the flow of new institutional money into Bitcoin. At one time, institutional investors wouldn't touch Bitcoin with a 10-foot pole. But, oh, how times have changed. The first big break came in August 2022, when BlackRock entered into a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global to enable institutional access to crypto assets.\n\nSince then, the floodgates have opened. One development that has captured the attention of investors this year is the upcoming introduction of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market. The process started this summer, when BlackRock announced plans for a spot Bitcoin ETF. After that, other high-profile institutional investors -- including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest -- jumped in with spot Bitcoin ETF applications of their own. Once one of these applications is approved, it could lead to a huge new inflow of institutional money into Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nIn April, Bitcoin will experience another \"halving\" event, in which the reward paid out to cryptocurrency miners for mining a new block of Bitcoin is cut by one-half. In three previous halving cycles (2012, 2016, and 2020), the price of Bitcoin has soared, and many Bitcoin analysts are expecting the same to happen in 2024. While past performance is no guarantee of future performance, it certainly hints at Bitcoin's long-term price potential.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank, for example, is predicting a price of $100,000 for Bitcoin by the end of 2024. And Pantera Capital, a crypto hedge fund, has set a price target of $149,000 for Bitcoin.\n\nThe theory is that the halving, by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created in the future, will introduce a scarcity effect. As long as demand remains constant or increases, the price of Bitcoin should increase.\n\nDollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin\n\nBased on the above, I'm bullish on Bitcoin's future prospects. From my perspective, the only thing that has changed is investor perceptions about Bitcoin. As a result, now could be the perfect time to start dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin. By buying the same amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., once per month), you would limit (but not eliminate) downside risk while also getting access to Bitcoin's enormous upside potential.\n\nIf you are expecting Bitcoin to regain its momentum heading into 2024, then dollar-cost averaging could be an effective strategy to accumulate Bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Worth $4.5 Billion Set To Expire Today\n\nThe crypto options market is facing a major event today that could lead to increased volatility and shifting prices for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAccording to data from Deribit, over $4.5 billion worth of options contracts in Bitcoin and Ethereum are set to expire at 8:00 UTC on Friday, October 27.\n\nOptions give buyers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific expiration date. As these options reach their expiration date, holders will have to decide whether to exercise their contracts or let them expire worthless.\n\nThis could lead to a spike in trading volume and volatility around the expiration time as market participants react to whether large options positions are exercised or not. CoinDesk reported the current open interest in contract terms has increased to $20.64, significantly higher than in November 2021 when BTC was around $66,000.\n\nThe impending options expiration comes after a period of positive price movement for top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin rose from around $26,000 to over $34,000 in recent weeks. This market activity led to increased options trading.\n\nTraders and investors will be closely watching the impact of this historic options expiration as it unfolds today. The $4.5 billion in contracts set to expire represents the scale of the crypto options market today, and how it can drive price action and volatility in underlying assets."

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving is Soon \u2014 Is Now the Best Time to Invest? - Entrepreneur",
        "content": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nLess than a year is left before the Bitcoin halving \u2014 an event when the reward for mining a Bitcoin block will be cut in half. Historically, the halving has been followed by a major bull run in the crypto market. Should we expect the crypto summer soon \u2014 and what other factors may push the Bitcoin price up?\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Is Back, Apparently. Here's What's Fueling the Surge.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin supply is limited. No more than 21 million coins will ever exist, and the new ones are only issued to reward miners for running the network. Currently, the size of this reward is 6.25 coins per block \u2014 and every four years, it is reduced by half. The 2024 halving, expected in April, will lower the reward to 3.125 BTC.\n\nBitcoin was designed to be scarce: its limited supply protects it from inflation. With the growing demand for the asset, its price must steadily grow \u2014 which is exactly what's happening with Bitcoin over the years.\n\nRelated: Why the Next Crypto Bull Run Will Be Like Nothing We've Ever Experienced\n\nThree halvings, three rallies\n\nHistorically, the halving has been followed by a bull run, and Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs within 1\u20131.5 years after the event. Bitcoin gained 30X following its 2016 halving and 6.5X after the one in 2020. More importantly, the Bitcoin halving makes the entire market soar: in 2020\u20132021, hundreds of altcoins surged by 1,000%+.\n\nShould we expect the same from the next halving?\n\nWill Bitcoin halving trigger a new rally?\n\nPantera Capital, the world's largest crypto hedge fund, argues that Bitcoin will grow to $148,000 in the new market cycle. The firm emphasizes: \"Bitcoin has historically bottomed 477 days prior to the halving, climbed leading into it, and then exploded to the upside afterward.\" This means that the latest bottom should have been hit in late 2022. If we look at the BTC price chart, we do see the local minimum of $15,490 in November. Bitcoin has historically reached the new ATH within 480 days after the halving.\n\nOther analysts agree that we've already passed the lows of the current cycle. By December 2022, 65% of the pre-halving period was over \u2014 the mark usually followed by a few months of a sideways price movement, which eventually ended up in growth.\n\nBitcoin did recover from the local minimum \u2013 but failed to keep above $30K this August.\n\nSome forecasts are, however, more restrained. For instance, MacroMicro, an analytical platform that consolidates global economic data, emphasizes the role of macroeconomic factors that may impact the prospective Bitcoin rally.\n\nThree latest post-halving bull runs coincided with a substantial increase in money supply by the USA, EU, China and Japan central banks. In contrast, these financial authorities have been doing the opposite during the last year \u2014 rising rates to tackle inflation. The chances that they'll ease the liquidity in the following months seem low.\n\nThe more the money supply grows, the greater BTC price increases.\n\nRelated: Tesla Reports $170 Million Loss in Failed Bitcoin Investment\n\nWhat else can pump Bitcoin?\n\nOne more factor favoring the Bitcoin price might be the approval of Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds).\n\nAn ETF is a fund that holds a portfolio of certain assets, and its shares are traded on an exchange. The owner of an ETF invests in the fund's portfolio by purchasing a share of it rather than buying the assets themselves.\n\nIn the case of a Bitcoin ETF, the fund owns Bitcoin, and investors can purchase the shares of this fund on an exchange. The value of these shares is tied to the Bitcoin price. For institutional investors, it is easy to embrace the first cryptocurrency \u2014 ETFs don't require buying and trading Bitcoin itself, which lets them avoid legal risks. For retail investors, ETFs are an opportunity to quickly diversify their portfolio with cryptocurrency without buying it directly.\n\nBitcoin ETFs are currently allowed in Canada and some other countries. While the USA is considered potentially the largest market for this kind of asset, the SEC has not approved any Bitcoin ETFs in America yet. But if it does, the first cryptocurrency may experience a large spike in trading volume \u2014 and, consequently, price.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways to Maintain and Expand Your Wealth During the Cryptocurrency Dip\n\nHow should I prepare for the bull run?\n\nSooner or later, the market will enter the growth phase of the cycle. Led by Bitcoin, it will also make other coins grow by 100%, 500%, and even 1,000% or more.\n\nThis is where picking the right coins to invest in is key. A sure way is doing your research and building up a balanced portfolio \u2014 when the market skyrockets, the chance of making gains is high, irrespective of what particular assets are included.\n\nAnother way is to leverage the portfolio composed by professional cryptocurrency researchers using AI tools trained to find the most promising coins. Those portfolios are publicly available as index tokens representing the combined value of multiple coins from different domains of the crypto market.\n\nSome of the index tokens are focused on halving \u2014 their purpose is to identify the coins that may demonstrate the most impressive growth in the next bull run. For instance, Bitdriven is an index token representing the value of Bitcoin, Top-10 crypto coins by market cap and many other altcoins from Web3, DeFi and other segments that promise to make gains from 10X to 15X after April 2024.\n\nThe data from different years demonstrates that Bitcoin gains less and less value in terms of Xs after each bull run. Whether you leverage index tokens or not, picking the right altcoins will be the key to making your best returns in 2024."

        "content": "It\u2019s not a matter of if, but when.\n\nI\u2019m talking, of course, about the long-awaited approval of a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence now estimate there\u2019s a 90% chance that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will give the go-ahead to such an investment product by January 10, 2024.\n\nMany presenters at this week\u2019s European Blockchain Convention (EBC) were even more optimistic, saying they believe a Bitcoin ETF will appear on the market by the end of this year.\n\nMr. Market appears to agree. Responding to strong speculation that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment management firm, is preparing to \u201cseed\u201d its iShares Bitcoin ETF this month with an unknown amount of capital in anticipation of its imminent approval, investors bid up the price of the digital asset this week to more than $35,000, a price we haven\u2019t seen in nearly a year and a half. That\u2019s roughly double what Bitcoin started the year at. For comparison\u2019s sake, Ether, the second largest digital token by market cap, is up around 50% year-to-date.\n\nInvestors Seeking Direct Access to Bitcoin\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are already available to certain investors. Canada has had them for years. Europe launched its first one in August. But even when combined, Canada and Europe are dwarfed by the size of the U.S. stock market, which accounts for close to 60% of the total global equity market value. Of the top 10 largest investment management firms, only two\u2014France\u2019s Credit Agricole and Germany\u2019s Allianz\u2014are non-American.\n\nTo date, the only way for U.S. investors to get exposure to Bitcoin\u2014besides buying the asset outright\u2014is through futures, options and other derivatives. The largest of these products, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has been trading publicly since 2015 and currently has over $21 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nBut trusts are unwieldy products compared to ETFs, which are traded on exchanges throughout the day and can be highly liquid.\n\nPlus, investors want access to spot Bitcoin prices, just as they have access to spot gold prices with physical gold-backed ETFs.\n\nGrayscale knows all of this, of course, which is why it\u2019s filed to convert GBTC to an ETF. And now, like BlackRock and a number of other firms that have also submitted applications for a Bitcoin ETF\u2014they include Fidelity, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, VanEck and WisdomTree\u2014Grayscale must play the waiting game at a time when many market experts are concerned that the U.S. could be falling behind other jurisdictions when it comes to Bitcoin investment, not to mention regulation.\n\nSome firms are choosing to act now. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest, which also has a Bitcoin ETF in the pipeline, has begun selling shares of GBTC in anticipation of its successful conversion into an ETF.\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of a U.S. Spot ETF\n\nSo what are the implications?\n\nAssuming for the moment that the SEC is in fact ready to give its blessing to a BlackRock-issued Bitcoin ETF, it\u2019s possible we may never see the token below $30,000 again. In such a scenario, the New York-based investment firm would likely become the world\u2019s largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, creating a potential supply crunch. Remember, Bitcoin production is capped at 21 million, and the \u201chalving\u201d\u2014when the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half\u2014is coming up in around six months.\n\nThe availability of a Bitcoin ETF would also finally herald the arrival of institutional investors. For many financial advisors, fiduciaries and others, Bitcoin is not an approved wealth management strategy. A spot ETF, on the other hand, would be.\n\nAccording to estimates made by blockchain and digital asset company Galaxy, a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETF would attract $14 billion in investor inflows in the first year alone. This would accelerate to $27 billion in the second year and, at the end of the third year following its launch, nearly $40 billion.\n\nThis is only an estimate, and no one can predict the future with absolute certainty. But for speculators, accumulating Bitcoin now\u2014before an ETF hits the U.S. market\u2014may end up being a very profitable decision.\n\nCertainty in an Uncertain World\n\nI\u2019m pleased to report that enthusiasm was very high at the ECB, held in beautiful Barcelona. It was the most well-attended event in the conference\u2019s history, with some 5,000 people in attendance\u2014double the turnout from earlier this year.\n\nDespite it being a blockchain/Web3/DeFi conference, Bitcoin was the $35,000 gorilla in the room. As a number of presenters said, the asset offers certainty in a highly uncertain world. This tracks with my recent comments that Bitcoin represents private property rights and, more broader, human rights.\n\nWith a spot ETF looking more and more likely, now could be an unprecedented opportunity to get exposure. Remember, however, to do your own due diligence and keep in mind that volatility is much greater than what you find in traditional investment instruments. For that reason, I recommend a weighting of no more than 2% of your total portfolio.\n\nIndex Summary\n\nThe major market indices finished down this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.14%. The S&P 500 Stock Index fell 2.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.62%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index lost2.76% this week.\n\nThe Hang Seng Composite gained 1.49% this week; while Taiwan was down 1.86% and the KOSPI fell 3.04%.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 7 basis points to 4.837%.\n\nAirlines and Shipping\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing airline stock for the week was SkyWest, up 13.1%. SkyWest reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.55, better than Visible Alpha\u2019s consensus of $0.39. The beat versus consensus was driven by better-than-expected revenue. The company introduced fourth quarter block hour production guidance of flat-to-down slightly sequentially or up 2% year-over-year. This implies fiscal year 2023 block hours down 9% year-over-year, ahead of prior expectations of down 11%.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, air cargo freight rates bottomed in early September and have sequentially moved higher, sustaining at 30%-35% above 2019 levels in the past month. The bank attributes the uptick to demand seasonality around the end-of-year peak as well as the imposition of fuel surcharges given rapid moves higher in jet fuel in the third quarter.\n\nIAG reported third quarter operating profit before the exceptional items of \u20ac1,745 million, 12% ahead of company consensus, which had been revised up following first half of the year results. The beat relative to consensus was driven by lower non-fuel unit costs (-3.5%) and better yields (up 2% year-over-year).\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing airline stock for the week was Frontier, down 10.5%. Hawaiian Air reported an adjusted loss per share of ($1.06), worse than FactSet\u2019s consensus of ($0.94). The miss versus consensus was driven by worse revenue and non-operating costs. Near-term revenue trends are being pressured by the negative impact of the Maui wildfires and accelerating industry capacity growth to Japan where demand is still recovering, while near-term unit cost growth is higher-than-expected due to an elevated number of aircraft on the ground.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, weekly container spot rates confirm a downtrend while quarterly results from overseas firms also reveal guidance cuts and anticipated container losses. Consensus forecasts have not sufficiently factored in prospects of a net loss at Ocean Network Express (ONE), but expectations are falling.\n\nVolaris reported another challenging quarter, missing Bloomberg consensus estimates on the operating and bottom-line levels. The top line was at $848 million (up 10% year-over-year), nearly in line with consensus. Net income came in at -$39 million, below the Street at $2 million.\n\nOpportunities\n\nAccording to UBS, the latest UBS Evidence Lab Global Travel Manager Survey sheds light on expected business behavior in 2024 and beyond and still suggests business traffic recovery. Most travel managers see budget increases next year with on-average travel budgets expected to increase by 10% year-over-year and most expect a full recovery of travel budgets back to 2019 in the next two years.\n\nAccording to Stifel, over the course of the past 30 years, after adjusting for inflation and operating costs, the cash-on-cash return of a one-year time charter contract relative to the price of a new ship was 10% for a VLCC and 11% for a Capesize vessel. Currently, newbuild prices are 23% higher than the 20-year average for VLCCs and 26% higher for Capesize vessels. For a scrubber fitted VLCC and Newcastlemax (slightly larger modern version of a Capesize) the adjusted returns are 11.5% and 6.5%. This implies fewer ships will be added in the future.\n\nMedia is reporting that in response to increased fuel prices, Qantas is increasing fares by an average of 3.5%. Qantas Group had absorbed recent fuel hikes but according to a company spokesman, the current tensions in the Middle East, broader economic factors and a weaker Australian dollar means that fuel prices are expected to stay elevated for some time. Even after the adjustment, the fares are expected to remain below the peaks of last year.\n\nThreats\n\nMorgan Stanley believes there is a mounting risk of weakening pricing in long haul markets such as the Atlantic and Europe-Middle East Africa next year, with capacity scheduled to accelerate materially in these markets through winter.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, air cargo supply continues to grow around 10% year-over-year with surging belly capacity on international flight restoration and limited supply discipline from freighters for now. The bank sees more pressure ahead from further restoration of passenger flights in the upcoming winter 2023-2024 season, while freighter supply discipline could remain elusive until rates turn loss-making, particularly with new freighters getting delivered.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, Spirit Airlines had the highest percentage of cancelations occurring over the past week at 4.5% of scheduled flights (compared to 0.1% the prior week). Spirit saw a jump in cancelations due to \u201ca necessary inspection of a small section of 25 of our aircraft,\u201d which will be out of service for several days. The airline noted the inspection was due to an abundance of caution and expects the network will take several days to recover.\n\nLuxury Goods and International Markets\n\nStrengths\n\nHermes reported a revenue increase of 16% in the third quarter. Sales in the United States and Europe were strong due to high demand for the costly Birkin and Kelly handbags. Growth in America topped estimates, while the performance in Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, was in line, reports Bloomberg.\n\nThe U.S. continues to report solid economic data. The Manufacturing PMI and Service PMI came in stronger than expected. The Preliminary Manufacturing PMI for October was reported at 50 versus the expected 49.5. The Service PMI climbed to 50.9, above the expected 49.9. Annualized GDP for the third quarter was released at 4.9%, above the expected 4.5%.\n\nDeckers, a footwear designer and distributor, was the best performing S&P Global Luxury stock, gaining 15.7% in the past five days. Shares gained almost 20% on Friday after the company reported strong quarterly sales. Deckers reported $6.82 earnings per share in the quarter, compared with $3.80 a share, in the same period a year ago.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAll Kering brands reported a revenue drop in the third quarter except eyewear. The company\u2019s biggest brand, Gucci, reported a 7% decline in revenue, below the expected drop of 6.21%. Sales at Yves Saint Laurent slid 12% last quarter and sales at Balenciaga fell 15%, both missing estimates. The group sales declined 9%, missing estimates.\n\nThe preliminary Eurozone Manufacturing PMI for October was reported at 43.0, below the expected reading of 43.7, and September\u2019s 43.4. In the past 20 years, Manufacturing PMI dipped to the low 30 level twice: in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2008 due to the global recession.\n\nSleep Number, a U.S. mattress maker and wellness technology leader, was the worst performing S&P Global Luxury stock, losing 17.5% in the past five days. On Friday, shares closed at a 52-week low on a light news flow. The prior week, Sleep Number was the best performing name among the luxury index members.\n\nOpportunities\n\nBank of America\u2019s luxury research team recommends selecting names within luxury sectors that are exposed to more affluent customer bases like Louis Vuitton, Hermes, Cucinelli, and Zegna. The super-rich are less affected by the economic downturn and will most likely continue to spend their wealth on luxury goods and services.\n\nChina announced measures to support its economy this week. The government approved CNY 1 trillion ($139.3 billion) in additional government bond issuance for disaster relief and reparations. Proceeds are to be transferred to local governments with half to be used this year. In addition, China lifted its 2023 budget deficit to around 3.8% of gross domestic product from an originally set 3%. Economists expect rate cuts to follow.\n\nAccording to a report released by global consultancy firm Kearny and beauty e-commerce platform Luxasia, South Asia and India are poised to be the next \u201cgold rush\u201d markets for luxury beauty. The report estimated that the two regions together will increase in size from $4.5 billion in 2021 to $12.7 billion in 2031, growing at a CAGR (cumulative annual growth rate) of 11%, compared to the estimated global luxury beauty industry growth rate of 4-6%.\n\nThreats\n\nAccording to Bank of America, in the United States, luxury spending relative to 2019 has peaked in the first quarter of 2022. The chart below shows seven quarters of acceleration in card spending, and so far, six quarters of corrections. BofA predicts luxury revenue growth to trough in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe European Central Bank is determined to bring inflation lower to its target of 2%, but this week the bank has decided to keep rates on hold after 10 consecutive hikes. The pause follows a slowdown in euro-are prices, but concerns are mounting that a recession could be coming to the region. If the Israel-Hams conflict worsens, this could result in higher energy prices.\n\nChris Watling, chief executive of financial advisory firm Longview Economics, warned that consumers are quickly running out of excess cash, while household savings are coming under pressure. Many strategists, asset managers, and CEOs remain concerned about the longer-term economic outlook, worrying about the United States falling into recession.\n\nEnergy and Natural Resources\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing commodity for the week was natural gas, rising 9.14%, partly on short covering prior to contract expiring at the end of the week and a slightly colder weather forecast. Chevron Corp. said it will no longer use put options to hedge the crude oil production it is acquiring from Hess Corp. once the deal is complete. Hess is one of a handful of major U.S. oil players that still participates in the options market to guarantee a minimum price for its barrels. In its most recent earnings report, published in July, the company had contracts in place that locked in $70 a barrel for about 80,000 barrels a day of WTI production, and $75 for about 50,000 barrels of Brent production for the rest of this year.\n\nAccording to RBC, uranium spot prices rebounded back near recent highs as activity picked up during the week, with a pick-up in financial/company buying and utility interest. On the news front, Euratom released its 2022 Annual Supply report which highlighted a projected moderate increase in uranium requirements and a decrease in inventories, while uranium requirements in the EU are generally covered by contracts through 2025.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) authorized transactions in Venezuela\u2019s oil and gas sector including production, lifting, sale and exportation of oil and gas (including provision of related services and payment of invoices). The licenses authorizing such transactions are valid through April 2024. The authorizations follow agreements between the government and the opposition to hold free elections on the second half of 2024. The licenses will be renewed only if Venezuela meets its commitments under the electoral roadmap as well as other commitments with respect to those who are wrongfully detained.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing commodity for the week was crude oil, dropping 3.33%, likely in response to dropping oil sanctions on Venezuela. Oil also fell amid signs Israel is rethinking the scope of a potential invasion of Gaza, at least temporarily containing the conflict in the Middle East. West Texas Intermediate fell below $86 a barrel in a volatile session that saw prices swing in a more than $2 range. Israel appeared to hold off on its widely expected ground offensive into the Gaza Strip to buy time for the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nA federal judge has rejected an argument by 34 coal-fired power plant owners and operators that they were not aware of five patents for a mercury-removal process before Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. sued alleging infringement. Midwest says the defendants are liable for induced and contributory infringement of certain method claims of the asserted patents by manufacturing and selling refined coal to non-party power plants.\n\nAccording to UBS, steel prices in Europe have continued to fall in October, with steel prices down \u20ac15/ton to \u20ac645/ton in Germany (the lowest level since 2020). Confidence in EU demand strength remains low and ordering activity at domestic mills subdued, in part due to the arrival of large volumes of imported steel.\n\nOpportunities\n\nChina is planning to boost its strategic stockpiles of cobalt, according to people familiar with the matter, just three months after the government last bought the metal used in everything from electric-vehicle batteries to aerospace alloys. The National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, which manages the state\u2019s commodity stockpiles, has agreed to buy about 3,000 tons of cobalt, said the people, who are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nChina is planning to boost its strategic stockpiles of cobalt, according to people familiar with the matter, just three months after the government last bought the metal used in everything from electric-vehicle batteries to aerospace alloys. The National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, which manages the state\u2019s commodity stockpiles, has agreed to buy about 3,000 tons of cobalt, said the people, who are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nSQM increased its bid for Azure Minerals to $3.52, ~A$1.6Bn, up 46% from its previous bid of $2.41. Azure stock was ~$1.70 prior to the original SQM bid in July. The current bid = +100% premium, where Azure was trading prior to the original approach. However, that bid may face some headwinds as Gina Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting has acquired 18% of Azure. SQM can pull out of the proposed transaction if another shareholder acquires more than 19%. Albermale Corp. was trying to buy Liontown Resources Ltd. but Rinehart blocked that transaction too.\n\nThreats\n\nCopper has gone from jump to slump this year as enthusiasm about China\u2019s reopening gave way to concerns over demand, ballooning stockpiles, and pricing patterns that speak to abundant, near-term supply. Benchmark three-month futures on the LME just sank to the lowest since last November and, absent a run of micro-evidence suggesting conditions are bottoming out, the bias will remain for further weakness into the year-end. At present, cash metal trades well below futures, known as contango.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, steel global output came in below its five-year average as production declined in China (-6% year-over-year), while it rose sequentially on day-adjusted basis due to Europe and Iran. Morgan Stanley sees further downside to production run-rates, largely driven by China\u2019s seasonal slowdown and Europe\u2019s accelerating capacity cuts.\n\nRussia\u2019s oil flows are climbing steadily as Moscow\u2019s adherence to a pact with Saudi Arabia to keep barrels off the global market shows signs of waning. About 3.53 million barrels a day of crude was shipped from Russian ports in the week to October 22, an increase of 20,000 barrels a day from the previous seven days, tanker-tracking data monitored by Bloomberg show. That lifted the less volatile four-week average to 3.5 million barrels a day, the highest since June, and up by about 610,000 barrels a day in the past two months.\n\nBitcoin and Digital Assets\n\nStrengths\n\nOf the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was FLOKI, rising 84.97%.\n\nBitcoin surged above $31,000 for the first time since July as a U.S. federal appeals court made final a ruling that effectively clears the way for the issuance of an exchange traded fund (ETF) that invests directly in the cryptocurrency, writes Bloomberg.\n\nDeclining national fiat currencies and a generally unstable economy have helped propel Bitcoin to all-time high prices in Turkey and Nigeria, despite the asset trading 50% below its peak in U.S. dollar terms. Recent price surges have caused Bitcoin to cross price peaks against the Turkish lira and Nigerian naira, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOf the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was Bitcoin SV, down 13.40%.\n\nBitcoin faces a reality check if ETFs spark a \u2018sell-the-new\u2019 pivot. Chart patterns hint that the Bitcoin rally has become stretched, and the founder of Venn Link Partners expects short-term selling if U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, writes Bloomberg.\n\nBitcoiners might be excited, but Grayscale\u2019s proposal to turn its Bitcoin trust into an ETF still needs a green light from the SEC, and that is not a sure thing. SEC Chair Gary Gensler could still find a second reason to deny the proposal after choosing not to appeal a court ruling striking down his first one, writes Bloomberg.\n\nOpportunities\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s digital token, JPM Coin, now handles $1 billion worth of transactions daily and the bank plans to continue widening its usage. JPM Coin enables wholesale clients to make dollar and euro-denominated payments through a private blockchain network, according to Bloomberg.\n\nShares of Coinbase may move 9% higher after the company reports earnings, according to options data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTaiwan has officially proposed a draft crypto act for the first reading. The proposal to regulate crypto assets passed the first reading at the Legislative Yuan. It would require all crypto platforms operating in Taiwan to apply for a permit, writes Bloomberg.\n\nThreats\n\nSam Bankman-Fried will take the stand to defend his actions in the lead-up to the collapse of his digital asset empire. This comes after taking a beating from former colleagues who described him as the mastermind of a years long scheme to defraud FTX customers and investors, writes Bloomberg.\n\nBinance is experiencing technical issues with crypto withdrawals, it said in a post on X and withdrawals will be temporarily unavailable, writes Bloomberg.\n\nCrypto platform Gemini Trust is suing bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global Holdco LLC in an attempt to determine who rightfully owns a slug of shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, now worth nearly $1.6 billion, writes Bloomberg.\n\nGold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed at $2,016.20, up $21.80 per ounce, or 1.09%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week lower by 1.27%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in off just 0.04%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.37%.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing precious metal for the week was palladium, up 1.78%. U.S. stocks are in their third monthly decline while underwhelming corporate earnings and yields climbing above 5% have investors pondering their choices. When other assets don\u2019t look so safe, gold may find a more welcome buyer. As of Friday afternoon, gold is up more than 10% year-to-date and the S&P 500 is now up only 7%. Russia saw gold production drop 9.2% year-on-year and 4.1% month-on-month in September 2023, the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) said in a statement. Despite the declining monthly data, the overall volume of domestic gold production rose 1.7% for the first nine months of this year.\n\nEldorado Gold reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.17, well above consensus of $0.04, partially driven by better-than-expected costs across the portfolio. Third quarter production of 121,000 ounces gold was pre-released, with higher quarter-over-quarter production, while consolidated AISC of $1,177 per ounce was 21% below consensus AISC of $1,486 per ounce.\n\nAlamos reported third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.14, above the consensus of $0.12. Production of 135,400 ounces at total cash costs of $835 per ounce and AISC (all-in sustaining costs) of $1,121 per ounce beat consensus by 12%, 4%, and 7% respectively, driven by continued outperformance at Mulatos. The company has increased its fiscal year 2023 production guidance from 480-520,000 ounces gold to 515-530,000 ounces gold and reiterated its cost guidance with AISC of $1,125-$1,175 per ounce.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing precious metal for the week was silver, down 1.34%. According to Morgan Stanley, gold ETF holdings are now at the lowest level since early 2020 with nearly continuous outflows since April 2022. This shows the challenge of gold as an investment when bond yields are rising, as it struggles to compete in portfolios as a non-yielding asset.\n\nGold edged lower as benchmark Treasury yields hit the highest since 2007 while fears of a spiraling conflict in the Middle East receded. The yield on 10-year U.S. bonds topped 5% on Monday for the first time in 16 years, driven by expectations the Federal Reserve will keep monetary policy tight for a long period. That is typically negative for bullion, which bears no interest.\n\nOceanaGold reported third quarter production of 99.0 k ounces gold, below the 104.1 k ounce consensus and AISC of $1,911 per ounce gold above the $1,757 per ounce consensus. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.00, missing the consensus estimate of $0.03. Concurrently, OceanaGold updated its fiscal year 2023 cost guidance, increasing forecasted cash cost by $50 per ounce to a range of $850 \u2013 $950 per ounce, while AISC by $125 per ounce to a range of $1,550 \u2013 $1,650 per ounce, reflecting the impact of lower production from Haile.\n\nOpportunities\n\nGold priced in Swiss francs shows that the precious metal could sustain its upward momentum should geopolitical tensions persist. The Swiss franc and gold have seen a surge in demand as haven assets amid the turmoil in the Middle East. Gold has gained more than 8% against the dollar so far in 2023, while the Swiss franc has appreciated by more than 3%, solidifying its position as the leading performer among G-10 currencies.\n\nAccording to recent data from the U.S. Treasury, Chinese investors sold $21.2 billion of U.S. assets in the month of August. Chinese investors may be among the first to direct their funds to gold markets. There are two main theories about the reasons of China\u2019s rapid selling of U.S. assets. First, the Asian nation needs to support the local currency. The second potential reason for China\u2019s activity lies in the realm of geopolitics.\n\nWheaton Precious Metals has entered into a definitive Precious Metal Purchase Agreement with Waterton Copper Corp. on its 100% owned Mineral Park Mine located in Arizona, USA. Wheaton will pay Waterton total upfront cash consideration of $115M in four payments during construction (three installments of $25M and a final installment of $40M) with construction to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Under the stream, Wheaton will purchase 100% of the payable silver from the project for the life of the mine.\n\nThreats\n\nBitcoin continues to gain ground, taking bullish cues from traditional rate-sensitive assets like gold. Prices are up 14% for the month, with gold registering a much lesser 6.7% gain. Gold, however, picked up a bid a week before Bitcoin, as the outbreak of tensions between Israel and Hamas, alongside continued speculation about the end of the Fed tightening cycle, signaled an inflationary regime ahead.\n\nPanama\u2019s labor unrest surrounding First Quantum\u2019s new contract to operate its copper and gold mine is still facing challenges. Protests have broken out and now Panama\u2019s Supreme Court noted it will consider a lawsuit which alleges the nation\u2019s contract violates their constitution. Frano-Nevada Corp. has the most exposure to First Quantum through its royalty on the gold production. Regardless of the outcome, Panama makes itself look unsuitable for new mining investment currently.\n\nSibanye Stillwater Ltd. said it will enter talks with labor unions over the possible restructuring at some of its South African platinum group mines that could affect more than 4,000 workers. The consultations will concern four shafts \u2013 two of which have reached the end of their producing lives \u2013 at the company\u2019s Rustenburg, Marikana and Kroondal projects, the Johannesburg- based firm said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).

        "title": "CryptoFinance: Cultures clash as bitcoin ETF turns rebellion into money - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter.\n\n\u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009: Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nIn the early days of 2009, bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto etched that headline into the first batch of bitcoin transactions ever processed.\n\nThe message was a nod to bitcoin\u2019s intended purpose, as laid down in the initial white paper: a form of electronic cash that offered people the chance to separate their financial lives from the control of powerful intermediaries such as banks, regulators or the government.\n\nCrypto\u2019s confident, scornful and punky start came to mind this week for some when bitcoin surged to roughly $35,000. It was a small but meaningful moment: all those losses sustained after the Terra stablecoin collapsed and sent a whole heap of trouble pulsing through the market were erased.\n\nBut what triggered the gains was, well, nothing very much.\n\nThe market is on tenterhooks so much because BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, may soon receive regulatory approval in the US to launch a cash bitcoin exchange traded fund, something that invests directly in bitcoin and can be traded as easily on the New York Stock Exchange as Apple.\n\nBut this has been the case for months and the approvals may not come until next year. What seemed to have got bitcoin enthusiasts excited was BlackRock\u2019s ETF added to a list of eligible assets that are held at the US securities clearing house.\n\nThis is the equivalent of a harried waiter in a crowded restaurant clearing a table, before ushering you over; a necessary step but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to eat imminently.\n\nNor was the spike an isolated incident. Last week bitcoin leapt 8 per cent on a false rumour that BlackRock had indeed secured regulatory approval.\n\nThe assumption is that approval will inspire a new wave of inflows into a market that has long struggled with next to no liquidity.\n\nAs Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price told me: \u201cTo have an ETF launch necessarily represents the maturation of an asset class: it\u2019s a sign that it has arrived in the format that anyone can access . . . you would think that could only be a good thing for crypto.\u201d\n\nBut good news for Wall Street\u2019s crypto-curious is not being welcomed everywhere. Crypto\u2019s longtime believers, who have followed bitcoin\u2019s development since the early days, tell me a financial revolution is being traded in for a spot on Wall Street.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maddening betrayal of crypto\u2019s foundational principles, a sellout to traditional finance and a surrender of our ideals,\u201d said Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture.\n\n\u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision of a permissionless liberation from government now lies in the hands of the world\u2019s largest establishment, asking America\u2019s regulators to approve something that makes bitcoin just like any other asset class,\u201d he added.\n\nSome still fight the good fight. Last month Erik Voorhees, founder of crypto platform ShapeShift and ardent crypto-libertarian, tried to rally the faithful:\n\n\u201cBefore crypto, all movement of funds required someone\u2019s permission . . . try moving ten thousand dollars across a border and you\u2019ll be swiftly reminded of the permissions that are imposed on you . . . so thank God a permissionless form of money was invented.\u201d\n\nBut the excitement around BlackRock illustrates how the narrative on crypto has moved on as the reality of life intrudes. There is an argument that crypto should take what it can get: ETF approvals would be rare wins for a world whose former figurehead is on trial for fraud in New York, and whose biggest surviving companies are facing lawsuits for violating securities laws and illegally accessing US customers.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to imagine that a successful BlackRock application would send the price of bitcoin flying.\n\n\u201cA BlackRock approval can open the tap for a lot of wealth managers and asset managers to take even a small position on bitcoin, it can potentially be a game-changer,\u201d added Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, chief commercial officer at XBTO, a digital assets platform.\n\nBut not even a potential bull run for bitcoin can shake off the sense of capitulation for the industry\u2019s die-hards.\n\nOnly El Salvador and the Central African Republic adopted bitcoin as legal tender, nor did it really bank the unbanked, or seriously provide a financial lifeline to those living under an authoritarian regime.\n\nInstead Wall Street has executed its own takeover. Satoshi envisaged a unfluctuating world, where records are immutable and there are a finite number of bitcoins, 21mn. An ETF is a securitised version of bitcoin but it can be replicated, scaled and traded to match demand.\n\nAs Matthew Cloete, head of marketing at Ryze, a London crypto trading firm, notes:\n\n\u201cMost people think that the ETF is going to be the catalyst for the next bull market, which just goes to show how far we have strayed from the original vision, almost as if we\u2019re throwing in the towel.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on crypto\u2019s hopes for a BlackRock ETF? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nFTX trial latest\n\nThe trial of Sam Bankman-Fried took another turn when the disgraced former FTX kingpin decided he would testify in his own defence.\n\nDefence lawyers don\u2019t usually advise this course of action to clients but observers say the prosecution has put forward a powerful case. Plus, it\u2019s no surprise to anyone who has followed Bankman-Fried closely that he would want to tell his version of events.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defence got off to an unusual start: the judge sent the jury home while he decided what evidence can be repeated in front of jurors when they return today.\n\nHis lawyers have already publicly laid out the plan: SBF was following legal advice in many of his actions and lawyers help draft many of the policies, such as data retention (or lack of it) and how customer money intended for FTX ended up in his Alameda Research trading arm.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Senator Lummis turns up the heat\n\nThe wind has changed direction on crypto in Washington after Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel this month. Last week, I reported that Israeli law enforcement authorities ordered the closure of more than 100 Binance accounts, and Tether had frozen 32 addresses linked to \u201cterrorism and warfare\u201d in Israel and Ukraine.\n\n\n\nNow senator Cynthia Lummis and representative French Hill have urged the Department of Justice to speed up investigations into crypto\u2019s two largest players: the Binance exchange and Tether, the stablecoin provider.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Department of Justice to carefully evaluate the extent to which Binance and Tether are providing material support and resources to support terrorism through violations of applicable sanctions laws and the Bank Secrecy Act. To that end, we strongly support swift action by the Department of Justice against Binance and Tether to choke off sources of funding to the terrorists currently targeting Israel.\u201d\n\nData mining: A final word on BlackRock and bitcoin\n\nThe importance of the US regulator to a bitcoin ETF approval is underscored by location of bitcoin assets under management. The US is far ahead of the rest of the world, as figures from CCData show. Moreover the total value of bitcoin under management has increased by almost $3bn this month, to the highest point since June.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin or a Spot Bitcoin ETF? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Buzz is continuing to grow over the imminent launch of the first spot Bitcoin (BTC -2.96%) exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market. This investment product is widely perceived to be bullish not only for Bitcoin, but also for the entire crypto industry. As a result, just about any bit of ETF-related news can send the price of Bitcoin soaring. On Oct. 23, for example, Bitcoin soared by $4,000 in a span of just 24 hours after a positive update from BlackRock (BLK -1.99%) on its planned Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBut just because a spot Bitcoin ETF might be good for the overall crypto market doesn't mean that it's necessarily good for your portfolio. Here's a closer look at the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nFor individual investors, the biggest advantage of a spot Bitcoin ETF is the lack of many of the biggest barriers to entry for crypto. You don't have to worry about creating an account with a cryptocurrency exchange. You don't have to worry about creating a blockchain wallet to hold your crypto. And you don't have to worry about crypto taxes, which can be hard to figure out.\n\nMoreover, a spot Bitcoin ETF will help to remove much of the perceived \"sketchiness\" of the crypto industry. Any Bitcoin ETF product will have the full blessing of government regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). And it will have the support of big institutional investors on Wall Street. Right now, a handful of different firms are rushing to create spot Bitcoin ETFs, and all of them are instantly recognizable brand names.\n\nAnd, most importantly, any spot Bitcoin ETF will be audited, monitored, tracked, and highly transparent. In short, you won't have to worry about a guy in the Bahamas walking away with all of your Bitcoin holdings, as we saw last year with the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nCons\n\nHowever, buying a Bitcoin ETF does come with a few downsides. For one, you are losing direct access to Bitcoin. When you hold Bitcoin in your own crypto wallet, you can do with it whatever you want. Now that Ferrari accepts Bitcoin, for example, you could use your Bitcoin stash to buy a new car. Or, if a lender allows you to use Bitcoin as collateral for a loan, you could use your Bitcoin holdings. When you buy an ETF, though, you are buying shares in a fund that holds Bitcoin, and not a direct stake in Bitcoin itself.\n\nMoreover, with a Bitcoin ETF, you are paying highly compensated professionals on Wall Street (via fund management fees and expenses) to do something that you can easily do yourself. I have no issue whatsoever paying 1% a year in expenses if these Wall Street professionals are putting together, say, a diversified basket of Brazilian stocks so I can gain access to the Brazilian market. This is something that I couldn't possibly do myself.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Bitcoin, doing it yourself is certainly feasible. And it doesn't require creating an account at a cryptocurrency exchange or dealing with crypto wallets. For example, you can buy and sell Bitcoin via PayPal and Robinhood these days, and all it takes is a few clicks.\n\nCan ETFs really track the performance of Bitcoin?\n\nThe question of whether to buy a spot Bitcoin ETF really comes down to how closely this product will actually track the price of Bitcoin. For example, if the price of Bitcoin goes up by 100% in one year, then you want to make sure that your Bitcoin ETF also goes up 100% in one year. Otherwise, you are potentially leaving money on the table. Over time, these differences could add up.\n\nThe good news is that there are spot Bitcoin ETFs in Canada already, and they seem to do a good job of tracking the price of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin zigs, the ETF zigs. When Bitcoin zags, the ETF zags. This is highly important because the Bitcoin ETFs available today in the U.S. market rely on derivatives (such as futures contracts) to mimic the price of Bitcoin, and this can lead to disparities between the performance of Bitcoin and the performance of the ETF.\n\nCertainly, I expect the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETF products to be a huge positive for Bitcoin. They will open the door even wider for experienced investors to get access to Bitcoin. And these ETFs should help to make Bitcoin go even more mainstream with crypto-curious investors who might be hesitant about getting direct access to Bitcoin these days. If you decide that the pros outweigh the cons, they could be a useful addition to your investment portfolio."

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Spark these Crypto ETFs - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, is on a torrid pace of late, surging more than 16% over the past week amid speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could finally sign off on a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nSome experts believe such approval, which amounts to one of the most widely anticipated events in ETF industry is history, is just months away. It remains to be seen if this is a buy the rumor, sell the news type of event, but some things aren\u2019t up for debate. First, a spot bitcoin ETF would clearly \u2013 it already is \u2013 benefit the digital currency\u2019s price.\n\nSecond, such a product in the U.S. would likely bring a slew of new participants into the crypto market because some retail investors have been reluctant to embrace crypto due to technological concerns. Said another way, a spot bitcoin ETF could democratize the asset class and there\u2019s precedent for happening \u2013 one set by god ETFs.\n\nWhile crypto enthusiasts and ordinary investors wait on word from the SEC, some of the following ETFs could be worth considering.\n\nBitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ)\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) is an equity-based fund, but it\u2019s chock full of stocks that fit the bill as \u201ccrypto-correlated.\u201d BITQ, which follows the Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, is proving as much as highlighted by a gain of 9.28% over the past week.\n\nAs Bitwise itself notes, BITQ\u2019s roster consists of \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d players in the crypto space, including the likes of Microstrategy (MSTR) and crypto exchange operator Coinbase (COIN). Much of the rest of the ETF\u2019s lineup consists of crypto miners \u2013 a group highly tethered to bitcoin\u2019s price action. But there\u2019s more to the story. A recent report by JPMorgan indicates some bitcoin miners are making strides in the artificial intelligence (AI) due to native supercomputing capabilities.\n\n\u201cIn these beta tests, miners are reporting high profitability per unit of power consumption, much above the profitability from bitcoin mining. With bitcoin miners having already secured more than 100MW of long-term contracts with their power grids, if the profitability reported in beta tests is able to be repeated in large scale it would overshadow in the future the revenues coming from bitcoin mining at the moment,\u201d noted the bank.\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\n\nOne of the original futures-backed bitcoin ETFs, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) remains pertinent today because bitcoin futures are, of course, levered to the underlying asset\u2019s price movements. To its credit, BITO, which turned two years old last week, has done a solid job of tracking spot bitcoin prices since inception.\n\nIt goes without saying that BITO would benefit (it already is) from approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, but there are more chapters in this book. Importantly, recent data indicate bitcoin\u2019s correlation to stock is declining, but its correlation to gold is increasing. That fortifies the \u201cdigital gold\u201d thesis.\n\n\u201cWe [view]bitcoin as an investment being a non-sovereign store of value which had potential exposure to economic and internet growth, whilst being largely uncorrelated to other asset classes,\u201d according to CoinShares. \u201cWe also find that in the context of a portfolio, it behaves in a similar manner to other alternative assets in providing diversification, with the exception that its portfolio diversification benefits are far greater than its competitors.\u201d\n\nVanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT)\n\nAs its name implies, the newly minted VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) isn\u2019t a bitcoin ETF. Rather, it\u2019s focused on ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin. EFUT is one of several new futures-based ethereum ETFs that recently came to market, indicating regulators are warming to non-bitcoin crypto fare in the ETF wrapper.\n\nThat could be one sign that if a spot bitcoin ETF is approve, there could be trickle-down effects to fund such as EFUT. Even if that scenario doesn\u2019t come to fruition, ethereum offers investors an attractive fundamental story unto itself.\n\n\u201cEthereum\u2019s limited space is managed through fees charged to users for conducting business and value exchange,\u201d according to VanEck research. \u201cThis software is globally hosted and utilizes a protocol to establish a unified understanding of ownership, commercial activity, and business logic. It enables users to conduct commerce without the need for trust in participants or counterparts. Essentially, Ethereum\u2019s core business revolves around selling secure, immutable blockspace that powers internet commerce.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "3 Buy-Rated Crypto Stocks to Consider as Bitcoin Prices Break Out - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTCUSD) prices have been on a wild ride lately, with the digital currency surging to its highest levels since May 2022 on growing hopes that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might finally give the green light to a spot Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin has now doubled in value on a year-to-date basis, and is hovering right around $34,000 at last check.\n\nCoinbase (COIN), which is a big player in the crypto world, seems pretty confident that this ETF is on the horizon - but shares of the online exchange have shed more than 21% in the last three months while BTC has broken out, and analysts have a tepid consensus rating of \u201chold\u201d on COIN. However, with asset management heavyweights like BlackRock (BLK) getting ready to cash in on regulatory clearance for BTC-based ETFs, it's worth taking a look at some investing opportunities among cryptocurrency and blockchain stocks.\n\nHere, we'll highlight three top-rated crypto stocks, all priced under $10 per share, that have been moving higher with BTC as the market braces for a potentially massive new wave of institutional investing dollars.\n\nBITF: Riding the Bitcoin Wave\n\nBitfarms Ltd. (BITF) is a Canadian Bitcoin mining company offering analytics and engineering services. In August 2023, Bitfarms reported mining a cool 383 new bitcoins - down from August 2022, but up sequentially from July's numbers. Plus, BTC mined through the first eight months of 2023 were higher YOY.\n\nLike most other miners, BITF is in the Bitcoin business - so when BTC prices are up, so is BITF's stock. The stock is up 162.5% YTD to trade around $1.15, and has a market cap of $243 million.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nAll four analysts covering BITF are giving it the green light, with three shouting \"strong buy,\" and one rating the stock a \"moderate buy.\" The average target price for BITF is $3.19, hinting at potential 177% upside from current levels.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nCIFR: Mining for Profits in the Bitcoin Boom\n\nCipher Mining Inc. (CIFR), a New York-based Bitcoin miner, is outperforming broader BTC prices this year. The company has a market cap of $883 million, and CIFR currently trades right around $3.33 per share.\n\nSince the start of 2023, CIFR's stock has rocketed by 492%, leaving BTC's 105% gain in the dust.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nPlus, all seven analysts tracking CIFR rank it a strong buy overall. Five are shouting \"strong buy,\" one's going with a \"moderate buy,\" and one suggests a \"hold.\"\n\nThe mean target price for CIFR is $5.00 is also interesting, given the stock's major rally already this year. That target indicates an expected upside of more than 50% from current levels, suggesting plenty more gains ahead.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nRIOT: Capitalizing on the Crypto Craze\n\nColorado-based Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) might have renamed itself from Riot Blockchain, but the company's primary business is still focused on Bitcoin mining and infrastructure. So, when Bitcoin's up, RIOT's stock is on the rise too.\n\nRIOT's got a relatively hefty market cap of $1.945 billion, and trades just below $10 per share. On a year-to-date basis, RIOT has outpaced BTC prices by gaining 193% - and Wall Street sees more upside ahead.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOut of the 8 analysts following the shares, 6 call RIOT a \u201cstrong buy,\u201d 1 suggests a \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and only 1 is daring to go against the grain with a \u201cstrong sell.\u201d The mean target price for RIOT is $16.67, which represents a healthy premium of 68.5% to current levels.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nThe Future of Crypto Stocks Amid Bitcoin's Breakout\n\nIn conclusion, as Bitcoin continues to flex its muscles and break out, these three buy-rated crypto stocks look intriguing. They've been riding the Bitcoin wave, and with favorable analyst ratings, they're catching the attention of investors.\n\nBut here's the kicker: the crypto market can be an extremely volatile space. CIFR has a beta of 2.50, BITF has a beta of 3.28, and RIOT's beta is 4.31 - indicating all three stocks are considerably more volatile than the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), and are best suited for those investors with a healthy risk appetite. So while the potential upside is appealing, the heightened volatility and continuing regulatory overhang are worth keeping in mind here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Better Bitcoin Stock: Marathon Digital vs. Riot Platforms - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC -2.88%) price has surged more than 30% over the past month for two main reasons. First, BlackRock's (BLK -2.09%) proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) briefly appeared on a clearing house eligibility list, which suggested it might be making gradual progress toward a regulatory approval. If approved, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF would be the first ETF to be pinned to Bitcoin's spot price, which would set it apart other Bitcoin ETFs which are currently tethered to Bitcoin futures.\n\nSecond, the escalating Middle East conflict has been driving investors toward safe haven assets like gold again. Bitcoin is still more volatile than gold, but it could be lumped together with the precious metal as more investors pivot away from fiat currencies while inflation, high interest rates, and global turmoil rattle the global markets.\n\nTherefore, it wasn't surprising to see shares of Marathon Digital (MARA -9.90%) and Riot Platforms (RIOT -7.88%), the two biggest pure-play Bitcoin miners in the world, rally about 11% and 14%, respectively, over the last month. But should investors buy either of these stocks as a long-term play on Bitcoin's growth?\n\nThe differences between Marathon and Digital\n\nMarathon and Riot were both once tiny patent holding companies which abruptly reinvented themselves as Bitcoin miners. Riot, which was formerly known as Bioptix, made that leap in 2017, and Marathon followed that example in 2020. Both companies then ordered tens of thousands of top-tier Antminer mining systems from Bitmain.\n\nMany investors initially dismissed those rebrandings as cheap attempts to cash in on the market hype about Bitcoin. Yet both companies eventually grew their mining operations into sustainable businesses.\n\nRiot had deployed 98,694 miners by the end of September, which gave it a total hash rate capacity (the overall efficiency of its mining operations) of 10.9 EH/s (exahashes per second). It produced an average of 12.1 BTC daily during the month. Marathon has deployed 155,910 miners as of this writing, which gives it a much higher total hash rate capacity of 23.1 EH/s. It was producing an average of 41.1 BTC daily at the end of September.\n\nSimilar headwinds and tailwinds\n\nBoth companies faced tough headwinds over the summer as Bitcoin prices slumped while inflation and adverse weather conditions caused energy prices to soar. However, Riot and Marathon both started to grow their average daily BTC production again on a monthly basis in September as Bitcoin's price rose and energy prices stabilized.\n\nAvg. Daily BTC Production 5/2023 6/2023 7/2023 8/2023 9/2023 Riot Platforms 21.8 15.3 13.2 10.8 12.1 Marathon Digital 40.2 32.6 37.9 34.3 41.1\n\nBoth companies also liquidated some of their own BTC holdings to raise fresh cash over the past year. In September, Riot sold 340 of its mined BTC while Marathon sold 800 BTC. Those ongoing sales should provide both companies with a stable flow of cash to purchase even more miners and scale up their operations.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, Riot held $289 million in cash and $221 million in BTC on its balance sheet. Marathon held $114 million in cash and $380 million in BTC.\n\nBoth companies should have enough capital to ride out their near-term losses. Analysts expect Riot's revenue to rise 22% to $318 million this year as it narrows its net loss from $510 million to $169 million. They expect Marathon's revenue to surge 210% to $366 million (mainly driven by the opening of two new plants and a new joint venture in Abu Dhabi) as it narrows it net loss from $687 million to $61 million.\n\nMarathon seems like the larger and stronger miner, but it has two notable weaknesses. First, it still faces an Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe regarding its joint venture with Beowulf Energy to secure favorable energy rates. Second, its debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2 is much higher than Riot's ratio of 0.1.\n\nThe better buy: Marathon Digital\n\nBoth stocks have similar valuations: Riot trades at nearly seven times this year's sales, while Marathon trades at about six times this year's sales.\n\nI'm not bullish on either of these stocks right now, since I believe it makes more sense to simply buy Bitcoin instead of investing in these capital-intensive miners. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd pick Marathon because it's bigger, produces more Bitcoins every day, and has a much shorter and clearer path toward profitability."

That's down from 2.6 million a year ago.\n\n\"To me, that's suggestive of a potential supply shock,\" Matt Weller, global head of research at Forex.com, told CoinDesk TV on Thursday. \"Essentially, there's not too much bitcoin actively liquid in the market that's available for trade.\"\n\nBitcoin balance on exchanges and price of bitcoin CoinDesk, Glassnode\n\nThe supply crunch could set up bitcoin for another price spike. Earlier this week, bitcoin hit $35,000, the highest since May 2022, on hopes that a spot bitcoin ETF would get regulatory approval soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch an ETF would boost demand for bitcoin, further squeezing the limited supply.\n\n\"With lower supply in the market, it only takes a small bump in demand \u2014 like what we've seen with speculation around the ETF \u2014 to really drive price higher at a rapid rate,\" Weller said.\n\nContributing to the constrained supply is that millions of bitcoin are being held by original \"die hard\" crypto investors. Weller estimated that about 3 million bitcoin tokens haven't been traded in 10 years.\n\nBut if the price of bitcoin soars, that could relieve supply by nudging some investors to sell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike a regular currency, the supply of bitcoin was designed to be finite, capped at 21 million tokens. There are currently 19.5 million tokens in circulation."

        "content": "Bitcoin is trading at an all-time high against Nigeria\u2019s national currency, the naira.\n\nThis price climb is due to the decline of the naira. Nigeria\u2019s currency has fallen 65% compared to the US dollar in the last four months.\n\nDespite the naira\u2019s fall, crypto trading remains popular in Nigeria.\n\nBitcoin is more expensive for Nigerians today than it was two years ago, when it reached its highest price in US dollar terms.\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin is trading at a new all-time high in Africa\u2019s most populous country despite still being only halfway to its peak US dollar price of $69,000 attained in November 2021.\n\nNigeria ranks high in global crypto adoption. However, Nigeria\u2019s crypto fondness is not why bitcoin has grown so expensive in the country. Instead, the reason lies in the massive decline of the naira, or NGN, Nigeria\u2019s national currency.\n\nThe Naira has fallen against the US dollar by 65% since June. This fall resulted from the country\u2019s central bank\u2019s decision in June to allow market forces to determine foreign exchange rates \u2014 a policy known as floating.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nCrypto trading in Nigeria is priced in US dollar terms, which is then converted to the naira value at the day\u2019s exchange rate. The naira has lost so much ground to the dollar that the value of $1 has almost tripled in the country\u2019s currency market since 2021.\n\nAs such, it costs more today in naira terms to become a wholecoiner, a colloquial term for an owner of at least 1 BTC, than it did back when bitcoin hit $69,000 in US dollar terms two years ago.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current US dollar price of about $34,000 is equivalent to 38 million Nigerian naira. BTC is even trading as high as 43 million NGN, according to the rates advertised by some sellers on the Binance peer-to-peer platform.\n\nBy comparison, it cost 29 million NGN in November 2021 to become a wholecoiner.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nPresently, that amount \u2014 29 million NGN \u2014 can only buy three-quarters of a bitcoin, showing the extent of the naira\u2019s depreciation in the last two years.\n\nCrypto still popular\n\nThe falling naira has not, however, dampened enthusiasm for bitcoin and crypto assets. Crypto trading in Nigeria has grown 9% since 2021, according to the latest global cryptocurrency adoption report published by Chainalysis, a blockchain forensics company. Chainalysis ranked the country second in its global crypto adoption index released in September.\n\nMost of the growth since 2021 has been due to sustained interest in bitcoin and stablecoins, especially Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin, the report stated.\n\nStablecoin trading via crypto exchanges in Nigeria has crossed $60 billion over the last two years. Bitcoin volume in the country is nowhere near this mark but there has been a noticeable increase in BTC trading since Nigeria\u2019s government decided to float the naira.\n\nThis flight of funds into bitcoin and stablecoins in Nigeria can be attributed to investors needing to protect the value of their capital, Kola Oyeneyin, CEO of private wealth fund Opportunik Global Fund told DL News.\n\n\u201cAny asset that offers protection in the immediate term becomes the alternative,\u201d Oyeneyin said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the value of digital assets and hard commodities are on the rise in some markets, including Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNigeria is not the only country where bitcoin is trading at a peak price in local currency terms. The same situation is happening in Turkey where the local currency, the Turkish lira, has slumped over 30% against the US dollar since April. As a result, Bitcoin is trading at 960,000 lira now in dollar terms, vs 800,000 lira back in November 2021.\n\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent. He covers DeFi and tech.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What a week it was for mega-cap cryptocurrencies. Three of the most popular digital assets out there, Bitcoin (BTC -2.83%), Ethereum (ETH -3.15%) and Dogecoin (DOGE 3.10%), each saw impressive gains. As of 12:45 p.m. ET on Friday, these three top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization rose 14.7%, 10.4% and 15.4%, respectively, over the past seven days.\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising for many investors to see Bitcoin lead the market higher, as that's par for the course for this space. With roughly half the market cap of the entire crypto sector, the direction Bitcoin moves on a given week typically determines how other digital assets perform.\n\nAccordingly, one might view this week's news that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be hitting the market sooner than thought as the rising tide that's lifting all boats. I certainly think there's something to that.\n\nWith that said, let's dive into what specifically drove these three cryptos higher over the past week and where they may be headed from here.\n\nBitcoin ETF launch dominates the crypto news cycle\n\nIt's been a busy week in the world of crypto, with the Sam Bankman-Fried trial ongoing, various macro-data releases impacting monetary policy decisions released, and a flurry of token-specific news that's been enough to make the heads of many investors in the market spin. Of course, this week's Bitcoin news has dominated the headlines, and for good reason.\n\nEssentially, a number of hints that Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF will finally be pushed over the goal line have materialized this week, with this ETF reportedly being listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation database under the ticker IBTC.\n\nThis ticker appears to have been taken down and put back up again, but the fact that we're seeing this ticker listed is apparently enough of a catalyst for crypto bulls to point to. Many believe this could be the moment Bitcoin is officially viewed as 'open for investment' for institutional investors, much in the same way gold ETFs made investing in precious metals much simpler and more attractive for money managers.\n\nOn that note, I've been reading a number of interesting analyses on this topic, with many experts attempting to quantify what a spot Bitcoin ETF could mean for the digital currency in terms of capital inflows into Bitcoin and the broader sector as a whole. Right now, I think most of these reports require a great deal of guesswork, so I'm not sure how much credence to give these. However, I do think it's true that Bitcoin and Ethereum (assuming a spot Ethereum ETF is next, which would be 100% logical) will receive a big boost from a rush of capital into these alternative assets.\n\nOther, more speculative altcoins, such as Dogecoin, may be well positioned to ride a wave of momentum higher. Dogecoin's price action typically takes its cue from the directional forces created by Bitcoin and Ethereum in a given week.\n\nIndeed, the fact that Dogecoin has moved even higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum on broadly bullish market sentiment outlines the value this token provides traders as a higher-beta option in this space. A number of experts continue to point to \"irrational exuberance\" when discussing Dogecoin's price action over the past few days as the key driver of this token. I tend to agree.\n\nWhere are these three tokens headed from here?\n\nIt's clear that there's robust reason for Bitcoin and Ethereum to be up this week. As for the rest of the market, animal spirits appear to remain high, which is a great thing for crypto speculators banking on yet another catalyst-driven bull run over the near term.\n\nThat said, the extent to which this rally can be sustained beyond a few days remains to be seen. Once a spot Bitcoin ETF is launched (and maybe a similar Ethereum option), it's unclear whether the bullish momentum that's driven valuations higher can continue. Indeed, it could be the latest \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" event. We'll see.\n\nIt's my view that now may be a good time to take a cautious view of this space and wait for the dust to settle before stepping in. These three tokens have made nice moves over the past week, for sure. Let's just see whether these gains will be held before jumping in to ride this latest leg higher."

Highlights of his testimony include denying directing his inner circle to make significant political donations in 2021, as well as claims that FTX\u2019s terms of use covered transactions between Alameda and the crypto exchange. Additionally, Bankman-Fried testified that he requested additional hedging strategies for Alameda in 2021 and 2022, but they were never implemented. The trial is expected to conclude within the next few days.\n\n\u2018Buy Bitcoin\u2019 search queries on Google surge 826% in the UK\n\nGoogle searches for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d have surged worldwide amid a major crypto rally, with searches in the United Kingdom growing by more than 800% in the last week.

In an Oct. 23 filing, the \u201cformal mandate\u201d of the court took effect, paving the way for the SEC to review its decision on Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF. The mandate followed the court\u2019s initial ruling on Aug. 29 and the SEC\u2019s failure to present an appeal by Oct. 13. To date, the SEC has yet to approve a single spot crypto ETF for listing on U.S. exchanges but has given the green light to investment vehicles linked to Bitcoin and Ether futures.\n\nCoinbase disputes SEC\u2019s crypto authority in final bid to toss regulator\u2019s suit\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission overstepped its authority when it classified Coinbase-listed cryptocurrencies as securities, the exchange has argued in its final bid to dismiss a lawsuit by the securities regulator. In an Oct. 24 filing in a New York District Court, Coinbase chastised the SEC, claiming its definition for what qualifies as a security was too wide, and contested that the cryptocurrencies the exchange lists are not under the regulator\u2019s purview. The SEC sued Coinbase on June 6, claiming the exchange violated U.S. securities laws by listing several tokens it considers securities and not registering with the regulator.\n\nGemini sues Genesis over GBTC shares used as Earn collateral, now worth $1.6B\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Gemini filed a lawsuit against bankrupt crypto lender Genesis on Oct. 27.

That collateral is currently worth close to $1.6 billion. According to the suit, Gemini has received $284.3 million from foreclosing on the collateral for the benefit of Earn users, but Genesis has disputed the action, preventing Gemini from distributing the proceeds. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January. It had suspended withdrawals in November 2022, which impacted the Gemini Earn program.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $34,143, Ether (ETH) at $1,789 and XRP at $0.54.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is due to finish 2023 as it started, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode said, as October gains near 30%.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d released Oct. 24, researchers argued that the past week \u201csets the foundation\u201d for a BTC price uptrend.\n\nBTC price \u201cconvincingly\u201d beats out resistance levels\n\nAs it hit $35,200 this week, Bitcoin eclipsed various key trendlines, which had previously acted as support for months.\n\nThese included various moving averages (MA), among them the 200-week simple MA at $28,400 \u2014 the classic \u201cbear market\u201d support line.\n\n\u201cA cluster of long-term simple moving averages of price are located around $28k, and have provided market resistance through September and October,\u201d Glassnode noted.\n\n\u201cAfter a month of the market grinding higher, the bulls found sufficient strength this week to convincingly break through the 111-day, 200-day, and 200-week averages.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart with moving average data (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nIn so doing, the profitability of various investor cohorts improved considerably. The so-called cost basis of speculators and market newcomers also lies near $28,000.\n\n\u201cThe Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis is also now in the rear view mirror at $28k, putting the average recent investor into an average profit of +20%,\u201d \u201cThe Week On-Chain\u201d continued.\n\nResearchers uploaded a chart of the short-term holder market-value-to-realized-value (STH-MVRV) ratio, which tracks the profitability of STH coins. They noted that even prior to the October upside, no major capitulatory behavior was visible.\n\n\u201cWe can see instances in 2021-22 where STH-MVRV reached relatively deep corrections of -20% or more,\u201d they explained.\n\n\u201cWhilst the August sell-off did reach a low of -10%, it is noteworthy how shallow this MVRV decline is by comparison, suggesting the recent correction found noteworthy support, being a precursor to this week\u2019s rally.\u201d\n\nBitcoin STH-MVRV annotated chart (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin \u201csets the foundation\u201d for green year\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the presence of STH entities versus their seasoned counterparts, the long-term holders (LTHs), is now historically low.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price model expects $45K \u2018phase\u2019 to hit in November\n\nDespite facing profitability issues of their own, LTHs now own more than three-quarters of the available BTC supply for the first time.\n\nTheir cost basis is lower, further toward $20,000 \u2014 and while some believe that Bitcoin could still return to that area, Glassnode is optimistic over how the year will end.\n\n\u201cA meaningful proportion of supply and investors now find themselves above the average break-even price, located around $28k,\u201d it concluded.\n\n\u201cThis sets the foundation for a resumption of the 2023 uptrend. At the very least, the market has crossed over several key levels where aggregate investor psychology is likely to be anchored, making the weeks that follow important to keep an eye on.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass\n\nPer data from on-chain monitoring resource CoinGlass, BTC/USD is currently up 26% this month \u2014 by October standards, still relatively modest.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Could Bitcoin (BTC) be headed for an imminent pullback? Some crypto market observers believe the answer could be hiding within the price action of a frog-themed memecoin.\n\nIn an Oct. 27 post on X (formerly Twitter), Onchain Capital co-founder and Crypto Banter host Ran Neuner suggested that memecoin Pepe (PEPE) is a strong indicator of overblown crypto market fever.\n\nIf you want to know when a pull back is coming, just watch $PEPE.

Works every time.\u201d\n\nPepe recently witnessed a more than 100% gain, growing from $0.00000064 on Oct. 20 to a peak of 0.00000134 on Oct. 27. Around the same time Pepe reached its peak, Bitcoin had already begun sliding downward from a recently attained yearly high.\n\nNeuner\u2019s theory has been shared by other crypto traders in the past. On Sept. 23, trader Alex RTB told his 60,000 followers that he had begun using Pepe as a reliable metric for impending short-term declines.\n\nThis $PEPE pump is another indicator of upcoming #BTC dump.\n\n\n\nI am speaking with experience, you can check past price movements.\n\n\n\nPumping coins like $PEPE, $DOGE, $XRP, $IMX, $LINK always indicates the bloodbath, let's see how it goes this time. pic.twitter.com/piseCxRiqD \u2014 Alex RT\u20bf (@rutradebtc) September 22, 2023\n\nHowever, the theory also attracted its fair share of skeptics, who claim the data hasn\u2019t always supported the theory.\n\nRelated: BTC price pullback after $35K? Bitcoin funding rates turn \u2018grossly positive\u2019\n\nDubai-based trader Reetika told Cointelegraph that Pepe\u2019s recent uptick was largely driven by bullish news regarding changes in the team and the fact that it would be burning additional tokens and that it wasn\u2019t necessarily a sign of broader overconfidence in the market.\n\n6.9T $PEPE Tokens worth ~$6,000,000 have been burned. https://t.co/aN5LRUFz8u\n\n\n\nA new team of advisors have been brought on to guide Pepe forward.

Source: TradingView\n\nReetika, meanwhile, suggested looking at Solana\u2019s SOL (SOL) as a potentially more reliable predictor.\n\n\u201cSOL has been a very good leading indicator for the moves so far. It has broken out of resistances at least a day before BTC/ETH over this entire move. I\u2019ve been using it actionably for estimating upside,\u201d she said.\n\nReetika, however, clarified that SOL isn\u2019t a perfect indicator either but had performed well on the most recent move.\n\nSimilarly, market commentator and avid crypto shitposter Poordart told Cointelegraph that Pepe probably isn\u2019t the best metric from which to gauge the future price action of majors like Bitcoin.\n\nIn Poordarts\u2019 view, Pepe is still far too new to the market to have any \u201creal lasting value\u201d as a reliable metric to gauge the price movements of Bitcoin with any significant accuracy.\n\nMagazine: Beyond crypto \u2014 Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance"

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction: Nearly 3% Drop Raises Concerns of Additional Downtrend\n\nWith the recent dip in Bitcoin prices, there are concerns among investors about a further downtrend. The popular cryptocurrency saw a nearly 3% drop, leading some to believe that the market is entering a bearish phase.\n\nThis latest development has left many wondering about the future of Bitcoin and whether it can recover from this setback.\n\nIn this update, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the recent dip in Bitcoin prices and provide insights into what it could mean for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nBinance Suspends Bitcoin Withdrawals for Second Time in 12 Hours\n\nBinance has once again temporarily stopped allowing BTC withdrawals, citing a significant backlog of outstanding withdrawal requests.\n\nEarlier on May 7, Binance had to briefly halt Bitcoin withdrawals due to an alleged overflow of transactions on the blockchain.\n\nOver half an hour later, withdrawals were once again permitted. However, on May 8, Binance reported again that it had temporarily closed BTC withdrawals due to the large volume of pending transactions.\n\nThere are 400,000 pending transactions on the bitcoin network and binance halted transactions due to the congestion and high fees\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been warning people of this for months and the righteous bitcoin maxis have kept their mouths shut because they can\u2019t admit bitcoin has any\u2026 pic.twitter.com/jIopTRj7j8 \u2014 Crypto Tea (@CryptoTea_) May 7, 2023\n\nThere are reports of approximately 400,000 transactions waiting in the Bitcoin mempool for processing, and at the time of the second Binance withdrawal halt, the number of backlogged transactions in the mempool was around 485,000.\n\nBREAKING: #Binance outflow data confirms largest withdrawal in it's history, over 162,000 $BTC has left the exchange, valued at over $4.6 Billion.\n\n\n\nAre Whales/Insiders jumping ship? \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/QSXYAEvHkt \u2014 WhaleWire (@WhaleWire) May 7, 2023\n\nThe mempool serves as an area where transactions are kept at a \u201cwaiting\u201d status before being verified by each blockchain node.\n\nThese transactions were worth more than $5 billion, and this caused Binance to halt BTC withdrawals for the second time in 12 hours.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 #BTC deposit and withdrawal services on #OKX are running fine.

Local authorities there have taken steps to legalize Bitcoin payments for specific taxes and costs associated with providing public services.\n\nThis news helped to cap some of the losses in BTC/USD prices.\n\nMicroStrategy Continuously Increasing BTC Holdings for 11 Quarters\n\nThe publicly traded company, MicroStrategy, has benefited from the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the past few months, enabling it to report a net profit of $461 million in Q1.\n\nThe revenue from the software division was also higher than expected. Tax benefits from the company\u2019s BTC holdings contributed to this growth.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s share price has increased in the first few months of the year.\n\nOn January 1, MSTR stocks were valued at around $145; as of now, they are worth approximately $318, representing a 120% increase.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 MicroStrategy Increased its BTC Holdings for 11 Consecutive Quarters: MicroStrategy has purchased bitcoin each quarter ever since embracing the BTC strategy. \u2764\ufe0f\uff06\ud83d\udd01 #Bitcoin #Crypto #Nft https://t.co/agR4XalNod pic.twitter.com/KmYz6wkF3G \u2014 Realized_Gains (@REALIZEDGAIN5) May 7, 2023\n\nDespite the volatile nature of cryptocurrency and the bear market of last year, the business intelligence company has remained loyal to strengthening its BTC positions in recent years.\n\nThe quarterly report showed that the company has increased its BTC holdings for the 11th consecutive quarter.\n\nThis positive news also helped BTC/USD limit its losses for the day.\n\nRise in Popularity of Memecoin Leads to Multi-Year Highs in Bitcoin Transaction Costs\n\nBitcoin (BTC) transaction fees have reached a two-year high due to the increased trading activity of memecoins like Pepe.\n\nThis week, the total fees paid on the Bitcoin network increased by approximately 400% compared to late April, totaling about $3.5 million.\n\nMemecoin hype drives Bitcoin transaction fees to multi-year highs\n\n\n\nDespite the latest spike in Bitcoin transaction fees, the current BTC transaction cost is still far from all-time high levels.#Bitcoin #Altcoin pic.twitter.com/gy9MOwKhaq \u2014 Crypto Bernard Wong (@Wong_insight) May 5, 2023\n\nMemecoins have gained popularity in the cryptocurrency industry, and the BRC-20 token standard for Bitcoin has emerged as the latest development in response.\n\nThis standard has been used to create 8,500 distinct tokens.\n\nBitcoin Price\n\nBitcoin is currently experiencing a slightly bearish trend, trading at $28,978, which is mostly unchanged and has bounced off by 0.10%. The BTC/USD pair is building on its earlier daily gains and is moving towards the $30K mark.\n\nOn Monday, Bitcoin\u2019s bearish trend pushed it below the $28,500 support level, and technical indicators like RSI and MACD signal a continued bearish bias.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nBTC has failed to cross the 50-day exponential moving average, causing it to head toward the $28,000 support level. If it breaks below, it could target $27,700.\n\nDespite the oversold RSI, the breached trend line at $28,350 suggests that bearish momentum will likely continue.\n\nConsider a sell position below $28,500 with a target of $27,750. If Bitcoin crosses above $28,500, it could target $29,000 or $29,750.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nThe Cryptonews Industry Talk team has put together a list of the top 15 cryptocurrencies for 2023, each showcasing considerable growth potential in both the short and long term.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Sets $45,000 Target And It\u2019s Closer Than You Think - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin rallied above $35,000 on the back of the euphoria of the possible approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Although the rally seems to have cooled off, a particular crypto analyst\u2019s prediction suggests that the bulls could enjoy total dominance soon enough in what will see the flagship cryptocurrency rise to $45,000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Incoming Phase Could See It Hit $45,000\n\nIn a post shared on their X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto analyst CryptoCon shared his prediction on Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory. The analyst mentioned that Bitcoin was currently at the \u201cMid-Cycle phase 4,\u201d which happens to be the period where the crypto token is heading closer to the \u201cCycle Mid-Top,\u201d which currently positions Bitcoin to rise above $45,000.\n\nCryptoCon\u2019s prediction seems to be made based on the Fibonacci trading strategy, as evident in the accompanying chart, which he shared in his post. The chart breaks down Bitcoin\u2019s historical price data into four cycles, namely: Cycle 1 (2010-2014), Cycle 2 (2015-2018), Cycle 3 (2019-2022), and Cycle 4 (2023-2026).\n\nSource: X\n\nThe Phases In These Cycles\n\nThese cycles are further divided into five phases, which CryptoCon seemed to focus more on. These phases include Phase 1 (Cycle Lows), Phase 2 (Transition from Cycle Lows), Phase 3 (First Move out of the Lows), Phase 4 (Transition to Cycle Mid-Top), and Phase 5 ( Cycle Mid-Top).\n\nCryptoCon noted that Bitcoin\u2019s price usually hits phase 5 quickly once phase 2 is over (about two months after, according to the analyst), and if that is the case once again, then $45,000 could be soon. If that doesn\u2019t happen, he foresees that Bitcoin could face resistance at the top of the transition, where it is currently priced at $36,368.\n\nAs to when all this could happen, he noted that October represents the first month after phase 2 ended. Therefore, the market could see the mid-top phase could happen as soon as November when Bitcoin will likely hit and rise above $45,000.\n\nInterestingly, CryptoCon\u2019s prediction coincides with that of the crypto platform Matrixport, which estimates that Bitcoin could hit $45,000 between November this year and April 2024. In their report, Matrixport goes on to make a bolder claim that Bitcoin could hit $125,000 by December 2024.\n\nSource: Matrixport\n\nBitcoin Halving Or Institutional Adoption?\n\nDifferent crypto analysts have continued to make predictions about Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory even as the Bitcoin Halving draws nearer. Some of these analysts have credited the event as the catalyst that will spark the massive surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price. Others believe that the launch of a Spot Bitcoin ETF alongside institutional adoption is what will make Bitcoin hit new highs.\n\nMeanwhile, some contemplate that the market may already be priced in as to any impending approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, as this is a classic case of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news.\u201d If that is the case, many predict that we could see a decline when the ETFs launch due to massive sell-offs from traders and investors looking to realize their gains.\n\nBTC maintains above $34,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, the pause in the digital asset market was on the cards after a sizable rally in the last few days. However, analysts see the buying interest to remain in the digital asset market in the next few days.\n\n\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking as the largest crypto token declined over a per cent but somehow managed to hold about 34,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen in red, marginally lower, and remained below $1,800-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with cuts.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market seems to be cooling off from its seven-day streak of rally. The crypto fear and greed index is also well within the greed zone with a score of 70/100, signalling bullish sentiments among crypto investors.

This led to market optimism.\n\n\"Remarkably, crypto as an asset class has been decoupling from other 'risk on' assets like equities, which corrected sharply due to the rising macro and geo-political instability,\" added Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Venture.\n\nOn Friday, the market saw a sell-off but it was majorly due to profit booking. \"The crypto market is showing signs of cooling off after the mega rally in the past few days,\" said Shivam Thukral, chief executive officer (CEO) of BuyUcoin.\n\nWhat to expect?\n\n\"Bitcoin is moving up by taking support from the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA-D). However, it's still facing a challenge at the $35,000 level. If it successfully breaks through, it could reach the $39,000 to $40,000 range, with potential support around $31,000 to $32,000. For Ethereum, the $1,740 level may act as a support, and crossing $1,860 could push it toward $2,000,\" the crypto exchange CoinDCX research team said."

        "title": "Trezor Safe 3 Review: A Hardware Wallet for Bitcoin Newcomers - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief The Trezor Safe 3 is the latest hardware wallet from Trezor.\n\nIt's aimed at \u201cnew entrants\u201d to the crypto space.\n\nIt's the first Trezor hardware wallet to feature a secure element.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA long-established name in the crypto space, Trezor's line of hardware wallets has provided users with a reliable, if unshowy, means of self-custodying their Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\n\nNow it's branching out, with the Trezor Safe 3\u2014a hardware wallet that's explicitly courting newcomers with its slick design language and user-friendly UX.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWill it be enough to win the wallet wars?\n\nWhat is the Trezor Safe 3?\n\nThe latest addition to the firm\u2019s line of cryptocurrency hardware wallets, the Trezor Safe 3 is aimed at \u201cnew entrants\u201d to the crypto space, according to its CEO Mat\u011bj \u017d\u00e1k.\n\nThe idea is to provide a simple, secure solution for crypto holders to self-custody their assets\u2014taking their crypto out of the hands of centralized exchanges, which have proved vulnerable to both hacks and alleged corporate malfeasance, putting user funds at risk.\n\nJust 2% of the world\u2019s 420 million crypto users self-custody, \u017d\u00e1k told Decrypt, so there\u2019s definitely an opportunity\u2014but is this latest iteration of Trezor\u2019s hardware wallet enough to win them over?\n\nTrezor Safe 3: Design and Build\n\nThe Trezor Safe 3 comes in four colors. Image: Decrypt\n\nThe first wave of crypto hardware wallets were clunky, functional affairs, designed for die-hard early adopters who were prepared to overlook aesthetics and streamlined UX for the benefits of self-custody.\n\nTo broaden their appeal, wallet manufacturers like Trezor have taken design cues from mainstream consumer electronics (rival Ledger even enlisted the designer of Apple\u2019s iPod for its forthcoming Stax device).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the Trezor Safe 3 follows the design cues of its stablemates, with a familiar shield-shaped design, screen, and button layout, the materials have had an upgrade.\n\nThe device sports a brushed aluminum back with the company's logo, in a variety of colorways that hark back to smartphones: silver, gold, rose gold, and \u201ccosmos black.\u201d\n\nThat aluminum finish isn\u2019t quite as polished as the smartphones it mimics, though.\n\nThe review units sent to Decrypt were cut slightly roughly around the edges where they meet the plastic surround. The surround itself had a somewhat rough finish, too; all six of the supplied review units had what seemed to be flash marks or glue overspills that were noticeable when running a finger around the edge of the unit.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, as it lets down the premium consumer electronics feel that the company\u2019s aiming for (Trezor has since clarified that the review units supplied to Decrypt were pre-production models, and that the finish on the final production models should be smoother).\n\nTrezor Safe 3 and Ledger Nano S Plus. Image: Decrypt\n\nAt 14g, it\u2019s slightly less hefty in the hand than its nearest rival, the 21g Ledger Nano S Plus. The buttons have a satisfyingly clicky feel, too; more emphatic than those of the Ledger, while their placement next to each other means that you can depress both buttons with a single thumb click.\n\nThe Safe 3\u2019s display is a simple monochrome affair, unlike the whizzy touchscreen on Trezor\u2019s top-of-the-line Model T wallet. At 128 x 64 pixels, its screen resolution is identical to Ledger\u2019s rival wallet\u2014though slightly dimmer, when seen side by side.\n\nWithin Trezor Suite there\u2019s an option to set a background wallpaper, though on the device\u2019s tiny screen, the graphics aren\u2019t much to look at.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrezor Safe 3: What\u2019s in the box?\n\nBuilding on its consumer-friendly credentials, the Trezor Safe 3 comes packaged in a minimalist box in eco-friendly recycled packaging.\n\nTear off the shrink wrap and cardboard seal (the first line of crypto security) and a flap opens to reveal the contents: the Safe 3 itself, a USB-C cable, and a cardboard sleeve containing a quick start guide, two sheets for recording your recovery seed, and a collection of stickers if you want to advertise your crypto holdings to all and sundry.\n\nTrezor Safe 3 box contents. Image: Decrypt\n\nThe device itself sports a tamper-proof holographic security seal, to indicate that the device hasn\u2019t been handled since it went into the box in the Trezor factory.\n\nThe overall impression is one of a quality mass-market consumer electronics device, akin to something from Samsung or Amazon.\n\nTrezor Safe 3: Getting started\n\nFirst things first, you\u2019ll need to remove that holographic seal to reveal the Safe 3\u2019s USB-C port. Next, you\u2019ll need to plug it into your PC or Mac with the supplied USB-C cable (which, as ever, is too short\u2014designed with laptop users in mind, rather than your reviewer\u2019s desktop PC).\n\nTrezor Suite. Image: Trezor\n\nUpon plugging the Safe 3 in, you\u2019re immediately greeted with an in-browser popup telling you to \u201cgo to trezor.io to connect\u201d\u2014a nice touch. Upon heading to https://trezor.io/start, you\u2019re prompted to download the Trezor Suite management software to set up the device.\n\nUpon installing Trezor Suite, you\u2019ll be invited to update the Safe 3\u2019s firmware, before a check is performed to determine whether you have a legitimate Trezor device. A short tutorial follows to educate you on how the Trezor\u2019s two-button user interface works.\n\nNext up, you\u2019ll create a new wallet (or backup from a recovery seed)\u2014you have the choice of a standard 12-word wallet or a more complex, but secure, Shamir backup, which creates several lists of words that have to be combined to recover the wallet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCuriously, upon creating a new wallet you\u2019re given the option of skipping the backup phase entirely.\n\nWhile using your wallet without creating a backup will cause Trezor Suite to light up like a Christmas tree with warning messages, it\u2019s curious that the option is even there; Ledger\u2019s setup process forces you to check words from your seed phrase in order to proceed.\n\nTrezor Suite. Image: Trezor\n\nAssuming sense and reason haven\u2019t deserted you, the next thing you\u2019ll do is create your backup. This involves taking note of your 12-word seed phrase on your Safe 3, and then checking a selection of words off to ensure you\u2019ve recorded it correctly. Trezor Suite helpfully warns you not to take a photo of your backup, create a digital copy of it, or share it with anyone.\n\nNext up, you\u2019ll activate a selection of coins to show in Trezor Suite, before proceeding to the app proper.\n\nTrezor Safe 3: Trezor Suite\n\nTrezor Suite, a desktop app for Windows and Mac, is where the majority of the action happens; you\u2019ll need to connect your Trezor with the supplied USB-C cable to access your holdings.\n\nTrezor Suite. Image: Trezor\n\nThe app is slickly designed, and intuitive. Once you\u2019ve connected and unlocked your Safe 3, a dashboard shows your portfolio, supported assets, and a checklist of security features, including whether you\u2019ve created a backup, PIN, and passphrase. A \u201cDiscreet mode\u201d blurs balances and transactions from prying eyes, revealing them only on mouseover.\n\nYou can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum and other assets directly from the dashboard, with Trezor serving up a list of offers from different providers, listing fees, payment method and exactly how many sats you\u2019ll be stacking with each option.\n\nAn accounts tab shows your crypto accounts in more detail; it\u2019s here that you\u2019ll send and receive crypto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClick \u201csend\u201d and a window pops up with address and amount details, which you\u2019ll need to cross-reference on the Trezor device before signing the transaction. To receive crypto, you\u2019ll reveal your wallet address and a QR code\u2014which, again, you\u2019ll check against that displayed on your Trezor device.\n\nTrezor Suite's \"discreet mode\" blurs balances and transactions. Image: Trezor\n\nA Trade button takes you to a screen where you can buy, sell, or swap your crypto\u2014or even spend it using Bitrefill, which lets you purchase a selection of gift cards and phone refills.\n\nThere\u2019s also an associated mobile app, Trezor Suite Lite, which lets you view account balances and receive crypto, after you\u2019ve scanned your public key or received the address QR code in the main app.\n\nWallet features and assets\n\nOne of Trezor\u2019s key USPs is the additional privacy features baked into Trezor Suite. The app includes native support for Tor, which relays your connection through a network of distributed servers for greater anonymity.\n\nTrezor Suite also supports Coinjoin for Bitcoin transactions. The privacy-enhancing technique enables multiple users to pool their Bitcoin inputs into a single transaction, and receive the same amount of Bitcoin output but with a different address.\n\nThe end result is that it\u2019s more difficult to trace individual transactions back to their original sources, adding a much-needed layer of privacy to Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThe Trezor Safe 3 supports several hundred crypto assets, including Bitcoin, XRP, BNB, Litecoin, and Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThere are one or two omissions, though; if you want to interact with Cosmos tokens, for instance, you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA limited-edition Bitcoin-only Trezor Safe 3 is available. Image: Decrypt\n\nA \u201cBitcoin-only\u201d limited edition Trezor Safe 3 is also available, with variant packaging and a unique Bitcoin Orange finish (though technically speaking it\u2019s possible to make any Safe 3 \u201cBitcoin-only\u201d by changing the firmware in Trezor Suite).\n\nAs well as Trezor Suite, the Trezor Safe 3 can also be used with third-party software wallets including MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, and Ronin.\n\nWallet security\n\nUnlike other Trezor hardware wallets, the Safe 3 includes a secure element, an isolated chip that stores a secret that can decrypt the device\u2019s recovery seed. The Safe 3\u2019s secure element is CC EAL 6+ certified, compared to the EAL 5+ certification found on its nearest rival, the Ledger Nano S Plus.\n\nIncorporating a secure element is a big change for Trezor, which has previously relied entirely on open-source hardware (unlike rival hardware wallet manufacturers), and the company is at pains to stress that the secure element doesn\u2019t have access to your PIN or recovery seed itself.\n\nThe complete Trezor Safe 3 lineup. Image: Decrypt\n\nFurthermore, Trezor notes that its code remains open source, enabling the community of users to verify the integrity of its code and stress test it. And, it states, it has sourced its secure element chips from a producer that doesn\u2019t prevent it from disclosing potential vulnerabilities.\n\nUpon first launching Trezor Suite, the software performs an integrity check on your Safe 3, to verify that it\u2019s genuine Trezor hardware, while a \u201csafety check\u201d feature (which can be disabled) prevents the device from performing non-standard transactions, such as mismatching keys or enabling extreme fees.\n\nOne oddity, as mentioned above, is that the Trezor will let you set up and use the device without recording your backup recovery phrase. Although it flashes up warning messages until you record and verify your backup, in a device aimed at crypto newcomers it feels like this step should be mandatory, not an option.\n\nTrezor Safe 3: Verdict\n\nThe Trezor Safe 3 is a slick, well-designed piece of kit that almost (but not quite) matches the design and build standards of consumer electronics hardware like smartphones and tablets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith an interface that\u2019s about as user-friendly as hardware wallets can get, it\u2019s a cost-effective way to self-custody for crypto newcomers and veterans alike\u2014although it doesn\u2019t offer access to quite as many tokens as its nearest rival, the Ledger Nano S Plus.\n\nCompared to the Ledger, the Safe 3\u2019s higher level of security certification, as well as its additional privacy features, make for a compelling case\u2014though security purists may prefer to eschew the single point of failure that a secure element represents, and take their chances with the Model T and Model One\u2019s entirely open source hardware.\n\nEdited by Liam J.
