        "title": "Bitcoin slides after network congestion leads Binance to briefly halt withdrawals - CNBC",
        "content": "\"Only a break back below $25,000 would give reason for concern. Until then, we suspect dips will continue to be very well supported,\" he added.\n\n\"Reports of a large bitcoin outflow and withdrawals being paused at a major exchange could be factoring into some of the weakness we're seeing. Ultimately however, there haven't been any major developments as far as price action goes, with bitcoin still very much confined to a multiday bullish consolidation,\" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was lower by 5.3% at $27,420.73, according to Coin Metrics. It has fallen 7% since Saturday. Ether fell 4.3% on Monday to $1,833.72.\n\nBitcoin fell to start the week, extending losses from a sharp drop over the weekend following reports by one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world about \"congestion\" on the Bitcoin network.\n\nMonday's drop came after Binance tweeted Sunday that the Bitcoin network was \"experiencing a congestion issue\" and that it was temporarily closing bitcoin withdrawals as a result until the network stabilized. Some market participants have argued that the Bitcoin network is stable and Binance should have prepared for a high-fee environment on Bitcoin.\n\nThe issue has highlighted a long-known setback of the Bitcoin network: It wasn't designed to handle a large number of transactions at scale. It processes just seven to 10 transactions per second, making it unviable as a potential rival to companies such as Visa and Mastercard \u2014 an idea many have explored over the years but largely put to rest. This is why projects such as the Lightning Network, which helps speed up transactions without affecting the network, have gained in popularity.\n\nService on Binance resumed, but later on Sunday evening the exchange again halted withdrawals.\n\n\"To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted,\" the Binance account tweeted. \"We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed. Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.\"\n\nA 'parabolic spike'\n\nAlex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, noted a \"parabolic spike\" in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network last week, attributing it to users minting BRC-20 tokens. These are an experimental token on the Bitcoin blockchain that ultimately allow users to create NFTs on Bitcoin. They're inspired by Ethereum's ERC-20 token.\n\nOn May 1, about 50% of bitcoin transactions were BRC-20 mints, Thorn highlighted in a note Friday. In the 14 days preceding Friday, mean transaction fees on Bitcoin increased 297%.\n\n\"There is an increasing demand for BRC-20 tokens which include transferring digital collectibles on Bitcoin network,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau. \"The Bitcoin network has gradually supported more different types of tokens like NFTs. This adoption should be a positive sign longer term but it looks like it has slowed down the network.\""

        "content": "Last month, Standard Chartered released a report that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) can hit $100,000 by the end of 2024. The target seems steep, but cryptocurrencies have a history of skyrocketing in the blink of an eye.\n\nStandard Chartered cites stress in the traditional banking system as one of the catalysts for a Bitcoin rally. I believe that a dovish stance by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2023 will also contribute to the rally.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin halving is due in 2024. Going by past instances, the halving event is followed by a rally for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. With these positives, it\u2019s a good time to accumulate quality crypto projects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, investment can also be considered in some of the best crypto stocks for a Bitcoin rally. If Bitcoin touches $100,000, the crypto stocks to buy can deliver multibagger returns.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these crypto stocks.\n\nCoinbase (COIN)\n\nCoinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the second largest crypto exchange in the world, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is among the best crypto stocks to buy.\n\nOn the day of the Q1 2023 results, COIN stock surged by 18%. This was on the back of a revenue and earnings beat. With Bitcoin likely to trend higher, I believe that COIN will remain in an uptrend.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the rally in Bitcoin and the broader crypto space translates into higher trading and speculative activity. The recovery in revenue along with margin improvement is on the cards in the coming quarters.\n\nCoinbase is also expanding its addressable market potential. In Q1, the company made inroads in Canada, Brazil, and Singapore. With plans to expand into more markets, revenue growth acceleration is likely to be meaningful.\n\nThe company\u2019s subscription and services revenue has also continued to swell. For Q1, the revenue was $361.7 million, which was higher by over 100% on a year-on-year basis. With a strong retail and institutional client base, the outlook is positive for COIN stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nblockchain\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) has skyrocketed by 242% in year-to-date 2023. During this period, Bitcoin has surged by over 70%. The big rally is an indicator of the upside potential if Bitcoin touches $100,000.\n\nAs an overview, Riot Platforms is a Bitcoin miner. There are two reasons to like Riot over peers. First, the company has a solid balance sheet with zero debt and $230 million in cash and equivalents.\n\nFurther, Riot is a low-cost miner. Last year, the company reported a gross mining margin of 60.3%. With Bitcoin trending higher, I expect healthy EBITDA margin expansion and cash flow upside for the company.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Riot has been continuously increasing its mining capacity. As of April, the company reported a capacity of 10.6EH/s. Riot expects to boost capacity to 12.5EH/s in the second half of 2023. Considering the balance sheet health, I expect capacity expansion to continue. Therefore, there is visibility for robust revenue growth in 2023 and beyond.\n\nBlock (SQ)\n\nSquare, Inc. (SQ) logo seen displayed on smart phone. Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) stock has been in a sustained downtrend. However, it remains in my list of best crypto stocks for a Bitcoin rally.\n\nIt was back in December 2021 that Square re-branded as Block. The idea was to emphasize the company\u2019s focus on blockchain technology. The bear market for cryptocurrencies has impacted developments. However, as the crypto winter ends, there are reasons to be bullish.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the company\u2019s Cash App is being used to buy and sell Bitcoin. Additionally, it was reported in 2021 that the company is building a decentralized finance business using Bitcoin. Last year, it was reported that Jack Dorsey was building Web5 based on Bitcoin.\n\nMy point is that there are developments in the background. Block has ample financial flexibility to invest in blockchain technology. With a big correction in SQ stock, it seems like a good time to accumulate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

As reported in local news, the micro-European nation continues to embrace blockchain technologies.\n\nRisch, who also serves as finance minister, is quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cA payment option with Bitcoin is coming.\u201d\n\nHowever, he did not give a timeframe. Moreover, the principality is unlikely to accept Bitcoin and \u201chodl\u201d (hold onto) the satoshis it receives. Instead, it will accept deposits in Bitcoin and immediately exchange them for Swiss francs, the national currency. The direct exchange into fiat money sidesteps the currency\u2019s volatility.\n\nDespite not being a European Union member, Liechtenstein is part of the European Economic Area, where the EU\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation could apply. This regulatory clarity could attract more crypto firms to the region.\n\nSimilar to Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, Lichtenstein is a small but thriving cryptocurrency hub in Europe. The Liechtenstein Blockchain Act, which passed in 2019, provided clear crypto regulation, with several crypto-focused businesses setting up operations in the country since.\n\nThe nation follows a similar course to the nearby Swiss communities of Zug and Lugano, which accept Bitcoin for some taxes and public services, with retailers, including the likes of McDonald\u2019s, also accepting BTC.\n\nNonetheless, the sixth smallest nation in the world is cautious in its approach to investing in Bitcoin or crypto. Risch expressed that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are currently too risky for the country\u2019s multibillion-dollar treasury, but the verdict may change in the future.\n\nRelated: Liechtenstein adapts blockchain laws to developing crypto landscape\n\nThis move by Liechtenstein coincides with a growing trend of smaller nations embracing cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "content": "Amid Bitcoin\u2019s recent spike in transaction fees, block number 788695 marks a special milestone for miners: For the first time since 2017, the transaction fees in a single block surpassed the block rewards doled out to miners. Transaction fees in the block clocked in at 6.7 Bitcoin, beating the block subsidy of 6.25 Bitcoin.\n\nThough this spike in fees has thrown a curveball to users, this block shows how it's benefitting Bitcoin miners, the global network of volunteers that run expensive, specialized computers to secure the Bitcoin network. They\u2019re the ones raking in this newfound treasure trove of fees.\n\nBREAKING: #Bitcoin block 788695 contained transaction fees greater than the block subsidy. 6.7 BTC transaction fees + 6.25 BTC subsidy This is a the first time in history this has ever occurred due to competitively high block space demand. pic.twitter.com/J7IcwzIVKE \u2014 Joe Burnett (\ud83d\udd11)\u00b3 (@IIICapital) May 7, 2023\n\nBitcoin miners have two sources of income built in for them. One is the block subsidy. Roughly every 10 minutes, miners are awarded 6.25 Bitcoin. This value is split in half every four years in an event known as the Bitcoin \u201chalvening.\u201d\n\nThe second source is transaction fees. Users optionally can tag on a fee to every Bitcoin transaction. If there's more demand for Bitcoin, users need to hike their fee if they want it to get through in a timely manner. There's been lots of demand recently, pushing the average fee up to $19 according to cryptocurrency statistics website BitInfoCharts.\n\nAs such, the transaction fee source of income fluctuates somewhat erratically with demand.\n\n'Attack on Bitcoin\u2019 Claims Circulate as Transaction Fees Climb Higher\n\nOne reason bitcoiners find this surplus in fees so monumental is that eventually \u2014 in more than a hundred years \u2014 transaction fees will be miners' sole source of income. But transaction fees fluctuate so often, it hasn\u2019t yet been proven that it will provide a consistent source of income when that time finally rolls around.\n\nMiners are the glue holding Bitcoin together. The more hashing power provided by miners securing Bitcoin, the more secure Bitcoin is. But miners are unlikely to secure the network if they aren\u2019t paid to do it. Therefore it could be bad for Bitcoin if transaction fees don\u2019t increase over the years.\n\nBlock 788695 is a small, optimistic sign that fees could increase, even if it hasn't proved a consistent form of income for miners just yet. As self-custody platform Casa CTO Jameson Lopp put it on Twitter: \"The model for thermodynamic security has been proven possible. The only remaining question is if this demand is sustainable.\""

On May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping nearly 400% from late April, Cointelegraph reported.\n\nBitcoin outflow on Binance over the past seven days. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nDeveloped after Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard recently introduced that allows users to create and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is currently becoming a hot spot for meme tokens.\n\nCoinMarketCap\u2019s data shows that PEPE\u2019s price has climbed over 263% in the last week. As of writing, however, the memecoin is down over 7% following a 30% drop on May 6 as whales profited from Binance's recent listing. Crypto exchanges MEXC Global, Bitget, Gate.ioand Huobi listed PEPE trading pairs two weeks ago, kicking off the token hype.\n\nSince the introduction of Dogecoin in 2013, memecoins have become a major part of the cryptocurrency world, making and ruining fortunes alike.

        "content": "Controversy Rises as Bitcoin Transaction Fees Continue Climb to Historical Highs\n\nControversy Rises as Bitcoin Transaction Fees Continue Climb to Historical Highs\n\nA recent phenomenon in the Bitcoin network has raised some concerns among users and observers. Some transactions are embedding images, texts, and other data into Bitcoin's blockchain using a technique called Ordinals Inscription. This process takes advantage of some updates to Bitcoin's code that allow for more flexibility and scalability, such as SegWit and Taproot.\n\nHowever, not everyone is happy with this trend. Some critics argue that the ordinals protocol is an attack on Bitcoin's fungibility, meaning that each bitcoin should be indistinguishable from another. They claim that by adding arbitrary data to the blockchain, ordinals make some bitcoins more valuable or desirable than others, depending on their content. For example, some ordinals inscriptions contain NFTs or digital art that could have a market value.\n\nAnother concern is that ordinals could pose a threat to Bitcoin's mission in El Salvador, where it is legal tender. Some fear that by filling up the blockchain with unnecessary data, ordinals could increase transaction fees and congestion, making Bitcoin less accessible and affordable for ordinary people.\n\nOrdinals are a controversial topic in the Bitcoin community, and there is no clear consensus on whether it is an improvement or an attack. Some see it as a way of expressing creativity and innovation, while others see it as a way of abusing and undermining Bitcoin's core principles."

The second largest cryptocurrency breached the US$2,000 resistance level on Saturday, but later fell back. Etherscan data showed the Ethereum Foundation moved about 15,000 Ether (US$30 million) to crypto exchange Kraken, a move that usually precedes sales.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses for the past 24 hours, with the exception of Litecoin, which edged up 0.71% to US$84.48, but traded down 4.71% for the week.\n\nXRP led the losers, falling 1.88% to US$0.4514 and moving down 4.31% for the week.\n\nPolkadot dropped 0.40% to US$5.64 and traded down 4.30% for the past seven days.

The practice is illegal in U.S. securities markets.\n\n\u201cWash trades make up a significant percentage of monthly transactions and are still largely driven by traders\u2019 farming points on the Blur marketplace,\u201d according to Forkast Labs NFT strategist Yehudah Petscher in a commentary on Saturday. He noted that \u201cwhile the total USD volume of global sales has been up in the past seven days, the Forkast 500, with wash sales removed, shows the NFT market actually losing value and is down over 2%.\u201d\n\nEquities\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong.

The inflation number is watched as a signal for whether the Federal Reserve may pause its interest rate hikes in June.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns rumble on that the U.S. government could default on its debt as early as June, with the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen again warning on Sunday that a constitutional crisis could be triggered if Congress failed to raise the debt ceiling in time, according to Reuters.\n\nThe potential default of the U.S. government could \u201cnegatively impact the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of a further risk-off approach by investors,\u201d said Mikkel Morch \u2013 Chairman and Non-Executive Director at crypto hedge fund ARK36 \u2013 in an emailed statement on Friday.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s next move on interest rates is due on June 14.

        "content": "What happened\n\nThe crypto market had a turbulent weekend, which has extended into trading on Monday. The drop has been caused by some insiders selling Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) transactions slowing to a crawl.\n\nAt 2:40 p.m. ET on Monday, Bitcoin has dropped 5.3% in the last 24 hours, Ethereum is down 5%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) has lost 7.8% of its value. A lot of altcoins are down by double digits, so this is the best corner of the market right now.\n\nSo what\n\nThe drop in Ethereum really started on Saturday when the Ethereum Foundation transferred nearly $30 million of tokens to the Kraken exchange, indicating they may sell tokens to fund operations, which the organization does periodically. This selling pressure is something traders were getting out in front of over the weekend, and that continues today.\n\nBitcoin fell in part because on Sunday, Binance temporarily closed withdrawals. The Bitcoin network was extremely congested, and on Sunday, there were 395,000 transactions waiting to be confirmed. According to Coindesk, the average transaction fee on the Bitcoin network jumped from $1.20 last week to $20 on Monday, which was the first time it hit that level since Bitcoin was over $60,000.\n\nDogecoin is one of the most emblematic memecoins or altcoins, and it's following its larger competitor today. But it's only down a small amount compared to the altcoins down double digits today.\n\nNow what\n\nThe last few months have seen a rapid recovery across cryptocurrency assets, and some of the drop today may simply be profit-taking. New tokens like Pepecoin have captured the market's attention and skyrocketed, but that euphoria rarely lasts.\n\nAt the same time, some of the biggest problems with crypto's wider adoption are being seen in just the last few days. Gas fees on Ethereum, which are the fees paid to complete a transaction, have gone up, and Bitcoin is facing the same problem. High fees make crypto almost unusable for anything but the largest transactions, and that's long been a criticism of the industry.\n\nI also think we need to be aware of what Binance does in crypto. When companies like FTX and Celsius froze withdrawals, it was a sign of future collapse. That hasn't happened at Binance, but as the largest crypto exchange, it's a critical cog to the industry.\n\nThe crypto industry seems to be in much better shape than it was a year ago before a lot of leverage was exposed in the ecosystem, but that doesn't mean there won't be similar drops in the market. That's what investors were concerned about, given the activities on Ethereum and Bitcoin. Whether they will have long-term impacts will take time to tell."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Bitcoin quadrant of Crypto Twitter was abuzz with concern on Sunday, as some users saw high transaction fees and a congested backlog of transactions as an attack on Bitcoin.\n\nThere are currently over 469,000 transactions waiting to be confirmed in Bitcoin\u2019s mempool as of this writing, according to mempool.space. Before transactions are added to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, transactions are sent to the network\u2019s mempool, where they wait to be selected by a Bitcoin miner and inserted into Bitcoin\u2019s next block.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees were also quite high, with high-priority transactions commanding a rate of 654 sat/vB, or around $26, according to mempool.space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe two metrics suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s network was especially clogged, but some thought it was the product of nefarious behavior, aimed at cutting off those that couldn\u2019t handle the uptick in transaction fees.\n\n\u201cHigh transaction fees are the chosen pain point by the attacker, probably to make [...] Bitcoin unusable for smaller players,\u201d claimed @proofofjogi on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cWe're in the then-they-fight-you-stage.\u201d\n\nFrom ordinals to DoS attack didn't take that much time. 3ish months, give or take couple days. We're in the then-they-fight-you-stage \u2014 iris.to/jogi (@proofofjogi) May 7, 2023\n\nThe notion that high transaction fees could be used as an \u201cattack vector\u201d toward Bitcoin was echoed by Bitcoin-maxi Dylan LeClair. But he claimed that driving up costs in the short term has a negligible impact on Bitcoin in the long run.\n\nPretty obvious attack vector for three later agencies with an infinite budget over the short-term. Changes nothing over the long term tho, miners thank \u2018em. \u2014 Dylan LeClair \ud83d\udfe0 (@DylanLeClair_) May 6, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne user on Twitter named @Toma_7_32 pointed out that clogging up Bitcoin\u2019s mempool mainly benefits miners, \u201c\u200b\u200bwho are having a blast\u201d while reaping the rewards associated with higher transaction fees, despite what some are labeling an \"'attack' on Bitcoin.\"\n\nIt appears that there's an \"attack\" on Bitcoin.\n\nThe Ordinal gang/ Big blockers? Are pushing random inscriptions and pay high fees.\n\nThey clog the mempool and increase overall fees to include a transaction in the block. What is unclear is, what is the purpose?\n\nThey are, at this\u2026 \u2014 Toma B (@Toma_7_32) May 7, 2023\n\nThe account claimed that it was only a matter of time before those flooding Bitcoin\u2019s mempool with transactions run out of money, making any impact on the network short-lived.\n\nStill, others attributed the uptick in transaction fees and Bitcoin\u2019s sizable backlog to Ordinals, a protocol used for minting NFT-like assets on Bitcoin. Called inscriptions, the total number of Bitcoin-based digital assets cruised past 4.3 million on Sunday, according to a Dune dashboard. Just last week, inscriptions totaled 2.5 million, based on Decrypt coverage.\n\nThe recent increase in inscriptions can be attributed to the growing popularity of BRC-20 tokens, which were originally pioneered as an experiment in March. Some exchanges like UniSat Wallet have created ways for people to trade these tokens built on top of Bitcoin, which bear a resemblance to ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.\n\nOn Sunday alone, UniSat Wallet had done over $9.3 million worth of inscriptions trading volume, as of this writing, according to another Dune dashboard. The figure coincided with roughly 7,500 transactions.\n\nWhile the chatter surrounding Ordinals and Bitcoin transaction fees grew more intense on Sunday, Bitcoin was largely flat. The coin was down roughly 0.1% at around 28,800, as of this writing, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAnd though some on Twitter vocalized concerns, others like Kashif Raza pushed back against the notion of Bitcoin being under attack, pointing to the fact that Ordinals is an innovation partly enabled by Bitcoin\u2019s taproot upgrade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe developers are using it to explore new possibilities that you can't stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what you call a free market.\u201d\n\nIs Brc-20 killing Bitcoin? Bitcoin is not under attack and it will never be.! Taproot upgrade enabled ordinals and once something is available. The developers are using it to explore new possibilities that you cant stop!

        "title": "The latest in crypto: Binance's bitcoin withdrawals, Coinbase, crypto mining tax - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo details several headlines emerging from the crypto space, including Binance's bitcoin withdrawals resuming after a second pause, Coinbase's assurances on its U.S. presence, and an energy tax the Biden administration is considering for crypto miners.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Crypto exchange Binance halted Bitcoin withdrawals earlier today. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, who has the details for us. Rachelle, how do we see some of the moves on the back of that?\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, so we're taking a look at some of the takeaways from the selling action that we've been seeing in some of these cryptos, especially Bitcoin. You mentioned Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, suspending those withdrawals. And that was due to too many pending transactions, according to CEO CZ. He tweeted that the problem was due to an unexpected surge in Bitcoin transaction fees, which had fluctuated an 18x from last month.\n\nHe also added in it was FUD, or fear, uncertainty, and doubt, also fueling this. But that skepticism and speculation about whether it was some of these big crypto whales selling their positions, that spread. So, of course, down went Bitcoin and dragged down other tokens with it on a day that already had a mixed picture in general for investors. Now, CEO CZ also tweeting, we're aware that some data are showing a large volume of outflows from Binance. This outflow is actually movements between Binance hot and cold wallets due to the BTC address adjustments.\n\nNow, if this had been just effective outflows, this would have marked the largest withdrawal in its history at over 162,000 Bitcoin, worth over $4.6 billion. Now, Julio Moreno, who's the head of research at CryptoQuant, he noted that these two transactions in question of 117,000 and 40,000 Bitcoin respectively were between Binance addresses. So putting those effective outflows closer to about 10,100 Bitcoin. So not as big of a deal as originally thought. But still, a lot of skepticism here.\n\nStory continues\n\n- There's a lot of skepticism there. Rachelle, let's also talk about what we're seeing take place at Coinbase because Coinbase shares were under a little bit of pressure today. The CEO there coming out, doubling down on criticisms of regulatory headwinds, also saying that they're not going to back down. They will gladly go face to face with the SEC. What are we learning there?\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, this is quite the turnaround. We had Coinbase saying they're not leaving the US. CEO Brian Armstrong walking back those earlier comments on the possibility of having Coinbase leave the US because of those regulatory headwinds. He told CNBC this morning, Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas. We're always going to have the US presence. But the US is a little bit behind right now.\n\nIn terms of examples you could look to, he praised the more thoughtful approaches, as he called them, in the EU for passing comprehensive crypto legislation, as well as the UK he said being incredibly welcoming as a reason why it's a hub that they've decided to serve as well. But, of course, SEC is still in the headlights there. Armstrong called the SEC an outlier in the way it's approaching crypto to curtail it rather than regulate it. But he says that these lawsuits-- you look for a silver lining here-- they offer a chance for more clarity, which will benefit the industry as a whole. Hopefully, get some answers on some of these different criteria.\n\n- Yeah. Brian Armstrong has had some pretty strong words for the SEC on the back of some concerns around that regulation. All right. What's the latest coming out of DC when it comes to crypto mining?\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, it's interesting because we thought we pretty much just had to look at the SEC in this. And we that the Biden administration was looking at not being fond of having people adding crypto to their 401(k). But now on the mining side, the Biden administration added the new Digital Asset Mining Energy. That's DAME. That's the excise tax. Its proposal to its budget last week.\n\nSo basically, what will happen is after a phase in period, crypto miners would face a tax equal to 30% of the cost of the electricity they use in crypto mining, essentially, the White House saying pay your fair share. Now, the White House estimates that in 2022, US crypto mining used about the same amount of electricity used to power the entire country's home computers or residential lighting. So to give you some context there. And, of course, the United States by far the biggest crypto mining country in the world. So this will really be a blow for crypto miners.\n\n- It will be something we will continue to track. All right. Rachelle, thanks so much."

        "title": "Does Bitcoin price risk losing $28K with BTC futures premium at 2-month lows? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "For the past 17 days, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a narrow 8.5% range, from $27,250 to $29,550, causing the 40-day volatility metric to drop below 40%. This wasn\u2019t restricted to cryptocurrencies, as the S&P 500 index\u2019s historical volatility reached 17%, its lowest level since December 2021.\n\nBut will $28,000 become the new resistance? Not according to the latest Bitcoin (BTC) futures and options data. Nevertheless, macroeconomic conditions remain the main driver for risk markets\u2019 price fluctuations in the near to medium terms.\n\nBTC price flattens as investors lose risk appetite\n\nA myriad of reasons could be given to explain the relatively small price oscillations in risk markets, including the expectation of a recession, investors unwilling to place new bets until the United States Federal Reserve ends its rate hikes, or increased demand (and focus) on fixed-income trades.\n\nThe problem is that no one can prove what has been causing investors to restrict their risk appetite and drive Bitcoin\u2019s price sideways. Many \u2014 including Warren Buffett, the multi-billionaire fund manager \u2014 fear that commercial real estate is a growing concern, which could trigger major turbulence ahead.\n\nWhile some believe that the U.S. debt ceiling discussion and the banking crisis could further cement the U.S. dollar\u2019s weakening, Buffett does not foresee alternatives. The finance mogul is a long-term critic of the precious metal gold, as his investment thesis prioritizes yield-providing assets.\n\nThe debt ceiling drama has caused Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to warn that a \u201csteep economic downturn\u201d would follow if Congress fails to act in the next few weeks.\n\nOn the one hand, the government is facing pressure to sustain economic activity and contain the banking crisis. Ultimately, increasing the debt limit would add liquidity to the markets, further triggering inflation.\n\nThis complex environment of inflation risks, an economic downturn and a weakening U.S. dollar might have caused investors to lose interest in risk assets and concentrate their bets on fixed-income trades as interest rates have moved above 5% per year.\n\nFor Bitcoin, an alarming sign would be a negative futures contract premium or increased costs for hedging using options. That\u2019s why investors should closely track those BTC derivatives metrics.\n\nBitcoin futures display weak demand from longs\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nBitcoin traders have been extremely cautious in the past two weeks. Even during the recent rally toward $29,850 on May 6, there was no surge in demand for leverage longs. Moreover, the subsequent 6.8% correction down to $27,800 has brought the BTC futures premium to its lowest level in two months at 1.5%.\n\nBitcoin options risk metric stood neutral\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nRelated: \u2018Bitcoin is not under attack:\u2019 BTC maxis allay fears of a DoS offensive\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, the options 25% delta skew has recently flirted with excessive optimism, as the protective put options were trading at a 7% discount on May 7 relative to similar neutral-to-bullish call options.\n\nStill, the trend quickly reverted, as the Bitcoin price tested levels below $28,000. Currently, this is a balanced risk appetite according to BTC options pricing, as the 25% delta skew indicator stands near 0%.\n\nBitcoin options and futures markets suggest that pro traders are less confident, favoring sideways trading. Thus, traders should not flip bearish due to weakening derivatives indicators.\n\nIn other words, if there was enough conviction that $28,000 would become resistance, one would expect a much higher appetite for risk-averse put options and a negative BTC futures premium, or \u201cbackwardation.\"\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "It\u2019s fair to say that Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) is not a fan of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nSherman has previously spoken extensively on the subject: \u201cCryptocurrencies are a crock [\u2026] They help criminals and terrorists [\u2026] they help startups perpetrate fraud [\u2026] undermine the dollar, encourage gambling for no social benefit [..] and are popular with guys who want to sit on their couch and tell their wives they are going to be millionaires.\u201d\n\nQuite why it\u2019s not popular with women who sit on the couch and tell their husbands they\u2019re going to be millionaires isn\u2019t clear. But let\u2019s be frank, misogyny comes in many forms.\n\nSherman is now upping his rhetoric. (Yes! Really!) And his assertion puts the con back into Congressman, designed as it is to advance a false, but damaging, narrative.\n\nQuote-tweeting The Bitcoin Conference, Sherman wrote that \u201c60 years ago, the late great Robert F. Kennedy #RFK went after tax evaders as U.S. attorney general. Today, his son is slated to speak at a conference for tax evaders.\u201d\n\nA conference for tax evaders.\n\nA sitting US Congressman just libeled me, and maybe you too.\n\nHis assertion is untrue and defamatory. I have attended The Bitcoin Conference, but I do not evade taxes. I have never evaded taxes. I do not intend to evade taxes. I may not love paying taxes, but I pay them anyway.\n\nYes, of course I\u2019m terrified of the IRS \u2014 who isn\u2019t, given the fact that you have to perjure yourself every time you file? \u2014 and that\u2019s certainly an incentive to file correctly.

Just like thousands of other crypto investors who pay their capital gains taxes.\n\nUnfortunately, and as we all know, politics is the real pay-to-play game.\n\nBrad Sherman is a politician who has done very well out of people who are threatened by cryptocurrencies and digital assets.\n\nIn 2021/22, the sector that donated most to Sherman was\u2026 the Securities & Investment industry, at $339,650.\n\nIn 2019/20, the sector that donated most to Sherman was\u2026 the Securities & Investment industry, at $246,965.\n\nIn 2017/18, the sector that donated most to Sherman was\u2026 the Securities & Investment industry, at $149,767.\n\nBefore this, it was mainly real estate. But then Sherman began attacking the crypto industry, and things changed.\n\nFrom 2019-2023, by the way, Sherman served as Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets\n\nWho else do we know who\u2019s supposed to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation, and who really has it in for crypto?\n\nAh.\n\nAnyway, here are a few facts.\n\nBrad Sherman says that The Bitcoin Conference is for tax evaders.\n\nI am an attendee of The Bitcoin Conference.\n\nI pay my taxes, and can prove it.\n\nSherman should be aware, given his position, that people who sell Bitcoin pay taxes.\n\nSherman\u2019s statement causes me reputational harm, since \u201ctax evaders\u201d are held in dubious esteem.\n\nUnfortunately, if the group of people being defamed is large enough, and you\u2019re not personally identifiable within that group, you can\u2019t sue. (Any attorneys in the audience who disagree, feel free to ping me.)\n\nBut I\u2019ll be watching Brad Sherman\u2019s words carefully in future.\n\nJust in case I get the chance to make him eat them.\n\nThis op-ed first appeared in Blockworks\u2019 newsletter.

        "title": "Up More Than 200% In 2023, This Bitcoin Mining Stock Is Still a Screaming Buy - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It may be hard to imagine, but the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 actually laid the foundation for an entire new industry -- Bitcoin mining. In the 14 years that Bitcoin has been in existence, a slew of companies have decided to base their entire business model on the cryptocurrency, and some have even decided to go public.\n\nToday, there are around 17 different companies that investors can choose from, but deciding which company is worthy of your investment requires a little more research. However, when we do some digging, there is one clear-cut Bitcoin miner deserving of an investment today -- Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%).\n\n1. Production\n\nSimply put, Riot is one of the top-producing Bitcoin miners. Since the beginning of 2022, the company has mined the second most Bitcoins in the industry with more than 8,200. This production is likely a reflection of its massive facilities in West Texas that are continuing to grow and bring miners online by the year.\n\nThere's also the efficiency and power with which Riot miners operate. Riot boasts the third-highest hash rate of all public mining companies. Measured in exahashes per second (EH/s), hash rate is essentially a statistic that helps quantify mining power. The higher the hash rate, the greater the ability to mine Bitcoin.\n\n2. Extremely efficient with low costs\n\nYou may have noticed that Riot was consistently in the top three of the statistics previously discussed, but it wasn't No. 1.\n\nHowever, CoreScientific (OTC: CORZ), the company with the most bitcoins produced since 2022 and the highest hash rate, sold just about all of its bitcoins to stay afloat. In fact, the majority of mining companies in 2022 not only sold off the majority of Bitcoins mined, but even dipped into reserves just to keep operations going.\n\nHowever, unlike the rest of the crowd, Riot was able to actually add bitcoins to its reserves while also keeping costs low. Riot is extremely efficient at mining, and its ability to continue to add bitcoins to its reserves in a tough market deserves recognition.\n\nExpanding on those low costs, the company spent on average around $17,900 per bitcoin mined -- the second lowest of all mining companies. Along with the benefits of efficiency and low costs, Riot also has a debt-free balance sheet, a feat the majority of its competitors fail to accomplish.\n\nFurthermore, Riot has a competitive advantage over some of its peers. Because its operations are based in Texas, Riot can benefit from a flexible energy grid.\n\nIt can be a little complex to understand, but essentially, when demand for energy is high, like it is during a heat wave, Riot can sell energy back to the grid for a higher profit than would have come out of dedicating resources to mining Bitcoin. When the same situation occurs in other states, miners are left with no option but to keep on mining while energy costs skyrocket, thus making it more difficult to realize profits.\n\nThanks to this unique business model, Riot was able to generate more than $27 million in power credits through voluntary power curtailments throughout the year.\n\n3. A promising future\n\nWhile the crypto winter of 2022 presented challenges for Riot, there were still some significant accomplishments made. Thanks to expansion of its Rockdale facility, Riot actually notched a new all-time high hash rate. Surprisingly, it was able to accomplish this while two of its buildings had to shut down due to severe winter storms.\n\nNow that 2022 and the woes of the Bitcoin bear market look to be in the rear-view mirror, Riot is gearing up for a potentially lucrative future. The company's Rockdale facility is still expanding, with an additional building set to be brought online soon. Progress continues to be made at the recently purchased Corsicana facility, which is expected to be energized by the end of the year.\n\nOnce fully operational, Riot expects to reach a hash rate of more than 12.5 EH/s, a significant jump from its current 7.9 EH/s.\n\nThe opportunity at hand\n\nWhile Riot may not be a leader in any one specific metric, it's difficult to ignore the company's well-rounded resume. It consistently has one of the highest rates of bitcoin production, on an extremely low-cost basis. When taking into account that the company is still expanding operations, it seems that Riot is in a position to gain even more market share by the end of the year.\n\nIt might be difficult to buy a stock after it has climbed more than 200% in the last five months, but Riot has the credentials to provide profits for the long haul. With its price still down more than 85% from its all-time high and the prospects of a Bitcoin bull market looming, consider me a buyer today."

        "title": "Here's Why Binance Is Integrating the Bitcoin Lightning Network - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Binance unveils plans to integrate Lightning Network for Bitcoin withdrawals.\n\nThe exchange paused Bitcoin withdrawals earlier, causing concerns.\n\nLightning Network helps scale the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBinance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, is grappling with changes happening on the Bitcoin network. Amid mounting issues, the exchange had to pause Bitcoin withdrawals and raise withdrawal fees.\n\nDue to other controversies surrounding Binance, the decision caused concern among users. However, Binance has since unveiled plans to use Lightning Network to solve all these problems.\n\nBinance Pauses Bitcoin Withdrawals, Unveils Lightning Plans\n\nThe revelation of Binance\u2019s plans to integrate the Lightning Network came amid a crisis for the exchange.\n\nOn Monday, May 8, Binance paused Bitcoin withdrawals for the second time in 12 hours, causing considerable concern among its users. At the same time, the exchange also significantly increased its fees for Bitcoin withdrawals.\n\nFollowing the decision, some users questioned whether Binance was in trouble and compared the issue to that of FTX. However, the exchange offered a different explanation for the problems: a steep rise in Bitcoin network transaction fees.\n\nOn Sunday, April 7, the average transaction fee on Bitcoin\u2019s network surged to a staggering $19.21.\n\nThis uptick in fees and network congestion coincides with a surge in BRC-20 tokens and inscriptions through Ordinals. This new technology enables users to mint NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain and trade fungible BRC-20 tokens.\n\nThere is little Binance can do to tackle the congestion issue on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. However, Binance can use a level 2 scaling solution like the Lightning Network to enable lower fees for user withdrawals.\n\nWhat Is the Lightning Network?\n\nThe Lightning Network is a second-layer solution that aims to resolve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability and high transaction fee issues. The network enables off-chain payment channels between users, without having to record every transaction on the main blockchain.\n\nSince Lightning Network transactions are off-chain, they do not require miner fees or compete for block space. This leads to significantly lower transaction fees compared to on-chain transactions.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOther exchanges, like OKX, already offer withdrawals using the Lightning Network.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network congestion issues are similar to those that Ethereum faced. In 2018, the NFT game CryptoKitties caused major congestion for the Ethereum network.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBinance\u2019s issues with Bitcoin withdrawals highlight the seriousness of Bitcoin\u2019s congestion. With the rise of the ordinals, Bitcoin could be facing similar problems that plagued Ethereum.\n\nFAQs\n\nDoes Binance use Bitcoin Lightning? Binance does not use the Bitcoin Lightning Network. However, the exchange announced plans to integrate the Lightning Network to improve transaction times and reduce fees for Bitcoin withdrawals. Can you buy Bitcoin Lightning Network? The Lightning Network is not a cryptocurrency that users can buy. It is a second-layer protocol built on the Bitcoin network to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions. However, users can use the Lightning Network to send and receive Bitcoin payments by opening a payment channel. Why am I unable to withdraw Bitcoin on Binance? Binance has briefly paused Bitcoin withdrawals in the past for several reasons, most recently because of a spike in trading fees. Any users experiencing difficulties with withdrawals should check official announcements or contact support. Other reasons for withdrawal issues may include insufficient account balance, incomplete security measures (e.g., address whitelisting, 2FA), or account restrictions due to incomplete KYC procedures. How do I unlock withdrawals from Binance? To unlock withdrawals from Binance, users should complete the KYC process, enable 2FA and possibly whitelist their withdrawal address (if necessary). Users should also monitor Binance\u2019s official announcements for withdrawal suspensions or maintenance periods.\n\nRead about Bitcoin NFTs that are driving up gas costs:\n\nBitcoin NFTs: What Makes BTC JPEGs so Extra-Ordinal?\n\nRead about the latest memecoin craze, the Pepe token:\n\nPEPE Jumps 132.31% as Binance, KuCoin List Controversial Token"

The leading digital asset was trading at around $27,350 at press time, down more than 5.5% in the past 24 hours.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the bearish sentiment, including the rising popularity of the PEPE meme coin, which reached a market capitalization of over $1 billion before losing steam over the weekend and losing half its value. The meme-inspired token attracted investors looking for quick profits and fun, but also raised concerns about market froth and speculation.\n\nMeanwhile, Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market value, also faced downward pressure, falling below $1,900 after holding above that level for most of the past week. ETH was trading at around $1,829 at press time, down 4.4% on a 24-hour basis.\n\nMost other major tokens also followed the downtrend on Monday, with XRP and Polygon's MATIC losing over 8% each."

Source: TradingView\n\nIt\u2019s been a wild ride for Bitcoin. In 2010, BTC was first traded for fiat currency, with an estimated value of less than a cent. Just a year later, the cryptocurrency hit parity with the US dollar for the first time.\n\nIn 2013, Bitcoin saw its first massive rally, soaring to a record high of roughly $1,200 in December. However, in 2014, BTC price crashed, experiencing no significant upside until 2017, when it hit a new all-time high of nearly $20,000, also in December. Just a year later, the number one crypto token saw a substantial correction, plummeting to as low as $3,200.\n\nIn 2020, BTC experiences another substantial price increase, closing out the year at $28,949. The cryptocurrency continued to rally in 2021, reaching its current all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021 following a significant bull run.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

The recent instability in the banking system has also further driven up the prices of these assets, leading some market observers to conclude that Bitcoin may in fact live up to its \u201cdigital gold\u201d promise and compete with gold for the safe haven asset status. Investors anticipating a sustained rally in both these assets are now able to generate enhanced returns by combining both exposures in a single product.\n\nOrbit Markets, the leading institutional liquidity provider in digital asset options, executed the trade with PI Digital, a regulated best-execution broker for high net worth individuals and institutional clients based in Switzerland. Antonio Pellizato, founding partner at PI Digital, commented \u201cWe strive to offer high-end bespoke services to our clients, always balancing performance and risk management in the most efficient ways. This hybrid asset product is a perfect fit for investors that have experience in traditional assets such as gold and are now starting to dip their toes into digital assets\u201d.\n\nThe derivative product references XAUT, the gold-backed token issued by Tether and allows investors to earn up to 40% APR. At maturity, the product will be settled in either USDT, XAUT or BTC as designated by OrBit.

        "title": "Would a U.S. Debt Default Really Send Crypto Soaring? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Just about everyone agrees that the U.S. government defaulting on its debt obligations in June would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order. For cryptocurrencies, the impact of a debt default would be far more consequential than the current banking crisis.\n\nAnd, yet, a number of prominent voices are actually suggesting that crypto might soar in the wake of a U.S. government default. Standard Chartered Bank, for example, is now suggesting that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) might soar by 70% as it becomes a safe-haven asset. But just how realistic is that prediction? Below are three possible scenarios for what might happen to crypto.\n\nWorst-case scenario\n\nLet's start off with a worst-case scenario, so we can understand how truly catastrophic a debt default would be. There would be an immediate backlash against every U.S. asset, including the U.S. dollar. And, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, there would likely be mass layoffs, payment failures across the economy, and a cratering of U.S. credit markets. Most likely, investors would immediately dump holdings of any risky U.S. cryptocurrency stocks, such as crypto mining stocks.\n\nBut what about cryptocurrencies themselves? Unlike in the current banking crisis, investors would not be able to pull money out of one place (i.e., the banking sector) and put it into another (i.e., the crypto sector). Debt instruments are not deposits. When a government defaults on its debt, all that's left is a worthless piece of paper backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of whoever issued it.\n\nThus, I don't see how there would be a massive influx of funds into crypto. Going forward, institutional investors might eventually ramp up their holdings of crypto as a further hedge against financial catastrophe, but there wouldn't be a sudden surge. More likely, investors would simply put their funds into the ultimate safe-haven asset: physical gold.\n\nMedium-case scenario\n\nA medium-case scenario is that the U.S. government \"technically\" defaults on its nearly $32 trillion in debt on June 1, but quickly finds some way to restructure the debt so it can be repaid. This would set into motion the ultimate \"too big to fail\" scenario -- once investors and lenders get a whiff of the chaos that might ensue after a debt default, they would surely work to provide some sort of liquidity backstop or short-term stabilization fund, just as we saw with the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nBut the damage would still be nearly irrevocable. Yes, the U.S. government would be able to issue new debt in the future, but at dramatically higher interest rates. Lenders that were part of the \"too big to fail\" coalition would probably also demand immediate austerity steps from the U.S. government, such as a commitment to scale back spending.\n\nBut that would be absolutely soul-crushing for the U.S. economy. And, again, I don't see any way that would really benefit crypto. Investors would likely turn to precious metals such as gold and silver, commodities, and other assets that have tangible value, such as real estate. Since crypto does not have any tangible value, I don't see how it would become a desirable investment in this new environment.\n\nIn fact, in a rising rate environment, crypto would become relatively less attractive than debt assets paying very high interest rates. This is a well-known phenomenon within the crypto sector that we've seen play out this year. Higher interest rates are bad for crypto, which is why Federal Reserve rate hikes are such a concern.\n\nBest-case scenario\n\nFinally, there's a best-case scenario. But it's only a \"best\" case on a relative basis. It would still be absolutely awful. The U.S. dollar would likely lose its current standing as the world's reserve currency, and it's almost impossible that Bitcoin would be able to fill the void this year. Most likely, we're talking about the Chinese yuan becoming the world's new reserve currency.\n\nWhere I do agree with Standard Chartered Bank is that there will be a set of winners within the crypto world and a set of losers. It's too simplistic to say all cryptos will go up, or all cryptos will go down. According to Standard Chartered Bank, a U.S. debt default would make a \"long Bitcoin, short Ethereum\" strategy optimal, given Bitcoin's much greater adoption as a form of payment and a store of value. But other cryptos -- as long as they are not linked to the U.S. economy -- might also get a bump in value.\n\nAt the end of the day...\n\nNobody would really benefit from a U.S. debt default. Thinking that a U.S. debt default is \"winnable\" is similar to thinking that a thermonuclear war carried out with tactical nukes is \"winnable.\"\n\nSo let's hope that U.S. politicians do the one thing that they are uniquely good at -- kicking the can down the road for someone else to deal with later. After a lot of last-minute political posturing and midnight sessions in Washington, Congressional leaders will likely emerge with an increase to the debt ceiling, freeing them up to continue spending until next year."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMeme token fever is sweeping through Bitcoin, as the market cap of tokens built on top of the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s blockchain approached $1 billion on Monday after ORDI\u2014the very first such token\u2014was listed on major exchanges.\n\nAccording to brc-20.io, which tracks the nascent market for tokens minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, the market cap of all BRC-20 tokens combined totals around $991 million, as of this writing. The market has surged in value, as well as number of tokens in circulation, over the last few days.\n\nShort for \"Bitcoin Request for Comment,\" BRC-20 is an experimental framework for building fungible tokens on Bitcoin using Ordinals, the protocol that enables people to mint NFT-like assets on Bitcoin called inscriptions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBRC-20 tokens have existed for two months. They were pioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo, who took inspiration from the ERC-20 token standard on Ethereum and launched a token called ORDI on March 8.\n\nSince then, Ordi has reached a market cap of around $400 million, according to brc-20.io. Other BRC-20 tokens like PEPE (a different token than the currently-hot Ethereum meme token of the same name), MEME, PIZA, and DOMO have followed suit as Bitcoin goes through the kind of meme coin mania that has gripped the wider crypto market in the past with Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and BONK.\n\nOn Monday, Ordi was listed for trading on Crypto.com and Gate.io, suggesting the experimental token is gaining mainstream adoption on cryptocurrency exchanges. As of this writing, the price of Ordi was $18.50 on Gate.io, a notable drop from its peak of $29.58 set earlier in the day.\n\nStill, the current price of Ordi represents a steep increase from its price just one week ago, when Ordi traded hands at $3.78 on May 1, according to brc-20.io.\n\nThe volatility of BRC-20 tokens highlights the emergent nature of the Ordinals space, as text-based inscriptions\u2014used to create and trade the tokens\u2014take over and image-based inscriptions become less common. Yesterday, over 399,000 inscriptions were text-based compared to 20 that were image-based, according to data from Dune.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA record number of daily inscriptions was recorded yesterday as well at over 400,000, pushing the total number of inscriptions made past 4.5 million since the Ordinals protocol took off in late January.\n\nThe popularity of BRC-20 tokens is having a noticeable impact on Bitcoin transactions, overall. On Sunday, 65% of Bitcoin transactions were related to BRC-20 tokens, according to another Dune dashboard, and leading crypto exchange Binance briefly halted Bitcoin withdrawals due to network congestion."

        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, has grown exponentially since its creation in 2009.\n\nAs more people become interested in investing in said currency, it\u2019s essential to understand the pros and cons of Bitcoin.\n\nAs such, we\u2019ll explore in this article the advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin investment and help you decide if it\u2019s the right choice for you \u2013 keep up-to-date with the latest bitcoin news.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin\n\n\u00b7 Decentralization and Financial Freedom\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of Bitcoin is its decentralized nature, meaning that it\u2019s not controlled by any central authority like a government or financial institution. Instead, it operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, thus allowing users to transact directly without intermediaries.\n\nThis level of financial freedom can be particularly appealing to those who distrust central banks and governments or reside in countries with unstable economies.\n\n\u00b7 Potential for High Returns\n\nMany investors are attracted to Bitcoin due to its prospective high revenues.\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, Bitcoin has historically outperformed traditional investments like stocks and bonds. However, past performance doesn\u2019t guarantee future results, and it\u2019s central to keep in mind that the market can change quickly.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u00b7 Anonymity and Privacy\n\nBitcoin transactions offer a level of inconspicuousness and confidentiality not available in traditional banking systems.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin isn\u2019t entirely anonymous, it provides a pseudonymous platform that can be used to protect personal information \u2013 this feature appeals to those who value their privacy or want to avoid potential surveillance from governments and other organizations.\n\n\u00b7 Low Transaction Fees\n\nCompared to traditional payment systems like credit cards and bank transfers, Bitcoin transactions typically incur lower fees. This can be particularly advantageous for businesses and individuals who engage in international trade, as it helps them save money on cross-border transactions.\n\n\u00b7 Accessibility and Inclusivity\n\nBitcoin is accessible to anyone with an Internet connection, making it a more inclusive financial system than traditional banking, which is particularly beneficial for those in developing countries, where many people don\u2019t have access to bank accounts or financial services.\n\nDisadvantages of Bitcoin\n\n\u00b7 Volatility and Risk\n\nThe most noteworthy disadvantage of investing in Bitcoin is its extreme price volatility \u2013 the value of Bitcoin can change rapidly, leading to sudden and dramatic gains or losses for investors, meaning that this level of risk may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with a low tolerance for risk or a short investment horizon.\n\n\u00b7 Regulatory Uncertainty\n\nAs Bitcoin gains popularity, supervisory authorities worldwide are grappling with how to deal with the cryptocurrency \u2013 this has eventually led to a lack of clear regulations and guidelines, thus cultivating reluctance among investors. In some cases, governments have banned or restricted the use of Bitcoin, which can negatively impact its value and acceptance.\n\n\u00b7 Environmental Impact\n\nBitcoin mining, the process of adding new transactions to the blockchain, consumes a significant amount of energy due to the computational power required, which has raised concerns about the environmental impact of the cryptocurrency, particularly in terms of its carbon footprint.\n\n\u00b7 Limited Acceptance\n\nWhile the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin as payment is growing, it is still not widely acknowledged, thus limiting the practical use of Bitcoin as a currency for everyday transactions and making it more of a speculative investment rather than a functional currency.\n\n\u00b7 Security Risks\n\nAlthough the blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin is secure, the digital wallets and exchanges used to store and trade Bitcoin can be vulnerable to hacking and other security risks.\n\nInvestors must take necessary precautions to protect their assets, such as using hardware wallets and enabling two-factor authentication.\n\nAdditionally, since transactions are irreversible, mistakes or unauthorized operations cannot be easily rectified, which adds to the potential risks associated with Bitcoin investment.\n\nIs Cryptocurrency Worth Investing In?\n\nDetermining whether cryptocurrency (specifically Bitcoin) is worth investing in depends on your individual goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy.\n\nWhile there are numerous advantages to investing in Bitcoin, such as decentralization, financial freedom, and the potential for high returns, it also comes with significant disadvantages, including volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and security risks, exactly as we have only just outlined.\n\nFor those with a high tolerance for risk and a long-term investment horizon, Bitcoin may provide an opportunity for diversification and potential growth. Then again, it\u2019s vital to understand that investing in cryptocurrency is not without its risks; furthermore, it\u2019s decisive to conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\nBefore committing to any investment, consider consulting with a financial advisor to ensure that you understand the risks involved and that your investment strategy aligns with your financial goals.\n\nMake sure you stay informed by keeping up with the latest crypto exchange news.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin offers both potential benefits and drawbacks \u2013 that much is clear, which is why understanding both the pros and cons of Bitcoin investment are crucial for making informed decisions about whether it\u2019s the right choice for you.\n\nBy carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages, you can determine if Bitcoin aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nSimply remember to keep up with the latest news and conduct thorough research when considering any investment, including cryptocurrency \u2013 it is absolutely key that you do this."

        "content": "Amid mixed sentiment on exchanges, cryptocurrencies are losing today. Bitcoin has retreated below $28,000. The Bitcoin network now has nearly 450,000 transactions still outstanding, and sentiment among risky assets was also weighed down by last Friday's surprisingly strong NFP report, which increased the chance of possible further Fed hikes and more difficult-to-manage inflation in the US. Along with Bitcoin, smaller cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cardano and Polygon also lost ground.\n\nMarket sentiment weakened as the world's largest exchange, Binance, froze BTC withdrawals for the second consecutive time citing technical problems;\n\nCoinbase (COIN.US) exchange is considering moving operations to the United Arab Emirates due to regulatory hurdles in the US;\n\nThe exchange's CEO stressed that the cryptocurrency market needs more capital investment to grow. The UAE is once again mentioned as a potential hub;\n\nAccording to Bloomberg reports, the Prime Minister of Liechtenstein has stated that he is open to investing state reserves in BTC.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the cost of a BTC transaction is about $19 although information from exchange users indicates that a significant portion of the routing is even several times more expensive. The reason for the nearly 450,000 transactions waiting to be processed on the network is probably due to the emergence of so-called Ordinals, which enable the creation of NFTs on the BTC blockchain. Due to this fact, network fees have risen to new peaks. Source: Ycharts\n\nBTC addresses have recently taken a dive; both new and active addresses are approaching their annual average (365 DMA).\n\nNew addresses are now at their lowest levels since January 1, 2023, and active addresses are at 1-year lows. All this despite record volumes and transaction fees. This shows that the expansion of the BTC network is still in question. Source: Glassnode\n\nAmong the group of long-term (blue) and short-term investors (red), BTC exchanges are mainly sent by short-term holders (about 90% to 95% of all receipts). What is noteworthy at the moment, of course, is the increase in profits of short-term investors in 2023, which makes the willingness to realize them even higher now. On the other hand, however, due to the limited supply in the hands of STH investors - the supply is naturally limited.... Source: Glassnode\n\nIsolating the share of profits of short-term investors (STH) from the total inflows to the exchanges, we see that since the beginning of January there have been two waves of profit realization by this group, peaking around the 60% level of the total. Within the current market, the second wave of profit realization by short-term holders coincides with the recent correction. Looking historically, a period of correction followed such heavy selling pressure in STH. Source: Glassnode\n\nSell-side levels\n\nBITCOIN, H4 interval. The price has settled below the SMA200 and SMA100 signaling weakness, the first support level may be the 23.6 Fiboancci retracement, of the upward wave from the fall of 2022 - at $27,400. A deeper decline could herald a bearish reaction, toward the 38.2 Fibo retracement, at $25,000. In a situation of extremes, the $21,500 level appears to be the last bastion of the bulls - it coincides with the 61.8 Fibo retracement and the price level of November 2022, before the collapse of FTX.

However, with approximately 368 days till the halving, there was still time for the fourth to follow the same pattern.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a notable revival in the Bitcoin market valuation growth since the unfortunate capitulation in 2022. For the unfamiliar, the Bitcoin demand and supply rate determine the market value.\n\nWith an indexed growth of 271% since the last halving, the market valuation had increased to $558 billion. This reflects an increase in the demand for the coin and its popularity over a longer period.\n\nBTC building up the hash\n\nBesides the indexed growth, one metric that has sustainably increased over the last halving period is the hashrate. The Bitcoin hashrate acts as a measure of computational power, and is used to determine the health, mining difficulty, and security within the Bitcoin network.\n\nAt press time, the hashrate had grown exponentially by 184.59% as it rose to 439.23 Exahash per second (EH/s).\n\nDespite the unfortunate events that rocked the crypto economy over the majority of the quarters in 2022, the realized profit/loss growth improved from the last halving.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nAt the time of writing, on-chain data showed that both realized profits and losses had increased by over 300%. This confirms the notion that demand had subsequently increased, and a lot of coins were used in transactions during the period.\n\nAs the halving nears, increased adoption could be bolstered, especially as institutions have been gradually embracing Bitcoin and allocating a portion of their treasury reserves to BTC. Additionally, more retail investors have also been recognizing the potential of Bitcoin as a potential investment tool."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining companies slow down on BTC sell-off while miners\u2019 revenue continues to increase.\n\nRetail investors stay optimistic.\n\nBitcoin miners have long been subjected to the cryptocurrency market\u2019s volatility. This has resulted in instances where miners have liquidated their holdings.\n\nBut in most cases, these miners have preferred to maintain their positions.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nStepping on the brakes\n\nHowever, public mining companies were observed to be consistent in their behavior. According to Blockridge\u2019s data, all mining companies sold 100% of their holdings, in the latter half of 2022.\n\nHowever, for the first time in over six months, the liquidation ratio decreased to below 100% in March, subsequently dropping further to 95% in April. Indicating that these companies had slowed down on selling off their BTC holdings.\n\nWell, the decline in sell-offs could be attributed to the fact that the companies\u2019 faith in BTC has been restored as the coin\u2019s price has soared over the last three months.\n\nDue to the increase in BTC\u2019s price, the revenue generated by miners also witnessed a spike.\n\nTalking about mining pools, Foundry Pool, one of the largest mining pools in the sector, was observed to be having a successful run in terms of mining blocks. According to btc.com\u2019s data, over the last six months, the pool managed to mine 8,060 blocks.\n\nThe mining companies and pools have just started to hold onto their BTC, and the retail investors show no sign of stopping their accumulation.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s data indicated that the number of addresses holding more than 0.1 coins has reached an all-time high.\n\nNo pressure\n\nAt the time of writing, the selling pressure on these investors was relatively low. According to data provided by Santiment, the 30-day MVRV ratio of BTC had turned negative.\n\nThis indicated that most short-term holders were not profitable and did not have an incentive to sell.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nOn the other hand, the Long/Short difference of BTC continued to increase, indicating that the majority of the addresses on the network were long-term holders of Bitcoin.\n\nDespite these factors, short positions on the network continued to increase. Consider the chart below, for instance."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and trading volume, sets another record with Block 788695 as transactions on its blockchain network spiral out of control.\n\nRecently, there has been an alarming rise in user transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, leading to network traffic and congestion. This has increased miner profitability significantly as transaction fees skyrocket to control the situation.\n\nIn an interesting development witnessed by the crypto community yesterday, miners were seen to have profited highly as transaction fees contained in Block 788695 surpassed the block subsidy. This will be the second occurrence for the Bitcoin network where transaction fees contained in a block are greater than the block subsidy.\n\nRelated Reading: BRC-20 Token Standard A Hotspot For New Memecoins As PEPE Soars\n\nBitcoin Block 788695 Sets Another Record\n\nAccording to Bitcoin mining data reports from Mempool, transaction fees contained in Block 788695 were seen to be greater than the Block subsidy. The reports show that 6.7 BTC in transaction fees were contained in Block 788695, greater than the 6.25 BTC block subsidy.\n\nThe last time this occurred was in 2017 when transaction fees contained in Block 500546 were reported to have surpassed the block subsidy. This phenomenon occurs primarily when the Bitcoin blockchain network receives exceedingly high network activity from user transactions.\n\nMiners are seen to profit highly from these congested blocks, which contain high user transactions compared to regular blocks. They create blocks by collecting transactions from the Mempool and adding them to a block, and once the blocks are filled, it goes through complex mathematical computations. The miner who solves the math problem is rewarded with transaction fees and the block subsidy.\n\nRelated Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Crypto Market Takes Another Hit\n\nThe block subsidy refers to the amount of new Bitcoin created or minted in each block. For each block successfully created, the miner is allowed to mint a fixed amount of new Bitcoin, which is based on the \u2018current issuance rate decided by the Bitcoin protocol.\u2019\n\nThe Bitcoin block subsidy amount is determined by an algorithm in its source code and starts at 50 BTC per block, which is split in half every four years. The split process of the block subsidy, otherwise known as BTC halving, has trickled down to 6.25 from it 50 BTC where it started and is expected to be split further in 2024.\n\nWhy Are BTC Transaction Fees On The Rise?\n\nThe jump in BTC transaction fees can be attributed to recent user activities on its blockchain network. For one, the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard on the Bitcoin network for seamlessly minting fungible tokens has gained increased popularity in the blockchain and crypto community.\n\nThe recent hype of tokens, including meme coins minted using the BRC-20 standard, has led to increased FOMO of users carrying out multiple token purchases and transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nBTC price opens on a negative on the daily chart timeframe | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nFeatured Image from Istock & Mempool, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s decentralised, permissionless, borderless nature means that anyone can start accepting payments from anyone anywhere in the world without incorporating in regulated jurisdictions and setting up bank accounts or merchant facilities. As the Bitcoin price rises and gets mainstream coverage, it has given rise to many scams targeting retail investors. As with any financial product, it pays to take the time to understand your investment and protect yourself from unscrupulous operators.\n\nPonzi/Pyramid Schemes\n\nOne particularly prevalent form of Bitcoin scam doing the rounds right now is the Ponzi or pyramid scheme. In a Ponzi scheme, the promoter promises investors a regular return on money they put into the scheme. The promoter will say money is being generated by investment or trading activities, but in reality the money is coming from new entrants into the scheme and no real investment exists. The Ponzi scheme eventually collapses when the original promoter walks away with all the money.\n\nPonzi schemes have some common features which taken together, indicate a less than legitimate operation. If you\u2019re considering putting money into a scheme with one or more of these features, it may be a scam:\n\nAnydesk\n\nA broker or advisor asking you to install any screen sharing software, particularly \u2018Any Desk\u2019 is almost certainly a scammer. There is no need for any genuine company to see your desktop screen and this is used as a ploy to retrieve your account information.\n\nBlockchain Scam\n\nAnyone claiming they have \u2018found\u2019 a large amount of cryptocurrency that belongs to you on the blockchain is almost certainly a scammer. This scam usually involves tricking someone into depositing a \u2018release fee\u2019 to withdraw your funds. Once you deposit the \u2018release fee\u2019, it gets stolen from you by the scammer.\n\nLarge account release scam\n\nOften scam sites will show you a large balance that they have run up through \u2018investing\u2019 or \u2018trading\u2019 an amount that you deposited to them. These sites will then make reasons for you to deposit more funds before they can release your funds. All extra deposits get stolen by the scammer.\n\nOffshore brokers/investment sites: Cryptocurrency is a volatile asset. There is, however, no such thing as free money. Companies promising big returns after a small deposit with little risk are highly likely to be scams.\n\nThe person recruiting you to the scheme is a trusted friend, family member or member of your community. Most members of a Ponzi scheme do not realise they\u2019re in a Ponzi scheme until it collapses.\n\nThe person recruiting you has already received some form of payment/s or returns. Members of a Ponzi scheme may indeed be receiving some form of payment/s at the time they try to recruit you \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean the scheme is legitimate.\n\nThey promise very high, often fixed rates of return. The average super fund in Australia returns around 10% per year. Ponzi schemes will usually promise much higher returns, up to 1% per day.\n\nThey offer benefits \u2013 such as compound interest \u2013 to entice you not to withdraw your money or Bitcoin. Ponzi schemes rely on keeping capital inside them to pay fake returns to their investors, who in turn will rely on these payments as \u2018proof\u2019 that the scheme is real, and recruit more members. Any scheme offering big financial inducements to keep your money inside it should be looked at very carefully.\n\nThe company is not registered with ASIC. Any company offering financial products and services to Australians must be registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. If the scheme is not registered, that is a warning sign. ASIC has more information on its website, including examples of Ponzi schemes, a list of registered companies, and a list of companies you should not deal with.\n\nGiveaway scams\n\nIf someone is asking you to send crypto and promising you will get more crypto sent back in return, this is a scam 100% of the time. Free crypto giveaways asking you to send an amount first do not exist. Even if you see these giveaways associated with well-known individuals, such as Elon Musk, this is still a scam designed to steal your funds.\n\nOther Scams\n\nOther forms of Bitcoin scam, similar to other financial scams, involve direct emails; malware downloads; and \u2018flipping\u2019 scams that encourage you to buy Bitcoin and immediately send it to someone with the promise of a significant sum of money in return. Forbes published an excellent article on Bitcoin scams which you can read here.\n\nBitcoin.com.au is a venue for the trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and other cryptocurrencies. We are not involved in any Digital Currency investment schemes. We have been working closely with regulatory bodies since our founding in 2013, and hope Digital Currency will soon be formally regulated in this country helping to better protect Australian Digital Currency users.\n\nExtra reading\n\nPlease go to this link to read about ASIC\u2019s top 10 ways to spot a crypto scam."

        "content": "Here we look at the different ways to withdraw bitcoin holdings into cold, hard cash\n\nDespite the downturn in the crypto market, the good news is that traders have a number of ways to get cash for their digital assets. If you\u2019re selling your bitcoin, then you\u2019ll want to understand many things like tax implications. You may owe a bundle if you\u2019re booking a capital gain, and the tax rate will depend on the holding period, among other things. In addition to paying with crypto directly, cashing out Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is something every crypto holder should know about. Here are the top ways to convert Bitcoin to cash fast, cheaply, easy and securely. Here are 8 ways to withdraw bitcoin in 2023.\n\nSell Bitcoin on and exchange for cash\n\nCrypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and more are the best options in order to turn your Bitcoin into cash. It is one of the best ways to withdraw bitcoin if you already use a centralized exchange and your crypto lives in a custodial wallet. Choose the coin and amount you\u2019d like to sell, agree to the rates and your cash will be available to you.\n\nOTC Brokerage Services\n\nOTC brokerage exchanges simply facilitate OTC buyers and sellers to transact on a peer-to-peer basis. The brokers specialize in large transactions placed via special platforms. Traders using these services have to adhere to certain verification procedures. There are also transactional limit requirements that vary from one exchange to another.\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) are kiosks that allow a person to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by using cash or debit cards. Some Bitcoin ATMs offer bidirectional functionality, enabling both the purchase of Bitcoin and the sale of Bitcoin for cash. These machines are available across the world. They provide a quick and easy way to receive cash for cryptocurrency without a bank account.\n\nCrypto debit card\n\nBitcoin debit cards (also called crypto debit cards) act like prepaid debit cards that can be loaded with cryptocurrency to make online and in-store purchases from merchants that don\u2019t accept cryptocurrencies. Crypto debit cards are typically connected to a centralized crypto exchange account and allow you to swipe the card for regular purchases. The exchange will convert your crypto to cash and use it for the purchase.\n\nBuy gift cards with bitcoin\n\nWhile technically not cash, converting crypto into gift cards usable practically anywhere is a close compromise. BitPay allows you to purchase gift cards with Bitcoin along with 15+ other top cryptocurrencies. Cash out crypto onto popular gift cards like prepaid Mastercards, Best Buy gift cards and more.\n\nPeer-to-peer crypto trading\n\nAs a decentralized currency, Bitcoin was originally designed as a peer-to-peer payment system. Sticking with those roots, using a peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchange allows you to sell your Bitcoin directly to another individual in exchange for cash.\n\nCrypto Wallet\n\nCryptocurrency wallets store users\u2019 public and private keys, while providing an easy-to-use interface to manage crypto balances. They also support cryptocurrency transfers through the blockchain. Some wallets even allow users to perform certain actions with their crypto assets, such as buying and selling or interacting with decentralised applications (dapps).\n\nCrypto swapping\n\nCrypto swapping allows you to instantly trade one cryptocurrency for another, with no crypto-to-fiat exchange required. Saving time and paying less in fees are obvious benefits, but it\u2019s far from the only reason users participate in swapping. Depending on which exchange you use, you may need to transfer or convert your cryptocurrency to another popular currency such as the stablecoin Tether, before finally converting to dollars.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "HMRC is considering introducing rules that would enable it to seize cryptocurrency from businesses that fail to pay their taxes.\n\nThe Government is mulling proposals that would give the tax agency powers to access online wallets as part of plans to modernise how tax is collected in the digital age.\n\nHMRC is already able to seize funds from bank accounts when individuals fail to pay tax under \u201cdirect recovery of debts\u201d powers, but is considering extending this to online payment accounts such as PayPal.\n\nA consultation document from HMRC raises the prospect that this could include businesses\u2019 cryptocurrency wallets if virtual currencies become a common way of making payments online.\n\nThe prospect of seizing cryptocurrencies from wallets would be seen as the latest crackdown on the sector, which has been accused of allowing money laundering and criminal activity. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been touted as ways to give owners control of their finances outside of government control.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency wallets that are operated by individuals can only be accessed by the owner, those at centralised online exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken could be subject to the rules.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are currently able to seize cryptocurrencies from these exchanges when they detect criminal activity.\n\n\u201cIf further regulation is brought in around digital currencies, it may be that cryptocurrency wallets may become a more popular method of paying for goods and services,\u201d a HMRC consultation document says.\n\nIt added that \u201cit was unclear how easy this would be due to the fluctuating value of cryptocurrency\u201d.\n\nThe Government said it expected to proceed and give HMRC powers to seize funds from digital wallets, although it is unclear if this will extend to cryptocurrencies.\n\nA HMRC spokesman said: \u201cThe proposals will help ensure HMRC\u2019s debt collection keeps pace with business practices. E-commerce means new business practices with fewer physical and owned assets held in the UK, which makes it harder for HMRC to collect unpaid taxes using existing powers.\n\n\u201cThe responses to this consultation will support the Government in undertaking additional analysis and engagement on the proposals.\n\n\u201cAll of HMRC\u2019s powers are balanced by safeguards, which should reassure taxpayers that powers are exercised proportionately and consistently.\u201d\n\nPolice have seized hundreds of millions of pounds in cryptocurrency linked to criminal operations, often auctioning it off.\n\nHMRC said recently that cryptocurrencies would be added to self assessment tax returns. It will mean an extra \u00a310m a year in capital gains taxes on profits that are not currently reported, forecasters estimate."

        "title": "Bitcoin Benefits From Emerging Bull Market, Can Big Eyes Coin Still Thrive Amongst Competition? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The beating that Bitcoin (BTC) took during the bear market seems to be slowly ending. 2023 has certainly been a better year for the original cryptocurrency, and although it took a tumble towards the end of 2022, Bitcoin has risen by 65% since the beginning of the year. The storm is over, and the sun is shining through, but will the end of the bear market be a rain-on Big Eyes Coin\u2019s (BIG) parade?\n\nBitcoin Bounces Back From Bear Market Blues\n\nIt is crucial to honor the coin that launched the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Since Bitcoin\u2019s creation in 2009, there has been an abundance of other cryptocurrencies entering the market. Over the past few years, Bitcoin has dominated and seen an enormous price increase. Bitcoin was barely about $500 around May of 2016, but it is now worth almost $28.5K.\n\nDespite being the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin still has many flaws. Although it is the most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, investing in it carries some risk because of the token\u2019s high volatility. Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped by more than 75% in 2022 compared to its peak. Although the volatility may deter some investors, Bitcoin has the advantage of being widely accepted as a form of payment for everyday transactions due to its immense popularity.\n\nA lot of popular sports figures have signed contracts accepting Bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. NBA star Andre Iguodala took to Twitter in early 2022 to announce he would be taking a portion of his salary in Bitcoin.\n\nDespite the hot and cold aspects of the market, it seems the clouds are clearing, and the sun is shining for Bitcoin this year. Already there has been a 65% increase in value for Bitcoin, and it seems that Bitcoin is leaving its market crash in the rearview mirror.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Due To Blossom\n\nWith its presale, the well-liked community-driven coin Big Eyes made recent history by earning over $35 million so far; as there is still a month left of the presale, things could make a drastic change. Big Eyes Coin is more than just an adorable crypto-conversant cat; Big Eyes wants to build something that any person can participate in; this cat cares about both people and the environment equally.\n\nAlthough it is refreshing to have a cryptocurrency pay so much close attention to the effects of climate change, so much so that it is choosing to dedicate five percent of all tokens to assisting charities with saving the oceans from pollution, at the end of the day, healthy fish makes for great cat food!\n\nWith the introduction of Loot Boxes, Big Eyes Coin has increased the intrigue surrounding presales. Presenting Big Eyes Coin as a means for people to win big, and as the end of the presale draws near, it isn\u2019t too late to purchase one before 3rd June. Alternatively, using code END300 before the deadline, potential investors can gain a healthy 300% ROI when buying $BIG!\n\nFor more on Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "A flustered user put out a desperate personal plea via Discord to return his $1.5 million in Bitcoin after he sent it to someone with the nickname \u201cjaredfromsubway\u201d by complete accident.\n\nOne holder of Bitcoin made a fatal mistake when transferring funds to another recipient by inputting the wrong address, sending $1.5 million worth of Bitcoin to a wallet of someone going by the pseudonym \u201cJared from Subway.\u201d\n\nUpon realizing the mistake the user took to a Discord server, which was not named in the report, and pleaded with \u201cJared\u201d to return his cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cJared from Subway, if you are reading this please help. I sent you by mistake tokens for about $1.5 m. Is there any possibility to get them back? Or my investors would kill me. Please help, Jared! I want to live,\u201d wrote the author of the mistake, before providing the details of the transactions.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nInternet reacts to $1.5 mil mistake involving \u201cJared from Subway\u201d\n\nWhile the situation went down on an undisclosed Discord server, Twitter user 0xCuteSocks made it public via their Tweet, breaking the situation down and providing links to the details of the multiple transactions that the user made.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nTwitter users in the replies were confused as to how exactly one makes such a fumble with such a high amount of money.\n\n\u201cHow do you make multiple accidental transactions to the wrong address? Like you should check after the first one,\u201d wrote one user.\n\n\u201cImagine not making a test transaction before sending $1.5mil,\u201d wrote another, equally baffled person.\n\nThe Discord user \u201ccamper\u201d who made the initial mistake has reportedly gotten through to \u201cJaredfromSubway\u201d and has had almost all of the money returned to them, with \u201cJared\u201d keeping around $50,000 for themselves.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nThis crypto horror story luckily had a happy ending, but not every story related to stolen crypto ends on such a note. In late March 2023, $8.9 million in crypto were stolen in the Safemoon hack, dragging Jake Paul back into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons."

        "content": "Daniel Risch, the Prime Minister of Liechtenstein, recently said that the country\u2019s government is considering accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as payment for official services.\n\nRisch says the plan calls for instant conversion of any cryptocurrency received for Swiss francs. This is done in order to reduce the dangers associated with exchange rates. As stated by the Prime Minister, the franc is the principality\u2019s official currency, and Bitcoin would not be accorded the same status as the franc, in an interview with the German daily Handelsblatt published on May 7.\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t provide many specifics about the plan, he did mention that a \u201cBitcoin payment option is coming.\u201d\n\nBoth Zug and Lugano in Switzerland have adopted a method of accepting Bitcoin payments that is somewhat similar to this one. There, local authorities have taken steps to legalize the use of Bitcoin payments for the payment of certain taxes and fees related to public services. Even McDonald\u2019s will take Bitcoin if you\u2019re in Lugano.\n\nLiechtenstein\u2019s crypto-friendly regulations\n\nIn addition, this is not the first time that news of Liechtenstein\u2019s crypto-friendly regulations has made headlines; it only marks the most recent instance.\n\nWith the passage of the Liechtenstein Blockchain Act in 2019, Liechtenstein became one of the first governments in the world to legislate specifically with cryptocurrencies.\n\nSince that time, a number of different enterprises with a focus on cryptocurrencies have established themselves in the country. Along with the other principalities in Switzerland that were previously mentioned, Liechtenstein has emerged as one of a select few financial centers in Europe that cater to the expanding market for cryptocurrency banking and investing services.\n\nCompanies such as the Liechtenstein Cryptoassets Exchange (LCX), which also has headquarters in Zug\u2019s \u201ccrypto valley,\u201d demonstrate how the Alpine country is modernizing its centuries-old banking industry.\n\nPlaces like Lichtenstein are progressively carving themselves into a specialized niche within the global cryptocurrency industry by combining a progressive legislative stance with their well-established financial services businesses."
