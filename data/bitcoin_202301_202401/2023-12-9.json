        "title": "Bitcoin: Do the Biggest Price Swings Happen on Weekends? - Investopedia",
        "content": "2022 Price Changes 2023 Price Changes 2022 Volume Changes 2023 Volume Changes Sunday -0.27% 0.53% 3.86% 12.21% Monday 0.02% 0.12% 47.65% 59.56% Tuesday -0.06% 0.97% 3.69% 2.75% Wednesday -0.27% 0.06% 2.93% 11.49% Thursday -0.20% -0.37% -0.42% 0.67% Friday -0.64% 0.48% 7.34% 1.72% Saturday -0.21% 0.13% -31.11% -36.60%\n\nBitcoin's average price changes (by midnight) in 2022 tended to drop from the previous midnight, but you'll notice that Friday night's change was the most significant drop, while Mondays was the most significant increase.\n\nIt should also be remembered that 2022 was often called a \"crypto winter\" as prices continued dropping through the year, somewhat mirroring the stock market, influenced by downward market pressures. Bitcoin's prices tend to follow stock market trends but are much more exaggerated in the short term.\n\nDuring 2023, all but Thursday's average price changes were positive by midnight. Average volume changes for both years demonstrate that volumes tended to drop on weekends as professional traders stopped trading. On Sundays, some traders were active, increasing volume from the night before. Mondays suggest professional traders got back to work as average trading volumes rose significantly and continued to rise throughout the work week.\n\nInterpreting the Price and Volume Data\n\nIt's difficult to discern if volume changes occur for reasons other than the days of the week professional traders are working, but it's a good bet that traders of all kinds are taking some time off during the weekend.\n\nIt also appears that bitcoin's market price doesn't change much (percentage-wise) regardless of the changes in trading volume\u2014but given the price of one bitcoin, even a price change of 0.5% could be a few hundred dollars.\n\nSo, what does all this mean for weekend traders? Less volume usually means lower liquidity and fewer opportunities in a market already touted as less liquid than other markets. But there are opportunities to make large profits on the weekends trading bitcoin.\n\nThe image below shows prices on Saturday, Dec. 9, 2023, in one-minute increments. On this particular Saturday, there were some opportunities for large profits from increases but also some significant drops that could cause massive losses. Between 8:30 and 9:10, the price dropped from about $44,200 to $43,760\u2014about $440 in less than 40 minutes. Several hours later, it nearly recovered, then dropped again by a few hundred dollars.\n\nTradingView\n\nA trader who can take advantage of movements like these could walk away with a significant profit, but the chances of losing a large amount are just as high.\n\n\n\nIs It Good To Trade Bitcoin on the Weekends? Bitcoin prices are as volatile on the weekend as during regular trading hours, but there is much less volume. Trading Bitcoin is always risky, but weekend trading adds more risk. If you can tolerate the risk and stick to your strategy, you could still trade profitably on weekends.\n\nCan I Trade Bitcoin on the Weekends? Cryptocurrency markets are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so you can trade bitcoin on the weekend.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Go Up on the Weekends? There is no pattern of price climbs on weekends, but prices can rise and fall significantly within minutes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCryptocurrency trading is an around-the-clock activity, giving you the flexibility to trade anytime. Weekends may be a good time to trade if you're busy throughout the week and don't have time to trade\u2014there are opportunities to profit.\n\nHowever, it is important to understand that trading volume was generally lower on weekends in 2022 and 2023 while prices continued rising and falling. Lower volume lessens liquidity in a market that is already somewhat low, and the cryptocurrency market can turn on a dime. But for the trader who can tolerate risks and stick with their strategy, Bitcoin weekend trading provides some excellent (but risky) opportunities.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s crypto winter appears to be thawing, bouncing to the $43,000-$46,000 range, up 159% from last December as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group. The upward move could be the start of a new cycle.\n\n\"There seems to be a lot of retail investor sentiment that's been sidelined. There hasn't been the hype and excitement that you've seen kind of mid to late cycle of the last crypto rally. So that actually gives us confidence that we're still a little bit early innings, that there's a lot of capital that has a cushion,\" John Todaro, senior research analyst, Needham & Company, told FOX Business.\n\nSeveral tailwinds are fueling the recent run. The Federal Reserve, which ends its final meeting of the year Wednesday, may start cutting rates in March 2024, according to forecasts tracked by the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool, which would be supportive of cryptos.\n\nPlus, BlackRock and Fidelity have pending applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds filed and under review with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There has been speculation at least one of these could win approval, which would mark the first Bitcoin ETF. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose firm oversees $9 trillion in assets, commented on rumors of a possible approval during an appearance of \"The Claman Countdown\" in October.\n\nFOX BUSINESS' LIVE CRYPTO PRICES: HERE\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BLK BLACKROCK INC. 809.12 -16.92 -2.05%\n\n\"I can't talk about the specifics of anything, I think it's just an example of the pent-up interest in crypto. We are hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto,\" Fink said. Investors, including Todaro are eyeing early January for a possible decision.\n\nMany investors who held Bitcoin when it was trading at the all-time high of $67,802.30 in November 2021, before sinking to the $16,000-$17,000 range, are gun shy, Todaro noted, but he sees a turning point.\n\n\"I think if Bitcoin crosses $50,000, which is a psychological point for a lot of retail investors, I think it starts to see a wave of some of that capital come back,\" he added.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % COIN COINBASE GLOBAL INC. 233.67 -18.06 -7.17%\n\nAdditionally, Todaro has a buy rating on crypto trading exchange Coinbase, which gets 90% of its revenue from retail customers. He notes interest in its app on the Apple store bottomed to No. 40 in February 2023 following the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all charges last month and is facing over 100 years in prison.\n\nFTX KING SAM BANKMAN-FRIED FOUND GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES\n\nSince it has recovered to No. 24 this month, further improvement would correlate with retail investors putting new money to work.\n\nTodaro has a $160 per-share price target on Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase\n\nNot everyone is a believer. Last week JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers during a hearing that cryptocurrencies are for criminals and if he had control of the U.S. government he would \"close it down.\""

        "title": "These Crypto Executives Think Bitcoin Could Be Worth $100,000 in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC -6.44%) currently trading near an 18-month high of $44,000, it's perhaps no surprise that a number of analysts and investors are now rushing to put out higher price targets for Bitcoin. The growing consensus is that Bitcoin could be on a trajectory to hit $100,000 next year.\n\nAs a result, top executives from within the crypto industry are now chiming in on Bitcoin's prospects for 2024, with many convinced Bitcoin could more than double in value within just 12 months. Let's take a closer look at why they think Bitcoin could be worth $100,000 in 2024.\n\nBitcoin at $100,000?\n\nOne of the most prominent voices calling for a rapid appreciation in the price of Bitcoin is Michael Saylor, chairman (and former CEO) of MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%). His company is one of the world's largest holders of Bitcoin, thanks to a Bitcoin accumulation strategy launched back in August 2020. As of Nov. 30, MicroStrategy held 174,530 Bitcoins acquired at an average price of $30,252. Given Bitcoin's current price of $44,000, MicroStrategy is now sitting on a profit of over $2 billion.\n\nWhile Saylor has not put out an official price target for Bitcoin in 2024, he recently appeared on CNBC in November and said Bitcoin had the potential to 10x in value. Further, in early December, he suggested on social media that \"One day we will all brag about buying five-figure Bitcoin.\" So, it seems safe to assume that he thinks Bitcoin will break through the $100,000 mark soon.\n\nAnd Saylor is not alone. Other crypto executives also think Bitcoin is headed to $100,000 and beyond. Crypto financial services firm Matrixport recently suggested Bitcoin could be headed to $125,000 by the end of 2024. And Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, suggested Bitcoin might hit $100,000 before the next halving, currently scheduled for April 2024.\n\nWall Street joins the Bitcoin party\n\nIt's one thing for crypto executives to be talking up the price of Bitcoin. But it's another thing entirely when prominent voices within the mainstream financial industry are also pondering the prospect of Bitcoin at $100,000. In April, Standard Chartered Bank put out a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin and, in November, reiterated its bullish stance.\n\nAnd don't forget about the prominent institutional investors who are long-term bullish on Bitcoin. One of the leading voices here is Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. Her firm originally put out a $1 million price target for Bitcoin and followed that up with a revised $1.48 million price target for the year 2030. Bitcoin would likely have to soar in value next year to hit that lofty target.\n\nWhy $100,000?\n\nAt this point, it's only natural to ask: Why are so many people convinced that Bitcoin will soar past the $100,000 mark next year? If you analyze the various predictions made by the crypto industry and Wall Street executives, there appear to be two major catalysts.\n\nThe first catalyst is the imminent arrival of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market. A handful of Wall Street firms have already filed exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the current consensus is that approval will come sometime in early 2024. When that happens, a tsunami of new institutional investor money could flood into Bitcoin.\n\nThe second catalyst is the Bitcoin halving, now scheduled for April 2024. This event, which results in the reward paid out to Bitcoin miners being cut in half, takes place only once every four years. In three previous halving cycles, the price of Bitcoin has soared, so the excitement around this next halving cycle is almost palpable. Of course, just remember that past performance is no guarantee of future performance.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nWhile all lights seem to be flashing green right now, keep in mind that a lot could potentially go wrong on the path to $100,000. For one, the SEC might decide that it will never approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. That could be disastrous, given how important the Bitcoin ETF narrative has become. Moreover, the Bitcoin halving could turn out to be a dud, and that, too, would put a serious dent in any bullish Bitcoin forecast.\n\nTaking all of that into account, Bitcoin has a real opportunity to double in value in 2024. Right now, $100,000 seems like a reasonable price target, especially given that Bitcoin has already more than doubled in value this year. As a result, I remain long-term bullish on Bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin is the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency asset class. In a November 10 Barchart article highlighting Bitcoin, I wrote:\n\nThe bullish technical break in October 2023 could lead to much higher prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies as investors, trend-following traders, and speculators flock to the asset class. However, the historical trading pattern shows that the higher they rise, the greater the odds of another price implosion. Like a game of speculative musical chairs, when the bullish music stops, buyers become sellers, and prices can plunge.\n\nLast week, Bitcoin rose to over $44,000 per token, the highest level since April 2022. With the leading crypto at high 2023 highs late in the year, a speculative frenzy could take Bitcoin to higher highs over the coming weeks.\n\nThe next technical resistance level is at over $48,000 per token\n\nBitcoin is steaming toward the March 2022 high, the technical resistance area on the long-term chart.\n\nAs the chart dating back to 2010 shows, Bitcoin\u2019s next upside target is $48,187.21, the March 2022 high. Above there, Bitcoin faces resistance at $59,043.43, the December 2021 peak, and $68,906.48, the November 2021 record high.\n\nEthereum rises to a new 2023 high- The technical target is above $3,500 per token\n\nEthereum, the second-leading cryptocurrency, has followed Bitcoin higher, moving to a new 2023 high.\n\nThe chart illustrates at a high of over $2,400 per token on December 8, 2023, Ethereum is moving towards the $3,579.866 peak. Ethereum\u2019s all-time high was $4,865.426 in November 2021.\n\nAt the late 2021 highs, the cryptocurrency asset class\u2019s market cap rose to the $3 trillion level. On December 8, it was over $1.6 trillion. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap was 53.7% of the total, while Ethereum\u2019s was 17.1%. The two leaders had 70.8% of the total market cap. Bitcoin\u2019s was over $860 billion, with Ethereum\u2019s near $275 billion. Tether (USDT) had around a $90 billion market cap and was the third most valuable crypto. However, Tether\u2019s market cap was one-third of second place Ethereum\u2019s, indicating the asset class\u2019s significant value concentration in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nRIOT has a great year with more upside potential\n\nRiot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) is a Bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure company. At the $15.83 per share level on December 8, RIOT had a market cap of over $3.269 billion. RIOT is a highly liquid stock, trading an average of over 26.28 million shares daily.\n\nThe chart shows that after reaching a $3.25 low in late December 2022, RIOT shares have rallied 387% over the past year. Technical resistance is at the July 10, 2023, $20.65 per share, and RIOT traded to $79.50 in February 2021. RIOT could have lots of upside if the rally in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues.\n\nMARA is in a bullish trend\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings Inc. (MARA) also mines cryptocurrencies with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets. At $16.78 per share, MARA\u2019s market cap was around $3.735 billion, with average daily trading volume at nearly 49 million shares.\n\nWhen Bitcoin reached its bottom, MARA reached a $3.11 per share low in late 2022. At $16.78 on December 8, MARA was over 439.5% higher. Technical resistance is at the July 2023 $19.88 high. In November 2021, when Bitcoin peaked, MARA traded to $83.45 per share. Like RIOT, MARA will track Bitcoin higher or lower over the coming weeks and months.\n\nBITQ moves towards a critical resistance level\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) tracks the performance of companies involved in blockchain and the digital currency asset class. At $10.18 per share on December 8, BITQ had around $115.3 million in assets under management. The ETF trades an average of more than 180,000 shares daily and charges a 0.85% management fee.\n\nAfter trading to a $3.20 low in late December 2022, BITQ has more than tripled over the past year. Technical resistance is at the July $11.34 high. BITQ traded to a record high of $35.68 in November 2021.\n\nThe trend is always your best friend in markets. Cryptocurrencies, a highly speculative asset class, have a history of boom-and-bust price action. They are back in boom mode after reaching significant bottoms in late 2022. If Bitcoin and Ethereum are moving towards a challenge of the November 2021 record highs, expect RIOT, MARA, and BITQ to follow on the upside. These liquid stocks are regulated and do not require computer wallets or holding cryptos on platforms.\n\nThe upside potential comes with commensurate risks. Only invest capital you are willing to lose in the cryptocurrency asset class, as the oversized reward potential involves the risk of a total loss.\n\nMore Crypto News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrew Hecht did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Prediction: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Trillion in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -6.44%) has been a massive winner in 2023. The world's leading digital asset has skyrocketed 163% (as of Dec. 7).\n\nBitcoin's current market cap is $847 billion. Naturally, investors have their sights set on the coveted $1 trillion mark. Perhaps this will put the top cryptocurrency on the radar of more of the financial and investment community.\n\nHitting this number translates to an 18% gain from today's value. Not only do I think Bitcoin will hit this mark sometime in 2024, but I think $1 trillion could happen before the end of 2023.\n\nIs there a better environment for Bitcoin?\n\nThe current situation could not be any better for Bitcoin. Here's why.\n\nIn April 2024, Bitcoin will undergo what's known as a halving. This is an event that happens roughly every four years, and it cuts the rate at which new Bitcoin supply enters the market.\n\nPast halving events have been extremely bullish for this cryptocurrency, both before and after they happen. We are seeing this right now, with strong momentum pushing up Bitcoin's price by 25% in the last month.\n\nThe recent price action might also be a direct result of optimism building for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) to finally hit the market. BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, Invesco, and WisdomTree, among others, have all filed applications to introduce this product. The Securities and Exchange Commission could hand out approvals at the start of next year.\n\nThere is certainly a lot of anticipation for this. Spot ETFs would essentially legitimize Bitcoin in the financial services industry. Plus, they could open up lots of fresh capital from people who want exposure to Bitcoin with a product that has been approved by regulators and is easy to trade.\n\nWe've seen inflation start to come down in recent months. And to the Federal Reserve, this could be viewed as a clear signal that its effort to curb rising prices across the economy by aggressively hiking interest rates is working. This could prompt the central bank to cut rates sometime in 2024. This would be another bullish catalyst for a risky asset like Bitcoin.\n\nThis is a great environment for Bitcoin to shine.\n\nThink about the long term\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in what's happening right now and what the next several months will hold. But to be clear, no one should buy Bitcoin unless they plan to hold it for the next five or 10 years. This is a long-term investment and should be treated as such.\n\nBesides the catalysts I mentioned above, why else would anyone want to own Bitcoin? I believe it comes down to one critical reason.\n\nA conversation about Bitcoin centers on the fact that it has absolute scarcity. There can be only 21 million coins. This is based on a fixed supply cap that is set in Bitcoin's software. This number could change, but only if the majority of nodes accept it. Many experts believe this is extremely unlikely.\n\nSo we have an asset with a fixed supply that is going up against a world in which fiat, or government-backed, currencies are constantly increasing in number. Bitcoin can be viewed as an attractive store of value.\n\nAlthough, like a growth tech stock, it's volatile, which might be hard for some folks to handle. Bitcoin has done a magnificent job at increasing its holders' purchasing power over the years.\n\nI view a $1 trillion market cap as extremely likely. But looking out even further, Bitcoin's value could be much higher than that."

        "title": "How to Analyze Cryptocurrency: The Basics - Investopedia",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency investing can be a great way to diversify investments, but figuring out which cryptocurrency is suitable and which isn\u2019t can be challenging. To make an informed investment decision, it is important to know how to analyze cryptocurrencies.\n\nKey Takeaways Investing in cryptocurrency requires a basic understanding of what it is.\n\nWhen choosing a crypto, you should learn about the project and what its vision is.\n\nCryptocurrency analysis is similar to fundamental analysis of stocks.\n\nIf a project makes promises but doesn't discuss how it is solving a problem, it might not be a good investment.\n\n\n\n1. Review the White Paper\n\nMost crypto projects provide a white paper, which helps define the objectives and technical details about the blockchain and its cryptocurrency's role. True white papers contain terms and language data scientists, programmers, and developers understand. For instance, Solana has a whitepaper that describes how the blockchain will work and what the token is used for.\n\nCybertruck's white paper, on the other hand, does not\u2014it is a flashy website that talks about the potential for building a community. A disclaimer at the bottom of the webpage states, \"$CYBERTRUCK is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless.\"\n\nA cryptocurrency with utility or a reason to exist should have a white paper that clearly defines the project's goals, how it will achieve them, and how the cryptocurrency will function. Legitimate white papers define a problem being solved with the blockchain and token, and this problem and solution should be crystal clear to investors.\n\n2. Research the Team\n\nCryptocurrencies are typically created by a team of founders and software developers who help create the solution to a problem. To better understand how a project could perform, you should research the professional experience of the project team.\n\nThis may include reviewing LinkedIn profiles to learn about the professional background of any of the technical or leadership staff and the previous projects that the team members have launched. Also, the \u201cAbout\u201d page on any cryptocurrency\u2019s website should clearly articulate who is helping build the project and what their expertise entails.\n\nA red flag would be a team of anonymous founders or developers who don\u2019t reveal their identity publicly or an inexperienced team that has not built or scaled any projects in the past.\n\n3. Learn About the Leadership\n\nCrypto projects with the potential to make a difference have a clearly defined executive team that handles the execution, financials, and marketing. Learning more about who is leading a cryptocurrency team can give insight into the probability of success for a project.\n\nHere are a few questions to ask when researching a crypto project's leadership:\n\nDo they have a history of successful leadership positions?\n\nAre they reputable/well-known leaders?\n\nDo they have a history in the crypto industry? Is it good or bad?\n\nAre they public-facing or anonymous?\n\nWhile some projects with anonymous founders have had success, such as Bitcoin, there are others with bad intentions. The cryptocurrency is likely not legitimate if the project's leadership is sketchy or if it avoids important topics.\n\n4. Get to Know the Community\n\nMost cryptocurrencies are community-driven projects that typically require a strong, supportive community to grow. Learning about a cryptocurrency's community can help you gauge whether a project will succeed or if it is pure hype and speculation.\n\nJoining the community's Discord or Telegram channel can help you learn more about it, as well as get your questions about the project itself answered. If a large community base is well-organized and frequently promotes the project, it could be a sign that a cryptocurrency has the potential to grow. Communities should be discussing issues with the blockchain and improvements that could be made or have other similar discussions\u2014in addition to the regular conversations that might occur between people with similar interests. If all you find is hype and pumping, it is a good bet that the cryptocurrency project is not legitimate.\n\n5. Understand the Technology\n\nCryptocurrencies are a new concept built on distributed systems that have existed for decades. The original intent behind them was to remove human involvement (and thus corruption, mistakes, and third-party profits) from financial systems. If you can gain even a partial understanding of how blockchains work and can be used to solve problems, you'll have an upper hand in deciding whether a cryptocurrency is worth investing in.\n\nHowever, you don't need to know how to program or maintain a blockchain\u2014but learning what a token is, what the blockchain does, how it is maintained, what is stored on a blockchain, and how the blockchain is interacted with by users is essential for would-be investors. Otherwise, you're only speculating on prices and hoping the coin becomes popular.\n\n6. Understand the Vision\n\nCryptocurrencies should have a clear vision of their goals, with a road map that estimates how they will get there. This should be readily available in the white paper and on its website. The vision of a crypto project should give enough details for you to understand what problems it is solving and the potential user base.\n\nFor example, if a website has statements like \u201ccryptocurrency is the future\u201d but does not define or articulate a clear vision for how the cryptocurrency solves a specific user problem, it is a red flag.\n\n7. Review the Road Map\n\nThe road map for a cryptocurrency project is a timeline of events that shows its expected progress. Typically shown on a line graph, the road map should have clear and concise milestones broken down on a quarterly basis, all moving the project toward a predefined set of goals.\n\nThe road map may be available in the white paper, though most crypto project timelines are ever-changing and are listed on a website. If there is no defined road map, or if the milestones are too generic (or based on money raised or earned), it is a red flag.\n\n8. Learn the Tokenomics\n\nThe term \"tokenomics\" refers to the distribution, circulation, and total supply of a given cryptocurrency. This is important, as it affects the overall price of a cryptocurrency over time. Similar to shares of stock in a publicly traded company, the price of a given cryptocurrency reflects supply and demand. The more shares there are, the more demand there needs to be to increase the price.\n\nHere are three important data points to review before investing in any cryptocurrency:\n\nCirculating supply : The cryptocurrency currently in the market\n\n: The cryptocurrency currently in the market Total supply : The total amount of cryptocurrency issued, including those that have been removed from circulation\n\n: The total amount of cryptocurrency issued, including those that have been removed from circulation Maximum supply: The maximum amount of tokens that will ever be issued\n\nAll three of these statistics can greatly affect the price of a given cryptocurrency, so understanding supply is essential for cryptocurrency investors.\n\nSome cryptocurrency projects use uneven token distribution methods to try and influence prices. Reviewing the token unlock schedule can help you understand how the tokens will be distributed and to whom they will go. Projects that give the founders a large portion of tokens at release should be viewed with a skeptic's glasses.\n\n9. Review the Data\n\nCryptocurrency prices are known to swing up and down wildly. One reason for these wild swings is that investors do not want to be left out of the next big price jump, nor do they want to be left holding a cryptocurrency that has dropped significantly in price (unless they are very bullish about it).\n\nUsers influence prices as well, paying for cryptocurrency at the going market rate, but this activity is much less significant an influence than investing and trading.\n\nCryptocurrency prices also react, sometimes explosively, to news and events because of investor anticipation. For example, Bitcoin halvings are believed by many investors to be events that increase its price because there is a reduction in the rate at which new coins are introduced. However, what's really causing the price changes is demand because investors associate the event with a price jump\u2014so they start buying more, causing the price to increase.\n\nThe price of the cryptocurrency you're reviewing should follow the same trends other cryptocurrencies have because traders and investors will generally treat them the same as they do other investments. Prices that seem out of place should raise an eyebrow.\n\nWhat Are Cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies not controlled or supported by any central authority like banks. Instead, transactions and ownership data are stored on a blockchain.\n\nIs Investing in Crypto Safe? Investing in cryptocurrency is a speculative investment. While it is not necessarily considered a \u201csafe investment,\u201d it can be a viable option for portfolio diversification. Cryptocurrency can be a smaller part of a larger investment portfolio, characterized as a risky asset with more volatility than most investments.\n\n\n\nWhat Are the Popular Cryptocurrencies? There are many popular cryptocurrencies on the market, but the simplest way to gauge the popularity of a given cryptocurrency is market capitalization. This is the measurement of the total value of cryptocurrency based on the current price and circulating supply of tokens. Here are some popular cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap (as of December 2023): Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Tether (USDT) BNB (BNB) XRP\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA cryptocurrency analysis involves examining all the available information about a digital asset. Understanding and researching the topic helps you to determine why it's priced the way it is and whether it is worth investing in.\n\n\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

The database is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nBitcoin's vulnerability listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) System. Source: CVE Records.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network vulnerability is currently under analysis. As one potential impact, it could result in large amounts of non-transactional data spamming the blockchain, potentially increasing network size, and adversely affecting performance and fees.\n\nOn the NVD\u2019s website, a recent post from Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr on X (formerly Twitter) is featured as an information resource. Dashjr alleges that inscriptions exploit a Bitcoin Core vulnerability to spam the network. \"I guess it\u2019s like receiving junk mail that you have to sift through everyday to find the ones that are your contacts. It slows down the process,\u201d a user wrote in the discussion.\n\nWhy is it relevant to Ordinals?\n\nAn inscription consists of embedding additional data to a specific satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin). This data can be anything digital, like an image, text, or other forms of media. Each time data is added onto a satoshi, it becomes a permanent part of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEven though data embedding has been part of the Bitcoin protocol for some time, its popularity only increased with the advent of Ordinals in late 2022, a protocol that allowed unique digital arts to be directly embedded into Bitcoin transactions, similar to how nonfungible tokens (NFTs) run on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe volume of Ordinals transactions clogged Bitcoin\u2019s network several times during 2023, resulting in more competition to confirm transactions, thus increasing fees and slowing processing time.\n\nIf the bug is patched, it can potentially restrict Ordinals inscriptions on the network. Asked if Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens \u201cwould stop being a thing\u201d if the vulnerability was fixed, Dashjr replied, \"Correct.\" However, existing inscriptions would remain intact due to the immutability of the network.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

        "title": "8 Crypto to consider buying now for the next bull run in 2024 - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Spotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Bitcoin recently hitting $44K for the first time since April 2022, time is running out to buy crypto\u2019s cheap before the bull run sends prices soaring. However, identifying the projects with the highest potential is challenging. We\u2019ve considered tokenomics, use cases, market trends, hype, and partnerships to provide the best eight cryptos to buy now. Let\u2019s explore each of them.Our top pick for the best crypto to buy ahead of the next bull run is Bitcoin ETF Token . Typically, Bitcoin-related tokens perform well alongside the market leader. However, the newly launched presale Bitcoin ETF Token offers a one-of-a-kind use case and is closely tied to the widely anticipated Bitcoin ETF approvals.The project features multiple tools to reward holders as the Bitcoin ETFs are approved. The most hyped is its deflationary mechanism, which drives scarcity and fear of missing out (FOMO) into the project, potentially skyrocketing its price.Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s burn mechanism is two-fold. First, it has allocated 25% of its total supply to be burned across five key Bitcoin ETF Milestones. Second, it features a 5% burn tax on transactions, which will be reduced by 1% at each milestone.It also boasts a staking mechanism which currently offers a 97% APY. Presale buyers can start staking and compounding their investment immediately, but they must be quick as the rewards decrease as more people stake tokens.The project also offers Bitcoin ETF alerts via its website, updating users on the latest industry news. This will help foster and retain an active and engaged community.Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s presale is quickly nearing its $4.9 million hard cap after raising $2.7 million in one month. Meme Kombat is a revolutionary meme coin-cross GambleFi token, providing an innovative use case, robust tokenomics, and a position at the cusp of two of crypto's most prominent trends.The project enables users to gamble on AI-generated battles between meme coin characters. It boasts numerous game modes, massive community rewards, and traditional odds mechanics, making for a truly immersive gambling experience.Essentially, this use case adds a gamified meme coin allure to the exciting crypto casino trend, which has seen significant success recently.Users must wager with the $MK token, creating a steady and predictable demand stream to help the price grow.On the other hand, much of the supply will be locked up in the project\u2019s lucrative staking mechanism. Currently, stakers can garner a 333% APY, this will decrease as the staking pool grows, similar to Bitcoin ETF Token.Another massively bullish factor is the project\u2019s security. It features a doxxed team, with its founder\u2019s details available on its website. Furthermore, blockchain security firm Coinsult recently conducted a smart contract audit , which found the $MK token is secure and not at risk of hacks or exploits.Investors can buy the Meme Kombat presale for $0.225, but they must hurry because its price will rise in just over one day.Avalanche is a scalable and decentralised layer 1 blockchain boasting a vast ecosystem. The project focuses mainly on DeFi and crypto gaming, two of crypto's most promising use cases.The AVAX price has recently begun a solid upward trajectory, currently trading at $26.26 and up 25% this week. As such, it has fared as the best-performing top 10 crypto, ahead of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and others, indicating a growing bullish narrative around the project.Moreover, AVAX has surged over 100% this month, solidifying its current trajectory. That said, there remains significant room for growth in the bull run, with its market cap at less than $10 billion.Avalanche could climb significantly higher in the upcoming bull run because its ecosystem is arguably expanding faster than any other. The project has seen adoption from leading financial institutions like JP Morgan and Citi. Meanwhile, tier-one games like Shrapnel, Blitz, and Off The Grid are all building on the network.This is significantly bullish for the AVAX coin since it is used for staking and will be the primary currency to transfer value and pay network transaction fees, providing significant demand as adoption grows.After a meteoric rise to become the third largest meme coin in the recent bear market, Pepe suffered a drawn-out pullback, dropping from highs of $0.000004354 on 6 May to $0.0000006446 in October.However, a renewed excitement surrounding the project caused its price to spike and break its bearish trajectory. Pepe reached highs of $0.000001141 on 10 November and then underwent another almost month-long consolidation.Yet, in recent days, the price has broken its consolidation resistance trend line, catapulting it 40% this week and making it one of the top-performing meme coins.$PEPE is currently up 8.5% on the last day, priced at $0.000001534, and could continue to recover during the Bitcoin bull run.Taking a long-term outlook, Pepe holds tremendous upside potential. It has a $640 million market cap, providing room for almost 3x growth to its ATH. Meanwhile, it presents room for nearly 8x to catch Shiba Inu by market cap and almost 20x to Dogecoin,opening the door to monumental gains for Pepe.Alongside its price increase, Pepe\u2019s trading volume has also surged recently. Currently, it is at $490 million. This is higher than Shiba Inu\u2019s, which is currently at $466 million and not far behind Dogecoin\u2019s $1.2 billion, despite a significantly lower market cap. TG Casino is a pioneering new crypto casino offering anonymous and secure gambling directly from the Telegram application, as seen on sites like Techopedia and Rakeback.com.Launching on Telegram provides various usability advantages, like a simplified betting process, end-to-end encryption, and access to Telegram\u2019s one billion users.Meanwhile, the project is KYC-free, and users only need to connect their wallets to start. This makes the Casino seamless, providing a massive advantage over market leader Rollbit, which is criticised for its complex signup process.The $TGC token also provides numerous advantages to holders, like free rewards, access to exclusive games and rooms, 25% cashback on losses, up to 200% rakeback, and a 173% staking APY.This creates a notable demand source that will push up the $TGC price. Meanwhile, it also features a cutting-edge buyback mechanism, repurchasing $TGC tokens from the open market with a portion of the casino\u2019s revenue.It will burn 40% of tokens and allocate 60% to staking rewards, making $TGC deflationary while rewarding holders in line with the casino\u2019s success.These factors amount to significant price potential, as highlighted by esteemed influencer Eric Cryptoman, who said it could be a \u201ctop runner\u201d once it launches on exchanges.Investors can buy TG Casino at presale for $0.175 but must hurry as its price will rise shortly.Another presale crypto offering a revolutionary use case is Bitcoin Minetrix . The project has raised $4.9 million in two months, indicating tremendous community interest.Bitcoin Minetrix enables users to mine Bitcoin by staking $BTCMTX on its Ethereum-based platform. Users stake their $BTCMTX tokens for mining credits, which they can burn for cloud mining power.This process enables anyone to mine Bitcoin, a tremendously powerful use case - especially considering the upcoming Bitcoin halving and anticipated price hike it will incur.Since it is based on cloud mining, users do not require hardware or specialist knowledge, and there are no overhead costs. Moreover, its decentralised and transparent $BTCMTX token eradicates the risk of cloud mining scams.Another advantage is there are no space or noise constraints for the user.All these factors provide immense value to Bitcoin mining, potentially moving the industry toward mass adoption, and $BTCMTX could therefore benefit from the next Bitcoin bull run.Moreover, the $BTCMTX token is central to the operation, with users requiring it for staking. This equates to a significant demand stream. Meanwhile, supply will be scarce since tokens will be locked for staking, and rewards will be paid out in mining credits, not $BTCMTX.IOTA is a well-established cryptocurrency that was deemed an Ethereum\u2013competitor in the 2017 bull run. However, it seemingly lost steam in the last bull market as its price failed to create a new ATH.Nevertheless, IOTA has gathered significant momentum recently, up 75% this week, with a $900 million market cap and price of $0.304.That said, it retains tremendous room for growth, currently 94% from its December 2017 ATH of $5.69.This could be a good crypto to buy ahead of the next bull run because its recent pump indicates a growing interest and potential trend reversal. Meanwhile, its upside potential is vast and boasts robust fundamentals.IOTA aims to build an \u201cInternet of Things\u201d leveraging a unique network architecture called \u201cThe Tangle,\u201d which makes the network more scalable as more people use it.It will integrate real-world items into the blockchain, providing a fast and secure distributed network where data can flow seamlessly and securely.There are infinite potential use cases for the project. Some of the most talked about are supply chain management, digital identities, and a \u201cdigital twin,\u201d which tracks the lifecycle of a real-life object such as a car, helping reduce the risk of fraud in the used car market.While many other top cryptos have experienced massive bullish momentum in recent weeks, XRP has remained relatively stable, up roughly 30% since October.It is currently priced at $0.617, with a $33 billion market cap.Yet, the exciting thing about the current XRP price is that it is just 20% higher than before its landmark partial victory over the SEC in its lawsuit.The currency was ruled not a security by the court, providing an unprecedented degree of legal clarity not present in any other crypto. Immediately, XRP\u2019s price spiked to upwards of $0.8 but pulled back after the SEC appealed the court\u2019s decision.Nevertheless, the court denied the SEC\u2019s appeal, but the price did not react as expected. Instead, it has consolidated between $0.58 and $0.62 while the rest of the market has soared.Given XRP\u2019s growing regulatory certainty, compelling use case as a global bridge currency for digital payments, and its market-leading partnerships, its price could be gearing for a tremendous pump in the coming weeks.This is furthered by its recent inactivity, increasing its upside potential relative to other cryptos that have already pumped."

        "title": "Karnataka Bitcoin scam: Police probe if hacker Sriki had access to electronic devices while in custody - The Indian Express",
        "content": "A special investigation team of the Karnataka police probing a Bitcoin scam involving alleged corruption by police officers and politicians is looking at whether international hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, arrested in 2020, had access to electronic devices while in prison.\n\nThe SIT is looking at whether Sriki (31) transferred cryptocurrency that was in his possession to bribe police officials and others while in police custody for nearly 82 days and subsequently while in judicial custody, as he has claimed. He was arrested by the Bengaluru crime branch police.\n\nThe Bitcoin scam involving Sriki and his associates has been at the centre of a political controversy in Karnataka with the Congress alleging that top leaders of the BJP, which was in power at the time of the hacker\u2019s arrest, and police officials had received kickbacks in cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SIT, created under the Criminal Investigation Department after the Congress government came to power, is looking for devices said to have been accessed by the hacker following his arrest and detention in police and judicial custody, sources said.\n\nThe SIT has also sought cancellation of bail granted earlier to the hacker and his associates in order to facilitate investigations including verification of the hacker\u2019s claims of having transferred cryptocurrency to police officials. The court is yet to arrive at a decision on the SIT plea.\n\n\u201cHe was in police custody for nearly 82 days after arrest. There were allegations that he was in possession of stolen cryptocurrency, but nothing was recovered in the police cases. These aspects are being investigated,\u201d a police source said.\n\nAs part of efforts to understand the hacker\u2019s association with cryptocurrency, the SIT has interviewed some of his past associates, including those who were at the centre of a criminal case filed against him in 2018. The case involving the son of a politician was believed to have emerged out of a dispute linked to cryptocurrency but was portrayed as arising from other reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn statements given to the police in the past, the hacker has claimed that he gave away Bitcoins that were in his possession to the police following his arrest in 2020. \u201cI understood the case scenario that even if I do not give them the Bitcoins they can use forensic methods to find the Bitcoins after a talk with the investigating officer. So post consultations I voluntarily accepted [sic] to give away the Bitcoins which I had kept in various wallets in different cryptocurrencies,\u201d reads a statement attributed to Sriki which is part of the chargesheet in one of the cases filed against him in 2021.\n\n\u201cEarlier when the BJP was in power, a Bitcoin scam running into lakhs of rupees is reported to have occurred through virtual transfers with several people involved in the transactions and the issue was hushed up without proper investigations,\u201d Home Minister G Parameshwara said while announcing new investigations in the hacker\u2019s cases in June.\n\nThe Congress has suggested in the past that there could be links between the release of Sriki from prison in April 2021 and the movement of Bitcoins stolen from the Bitfinex exchange in August 2016, in which the hacker has claimed involvement.\n\nBlockchain analysts reported on social media on April 14, 2021, that nearly 12,000 Bitcoins out of the 1,19,754 stolen during the Bitfinex heist had moved for the first time in over four years. Sriki was in the Bengaluru central prison when the stolen Bitcoins were moved. He was released on bail a few days later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe claim made on Whale Alert (a social media account tracking bitcoin movements) that 14,682 stolen Bitfinex bitcoins were transferred is completely unsubstantiated. There is nothing to suggest that it originated from Bangalore,\u201d the Bengaluru police said in a statement on November 12, 2021."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Fees Rise By Over 50%: Will BTC Conquer $69k? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "There is a spike in crypto on-chain activity if transaction fees lead. According to IntoTheBlock data on December 8, Bitcoin transaction fees are up by over 60%, while \u201cgas\u201d in Ethereum has climbed by nearly 50% in the past week.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Transaction Fees Rise By Double-Digits\n\nThis surge in activity can be pinned to multiple factors, mainly growing user interest and the ongoing crypto bull market. To illustrate, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are trending at 2023 highs above $43,500 and $2,300 when writing.\n\nEven so, the crypto community expects these coins to extend gains in the coming weeks and months, partly because of expected institutional capital, projected to be in their billions, flowing to the sphere.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, cumulative fees collected in Bitcoin this week stand at $43.8 million, up 61%. On the other hand, $83.3 million in fees has been accrued from Ethereum.\n\nLooking at the historical transaction fees trend, transacting on Ethereum, despite its relatively high transaction processing speeds (TPS), is more expensive than Bitcoin. This can be due to Ethereum\u2019s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT) minting, and more. Bitcoin is a transactional layer and doesn\u2019t inherently support smart contracts.\n\nUsually, rising on-chain transaction fees are bullish for price and indicate that their respective ecosystem is thriving from increasing adoption. With transaction fees rising in the two leading blockchain ecosystems, more people want to interact with the project. Subsequently, this could support prices since BTC or ETH is used for paying transaction fees.\n\nWill BTC Ease Past 2021 Highs Of $70,000?\n\nAs BTC is currently trading above $43,500 and ETH recently broke above $2,300, the possibility of these coins retesting and easing past their all-time highs of $70,000 and $4,800, respectively, cannot be discounted. One of the key drivers of the surge in on-chain activity is the ongoing bull market.\n\nWith crypto rising, more people are looking to position themselves, hoping to profit from further price appreciation. This wave of fear of missing out (FOMO) has pushed higher fees and prices.\n\nThe demand for liquid and SEC-recognized digital assets will likely increase once the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) goes ahead and authorizes the first Bitcoin ETF. This derivative product will allow institutions to invest in Bitcoin confidently through a regulated solution.\n\nAs the odds of the SEC approving this product rose from early Q4 2023, BTC and ETH prices started rising in sync. Still, how prices will react once the spot Bitcoin ETF is approved remains to be seen. Once the SEC green-lights a spot Bitcoin ETF, the crypto market will begin looking at Ethereum and whether the agency will approve a similar solution.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Drops Below $41,000 as Part of a Wider Crypto Selloff - BNN Bloomberg",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin posted its steepest drop in almost four months as traders moved to lock in profits following a more than 150% rally this year, triggering large liquidations of bullish bets.\n\nThe largest token sank as much as 7.7% on Monday, the biggest intraday decline since Aug. 18. It pared some losses to trade 7.5% lower at $40,524 at 2:32 p.m. in New York. Most major cryptocurrencies fell, with an index of the largest 100 digital assets sliding the most since November.\n\n\u201cMarket leverage had risen materially,\u201d said Sydney-based Richard Galvin, co-founder of Digital Asset Capital Management. \u201cThe current fall looks like a market deleveraging as opposed to any fundamental news catalyst.\u201d\n\nCoinglass data show that about $500 million worth of crypto trading positions betting on higher prices were liquidated on Dec. 11 \u2014 the highest tally since at least mid-September.\n\n\u201cThis move downward was broadly signaled by large growth in open interest and positive funding rates in perpetual swaps indicating a growth of bullish leverage in the market,\u201d said Darius Tabatabai, co-founder at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol.\n\nBitcoin has been on a tear this year on expectations that regulators will give the green light for the first US exchange-traded funds investing directly in the token, widening the potential base of crypto investors. Bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2024 have also helped fuel the rally.\n\nAwaiting the Fed\n\nInvestors are braced this week for US inflation data and the Fed\u2019s final policy meeting of 2023, both of which could test aggressive wagers on rate cuts. Global stocks were mixed on Monday as a dollar gauge ticked up, a sign of cautious sentiment.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to see some profit taking,\u201d said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty. He expects falls toward the $37,500 to $40,000 range to be \u201cwell-supported\u201d by dip buyers.\n\nBitcoin has jumped more than 150% year-to-date, energizing a wider recovery in digital-asset prices from a $1.5 trillion rout in 2022. The token remains well below its pandemic-era record of nearly $69,000 set just over two years ago.\n\nA \u201cless hawkish\u201d message from the Fed would likely cause a \u201cre-testing\u201d of Bitcoin\u2019s recent high near $45,000, according to Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets.\n\n--With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla and David Pan.\n\n(Updates prices.)\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."
