        "title": "The environmental impact of bitcoin mining explained - TechTarget",
        "content": "For those who chase innovation or who are looking for a new way to make money, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin may seem like an exciting but innocuous new tech. For those assessing the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, however, the technologies are far from benign.\n\nIndeed, mining for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is antithetical to climate progress. This is due to the technologies' massive energy needs and resulting pollution. Understanding these issues and why activists and legislators are pushing for change is important for anyone concerned with ensuring a livable planet.\n\nThe number of bitcoin owners is just 3.4% of the worldwide population, or 267 million people as of June 2023, according to Crypto.com, a cryptocurrency exchange company based in Singapore.\n\nYet the currency has an outsized impact on the environment.\n\nHow does bitcoin mining and cryptomining work? To understand the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining, particularly bitcoin mining, requires first understanding what cryptocurrency is and how the mining process works. A cryptocurrency -- such as bitcoin -- is a type of decentralized digital currency that can support international transactions, micropayments and peer-to-peer transactions. Some businesses and individuals accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment for goods and services, among other benefits and challenges. The underlying technology relies on blockchain, which is a digital record-keeping system simultaneously available in multiple locations, called nodes, within the network. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, don't rely on a central authority to oversee or regulate transactions. Instead, they use complex encryption techniques called cryptomining to secure and verify transactions and control the creation of new units. The environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining -- and Bitcoin mining, in particular -- is largely due to the main cryptomining approach in use called proof of work (PoW). The process requires a massive amount of computing power, as miners use complex algorithms and energy-intensive hardware and software to confirm transactions. To solve bitcoin's PoW system, miners compete to solve an encrypted puzzle within each block. The miners use specialized software to solve for the mathematical puzzle via trial and error, guessing until they get it right. Bitcoin miners are awarded a certain number of bitcoin for solving these puzzles, essentially being paid to do the validation work that enables the whole system. The PoW structure rewards miners who have the most powerful computers, since they can make more attempts in a shorter amount of time, making them more likely to solve the puzzle and earn bitcoin as a reward. A less-frequently used cryptomining approach is also in use. Proof of stake (PoS) requires significantly less energy and computing power than the PoW approach, largely in its limitation of participants. PoS means that the miner must provide a minimum deposit, or stake, to confirm the transaction.\n\nHow does bitcoin mining and cryptomining affect the environment? The cryptomining process has drawn criticism from sustainability advocates as well as some government officials and business leaders who fault the technology for its intense energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions and significant hardware needs. Cryptocurrencies also generate emissions and have other environmental impacts along their production supply chain and during disposal, generating e-waste at their end of life. \"Proof of work is a huge competition across computers, and that race to find a solution takes a lot of power,\" said Marc Lijour, a member of the IEEE and CEO at Creative Emergy. \"It's very inefficient.\" The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) compares bitcoin's energy needs to other activities, showing bitcoin requires nearly as much energy as powering all the lights and TVs in the U.S. Bitcoin mining has a presence in 58 countries, with most miners operating in the U.S. At 37.84%, the U.S. has the most energy-intensive bitcoin mining activity in the world, according to data from the CBECI. But the tech's environmental impact goes far beyond U.S. borders. Bitcoin's global electricity consumption of 173.42 TWh from 2020 to 2021 exceeds that of some countries, according to a study published by the journal Earth's Future. For example, that amount of power exceeds the combined electricity consumption of Argentina and the Philippines. That intense energy translates to massive levels of greenhouse gases. Bitcoin mining processes produced 85.89 MTCO2E, or metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, from 2020 to 2021, according to the study. This figure is comparable to 9,665 gallons of gasoline consumed by passenger vehicles, or 96,210 pounds of coal burned in one year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator. The environmental impact of bitcoin mining has environmental activists, governments and business leaders voicing concerns and questioning how to rein in its effects. Although there are over 10,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation, bitcoin is the most well-known. Ninety-five percent of cryptocurrency owners and people curious about ownership have heard of bitcoin, according to a 2021 report from cryptocurrency exchange company Gemini.\n\nBitcoin is the worst environmental offender The White House points to the fact that Bitcoin requires more energy than all other cryptocurrencies combined, according to the September 2022 report, \"Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States,\" published by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Bitcoin accounted for 60% to 77% of total global crypto-asset electricity use as of 2022, according to the report. The second highest user, the Ethereum network, accounted for 20% to 39%. Bitcoin's energy consumption is reliant on primarily non-renewable sources. Researchers estimated that 62% of the electricity used for bitcoin mining globally in 2022 came from fossil fuels, with coal-generated power being the largest single source, according to data from the CBECI. The numbers for renewable energy resources remain low for bitcoin's energy demands. It's estimated that 26% of the electricity powering bitcoin mining came from renewables, while the remaining 12% came from nuclear energy, according to data from the CBECI. As a result, bitcoin's electricity requirements produce a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Bitcoin's estimated greenhouse gas emissions were about 68.02 MTCO2E in 2022, according to data from Climate Watch, a digital platform managed by the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. In comparison, Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be about 67.3 MTCO2E in 2022, according to Climate Watch. The greenhouse gas emissions of Belarus were estimated at 65.3 MTCO2E in 2022. Although bitcoin's energy requirements and its corresponding greenhouse gas emission numbers draw the most scrutiny, experts said bitcoin impacts the environment in other ways. \"There are issues of concern beyond energy consumption,\" said David Boswell, senior director of community architecture at the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization headquartered in San Francisco. To start, bitcoin mining produces significant amounts of heat from the participating nodes. The production and disposal of hardware specifically for bitcoin mining is also a critical issue. \"Bitcoin miners cycle through a growing amount of short-lived hardware that could exacerbate the growth in global electronic waste,\" said Alex de Vries, founder of Digiconomist, and Christian Stoll, research affiliate at the Center for Energy Markets of the Technical University of Munich, in their September 2021 article \"Bitcoin's growing e-waste problem\" published by academic journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling. \"E-waste represents a growing threat to our environment, from toxic chemicals and heavy metals leaching into soils, to air and water pollutions caused by improper recycling.\" Bitcoin's e-waste adds up to 30.7 metric kilotons annually, which is comparable to the amount of IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by the Netherlands, according to de Vries and Stoll. The amount of e-waste generated by bitcoin mining alone could surpass current global estimates. Bitcoin's annual amount of e-waste \"may grow beyond 64.4 metric kilotons\" while global e-waste is expected to grow by 70% from 2016 to 2050, according to de Vries and Stoll.\n\nIs sustainable cryptomining realistic? Some researchers have put the environmental impact of bitcoin mining on par with two other major industries with outsized negative climate impacts -- beef and crude oil. That's according to the September 2022 report, \"Economic estimation of Bitcoin mining's climate damages demonstrates closer resemblance to digital crude than digital gold,\" published by Scientific Reports. The report calculated that for each dollar in bitcoin value produced, the process resulted in 35 cents in global climate damages. Industry watchers are taking notice. Pressure is building to address the environmental concerns raised around bitcoin, blockchain and other Web3 technologies, said Joe Davey, partner at West Monroe, a digital services firm headquartered in Chicago. The concern is not coming only from environmentalists but from businesses, too, as many have set sustainability targets and net-zero goals and are questioning whether bitcoin's environmental track record can fit with their corporate objectives. \"The energy consumption issue comes up as a question,\" Davey said. Such concerns are prompting some changes in the Web3 space. According to some experts, the most notable change comes from the Ethereum blockchain network, which shifted from a PoW system to the more energy efficient PoS mechanism in September 2022. The shift -- known as the Merge -- cut energy requirements by more than 99%. Experts continue to debate whether bitcoin could transition toward more energy-efficient methods. \"For bitcoin to change, you'd need a consensus among a large group,\" Davey said. \"And you'd have forks in bitcoin and that's probably what it's going to take -- a fork [of miners] moving to proof of stake.\" For bitcoin users, such a move would present several challenges. \"There's so much sunk costs, with the equipment around the mining rigs, just because bitcoin is the oldest network out there,\" Boswell said. Still, experts said some efforts to make bitcoin more sustainable could happen, such as getting a higher percentage of its electricity from renewable sources and recycling its heat -- both of which are happening in some places."

        "title": "Genesis Block: Bitcoin Definition, Mysteries, and Secret Message - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Genesis Block?\n\nA Genesis Block is the first block in a cryptocurrency blockchain. A blockchain consists of a series of blocks that are used to store information related to transactions that occur on a blockchain network. Each block contains a unique header, and each such block is individually identified by its block header hash.\n\nThese blocks are chained together by their encrypted headers, with the Genesis Block being the foundation\u2014and they grow in number. A block's number is referred to as its height on the blockchain. So, the Genesis Block has a height of zero, the following block has a height of one, and so on. The chained information in each block is one of the things that makes a blockchain so secure.\n\nBitcoin's Genesis Block was the first instance of a proof-of-work blockchain system and is the template for all other blocks in its blockchain. In 2009, Bitcoin's anonymous developer, Satoshi Nakamoto, created the Genesis Block, which launched the cryptocurrency and blockchain boom.\n\nKey Takeaways A Genesis Block is the first block on a cryptocurrency blockchain.\n\nIn 2009, a developer named Satoshi Nakamoto created the Genesis Block on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe information from the Genesis Block is present in all blocks in a blockchain because of how information is encrypted and used in the following blocks.\n\nUnderstanding the Genesis Block\n\nBlocks are effectively digital containers where data pertaining to the transactions on a network are permanently recorded. A block records as many of the most recent Bitcoin transactions it can hold that have not yet entered any prior blocks. Thus, a block is like a ledger or a record book page. Each time a block is \"completed,\" it gives way to the next block in the blockchain. A closed block is thus a permanent store of records that, once confirmed, cannot be altered or removed.\n\nThe Genesis Block, also known as Block 0, is the very first block upon which additional blocks in a blockchain are added. It is effectively the ancestor that every other block can trace its lineage back to since every block references the one preceding it. This began the process of validating bitcoin transactions and introducing new bitcoins into existence.\n\nThe next block, Block 1, wasn't mined until five days after the Genesis Block. This is considered odd as the average timestamp gap between blocks is intended to be 10 minutes.\n\nThere are a few theories regarding the delay of five days between the first two blocks: Some have theorized that Nakamoto spent five days mining the original block to test out the Bitcoin system to make sure it was stable (then backdated the timestamp), while more cultish followers believe Satoshi intended to recreate the story of God's rest after creating the world in six days\u2014even though the recorded difference is only five days.\n\nBitcoin Basics\n\nBitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency developed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin (with a capital b) refers to the blockchain and network, and \"bitcoin\"\u2014with a small \"b\"\u2014refers to the virtual coinage that is used. There are no actual coins, hence the \"bit\"\u2014or binary digit, the most basic unit of data in computing\u2014before \"coin.\"\n\nIn the world of virtual currency, blocks are files where data about the Bitcoin network and its transactions are permanently recorded. Each time a block is completed\u2014that is, when a miner guesses the solution\u2014the block is closed, giving way to the next block in the blockchain. The only way to release new cryptocurrency into circulation is to mine it (receive it as a reward for doing work for the blockchain). So, to \"mine bitcoin\" is to \"mint currency.\"\n\nLike gold, Bitcoin cannot be created arbitrarily. Gold must be mined out of the ground, and bitcoin (BTC) must be mined via digital means.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin's founder stipulated that, like gold, the supply of bitcoin should be limited and finite. Only 21 million BTC can be mined in total. When miners have unlocked this many bitcoin, the supply will be tapped out unless someone changes Bitcoin's protocol to allow for a larger supply.\n\nMysteries of the Genesis Block\n\nBeginning with the fact that the name \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" itself is a pseudonym, the Genesis Block and the founding of Bitcoin remain riddled with mystery. Shortly after Bitcoin's launch, the person calling themselves \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" vanished from the face of the earth, leaving barely a trace.\n\nThe First 50 BTC Could Not be Spent\n\nThe Genesis Block's beginnings were shrouded in the debate about a fine point of its creation: Was the code that rendered the Genesis Block effectively untradeable an intention or a mistake on the part of Nakamoto?\n\nAlthough the Genesis Block points to a web address\u2014written into the Genesis Block's code\u2014that link displayed an error message when activated. The system could not find the first transaction of 50 BTC in its database, and the spending transaction was rejected. So, the Genesis Block's transaction is not considered a \"real transaction\" by the original Bitcoin client.\n\nBut why? Did Nakamoto mean for the first bitcoin to be non-tradeable? Or was it a mistake? This became the subject of much debate among Bitcoin fans and insiders. Because of the precision of this developer, however, most believe it was hardly an error. Nakamoto likely wrote the code for the Genesis Block exactly the way he wanted it. We will never know why, as the quirk was not discovered until after Nakamoto disappeared.\n\nCurrent versions of the Bitcoin system handle the block/transaction databases differently from the original system, so the Genesis Block's transaction is now just a weird special case in the code.\n\nBitcoin's Genesis Block Message\n\nAnother puzzling aspect of the Genesis Block is the message that Nakamoto instilled within the Block's raw data: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\"\n\nAlthough Nakamoto never commented on the meaning of this text, most believe that it serves as a mission statement for Bitcoin itself.\n\nThe text is a headline for an article in the Jan. 3, 2009 edition of The [London] Times about the British government's failure to stimulate the economy following the 2007\u201308 financial crisis. Nakamoto spoke out against the idea of financial institutions that were too big to fail and wanted Bitcoin to be different. Most people think that Nakamoto's reference to the article in the Genesis Block's code was a hint as to how Bitcoin is different from the big investment banks that needed government bailouts in 2008.\n\nThe True Legacy of the Genesis Block\n\nBitcoin cannot be bailed out because its process eliminates the intermediary; no third party or corporate entity exists between BTC and the consumer.\n\nThe Bitcoin network checks and double-checks itself continuously using encryption, validation, and automated general consensus. Another failsafe is that because all transactions cannot be altered, the actions of miners can always be traced back to their wallet addresses, which makes it impossible to hide any evidence of wrongdoing. However, unless the owner of the wallet address makes their identity known, there is no way to know who it is.\n\nIn November 2013, early protegees of Nakamoto formed the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute (SNI) to educate the public about the history and vision of Bitcoin's creation. Among other interesting details, the SNI houses one of the biggest remnants of Nakamoto's online existence: An extensive list of forum posts, broken into subject categories, that the Bitcoin creator penned while still working on the project.\n\nSome Bitcoin fans hold the Genesis Block in a kind of cult-like reverence, as they do its anonymous creator. Fans are drawn to Bitcoin's arcane construct and idiosyncratic vocabulary with the fervor of one obsessed with a sophisticated arcade game.\n\nBitcoin devotees have been donating small amounts of BTC to the Genesis Block as a tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto. This is seen as a kind of sacrifice because once a coin is moved into the Genesis Block, it can never be used again\u2014sort of like throwing a quarter into a bottomless fountain.\n\nIs Genesis Block 0 or 1? The first block on the Bitcoin blockchain is the Genesis Block, which has a block height of zero.\n\nWhy Is the Genesis Block Important? The Genesis Block is actually not that important unless you view it as a historical occasion. It is simply the first block that contains the first transaction, but it has been hyped as something special by fans.\n\nWhen Was the First Bitcoin Block? The first Bitcoin block is believed to have been mined on Jan. 3, 2009, as it contains a message with that date, and the blockchain recorded it as such.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Genesis Block is the first block on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it is also a term that can be used to refer to the first block on any blockchain. It is special to cryptocurrency fans because it signifies an attempt to transition away from the current financial system, which is full of third parties chipping away at people's finances and causing widespread problems through corrupt practices.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is formally engaging with asset managers ahead of a much anticipated decision on whether the regulator will approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, according to memos published this week.\n\nThe regulator said in a memo that it met with Grayscale on Thursday about the potential conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The SEC had previously blocked this move, but Grayscale challenged that decision in court and won.\n\nSEC officials also met with representatives from BlackRock and the Nasdaq on Wednesday, according to a separate memo. BlackRock filed for a bitcoin ETF in June, followed shortly by a handful of other asset management firms.\n\nWhile the SEC could still decide to block crypto ETFs, many industry experts expect that such funds will launch in the U.S. early next year. The regulator has delayed decisions on several bitcoin funds in recent months and may choose to approve or deny all applications at around the same time.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has been a vocal critic of crypto but has said in recent public appearances that he would listen to his staff's input on a potential bitcoin ETF.\n\nGrayscale also recently hired John Hoffman, a longtime Invesco ETF executive, as a managing director. Hoffman will serve as the head of distribution and strategic partnerships for Grayscale, a sign that the crypto asset manager is gearing up to launch the fund if approved.\n\nThe growing confidence in the market that a bitcoin ETF will eventually be approved appears to have boosted the price of bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was trading above $37,000 on Thursday after falling to about $26,000 late this summer.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

South of the border, Balchunas has been tracking fund giants BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest and the handful of other firms awaiting spot Bitcoin ETF approval \u2014 expected in January.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOptimism surrounding a Securities and Exchange Commission nod has helped drive Bitcoin 126% higher this year.\n\nETF performance\n\nCanadian spot ETFs were initially predicted to be a game-changer, but when the Purpose Bitcoin ETF launched in 2021, its performance was underwhelming.\n\nExpected to rise to over $1 billion in assets under management within a week, inflows to Purpose in early weeks went slower than anticipated.\n\nBy April 2022, the ETF had amassed a record $1.7 billion in assets, but that figure was quickly washed away by the Terra collapse in May.\n\nLike many crypto markets, ETFs wallowed through 2022 and only started to recover this January.\n\nIn June, JPMorgan said there was \u201clittle interest\u201d in Canadian ETFs, using it as an example to why the US ETF hype might be overblown.\n\nOthers reject that analysis \u2014 including Balchunas and Canadian regulators.\n\nThe Ontario Securities Commission wrote in a 2023 report that \u201cmuch of the decline in AUM is due to the declining value of cryptocurrencies, rather than significant fund outflows.\u201d\n\nBalchunas noted that crypto ETF flows accounted for 5% of all flows in Canada this year. The increase in assets under management in the market adds up to 23% organic growth, a number Balchunas said is undeniable.\n\n\u201cThe JPMorgan thing baffled me,\u201d Balchunas said.\n\nCanada\u2019s ETF-friendly past\n\nCanada has a history of pushing out ETFs well ahead of the US, as far back as the world\u2019s first ETF, called the TIPs 35 Fund, which launched in 1990.\n\nThe US followed up with the SPY ETF in 1993. Balchunas cites Canada\u2019s first cannabis ETF, launched in 2017, as another example where Canada beat the US to the ETF punch \u2014 it took the US nearly four years to approve a similar product.\n\nBalchunas cites \u201cconservative\u201d regulators in the US, compared to Canada\u2019s \u201cmore liberal\u201d regime.\n\nStill, Balchunas says, the tendency has been for US approval to follow.\n\n\u201cOnce the first ETF in the asset class breaks through, the rest will be approved,\u201d he said.\n\nRoad to SEC approval\n\nPerformance of Canada\u2019s ETFs isn\u2019t the whole story.\n\nThe road to spot ETF approval has not gone smoothly \u2014 the SEC has rejected every application to date, and on Tuesday delayed approval of Franklin Templeton\u2019s proposed ETF.\n\nThe SEC has raised concerns that spot ETFs may be vulnerable to market manipulation and fraud. It has asked the public to express its concerns with such issues.\n\nCanada, on the other hand, approved the crypto ETFs in short order, and has arguably stricter regulatory controls \u2014 the country rolled out a series of rules in 2022, which saw several major crypto firms exit the country, including leading global exchange Binance.\n\n\u201cThe most important difference between Canada and the US right now is regulatory certainty in Canada,\u201d Laure Fouin, partner at Canadian law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, wrote in an email to DL News.\n\nFouin pointed to explicit crypto-related guidance issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators, which included agency expectations for crypto asset funds.\n\nCrypto firms in the US have long advocated for the SEC to produce explicit guidance for crypto assets.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has insisted that existing securities regulations are sufficient.\n\nThe SEC has so far only approved Bitcoin-related funds tied to futures contracts.\n\nTyler Pearson is a Researcher at DL News.

        "content": "Bitcoin is again inching closer to a potential price breakout, even as it hovers at its highest point in 18 months.\n\nMarkets priced bitcoin (BTC) above $38,600 on Friday morning \u2014 up 9% over the past month and more than double since this time last year.\n\nNumber-two crypto ether (ETH) is meanwhile playing catch-up. It\u2019s also at its highest point since mid-last year, but trails bitcoin\u2019s returns by nearly half.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio (the bitcoin cost of ether) has fallen by one-fifth over the past six months. It\u2019s showing signs of closing the gap, however, having regained almost 4.5% in November.\n\nBitcoin bulls may explain the crypto\u2019s strength with hype around spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 like the one BlackRock wants to launch \u2014 which could be approved any day now.\n\nThose ETFs will be forced to buy BTC to meet investor demand, representing perhaps billions in upward pressure. They might even reason that the DOJ\u2019s indictment of Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao gives a certain clarity to the crypto market that can only be good for prices.\n\nCrypto investors could even feel a little floaty due to arrests of hombres like FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, Terra ringleader Do Kwon and Celsius rabble-rouser Alex Mashinsky.\n\nSo, the tide went out, took the bad actors with it and now billions in fresh ETF money might wash ashore, bringing the bull market back along with it, some might say.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio has even underperformed BNB over the past year\n\nBears would say it\u2019s unclear whether ETFs would actually move the needle, considering the relatively small interest in the three spot funds already available to North American investors via Canadian markets.\n\nA fresh wave of spot ETFs could even be bad for bitcoin\u2019s price, especially if Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) loses ground to Wall Street operators like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou reckons up to $2.7 billion might flow out of GBTC and potentially be dumped on the market.\n\nStill, by some definitions, the bear market is squarely over. That doesn\u2019t explicitly mean the start of a new bull market.\n\nAlthough momentum does count for something, and if Bitcoin went up in November, could it do the same in December?\n\nIt turns out Bitcoin\u2019s price direction in December has matched November 10 times in its 13 years of existence, with only 2011, 2013, and 2014 not aligning \u2014 a 77% strike rate, per TradingView data.\n\nThat\u2019s more common than with months overall: 94 of the 170 months on record, or 56%, have aligned with the previous month\u2019s candle.\n\nAll this is probably statistically insignificant, on par with roulette math, given the small sample size.\n\nBut considering the crypto winter we\u2019ve had, markets will take what they can get.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining is defined as a process that secures and validates transactions on the Bitcoin network while introducing new bitcoins into circulation.\n\nThis process involves solving complex mathematical puzzles through computational power, and it plays a critical role in maintaining the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin system.\n\nIn this article, we explore the intricacies of Bitcoin mining, examining its operations, associated expenses, challenges, and recommended best practices.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is a process that secures and validates transactions on the Bitcoin network while introducing new bitcoins into circulation. This process involves solving complex mathematical puzzles through computational power, and it plays a critical role in maintaining the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin system.\n\nAt its core, Bitcoin mining involves adding new blocks to the blockchain \u2014 a public and immutable ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. Each block contains a group of transactions, and miners compete to create new blocks and append them to the existing chain. This is achieved through a consensus mechanism called proof of work (PoW).\n\nIn PoW, miners must find a special number called a \u201cnonce.\u201d They combine this nonce with transaction information and the previous block\u2019s code to create a new code (hash) that must start with a specific number of zeros. The challenge lies in finding the right nonce that meets this requirement.\n\nTo keep the system running smoothly, the difficulty of finding this nonce is adjusted regularly. This adjustment ensures that, on average, a new block is mined every 10 minutes, no matter how much computing power is added to the network. It helps maintain a steady and predictable pace for creating new blocks in the blockchain.\n\nMining begins when a miner selects a set of unconfirmed transactions from the Bitcoin mempool (or memory pool) \u2014 a pool of pending transactions. The miner assembles these transactions into a block and starts working on finding the correct nonce. Since the process is computationally intensive, miners use specialized hardware, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), to perform trillions of calculations per second.\n\nThe first miner to find the correct nonce broadcasts the new block to the network, along with the solution to the PoW puzzle. Other miners then verify the block\u2019s validity before accepting it into their copy of the blockchain. This verification ensures that the transactions within the block are legitimate and that the PoW solution is correct.\n\nOnce a block is accepted, it is linked to the previous block through its hash, forming an unbroken chain of blocks \u2014 the blockchain. The winning miner is rewarded with a fixed number of newly minted bitcoins, known as the \u201cblock reward,\u201d and any transaction fees users pay to include their transactions in the block.\n\nHowever, as more miners join the network and computational power increases, the difficulty of finding the correct nonce rises. This is to maintain the 10-minute block time and ensure a controlled issuance of new bitcoins. The block reward is also halved approximately every four years through \u201chalving.\u201d This halving is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol and aims to limit the total Bitcoin supply to 21 million, making it a deflationary digital currency.\n\nMining also serves as a fundamental security mechanism for the Bitcoin network. The decentralized nature of mining prevents any single entity from controlling most of the network\u2019s computational power. If a malicious actor were to gain control of over 50% of the network\u2019s mining power, they could potentially manipulate transactions, double-spend coins, and undermine the system\u2019s integrity. This is known as a \u201c51% attack\u201d and is a significant concern for any blockchain relying on PoW.\n\nSee More: Blockchain Engineer: Job Description, Key Skills, and Salary in 2022\n\nPrerequisites of Mining Bitcoin\n\nMining plays a pivotal role in the entire lifecycle of cryptocurrencies, encompassing transaction creation, transmission, and verification. This vital process ensures the digital currency\u2019s smooth and secure movement from one party to another. However, the mining operation requires several key prerequisites. Let\u2019s understand them in detail.\n\n1. Hardware requirements\n\nMining device : To mine efficiently, you need specialized hardware, preferably ASICs or graphics processing units (GPUs). ASICs are specifically designed for mining Bitcoin, while GPUs can also be used for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nProcessing power : The more processing power your mining hardware has, the higher your chances of successfully mining a block and earning rewards. Mining hardware is measured in hash rate, indicating the number of hashes it can calculate per second.\n\n2. Bitcoin wallet\n\nA Bitcoin wallet is essential to store the bitcoins you mine. Technically, a Bitcoin wallet contains private keys that allow you to access and control your Bitcoin holdings. You need a secure and reliable wallet to protect your earnings.\n\n3. Bitcoin mining software\n\nMining software connects your mining hardware to the Bitcoin network and enables you to participate in the mining process. The software receives and validates transactions, performs the PoW calculations, and communicates with the Bitcoin network. CGMiner, BFGMiner, and Easyminer are well-known mining software choices widely used in the mining community.\n\n4. Internet connectivity\n\nA stable and reliable internet connection is required to communicate with the Bitcoin network and other miners. Mining hardware must transmit blocks and receive new transactions and information from other nodes in real-time.\n\n5. Electricity and power costs\n\nMining is power-intensive, and electricity costs can significantly impact the profitability of mining operations. As mining hardware runs 24/7, you must consider the electricity consumption and the cost of electricity in your area.\n\n6. Cooling system\n\nMining hardware generates substantial heat; without proper cooling, it can overheat and fail. A cooling system, such as fans or liquid cooling, is necessary to keep the hardware at optimal operating temperatures.\n\n7. Knowledge and technical skills\n\nMining Bitcoin requires a certain level of technical expertise. You should understand computer hardware, software, networking, and troubleshooting well. You must be able to configure and optimize your mining hardware and software for maximum efficiency and stability.\n\n8. Joining a mining pool (optional)\n\nWhile it is possible to mine Bitcoin solo, the difficulty of mining has become so high that individual miners may take a long time to find a block. Joining a mining pool allows you to combine your hashing power with other miners, increasing the chances of earning regular rewards.\n\nMining pool members share the block rewards based on their contributed computing power.\n\n9. Secure environment\n\nMining hardware represents a significant investment, so it\u2019s crucial to ensure a secure physical environment to protect it from theft and damage.\n\n10. Compliance and legal considerations\n\nDepending on your location, there might be legal and regulatory requirements related to cryptocurrency mining. Ensure you comply with local laws and tax regulations concerning cryptocurrency activities.\n\nRemember that the mining landscape evolves rapidly, and profitability can change due to factors like Bitcoin\u2019s price, network difficulty, and the emergence of new, more efficient mining hardware. Therefore, staying informed and continually adapting your mining setup is crucial to remain competitive.\n\nSee More: What Is Computer Architecture? Components, Types, and Examples\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Mining Work?\n\nThe cryptocurrency mining market is experiencing substantial growth, driven by advanced distributed ledger technologies and increased electronic venture capital investments. As per a January 2023 report by Precedence Research, the global cryptocurrency mining market size reached $1.92 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach approximately $7 billion by 2032.\n\nAs we operate in this era of cryptocurrencies, it becomes crucial for industries to grasp the fundamental principles and mechanisms that facilitate Bitcoin mining. This can empower industries to make informed decisions and leverage the opportunities this evolving landscape presents.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of how Bitcoin mining works:\n\nTransaction collection : Users initiate Bitcoin transactions by sending and receiving bitcoins. These transactions are broadcast to the Bitcoin network and collected in a pool called the \u201cmempool,\u201d where they wait to be confirmed by miners. Block creation : Miners select a set of unconfirmed transactions from the mempool to include in a new block. Transactions are chosen based on transaction fees, with higher fees often prioritized to incentivize miners to include them in their blocks. Block header preparation : The selected transactions, along with the hash of the previous block, are combined to form the block header. The block header contains critical information that miners will modify to find a valid hash. Nonce finding : Miners attempt to find a specific numerical value known as a \u201cnonce\u201d by changing it in the block header. The nonce is an arbitrary number that miners can alter to generate different block header hashes. Proof of Work (PoW) : To create a valid block, miners must find a nonce that, when combined with the block header data, produces a hash that starts with a certain number of leading zeros (a hash with a specific difficulty level). This is the PoW puzzle that miners must solve. Hashing : Miners use the SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) cryptographic hash function to compute the hash of the block header with the modified nonce. Since the hash function is deterministic, the same data and nonce will always produce the same hash. Difficulty adjustment : The difficulty of the PoW puzzle is adjusted every 2,016 blocks (approximately every two weeks) to ensure that new blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes. If miners collectively find blocks too quickly or too slowly, the difficulty is adjusted up or down respectively. Finding the solution : Miners repeatedly change the nonce and hash the block header until they find a valid hash that meets the current difficulty requirement. This process requires substantial computational power to be completed successfully. Block broadcasting : Once a miner finds a valid hash, they broadcast the new block to the rest of the network. Other nodes and miners verify the validity of the block before accepting it. Block confirmation : As other nodes verify the validity of the new block, they add it to their copy of the blockchain. This process confirms the included transactions and ensures consensus across the network. Block reward : The miner who successfully mined the new block is rewarded with a fixed number of newly minted bitcoins, called the block reward. Currently, this reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block, but it halves approximately every four years through a process called halving. Transaction fees : In addition to the block reward, miners also collect transaction fees paid by users for including their transactions in the block. These fees serve as an incentive for miners to include transactions with higher fees in their blocks. Rinse and repeat : The mining process continues indefinitely as long as there are new transactions to process, and miners compete to find the next valid block and claim the block reward.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin mining involves selecting transactions, creating a block, finding a nonce that results in a valid hash, and then broadcasting the new block to the network. The process requires significant computational power and serves as the foundation for securing the Bitcoin network and validating transactions.\n\nSee More: What Is Clickjacking? Definition, Methods, and Prevention Best Practices for 2022\n\nCosts and Challenges of Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining operates as a business venture where profitability hinges on investing in various inputs. Three primary costs are associated with Bitcoin mining:\n\n1. Electricity\n\nRunning mining systems 24/7 incurs substantial electricity expenses, considering the energy consumption of the mining process, akin to that of certain countries. Additionally, cooling the mining rigs is essential due to the significant heat generated, leading to additional costs for air conditioning.\n\nIn May 2023, Statista reported that the annual global electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining reached around 95.58 terawatt-hours for that month alone.\n\n2. Mining systems\n\nWhile regular computers and gaming systems can be used for mining in a pool, the returns are limited due to shared rewards based on individual contributions. To be competitive, dedicated ASIC mining machines are necessary, each costing between $4,000 to $12,000. The mining speed and the number of rigs purchased determine the overall expenditure.\n\n3. Network infrastructure\n\nWhile network speed has minimal impact, low latency is crucial for efficient communication with the Bitcoin network. Mining farms need several internal connections, linking mining rigs to a central router or server for internet access. However, additional bandwidth is usually unnecessary for smaller operations using gaming rigs in a pool, with low latency being sufficient.\n\nFor profitability, the total costs of these inputs must be lower than the output, represented by the bitcoin price. The fluctuating nature of bitcoin prices adds complexity to the equation, making the venture uncertain. Despite the allure of minting one\u2019s cryptocurrency, the economic challenges of Bitcoin mining might lead to lower profits and a longer breakeven time for those entering this lottery-like environment.\n\nChallenges of Bitcoin mining\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin cryptocurrency through mining is considered highly profitable. As per the Cambridge Digital Assets Program\u2019s (CDAP) May 2022 report, the United States is the largest Bitcoin mining industry worldwide, contributing to over 38% of the global Bitcoin network\u2019s hash rate.\n\nHowever, it has not been immune to challenges, and even today, Bitcoin mining companies encounter various issues. Here are some of the primary challenges that Bitcoin mining confronts:\n\nBitcoin Mining Challenges\n\n1. Shortage of skilled personnel\n\nLike most economic sectors, cryptocurrency also faces a scarcity of skilled personnel. As a relatively new technology, finding individuals proficient in machine operation and mining techniques is difficult. To address this, some Bitcoin mining firms invest in training new hires. However, this process is time-consuming and costly, resulting in slower mining operations and reduced revenue due to insufficient skilled personnel.\n\n2. Upfront initial costs\n\nThe initial costs involved in Bitcoin mining pose a significant challenge. In traditional manufacturing businesses, these costs are often referred to as production costs, but in Bitcoin mining, they are considered operational costs. Successful cryptocurrency mining now requires high-end supercomputers, unlike the early days when personal computers sufficed.\n\nWith increased participation in the mining venture, competition has intensified, driving the need for more powerful computers. However, without such robust equipment, mining agencies struggle to generate profits. Acquiring these powerful supercomputers requires a substantial capital investment, making it difficult for several organizations to fund their Bitcoin mining processes adequately and maintain network operations.\n\nThe higher initial costs have forced various mining companies out of business, leading to a scarcity of available Bitcoins. They have also prolonged the time needed to recover these initial investments and achieve significant growth. If the mining machines were more affordable, it would attract more participants, resulting in increased mining and more coins generated.\n\n3. Volatility in Price\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector is known for its unpredictable price variations, which pose a major drawback. Even traders on certified crypto exchanges like Immediate Edge struggle to navigate these fluctuations. Available data indicates that Bitcoin prices reached their peak in November 2021, surpassing $60,000. However, since January 2022, the prices have significantly declined. As of the time this article was written, the Bitcoin price is hovering around $37,000.\n\nThe price volatility presents a considerable threat to Bitcoin mining investors as it can result in unprecedented losses. When Bitcoin prices rise, miners can earn substantial income, but profits decrease considerably during price declines. The fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices will continue to be a key challenge for investors until the industry stabilizes.\n\n4. Escalating operational expenses\n\nHigh operational costs present a significant challenge in any business, as they directly impact the return on investment (ROI). For Bitcoin mining, operational expenses, especially electricity bills, account for a substantial portion of the revenue, ranging between 30 to 40 percent. This allocation of resources limits the ability to invest in newer and improved mining equipment or to maintain existing ones. As a result, achieving significant profits becomes difficult, posing a hindrance to the growth and efficiency of mining operations.\n\n5. Government regulations\n\nGovernment regulations play a pivotal role in the Bitcoin landscape. While certain countries have embraced Bitcoin and its use within their borders, many others have yet to follow suit. Some nations view cryptocurrencies as risky and have even deemed them illegal, creating barriers for aspiring Bitcoin mining investors in those regions.\n\nNotably, China has banned Bitcoin mining due to its substantial electricity consumption. Similarly, in January 2022, Kosovo took measures to address its energy crisis resulting from surging global prices by imposing a ban on cryptocurrency mining that contributed to increased electricity consumption in the region.\n\nThe future of mining holds promise as the global adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow. Once more countries fully embrace this digital currency revolution, mining will likely become more seamless and profitable globally.\n\nSee More: Top 10 Antivirus Software in 2022\n\nTop 4 Bitcoin Mining Software\n\nPresently, numerous industries view Bitcoin as a promising future for commerce.

        "content": "While cryptocurrency isn\u2019t as commonplace as emerging payment methods like mobile wallets and other digital payment forms, its use has become more widespread in recent years \u2013 and small business owners are taking note.\n\nBitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency working its way into the mainstream. If you own a restaurant, you might think about accepting Bitcoin as a payment form to attract more customers to your restaurant and increase your restaurant\u2019s profits. However, you may also be wary of Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and how it integrates with restaurant accounting systems.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore Bitcoin and how it works and examine the benefits and challenges of accepting Bitcoin as a restaurant payment option.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Considering a POS system? We can help you choose the one that\u2019s right for you. Use the questionnaire below to have our sister site, BuyerZone, provide you with information from a variety of vendors for free:\n\nWhat is Bitcoin? Bitcoin was created in 2009, making it the first modern cryptocurrency. It is an all-digital currency that relies on peer-to-peer blockchain technology for tracking and trading. No centralized system, bank or government backs Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin was primarily designed as a payment form, most people currently use Bitcoin and its cryptocurrency cousins for investment purposes. Still, Bitcoin is by far the most common cryptocurrency businesses accept as payment. In 2021, Pew Research found that 16% of Americans (and 31% of Americans between 18 and 29) have invested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and over 15,000 companies around the world accept Bitcoin, according to Zippia. FYI Did you know If your personal Bitcoin holdings increase in value, the IRS considers that a taxable event, and you\u2019ll pay up to 37% on your profits. Consider hiring a CPA well-versed in crypto to stay compliant.\n\nHow does Bitcoin work? To accept Bitcoin in your restaurant, you\u2019ll need to sign up for a Bitcoin merchant wallet account via an online platform like Confirmo, BitPay, or CoinGate. Many of these crypto wallets integrate with the best POS systems, as well as shopping cart and commerce platforms. Some of the best credit card processors accept cryptocurrency payments, making it easier for merchants to support Bitcoin payments. A typical restaurant payment transaction with Bitcoin would go something like this: The restaurant shows the Bitcoin-paying customer a QR code. The customer scans the QR code; their personal crypto wallet reads the virtual address where it should send the payment. This address is usually a one-time destination code. The customer enters their private key, which is like a password, to verify the transaction. Depending on your restaurant\u2019s POS software or accounting software, you may be able to convert the Bitcoin payment into U.S. dollars for easy accounting and tax keeping. Did You Know? Did you know When a business accepts credit cards, transaction approval or denial is immediate. With Bitcoin, it can take up to an hour. Most Bitcoin merchants wait for the sixth blockchain confirmation before deeming a transaction successful.\n\nShould your restaurant accept bitcoin? There are several compelling reasons why your restaurant should accept cryptocurrency, but you\u2019ll need to seriously weigh the downsides before making a decision. Here are some upsides of accepting Bitcoin in your restaurant: Lower transaction fees. Merchant service providers charge up to 4% per transaction \u2013 or even more if your diner is from overseas. Crypto fees can be 1% or less \u2013 but watch out for transaction fees called gas fees, particularly with Ethereum.\n\nMerchant service providers charge up to 4% per transaction \u2013 or even more if your diner is from overseas.

Many Bitcoin holders are enthusiastic about cryptocurrency and its perceived ability to improve the financial system. If you accept Bitcoin, these individuals may seek you out to support your restaurant. \u201cFor marketing-savvy businesses, it is definitely a differentiator to be able to accept Bitcoins, and if you are trying to attract an audience that uses Bitcoin, you may be perceived as a techno-savvy restaurant or establishment,\u201d according to technology futurist and podcast host Ian Khan.\n\nMany Bitcoin holders are enthusiastic about cryptocurrency and its perceived ability to improve the financial system.

No chargebacks. Accepting Bitcoin means you can avoid chargebacks. Unlike standard credit and debit cards, consumers can\u2019t contact Bitcoin to have a transaction reversed. The only way you\u2019ll ever reimburse a customer is if you choose to do so. Here are the downsides of accepting Bitcoin in your restaurant: Price volatility. Cryptocurrency exchange rate swings tend to be much more severe in both directions than traditional currency. Here\u2019s an example of Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and how it might affect your restaurant: Let\u2019s say your restaurant hosts a party of Cambodian citizens celebrating their country\u2019s independence day on November 9, 2021. They spend $1,000. If you took that money in U.S. dollars, it would lose some value through inflation. Bitcoin\u2019s value on that day was $66,938, but on June 18, 2022, it was worth $18,948.80 \u2013 a drop of 71.7%. If you accept Bitcoin, you\u2019re also accepting its volatility.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange rate swings tend to be much more severe in both directions than traditional currency.

Regulations will likely make handling crypto more difficult and expensive. Accounting may be more challenging. Most cloud-based accounting packages aren\u2019t set up to handle Bitcoin transactions. This will make bookkeeping more challenging, especially if you\u2019re regularly converting from dollar to Bitcoin and vice versa. Tip Bottom line If you decide to accept Bitcoin, share the news via social media posts and signage in your restaurant. Consider promoting your restaurant by registering with websites like Coinmap.org and SpendBitcoins to draw in crypto users."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is the world's most popular digital currency, and in contrast to flat currencies like the dollar, pound, yen, and euro, it isn't issued by any government. So, how is Bitcoin valued? This article will explore the price drivers behind the digital coin, such as supply and demand, regulation, cost of production, and news and competition, highlighting why these factors make Bitcoin a volatile asset for investors in Wisconsin and the United States.\n\nBitcoin price dynamics: supply and demand impact\n\nSupply and demand will be familiar to those with an economic background. However, if this term seems alien to you, this explanation will help you understand how this concept directly affects the price of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. For example, supply and demand work together to determine the quantity of a specific commodity and its market price. As this price increases, the demand for economic goods declines. This means sellers will create more of the commodity or vice-versa. This dynamic holds for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, just like it does for the spot price of commodities (such as oil) that use flat exchange rates, for example, USD to GBP.\n\nImpact of competitive markets and news on Bitcoin\n\nWith cryptocurrencies becoming ever-more popular worldwide, Bitcoin has seen an influx of competition to its throne as the go-to crypto, which affects its price. Altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) have given investors plenty of ways to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios. For example, any improvements to an altcoin like Ethereum may see Bitcoin's price plummet. Furthermore, media attention can fuel speculation and turn up price volatility. For instance, negative press surrounding cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, can lead to panic-selling by some Bitcoin owners, ultimately driving its price down. Alternatively, the inverse is also true, and positive news surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can move its price upwards.\n\nImpact of accessibility and liquidity on Bitcoin prices\n\nThe accessibility of Bitcoin will significantly influence its price now and in the future. For example, the more widely adopted Bitcoin becomes, the more valuable it will be. For instance, crypto-friendly governments and countries like Switzerland, the first country to offer crypto companies business accounts in 2018, will positively affect Bitcoin's price. Furthermore, liquidity is something to consider when analyzing the price drivers behind Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin is regarded as the most liquid cryptocurrency currently available to investors; why? Because it can be easily bought and sold on exchanges and converted for cash. While liquidity is often good for price stability, it's important to remember that changes in liquidity can cause Bitcoin prices to swing.\n\nBitcoin price drivers: risks and investing insights\n\nAnother factor that can affect Bitcoin's price is risks that may affect its supply and demand. For example, due to its digital nature, Bitcoin can be prone to events such as cyber-attacks. For instance, individuals' crypto wallets or the exchanges they hold Bitcoin on may get hacked, creating instability in Bitcoin's price. Moreover, regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin vary in different countries and states in the US. This means there is always a chance that laws may be passed that could nationally and internationally affect the ownership of Bitcoin and its liquidity. However, rules and regulations set by governments can lead to surges in Bitcoin prices; for instance, cryptocurrency groups are expanding in Hong Kong due to the rules and restrictions placed upon digital currencies in mainland China.\n\nFinal notes: unveiling Bitcoin's price drivers\n\nInvestors in Wisconsin and the United States must note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and influenced by government regulations, liquidity, competition between digital currencies, news surrounding cryptocurrencies, and supply and demand. In turn, this makes predicting the exact price movements of Bitcoin challenging; however, improvements in scalability, security, and privacy features may increase confidence in Bitcoin and make it a more appealing investment for a bigger audience in the future.\n\nInformation on this website is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice.

        "content": "Impacted Communities and Enviro Advocates React to New Report Showing Cryptomining\u2019s Massive Water Consumption\n\nWashington, DC (November 30, 2023) \u2013 On Thursday, environmental advocates from across the country held a press conference following a groundbreaking report outlining the astounding volume of water used to mine Bitcoin. Published by Alex de Vries in the peer-reviewed Cell Reports Sustainability journal, the report is the first comprehensive estimate of total water consumption in the global Bitcoinindustry.de Vries joined national environmental advocates and local community members from New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky to address the concerning impact of nearby Bitcoin mining operations on water supplies and community health. Bitcoin mining\u2019s significant water usage poses a pressing concern amid the global water crisis, with potential for even faster growth in water demand. The report warns that the sheer scale of Bitcoin mining\u2019s water usage could impact drinking water supplies if it continues to operate without constraints, especially in countries that are already battling water scarcity, including the United States.\n\nNot only are Bitcoin mining plants using massive amounts of water to operate, they also often discharge the water back into local water supplies or wastewater treatment facilities. This thermal pollution endangers health and wildlife habitability, including but not limited to potential harmful algal blooms, fish deaths, biodiversity loss and migration, oxygen depletion, direct thermal shock, and changes in dissolved oxygen.\n\nWatch the virtual press conference here.\n\nProof-of-work cryptocurrency mining is an energy-intensive process that requires a massive fleet of single-purpose machines to operate around the clock in a race to guess numbers. A large amount of water is used to cool the computers at large data centers. In addition to cooling computers, coal and gas-fired power plants that generate electricity to power the mining must also use water to manage the temperature.\n\nThe recent report found the following:\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin mining consumed over 1,600 gigaliters (GL) of water worldwide\n\nIn the United States, Bitcoin mining consumes about 93 GL to 120 GL of water every year, equivalent to the average water consumption of 300,000 U.S. households or a city like Washington, D.C.\n\nEach transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain uses 16,000 liters of water on average, about 6.2 million times more than a credit card swipe, or enough to fill a backyard swimming pool.\n\nThe water footprint of Bitcoin in 2021 significantly increased by 166% compared with 2020, from 591.2 to 1,573.7 GL, and it is only expected to increase to 2,300 GL in 2023.\n\nAlex deVries, the paper\u2019s author and a Ph.D. student at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam said, \u201cBitcoin is now responsible for consuming more water than the entire traditional financial system (bank notes + bank branches + ATMs + cashless transactions) combined. On average a backyard swimming pool worth of fresh water (over 16000 liters) goes up in smoke for every single transaction processed on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is about 6.2 million times more than the amount of water consumed for a regular credit card swipe. Many parts of the world are experiencing droughts, and fresh water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource. If we continue to use this valuable resource for making useless computations, I think that reality is really painful.\u201d\n\nErik Kojola, Greenpeace USA Senior Researcher said, \u201cThis groundbreaking report underscores the widespread environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining\u2019s alarming water consumption is a stark reminder that the unbridled growth of this industry poses a direct threat to global water resources and necessitates immediate action. Furthermore, the disheartening contradiction of financial institutions, including BlackRock, Chase, Fidelity, and others, investing in Bitcoin mining despite their professed ESG goals raises serious concerns. The finance industry needs to accelerate action to address the environmental damage from its investment decisions \u2013 and it can start by engaging with us to clean up Bitcoin by transitioning away from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work system.\u201d\n\nMandy DeRoche, Deputy Managing Attorney at Earthjustice said, \u201cFor decades, fossil fuel power plants have been significant sources of water pollution, and energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining only prolongs this pollution. Examples like the Fortistar gas plant in North Tonawanda, New York, the Stronghold waste coal plants in Pennsylvania, and the Merom coal plant in Indiana all demonstrate the urgent need for regulatory oversight to mitigate environmental harms caused by these operations and to protect nearby communities.\u201d\n\nAbi Buddington, member of Seneca Lake Guardian and Secretary of the Committee to Preserve the Finger Lakes said, \u201cThe Finger Lakes region, my home, faces peril from the escalating cryptomining industry, exemplified by the Greenidge Generation plant situated a mile from my property since 2020. With its massive water withdrawals from Seneca Lake and discharge into Keuka Lake Outlet, their extensive pollution, including harmful elements like arsenic and magnesium, imperils our precious ecosystem. As local New Yorkers devoted to safeguarding our natural heritage, we demand accountability for the environmental havoc caused by this industry. Seneca Lake\u2019s splendor, and its surrounding community, deserve greater protection and respect.\u201d\n\nJackie Sawicky of the Texas Coalition Against Cryptomining said,\u201cNavarro County in particular, and Texas in general have serious drought issues. In the era of climate change and worsening drought, we should be exceedingly discerning with every drop of water we use. We have real industries that produce real products here and the Riot Platforms bitcoin \u201cmine\u201d will use more water per day than all of them. For what? To guess and throw away numbers in a digital lottery that most Texans want nothing to do with.\u201d\n\nContact: Gujari Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], (631) 404-9977; Ana Hall, Pythia Public, [email protected], 914-874-9288\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "content": "In an age when technological advancements are redefining every profession, dentistry isn\u2019t untouched. Artificial intelligence (AI), digital radiography, teledentistry, and intraoral scanners are just a few examples. But beyond dentistry-specific technology, there\u2019s a financial revolution that every dentist\u2014in fact, every professional\u2014should be aware of: Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that operates without a central authority or single administrator. Instead, it allows users to send money directly to each other through its own peer-to-peer network. This network uses cryptography to verify transactions, which are then recorded on a public digital ledger known as a blockchain.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nFunctions of money\n\nTo understand Bitcoin, it\u2019s important to understand money. Money serves several key functions and has some specific properties:\n\nMedium of exchange: Money facilitates transactions by providing a universally accepted asset. Bitcoin, accepted globally, fills this role, cutting across traditional banking barriers.\n\nStore of value: Money retains value over time, allowing individuals to save for the future. With its limited supply, Bitcoin can potentially be an excellent store of value, similar to gold.\n\nUnit of account: Prices of goods and services are represented in terms of money, giving it a standard metric. Bitcoin\u2019s increasing adoption makes it a growing metric for digital transactions.\n\nProperties of money\n\nDurability: Money should withstand wear and tear. Physical currencies, such as paper bills, have a life span, while digital ones don\u2019t degrade.\n\nPortability: Money should be easily transported. Coins and notes have been handy, but digital currency takes portability to a new dimension. Imagine trying to transport large amounts of gold!\n\nDivisibility: Money should be easily divided. Just as a dollar can be broken down into cents, one Bitcoin can be split into 100 million smaller units called satoshis.\n\nFungibility: Every unit of money should be the same as every other unit. Every Bitcoin holds the same value as every other Bitcoin.\n\nLimited supply: To maintain its value, money should be somewhat scarce. Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, ensuring a fixed supply. Compare this to the current monetary supply which has no upper limit.\n\nAcceptability: People must accept money for it to have value. More and more merchants and individuals accept Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin: digital gold\n\nFor centuries, gold has been a trusted store of value. Its scarcity, luster, and nonreactivity have made it a preferred asset. But in the digital age, Bitcoin is frequently referred to as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n\nScarcity: Just as there\u2019s a finite amount of gold on Earth, there\u2019s a cap on Bitcoin\u201421 million coins.\n\nDecentralization: Gold isn\u2019t governed by a single entity or country, and similarly, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, free from governmental controls.\n\nStore of value: Historically, in times of economic uncertainty, people flock to gold to preserve wealth. Bitcoin, with its noncorrelation to traditional financial markets, offers a similar haven in the digital world.\n\nPortability: While gold is heavy and challenging to transport, Bitcoin can be sent anywhere globally with an internet connection, making cross-border transfers seamless.\n\nWhy should we care?\n\nGlobal payments: Bitcoin can make transactions quicker and often cheaper, eliminating traditional banking and conversion fees.\n\nInvestment: Diversification is the key to a balanced investment portfolio. Including digital assets like Bitcoin can potentially hedge against inflation or economic downturns.\n\nFuture preparedness: As more patients become familiar with and begin to use cryptocurrencies, offering payment options in Bitcoin can make your dental practice more inclusive and tech-forward.\n\nBitcoin, with its unique properties aligning closely with the fundamental aspects of money, is reshaping the financial landscape. While its comparison to gold offers a touchpoint to its potential as a store of value, its digital nature gives it unparalleled advantages in a connected world.\n\nFor dental professionals, understanding and embracing Bitcoin not only offers novel financial avenues, but can position a practice at the forefront of modern, patient-centric services.\n\nJust as we\u2019ve embraced technology in treatments and patient management, it may be time to do the same with money.\n\nEditor's note: This article appeared in the November 2023 print edition of Dental Economics magazine.

But some believe the SEC would allow a bunch of bitcoin ETFs to launch at once, meaning the regulator could wait for the comment periods for other competing proposals to conclude.\n\nThe SEC is collecting public feedback for the proposed spot bitcoin ETFs by Franklin Templeton and Hashdex until Jan. 5, filings show.\n\nThe regulator said in a Tuesday disclosure it had chosen to \u201cinstitute proceedings\u201d to determine whether to approve or deny the Franklin Bitcoin ETF. It filed a separate order seeking comments on the Hashdex product the same day.\n\nThese filings to move along the proposal process for these ETFs came earlier than expected.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s \u201cquicker turnaround than usual\u201d indicates it might be looking to line up a bunch of approvals at once, after that period ends on Jan. 5, Van Buren Capital general partner Scott Johnsson said in a Thursday X post.\n\nRead more: SEC should \u2018stop picking winners\u2019: VanEck exec\n\nBecause the regulator would not file spot bitcoin ETF approvals on the weekend, Johnsson noted, the timeframe between Jan. 8 and Jan. 10 would make sense.\n\n\u201c[Five] days not a lot of time to review comments,\u201d Johnsson added in a separate post. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance there won\u2019t be any unique comments to work through anyway.

        "content": "The open interest in bitcoin long futures held by asset managers on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), has reached an all-time high.\n\nOpen interest of CME bitcoin long futures by asset managers increased from $1.04 billion at the end of October, to a current value of $1.98 billion, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\nThe current value of the contracts held by asset managers eclipsed the former all-time high. When bitcoin's price reached an all-time high in November 2021 of $68,000, the CME bitcoin long futures open interest held by asset managers at the time went only as high as $1.67 billion.\n\nThe uptick in open futures contracts suggests asset managers are anticipating bitcoin price appreciation by the time the current contracts expire on the last Friday of December.\n\nThe open interest from hedge funds going long on bitcoin futures on the CME is also at a high point. Currently, there's $680 million of open interest from hedge funds going long, which remains below the all-time high of $960 million.\n\nThat said, hedge funds are also responsible for the majority of open interest for short positions for bitcoin futures on the CME. Such hedge funds are responsible for more than $2 billion of open interest in this direction.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nOverall, asset managers have a net long position that's $1.97 billion in size, while hedge funds have a net short position, worth $1.36 billion, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\nOn November 10, CME bitcoin futures flipped Binance\u2019s BTC -3.45% futures markets in terms of size, showing increased demand from institutional investors. According to data from Coinglass, the total open interest on the CME for bitcoin futures is now $4.15 billion, compared to $4.08 billion on the Binance futures market.\n\nData from The Block's Data Dashboard also shows an all-time high for large open interest holders of CME bitcoin futures, for both long and short positions. The uptick in open interest for positions involving at least 25 bitcoin shows increased activity in the derivatives market by participants with large holdings. This would suggest market activity is leaning towards trades by more sophisticated, experienced investors."

        "content": "SEC\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has initiated a public comment period on spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications from Wall Street investment-management firm Franklin Templeton and Brazil-based cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Hashdex, the agency announced in a filing on Nov. 28.\n\n\n\nThe SEC has 240 days to approve or deny an ETF filing and must provide an update on its decision at certain intervals. It wasn\u2019t due for another decision on Franklin Templeton's application until Jan. 1. Starting the public comment period earlier than that may indicate that the SEC is accelerating its timeline for an anticipated \u201cspotcoin\u201d ETF approval.\n\n\n\nBloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote on X, the social-media platform formerly called Twitter, that the SEC move to open a comment period on Hashdex \u201call but confirms for me that this was likely a move to line every applicant up for potential approval by the Jan. 10, 2024 deadline.\u201d\n\nFranklin Templeton, which has about $1.5 trillion in assets under management, first filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in October. Its filing was previously delayed on Nov. 15.\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 29, Franklin Templeton amended its prospectus, saying that it had responded to the SEC\u2019s questions and concerns about its application.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nWhile asset managers have attempted to roll out a spot bitcoin ETF for years, the SEC has denied or delayed those funds based on concerns about market manipulation and investor protection.\n\n\n\nYet, after the SEC lost a watershed lawsuit to Grayscale Investments in August, it began to work more closely with about a dozen firms to potentially bring the funds to market.\n\nMany hopeful firms, including ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood, believe the SEC will approve multiple applications all at once to avoid giving any single firm a first-mover advantage.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "It probably won't come as a shock to those aware of the electricity usage of the Bitcoin network, but the world's most popular cryptocurrency also uses tons of water to keep itself running.\n\nAccording to Digiconomist founder and Vrije University data science PhD candidate Alex de Vries, the Bitcoin network may be using as much as 2,237 gigaliters of water in 2023, which equates to around 590 billion US gallons, or 492 billion imperial gallons, De Vries concluded in a paper published yesterday.\n\nTo put that in perspective, let's look at just the US alone, where around a third of the world's Bitcoin mining takes place. In the course of a year, US Bitcoin mining operations chug somewhere between 39 and 120 gigaliters of water, De Vries estimates, which is equivalent to the water consumption of 300,000 US households, or a city the size of Washington DC.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of solving cryptographic problems to validate entries on the blockchain. It's an incredibly energy intensive process incentivized by paying miners in newly minted Bitcoin; the higher the price the more miners participate, and the more energy is burned to solve a transaction.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin crashed last year, leading to a comparable drop in electricity and water consumption, but a rebound this year led to an all-time high in energy consumption in March 2023, De Vries said in his paper. March's annualized energy usage amounted to around 141.9 terawatt-hours \u2013 a 35 percent increase compared to energy usage in 2021.\n\nWith the price of Bitcoin continuing to climb over the course of 2023, \"water consumption is probably at an all-time high right now too,\" De Vries told The Register \u2013 even higher than earlier this year.\n\nMuch of the reporting on Bitcoin's environmental impact has centered on its carbon footprint and electricity usage, which De Vries has maintained a record of on Digiconomist since founding the site in 2014. Water usage has been far less reported; Cell Reports, where De Vries' paper was published, says his research is the first comprehensive look at Bitcoin's water use.\n\nTalk about Bitcoin liquidity\n\n\"The most painful thing about cryptocurrency mining is that it uses so much computational power and so much resources, but these resources are not going into creating some kind of model, like artificial intelligence, that you can then use for something else. It's just making useless computations,\" De Vries said.\n\nAgain, to put things into perspective, De Vries cites estimates from 2021, when global Bitcoin mining operations used around 1,600 GL of water, which amounts to around 16,000 liters of water per Bitcoin transaction \u2013 6.2 million times more than the amount of water used for a single credit card swipe. Keep in mind the estimated water usage is even higher this year.\n\nWith such an environmental impact, is there anything that can be done to reduce Bitcoin's water footprint? Yes, but whether it'll happen is another thing altogether.\n\n\"What you can do technically is a completely different story from what will likely happen,\" De Vries told us, citing Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake, a blockchain consensus mechanism that uses far less energy to validate transactions. \"It's not an exaggeration to say this could all be solved tomorrow,\" De Vries added.\n\nIt's the Bitcoin community that De Vries sees as the biggest hurdle to jump in making its digicoin of choice more environmentally friendly. \"The Bitcoin community is extremely conservative and doesn't want to change anything about Bitcoin \u2013 its mechanism, transaction cap \u2013 anything,\" De Vries said. Bitcoiners, De Vries added, see their coin as a stable store of value because it isn't prone to making such drastic changes as switching its mechanism, \"and that's a sticking point.\"\n\nDe Vries cited recent EU cryptocurrency regulations that require disclosure of environmental impact as a way to lead to greater awareness of what it costs to keep the Bitcoin blockchain running, which he notes in the paper could spell serious problems for the world amid growing water scarcity.\n\nIn Kazakhstan, which became a large source of Bitcoin mining after China banned the practice, water shortages are already becoming a crisis, with climate change-exacerbated water shortages predicted to leave the country's capital 75 GL short of water by 2030. In 2021, Kazakhstani Bitcoin mining consumed around 1,000 GL of water, De Vries said.\n\n\"There's no obvious evidence that this is a concern within the BTC community,\" De Vries told us. \u00ae"

        "title": "Could Bitcoin Be Worth More Than $1 Trillion in 2024? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC -3.76%) up more than 125% this year, it's becoming increasingly possible that this high-flying crypto might surge through the $1 trillion valuation mark sometime next year. Given Bitcoin's circulating supply of roughly 20 million coins, a valuation of $1 trillion implies a price of about $50,000. This represents a 30% gain from today's price of almost $38,000.\n\nThat price target certainly seems possible, given that it wouldn't even require Bitcoin to regain its all-time high of almost $69,000. Could Bitcoin rally to $50,000 and top a $1 trillion valuation in the coming months? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF factor\n\nBitcoin's current rally has been driven, to a large extent, by investor anticipation of the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market. In June, BlackRock led the way with a spot Bitcoin ETF application. Within the span of just a few weeks, a handful of other large institutional investors were also lining up with their own spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The current thinking is that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could give its final approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF sometime in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThere are a number of useful back-of-the-envelope calculations that can be used to assess the impact of this approval. The easiest approach is to add up all the assets under management of the large institutional investors applying for these spot Bitcoin ETFs, and apply a scaling factor of, say, 1% to that number. That tells you how much new money might be flowing into Bitcoin. For example, if you assume that institutional investors will allocate just 1% of their $5 trillion in assets under management to Bitcoin, that would result in a new influx of $50 billion into Bitcoin.\n\nAnother approach is to consider Bitcoin from the perspective of a precious metal. Bitcoin is often described as \"digital gold,\" and many investors view it as a store of value, similar to physical gold. Thus, it's not out of the realm of possibility to think that some investors might move their assets out of precious metals and into Bitcoin. Right now, about $120 billion is held in precious metals ETFs. So, if you assume that anywhere from 10% to 20% of that might be reallocated to Bitcoin, that would result in a potential influx of anywhere from $12 billion to $24 billion. This new flow of money, presumably, would help to bid up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe global growth factor\n\nYou're probably thinking, \"That sounds great, but hasn't the market already priced in some, if not most, of the impact of a spot Bitcoin ETF?\" If you believe in the efficient market hypothesis, which says that the market has already priced in all known information, then you could be right. Coinbase Global, for example, has already run the numbers and concluded that some of the spot Bitcoin ETF impact might already have been priced in.\n\nThat's why I have a second big reason Bitcoin could rally to $50,000 and beyond in 2024: the global growth factor. In short, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly important part of the world's financial system, and that is leading to new demand for Bitcoin as an asset.\n\nIn its Big Ideas report for 2023, Ark Invest shared its forecast for several different market segments where it saw Bitcoin building momentum worldwide. By estimating how much of each market segment Bitcoin might command in the future, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest came up with a base, bear, and bull case scenario for Bitcoin for the year 2030.\n\nFor example, Wood calculated that, in a base case scenario, Bitcoin might account for 3% of the M2 money supply of emerging market countries, and 2.5% of the portfolio allocation of institutional investors. All of that led to a base case forecast of $682,800 for Bitcoin. So even if you dial back some of these numbers (such as changing the portfolio allocation percentage from 2.5% to 1%), you're still going to get a huge number. The bear case scenario for Bitcoin, says Wood, calls for a price of $258,500 by the year 2030.\n\nCan Bitcoin reach $50,000?\n\nGiven the above, I don't think $50,000 is an outlandish price target for Bitcoin. Especially given the fact that some analysts are already projecting that Bitcoin could top $100,000 by the end of 2024. Standard Chartered Bank, for example, recently doubled down on a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin.\n\nAt today's prices, a target of $50,000 requires only a 30% rise for Bitcoin. If you consider all the money that could be flowing into Bitcoin as a result of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, and then layer on top of that the overall growth that Bitcoin is seeing on a global basis, then Bitcoin might actually hit a $1 trillion market valuation in 2024. Just keep in mind, though, that given Bitcoin's historical volatility, that path to $1 trillion is likely to be filled with a bit of turbulence along the way. So buckle up."

If it is approved and converted, speculative traders will be able to pocket the difference between the current price and NAV.\n\n\u201cTo proxy the buying flow into [the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust] since the beginning of the year, we cumulate the daily signed dollar volume, i.e., the daily volume in thousands of shares times the price times the sign of the price change, positive if the price had increased over that day and negative if the price had decreased,\u201d JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a report on Nov. 16.\n\nPanigirtzoglou went on to say that \u201cthis methodology produces an estimate of around $2.5 billion for the net cumulative flow into [the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust] since the beginning of the year. This number increases to close to $2.7 billion if one also adds the covering of the short interest since the beginning of the year.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: All Time Best Crypto Brokers To Start Trading Right Now\n\nJPMorgan also said that the outflows could be even greater if the fees for the spot Bitcoin ETF are above the level of their competitors.\n\n\"We envisage a more intense competition with the average fee for Bitcoin ETFs converging towards that of Gold ETFs, which currently stands at around 50 basis points,\" according to the report.\n\nIf traders are indifferent between the several applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, they will likely go to the one with the lowest fees.

Bitcoin ended the month up about 9%, according to Coin Metrics. It was the underperformer, however, compared to ether , which advanced 13%, and Solana's sol token, which jumped 63%. Investors found relief after FTX's disgraced leader Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of criminal fraud \u2014 just about a year after the short-lived exchange's spectacular collapse \u2014 and the CEO of Binance, the largest exchange in the world, pleaded guilty to charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. For many, these events allowed them to close a painful chapter of crypto history as it prepares to open a new one. If a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund gets approved soon, it could bring a wave of new investors into the market who have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the industry to clean up. BTC.CM= 1M mountain Bitcoin closes November up 9% Now, traders are waiting in earnest. \"It's safe to say that the market is grinding higher in anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF approval in January,\" said Ryan Rasmussen, research analyst at Bitwise Asset Management. \"There's also the next bitcoin halving set to occur in May 2024, which is a strong catalyst for price that most people are missing as they're hyper-focused on a spot bitcoin ETF.\" \"Some investors will continue trying to front-run the potential spot bitcoin ETF approval, but December is essentially a 'wait and see' period for bitcoin,\" he said. Broad consensus is that an ETF is likely to be approved soon. Part of what's driving that optimism is reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has long held a reputation for being dismissive or unengaging with the crypto industry, appeared to make greater efforts in November by holding closed-door discussions with several ETF filers, giving them feedback and meeting with them again . November is a historically strong month for bitcoin. This is its seventh positive one out of the 11 since its inception, according to CoinGlass. December's track record isn't as rosy, however. CoinGlass says it has ended in the green in just four of the past 10. This year, however, it may give investors a good opportunity to buy one more dip before key events play out in the beginning of 2024. According to Wolfe Research, \"all signs\" point toward a near-term pullback in bitcoin's price, though there's plenty of upside left for it to run. November gains bring bitcoin up about 127% for 2023. Ether and sol have gained 70% and 482%, respectively, for the year. \"While this is part of a rotation we often see \u2014 a bitcoin rally, followed by an Ethereum rally, followed by a rally in altcoins \u2014 it's a telling signal for where we are in this next crypto cycle,\" Rasmussen said. \"It tells us that investors are interested in more than just the potential for a spot bitcoin ETF. They're looking ahead to 2024 and focusing on other narratives [and] recognize the potential for crypto to gain a meaningful share of investor attention next year.\""

        "content": "Billionaire crypto investor and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz is betting that by this time next year Bitcoin will be back at its highest levels ever.\n\nAnalysts at Bloomberg predict that the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved by Jan. 10, and Novogratz said that could drive billions of dollars into the sector, causing Bitcoin to skyrocket.\n\n\u201cCould we go to old highs by this time next year?\u201d Novogratz said during a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has been on a tear since September, shooting up 45%, to about $37,600, as of Wednesday, but the coin is still down from its all-time high of $69,000. Bitcoin reached that peak in November 2021 before falling below $16,000 a year later, according to data compiled by CoinGecko.\n\nNovogratz said making it easier to invest in cryptocurrencies via ETFs will help attract a fresh set of retail investors. Galaxy Digital is working with the investment management company Invesco to introduce a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cPrices are set on the margin, so that\u2019s all new money,\u201d Novogratz said. \u201cWe will see a pretty successful shift of psychology when the government says you are allowed to buy Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has still not approved a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. and has continually delayed making a decision on several applications. Earlier this year, the agency faced a setback on a lawsuit against crypto asset manager Grayscale regarding its application to create a spot Bitcoin ETF. The regulator chose not to appeal the ruling.\n\nStill, other high-profile leaders in traditional finance and the crypto space have recently renewed their optimism that Bitcoin will have a resurgence.\n\nOn Thursday, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor wrote in a post on X that the company had purchased an additional $593.3 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $36,785. MicroStrategy has now spent more than $5 billion on Bitcoin since 2020.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 16,130 BTC for ~$593.3 million at an average price of $36,785 per #bitcoin. As of 11/29/23, @MicroStrategy now hodls 174,530 $BTC acquired for ~$5.28 billion at an average price of $30,252 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/3XHhpIvsuA \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) November 30, 2023\n\nIn the traditional financial world, BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink has also compared Bitcoin to digital gold and called it an \u201cinternational asset.\u201d His comments pushed the coin to a 14-month high in July."

        "title": "The Average Bitcoin Transaction Wastes a Full Swimming Pool of Water, Scientists Say - Futurism",
        "content": "Yikes.\n\nDown the Drain\n\nEverytime Bitcoin is bought or sold, it wastes enough water to fill an entire swimming pool, new research shows, further evidence of the staggering environmental impact of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe research, a study published in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability, also found that Bitcoin's water footprint is rapidly escalating, rising by 166 percent between 2020 and 2021.\n\nNow, each transaction is estimated to expend over 16,000 liters of water. According to Alex de Vries from the Vrihe Universiteit Amsterdam, the study's sole author, that's around six million times more than what you use buying something with a credit card.\n\n\"It's sort of hard to surprise me, given how I've already worked on this topic I'm kind of used to big numbers popping up,\" de Vries told The Verge. \"But then again, the numbers are still mind blowing even to me every time I look at it.\"\n\nCool It\n\nGlobally, Bitcoin mining used about 1,600 gigaliters \u2014 that's a billion liters times 1,600 \u2014 in 2021, and the figure could be upwards of 2,200 gigaliters this year, with the US alone accounting for up to 35 gigaliters of that consumption. The steep increase will likely be driven by Bitcoin's climbing value, which encourages more mining.\n\nAn enormous amount of water is used to cool the tireless computers that mine and process Bitcoin around the clock. It's an intensive process that devours absurd amounts of energy \u2014 as much as a small country, in fact.\n\nThat energy bill figures into de Vries's calculations. Most of its water footprint comes from the water used in generating the electricity that Bitcoin burns through, though cooling systems still formed a massive part of the total proportion.\n\nLowering the Stakes\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way, according to de Vries. Most cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin use what's known as \"proof of work\" to validate transactions on the blockchain \u2014 the \"work\" being the mining done by those toasty computers \u2014 which is wildly inefficient.\n\n\"You have millions of devices around the world, constantly competing with each other in a massive game of what I like to describe as 'guess the number,'\" de Vries told the BBC. \"All of these machines combined are generating 500 quintillion guesses every second of the day, non stop \u2014 that is 500 with 18 zeros behind it.\"\n\nThere is at least one major cryptocurrency, however, that works around this: Ethereum, which last year started using \"proof of stake\" instead of work to validate transactions without any mining whatsoever, cutting its energy bill by 99 percent.\n\nShort of ditching crypto entirely, switching them over to more efficient systems could cause \"all the electricity consumption\" and \"associated water consumption\" to \"disappear overnight,\" de Vries told The Verge.\n\nBeyond that, using renewables and switching over to cooling methods that either recycle or don't use water at all could help soften crypto mining's grim environmental toll.\n\nMore on crypto: Execs of Top Meme Coin Charged With Spending Customers' Money on Luxury Cars"

        "content": "BTC was down by nearly 1% over the last 24 hours.\n\nSocial metrics were high, but other indicators looked bearish.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] has not been very volatile of late, as its price took a sideways trajectory. As AMBCrypto reported earlier, investors might have to expect a few more slow-moving days, which was further established by the latest datasets.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin\u2019s MACD and Money Flow Index (MFI) looked bearish. But can anything cause a change in the trend in the near term?\n\nBitcoin might not get volatile\n\nIntoTheBlock recently posted a tweet highlighting that the 30-day average intraday move for Bitcoin was going lower than traditional markets. This indicated a period of relatively low volatility for BTC.\n\nMoreover, AMBCrypto found that while BTC\u2019s price went sideways, its Open Interest remained relatively high. High Open Interest generally indicates that the ongoing price trend might continue further.\n\nHas anything changed overnight?\n\nThough BTC did not register much movement, investors continued to accumulate at press time. This was evident from the fact that BTC\u2019s Exchange Outflow spiked in the recent past.\n\nOn top of that, BTC\u2019s Supply on Exchanges remained lower than its Supply outside of Exchanges, suggesting that buying pressure on the coin was higher than selling pressure, reflecting investors\u2019 confidence in the king of cryptos.\n\nThings looked good for BTC on the social front too, as its Social Dominance surged by more than 50% over the last week. But despite the sluggish price movement, Bitcoin\u2019s Market Dominance registered an increase, which looked optimistic.\n\nHowever, a bearish metric was the coin\u2019s AltRank, which increased over the last seven days.\n\nWhen AMBCrypto checked BTC\u2019s daily chart, we found that not much had changed over the last few hours. The MACD continued to show an ongoing tussle between the bulls and the bears at press time.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe Bollinger Bands\u2019 data also revealed that the coin\u2019s price was in a less volatile zone.\n\nHowever, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) went sideways, but its Money Flow Index (MFI) looked bullish as it moved up slightly in the recent past. At press time, BTC was trading at $37,787.55, with a market capitalization of over $739 billion."

        "title": "How the Winklevoss Twins' Bitcoin-Based Second Act Went Bad - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nIn early June 2019, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss invited the author Ben Mezrich to a private get-together at the Park Avenue South headquarters of their crypto exchange, Gemini, an office where the money and ambition of the digital currency world were on outlandish display: A giant chrome statue reminiscent of the MTV Moon Man trophy hung from the ceiling; employees were called \u201castronauts\u201d; the C-suite was referred to as \u201cmission control.\u201d Mezrich, of course, was a key figure in the Winklevosses\u2019 lives. As the author of The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal \u2014 the 2009 book that became The Social Network \u2014 he had helped define them, before their 30th birthdays, as spoiled Ivy League monozygotic brats who got rich thanks to their dad\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThe Winklevii aren\u2019t suing me for intellectual property theft,\u201d Jesse Eisenberg, playing the Mark Zuckerberg character, says in one of the movie\u2019s key lines. \u201cThey are suing me because, for the first time in their lives, things didn\u2019t go exactly the way they were supposed to for them.\u201d\n\nYet, ten years later, Mezrich was hawking his new book, Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption, casting the twins as heroes \u2014 to their own employees. \u201cThat was a weird day,\u201d one onlooker said. Attendance was optional, but the midday event did have pizza, and who doesn\u2019t love pizza, so dozens showed up. The twins seemed relaxed, far from their normally stiff selves, two others said. \u201cI remember them asking what Ben\u2019s process was, and him saying, \u2019I write books I can turn into movies,\u2019\u201d a fourth attendee said. What was so strange about the whole thing is that Mezrich\u2019s book hardly even mentions Gemini. Then, after it was all over, the twins asked their employees to grab a free copy and form a line, so all three of them \u2014 the author and his dual protagonists \u2014 could all sign the book.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins have, for the better part of a decade, been trying to convince the world they made a comeback. For anyone who stopped paying attention to them after the Facebook movie came out, here\u2019s the general trajectory: The $65 million settlement from Zuckerberg over their claims to the Facebook idea turned into a major bet on bitcoin, back when the digital currency traded for about $8. (Lately it trades around $38,000.) Gemini, which they started in 2014, was supposed to be their legacy \u2014 a highly profitable business that would not only cement their status as serious players in the growing crypto industry. If everything went right, it had the potential to be a $100 billion company of their own. In an often sketchy or even scammy sector plagued by hacks and FBI raids, they branded themselves as rule followers using financial best practices to create a dependable \u201cnext generation\u201d exchange that wealthy investors and institutions could rely on as they got involved in crypto investing. They would be the kind of entrepreneurs who would work with government regulators even as much of the rest of the industry tried to avoid oversight. \u201cIn the beginning of Gemini\u2019s history, we were very focused on asking permission, and not asking for forgiveness,\u201d a former executive said. \u201cWe always acted on the expectation of how regulators would want us to work.\u201d\n\nGemini is, of course, a reference to twins, as well as a NASA space flight \u2014 but any astrologer could tell you that geminis have a tendency for saying one thing and doing another. Last month, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the Winklevosses\u2019 exchange, claiming that it defrauded 290,000 people out of $1.1 billion worth of crypto. The suit presented a company that was not only willing to overlook its own internal concerns about a partner firm that was holding a huge chunk of its customers\u2019 deposits but to continue representing to those customers that their money was secure even as the board was privately comparing this partner to Lehman Brothers in 2008. Interviews with nine sources, together with court records, reveal a company that began taking larger and larger risks as it attempted to keep up with competitors like FTX and Binance, both of which later ran spectacularly afoul of law. (None of the sources are being named since they continue to work in the industry and fear getting sued for talking about the companies.) That frantic chase is said to have led Gemini to stray from the rule-following conservatism that was the original cornerstone of the brand. Now that they\u2019ve been accused of lying to their customers \u2014 and their exchange has fallen out of the top 100 by global trading volume \u2014 the twins are facing the most consequential test to their credibility yet.\n\nAfter their famous Facebook settlement, the Winklevosses made some questionable investments. There was Treats!, a porn magazine, in 2014. There was Hukkster, an online retailer, soon after. Cameron co-founded \u201cGuest of a Guest,\u201d a \u201cPage Six\u201d knockoff. But their bitcoin bet was an unqualified jackpot. As Mezrich describes in his more recent book, it began at an Ibiza foam party called F@@k Me I\u2019m Famous. A man they\u2019d never met buttonholed them about \u201cthe oldest social network on earth.\u201d He was talking about money, specifically in the form of the digital currency, and the twins were hooked. They bought up about 1 percent of all the bitcoin in the world. At first, they tried to turn their investment into a kind of company of its own, the world\u2019s first exchange-traded fund for bitcoins. This would give the investing public an easy way to make the digital currency part of their 401(k)s \u2014 all for a small fee \u2014 but their applications were repeatedly denied by federal regulators.\n\nStill, Gemini was their biggest idea. Following the 2014 debacle of Mt. Gox \u2014 the largest bitcoin exchange in the world until it was hacked and robbed \u2014 there was a strong appetite for reliable crypto companies. \u201cIt was super exciting,\u201d an early executive said of Gemini\u2019s formative years. \u201cI was working my ass off and I loved it.\u201d Early on, the twins went out of their way to involve the New York Department of Financial Services, a historically nosy Wall Street regulator, and by 2015 would be one of the first to get a charter allowing it to operate in the state.\n\nThe business plan was to be one step ahead of Wall Street. As the hedge funds and Goldman Sachses of the world discovered crypto, the thinking went, Gemini would already be there, an inviting gateway into this new realm. Gemini was scrupulous about following the rules, employees said. In addition to working with New York regulators, the Winklevoss brothers would fly to Europe to meet with the financial authorities there. Gemini\u2019s ad campaigns had taglines like \u201cCrypto Without Chaos\u201d and \u201cThe Revolution Needs Rules.\u201d Whenever Gemini wanted to list a new digital currency for customers to trade, it informed the Department of Financial Services ahead of time, giving the regulators the chance to register an objection. Most times, DFS officials would either approve the request or decline to act against them \u2014 which, in effect, was seen to be the same thing, according to people familiar with the inner workings of the company. Generally, this plan worked. By 2019, Gemini had captured about 5 percent of the U.S. crypto exchange market \u2014 a small, but valuable, slice of a rich new industry.\n\nIn a wonderful twist of irony, Gemini nearly captured the business of a certain blockbuster client: Zuckerberg. Starting in 2018, the Facebook founder wanted to launch his own cryptocurrency, called Libra. At one point, according to three people directly familiar with the plans, Libra\u2019s parent company was preparing to issue the digital currency through Gemini. Gemini employees had figured that DFS regulators were fine with it after hearing nothing back from a proposal. \u201cIt technically was approved,\u201d said one person. The PR value of the plan would have been hard to overstate \u2014 here were the twins, getting back into business with their onetime nemesis, letting bygones go on a grand quest to get insanely rich. It was only after informing regulators again \u2014 extra safe, by the rules \u2014 that they raised concerns about the launch. Libra encountered further regulatory scrutiny after that, particularly on concerns that Facebook was too big, and was quietly euthanized in 2022.\n\nIn the months preceding the pandemic, ex-employees told me, something began to change. Their market share was not growing. Their biggest U.S. competitor, Coinbase, was becoming the go-to exchange. \u201cWe felt like we were missing out,\u201d one ex-employee said. Abroad, the growth was even bigger. Binance, which had no headquarters (and thus no obvious regulatory obligations), had cemented itself as the world\u2019s largest exchange. Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX was also growing rapidly from its offshore outpost in Hong Kong, before relocating to an even friendlier jurisdiction in the Bahamas (where it would commit its epic $14 billion fraud). Inside Gemini, the bet on institutional customers appeared to be going nowhere. Goldman wasn\u2019t giving them real business, and they were getting as much as they\u2019d hoped from hedge funds, insiders said.\n\nIn 2020, the twins decided it was time for a pivot. They no longer wanted Gemini to be just an exchange where customers traded crypto. Instead, it would look more like a consumer bank, selling lots of financial products \u2014 credit cards, bank accounts, maybe even mortgages, one ex-employee said. At the center of that was a top-secret project called Earn, which would basically act like a high-yield checking account, except for crypto holdings instead of cash. \u201cWe would have this savings-like account. That\u2019s how we viewed it internally, even though we never ever say that publicly anywhere, because we knew that we weren\u2019t allowed to say that,\u201d one person directly involved with the program said. It was an aggressive move to offer the general public a brand new interest-bearing product without clear regulatory approval \u2014 and this time Gemini didn\u2019t ask the Department of Financial Services for permission ahead of time, according to two people familiar with the approval process. To knowledgeable observers in the crypto world, the logic of the Winklevosses\u2019 strategy shift toward riskier and more aggressive product offerings was obvious enough. \u201cThey were hemorrhaging market share,\u201d said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin, a digital currency financial services company. \u201cIn an effort to stay alive, they basically did exactly what SBF did, which was go after retail deposits.\u201d\n\nEarn worked by, essentially, connecting Gemini\u2019s generally conservative customers and some of crypto\u2019s wildest risk-takers. Gemini depositors could opt to put their crypto (say, their bitcoin or ethereum) in a special account that would pay them interest \u2014 as much as an 8 percent annualized \u2014 on the balance. For many depositors, it seemed like an easy way to make a little extra income while they waited for their crypto bags to moon. But, of course, the yield had to come from somewhere. At a traditional bank, a checking account yield comes from the bank lending out those same funds at a higher rate of interest. In the case of Earn, Gemini would lend out their customers\u2019 crypto to other players in the industry (with crypto speculation at a fever pitch, there was a strong institutional demand to borrow crypto for trading) for a higher rate of interest than it ultimately paid to its customers. If everything went smoothly, it was win-win.\n\nInside Gemini, people involved said, the whole process of setting up the program took nearly a year, and involved intense debates about what kind of interest rates they should offer and whether they should lend out the crypto to multiple partners or only one. Gemini\u2019s product managers considered partnering with a handful of lenders, including two companies that were successful doing what Earn aimed to do, paying retail investors interest on their crypto holdings by lending them other institutions. One was BlockFi, a firm that the twins had already invested in. The other was Celsius, a competitor. While the two firms appeared to be doing very well during the crypto bull market of 2020 and 2021, both would collapse in 2022 with their customers losing everything they had deposited. (Celsius\u2019s founder, Alex Mashinsky, has since been charged with criminal fraud, and his trial is set for September 2024.)\n\nWhen Earn was publicly announced in February 2021, Gemini\u2019s press release did not mention any lending partner and instead touted its own safety and reliability \u201con par with those offered by top financial institutions,\u201d the company said. The company it chose as a partner was Genesis Trading, a big institutional player in the crypto space. Like Gemini, it was based in New York City and a related entity, Genesis Capital, was regulated by state watchdogs. Genesis was also a subsidiary of one of the companies that helped create the crypto industry, Digital Currency Group. The parent company was sitting on the world\u2019s largest bitcoin horde (over 600,000 of them, held as part of a lucrative publicly tradable product called the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust). Because Genesis was overseen by such a big moneymaker \u2014 DCG booked more than $1 billion in revenue in 2021 \u2014 it was considered about as creditworthy as you could get in the crypto business.\n\nEarn was a surprise hit and quickly became the Winklevoss twins\u2019 biggest product. In the first two weeks, according to internal metrics, it brought in $500 million in deposits; a month later, Gemini had made $1 million in fees. By June, the internal data showed, 73 percent of the customers had 99 percent of their money in Earn. Gemini depositors loved it because they earn high interest rates for doing basically nothing, all while working with the \u201ccrypto without the chaos\u201d company. \u201cGemini has always had a reputation for being a trustworthy and secure platform,\u201d said one Earn depositor, Glen, who asked to have his full name withheld for security reasons and because his family doesn\u2019t know. \u201cI trusted Gemini and assumed that any partnerships they had would be equally trustworthy.\u201d On the back of that success and a booming market generally for all things crypto, Gemini reached a valuation topping $7 billion. The twins made the Forbes billionaires list, with $6 billion between them.\n\nStill, some Gemini employees were concerned. They thought that the crypto industry was too dependent on Genesis remaining stable and managing its risks intelligently. For skeptics, it looked like it could be a systemic point of failure in a larger crypto collapse. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know that Genesis was the counterparty to every interest-bearing crypto product, you were not paying attention,\u201d one former Gemini employee told me. But an executive overseeing the project \u201cwould repeatedly say that he thought that their financials were very strong and that they are blue chip or whatever. He seemed to think that they were trustworthy.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Genesis Trading wasn\u2019t trustworthy. Internal records revealed during the criminal trial of Bankman-Fried showed that Genesis didn\u2019t play by anything resembling the rules of a traditional financial firm. For instance, the company routinely approved billions of dollars in loans over Signal chats. One former loan officer said that confidential information was kept unsecured on the company\u2019s servers. \u201cOur credit risk team was a sham. I don\u2019t know what they were doing,\u201d said another ex-employee. \u201cThey had no risk reporting at all,\u201d said a third. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a way to look at the portfolio very easily.\u201d By early 2022, Genesis had discovered that about 60 percent of all its loans were concentrated in Bankman-Fried\u2019s hedge fund, Alameda Research \u2013 which, of course, would blow up spectacularly before the end of the year.\n\nGemini was not unaware of the risks it was taking by parking a huge chunk of its customers\u2019 funds with Genesis, according to ex-employees and court documents. The attorney general\u2019s office alleged that Gemini\u2019s risk team had downgraded Genesis\u2019s risk level to junk status by February 2022. In the spring of that year, a Genesis employee privately met with Jared Shaw, Gemini\u2019s head of finance, to tell him about how concentrated Genesis was in Alameda. (Shaw hadn\u2019t responded to a request for comment prior to publication. Afterwards, he said \u201cI had no private meetings or met with anyone at Genesis while at Gemini.\u201d)\n\nAs 2022 rolled on, everything was starting to come apart \u2014 fast. In May, two of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrencies, TerraUSD and Luna, collapsed, instantly evaporating $60 billion from the larger crypto economy. A month later, the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital went under, defaulting on more than $3 billion in obligations \u2014 including $2.3 billion in loans from Genesis, according to court records. According to the attorney general\u2019s suit, this nearly led to Genesis\u2019s bankruptcy. DCG, its parent company, issued a promissory note that appeared to plug a $1.1 billion hole in its balance sheet, though no money was actually exchanged. (One former Genesis employee said that the flimsy nature of DCG\u2019s support\ufeff was not known among rank-and-file employees at Genesis.)\n\nAt Gemini, the steep decline in crypto markets following the Terra-Luna and Three Arrows debacles only appeared to make the twins more remote. In January 2022, the twins had hired a new chief technology officer, Pravjit Tiwana, from Amazon. Seen internally as a likely candidate to one day run the exchange, Tiwana favored the kind of move-fast-and-break-things model that Silicon Valley ran on, dismantling the company\u2019s quality assurance team, and pushing out several of the most experienced people on the risk team, former employees said. Tiwana was widely unpopular among those who\u2019d helped build the company in its early years, particularly for weekly, companywide presentations where, ex-employees said, he and his lieutenants would grill employees on why they hadn\u2019t hit goals that seemed far out of reach. (Tiwana left the company on November 15.) After laying off 10 percent of Gemini\u2019s workforce in June, the twins went on a band tour, where they would play covers of Rage Against the Machine and Blink-182, among others. In one widely circulated clip of their set, they couldn\u2019t quite remember the words to \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d:\n\nuh so i saw the winklevoss twins' band? tonight? like, it's really them pic.twitter.com/xVqYwQrztL \u2014 maggie ;) (@arch_nem) June 10, 2022\n\nMeanwhile, the problems with Earn were growing more obvious inside the company. Requests from Gemini risk officers for standard disclosures \u2014 like who Genesis was loaning money to \u2014 went unanswered, two people said. According to the New York attorney general\u2019s lawsuit, Gemini knew that Genesis wouldn\u2019t have the money to pay back its loans if it went under. Cameron said during a board meeting that Genesis was \u201clying about financials.\u201d A lawsuit that Gemini would later file against the lender claims that Genesis gave them \u201cfalsified balance sheets and other financial reports, which falsely indicated that [Genesis] was solvent when in reality it was not.\u201d\n\nOn October 13, Gemini gave Genesis 30 days notice that it would end the Earn program, court documents show. However, according to the attorney general\u2019s suit, Gemini never stopped promoting Earn on its website and continued to funnel money into the soon-to-be bankrupt lender. Before those 30 days were up, Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire collapsed, revealing his extensive criminal fraud and sending crypto markets into freefall. Simultaneously, the true extent of Genesis\u2019s risky lending was exposed. With so many loans concentrated with Alameda, Genesis was insolvent and soon after declared bankruptcy. When it did so, the $900 million in Earn customer funds that it controlled immediately became frozen \u2014 as they remain today. (Since those funds are invested in crypto and those markets are up dramatically in 2023, the overall value of the Gemini customer assets trapped with Genesis is now more than $1.1 billion.)\n\nIn the wake of the collapse, the twins tried to come to a settlement with DCG and its founder and CEO, billionaire and longtime crypto-Twitter troll Barry Silbert. During these negotiations, four people who were either inside one of the companies or were briefed on the discussions directly were told that Silbert and the twins discussed paying back customers some portion of their deposits immediately \u2014 but less than what they\u2019d deposited. The payments would have taken the form of shares of DCG\u2019s Grayscale Bitcoin Trust \u2014 which the twins\u2019 exchange had secured in collateral, according to the suit filed against Genesis by Gemini.\n\nThe talks collapsed in December, and soon after, one of Gemini\u2019s attorneys, Niels Gjertsen, left the company. (Gjertsen declined to comment.) The twins would soon take their fight against Silbert to Twitter, and add to their portfolio of lawsuits when they sued Genesis in Manhattan federal bankruptcy court for more shares of the bitcoin trust. (The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit accusing both companies of other financial violations that month.) Silbert\u2019s company has claimed that Gemini\u2019s suit is a \u201cpublicity stunt,\u201d while Gemini is accusing its former lending partner of basically stealing from Earn customers. With the dispute playing out in court, Gemini\u2019s Earn customers are still in limbo. Their assets show up in their accounts, but they are unable to access them. The day before Thanksgiving things got even worse: Genesis filed a suit seeking to claw back $689 million from Gemini customers who were able to get their money out before the collapse, making it less clear when or whether the other customers will ever be able to do so. (It\u2019s also unclear whether, should the customers ever get paid back, it would be in current crypto prices, or the dollar amount of assets at the time of the bankruptcy, which were much lower.)\n\nMultiple former Gemini employees expressed frustration at what they saw as a mishandling by the Winklevoss brothers of a situation that didn\u2019t need to leave the exchanges customers stranded and fearful of losing their assets. Among the victims are a 79-year-old grandmother who, according to the attorney general\u2019s suit, invested her husband\u2019s entire $199,000 savings into the program. She \u201chad hoped to use this money to pay for her grandchild\u2019s education. Outside of her Earn investment, she and her husband have little savings,\u201d according to the suit. Glen, the depositor, declined to say how much he put into Earn but said that he\u2019s had to delay a medical procedure because his money is frozen. \u201cAs for Gemini, I do believe they bear some responsibility, considering they were the ones offering and promoting the Earn program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems only fair that they should cover at least a portion of the deposits to help mitigate the losses for users like myself.\u201d\n\nThe twins are fighting the New York State charges against their business. Silbert is doing the same. (While Silbert was named as a defendant in the attorney general\u2019s suit, the Winklevosses were not. Representatives from Gemini and Genesis didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.) Regardless of the outcome, the Winklevosses\u2019 big opportunity appears to have passed them by. Coinbase, its largest U.S. competitor, saw 42 times more trading volume than Gemini on one recent November day, according to publicly available data. Its CEO, Brian Armstrong, has already cast himself as the most trustworthy major crypto CEO left. \u201cWe now have an opportunity to start a new chapter for this industry,\u201d he recently said on X. In fact, the new chapter looks a lot like the vision that the twins first pitched before the last bubble burst.\n\nIn the crypto world, investors are preparing for another boom. Bitcoin has more than doubled off its 2022 lows. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is on the verge of offering its own bitcoin and ethereum ETFs \u2014 the very thing the Winklevosses tried to do a decade ago. JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., plans on issuing its cryptocurrency during the next year or so. Rather than scramble to win back a potential new wave of institutional business, the twins are, at least publicly, lamenting that they ever played by the rules at all. \u201cWe spent years doing things the right way, going in the front door, asking permission not forgiveness,\u201d Cameron \u2014 or is it Tyler? \u2014 said in a June Instagram post. \u201cAnd honestly, at this point, it\u2019s unclear what good it\u2019s done for us.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated to include a comment from Jared Shaw denying meeting with any Genesis employees, and to clarify the timeline of the Genesis bankruptcy proceedings."

        "title": "What Was the Silk Road Online? History and Closure by FBI - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Was Silk Road?\n\nSilk Road was a digital black market platform that was popular for hosting money laundering activities and illegal drug transactions using Bitcoin. Silk Road, regarded as the first darknet market, was launched in 2011 and eventually shut down by the FBI in 2013. It was founded by Ross William Ulbricht, who is now serving a life sentence in prison for his role in Silk Road.\n\nSince that time, several other darknet markets have risen.\n\nKey Takeaways The Silk Road was an online black market where buyers and sellers of illegal or unethical items could transact anonymously.\n\nUtilizing privacy techniques such as the Tor network and cryptocurrency transactions, people were able to transact in drugs, hacked passwords, illegal data, and other contraband.\n\nThe FBI shut down Silk Road in 2013, and its founder, Ross Ulbricht, was sentenced to prison for life.\n\nUnderstanding Silk Road\n\nThe digital era has brought many technological innovations to our home fronts and created lifestyles that were unthinkable at the turn of the century. We can now conduct transactions online with ecommerce sites, pay for online transactions using virtual currency, get loans online using social lending sites, operate anonymously on the web using data anonymization technology, and even connect with company recruiters using social media sites. The list of digital technology inventions goes on and ventures into every sector of the world's economy.\n\nWhat Lead to Its Creation?\n\nAn increase in the use of cyber technology like cryptocurrency and ecommerce marketplaces led to an increase in the demand for data privacy. Demand for privacy increased regulation and laws over how data is used; additionally, an increase in technological tools and platforms was created to serve users who prefer to live more anonymously. While the initiation of data anonymization tools helps protect users' personally identifiable information (PII), these tools are also used by entities who intend to conduct illegal and criminal activities. In 2011, the Silk Road was born out of a need to connect illicit drug sellers with interested buyers online while protecting their identities and transactions using anonymization techniques.\n\nThrough a combination of data anonymization technology, a trading platform, and a feedback system, Silk Road created a haven for drug traders. The site was accessible only through a network known as Tor, which exists mainly to anonymize user data and activities online. Tor obfuscates users' addresses so they appear hidden from unwanted parties looking to surveil the users' transactions and activities\u2014in other words, Silk Road, Tor, and cryptocurrency was the ultimate privacy toolkit for illegal operations.\n\nBitcoin is designed to be anonymous, with only the wallet's public address displayed on the blockchain. If the wallet owner doesn't want to be associated with the address, there isn't any way to identify them if they don't reveal themselves some other way. Addresses with questionable transactions are monitored by authorities for activity, which is how many illegal transactions using cryptocurrency are identified.\n\nPrivacy and Feedback\n\nSome Silk Road buyers and sellers brazenly conducted illegal drug transactions without fear because their IP addresses could not be traced back to them. Another reason Silk Road thrived was the buyer feedback system implemented on the platform. Buyers would normally provide feedback on sellers after receiving their goods. The feedback received was then used by the site to weed out fraudulent sellers, while reputable sellers had their products highly sought after. This promoted buyer confidence in the online platform.\n\nAll trades on Silk Road were conducted using the virtual currency known as Bitcoin. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public ledger, which is easily surveilled by legal and regulatory bodies.\n\nThe Fall of Silk Road\n\nThe Silk Road came to its demise in 2013 after the FBI learned about the existence of the hidden marketplace and colluded with the DEA, IRS, and Customs agents. Although the federal agents admitted that the use of Tor and Bitcoin to obscure addresses were significant obstacles that they encountered, they were still able to crack down on the underground drug market.\n\nThe FBI shut down the site permanently, seized more than 144,000 bitcoins (then valued at $34 million), and arrested several users of the site, including the founder, Ross Ulbricht, who made about $80 million in commissions from transactions carried out within the site. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 and is currently serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\nDoes the Silk Road Still Exist Today? The Silk Road, as it was before being taken down in 2013, no longer exists. However, the dark web is still operating, and most things found on Silk Road are available via various venues. Authorities continue to crack down on illegal operations.\n\nWhat Happened to the Bitcoins Seized From Silk Road? More than 144,000 were recovered at the time of the takedown. But in 2022, James Zhong pled guilty and was convicted of wire fraud. IRS special agents recovered more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency from his home, stolen from Silk Road in 2012.\n\nDoes Ross Ulbricht Still Have Bitcoin? Ulbricht is still in prison as of 2023 and no longer has any bitcoin unless it is hidden somewhere and agents did not find it.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSilk Road was the name of a platform used on the dark web to sell illegal goods, providing anonymity for those who required it for their activities. Federal agents took the site down, and the founder was arrested in 2013.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Bitcoin is the world's most popular cryptocurrency, and it has seen a wave of price fluctuations over the years. At times, Bitcoin's value has soared to unprecedented heights. However, it has also seen significant drops in value, leaving investors cautious and wondering about the critical factors behind these fluctuations. Throughout this article, we will explore these Bitcoin price fluctuations in detail, providing investors in Indiana and beyond a better understanding of what makes the cryptocurrency tick.\n\nAnalyzing Bitcoin's market sentiment\n\nMarket sentiment is one of the driving forces behind Bitcoin price fluctuations. For example, when investors are optimistic about Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, the Bitcoin price in USD tends to increase in value. On the other hand, when there is negative market sentiment from investors or the public, the cost of Bitcoin tends to fall. But what factors influence market sentiment? News reports, social media posts from prominent figures, market trends, and regulatory changes can affect cryptocurrency.\n\nDecoding Bitcoin's regulatory shifts\n\nGovernment's outlook on cryptocurrencies is an ever-changing landscape, with countries worldwide having opposing views on digital currencies, and this can have massive implications on the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. For example, in 2021, China banned cryptocurrency trading and mining, leading to a drop in Bitcoin's price; this stance has been kept up in 2023 with Beijing-based social media app Weibo removing 80 popular crypto influencers from its platform. However, other countries have a more positive outlook on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For example, El Salvador became the first country to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender, driving its price up.\n\nBitcoin's vulnerability to market manipulation\n\nBitcoin and the cryptocurrency market to which it belongs are vulnerable to market manipulation. For example, some investors and traders use tactics like pump and dumps and spoofing and wash trading schemes to manipulate the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, this can lead to sudden drops and spikes in Bitcoin's price, harming the general opinion of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin's market rivals\n\nAnother critical factor to discuss and understand when exploring Bitcoin's price fluctuations is its competition from other cryptocurrencies. For example, Bitcoin faces stiff competition from other emerging cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Cardano, which offer different benefits and features. This can lead to investors choosing other cryptocurrencies over Bitcoin as their sole market investments, leading to Bitcoin's price decline.\n\nEconomic drivers in Bitcoin's market\n\nBitcoin's price fluctuations are also affected by the economy as a whole in the United States. For example, inflation and global economic conditions like recessions and interest rates can all affect Bitcoin's price. These factors can make investors change their focus to markets that are more traditional and other investments, hurting Bitcoin's price. Nevertheless, Bitcoin did see a remarkable rise in its price during 2020, when there was a global pandemic, US-China tensions, and Brexit in the United Kingdom. These are all factors that would usually make investors wary.\n\nEnvironmental concerns in Bitcoin mining\n\nFurthermore, concerns have been raised over the energy consumed during Bitcoin mining and its environmental impact. For example, environmental groups such as Greenpeace have called out financial management and payment process companies that have ventured into Bitcoin mining. This has led to more people opting out of investing in Bitcoin due to their ecological beliefs and the scrutiny they may face for supporting it, which, in turn, has led to a decline in Bitcoin's price.\n\nSummarizing Bitcoin's price fluctuations\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin's price is affected by environmental concerns in Bitcoin mining, economic drivers like inflation, cryptocurrency market rivals, market manipulation, regulatory shifts from governments, and market sentiment. This makes it crucial for investors to watch the latest news reports and trends regarding cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin to make more informed investment decisions.\n\nInformation is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice.

        "title": "Research the dynamics of market manipulation before you jump in Bitcoin ETFs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Investors are eagerly anticipating the potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The excitement began in early June when the investment giant BlackRock submitted a filing for the product and gained further momentum after a court decision mandated the SEC reconsider its rejection of Grayscale's proposal to transform its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s objection to ETFs is related to the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) is traded in unregulated venues around the world, which poses a challenge in preventing fraud and price manipulation.\n\nOne attempt to address the issue has included surveillance-sharing agreements (SSA) with some cryptocurrency exchanges. In theory, this would allow the identification of bad actors who attempt to manipulate the market. Critics question the efficacy of these SSAs given they cannot cover the entire market. ETFs are based on precedent decisions that allowed spot commodity ETFs based on the relevance of the underlying commodity futures markets.\n\nRelated: With Bitcoin\u2019s halving months away, it may be time to go risk-on\n\nThe SEC has established that the futures should lead the spot in price formation in order to be considered a \u201cregulated market of significant size.\u201d In other words, information from the futures market takes precedence over the spot market in the price discovery process. Yet, even if price discovery is led by the futures market, there are still some cases where manipulation in the spot markets can spread to the ETF. The devil is in the details, and more specifically, in the price source for the net asset value (NAV) calculation and in the creations and redemptions method (in-cash or in-kind).\n\nConsider a scenario where a manipulator successfully drives the underlying commodity price down by 5% in unregulated spot markets.\n\nA 2019 Bitwise report on using volume-weighted median price to protect against manipulation of the NAV. Source: Bitwise\n\nIf the creations and redemptions are in-kind, there is a straightforward arbitrage that acts like communicating vessels between the ETF and the unregulated spot markets. In this example, the arbitrageur can exploit it by simply buying underpriced spot commodity and selling the corresponding amount of the ETF, and then using the bought commodity to create new ETF units and cover the short ETF position. The profitability of this trade will last until there is a substantial convergence of the spot commodity price and the equivalent amount of the ETF. How much each price will move toward the convergence depends on their liquidity, but some of the adjustment will come from the ETF price, meaning that the manipulation in the spot market spreads to the ETF, at least in part.\n\nIn a case where the creations and redemptions are in cash and the NAV is calculated with commodity prices derived from the unregulated spot markets, a very similar arbitrage is possible. The arbitrageur buys underpriced spot commodity and sells the ETF, uses cash to create ETF units to cover the short position and sells the commodity trying to replicate the pricing methodology used in the NAV calculation (which determines the price paid for the creations). Apart from worse capital efficiency (due to cash disbursement for creation) and a small execution risk when replicating the NAV price, the trade is basically the same as with in-kind creation and the consequences are similar.\n\nRelated: Futures will be the best crypto game in town even after a Bitcoin spot ETF\n\nIs there a setup that effectively shields the ETF from manipulation? The use of spot prices derived from the futures curve for calculating NAV, coupled with in-cash creations and redemptions, emerges as the most promising alternative. If an arbitrageur attempts to apply the same method as in the previous case, there is no guarantee of selling the commodity at a price similar to that used in NAV calculation, especially in the presence of a manipulator in the spot market. The trade is no longer an arbitrage. The pipes connecting the spot price and the ETF price are obstructed.\n\nOn the flip side, this setup facilitates a straightforward arbitrage path between the ETF and futures. Whenever the ETF price diverges from the spot price implied by the futures curve, an arbitrageur can execute a trade in the opposite position with perfect hedging on futures, establishing a robust link between the ETF and the futures market. It is reasonable to believe that an ETF with such characteristics would be as resistant to manipulation in unregulated spot markets as the futures contracts or a futures ETF.\n\nBoth academics and practitioners have already found some robust evidence supporting the idea that CME Bitcoin Futures are dominant in Bitcoin\u2019s price discovery. Undoubtedly, a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. would be a good development for the traditional markets and the crypto industry. As the American pastor Chuck Swindoll once said, \"The difference between something good and something great is attention to detail.\" By keeping the devils away, a Bitcoin ETF has the potential to be truly great for investors.\n\nJo\u00e3o Marco Braga da Cunha is the portfolio manager at Hashdex.

        "content": "Swiss asset manager Pando Asset has become an unexpected late entrant into the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) race in the United States.\n\nOn the same day, investment giant BlackRock met with the country\u2019s securities regulator to pitch an updated ETF model based on the agency\u2019s feedback.\n\nOn Nov. 29, Pando submitted a Form S-1 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u2014 used to register securities with the agency \u2014 for the Pando Asset Spot Bitcoin Trust.\n\nLike other ETF bids, the trust aims to track Bitcoin\u2019s price with the custody arm of the crypto exchange Coinbase to hold Bitcoin on behalf of the trust.\n\nPando is the 13th applicant for an approved spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. and joins the race with a dozen others, including BlackRock, ARK Invest and Grayscale.\n\nIn a Nov. 29 X (formerly Twitter) post, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he has \u201cmore questions than answers\u201d about Pando\u2019s filing, questioning why it came so late.\n\nmore questions than answers: where have they been for last 3mo? why bother at this point? if they make Jan 10 crew what does that say about fair play and even society as we know it?

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -3.54% mining pool AntPool has agreed to refund the record-breaking $3 million transaction fee it mined last week, pending owner verification.\n\n\u201cOn November 23rd, some user submitted 83 BTC as a gas fee,\u201d AntPool wrote in the announcement. \u201cThe risk control system of AntPool temporarily froze the fee when packaging the transaction. Please contact us before 00:00 (UTC+8) on December 10, 2023 and verify personal identity. After verification, AntPool will refund the fee.\u201d\n\nAntPool requested the original owner of the funds to prepare a signing tool, such as Electrum or Bitcoin Core \u2014 the most widely used software implementation of the Bitcoin protocol \u2014 using the private key of the address that sent the transaction to sign the message \u201cAntPool\u201d, then send the signed text to its support email address.\n\nRecord-breaking $3 million fee\n\nLast week, a Bitcoin user appeared to have accidentally paid the transaction fee of over $3 million last week, setting a new record in U.S. dollar terms for a single Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe transaction paid 83.65 BTC ($3.1 million) to transfer 55.77 BTC ($2.1 million). The pre-transaction balance was 139.42 BTC ($5.2 million), with the user overpaying by 120,528 times, according to Bitcoin explorer Mempool.\n\nThe transaction was mined by AntPool in block 818,087 but it had not publicly commented on the matter until now. The previous record $500,000 fee paid in September was subsequently identified as a \u201cfat finger\u201d overpayment by the crypto services provider Paxos. F2Pool, the miner facilitating that transaction, agreed to reimburse the fee to Paxos.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nHack claim\n\nThe incident was followed by a Bitcoin user claiming to be the victim of the $3 million transaction fee, stating that it was their wallet that paid the fee and that they had been hacked.\n\n\u201cI created a new cold wallet, transferred 139 BTC to it and it got transferred out to another wallet immediately,\u201d the user \u201c83_5BTC\u201d posted on X. \u201cI can only imagine that someone was running a script on that wallet and that the script had a weird fee calculation. 55 BTC gone forever. 83.5 BTC to be decided.\u201d\n\nThe same user had signed a message appearing to demonstrate ownership of the key that made the transaction, verified by Mononaut, the pseudonymous developer behind the Bitcoin explorer Mempool. However, if the wallet was compromised, it could also have been signed by an attacker. This means AntPool would need another method to verify the victim\u2019s identity, Mononaut added. It is unclear whether AntPool intends to do this.\n\nAccording to Mononaut, the likely cause of a hack was the use of a low-entropy wallet, possibly a brainwallet, meaning it was created with insufficient randomness, making it vulnerable to attacks. The transaction was quickly fee-bumped using replace-by-fee (RBF) \u2014 a Bitcoin protocol feature that allows a sender to increase the transaction fee on an unconfirmed transaction, enabling quicker network processing. If it was indeed a low-entropy wallet, multiple attackers could have been competing to steal the funds, Mononaut suggested. This would explain the high fee, with scripts configured to spend a significant portion of the transaction to hinder competitors.\n\nAntPool did not immediately return a request for comment from The Block."

In the speech, Waller mentioned that the easing of the U.S. economy's pace was an encouraging sign, indicating that the current monetary policy aligns with the Fed's 2% inflation goal. \"Data for October indicated an easing in economic activity, and forecasts for the fourth quarter show the kind of moderation that is more in keeping with progress on lowering inflation,\" Waller said in a speech on Tuesday.\n\nHigh probability of a rate pause\n\nWaller added that he is confident current monetary policy is \"well positioned to slow the economy and get inflation back to 2%.\" His comments \u2014 combined with CME FedWatch's 95% probability of a rate pause at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in December \u2014 are fostering optimism among analysts.\n\nThe Fed official was encouraged by the consumer price index inflation reading for October. \"This is what I want to see,\" he said. \"For the month, there was no inflation, prices were virtually flat, and unlike earlier moments where improvements were concentrated in some goods and services, the moderation in inflation was broadly distributed,\" he added.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nHowever, Bitfinex analysts stressed that it is important to note that Waller also cautioned that inflation is still high.

Particular attention will be given to the nuances in Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-announcement press conference and any signals about possible rate cuts in 2024.\n\nBitfinex analysts pointed to signals that indicate the market anticipates the U.S. central bank will commence cutting rates in the spring of 2024. \"The anticipation of such a pause has already influenced bond yields and trader expectations, with rate cuts being priced in starting from May 2024,\" Bitfinex analysts said.\n\n\"We believe part of the current price action and long-term holder positioning for a sustained long-term price increase is part of this effect. This shift in monetary policy, if it occurs, could create a more favorable environment for investment in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies,\" the analysts added."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining consumed 1.6 trillion litres of water worldwide in 2021.\n\nA single Bitcoin transaction could use the same amount of clean water needed to fill a garden swimming pool, according to a new study on the world's most popular cryptocurrency. According to New Scientist, Alex de Vries at the VU Amsterdam School of Business and Economics in the Netherlands calculated that Bitcoin mining, used in part to create new Bitcoins, consumed 1.6 trillion litres of water worldwide in 2021. Broken down per transaction, that means a single Bitcoin trade consumed approximately 16,000 litres of clean water, which is enough to fill a small swimming pool.\n\nNow, experts believe that the use of clean water in Bitcoin mining will rise to 2.3 trillion litres this year. According to the study published in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability, this sheer scale of Bitcoin mining's water consumption could impact drinking water if it continues to operate without regulation, especially in countries that are already battling water scarcity, including the United States. This is \"increasingly hard to defend,\" said Mr Alex.\n\nAccording to the study, mining Bitcoin requires huge computing power to solve mathematical equations on the internet. Water, which is evaporated, is used to cool the computers at large data centres and also to lower the temperature of coal-and-gas-fired power plants that also power Bitcoin mining computers.\n\n\"The mining devices are effectively just generating random numbers all day long, and they just throw them all away and nothing - nothing - useful comes out,\" Mr Alex wrote in the paper. \"It's just one backyard swimming pool going, going up in the air, literally evaporating on average per Bitcoin transaction,\" he added.\n\nAlso Read | Google DeepMind Discovers \"800 Years' Worth Of Knowledge\"\n\nNotably, according to Euronews, the environmental impact of mining Bitcoin has been widely documented, but this is the first assessment of its water use and wider environmental impact. Study authors believe that with the rise in Bitcoin price, its water consumption will also increase to 2,300 gigalitres, which is more than 40% compared to 2021. Mr Alex argued that using renewable energy instead of electricity would not be a solution to reducing Bitcoin's carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, in the study, he also wrote that if Bitcoin changed its technology to be more environmentally friendly, the crypto's environmental damage would reverse overnight. \"If you make the change you cut the majority of everything: the carbon emissions, water footprint, electronic waste, it all goes out the window overnight. Literally, the moment you make the software change, it's all gone,\" Mr Alex said. \"Bitcoin is responsible for half a per cent of global electricity consumption, [and] we could cut this by tomorrow,\" he added."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin today hit $39,000 per coin for the first time since a brutal digital asset crash in May 2022 that brought with it a long and painful bear market.\n\nThe virtual coin has since made a terrific comeback: at the start of January, it was trading for less than $17,000 per coin; it is now up 128%.\n\nCould this mean we\u2019re seeing the beginning of a bull run? Some experts say it\u2019s only up from here.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA lot has happened in the crypto space since blockchain project Terra collapsed last year, leading to a plunge in every virtual coin and token and lots of bankruptcies\u2014most notably, mega exchange FTX.\n\nChased by a toxic mix of industry failures alongside historically high interest rates and it looked like the crypto would never make it back.\n\nBut institutions\u2014including Wall Street giant BlackRock\u2014have since shown big interest in the crypto sphere: the firm and other prestigious names in finance have applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve might just be done with fiscal tightening, which last year caused investors to avoid \u201crisk-on\u201d assets such as equities and crypto.\n\nIn a report Friday, crypto asset manager Grayscale\u2019s research team said that it sees \u201cgradually improving crypto fundamentals\u201d\u2014so long as the central bank \u201chas finished tightening and the U.S. economy can avoid a \u2018hard landing\u2019 (recession).\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGrayscale also mentioned next year\u2019s halving, which will see Bitcoin miner rewards slashed in half and lead to more scarcity in the market\u2014and therefore \u201cshould be positive for valuations.\u201d\n\nAnd James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares, told Decrypt that investors are wanting to branch out\u2014and this could be good for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe increasing correlation between bonds and equities\u2014now at a record high of 42%, excluding the COVID-19 period\u2014is prompting a search for effective diversification among investors,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cBitcoin has proven to offer significantly greater diversification compared to other asset classes.\u201d\n\nAs more investors realize this, the higher the price of the asset will go in the new year, he argued.\n\nMeanwhile, Amberdata\u2019s director of derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt that the data shows that \u201coption traders are very bullish for BTC spot prices and expect prices to move higher relatively soon.\u201d\n\nIf investors do finally get the Bitcoin ETF the SEC has repeatedly rejected for the better part of a decade, capital could flood the market, analysts at CryptoQuant predicted.\n\nAlthough the future may look bright right now, there are other things to consider.\n\n\u201cThere are also headwinds facing Bitcoin\u2019s price,\u201d Sam Callahan from Swan Bitcoin said. \u201cThese include the risk of a recession and the potential denial of a Spot Bitcoin ETF,\u201d he continued, adding that a denial from the SEC could lead to a \u201cshock to the market.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Source: TradingView\n\nPowell: Calling end to hikes would be \u201cpremature\u201d\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed a new 19-month BTC price high of $39,000 on Bitstamp.\n\nBitcoin bulls, already in a strong position, beat out resistance as Fed Chair Jerome Powell took to the stage at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia for a scheduled appearance.\n\n\u201cThe FOMC is strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2% over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we\u2019re confident that inflation is on a path to that objective,\u201d he said in prepared remarks.\n\n\u201cIt would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease.\u201d\n\nWhile keeping his tone cautious, Powell appeared to boost risk asset sentiment with his comments on the current state of the U.S. economy and progress toward reducing inflation.\n\nReacting, financial commentary resource The Kobeissi Letter was among those with a more sober take on what the Fed might do in the future.\n\n\u201cTheir narrative has not changed since last year, but markets continue to call for a Fed pivot,\u201d it wrote in part of a post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n\u201cAs we have stated before, the Fed would rather spark a mild recession than risk a resurgence of inflation. This means that a long PAUSE is still likely.\u201d\n\nBitcoin nonetheless took full advantage of the mood, contrasting with a flat reaction to the week\u2019s earlier U.S. macro data prints.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is due in mid-December, when any changes to interest rates will be announced. Per data from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, as of Dec. 1, market expectations unilaterally favored a pause in hikes.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart.

A daily close above $38K is a powerful signal of a god candle,\u201d fellow popular trader BitQuant forecast earlier on the day.\n\nDaan Crypto Trades added that Bitcoin seemed to be \u201cleaving its previous trading range for the time being,\u201d while Crypto Ed, founder of trading and training group CryptoTA, predicted upside taking Bitcoin to \u201cat least\u201d $39,200 next.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe mystery of a large, unlabelled Bitcoin address has the cryptocurrency space buzzing with questions about who the \u201cwhale\u201d holding over $450 million in Bitcoin might be.\n\nThe \u201cbc1qc\u201d Bitcoin address holds a balance of 12,070 BTC, worth around $455,616,665 at current prices, according to blockchain analytics sites Arkham Intelligence and Blockchair. The address has received tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in the last several weeks, mostly in large batches. But it might not be a whale at all, according to the various experts who spoke with Decrypt.\n\nA \u201cwhale\u201d refers to an investor who hoards large amounts of cryptocurrency. So the idea of a single entity loading up on Bitcoin, at a time when market sentiment is turning bullish, would be an encouraging sign to holders, to say the least.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that Crypto Twitter influencers, such as author and investor Jason Williams and Wealth Mastery founder Lark Davis, are pushing this narrative to their collective millions of followers.\n\nBREAKING \ud83d\udea8 NEWS : A mystery whale keeps up its daily buying streak, acquiring 539 #Bitcoin this morning, following the accumulation of 1,178 #BTC yesterday \ud83d\udc40 Over the past 28 days, they have amassed a total of 10.3K #Bitcoin , propelling them to number 73 on the #BTC rich\u2026 \u2014 Jason A. Williams (@GoingParabolic) November 28, 2023\n\n\u201cA mystery whale keeps up its daily buying streak, acquiring 539 [Bitcoin] this morning, following the accumulation of 1,178 [BTC] yesterday,\u201d Williams tweeted two days ago. \u201cSeems like institutional investors are trying to front-run the spot Bitcoin ETF approval,\u201d Davis followed up today, referring to the rumors that an SEC approval for a long-anticipated Bitcoin ETF is imminent.\n\nA mystery whale has been accumulating large amounts of $BTC recently. Over the last 4 weeks, they have accumulated 10.3K $BTC. Seems like Institutional investors are trying to front-run the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. pic.twitter.com/cTlSMIzSAK \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) November 30, 2023\n\nThe chatter also found its way to Reddit, with a Redditor commenting on a since-removed, but highly upvoted r/Bitcoin post: \u201cMystery new Bitcoin whale buys another 612.5 BTC, acquiring a total of 11,005.82 Bitcoin in just 29 days!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut blockchain analysts are raining on the BTC-pumpin\u2019 parade. It\u2019s much more likely that the wallet belongs to an exchange, moving funds into cold storage (i.e. an offline hardware wallet)\n\n\u201cWe cannot say with 100% certainty but its on-chain behavior suggests that it is most likely part of cold storage infrastructure for an exchange,\u201d a Chainalysis investigator told Decrypt in an email. That\u2019s partly because the address only shows incoming transactions, with none going out.\n\nAmberdata Director of Research Chris Martin concurred.\n\n\u201cIt's not 100% certain that it's an individual or an exchange, but there is a very strong connection with BitMEX,\u201d Martin told Decrypt. \u201cAlmost all of the funding sources were BitMEX hot wallets, but the address doesn't follow their normal address schema (having BMEX, or qmex in the address).\u201d\n\nMartin speculated, though, that the transactions are an exchange consolidating into a single wallet but left open the idea that it may be a whale after all.\n\n\u201cThere's an off-chance it could be a large BitMEX whale leaving the platform,\u201d he said. BitMEX did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nConsolidating wallets is not unusual in the cryptocurrency space. Both individuals and companies can have multiple, sometimes hundreds of addresses and consolidating them into a single address makes the management of digital assets more accessible. Even still, accounts moving large sums of Bitcoin will always draw attention.\n\nIn April, a wallet created in the early days of Bitcoin moved 400 BTC, around $11 million, after being dormant for 12 years. Another wallet moved 279 BTC, around $8 million at the time, that same month. In June, another wallet moved $1.2 million after 13 years of inactivity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo long as blockchains are pseudonymous, and unmarked entities are moving large sums of digital money around, people will continue to speculate about the motives behind the moves."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs Bitcoin ETF decision deadlines loom, there's growing interest in figuring out when, exactly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will make its announcement.\n\nThere's a handful of spot Bitcoin ETF applications pending with the regulator. The SEC missed another window for a decision, choosing instead to extend all of its deadlines. But but there's also been word that the SEC has met with Grayscale and BlackRock in the interim to discuss amendments to their applications.\n\nTo be clear, the SEC could still deny any or all of the pending applications. There's mounting optimism from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong to JP Morgan analysts, but there's no guarantee that the SEC will give any spot Bitcoin ETF the green light in early 2024. Still, experts who have been tracking the applicants' odds say they've never been better, and they have narrowed down a potential approval window to a handful of days in early January.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart says while the window is technically from January 5 through January 10, the securities regulator is unlikely make an announcement on a Friday and even less likely to drop news about the ETF applicants over the weekend.\n\nSo that shrinks the window to Monday, January 8 through Wednesday, January 10. \"Mark your calendars people,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nWindow is officially Jan 5th to Jan 10th. Really this means that any potential approval orders are going to come on either Monday Jan 8, Tuesday Jan 9, or Wednesday Jan 10. Mark your calendars people. https://t.co/8ob8Y6pgU5 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 1, 2023\n\nThe crypto industry has been waiting for a spot Bitcoin ETF to be approved for years.\n\nIn the U.S., regulators have approved Bitcoin futures and even leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs to trade. But a genuine Bitcoin ETF, one that directly tracks BTC and not just derivatives, has so far eluded investors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe idea is this: shares in a Bitcoin ETF would gain and lose value as Bitcoin's price fluctuates, and investments in those shares would allow buyers to gain exposure to BTC without actually buying or holding digital coins.\n\nBecause an ETF makes it easier for traditional investors to jump into crypto, analysts have long predicted that such a product would bring a massive influx of capital into the market. Recently, researchers at blockchain data firm CryptoQuant said they expect an ETF to double Bitcoin's market cap, and potentially increase the overall crypto market by $1 trillion. For context, Apple's market cap sits at a cool $2.9 trillion today.\n\nJust the chance that an ETF might be approved has been incredibly bullish for Bitcoin's price. The world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has found buoyancy thanks to all the attention from institutions and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which limits Bitcoin's inflation rate and could further drive up demand.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDigital asset manager Grayscale continues to say it's just a matter of time before a Bitcoin ETF is finally approved.\n\nThat includes the possibility that the digital asset manager will get approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\u2014currently an open-ended trust available on the OTCQX Market\u2014into a spot Bitcoin ETF. If converted to an ETF, the firm is aiming to have the fund listed on the NYSE Arca exchange.\n\nAnd to that end, the firm asked Craig Salm, its chief legal officer, and Edward McGee, its chief financial officer, to address some common questions about the potential conversion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe believe that regulatory approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is a matter of \u2018when,\u2019 not a matter of \u2018if,'\" Salm wrote in a company blog post today. Once approved, Grayscale \u201cwould immediately work with our partners to uplist GBTC to NYSE Arca,\u201d he added.\n\nBut for every bullish Bitcoin ETF prediction, there's a caveat. Grayscale did not provide an expected timeline for GBTC\u2019s conversion. \u201cTimelines are inherently uncertain,\u201d Salm said.\n\nSome ETF analysts have offered educated guesses about when the SEC might make a decision on pending applications. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said he expects to see some movement from the SEC between Monday, January 8 and Wednesday, January 10.\n\nIn 2022, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC, claiming the Commission had been unfair in refusing to accept an application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Being an ETF would allow the fund to perform simultaneous creations and redemptions of shares to trade in line with Bitcoin's real-time price.\n\nThere's been signs that Grayscale has been making progress. For starters, a judge decided in August that the SEC does need to accept the firm's application. In October, it became clear the SEC wasn't going to file an appeal to the decision and was then ordered to officially review the ETF bid.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo that end, a memo published by the SEC revealed that the SEC met with Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein and McGee last month to discuss \"NYSE Arca, Inc.\u2019s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.\"\n\nEven without being a spot ETF, GBTC already accounts for more than 3% of the total BTC supply. It currently trades at an 8% discount to its net asset value. But as Salm pointed out in the Grayscale blog post, converting to an ETF structure would allow Grayscale to \u201cmore closely track the price of Bitcoin.\"\n\nEdited by Guillermo Jimenez\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset\u2019s price climbs. This has been observed in Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nMacroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates influence risk assets like Bitcoin, mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.\n\nA hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.\n\nToken launches like Arbitrum\u2019s ARB airdrop and Optimism OP influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset\u2019s network.

        "title": "MicroStrategy Boosts Bitcoin Holdings With $590 Million Purchase, Totaling 174,530 BTC - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a testament to its unwavering confidence in Bitcoin (BTC), MicroStrategy, one of the largest Bitcoin holding companies, has once again expanded its cryptocurrency portfolio.\n\nThe company\u2019s former CEO, Michael Saylor, announced the acquisition of an additional 16,130 BTC, valued at approximately $593 million. This strategic move comes as Bitcoin enters a phase of accumulation above the $37,000 mark.\n\nMicroStrategy Adds To Bitcoin Stash\n\nAs announced, MicroStrategy\u2019s latest purchase was made at an average price of $36,700 per Bitcoin. With this acquisition, the company\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at an impressive 174,530 BTC.\n\nThroughout 2023 and previous years, MicroStrategy has consistently demonstrated its commitment to BTC, accumulating a substantial amount of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe total cost of MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin investments exceeds $5.20 billion, with an average purchase price of $30,252 per Bitcoin. This significant investment reflects the company\u2019s long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a store of value and hedge against inflation.\n\nAs reported by NewsBTC, the company has reaped substantial gains from the recent uptrend in the overall cryptocurrency market and Bitcoin\u2019s impressive price surge. With BTC experiencing a 36% increase since October, Microstrategy has now amassed over $1 billion in unrealized profits.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin\u2019s positive performance has directly impacted Microstrategy\u2019s stock, traded under the ticker name MSTR. The stock has witnessed a significant surge in value, closely tied to the ongoing bullish momentum of BTC.\n\nOn November 9, as Bitcoin reached its previous yearly high of $38,000, the price of MSTR stock also soared to an all-time high (ATH) of $533 per share. This milestone further proves Microstrategy\u2019s successful investment strategy over the past three years.\n\nMichael Saylor, a prominent advocate for Bitcoin, has been a vocal proponent of the cryptocurrency, emphasizing its superior qualities compared to traditional fiat currencies.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s continued accumulation of Bitcoin reinforces Saylor\u2019s conviction in its long-term prospects and serves as a testament to the company\u2019s belief in the digital asset\u2019s store-of-value properties.\n\nPotential For Short-Term Pullback Looms\n\nIn a recent market update by the CryptoQuant author IT Tech, short-term insights on the Bitcoin derivatives market shed light on the current upward momentum and the potential for a minor pullback.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the ongoing upward momentum in the Bitcoin market heavily relies on perpetual movement. The rising price of Bitcoin has been a key driving force, contributing to the bullish sentiment.\n\nHowever, the Crypto Volatility Divergence (CVD) Spot indicator suggests a relatively flat movement in spot demand. This indicates that a significant increase in immediate spot demand may not support the current price surge.\n\nIn the absence of strong spot demand materializing in the market, IT Tech suggests a possible minor pullback in the near term.\n\nThis potential pullback could be attributed to several factors, including profit-taking by traders or a lack of sustained buying pressure from spot investors.\n\nThe analysis also highlights the possibility of Bitcoin liquidations in the short term, which could indicate further upward movement to liquidate late short positions.\n\nThis suggests that additional buying pressure may be from those who have taken short positions on Bitcoin. As these shorts are liquidated, it could continue the upward trend.\n\nAs of the latest update, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $37,600, showing a slight decrease of 0.5% over the past 24 hours. However, it has maintained a gain of 1.5% over the past seven days, indicating a period of consolidation for the cryptocurrency\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin briefly touched its 19-month high of $38,000 (roughly Rs. 31 lakh) today. Amid the market volatility, the oldest cryptocurrency clocked a small gain on Thursday, November 30, taking its price to $37,866 (roughly Rs. 31.5 lakh). The month of November proved to be rather lucrative for the crypto market, which saw Bitcoin's price escalate up till its current value point. As per market analysts, Bitcoin's tight trading pattern indicates potential for a bullish continuation for the coming weeks.\n\nEther, for a change, did not follow Bitcoin's price trajectory and found itself on the loss-making side of the crypto price chart. With a loss of 1.08 percent, the value of ETH presently stands at $2,030 (roughly Rs. 1.69 lakh).\n\n\u201cBTC retraced from the $38,000 (roughly Rs. 31 lakh) resistance level following the Wall Street open on November 29, influenced by better-than-expected US gross domestic product (GDP) figures. BTC fluctuated around that level and eventually dropped after the release of US macro data. On the other hand, Ethereum saw a slight decline but held its ground above the 20-day exponential moving average (20 EMA D),\u201d the CoinDCX research team told Gadgets360.\n\nWith Bitcoin and Ether taking different price routes today, the crypto chart has been divided.\n\nAmong profit-making cryptocurrencies, Solana, Dogecoin, Tron, Avalanche, Polygon, and Litecoin marked their presence alongside Bitcoin.\n\nLeo, Stellar, Near Protocol, Iota, and Dash also managed to mint small gains.\n\nMeanwhile, loss-making cryptocurrencies included Tether, Binance Coin, Ripple, Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot alongside Ether.\n\nOther altcoins trading in the reds are Shiba Inu, Bitcoin Cash, Uniswap, Cosmos, Monero, and Cronos.\n\nThe overall crypto market cap slipped minutely by 0.01 percent in the last 24 hours. The sector valuation, as of today, stands at $1.43 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,19,18,735 crore), as per CoinMarketCap.\n\n\u201cThe altcoin in focus today would be dYdX (-1.5 percent) as the DEX token is going to witness it's one of the biggest token unlocks on December 1 with 150 million tokens getting unlocked. While dYdX has been on a slight decline for the past few days, traders are shifting their focus to decentralized exchanges. It could also be a \u2018sell the rumour, buy the news' event,\u201d the CoinSwitch markets desk told Gadgets360.\n\nIn other news, Binance has preponed the ending of its support of the stablecoin BUSD, which it has launched in support with Paxos. Earlier, the company said they would stop supporting BUSD by February 2024. BNB (-0.7 percent) meanwhile, is trading flat on the news.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nIs the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 the best foldable phone you can buy in India right now?
