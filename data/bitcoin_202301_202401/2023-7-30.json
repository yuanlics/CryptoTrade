        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission asked Coinbase to halt trading in all cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin prior to suing the exchange, in a sign of the agency\u2019s intent to assert regulatory authority over a broader slice of the market.\n\nCoinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong told the Financial Times that the SEC made the recommendation before launching legal action against the Nasdaq-listed company last month for failing to register as a broker.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case identified 13 mostly lightly traded cryptocurrencies on Coinbase\u2019s platform as securities, asserting that by offering them to customers the exchange fell under the regulator\u2019s remit.\n\nBut the prior request for Coinbase to delist every one of the more than 200 tokens it offers \u2014 with the exception of flagship token bitcoin \u2014 indicates that the SEC, under chair Gary Gensler, has pushed for wider authority over the crypto industry.\n\n\u201cThey came back to us, and they said . . . we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cAnd, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that\u2019s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we\u2019re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIf Coinbase had agreed, that could have set a precedent that would have left the vast majority of the American crypto businesses operating outside the law unless they registered with the commission.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t have a choice at that point, delisting every asset other than bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US,\u201d he said. \u201cIt kind of made it an easy choice . . . let\u2019s go to court and find out what the court says.\u201d\n\nAccording to Brian Armstrong, if Coinbase had agreed, the vast majority of the American crypto businesses would risk operating outside the law unless they registered with the SEC \u00a9 Reuters\n\nOversight of the crypto industry has hitherto been a grey area, with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission jockeying for control.\n\nThe CFTC sued the largest crypto exchange, Binance, in March of this year, three months before the SEC launched its own legal action against the company.\n\nGensler has previously said he believes most cryptocurrencies with the exception of bitcoin are securities. However, the recommendation to Coinbase signals that the SEC has adopted this interpretation in its attempts to regulate the industry.\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency, which is fundamental to many industry projects, was absent from the regulator\u2019s case against the exchange. It also did not feature in the list of 12 \u201ccrypto asset securities\u201d specified in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance.\n\nThe SEC said its enforcement division did not make formal requests for \u201ccompanies to delist crypto assets\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the course of an investigation, the staff may share its own view as to what conduct may raise questions for the commission under the securities laws,\u201d it added.\n\nStocks, bonds and other traditional financial instruments fall under the SEC\u2019s remit, but US authorities remain locked in debate as to whether all \u2014 or any \u2014 crypto tokens should fall under its purview.\n\nOversight by the SEC would bring far more stringent compliance standards. Crypto exchanges typically also provide custody services, and borrow and lend to customers, a mix of practices that is not possible for SEC-regulated companies.\n\n\u201cThere are a bunch of American companies who have built business models on the assumption that these crypto tokens aren\u2019t securities,\u201d said Charley Cooper, former CFTC chief of staff. \u201cIf they\u2019re told otherwise, many of them will have to stop operations immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see how there could be any public offerings or retail trading of tokens without some sort of intervention from Congress,\u201d said Peter Fox, partner at law firm Scoolidge, Peters, Russotti & Fox.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment on the implications for the rest of the industry of a settlement involving Coinbase delisting every token other than bitcoin."

        "content": "Coinbase\u2019s CEO said a demand from U.S. officials to cease trading all assets except Bitcoin would have spelled the end of the cryptocurrency industry as we know it.\n\nIn an interview published Monday by the Financial Times, Brian Armstrong, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase, revealed the SEC suggested his company make the change while the agency prepared to sue the firm for allegedly operating as an unregistered broker.\n\nHad Coinbase complied with the SEC\u2019s request, it would have delisted every one of the more than 200 tokens it offers, apart from Bitcoin\u2014the world\u2019s most traded cryptocurrency.\n\nThis would have set a precedent that meant most American crypto firms would have been left operating illegally unless they registered with the SEC, according to the FT.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t have a choice at that point. Delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S.,\u201d Armstrong told the publication of Coinbase\u2019s decision to reject the SEC\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cIt kind of made it an easy choice\u2026let\u2019s go to court and find out what the court says.\n\n\u201cThey came back to us, and they said\u2026we believe every asset other than Bitcoin is a security.\n\n\u201cAnd, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that\u2019s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we\u2019re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIt comes following a row over how cryptocurrencies should be classified and as a result, regulated.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has made it clear he believes most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities, but he has conceded that Bitcoin is an exception that ought to be classed as a commodity.\n\nThe classification of the assets determines which regulator\u2014the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)\u2014oversees them.\n\nIn its June lawsuit, the SEC accused Coinbase of failing to register with the agency as a broker, national securities exchange, and clearing agency. It also alleged that some crypto assets offered on Coinbase\u2019s exchange\u2014including popular tokens Solana, Cardano, and Polygon\u2014were unregistered securities.\n\nIt came less than three months after Nasdaq-listed Coinbase revealed it had received a Wells notice\u2014warning that it was facing a legal investigation\u2014from the SEC.\n\nA spokesperson for the SEC was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Fortune.\n\nCrypto troubles\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are notoriously volatile, and being prone to wild swings in value has prompted warnings from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon about their worth as investments.\n\nIn the wake of the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year, regulators have taken steps to crack down on malpractice allegedly being undertaken in the crypto sector, suing Binance and Coinbase in quick succession last month.\n\n\u201cYou simply can\u2019t ignore the rules because you don\u2019t like them or because you\u2019d prefer different ones: The consequences for the investing public are far too great,\u201d Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s division of enforcement, said in a statement as the agency sued Coinbase.\n\nThree months earlier, the CFTC took its own legal action against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, alleging that the company had violated the Commodity Exchange Act and operated an \u201cillegal\u201d exchange and \u201csham\u201d compliance program.\n\nThe legal action weighed on an already suffering crypto industry, with crypto assets across the board still reeling from 2022\u2019s widespread selloff that became known as the Crypto Winter.\n\nLast year\u2019s downturn saw more than $200 billion wiped off the market in a single day back in June, with some experts predicting the phenomenon\u2014which saw many crypto investors\u2019 life savings wiped out overnight\u2014could last through 2023 and possibly into 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, 2022 also brought the spectacular implosion of crypto exchange FTX, leading to speculation late last year over whether the world was witnessing \u201cthe end of crypto,\u201d with some heralding FTX\u2019s collapse as the cryptocurrency market\u2019s \u201cLehman moment.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has recovered somewhat from last year\u2019s lowest point, but at today\u2019s price of just over $29,000 the digital token is still far from its all-time high of nearly $69,000."

Together, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn attorney for both Lichtenstein and Morgan did not respond to a request for comment ahead of Thursday's plea hearing.\n\nOlivier Douliery/Getty Images\n\nThe saga began in August 2016 when the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex was hacked. As Insider previously reported, Lichtenstein and Morgan were not accused of carrying out the hack itself, but as a result of the hack, 119,754 bitcoins were moved into an outside wallet Lichtenstein controlled.\n\nThat bitcoin amounted to $71 million by January 2017, at which point the IRS began tracing thousands of transactions moving through dozens of accounts \u2014 eventually landing in Lichtenstein's and Morgan's personal accounts.\n\nAt the time, the couple said the bitcoin came from investments that predated 2015, but Lichtenstein kept highly detailed notes about the scheme in cloud storage, which authorities eventually gained access to. Among the documents authorities found was a list of 2,000 virtual currency addresses and their private keys, all of which could be traced back to the hack. Authorities also found a spreadsheet with login information for cryptocurrency-exchange accounts, with notes about which accounts were frozen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors also alleged that Lichtenstein and Morgan had been planning to flee to Russia under new identities.\n\nAuthorities found a folder in Lichtenstein's cloud storage labeled \"personas\" with information on how to use the dark web to obtain fake identities. While executing a search warrant on the couple's home, authorities found hollowed-out books, dozens of electronic devices, a bag labeled \"burner phones,\" $40,000 in cash, and foreign currency.\n\nSince their 2022 arrests, Morgan has been on house arrest on a $3 million bond, and court records said she had a new job as a \"growth marketing and business development specialist\" at an undisclosed tech company. Lichtenstein, whom prosecutors have described as a flight risk over his Russian citizenship, has remained incarcerated."

        "title": "\u2018Barbie\u2019 star Margot Robbie on Bitcoin and \u2018big Ken energy\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "The hit movie Barbie has become the summer\u2019s pop culture conversation, so it was probably only a matter of time till the crypto world got drawn in, too. That happened during a recent Fandango interview when the host asked the film\u2019s star, Australian actress Margot Robbie, how to \u201cspot a Ken.\u201d\n\nRobbie responded by recounting a conversation she\u2019d had with the film\u2019s director, Greta Gerwig, during taping when two of the film\u2019s producers\u2014including her husband\u2014would chat about crypto.\n\n\u201cWhen David and Tom would start talking about Bitcoin or something, Greta and I would be like, \u2018You\u2019re being such Kens!\u2019\u201d said Robbie, adding she felt the same when the pair chatted about golf.\n\nKen, of course, is Barbie\u2019s longtime boyfriend who historically has offered little depth or personality, and serves primarily as male eye candy. (The new movie also points to Ken as a symbol of the patriarchy, but a cryptocurrency column is probably not an ideal forum for that particular debate.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Robbie\u2019s comments caught the attention of the crypto crowd. While it\u2019s hard to see her remarks as particularly flattering, the reaction was primarily positive. This included the managing director of investment firm Swan Bitcoin, who tweeted a short excerpt from the pink-hued interview that loops Robbie saying \u201cBitcoin or something\u201d three times.\n\nMeanwhile, as CoinTelegraph notes, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor\u2014whose cybersecurity firm is now one of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin holders\u2014and others hailed Robbie\u2019s subsequent comment: \u201cThere also can be big Ken energy, and that\u2019s a good thing!\u201d\n\nRobbie never clarifies whether that \u201cbig Ken energy\u201d includes men who buy Bitcoin, but many of the cryptocurrency\u2019s social media acolytes were happy to conclude that it does. In the bigger picture, though, it doesn\u2019t really matter. What does matter is that an actor of Robbie\u2019s stature is talking about Bitcoin at all, and that her Hollywood producer husband appears to be dabbling in it. This is free exposure for crypto that would have been unimaginable a decade ago, and so Bitcoin boosters are understandably pleased to get a tiny piece of this summer\u2019s big pop culture moment.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nBinance filed to dismiss the CFTC\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction, writing, \u201cUnited States law governs domestically but does not rule the world.\u201d (Reuters)\n\nHackers used a software vulnerability to steal at least $42 million from several stablecoin pools on the popular DeFi platform Curve Finance.

Upwards of $100 million worth of cryptocurrency are at risk due to a \u201cre-entrancy\u201d bug in Vyper, a programming language used to power parts of the Curve system. Several stablecoin pools on the platform \u2014 used for pricing and liquidity on a number of different DeFi services \u2014 have been drained by hackers so far. Other projects that use the Vyper programming language could share the same vulnerability. As Asia opened its trading day, it was unclear how much had been drained from Curve as a result of the attack. BlockSec, a blockchain auditing firm, estimated the total losses above $42 million in a preliminary analysis posted to Twitter. Curve's CRV token was recently trading at 62 cents, off more than 16% over the past 24 hours. It changed hands as low as 59 cents, a more than 19% decline late Sunday after the breach."

That's after he laughed off bitcoin in 2017 as a measure of demand for money laundering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Novogratz, such a personal change in a major CEO's viewpoint indicates shifting attitudes towards the digital currency.\n\n\"Value comes from when people believe there's value, and now we have this preponderance of evidence,\" he said. \"180 million people around the world, without a gun to their head, take their hard earned savings and store it in this community of people that run this technology, you know, called bitcoin.\"\n\nThis pivoting sentiment could help bitcoin surpass its $69,000 record set in 2021, Novogratz said, further supported by a future cut in interest rates. The token has shifted around the $30,000 mark for the past few months.\n\nSimilarly, Fundstrat said last week that a bitcoin ETF from BlackRock could drive a boost in daily demand for the crypto token, sending the price to $180,000 by April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother upside factor Novogratz noted was Ripple's recent court victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission, when a judge ruled its cryptocurrency was not a security for the general public. To him, this showed that the regulatory rules \"are no where close to clear.\"\n\nHe also touched on the new Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency developed by OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman. The token stands out for its use of an eyeball scanner, used to establish unique digital identities per user.\n\nNoting that it would be a bad idea to bet against Altman right now, Novogratz said of Worldcoin: \"I think the price potentially can go a lot higher, because there's an AI-hype cycle.\"\n\nThe currency was trading at $2.33 as of Monday afternoon."

        "content": "A spot bitcoin exchange traded fund in the U.S. is far from a guaranteed proposition. However, there\u2019s no denying the largest digital currency will see another halving in April 2024. Either or both events could be potential upside catalysts.\n\nThat\u2019s the sentiment of research firm Fundstrat. In a note out earlier this week, Fundstrat forecast that bitcoin could surge to $180,000, roughly six times current prices, ahead of the April 2024 halving. Price appreciation anywhere close to that would likely stir significant upside for shares of bitcoin miners, including those residing on the roster of the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) .\n\nFundstrat also echoed now-familiar sentiment that should the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approve a spot bitcoin ETF, the ensuing reaction would be overtly bullish for bitcoin prices. That could be a positive for SATO\u2019s roster, which is highly correlated to bitcoin price action.\n\n\u201cThis [bitcoin ETF launch] would bring daily demand to $125 million, while daily supply is only $25 million. The implied equilibrium price would need to rise so daily supply matches daily demand. Equilibrium analysis suggests that a clearing price is $140,000 to $180,000, before the April 2024 halvening,\u201d according to Fundstrat.\n\nHalving Alone Could Be Bullish for SATO\n\nWhile the prospects for a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF very much remain up in the air, the halving alone could be a spark for the cryptocurrency and SATO member firms. While halvings cut rewards given to miners, the events aim to keep a lid on supply, which is bullish for bitcoin pricing.\n\nShould the multiplier effect following the halving be in the range of 4x to 5x, that could provide considerable ballast to bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cThis means that $1 of demand can result in a $4 to $5 increase in market cap,\u201d Sean Farrell, Fundstrat\u2019s head of digital asset strategy, noted.\n\nHe put the odds of spot bitcoin ETF approval at 75%, noting that if BlackRock brings the first such fund to market, it\u2019s likely to be one of the biggest ETF launches in industry. Looking further out, Farrell estimated that the spot bitcoin ETF category could eventually eclipse the precious metals ETF space, which currently has approximately $230 billion in combined assets under management.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF or ETFs would stoke demand for bitcoin because issuers would need to purchase the digital currency, in turn driving prices higher. That could benefit SATO.\n\nVettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d) is the index provider for SATO, for which it receives an index licensing fee. However, SATO is not issued, sponsored, endorsed or sold by VettaFi, and VettaFi has no obligation or liability in connection with the issuance, administration, marketing or trading of SATO."

        "content": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong claims that, ahead of its legal action against the company, the SEC requested that the platform delist most crypto tokens, except bitcoin, according to a report from the Financial Times. Yahoo Finance Crypto Reporter David Hollerith breaks down the report.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Well, early this morning we got more color on the clash between the Securities and Exchange Commission and Coinbase before the SEC filed legal action against the major US crypto exchange in June. Here to tell us more, we're joined by our senior reporter David Hollerith. So David, give us some context here.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, Rochelle. So as you mentioned, the SEC sued Coinbase at the beginning of June for allegedly operating an unregistered Securities Exchange. Now in the SEC's lawsuit, they named 13 different cryptocurrencies, including ADA and Sol, which they identified as crypto security assets.\n\nNow according to this story from the Financial Times from earlier this morning, the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that ahead of launching the legal action against the crypto exchange, the SEC had asked Coinbase to delist more than 200 of its crypto tokens. And this essentially is everything but Bitcoin is what Armstrong was highlighting. And that is obviously far different from the 13 or so coins that are named in the lawsuit. And the implication here is pretty clear.\n\nArmstrong has argued in his statement is that if Coinbase had agreed with the SEC and hadn't opposed it and this case hadn't gone to court, it would have essentially set a legal precedent for the crypto industry, which would have stilted it as far as how much it could grow in the US.\n\nSo again, this goes back to the legal murkiness between whether or not a cryptocurrency is a commodity or a security in the US. And there's not a clear law decided. There the SEC believes that most everything, except Bitcoin, in the crypto asset class is a security. And this is obviously now playing out a series of lawsuits in the courts. The most-- I guess the latest stage lawsuit of these we would bring up would be the Ripple case against the SEC.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo it's also interesting that owning Coinbase stock at this point has kind of become like a regulatory bet for investors on the crypto industry having sort of a more positive regulatory outlook in the near future. It's particularly interesting if you look at Coinbase's stock compared to Bitcoin.\n\nSo there's also this ETF situation that's been going on. BlackRock and a number of other asset managers have filed for a Bitcoin ETF, naming Coinbase is a major partner in those offerings. And that, of course, needs to be approved by the SEC. But around the time of the lawsuit and the BlackRock filing, Coinbase's stock has significantly outperformed Bitcoin.\n\nAnd that's interesting because for most of its-- since its inception, for most of its trading history, Coinbase's stock has well underperformed Bitcoin. So we're seeing a huge outperformance over the month of July and we're going to continue to watch that obviously on Thursday when the company reports second quarter earnings. And we'll want to hear more about the regulatory side of things. It is interesting, though, that Coinbase, their financials are important as ever but it does seem like the legal clash right now is really defining how the stock performs."

        "title": "Bitcoin 3.0: Supporting the Energy Future of the Planet - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Sanjay Gupta, Head of Strategy, Auradine Inc.\n\nBitcoin, the first blockchain network and most popular cryptocurrency, has come a long way since its inception in 2009. What started as a niche hobby for cyberpunks and speculators has grown into a global phenomenon with increasing adoption. In order to understand the future trajectory and impact of Bitcoin, it\u2019s important to examine the historical evolution of Bitcoin\u2014 both the technology and asset class\u2014 its breakthroughs and shortcomings, and what is necessary to reach adoption on a global scale.\n\nIn this blog, we will explore the road to \u201cBitcoin 3.0\u201d, what we consider to be the near future state of Bitcoin and its potential to support the energy future of the planet. When implemented and deployed responsibly, Bitcoin mining provides capabilities that can support base energy loads, provide stability to mismatched energy demand and supply characteristics, drive the growth of renewable infrastructure, and enable grid modernization. Breakthroughs in hardware and software optimization are the next step in enabling Bitcoin to scale sustainably and achieve optimal impact worldwide.\n\nSustainable and scalable evolution of Bitcoin 3.0\n\nSource: Auradine\n\nBitcoin 1.0: Early days \u2013 \u201cThe Hobbyist Era\u201d\n\nBitcoin 1.0 refers to the early days of Bitcoin, when it was mainly used by hobbyists and speculators who were fascinated by the allure of Satoshi\u2019s groundbreaking white paper, innovative technology, and its potential to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer, trustless form of money. Bitcoin 1.0 was characterized by trial adoption with primarily speculative use cases. At this time, while the blockchain technology that powered Bitcoin was beginning to be understood as a decentralized, trustless system, it was also exploited for illicit uses that took advantage of its anonymous and global reach as an exchange of value. Bitcoin 1.0 however laid the foundation for the subsequent crypto revolution and proved that it was possible to create a digital currency that operates without intermediaries and central authorities.\n\nBitcoin 2.0: Rapid mining growth \u201cThe Industrialized Mining Era\u201d\n\nBitcoin 2.0 refers to the most recent phase of Bitcoin, where the days of mining in dorm rooms and basements were replaced by a rapid rise of industrial-scale miners and global hashing capacity being measured in Exahash/second (1018 hashes/second!). The Bitcoin security protocol uses a \u2018proof of work\u2019 (PoW) consensus mechanism and requires participants or \u2018miners\u2019 to validate transactions on the block approximately every 10 minutes. Successful miners earn Bitcoin block rewards in addition to any transaction fees.\n\nWhen Bitcoin mining is done at scale, the needed compute speed requires large numbers of specialized ASIC-based computers. These consume significant quantities of energy, which has been an ongoing focus of considerable analysis and debate.\n\nDuring this time, ideas around Bitcoin as a store of value and a legitimate asset gained increasing momentum. For example, Bitcoin was seen as a valuable means for transacting \u2018crisis capital\u2019 in situations of natural or man-made calamities, such as aid at the outset of the Ukraine war. Bitcoin is also experiencing increasing use as an exchange of value in payments for goods and services with initial merchant acceptance enablement.\n\nBitcoin 2.0 attracted the attention and participation of institutional investors, corporations, governments, and regulators, who saw its potential to transform the financial system.\n\nBitcoin 3.0: The Next Phase \u201cResponsible Partner of the Energy and Financial Ecosystem\u201d\n\nBitcoin 3.0 refers to the next evolution of Bitcoin, and, where used properly, can make Bitcoin a responsible partner of the energy and financial ecosystems.\n\nIn addition to the use cases of Bitcoin 2.0 as a store of value, the next era of Bitcoin is poised for increasing use as an exchange of value with widespread merchant acceptance. In the recent past, there has been a rise of NFT-like applications called \u2018ordinals\u2019 where data can be immutably etched onto a micro-building block of Bitcoin called a Satoshi (100 million Satoshis = 1 Bitcoin) and as a currency hedge in countries facing hyperinflation.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin 3.0\u2019s most important use can be as a store for excess and wasted energy that can support the energy future of the planet. Using large quantities of computational power is necessary to support the security aspect of Bitcoin, something that makes it robust compared to other blockchains. But this computational power can be harnessed productively, as the extent of computational power consumed can be deployed to balance the energy grid using rapid demand response, drive sustainable investment in renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions by reducing gas flaring. This is a massive breakthrough. With systems purpose-built to support Bitcoin 3.0, Bitcoin can become a responsible partner to the energy ecosystem and a strong net positive contributor to the planet in the following ways:\n\nDemand response to balance the energy grid: bitcoin mining computations can be rapidly curtailed for energy demand response and grid balancing when needed. ERCOT, Texas electricity grid operator, estimated in a December 2022 report that bitcoin mining operations were able to curtail their operations and relieve roughly 1.7GW of energy during the Texas winter. On the other hand, in times of excess energy supply without corresponding demand, bitcoin mining can be a sink of energy, providing grid stability and economic value. This is especially useful for renewable energy sources like solar and wind which can have highly variable supply. With systems designed for rapid response, unlike most other industries, the bitcoin mining operations can curtail their energy consumption or increase usage in seconds based on the needs of the energy grid. Driving sustainable investment in renewable energy: Clean, renewable energy requires significant capital investment in large-scale projects. Without a clear return on investment, these projects have been limited to a few geographies only often supported by government subsidies. For instance, Africa owns 40% of the globe\u2019s potential for solar power yet it only inhabits less than 2% of the total global capacity for electricity generation of solar energy (IRENA \u201cRenewable Capacity Statistics\u201d, 2021). Bitcoin mining is already being powered by solar and wind energy in different parts of the world. It provides an economically viable option to invest in solar and other renewable energy sources at an industrial scale with systems that are deployable in rugged conditions and remote locations. Reducing harmful gas flaring and using stranded energy: The Global Gas Flaring Research tracker (GGFR), a leading global and independent indicator of gas flaring, estimated that in 2022 gas flaring released 42 million tons in the form of methane. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a potent but short-lived greenhouse gas, with a warming potential much higher than carbon dioxide. Gas flaring is an extraordinary waste of economic value (as much as USD 55 billion per year at a price of USD 10 per MBtu) alongside its negative impacts on climate change and human health. Reducing flaring through Bitcoin mining reduces carbon emissions while capturing the economic value, without any additional energy consumption.\n\nBitcoin 3.0 is not a distant dream or a utopian vision for an idealistic technology. It is already happening in various forms across the world. For this to succeed further, Bitcoin mining silicon, software and system solutions need to be designed from the ground up for rapid energy demand response and be deployable in remote locations and harsh conditions at scale.\n\nAs Bitcoin 3.0 evolves, it will become more integrated and aligned with the energy and financial ecosystems, creating a more efficient, inclusive, and sustainable world.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The hack has been linked to a flaw in a programming language. These concerns increased as reports surfaced on Tuesday of an attack on the LeetSwap exchange running on Coinbase. Solana and Matic led the top 10 losers mid Tuesday. Litecoin also gave up gains ahead of its halving event on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin, Ether hold steady\n\nBitcoin fell 1.8% in the last 24 hours to US$28,872 as of 12:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell under the US$30,000 support floor in the latter weeks of July and has fluctuated around US$29,000 since then, unable to find buying support for a breakout in the so-called summer doldrums when trading in many capital markets slows.\n\nHowever, drama came over the weekend when decentralized stablecoin exchange Curve Finance reported a security issue in older versions of Vyper, the programming language used for smart contracts.\n\nAccording to data from smart contract auditing firm BlockSec, hackers drained an estimated US$41 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform as a result of the malfunction, raising concerns about possible problems at other DeFi platforms.\n\nCurve Finance is the third largest decentralized financial exchange (DEX) by 7-day trading volume, according to DeFi data tracker DefiLlama.\n\nBitcoin and Ether lost ground as CoinDesk reported that LeetSwap said its working with on-chain security experts to recover 340 Ether after PeckShield tweeted the exchange on Coinbase\u2019s Layer 2 blockchain had been attacked.\n\nIn earlier comments related to the Curve hack, Justin d\u2019Anethan at Hong Kong-based crypto market maker Keyrock said Bitcoin had held up well considering.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIndeed, after the Vyper hacks that affected a number of pools in Curve and pushed prices of CRV, CVX and FXS along with other yield protocols down, BTC and ETH held steady,\u201d he said before reports of the LeetSwap exploit.\n\nLackluster trading and caution is seen elsewhere in crypto asset investment products, which saw minor outflows of US$21 million last week, 93% of which were from long-Bitcoin investment products, according to an emailed report from European alternative asset manager CoinShares.\n\n\u201cThis suggests investors have been taking profits in recent weeks, with the sentiment for the asset overall remaining supportive,\u201d the CoinShares report said.\n\nNigel Green, the CEO and founder of the deVere investment advisory group, said summer typically ushers in reduced market activity, which in turn can create price inefficiencies and increased volatility.\n\n\u201cWhen used effectively and efficiently, volatility can be an extremely powerful investment tool as you can enhance your portfolios with high quality assets at lower entry points,\u201d Green said in email comments.\n\n\u201cNot only does Bitcoin remain one of the best performing asset classes of the decade, I believe its performance will further strengthen. Both institutional and retail investors are increasingly seeing the value of a digital, global, borderless and tamper-proof currency and store of value.\n\n\u201cThis trend will increase as adoption picks up further and as confidence grows again in the global economy.\u201d\n\nEther, the second largest crypto token by market cap, fell 2.10% to US$1,825 early Tuesday afternoon after trading flat in the morning.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell Tuesday morning. Solana led the losers, dipping 4.6% to US$23.31, while Matic was close behind with a drop of 4.1% to US$0.67.\n\nLitecoin fell 3.5% to US$89.83, barely holding a gain of 1% for the last week ahead of its halving event on Wednesday.\n\nThe halving is expected to cut the mining reward for each successfully minted Litecoin block from 12.50 LTC to 6.25 LTC, increasing its scarcity and potentially triggering a rise in the token\u2019s price. Litecoin is up about 31% year to date.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 1.8% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while trading volume rose 17.6% to US$30.83 billion.\n\nNFT 500 ends July in red\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.19% in the past 24 hours to 2,516.20 as of 7:45 a.m. in Hong Kong, resulting in a drop of 5.37% for the week and 10.70% for the month.\n\nForkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Cardano NFT market indexes all logged losses, while the index measuring the performance of Polygon\u2019s NFT market edged up a slight 0.18%.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 2.93% in the past 24 hours to US$17.65 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volume on Ethereum, the largest NFT network, declined 10.17% to US$11.68 million.\n\nTrading volumes on Polygon jumped 87.67% to US$1.14 million to take second spot in Cryptoslam\u2019s rankings. Solana and BNB networks also saw increases in NFT volumes.\n\nNFT trading volume on the Bitcoin network dropped 20.08% to US$479,775. \u201cAn ecosystem that many, myself included, had predicted to one day flip Ethereum is showing its limitations,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cWith no avenues right now for utility, traders are finding few reasons to collect these assets that promise nothing more than small jpegs to collect. We\u2019ll need to see some innovation or more premium art on Bitcoin if we want to see its ecosystem turn around.\u201d\n\nBy NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) saw the largest 24-hour trading volume, gaining 26.26% to US$1.12 million. DMarket and Gods Unchained Cards, which are both in-game NFT items, ranked second and third.\n\nU.S. equities finish July strong\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures gained as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. stock indexes ended July with strong gains of between 3% to 4%.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes rose on Tuesday morning, with the exception of China\u2019s Shanghai Composite after manufacturing data missed expectations. Private research firm Caixin Insight Group\u2019s China General Manufacturing PMI for July released Tuesday dropped for the first time since April, missing market estimates and hitting its lowest point in six months.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economic recovery in the first quarter exceeded expectations, but the momentum weakened in the second,\u201d wrote Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin. \u201cAlthough the data for industrial production and investment in June showed some signs of recovery, macroeconomic growth remained sluggish, and considerable downward pressure on the economy persisted.\u201d\n\nZhe added: \u201cguaranteeing employment, stabilizing expectations and increasing household income\u201d should remain the top priorities of Chinese policymakers.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained as the country\u2019s unemployment rate edged lower in June as forecasted, marking the country\u2019s lowest jobless rate since January.\n\nIn the U.S., second quarter earnings season continues with reports from Apple, Amazon, Pfizer and others through the week, plus more economic indicators. The S&P Global\u2019s U.S. manufacturing purchasing manager\u2019s index (PMI) will be out Tuesday and the July employment report on Friday.\n\nOn interest rates, the Federal Reserve next meets on Sept. 19 and 20 after raising a quarter of a point in July. Rates are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest since January 2001.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell last week reiterated the bank takes a data-driven approach to decide interest rate policy and Fed economists said the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. has diminished, indicating to some analysts the Fed may leave rates unchanged next month.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 82.5% chance the Fed will keep rates as is in September, and a 17.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\n(Updates with equity section)"

        "title": "Crypto community reacts to Barbie star saying Bitcoin talk exudes Ken energy - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Australian actress Margot Robbie, who plays the lead role in the new Barbie movie, has caused a stir within the crypto community after stating that talking about Bitcoin (BTC) reflects similar traits to Barbie\u2019s companion, Ken.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the crypto community on X (Twitter), including MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor and social media influencer Layah Heilpern, had a mixed response to Robbie\u2019s statement about Bitcoin in an interview with Fandango on June 22.\n\nRobbie revealed that every time she overheard her husband, Tom Ackerley, and television producer, David Heyman, discussing Bitcoin on set, it brought to mind the traits of Ken, the fictional co-star character in Barbie, played by Ryan Gosling.\n\n\u201cWhen David and Tom would start talking about Bitcoin or something, Gretta and I would be like, you\u2019re being such Kens!\u201d\n\nAlong with Saylor declaring that Bitcoin is, in fact, \u201cBig Ken Energy,\u201d several other prominent figures in the crypto industry shared their thoughts on Robbie\u2019s comments.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin spending copies history as metric flags \u20181st stage bull market\u2019\n\nCrypto influencer Lea Thompson, better known to her 225,000 Twitter followers as Girl Gone Crypto, stated that she is \u201cso bullish\u201d after hearing Robbie talk about Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoiners last week: yah haven't seen the Barbie movie, whatever, looks dumb\n\n\n\nBitcoiners today: MARGOT ROBBIE SAID THAT BITCOIN IS BIG KEN ENERGY, SO BULLISH \u2014 Girl Gone Crypto (@girlgone_crypto) July 29, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, Layah Heilpern perceived Robbie\u2019s remarks differently, suggesting that she interpreted it as an insult toward men who talk about Bitcoin.\n\nOn July 30, Heilpern explained to her 621,400 Twitter followers that Robbie implied male Bitcoin enthusiasts are \u201cweak and pathetic.\u201d\n\nWhen Margot Robbie said you\u2019re a Ken if talk #bitcoin\n\n\n\nShe meant you\u2019re weak and pathetic. This was not a good thing \u2014 Layah Heilpern (@LayahHeilpern) July 29, 2023\n\nHowever, Mark Travers, lead psychologist at Awake Therapy, suggested that having Ken\u2019s energy could be a sign of someone who is selfless and can adapt to different situations.\n\nTravers stated in a July 13 Forbes report that the character of Ken challenges traditional gender stereotypes.\n\n\u201cIn a universe which revolves around Barbie, Ken has only a supportive role to play, and he plays it gladly,\u201d Travers stated, adding:\n\n\u201cBarbie is and comes before everything, we see male counterpart Ken relegated to the uni-dimensional and purely aesthetic role that women have often been confined to in the past, in a flippant and parody-like manner.\u201d\n\nRobbie stated in the interview that it is hard to define what makes a Ken or what gives off Ken energy, as it can be subjective.\n\n\u201cIt is not something you can define; it is just something you can sense,\u201d Robbie stated.\n\nWith a sense of optimism, Steven Lubka, a managing director at Swan Bitcoin, perceived Robbie\u2019s comment as a positive for the crypto community.\n\nLubka told his 20,200 Twitter followers on July 29 that \u201cwe are so back.\u201c\n\nBarbie said we are all Ken's\n\n\n\nWe are so back \u2014 Steven Lubka (@DzambhalaHODL) July 29, 2023\n\nRobbie\u2019s comments on Bitcoin were brief and neutral, taking place as there are ongoing legal actions against celebrities who have recently promoted crypto.\n\nMost recently, NBA Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler sought to be removed from a $1 billion class-action lawsuit alleging the promotion of unregistered securities by cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\n\nIn a July 24 filing, Butler\u2019s lawyers argued that the tweets he appeared in did not promote the named securities, and, therefore, could not have helped promote them.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, as well as YouTubers Ben Armstrong (BitBoy Crypto) and Graham Stephan, are also challenging similar allegations in the same lawsuit.\n\nMagazine: Crypto winter can take a toll on hodlers\u2019 mental health"

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the US Securities and Exchange Commission took Coinbase to court, the regulator asked the crypto-exchange platform to delist all tokens but bitcoin, CEO Brian Armstrong disclosed to the Financial Times.\n\nIf Coinbase followed through, the recommendation would have halted the trading of over 200 crypto assets. The SEC argued that, aside from bitcoin, each of the cryptocurrencies was an unregistered security.\n\n\"We said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that's not our interpretation of the law,\" Armstrong told the FT. \"And they said, we're not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than bitcoin.\"\n\nAccording to him, delisting virtually all its tokens would have led to the end of the US crypto industry, making the choice of what to do easy, he said: \"Let's go to court and find out what the court says.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Coinbase's failure to comply, the SEC sued the platform in early June, accusing it of not registering as an exchange and listing 13 traded cryptocurrencies the regulator deemed as unregistered securities.\n\nA day prior, it also sued crypto competitor Binance, also citing the unauthorized sale of securities.\n\n\"SEC staff does not ask companies to delist crypto assets,\" a spokesperson told Insider. \"In the course of an investigation, the staff may share its own view as to what conduct may raise questions for the Commission under the securities laws.\"\n\nA Coinbase spokesperson said the SEC didn't request that Coinbase delist specific assets, adding that such a request requires a majority vote from the commissioners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Per the SEC's own assertion, the views shared in the FT article may have represented the views of some staff at the time, but did not represent those of the Commission more broadly,\" the spokesperson said. \"We continue our discussions with the Commission, but believe that transparent and fair rulemaking and Congressional action, such as bills that we saw gain bipartisan support in the US House of Representatives last week, represent the best path forward for American crypto users and the companies building the cryptoeconomy in the US.\"\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler has warned recently that the crypto world is full of \"fraud\" and \"hucksters.\" Speaking with Bloomberg TV last week, he said that \"investors should be aware that it's not only a highly speculative asset class, it's also one that they currently should not assume that they're getting the protections of the securities laws \u2013 even though those securities laws apply to many of those tokens.\"\n\nBut in mid-July, the ongoing debate about the nature of crypto assets took a turn against the regulator, when the SEC lost its lawsuit against Ripple's XRP token. Having sued the company in 2020 for failing to register the currency, a US judge said XRP is not a security when sold to the general public but is a security when sold to institutional investors.\n\nAfterwards, shares in XRP skyrocketed 61%, while Coinbase stock rose over 10%."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly requested Coinbase to stop trading in all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin (BTC) before suing America\u2019s largest crypto exchange last month, according to a report by the Financial Times citing CEO Brian Armstrong.\n\n\u201cThey came back to us, and they said [. . .] we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security,\u201d said Coinbase CEO. \u201cAnd, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that\u2019s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we\u2019re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nA Coinbase spokesperson told Decrypt that the interview \"omitted critical context regarding [Coinbase's] conversations with the SEC in the US,\" adding that \"per the SEC\u2019s own admission, the views shared in the FT article may have represented the views of some staff at the time, but did not represent those of the Commission more broadly.\"\n\nThe SEC didn't immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nIn a June lawsuit, the SEC accused Coinbase of operating illegally because it failed to register as an exchange. The regulator also alleged the exchange\u2019s staking service offered at least 13 crypto assets that should have been registered as securities, including tokens such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and The Sandbox (SAND).\n\nIn a separate move, the SEC also sued Binance in June for offering unregistered securities and allowing U.S. investors to access its global website Binance.com. The Wall Street regulator also alleged that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and the crypto exchange misused and commingled customers' funds.\n\nAccording to Armstrong, had Coinbase agreed to the request, it would have set a precedent and may have led to the regulator cracking down on the majority of American crypto businesses operating under similar conditions.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t have a choice at that point, delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US,\u201d said Armstrong. \u201cIt kind of made it an easy choice [. . .] let\u2019s go to court and find out what the court says.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe regulator reportedly said its enforcement division did not make formal requests for \u201ccompanies to delist crypto assets.\u201d\n\nThe Coinbase representative added that the crypto exchange is still in discussions with the SEC and believes \"that transparent and fair rulemaking and Congressional action, such as bills that we saw gain bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives last week, represent the best path forward for American crypto users and the companies building the cryptoeconomy in the U.S.\u201d\n\nGensler on Bitcoin\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously suggested that all cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin are securities.\n\nHe\u2019s also often been citing the lack of investor protection as a reason for enforcement actions against crypto companies, comparing the sector to \u201cthe Wild West.\u201d\n\nSEC Chair Gensler Again Says Bitcoin Is Not a Security. What About Ethereum?\n\nIn the June lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC, however, didn\u2019t mention Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, among those tokens it asserted to be securities.\n\nOn June 28, the San Francisco-based company filed a motion to dismiss the SEC\u2019s lawsuit, arguing that the agency does not have statutory authority over the exchange and that its position regarding its powers is \u201cuntenable as a matter of law.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated on July 31, 2023 at 6 am Eastern Standard Time to include comment from Coinbase."

        "title": "Bitcoin investment for doctors: risks, rewards, and the necessity of diversification - Kevin MD",
        "content": "8 Shares Share\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly digitized and economic realities continually shift, there has been a growing conversation among medical professionals regarding investing, particularly in digital assets like Bitcoin. The appeal of Bitcoin is substantial, especially in an era marked by high inflation rates. Bitcoin is the first \u201cprogrammed\u201d money that relies on math and code. It has an open public and simple code and has never been hacked. This is because it lives simultaneously on millions of computers at the same time. To hack it, one would need all the computing power in the world. Traditional finance players such as BlackRock (575-1 for ETF approval record) and Fidelity have recently applied for ETFs, and institutional money is poised to rush into the digital asset sector, which should have a positive impact on the Bitcoin price. There are trillions of dollars in pension funds and mutual funds, and now they will have the regulatory approval to finally dip their toes in the water on Bitcoin and other digital assets. This is all happening at a time when the number of Bitcoins made per day gets cut in half! This piece aims to shed light on the potential risks and benefits of Bitcoin investment for physicians and to highlight its necessary place in any robust portfolio. First, let\u2019s discuss the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, due to occur in 10 months, and what this signifies for investors.\n\nThe essence of the Bitcoin halving event is to reduce the number of new Bitcoins generated and awarded to miners. Approximately every four years, the reward for mining Bitcoin is halved, which inevitably creates a scarcity of new coins entering circulation. Today, 900 bitcoins are created daily; however, after the next halving event, only 450 will be mined per day. This reduction could potentially increase the value of Bitcoin due to its decreased supply and increased demand. Looking at the long-term Bitcoin chart, we can see the cyclical nature of this \u201csupply-shock\u201d programmed halving event.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is historically volatile, and its value can fluctuate rapidly. This volatility, although daunting, does not negate Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a robust hedge against inflation and as an appreciating asset. Physicians, who generally have a stable income, might benefit from the addition of Bitcoin to their investment portfolios, as its potential for high returns could offer a useful counterbalance to more traditional, lower-yield investments.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin also presents an opportunity to participate in the new economic realities that cryptocurrencies are shaping. While these digital assets can be risky, they offer an exciting frontier for those willing to navigate their sometimes turbulent waters. As we approach the end of a bear market and gear up for the next four-year cycle, the stage is set for those with the foresight and courage to seize this opportunity.\n\nMy personal strategy has been to allocate a small (roughly 5 percent) portion of my portfolio to digital assets. This allocation should not dominate your portfolio but instead supplement more traditional investments. Ninety percent of my digital asset allocation is in Bitcoin, and I auto-dollar cost average (\u201cDCA\u201d) every day with the River financial app. I recommend leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s position as the primary and most well-known cryptocurrency. The remaining 10 percent is allocated to more speculative projects such as Verasity (VRA), Blockchain Bets (BCB), Blocksquare Token (BST), TriasLab (TRIAS), and Realio Network (RIO), amongst many others. While these assets carry a higher risk due to their speculative nature, they also provide \u201clotto ticket\u201d potential for high returns. These \u201casymmetric bets\u201d should be expected to go to zero, but it\u2019s worth reading up on them to learn more about the space, and I have experienced a small bet that went over 100x, and it\u2019s a thrilling feeling for sure if it happens!\n\nSelf-custody is a critical factor to consider when investing in digital assets. Storing your own cryptocurrencies gives you total control over your assets. For Bitcoin, I recommend the Muun and Green wallets, which have excellent security features and user-friendly interfaces. For altcoins, consider using MetaMask, Uniswap, and download the rapidly growing ethos.io app for news and other market tools.\n\nAs with all investments, it is crucial to do your own research, understand the risks involved, and perhaps seek advice from a digital asset-specific financial advisor. Remember, Bitcoin investment, like any investment, should be approached responsibly and as part of a diversified strategy. Debt is growing faster than ever, and because of this fact, it is more important to be diversified into non-dollar-denominated assets as well. Bitcoin can act as a hedge against future inflation spikes.\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin and other digital currencies carry a certain degree of risk, they offer exciting possibilities for high returns and should be considered a necessary addition to any physician\u2019s investment portfolio. As we stand on the brink of a new Bitcoin cycle and the halving event, it\u2019s a thrilling time to explore the world of digital asset investing. Here\u2019s to harnessing the potentials of this nascent digital asset class and shaping our financial futures with savvy and strategic investment choices. Good luck to us all, and let\u2019s look forward to the upcoming cycle with optimism and excitement!\n\nNoah Kaufman is an emergency physician and financial planner."

        "content": "Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz shared what an ideal investment portfolio would look like for a young and high-risk tolerance investor during an interview with Bloomberg Wealth, saying that he\u2019d invest in the Chinese giant Alibaba, silver, gold, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethe(ETH).\n\n\u201cIf they were young and had a high-risk tolerance, I\u2019d be buying Alibaba stock. I\u2019d be buying silver, gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum. That\u2019d be my portfolio,\u201d he said in allusion to someone investing $100,000. For those with lower risk tolerance, he recommended allocating only 30% of a portfolio in the example, with the remaining 70% in bonds and perhaps index funds.\n\nNovogratz\u2019s bullish stance on Bitcoin received a boost from BlackRock's application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June. In his opinion, the application was the biggest Bitcoin development of 2023.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink.\u201d\n\nRelated: Grayscale urges SEC to approve all Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously\n\nFink, the billionaire CEO of BlackRock, was initially a \u201cnonbeliever,\u201d Novogratz said.\n\n\u201cNow he says, \u2018Hey, this is going to be a global currency.

Ron DeSantis has pushed a platform based partly on \u201ceconomic independence\u201d in his 2024 presidential campaign, specifically taking a stance on digital currencies.\n\nSpeaking at a campaign event in New Hampshire on July 31, DeSantis reiterated his plans of banning central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, should he win the Republican nomination and presidential race and take office in 2025. The Florida governor added he planned to end U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cwar on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency\u201d should he win the presidency.\n\nRon DeSantis speaking at a campaign event in New Hampshire on July 31. Source: YouTube\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to which specific policies DeSantis was referring, but he suggested they were coming through the Federal Reserve. President Biden signed an executive order establishing plans for a regulatory framework for digital currencies in March 2022. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also filed several lawsuits against crypto firms while Biden has been in office, and the Department of Justice has overseen criminal charges for former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky.\n\nDeSantis went on to compare the United States government\u2019s plans for a CBDC to those in China, where the central bank is currently conducting trials of a digital yuan. He claimed that \u201cunaccountable elites\u201d in the government could not be trusted to handle the potential rollout of a digital dollar.\n\n\u201c[The Fed wants] to go to a cashless society. They want to eliminate cryptocurrency,\u201d claimed DeSantis. \u201cAs president, on day one, CBDC goes into the trash can \u2014 we\u2019re not going to allow it.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire is widely considered a suitable testing ground for U.S. presidential candidates due to the state holding the first primary in the national race. DeSantis has had a rocky start to his official campaign since announcing it on Twitter \u2014 now X \u2014 in May but is still considered the second most viable Republican candidate, according to several different polls.\n\nRelated: Rep. Patrick McHenry blames White House for lack of urgency on stablecoin bill negotiations\n\nNearly all polls show DeSantis trailing well behind twice-impeached former president and federally indicted candidate Donald Trump.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democratic party candidate polling roughly 40-50 points behind Biden, has made several pro-crypto statements in his campaign and revealed several BTC purchases.

Despite a difficult July, the BTC price is still up 78.88% in 2023.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks performance. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nThe decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price reduced the profitability of miners. To make conditions more challenging for miners, the mining difficulty reached a new all-time high, reducing miner profitability.\n\nHistorical trends show that the network\u2019s hash rate could continue to rise leading up to the halving on April 26, 2024 as miners increase their hashing power by installing new efficient machines.\n\nBesides adding to their processing power, miners are also adopting other hedging techniques like selling Bitcoin futures to lock in current prices.\n\nAs the network\u2019s hash rate is expected to increase through the year as miners reinvest in new machines and adopt other hedging techniques, miner profitability and stock valuations will continue to face pressure in the lead-up to the event.\n\nBitcoin hash rate projected to grow until halving\n\nWhile the BTC price has increased by around 80% year-to-date, the mining difficulty has also increased by 51%, offsetting the rise in profitability from the price surge.\n\nIn mid-July, Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty set a new all-time high of 53.91 trillion units.

However, with less than nine months, or three quarters, before the next halving, the trend hasn\u2019t repeated yet.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Bitcoin roars back after a year of crypto industry scandals and losses, Mike Novogratz says one man in particular gives him reason to stay bullish.\u201cThe most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink,\u201d Novogratz said, referring to the investment titan who is chief executive officer at BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s biggest asset manager.BlackRock thrilled the crypto community in June when it applied to launch an exchange-traded fund to track the spot price of Bitcoin \u2014 a move that, if approved, could potentially spark a new wave of investment in the cryptocurrency. But it was Fink\u2019s seeming conversion from crypto skeptic to Bitcoin believer \u2014 he now considers it an \u201cinternational asset\u201d \u2014 that really has Novogratz excited.\u201cHe got \u2018orange-pilled,\u2019 as we say. Orange pill is when you take a nonbeliever and you make them a believer in Bitcoin,\u201d Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, told David Rubenstein in an interview this week for an upcoming episode of Bloomberg Wealth. \u201cLarry was a nonbeliever. Now he says, \u2018Hey, this is going to be a global currency.\u2019 People around the world all trust it.\u201dBlackRock\u2019s ETF push and Fink\u2019s evolving attitude are part of an \u201cadoption cycle\u201d that Novogratz said may help the coin top its all-time high of nearly $69,000 reached in 2021 \u2014 especially when it\u2019s accompanied by an eventual Federal Reserve pivot toward cutting rates. This week, Bitcoin hovered between $29,000 and $30,000 after soaring more than 70% year to date.Novogratz, in a wide-ranging conversation at Galaxy\u2019s offices in lower Manhattan, also said a recent ruling in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s case against Ripple Labs represented a \u201chuge victory\u201d for crypto, and touched on topics ranging from Sam Altman\u2019s eyeball-scanning Worldcoin project to Galaxy\u2019s commitment to keeping a presence in New York.One of the most vocal crypto advocates from Wall Street, Novogratz, a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Fortress Investment Group, first bought Bitcoin when it was trading at about $100. In 2018, he founded Galaxy Digital, which provides financial services such as trading, investment banking and asset management in the crypto industry.Novogratz\u2019s reputation took a hit last year when a crypto project he supported, the Luna token invented by South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon as part of an experiment in algorithmic stablecoins, blew up, triggering a series of collapses in the industry. The now-infamous tattoo on his arm \u2014 a wolf howling at the moon with the word \u201cLuna\u201d \u2014 serves as a \u201cgood reminder of hubris,\u201d Novogratz said.His advice today, for someone who has $100,000 to invest: \u201cIf they were young and had a high risk tolerance, I\u2019d be buying Alibaba stock. I\u2019d be buying silver, gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum. That\u2019d be my portfolio.\u201d Those with lower risk tolerance should put 30% in a portfolio like that and 70% in bonds and perhaps an index fund, he said.Asked if Worldcoin would take off, Novogratz said \u201cyou don\u2019t want to bet against Sam Altman right now.\u201d (Altman, co-founder of Worldcoin, is also behind the artificial intelligence sensation ChatGPT.) Worldcoin uses a small device called an \u201corb\u201d to scan people\u2019s eyeballs in order to generate a a unique digital identity for online use. A token issued by the project more than doubled in value at launch this week, before retreating from those highs. It traded at $2.20 as of 6:30 p.m. on Friday in New York.\u201cI think the price potentially can go a lot higher, because there\u2019s an AI hype cycle,\u201d Novogratz said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will all use that as our identity.\u201dThis year, a flurry of enforcement actions by the SEC against the biggest crypto firms has rattled many in the industry. Novogratz said the recent court ruling in the SEC\u2019s suit against Ripple \u2014 the judge declared that Ripple\u2019s XRP token was a security in some instances but not in others \u2014 delivered a victory to the crypto industry because it proves that \u201cthe rules are nothing close to clear.\u201dAs for Galaxy itself, even as it moves parts of its business offshore, it remains committed to New York. \u201cI don\u2019t see us not being in the US or being in New York,\u201d Novogratz said.To see the full interview with Novogratz, watch Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein on Tuesday Aug. 8 at 9 p.m. NY time on Bloomberg Television."

        "content": "The hit movie Barbie has become the summer's pop culture conversation, so it was probably only a matter of time till the crypto world got drawn in too. That happened during a recent Fandango Bitcoin or something, Gretta and I would be like, you\u2019re being such Kens!\" said Robbie, adding she felt the same when the pair chatted about golf.\n\nKen, of course, is Barbie's longtime boyfriend who historically has offered little depth or personality, and serves primarily as male eye candy. (The new movie also points to Ken as a symbol of the patriarchy, but a cryptocurrency column is probably not an ideal forum for that particular debate.)\n\nIt wasn't long before Robbie's comments caught the attention of the crypto crowd. While it's hard to see her remarks as particularly flattering, the reaction was primarily positive. This included the managing director of investment firm Swan Bitcoin, who tweeted a short excerpt from the pink-hued interview that loops Robbie saying \"Bitcoin or something\" three times.\n\nMeanwhile, as CoinTelegraph notes, Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor\u2014whose cybersecurity firm is now one of the world's largest Bitcoin holders\u2014and others hailed Robbie's subsequent comment that, \"There also can be big Ken energy and that's a good thing!\"\n\nRobbie never clarifies whether that \"big Ken energy\" includes men who buy Bitcoin, but many of the cryptocurrency's social media acolytes were happy to conclude that it does. In the bigger picture, though, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that an actor of Robbie's stature is talking about Bitcoin at all, and that her Hollywood producer husband appears to be dabbling in it. This is free exposure for crypto that would have been unimaginable a decade ago, and so Bitcoin boosters are understandably pleased to get a tiny piece of this summer's big pop culture moment.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) heads into a new week, with a new monthly close still stuck in one of its narrowest-ever ranges.\n\nActing in an area just below $30,000, BTC price performance has frustrated or simply bored traders over the past week \u2014 could a breakout come next?\n\nThis is the question on every market participant\u2019s mind as the week begins with the July monthly close and the chance for associated volatility.\n\nWhile some believe that Bitcoin is, in fact, overdue for a comedown, data suggests that buying pressure is returning at current levels. Add to that a potential long-term bull flag due to confirm on the monthly close, and all might not be so bad for Bitcoin bulls.\n\nAs a quiet macro week shifts the focus to other potential price triggers for crypto, Cointelegraph takes a look at the major topics for moving markets in the coming days and beyond.\n\nSticky BTC price range could shift after July monthly close\n\nBitcoin was infamously stable last week, with not even the United States interest rate hike and accompanying macroeconomic data managing to shift its tiny trading range.\n\nBTC price observers have had to console themselves with a corridor between $29,000 and $29,500 \u2014 one which is still in force at the time of writing, as per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhile the weekly close did offer some snap moves up and down, a short-term trend remains conspicuously lacking.\n\nOn the radar next is the monthly close, which is currently due to see BTC/USD lock in monthly losses of 3.5%.\n\n\u201cThe market is going to try to shake you out as we move to and thru the Monthly close,\u201d monitoring resource Material Indicators wrote in part of its latest commentary.\n\nAn accompanying chart of the BTC/USD order book on the largest global crypto exchange Binance showed the current trading range clearly defined with bid and ask liquidity.\n\nBTC/USD order book data on Binance. Source: Material Indicators/Twitter\n\nOn the topic of liquidity, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades delineated the significant levels to watch on low timeframes.\n\n\u201cThe ~29K and ~29.6K levels correspond nicely with out current low timeframe range so good to keep watching those regions,\u201d he told Twitter followers prior to the weekly close alongside data from CoinGlass.\n\nCoinGlass likewise showed that, historically, July had been a \u201cgreen\u201d month for Bitcoin for the past six years, with the exception of 6.6% losses in 2019.\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns chart (screenshot).

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFlorida governor and presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis says he would call off the Biden administration\u2019s alleged attack against the crypto industry on his first day in office if elected as commander in chief.\n\n\u201cBiden's war on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency will come to an end when I become president,\u201d said DeSantis during a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Monday.\n\nThe Republican, who has previously expressed support for the right to use Bitcoin, reiterated his impartial attitude toward the technology, while again blasting the current administration\u2019s consideration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). \u201cAs President, on day one, CBDC goes into the trash can\u2014we\u2019re not going to allow it,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnlike private-market cryptocurrencies, a CBDC is issued directly by a country\u2019s central bank and can be programmed to prohibit certain transactions. DeSantis signed state-level legislation in May banning the issuance of a federal CBDC within Florida\u2019s borders, blasting it as a tool for financial surveillance.\n\nAfter announcing his campaign bid, DeSantis joined Elon Musk in a Twitter Spaces to expand upon his position, and insisted that citizens have \u201cevery right to do Bitcoin.\u201d While supportive of the technology, he also claimed that the network is doomed if Biden gets re-elected.\n\n\u201cBitcoin represents a threat to them,\u201d DeSantis said at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to regulate it out of existence.\u201d\n\nBetween restrictions on banking access and regulatory clampdowns, major crypto firms from the United States are already migrating overseas, or developing plans to do so. Meanwhile, some industry leaders such as Coinbase and Grayscale are battling the government in court for the freedom to launch their products despite a widely regarded absence of regulatory clarity.\n\nWhile members of Congress are trying to push legislation through to provide more clarity, Rep Patrick McHenry (R-NC) has called out the White House for refusing to negotiate on such matters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLike DeSantis, other Presidential candidates\u2014including Francis Suarez and Robert Kennedy Jr.\u2014have made their support for Bitcoin widely known. The latter has also proposed partially backing the dollar with Bitcoin and eliminating capital gains taxes from sales of the asset."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly requested Coinbase to stop trading in all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin (BTC) before suing America\u2019s largest crypto exchange last month, according to a report by the Financial Times citing CEO Brian Armstrong.\n\n\u201cThey came back to us, and they said [. . .] we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security,\u201d said Coinbase CEO. \u201cAnd, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that\u2019s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we\u2019re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nA Coinbase spokesperson told Decrypt that the interview \"omitted critical context regarding [Coinbase's] conversations with the SEC in the US,\" adding that \"per the SEC\u2019s own admission, the views shared in the FT article may have represented the views of some staff at the time, but did not represent those of the Commission more broadly.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC didn't immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nIn a June lawsuit, the SEC accused Coinbase of operating illegally because it failed to register as an exchange. The regulator also alleged the exchange\u2019s staking service offered at least 13 crypto assets that should have been registered as securities, including tokens such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and The Sandbox (SAND).\n\nIn a separate move, the SEC also sued Binance in June for offering unregistered securities and allowing U.S. investors to access its global website Binance.com. The Wall Street regulator also alleged that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and the crypto exchange misused and commingled customers' funds.\n\nAccording to Armstrong, had Coinbase agreed to the request, it would have set a precedent and may have led to the regulator cracking down on the majority of American crypto businesses operating under similar conditions.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t have a choice at that point, delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US,\u201d said Armstrong. \u201cIt kind of made it an easy choice [. . .] let\u2019s go to court and find out what the court says.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe regulator reportedly said its enforcement division did not make formal requests for \u201ccompanies to delist crypto assets.\u201d\n\nThe Coinbase representative added that the crypto exchange is still in discussions with the SEC and believes \"that transparent and fair rulemaking and Congressional action, such as bills that we saw gain bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives last week, represent the best path forward for American crypto users and the companies building the cryptoeconomy in the U.S.\u201d\n\nGensler on Bitcoin\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously suggested that all cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin are securities.\n\nHe\u2019s also often been citing the lack of investor protection as a reason for enforcement actions against crypto companies, comparing the sector to \u201cthe Wild West.\u201d\n\nIn the June lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC, however, didn\u2019t mention Ethereum (ETH), the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, among those tokens it asserted to be securities.\n\nOn June 28, the San Francisco-based company filed a motion to dismiss the SEC\u2019s lawsuit, arguing that the agency does not have statutory authority over the exchange and that its position regarding its powers is \u201cuntenable as a matter of law.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated on July 31, 2023 at 6 am Eastern Standard Time to include comment from Coinbase."

        "title": "Investors can expect another shake-up in cryptocurrency prices soon: Here's why - Gulf News",
        "content": "Dubai: The recent developments in the cryptocurrency industry are quite intriguing and require constant monitoring if you have invested in digital currencies.\n\nIf we examine the changes that have occurred thus far, we can see that technological advancements, regulatory changes, and market sentiments are influencing and propelling the cryptocurrency market, particularly its prices.\n\nThe prices of cryptocurrencies may continue to fluctuate, particularly in light of two significant events that will take place in a few days and over the coming months. Here, I will discuss these two events which will help determine your next crypto investment step.\n\nThe two significant events that investors should keep a watch on are the \u2018Halving\u2019 of one of the most popular \u2018Altcoins\u2019, Litecoin (LTC), on August 2, 2023, and the \u2018Halving\u2019 of Bitcoin, which will occur on April 21, 2024.\n\nGlossary: \u2018Altcoins\u2019, \u2018Crypto Halving\u2019 An Altcoin is an alternative digital currency to Bitcoin, the first and oldest cryptocurrency. The word Altcoin, which combines words \u2018alternative\u2019 and \u2018coin\u2019, essentially refers to all the cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\u2018Crypto Halving\u2019, or \u2018Halvening\u2019, is an event that reduces the number of new coins or tokens being generated by the network. It happens every four years and is crucial for traders because limiting supply of new coins could potentially raise crypto prices if demand for the coin remains strong.\n\n\n\nThis pre-programmed change to the underlying blockchain technology, primarily affects crypto \u2018miners\u2019, who are awarded crypto to solve complex math problems on high-powered computers to validate each crypto transaction. Such \u2018block\u2019 rewards are halved every four years to curb inflation.\n\nIt is anticipated that the \u2018Halving\u2019 of Litecoin and Bitcoin will influence the entire cryptocurrency market this year.\n\n\u2018Halving\u2019 events captivate investors, buyers\n\nThe \u2018Halving\u2019 of a cryptocurrency reduces the quantity of rewards paid to miners by half. Historically, \u2018Halving\u2019 events have captivated investors and buyers, resulting in increased market activity.\n\nIt is anticipated that the \u2018Halving\u2019 of Litecoin and Bitcoin will influence the entire cryptocurrency market this year. Any trend impacting these cryptocurrencies can spill over to the prices of other cryptocurrencies, boosting (or hindering) market confidence as a whole.\n\nLitecoin is scheduled to have its third \u2018Halving\u2019 event, which occurs every 840,000 blocks, every four years approximately, and reduces its reward per block to 6.25 LTC from 12.5 LTC per block. (\u2018Blocks\u2019, individual units making up blockchains, are where crypto transactions are stored.)\n\nHow \u2018Halving\u2019 events previously affected Litecoin rewards? The last two Litecoin \u2018Halving\u2019 events were recorded during 2015 and 2019: The 2015 Litecoin \u2018Halving\u2019 reduced the block reward from 50 LTC per block to 25 LTC per block, whereas the 2019 Litecoin \u2018Halving\u2019 reduced the block reward from 25 LTC per block to 12.5 LTC per block.\n\nThe halving of Litecoin can significantly affect its price due to the changes it will bring to LTC's supply and demand. As a consequence of the reduction in the block reward, the supply and issuance of new Litecoin in the market will be reduced or constrained.\n\nIf demand remains constant or increases, the scarcity of Litecoin could lead to speculative buying, which would drive the prices up. (\u2018Speculative buying\u2019 is buying an asset that can earn you gains quickly. However, with \u2018speculative buying\u2019, there is an increased chance of big losses as well.)\n\nThis potentially positive trend in Litecoin can also influence the Altcoin market as a whole, increasing interest and investment in all Altcoins.\n\nHow Litecoin \u2018Halving\u2019 can affect Altcoin prices\n\nThis potentially positive trend in Litecoin can also influence the Altcoin market as a whole, increasing interest and investment in all Altcoins. Separately, it may also contribute to a positive trend in Bitcoin, given that both currencies share technological similarities, thereby strengthening other cryptocurrencies and the market as a whole.\n\nThe second comparable event is the \u2018Halving\u2019 of Bitcoin rewards next year, which will reduce miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nBitcoin prices fluctuates a lot before \u2018Halving\u2019 events If we look at Bitcoin's recent prices, after a significant decline last October to nearly $15,782 (Dh57,968), prices rose to $16,547.91 (Dh60,781.55) in January this year. Since then, Bitcoin prices doubled, bringing the total crypto market back to $1.181 trillion (Dh4.34 trillion, as of July 31, 2023).\n\n\n\nIn particular, Bitcoin rose to $30,000 (Dh110,191) by mid-April this year, fluctuating throughout May and June, and reaching $31,474.72 (Dh115,608) on July 14 - its highest value since the beginning of the year. As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin is worth $29,407.12 (Dh108,014.26).\n\n\n\nBitcoin \u2018Halving\u2019 events boosted prices in the past\n\nHowever, the current price trajectory of Bitcoin could see a further positive jump, especially while anticipating the upcoming Bitcoin \u2018Halving\u2019. Historically, Bitcoin's \u2018Halving\u2019 has had a significant effect on its price.\n\nFor instance, the previous \u2018Halving\u2019 of Bitcoin in 2020 triggered a considerable gain, that drove its price to $64,900 (Dh238,381.92) in the following months. Hence, observing past patterns, we can anticipate a looming boom for Bitcoin.\n\nUltimately, whether the impact of \u2018Halving\u2019 will bring a surge and new highs or a decline, it will take time to play out.\n\nBottom line?\n\nIn a nutshell, the cryptocurrency market is making a comeback. Many are anticipating how the Litecoin and Bitcoin \u2018Halving\u2019 events will shake-up markets, while speculating on the effects they will have on the prices of these currencies and their performance.\n\nUltimately, whether the impact of \u2018Halving\u2019 will bring a surge and new highs or a decline, it will take time to play out. So as an investor, you will need to undertake additional analysis and keep an eye on such trends that could affect the cryptocurrency market in the near future."

        "title": "Billionaire M. Novogratz identifies game-changing Bitcoin event in 2023 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced fluctuations in 2023, with the cryptocurrency striving to surpass the $30,000 mark and overcome the remnants of last year\u2019s bear market. Notably, one of the highlights of the year for Bitcoin was the renewed interest shown by institutional investors in the asset.\n\nIn this line, billionaire and Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz has shared his views on the state of Bitcoin in 2023. According to Novogratz, the turning point came when Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the world\u2019s largest asset manager, openly embraced Bitcoin and became a fervent supporter, he said during an interview with Bloomberg on July 29.\n\nNovogratz coined the term \u2018orange-pilled\u2019 to describe Fink\u2019s transformation. It\u2019s worth noting that Fink was initially skeptical about Bitcoin\u2019s merits before becoming an advocate for the digital currency.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink. <\u2026> He got \u2018orange-pilled,\u2019 as we say. Orange pill is when you take a nonbeliever, and you make them a believer in Bitcoin. <\u2026.> Larry was a nonbeliever. Now he says, \u2018Hey, this is going to be a global currency.\u2019 People around the world all trust it,\u201d Novogratz said.\n\nImpact of BlackRock on Bitcoin price\n\nAccording to Novogratz, BlackRock\u2019s strong drive towards a spot Bitcoin Exchnage Traded Fund (ETF) and Fink\u2019s changing perspective form a crucial \u201cadoption cycle\u201d that could propel Bitcoin to attain another record high.\n\nPart of Fink\u2019s skepticism was captured in a Finbold report that indicated that back in 2018, the executive had stated that clients had \u2018zero interest\u2019 in cryptocurrencies. At the time, he pointed out that the company will only be interested in cryptocurrencies once established structures are in place.\n\nHowever, the U.S. is yet to enact comprehensive regulations to manage the crypto sector, and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has faced criticism for allegedly attempting to stifle the industry.\n\nThe endorsement from Fink and his influence within the financial industry is seen as substantial validation of Bitcoin\u2019s position as a legitimate and increasingly mainstream asset. Notably, the crypto market and Bitcoin received a reprieve, recording significant short-term gains following the BlackRock ETF filing.\n\nCurrently, attention has turned to the SEC to see if they will approve the ETF. A previous Finbold report revealed that the asset management firm has a good track record with the regulator.\n\nOn the other hand, Novogratz remains a Bitcoin bull, banking on the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential future growth. For instance, the investor has stated that investing in cryptocurrencies can be considered a smart move, especially given the prevailing economic conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin continues to trade below $30,000 while attempting to avoid further decline. By press time, Bitcoin was valued at $28,287.\n\nRead more crypto news."
