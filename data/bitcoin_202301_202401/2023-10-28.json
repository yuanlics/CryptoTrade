        "title": "Bitcoin: Buy the Dip? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the first half of 2023, the surprising turnaround for Bitcoin (BTC -3.18%) was the talk of the crypto industry. Bitcoin skyrocketed right out of the gate, and by mid-July, had nearly doubled in price to $32,000. However, since then, Bitcoin's fortunes have cooled considerably. Bitcoin is trading around $28,000 as of this writing, a nearly 15% haircut from its intra-year high.\n\nSo is now the time to buy the dip on Bitcoin? After all, according to the Bitcoin bulls, the world's most popular cryptocurrency is simply taking a breather before once again marching higher. Are they right or wrong?\n\nChanging investor perceptions\n\nIf you are a long-term crypto investor, the good news is that the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains largely unchanged. Bitcoin adoption rates worldwide continue to grow, Bitcoin still accounts for nearly 50% of the market cap of the entire crypto industry, and Bitcoin is still the crypto of choice for institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe bad news, though, is that investor perceptions about Bitcoin have changed. For institutional investors, the macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. economy has been front and center, and with so much uncertainty surrounding monetary policy and the future path of interest rates, it's perhaps only natural that Bitcoin has stalled out around the $30,000 level. The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that risk assets (such as cryptocurrencies) do not perform well in high-interest-rate environments, so the Federal Reserve has emerged as a crucial factor in how investors view Bitcoin.\n\nAt one time, Bitcoin was largely uncorrelated with broader U.S. financial markets, and investors viewed Bitcoin as providing similar hedging benefits as gold. But that viewpoint has been steadily changing. Based on changing correlations between different asset classes, it now appears that Bitcoin is trading much more like a big tech stock. The important point here is that Bitcoin's correlation with other asset classes changes over time, and that influences how investors view Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional money and Bitcoin\n\nIf there's one factor that can decisively move Bitcoin higher in the near and medium terms, it's the flow of new institutional money into Bitcoin. At one time, institutional investors wouldn't touch Bitcoin with a 10-foot pole. But, oh, how times have changed. The first big break came in August 2022, when BlackRock entered into a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global to enable institutional access to crypto assets.\n\nSince then, the floodgates have opened. One development that has captured the attention of investors this year is the upcoming introduction of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market. The process started this summer, when BlackRock announced plans for a spot Bitcoin ETF. After that, other high-profile institutional investors -- including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest -- jumped in with spot Bitcoin ETF applications of their own. Once one of these applications is approved, it could lead to a huge new inflow of institutional money into Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nIn April, Bitcoin will experience another \"halving\" event, in which the reward paid out to cryptocurrency miners for mining a new block of Bitcoin is cut by one-half. In three previous halving cycles (2012, 2016, and 2020), the price of Bitcoin has soared, and many Bitcoin analysts are expecting the same to happen in 2024. While past performance is no guarantee of future performance, it certainly hints at Bitcoin's long-term price potential.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank, for example, is predicting a price of $100,000 for Bitcoin by the end of 2024. And Pantera Capital, a crypto hedge fund, has set a price target of $149,000 for Bitcoin.\n\nThe theory is that the halving, by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created in the future, will introduce a scarcity effect. As long as demand remains constant or increases, the price of Bitcoin should increase.\n\nDollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin\n\nBased on the above, I'm bullish on Bitcoin's future prospects. From my perspective, the only thing that has changed is investor perceptions about Bitcoin. As a result, now could be the perfect time to start dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin. By buying the same amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., once per month), you would limit (but not eliminate) downside risk while also getting access to Bitcoin's enormous upside potential.\n\nIf you are expecting Bitcoin to regain its momentum heading into 2024, then dollar-cost averaging could be an effective strategy to accumulate Bitcoin."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nSam Bankman-Fried takes the stand on FTX\u2019s collapse\n\nSam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried testified this week in his ongoing criminal trial in the Southern District of New York, denying any wrongdoing between FTX and Alameda Research while acknowledging making \u201cbig mistakes\u201d during the companies\u2019 explosive growth. Highlights of his testimony include denying directing his inner circle to make significant political donations in 2021, as well as claims that FTX\u2019s terms of use covered transactions between Alameda and the crypto exchange. Additionally, Bankman-Fried testified that he requested additional hedging strategies for Alameda in 2021 and 2022, but they were never implemented. The trial is expected to conclude within the next few days.\n\n\u2018Buy Bitcoin\u2019 search queries on Google surge 826% in the UK\n\nGoogle searches for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d have surged worldwide amid a major crypto rally, with searches in the United Kingdom growing by more than 800% in the last week. According to research from Cryptogambling.tv, the search term \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d spiked a staggering 826% in the U.K. over the course of seven days. In the United States, data from Google Trends shows that searches for \u201cshould I buy Bitcoin now?\u201d increased by more than 250%, while more niche searches, including \u201ccan I buy Bitcoin on Fidelity?\u201d increased by over 3,100% in the last week. Zooming out further, the search term \u201cis it a good time to buy Bitcoin?\u201d saw a 110% gain worldwide over the last week.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals has issued a mandate following a decision requiring Grayscale Investments\u2019 application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In an Oct. 23 filing, the \u201cformal mandate\u201d of the court took effect, paving the way for the SEC to review its decision on Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF. The mandate followed the court\u2019s initial ruling on Aug. 29 and the SEC\u2019s failure to present an appeal by Oct. 13. To date, the SEC has yet to approve a single spot crypto ETF for listing on U.S. exchanges but has given the green light to investment vehicles linked to Bitcoin and Ether futures.\n\nCoinbase disputes SEC\u2019s crypto authority in final bid to toss regulator\u2019s suit\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission overstepped its authority when it classified Coinbase-listed cryptocurrencies as securities, the exchange has argued in its final bid to dismiss a lawsuit by the securities regulator. In an Oct. 24 filing in a New York District Court, Coinbase chastised the SEC, claiming its definition for what qualifies as a security was too wide, and contested that the cryptocurrencies the exchange lists are not under the regulator\u2019s purview. The SEC sued Coinbase on June 6, claiming the exchange violated U.S. securities laws by listing several tokens it considers securities and not registering with the regulator.\n\nGemini sues Genesis over GBTC shares used as Earn collateral, now worth $1.6B\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Gemini filed a lawsuit against bankrupt crypto lender Genesis on Oct. 27. At issue is the fate of 62,086,586 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. They were used as collateral to secure loans made by 232,000 Gemini users to Genesis through the Gemini Earn Program. That collateral is currently worth close to $1.6 billion. According to the suit, Gemini has received $284.3 million from foreclosing on the collateral for the benefit of Earn users, but Genesis has disputed the action, preventing Gemini from distributing the proceeds. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January. It had suspended withdrawals in November 2022, which impacted the Gemini Earn program.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $34,143, Ether (ETH) at $1,789 and XRP at $0.54.

        "title": "3 Reasons Bitcoin Is a Screaming Buy - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After losing 64% of its value in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC -3.18%) has been on an absolute tear this year. As of this writing, the leading digital asset has soared 107% in 2023. And after the past couple of weeks, Bitcoin is now knocking on the door of $35,000.\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in a hugely positive price swing, with the intention of trying to ride the strong momentum. But before doing that, investors should really take the time to understand more about what makes Bitcoin a good investment opportunity.\n\nHere are three must-know reasons this top cryptocurrency is a screaming buy right now.\n\n1. Its absolute scarcity\n\nOne of Bitcoin's defining characteristics is that there will only ever be 21 million coins in circulation. There is a hard cap on the supply that is etched into the cryptocurrency's computer code. And unless the majority of the crypto's stakeholders -- including users, nodes, miners, and developers -- all agree to change this supply constraint, this is basically set in stone.\n\nA fixed supply is valuable because when demand rises, the price should as well; there is no way for supply to increase to match heightened demand. That's why Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed throughout its history.\n\nThis reality is in stark contrast to fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar or the euro, which are constantly losing purchasing power because of ongoing money printing and inflation. In fact, the purchasing power of $1 has dropped more than 95% since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913.\n\nSome investors might view gold as having absolute scarcity, but this is inaccurate -- the supply does increase every year. And let's say that demand for the precious metal was to jump significantly in short order. In this scenario, it would be economically feasible for mining companies to try to extract gold from difficult-to-reach areas, so there is the possibility that supply could increase to meet demand.\n\n2. Its ownership by key figures\n\nSince its launch roughly 15 years ago, Bitcoin has been adopted by individuals mainly interested in computer science, cryptography, and privacy. But these days, because its market cap is $663 billion and there is a growing list of financial products and services supporting it, the digital currency is slowly finding itself more and more in the mainstream.\n\nSome prominent business figures have publicly announced their bullishness for the asset. Michael Saylor, billionaire founder of MicroStrategy, has purchased billions of dollars of Bitcoin, which his corporation holds on its balance sheet. Jack Dorsey, another billionaire founder himself, is focused on helping to advance Bitcoin adoption through his payments company Block, which also holds some of it on its balance sheet.\n\nFund managers like Bill Miller and Paul Tudor Jones both own Bitcoin in their personal holdings. And famed investor Cathie Wood, who heads up Ark Invest, is probably the most bullish on it. Her firm's base-case analysis suggests that the price could hit $683,000 by 2030, up 20-fold from today's level.\n\n3. Its near-term catalysts\n\nPerhaps the most pressing reason to buy Bitcoin is the list of near-term catalysts on the horizon. Maybe the market is realizing this, as its price has risen 31% just in the last month (as of Oct. 26).\n\nMany large asset managers have filed applications for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The potential approval of these could introduce massive amounts of fresh capital to the crypto.\n\nThe upcoming halving, which is set for April 2024, is when Bitcoin's inflation rate gets cut in half. Historically, it has been a very bullish event for the price, both in the months leading up to it and in the months following.\n\nAnother possible catalyst is the chance that the Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates in 2024. The central bank could be close to reaching its goal of taming inflation, after which it might want to take a more accommodating stance toward the economy. And this would be a positive backdrop for risky assets like Bitcoin."

        "content": "Hopes of approval for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission boosted Bitcoin\u2019s price by 27% in October. This improved sentiment, attracting aggressive buying by crypto investors.\n\nBloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the first futures-based ETF to get regulatory consent in the U.S. in 2021, saw its second biggest trading week ever at $1.7 billion. Similarly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded a volume of $800 million. The sharp uptick in volume in the existing instruments shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs are likely to witness huge volumes when they see the light of the day.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nWhen the leader starts performing, it generally lifts the entire sector. That is seen in the strong performance of altcoins, which have risen sharply from their multi-year lows.\n\nHowever, after the initial rally, some altcoins will struggle to maintain their up-move while a few will lead the markets higher. It is better to stick with the leaders as they are most likely to outperform during the next crypto bull phase.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may extend their rally in the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin pulled back from $35,280 on Oct. 24, indicating that higher levels are attracting selling by traders. The bears tried to start a deeper pullback on Oct. 27 but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAlthough the rising moving averages indicate advantage to buyers, the overbought levels on the relative strength index (RSI) suggest that the BTC/USDT pair may spend some more time in consolidation.\n\nThe important level to watch out for on the downside is $32,400 and then $31,000. Sellers will have to pull the price below this zone to seize control.\n\nConversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $35,280, it will indicate the bulls are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may then surge to the next target objective at $40,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA is gradually flattening out, indicating that the bulls are losing their grip in the near term. That could keep the pair range-bound between $35,280 and $33,200 for some time. If the bears yank the price below $33,200, the pair may tumble to $32,400.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns up and rallies above $35,280, it will indicate that the current consolidation was a continuation pattern. The pair could then skyrocket toward $40,000.\n\nEther price analysis\n\nEther (ETH) climbed above the $1,746 resistance on Oct. 23 and reached $1,865 on Oct. 26. This level attracted selling by short-term traders which pulled the price back toward the breakout level of $1,746.\n\nETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls successfully defended the retest to $1,746, indicating that the level may act as a new floor. The rising 20-day EMA ($1,693) and the RSI near the overbought zone, indicate that the bulls are in command. Buyers will then strive to push the price above $1,865. If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could soar to $2,000.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to yank and sustain the price below $1,746. That could open the doors for a fall to the 20-day EMA.\n\nThe 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart is flattening out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a range-bound action in the near term. The pair may continue to swing between $1,746 and $1,865 for some time.\n\nIf bulls kick the price above $1,812, the likelihood of a rally to the overhead resistance of $1,865 increases. On the other hand, if the price maintains below the 20-EMA, the bears will attempt to tug the pair below $1,746. If that happens, the short-term trend will turn bearish.\n\nAptos (APT) price analysis\n\nAptos (APT) rallied sharply in the past few days, indicating that the bulls are attempting to make a comeback.\n\nAPT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe APT/USDT pair witnessed profit-booking near $7 but a minor positive is that the bulls did not give up much ground. This shows that every minor dip is being purchased. The bulls will again try to overcome the obstacle at $7. If they manage to do that, the pair may start its march toward $8.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from $7, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then spend some more time inside a tight range between $7 and $6.20. A break below this support could signal the start of a deeper correction.\n\nThe pair has been finding support at the 20-EMA but the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum may be slowing down. If the price breaks and sustains below the 20-EMA, it will indicate the start of a deeper correction to the 50-SMA.\n\nThis remains the key level to watch on the downside because if it cracks, the pair may slump to $5.80. On the upside, the bulls will have to thrust the price above $7.02 to indicate the start of the next leg of the recovery.\n\nRelated: Ripple CEO criticizes former SEC Chair Jay Clayton\u2019s comments\n\nQuant price analysis\n\nQuant (QNT) rose above the breakdown level of $95 on Oct. 23, indicating that the markets have rejected the lower levels. The buying continued and the bulls propelled the price above the downtrend line on Oct. 25. This signals a potential trend change.\n\nQNT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe short-term bulls seem to be booking profits after the recent rally. That may pull the price down to the downtrend line. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a drop below it may suggest that the rise above the downtrend line may have been a bull trap.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price snaps back from the downtrend line, it will suggest that the bulls have flipped the level into support. If buyers clear the hurdle at $110, it will indicate the resumption of the rally to $120 and then to $128.\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the QNT/USDT pair is facing selling near $108. The bears pulled the price below the 20-EMA, indicating that the short-term traders are booking profits. If the price slips below $103, the pair may drop to $100.\n\nInstead, if bulls sustain the price above the 20-EMA, it will suggest that lower levels continue to attract buyers. The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive the price above $110 and start the next leg of the up-move.\n\nTHORChain price analysis\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) broke and closed above the overhead resistance of $2 on Oct. 23, completing a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern.\n\nRUNE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone indicating that bulls remain in command. However, in the short term, the RUNE/USDT pair may enter a minor correction or consolidation.\n\nIf the pair does not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest that the bulls are holding on to their positions. That may improve the prospects of a rally to $3 and subsequently to the pattern target of $3.23. If bears want to prevent this uptrend, they will have to pull and sustain the price below $2.\n\nThe pair has been in a strong uptrend with the bulls buying the dips to the 20-EMA. Although the upsloping moving averages indicate advantage to buyers, the negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening.\n\nIf the price skids below the 20-EMA, it could tempt short-term traders to book profits. That could pull the price to the 50-SMA.\n\nContrarily, if the price rebounds off the 20-EMA with strength, it will signal that the sentiment remains positive. The bulls will then try to resume the up-move with a break and close above $2.57.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
