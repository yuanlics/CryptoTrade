        "title": "Bitcoin leaves the rest of the crypto market behind - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Fintech myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the final edition this year of the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re looking at the digital coin that bitcoin is threatening to leave behind. We\u2019ll be back on January 13th.\n\nOne common \u2014 and not always unfair \u2014 criticism made by crypto enthusiasts is that the wider world conflates bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf the subject comes up over Christmas, chances are family and friends will use the two interchangeably. In their minds bitcoin IS the crypto market. Yet people working around it, or even have more than a passing interest, know there is much more going on.\n\nRight now, bitcoin is in a happier place than it has been for 18 months, supported by speculation that the SEC will approve a bitcoin exchange traded fund after Christmas. But the rest of the market doesn\u2019t quite have that same warm fuzzy feeling.\n\nA large chunk of \u201cthe rest\u201d is ether, the second largest cryptocurrency on the market, because of the blockchain it represents, ethereum.\n\nEthereum has always been a more ambitious project than the bitcoin blockchain, which is a database for transactions. It can hold assets and lets programmers code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts. That means it is the foundation for so much of the industry\u2019s non-bitcoin activity ranging from decentralised finance (DeFi) projects and NFTs to gaming.\n\nHistorically, these markets have given ethereum a unique position of strength over competing blockchains: if one sector of the industry explodes, so should ether.\n\nBut while ether has climbed a respectable 93 per cent this year, it has underperformed bitcoin (up 162 per cent), Solana (up over 550 per cent), and Cardano (up 154 per cent).\n\n\u201cThis year ether has been totally outshined by the excitement related to bitcoin,\u201d said CK Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZK Squared Capital.\n\nFor ether, the problem is that these cutting-edge crypto projects, like decentralised finance, NFTs and gaming \u2014 the ethereum network\u2019s bread and butter \u2014 still haven\u2019t shaken off their past.\n\nProjects like DeFi crypto exchange Uniswap have yet to generate any mainstream buzz, crypto-inspired games like Axie Infinity are today synonymous with North Korean hacking exploits, and NFTs have only recently made headlines for blinding party goers in Hong Kong.\n\nAs far as the non-bitcoin crypto market is concerned, the coins that have performed best this year are the ones exploring the links between crypto and artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe demand for AI investments has found its way into crypto,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive at investment adviser at Lumida Wealth Management. \u201cCrypto tokens linked to AI have emerged as one of the strongest crypto investing themes,\u201d he added.\n\nWhether there are overlaps between crypto and AI is a theme for another day. For now, they are the kingfishers catching the sunlight. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see the far superior returns of AI-related tokens compared to other tokens,\u201d added Zheng, adding that these tokens will be \u201cthe most exciting theme going into 2024.\u201d\n\nBut ethereum\u2019s lacklustre year behind bitcoin is not all down to being superseded by the latest tech hype cycle. US regulators are still pursuing cases that could end up defining ether and other crypto tokens as securities.\n\nAnd ethereum also has to face up to its own disappointments. In September last year the network underwent a supposedly revolutionary surgery with the \u201cMerge\u201d. It was a technical operation, blending one ethereum blockchain with another, but came with big promises.\n\nBefore the Merge, if the ethereum network were a country, it would have ranked in the world\u2019s top 35 by energy consumption, surpassing nations like Belgium and Finland.\n\nThe Merge virtually eliminated the network\u2019s carbon footprint, and when I dedicated 2,500 words to ethereum\u2019s supposed revolution, everyone I spoke to told me it was the removal of the biggest obstacle to mainstream adoption. Ether would even come on to the radars of ESG-conscious investors.\n\nIn fact, the anticipation for a record-setting future was so intense that YouTube\u2019s former head of gaming Ryan Wyatt told me that crypto could soon focus on \u201conboarding the next billion users.\u201d\n\nBut the price of ether fell in the months after the Merge, and while it has recovered, those billion users haven\u2019t materialised.\n\n\u201cIf the expectation was that the Merge would boost investments from ESG-minded investors I think that expectation would be premature,\u201d said Alex de Vries, co-founder of Digiconomist, a website that tracks the environmental impact of the crypto industry.\n\nInstead, ether is at risk of being eclipsed by bitcoin. At the time of the Merge, bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation represented roughly 40 per cent of the entire crypto market and ethereum\u2019s share was 18 per cent, according to industry data aggregator CoinMarketCap.\n\nToday ethereum accounts for 17 per cent while bitcoin\u2019s share has expanded to 52 per cent.\n\nIf conversations with family and friends this Christmas do veer down the cryptocurrency road, good luck in explaining it. And even better luck in explaining how it\u2019s not all about bitcoin.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on ether\u2019s future? As always, email me your thoughts at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nEarlier this week failed crypto exchange FTX settled with its debtors after its collapse in November last year. The agreement, subject to the approvals of the US bankruptcy court and Supreme Court of The Bahamas, will pool the assets of the FTX debtors and exchange\u2019s Bahamian unit to ensure customers receive \u201csubstantially identical relative distributions.\u201d\n\nETF speculation heated up yet again this week when BlackRock \u2014 the largest asset manager in the world \u2014 disclosed in a fresh filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its proposed fund would only allow new shares to be created with cash, instead of bitcoin. The move, while hardly groundbreaking, was taken as yet another sign that the Wall Street giant is making headway with the regulator.\n\nSoundbite of the week: A big freeze from the BVI\n\nRemember Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, founders of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital? Sadly the courts won\u2019t leave them alone to continue painting and surfing.\n\nA court in the British Virgin Islands this week issued a worldwide freezing order hitting over $1bn of their assets. The order also goes after Kelly Chen, Davies\u2019s wife, representing the latest effort by the liquidators to return assets to creditors of the collapsed business.\n\nThe order turns up the heat on the disgraced founders by closing as many possible avenues available to access funds. Zhu was imprisoned in Singapore in September for four months for failing to co-operate with investigations into Three Arrows\u2019 failure; the whereabouts of Davies remains unknown.\n\n\u201cThe order is specifically designed to prevent the founders and Ms Kelly Chen from disposing of or otherwise dealing with assets in any way that might frustrate eventual enforcement by the liquidators.\u201d\n\nData Mining: Tether\u2019s Christmas naughty list\n\nLast month Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin, signed up the US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Secret Service to help prevent illicit use of its USDT token.\n\nUnsurprisingly the number of blacklisted Tether wallets has shot higher. Total numbers of banned wallets are up 20 per cent to 1,236 so far this month, according to CCData.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

        "title": "SEC holds calls with spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls as possible approval nears - Fox Business",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission is wasting no time preparing the financial industry for possibly the biggest regulatory event in the history of the $1.6 trillion crypto market: The potential approval of a \"spot\" bitcoin ETF in the new year.\n\nSEC staffers held separate telephone conference calls with spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls on Thursday afternoon, FOX Business has learned. The calls involved some minutiae on the application process, but also delivered a definitive message on how the ETFs need to be structured. The agency staffers said the SEC will only consider applications that structure an ETF that allows issuers to only buy the product using cash instead of so-called \"in kind\" purchases using bitcoin. Similarly, redemptions of the ETF must be provided only in cash.\n\nAny mention of in-kind purchases or redemptions must be stricken from the application, SEC staffers said, FOX Business has learned.\n\nSEC COULD MAKE CRYPTO HISTORY IN NEW YEAR WITH FIRST SPOT BITCOIN ETF APPROVAL\n\nThe cash-only structure is key for the SEC and has been controversial for the money managers seeking approval. Most other ETFs allow both in-kind purchases and redemptions as well as cash. But the SEC believes that bitcoin ETFs present additional regulatory challenges not found in such plain vanilla offerings. It\u2019s demanding cash only because it\u2019s worried about possible malfeasance involved in using crypto for purchases and redemptions. Additionally, the agency doesn\u2019t currently allow broker-dealers to trade spot bitcoin directly like it does other commodities.\n\nAt least two money managers are seeking SEC approval for the product: BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, and crypto asset manager Grayscale have been hesitant to give up the fight for in-kind creations, arguing that the process is more efficient and will result in a more robust trading market.\n\nVALKYRIE INVESTMENTS FIRST TO OFFER ETHER FUTURES THROUGH ETF\n\nFOX Business was first to report about the SEC's outreach. It is unclear whether the SEC called all prospective issuers of the spot bitcoin ETF, but FOX Business confirmed that calls were held with BlackRock, Valkyrie, Grayscale, Ark 21Shares and Bitwise. Also called by the SEC were the exchanges where the respective issuers plan to issue their ETFs, the Nasdaq and CBOE stock markets.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BLK BLACKROCK INC. 809.12 -16.92 -2.05% BITO PROSHARES TRUST BITCOIN STRATEGY ETF 31.77 -1.88 -5.59% BITQ EXCHANGE TRADED CONCEPTS TRUST BITWISE CRYPTO INNOVATORS E 11.65 -0.69 -5.59% CBOE CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS INC. 181.31 -2.33 -1.27% NDAQ NASDAQ INC. 58.69 -0.85 -1.43%\n\nThe SEC declined comment.\n\nNews of the calls has fueled speculation among some industry participants that the agency could be gearing up to approve applications before the end of the year, instead of January. However, the SEC is a government agency, and many staffers will be off over the Christmas period. Additionally, FOX Business has learned that the SEC asked issuers to submit amended filings by December 29.\n\n\"It is apparent from all the subsequent S-1 filings that the commission directed the change to cash creates, seemingly as a final hurdle before passage,\" said CoinRoutes co-CEO David Weisberger, \"While timing is not certain, it seems likely to happen before the next deadline on January 10.\"\n\nThe price of bitcoin has spiked 64% over the past three months for a number of reasons, including anticipation that SEC approval of the spot bitcoin ETF will mainstream the crypto business. The SEC could reject the applications, of course, given Chairman Gary Gensler's long-held criticism of the digital coin market as the \"wild west\" of investing and rife with fraud, typified by the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the conviction of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nStill, based on conversations with the SEC staff, asset managers remain confident that a favorable decision from the SEC will be made on or before Jan. 10, as FOX Business first reported Wednesday. That is the deadline for the commission to rule on the first spot bitcoin ETF application from Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark 21Shares."

        "title": "If History Repeats Itself, I Expect Bitcoin to Surge Even Higher in 2024. Here's Why. - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Looking back at 2023, a key development has been the resurgence of the cryptocurrency market. The industry's current valuation of over $1.6 trillion is about 100% higher than it was nearly 12 months ago.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most valuable digital asset, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), has also benefited tremendously. But bigger gains could be on the horizon.\n\nEven though Bitcoin has climbed 154% in 2023 (as of Dec. 20), I expect this top cryptocurrency to surge even higher in 2024. Here's why.\n\nA major catalyst for Bitcoin on the horizon\n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin operates what is known as a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This means that so-called miners must expend computational power and electricity (the \"work\") to win the right to approve transactions to the blockchain. For this effort, miners receive a reward in the form of newly created Bitcoin.\n\nAbout every four years, the reward that miners get for doing this essential task gets cut in half, in an event known as a \"halving.\" Bitcoin and crypto observers are likely aware that the next halving event is slated to take place in April 2024. After this point, miners will get 3.125 new coins each time they approve transactions.\n\nWhy is this so important for Bitcoin? Well, if history is any indication, Bitcoin's price is poised to continue soaring in the next 12 months and perhaps even longer.\n\nThe last Bitcoin halving took place in May 2020. In the two months before, the crypto's price rose 65%. And in the 18 months after, Bitcoin skyrocketed 616% to reach its all-time high of under $69,000 in November 2021. A similar situation played out around the halving events in 2016 and 2012.\n\nConceptually, it makes sense why this has typically been a bullish situation. Over the past decade, demand for Bitcoin has increased. This is due to it becoming more widely adopted as a store of value. The fact that Bitcoin is also getting recognition as a legitimate financial asset from incumbent institutions, corporations, and governments also helps.\n\nAt the same time that demand rises, new Bitcoin entering the market has decreased every four or so years. Restricting supply is the other key ingredient, and maybe the more important one, that drives up the digital asset's price. The Bitcoin halving is a key aspect of the blockchain network, and it supports the enforcement of there ever only being 21 million coins in circulation.\n\nInvestors should maintain a long-term mindset\n\nBefore you rush to buy Bitcoin in the hopes of generating outsized returns in 2024, it's worth mentioning that investors should still maintain a long-term perspective. This is an asset that deserves a 10-year mental outlook, not a 12-month one.\n\nBitcoin will continue to be volatile, even though it has historically done a fantastic job of rewarding investors. By staying focused on the next several years, you can have the conviction needed to avoid selling at the wrong times, and consequently hurting your portfolio's potential returns.\n\nThe economic backdrop also can't be ignored, as things are still very uncertain. While the Federal Reserve might feel confident enough to cut rates in 2024, the U.S. could still experience a harsh recession. I honestly don't think anyone has any clue what the economic situation will look like next year. If things go south, Bitcoin could be negatively affected as capital flees to what people view as safer and less risky assets.\n\nThese points are only made to help investors temper expectations. Nonetheless, now might be one of the best times to buy Bitcoin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Could Bitcoin reach $100,000 in 2024? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's hard to believe that Bitcoin (BTC -6.04%) was in the depths of a brutal crypto winter just a year ago, falling as low as $16,735. Fast-forward to today, and Bitcoin is up more than 160% in 2023, hitting a yearly high of just over $43,000. By all accounts, the crypto winter has thawed.\n\nThis level of resurgence isn't uncommon for Bitcoin, especially after bear markets. However, it does raise the question: How much more momentum could Bitcoin have? Could it ride this wave and reach the coveted six-figure mark of $100,000 in 2024, or would that be too big of a jump too fast?\n\nGetting the lay of the land\n\nFor Bitcoin to reach $100,000, it would need to increase by another 130%. Considering Bitcoin has notched average yearly returns of 167% over the course of its existence, it is undoubtedly within the realm of possibility. But just how likely is it?\n\nTo answer this question holistically, we need to explore a handful of other developments, rather than just taking the average of Bitcoin's performance in years past. In doing so, we should be able to project Bitcoin's path in 2024 more confidently.\n\nTo reiterate, this is all pure speculation. But by taking a comprehensive view of data, recent trends, and history, one can hope to paint a reasonably accurate picture of Bitcoin's future.\n\nThe effect of the halving\n\nWhile Bitcoin's performance in 2023 was impressive, it doesn't take away from the importance of what's coming in 2024. Hardwired into Bitcoin's code are events known as halvings. Every time another 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain -- roughly every four years -- the amount of tokens paid to miners for validating transactions is cut by half. These halvings of the token supply growth rate alter the dynamics around Bitcoin's supply and demand.\n\nThe halving slated for April 2024 will cut Bitcoin's current growth rate of around 1.7% to just 0.85%. This might not sound like a big deal, but past data shows it profoundly affects Bitcoin's price.\n\nIn the previous years that halvings have taken place, Bitcoin's price has increased by an average of about 128% as the growth of the total token supply became more constrained. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, a 128% increase from today's prices would put it at just over $99,000.\n\nHistorically low supply\n\nWhile halvings have historically been catalysts for price appreciation to a degree that would push it close to the $100,000 mark, additional developments in the Bitcoin universe could put that $100,000 level well within reach. Reason No. 1 is related to an existing supply crunch, which will only be amplified by the halving.\n\nBitcoin investors are notoriously stubborn about buying and holding through market fluctuations. Due to this behavior, investors have accumulated more Bitcoin at a historic rate over the last few years, pushing it into unprecedented territory. Data shows that the number of tokens available on exchanges increased until March 2020 (Bitcoin's last halving), peaking at nearly 3.2 million coins. But during this latest period of accumulation, the tradable supply has shrunk. It currently sits at 2.3 million tokens, a level last seen in the spring of 2018. As such, the upcoming halving will be the first in Bitcoin's history when fewer coins are on the market than during the previous one.\n\nNew game changers will add fresh demand\n\nFor years, Bitcoin investors claimed that deep-pocketed institutions would join the game. Well, now they're here. Some of Wall Street's biggest names, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, are awaiting approval to sponsor spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With a blessing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looking more likely by the day, the ETF will open the way for Bitcoin to be added to pensions, individual retirement accounts, and 401(k) savings accounts.\n\nLast but not least is the renewed interest in Bitcoin development. For most of Bitcoin's history, its lack of functionality led to it being used primarily as a store of value or for speculation. But thanks to recent advancements, such as the development of Layer-2 solutions, Bitcoin can now be utilized in other ways -- to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), engage with DeFi platforms, or as a reliable payment solution.\n\nA historically low supply combined with next year's halving leads me to believe $100,000 Bitcoin is in the cards for 2024. But that might only be scratching the surface of what's possible. As Bitcoin continues to push through traditional barriers and expand into the decentralized economy, its long-term value proposition only grows stronger. While I usually prefer to be conservative in my projections, a price of $100,000 per Bitcoin next year seems like a safe bet. But given Bitcoin's disruptive force, who knows what incredible potential lies beyond 2024?"

Milei's victory was seen as a positive sign for crypto adoption in Argentina, given his previous statements supporting Bitcoin and his belief in the private sector's role in money creation. Milei came to power amid pressing inflation in the country, and the economic decree was part of his first national address, detailing measures to address Argentina's economic concerns.\n\nWhile Milei has not publicly spoken about digital assets since taking office, his appointment of Mondino and the inclusion of crypto-friendly provisions in the decree suggest a potential shift in Argentina's stance on cryptocurrencies.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "TP Icap's Duncan Trenholme spoke to DL News about how his clients are seeking out Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives.\n\nHe also spoke about trends in the industry, including soaring Bitcoin prices and the Binance settlement fallout.\n\nHe plans more hires for the digital assets unit amid more institutional interest in the sector.\n\nTP Icap\u2019s Duncan Trenholme got animated when speaking about a recent milestone in crypto \u2014 that he says went under the radar.\n\nEarlier this year, CME Group leapfrogged crypto-native exchange Binance to become the largest exchange for Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nIt happened even before US regulators slapped a $4.3 billion fine on Binance in November.\n\n\u201dThat was huge. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s talked about enough in general,\u201d said Trenholme, global co-head of digital assets at the world\u2019s largest inter-broker dealer.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cIt points to more traditional financial firms, more institutional firms, wholesale firms, coming into crypto.\u201d\n\nThis move could be the beginning of a trend Trenholme expects to develop in 2024 \u2014 as the hard border between traditional finance and crypto begins to blur.\n\nTP Icap, which matches buyers and sellers who trade more $1 trillion a day in a range of asset classes, has seen this first-hand.\n\nThere\u2019s been a steady flow of customers from across the firm\u2019s business that are eager to onboard and trade digital assets \u2014 including customers from fixed income and equities, global markets worth a combined $200 trillion.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nRecord monthly volume\n\nAnd the FTX scandal has helped lure traders from crypto-native firms, helping drive monthly volume at TP Icap to a record in October, Trenholme said in an interview at TP Icap\u2019s offices in London\u2019s Victoria area.\n\nOne big reason: \u201cPrice action that has been caused around Bitcoin, Bitcoin\u2019s run recently and I\u2019m sure, some of that is down to anticipation of the spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\u201d\n\nWhile trading slowed down in November, Trenholme says the firm has seen a boost in trading activity in wholesale regulated crypto asset derivatives for the last year and half.\n\n\u201cDecember has been more active than November for us on the derivatives side,\u201d said Trenholme, who started off in equity derivatives at the firm and moved to crypto in 2018.\n\nAnd in 2024, he sees more client interest coming for the crypto world as prices soar.\n\n\u201cWe expect more focus on over the counter derivatives, non-deliverable forwards, over-the-counter options\u201d he said.\n\nTwo big developments\n\nBitcoin\u2019s more than 150% surge this year has piqued curiosity from investors old and new.\n\nBut two big events in 2023 have been clutch.\n\nThis year saw the New York trade association dubbed ISDA, or the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, incorporate key terminology for digital assets.\n\nAnother big step, Trenholme noted, was the introduction of the first International Securities Identification Numbers for digital assets. ISIN numbers are prerequisites for clearing, reporting, and settlement of trades.\n\nBitcoin miners and Ethereum stakers\n\nThat has helped bring crypto into the fold of traditional trading structures, and has helped drive client demand, he said.\n\nHe sees increased interest in so-called hash-rate derivatives, financial instruments that offer volatility hedging for Bitcoin miners, as well as staking rate derivatives, that help with the interest clients earn when they stake Ethereum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more questions asked about those types of products,\u201d Trenholme said. \u201cWe expect there to be a continued trend of our traditional customers either coming back to the market or getting into the market for the first time. If the market continues to be more of a bullish nature, then that\u2019s only going to increase.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a trend that has been slowly but steadily gaining traction for about 18 months, he said, since the collapse of FTX and the US conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nThe FTX effect\n\nSince FTX, there has been a change in institutional investors\u2019 attitudes \u2014 a \u201cgeneral shift in volume moving off unregulated offshore platforms onto regulated entities in major financial jurisdictions,\u201d Trenholme said.\n\nAmong those also poised to cash in from this trend: Larry Fink, the boss of $9 trillion fund giant BlackRock, whose Bitcoin ETF is awaiting regulatory approval amid what he called a \u201cflight to quality\u201d in these trying times for crypto.\n\nHis line was echoed by CME Group\u2019s Giovanni Vicioso, who told DL News in November that the 125-year old Chicago derivatives exchange was able to jump above Binance thanks to punters seeking out regulated \u2014 and thus safer \u2014 alternatives.\n\nSuch a flight to safety following scandals, fines, and convictions in the industry this year has been a double edged sword.\n\nOn one hand, the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF from traditional fund giants including BlackRock and Fidelity has helped lift crypto prices, underpinning a new bull market.\n\nOn the other, crypto native firms may start to feel the pinch from an onslaught of regulated, compliance-savvy rivals.\n\nDid clients flee Binance after that bombshell settlement?\n\nIt\u2019s tricky to say, particularly because the flow data mostly comes from Binance, a private company that is not subject to public disclosure rules.\n\nThe industry, Trenholme says, has looked at the issue optimistically \u2014 as a hurdle that has been surmounted, and now everyone can move on.\n\nAnd CME inflows are a signal that next year will see more evolution, that will include more mainstream financial peers.\n\nMeanwhile, Trenholme says he sees a change in approach from big banks, which are thinking more \u201cexternally about the wider market,\u201d beyond secondary markets and financial market participants.\n\nHiring and expansion\n\nTrenholme and fellow global co-head of digital assets Simon Forster have been busy building their team, pulling talent with strong finance backgrounds.\n\nDigital assets product director Nithya Sridharan joined in September after almost a decade at Credit Suisse. And Hina Sattar, a former trader at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, joined in October as sales director of digital assets.\n\nHe said he\u2019s hiring \u201ca couple more\u201d for TP Icap\u2019s Fusion Digital Assets spot crypto-asset exchange.\n\nTrenholme said he\u2019s seen some leave crypto and go back to traditional markets, which is a good thing, \u201cbecause it brings people who are advocates for crypto back into financial services.\u201d\n\nWintermute explained a similar dynamic in October.\n\n\u201cOur team is growing,\u201d Trenholme said. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing a very organic pace, in line with our products maturing.\u201d\n\nDo you have a tip?

        "title": "What Is Cloud Mining of Cryptocurrency, and How Does It Work? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Cloud Mining?\n\nCloud mining is a mechanism to mine a cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, using rented cloud computing power without installing and directly running the hardware and related software. Cloud mining firms allow people to open an account and remotely participate in the process of cryptocurrency mining for a fee. This helps make mining accessible to a broader base of people because it reduces the need to purchase and maintain equipment or pay direct energy costs.\n\nCloud miners become participants in a mining pool, where users purchase a certain amount of \"hash power.\" Each participant earns a pro-rata share of the profits in proportion to the amount of hashing power rented.\n\nKey Takeaways Cloud mining involves mining for cryptocurrencies by leasing or purchasing mining equipment from a third-party mining provider responsible for maintaining the equipment.\n\nThe advantages of cloud mining are that it reduces the costs associated with mining and allows everyday investors who may lack the technical knowledge to mine cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe disadvantages of cloud mining are that the practice centralizes mining, and profits are reduced because they are shared.\n\nUnderstanding Cloud Mining\n\nCloud mining leverages cloud computing to produce blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Cloud computing, more generally, is one of the fastest-growing technology trends wherein computing services such as processing, server capacity, database services, software, and file storage are accessed via the cloud. Such companies charge on a usage basis, just like paying for water or electricity.\n\nMining is the backbone of some cryptocurrency blockchains, like Bitcoin. It is the process by which transactions are verified and added. It is also the means through which new coins are released. The combination of cloud mining and blockchain opens the world of crypto mining to people in distant locations with little or no technical knowledge or hardware infrastructure.\n\nAdvantages of Cloud Mining\n\nCloud mining relieves you of the financial burden of buying expensive equipment and maintaining it. You get to pass those costs on to the owner.\n\nEquipment owners and cloud mining hosts incur considerable upfront costs, so they use economies of scale to offset the expenses. Leasing equipment or hashrate gives them multiple sources of income. Calculated correctly, a cloud mining provider could break even and begin profiting in considerably less time than mining on their own.\n\nBy renting hash power from a mining farm, you get a share of the farm's overall profits without the costs.\n\nDisadvantages of Cloud Mining\n\nOne of the downfalls of cryptocurrency is that because some command such a high price, scams have become a common occurrence.\n\nThere is the prospect of diminishing profits because of increasing mining difficulty and more miners entering the networks to compete for earnings. Mining farms, where cloud mining usually takes place, have a dominant grip on cryptocurrency hashing power.\n\nThis dominance promotes the centralization of cryptocurrencies, which were intended to be decentralized financial systems.\n\nHow Cryptocurrency Cloud Mining Works\n\nMining for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, whether via the cloud or locally, does not actually involve any mining. While this process does generate new cryptocurrency tokens that are awarded to miners, the mining operation serves a much more crucial purpose for maintaining the security of a distributed ledger such as a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin mining is performed by high-powered computers that generate random numbers until a certain value is met. Once the value is guessed, the information contained in the block is validated by the network, a new block is opened, and the process starts all over. It is energy intensive because random numbers are generated over and over. For instance, on Dec. 23, 2023, the Bitcoin network generated more than 500 exahashes (500 quintillion guesses) per second, taking a little less than 10 minutes to open a new block.\n\nContrary to popular belief, mining does not solve \"complex computational math problems.\" Math is used in cryptographic hashing algorithms, such as SHA 256, but processors complete this within less than one second. Mining is a race\u2014whichever miner first guesses a value equal to or less than a number (the target) between zero and 2256 other combinations of letters and numbers wins. The lower the target, the more guesses that are needed.\n\nWhen cryptocurrency miners add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, part of their job is to verify that those transactions are accurate. This is accomplished by checking the hash of the closed block and ensuring it meets other criteria. If even one character in the information of a block was changed, the hash is different. The block is rejected if there is a difference.\n\nOne of the issues present in early blockchains was the ability to duplicate blocks, which allowed the same information to be used twice. This is something called \u201cdouble spending,\u201d which is using the same token for more than one transaction. Sending block information through a hashing function and requiring a majority of the network to agree that the resulting hash is valid prevents this from happening.\n\nDoes Cloud Mining Really Pay? Cloud mining can be profitable, depending on who provides your services. But, as with other types of mining, it is competitive, so there is no guarantee of payment or any continuity between payments.\n\nCan I Cloud Mine for Free? There are several free cloud mining service providers. However, as with everything that is \"free,\" you should use caution and do your own research\u2014don't rely on third parties to tell you about service providers. Many reviews are paid for by businesses and written by outsourced writers.\n\nWhich Cloud Mining Is Best? There are several cloud mining services available, and numerous reviews have been written. However, the best cloud mining service is the one that meets your financial circumstances, goals, and criteria for trustworthiness.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCloud mining is a service provided by businesses which own enough equipment and computational power to make mining more cost effective for people who don't have the means or knowledge to acquire and maintain mining equipment.\n\nFinding the right cloud mining service can be challenging because there are many legitimate ones, but scams are also very frequent in the cryptocurrency industry. It pays to do your own research and investigate whether the services you will be paying for will be provided and profitable.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "title": "The spot bitcoin ETF race could quickly reach your 401(k) retirement plan - CNBC",
        "content": "Paul Yeung | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nRight now, interest in bitcoin is high. The cryptocurrency is up over 150% this year after a dismal 2022, and the spot bitcoin ETF race has helped push its value higher. But it remains an extremely volatile asset class with as many enemies as true believers. Many major pension funds have earmarked dollars to crypto as an asset class in recent years. According to the 2022 CFA Institute Investor Trust Study, 94% of state and local pension plans had some crypto exposure. Fidelity Investments, the largest 401(k) plan administrator in the U.S., first added a bitcoin fund option in the fall of 2022 to allow employees who are comfortable with the risks and volatility of cryptocurrency to invest in bitcoin within their company-sponsored 401(k) plan. Here's what retirement savers who do see long-term potential in cryptocurrency as an asset class need to know about the potential use cases for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOptions to own crypto in retirement accounts are limited\n\nMany employers have been hesitant to offer crypto in a 401(k) based on 2022 guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, according to industry experts. With options to own crypto within retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs being limited, most people who own crypto today do so outside of retirement accounts. Many take a self-custody approach or use an exchange such as Coinbase or Gemini. Options are also available in nonretirement accounts at Fidelity and Betterment, for example. Accordingly, retirement savers seeking to hold crypto assets in a retirement account typically need to find a self-directed provider that allows crypto investments, and that list is also limited. Once spot bitcoin ETFs are approved, however, expect more providers to allow them, and more options for retirement savers to invest in this fashion, say industry experts.\n\nIf SEC approves over Department of Labor concerns, what happens next\n\nAssuming the SEC gives an affirmative nod to spot bitcoin ETFs, as expected, more companies might decide to offer it within their 401(k) lineup, said Steven T. Larsen, a certified financial planner and founder of Columbia Advisory Partners in Spokane, Washington. The question is how many. The Department of Labor doesn't prohibit crypto in company retirement plans, but in its March 2022 guidance, \"it put a pretty heavy thumb on the scale for plan sponsors considering it,\" said Joshua Rubin, vice president of legal at Betterment. \"At this early stage in the history of cryptocurrencies, the Department has serious concerns about the prudence of a fiduciary's decision to expose a 401(k) plan's participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies, or other products whose value is tied to cryptocurrencies,\" the Department of Labor wrote in a compliance assistance release.\n\nwatch now\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF may solve some of the hesitancies the DOL outlined, including concerns related to custody and recordkeeping and valuation, Rubin said. Still, employers may be hesitant to jump on board, at least initially, some industry watchers said. \"Employers will be very reticent about being the first ones out there to allow this,\" said Tim Picciott, a CFP with Lexington, Massachusetts-based Innovative Advisory Group. \"I don't see most HR departments and plan trustees just signing on. I think it's going to have to be a move from the workers\" asking for it, he said.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs likely to 'be everywhere'\n\nWhile market-leading custodians such as Schwab and Fidelity don't allow investors to invest directly in cryptocurrencies within individual retirement accounts, they have become more involved in the crypto market on multiple fronts, from venture investments both financial services giants made in a crypto trading infrastructure company to a thematic crypto fund launched by Schwab. But to invest directly, retirement investors need to work with other providers such as Bitcoin IRA, BitIRA and iTrustCapital. However, market watchers predict more mainstream custodians will offer spot bitcoin ETFs once they become available. \"It will be everywhere once these come out,\" said Larsen, who is also the founder of Defi Steward, which helps investment advisors manage digital assets for clients. \"This is great for people who want exposure to bitcoin as an asset class,\" he said.\n\nTax advantages for long-term crypto investors\n\nThere are a lot of factors that go into whether bitcoin has a place in your retirement portfolio. First and foremost, bitcoin is extremely volatile and many investors don't have the risk appetite to invest even a portion of their retirement dollars in this emerging asset class. Investors also need to consider whether they want to hold bitcoin directly in a self-directed IRA, or solo 401(k), if applicable, or invest in bitcoin through an ETF. With a spot bitcoin ETF, having a professional manager who is going to be diversifying access to crypto could lessen \u2014 though not eliminate \u2014 risk, said Mark Parthemer, chief wealth strategist at Glenmede, a wealth management firm.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nOn the other hand, there can be advantages to owning bitcoin directly through a self-directed IRA, Kline said. For instance, when it comes time to take your withdrawals after age 59\u00bd, you may be able to receive your distribution as the crypto asset itself, instead of taking the cash. When you sell the spot bitcoin ETF, the redemption would likely be for cash, he said. It's an approach the SEC regards as safer. In either case, there can be tax advantages for long-term investors who invest in crypto through a retirement account versus a brokerage account, Parthemer said. Assuming the investment increases dramatically, a retirement account allows investors to avoid the tax at the time of sale. If it's in a Roth IRA and you meet the holdings requirements, the withdrawals aren't subject to tax. By contrast, if you held it in a regular brokerage account and sold it, you could be subject to capital gains taxes at the time of sale, Parthemer said.\n\nOptions if your employer won't offer a spot bitcoin ETF\n\nIf your employer won't offer a spot bitcoin ETF in its 401(k) plan, you could always ask your employer to reconsider. If the answer is no, you can still open an IRA with a provider that makes spot bitcoin ETFs available. The new spot bitcoin ETFs will be eligible for use in all types of IRA accounts \u2014 deductible, nondeductible, Roth and SEP, as well as solo 401(k) plans, said Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Services, in an email."

        "title": "Bitcoin miners splash out $600mn in race to squeeze out rivals - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nCryptocurrency miners are spending heavily on the newest technology to earn more bitcoins, trying to gain market share and squeeze out rivals ahead of a halving of their rewards in around four months\u2019 time.\n\nMiners listed on the world\u2019s stock exchanges have this month committed to spending around $600mn on buying new chips and servers that are the keystone of the digital ledger underlying bitcoin, according to The Miner Mag, an industry data provider. The December amount is nearly half of the $1.3bn total committed for the year.\n\nThe burst of spending comes despite miners having suffered heavy losses in the 2022 crypto market crash. They are now trying to profit from the soaring price of bitcoin, which has surged to an 18-month high of more than $44,000.\n\nThe splurge also comes before a scheduled plan in April to halve the incentive scheme that verifies all bitcoin deals. Optimists hope the so-called \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a once every four year event to slow the circulation of bitcoins \u2014 will support further gains for the cryptocurrency next year but the move also threatens to undercut miners\u2019 shaky profitability.\n\n\u201cBuying equipment is not just an action in the bull market,\u201d said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at Foundry. Miners are \u201crealising that refreshing the fleet is what would keep them in business post-halving.\u201d\n\nMiners play a crucial role in bitcoin\u2019s operation, racing each other to verify new blocks of deals for its blockchain and taking on the role of deal guarantor. In return, the winner is rewarded with new tokens.\n\nHowever, the process has been heavily criticised for the huge carbon footprint it creates. According to Cambridge university, bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is today roughly equivalent to that of Poland or Malaysia.\n\nThe halving is expected to reshape industry economics, which have been deeply strained in the last two years by the high cost of energy and the falling price of coins. Now companies are spending big on new equipment, hoping to leave rivals on older machines struggling.\n\nNevada-based CleanSpark, a bitcoin mining firm that has committed roughly $280mn to mining equipment this year, is one prepared to accept a smaller financial reward in exchange for a larger slice of the market.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be dissimilar to when China banned mining [in 2021], everybody unplugged, and the percentage rewards skyrocketed for the miners that were still standing,\u201d said Matthew Schultz, executive chair at CleanSpark. \u201cThe companies that have made these investments [in new equipment] are likely the ones that survive,\u201d he added.\n\nBitcoin miners have already been pushed to their limits. Many invested during the bull run of 2020 and 2021, using debt and low interest rates to finance their expansion as the price of bitcoin soared to more than $69,000.\n\nHowever they were hit hard when bitcoin lost three-quarters of its value and energy prices soared. Companies including Core Scientific and Computer North filed for bankruptcy while others were forced to temporarily shut down operations or were paid by some US states not to mine bitcoin, in an effort to conserve energy.\n\nAnother, Marathon Digital, became a focus for short sellers after paying its former chief executive Merrick Okamoto just under $220mn in stock and missing its earnings targets.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rebound this year as market speculation intensifies that US regulators will approve a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nSupporters say approval would potentially unlock billions of dollars worth of capital from major Wall Street players like BlackRock and Fidelity and send the price of bitcoin much higher.\n\nEnthusiasts also note that the last halving, in May 2020, pushed bitcoin\u2019s price up by roughly 460 per cent over the subsequent 12 months.\n\nBitcoin miners share prices have responded to bitcoin\u2019s rising price: Riot Platforms is up 424 per cent this year and Marathon Digital is up 681 per cent. In Toronto, Bitfarms has risen 607 per cent this year and Hive Digital Technologies 232 per cent. In contrast, over the course of 2022 Riot and Marathon share prices fell by around 85 per cent and 90 per cent, respectively, while Bitfarms and Hive saw their share price decline by 91 per cent and 88 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe enthusiasm over the potential of a bitcoin ETF all of a sudden has opened up the ability to raise capital to upgrade equipment, so you\u2019ve seen this huge bulk buying spree,\u201d said Frank Holmes, executive chair of Hive, which itself committed $9mn to new equipment this month.\n\nBut hopes for a resurgence are still contingent on bitcoin\u2019s recent rally persisting. The SEC has given no indication it will approve an ETF, and end its decade-long policy of refusing all applications.\n\nMoreover miners are still plagued by real-world costs, notably energy.\n\nLatest figures pin the median cost to mine one bitcoin at around $17,000, but that could rise to as high as $34,000, according to The Miner Mag. It \u201cdoesn\u2019t leave much room\u201d for miners if bitcoin remains at its current price of roughly $42,000, said Wolfie Zhao, its head of research.\n\nBut some see it as a risk worth taking. Among them is Bitfarms, a Canadian-listed group, which this month set aside $95mn for new equipment.\n\n\u201cAs our market share goes up, and we get more bitcoins on a daily basis, our revenues and our cash flow should work out as well [as] if not better than in the status quo,\u201d said Geoffrey Morphy, Bitfarms chief executive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not maintaining [our market share], we\u2019re leapfrogging,\u201d he added."

        "title": "Crypto 2023 Review: What Happened in Crypto and Bitcoin in 2023 - The Hindu",
        "content": "December 22, 2023 02:39 pm | Updated 02:39 pm IST\n\nThere is far more to the world of crypto than just that day\u2019s price of Bitcoin. 2023 marked momentous shifts in the blockchain playing field as U.S. regulators brought tech billionaires to task while India became a major crypto adopter, setting the stage for what could be a 2024 filled with legal drama and strife.\n\nHere are just five compelling sagas which unfolded in the blockchain sector this year:\n\nThe FTX saga comes to a close (almost)\n\nThe FTX cryptocurrency exchange run by the eccentric, wild-haired billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, known for his luxurious lifestyle and multi-million dollar political donations, collapsed in November 2022. Almost a year later, the ex-CEO was convicted on seven criminal charges related to fraud and money laundering, as it was learned that FTX customer funds were misused to support a sister company called Alameda Research.\n\nDuring the legal proceedings that stretched through this year, Bankman-Fried\u2019s former colleagues, including a past romantic partner, testified that he knowingly broke laws and issued orders that hurt his customers. Bankman-Fried\u2019s court appearances during the trial were chaotic, he was jailed for witness tampering, and he presented himself as a businessman let down by his officials rather than as a malicious crypto criminal.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nHis sentencing is set for March 2024 and could lead to him spending decades in jail. Meanwhile, FTX debtors and liquidators in December agreed on a global settlement to help customers get back some of their assets.\n\nBinance\u2019s billionaire CEO steps down\n\nThe Chinese-born Canadian crypto tycoon and billionaire Changpeng Zhao was known as the head of Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Binance has in the past halted operations in several countries due to regulatory crackdowns, but this year saw the exchange agreeing to pay a massive settlement of roughly $4 billion to the U.S. government in late November for its illegal activities. In addition to this, Zhao pleaded guilty to a felony related to his failure to prevent money laundering on Binance, and stepped down as CEO.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Binance enabled more than 100,000 transactions violating U.S. sanctions, including ones linked to Hamas\u2019 al-Qassam Brigades, al-Qaeda, and even sexual abusers. The crypto exchange will be monitored as it is forced to formally exit the U.S. market.\n\nZhao\u2019s vocal influence in the sector is undeniable; his critical tweets about FTX\u2019s business practices in 2022 are credited with sparking the mass panic in which users all tried to pull out their funds from FTX, accelerating the exchange\u2019s collapse. Zhao\u2019s sentencing is due to take place in the U.S. next February.\n\nWorldcoin\u2019s formal launch\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was a controversial figure in the crypto community long before he became a major player in generative AI this year. His blockchain project, Worldcoin, aims to create a biometric database of the human population in exchange for giving them access to crypto and a digital ID which has been compared to India\u2019s Aadhaar number. The initiative was severely criticised by privacy advocates, including Edward Snowden, during its trial run in 2021. Altman this May raised $115 million for the project, whose crypto tokens are not available to U.S.-based users.\n\nAs OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT sparked off an AI boom and Altman flew around the world to discuss AI regulation with state leaders and top technologists, he formally launched Worldcoin. \u201cOperators\u201d across the world began collecting millions of iris scans by giving people the Worldcoin cryptocurrency in return. Worldcoin has also penetrated India, with \u201corb operators\u201d in cities such as Delhi and Bangalore encouraging people to get scanned. Activists in countries such as Indonesia have accused Worldcoin volunteers of coercing impoverished people to hand over their biometric data, without getting their informed consent.\n\nWorldcoin token prices fluctuated wildly in November this year as Altman was fired as the CEO of OpenAI, before getting hired by Microsoft and then being reinstated at OpenAI.\n\nIndia tops in grassroots adoption\n\n2023 was another year in which India\u2019s grassroots adoption of crypto raced far ahead of the legislation meant to regulate it, as blockchain analytics platform Chainalysis ranked the country first in its 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index released in October. Furthermore, India ranked second in terms of raw estimated crypto value received between July 2022 and June 2023, recording around $250 billion in crypto value in the past year. For comparison, the U.S. recorded roughly $1 trillion in crypto value during the same period.\n\nHowever, as grassroots crypto adoption grows, so does the number of scammers targeting victims who may not be familiar with blockchain technology. In the latter half of 2023, Indian authorities investigated the Solar Techno Alliance (STA) Ponzi scheme. The STA crypto scam may be one of India\u2019s largest so far, as it involved an amount of around \u20b91,000 crore and 2 lakh people, per the Odisha police.\n\nRise of Bitcoin\n\nFrom prices as low as below $17,000, Bitcoin [BTC] has made a slow but significant recovery as it moves towards the $45,000 mark, which it has not yet successfully touched this year. Geopolitical shocks such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 shook the sector badly, but 2023 has seen price consolidation and relative stability in what is a naturally volatile market. Bitcoin\u2019s rise has a similar effect on other top crypto coins and tokens, so several popular assets are on an upward trajectory. Out of the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin, more than 19 million BTC were in circulation as of late December.\n\nBitcoin is up by 161.26% in the past year, according to CoinMarketCap statistics, but crypto\u2019s largest coin by market capitalisation is far from its 2021 highs when it crossed $65,000 in price. Ethereum\u2019s Ether [ETH], the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up by 83.54% in the past year."

        "content": "Welcome to the merriest time of year, when loved ones may judge or praise you for your interest in Bitcoin (BTC) or simply ask, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\nEnlighten family and friends with solid arguments to convince your curious aunt or safeguard yourself from your brother-in-law, who just got his economics degree.\n\nIn this jolly exploration, we\u2019ll delve into the world of digital currency enlightenment and discover why Bitcoin maximalists are singing carols about the first cryptocurrency.\n\nKeep it light\n\nWhen a family member opens a window to speak about Bitcoin at the Christmas dinner table, you should consider who your audience is. Remember, the goal is not to force someone into accepting Bitcoin but to provide accurate information and allow them to make an informed decision.\n\nTailoring your approach to the individual or group\u2019s perspective and concerns can contribute to a more positive and constructive conversation.\n\nAs you may have experienced before, when asked about Bitcoin, you\u2019ll commonly find yourself in a defensive position and bombarded with skepticism. Recognize the conditions and don\u2019t erupt in passionate counterarguments; be patient and let the arguments do the talking.\n\nBeforehand, prepare some analogies and real-world use cases and rehearse your argument, as it is easy to get lost.\n\nStrong arguments for Bitcoin\n\nBefore you sit down at the Christmas dinner table, it may help to know some of the most convincing arguments for Bitcoin ahead of time:\n\nScarce supply: Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a scarce digital asset comparable to precious metals like gold. The scarcity contributes to its value proposition. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, minimizing the risk of government interference and censorship. This characteristic enhances its resilience as a global, borderless currency. Security: Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus mechanism ensures a high level of security, making it resistant to attacks and fraud. Store of value: The narrative of Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d positions it as a reliable store of value, particularly in times of economic uncertainty. Network effect: Bitcoin has the largest and most established network in the cryptocurrency space. This status contributes to its liquidity, recognition and overall strength. Censorship resistance: Bitcoin transactions are censorship-resistant, meaning that individuals can transact without fear of their funds being frozen or confiscated. This aligns with the principles of financial freedom and privacy. Hodler culture: The orange pill narrative embraces the hodler mentality, encouraging individuals to hold onto their Bitcoin for the long term rather than engaging in short-term trading. This strategy aligns with the belief in Bitcoin\u2019s future value appreciation. Halving events: Bitcoin undergoes halving events approximately every four years, reducing the rate of new coin creation. This scarcity mechanism is a bullish factor for Bitcoin\u2019s long-term value. Innovation and development: Ongoing development and innovation by the Bitcoin community, such as the Lightning Network, demonstrate the adaptability and potential for improvement within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Global adoption: Bitcoin\u2019s adoption is increasing internationally as a means of payment, store of value and investment. This trend is seen as a validation of Bitcoin\u2019s growing importance in the financial landscape.\n\nBitcoin: The next step in the evolution of money\n\nMoney has had many forms, with shells, salt and precious metals all serving as a medium of exchange. With the rise of empires, governments began issuing paper money, initially representing a claim on precious metals.\n\nThe world\u2019s reserve currency, the United States dollar, was initially backed by gold reserves until the transition to fiat currency in 1971. U.S. President Richard Nixon permanently detached money from the gold standard, granting a new form of money in which central financial authorities could rapidly increase the money supply.\n\nRecent: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children? The case for Bitcoin kids books\n\nBitcoin proponents claim that this loss of a hard standard has resulted in runaway inflation, with politicians either unwilling or unable to address the core issue.\n\nAmid the economic crisis of 2008, which saw unprecedented government bailouts for banks engaging in risky financial behavior, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto emerged. Like Santa on Christmas, this individual brought the gifts for the public in the form of a new evolution of money, Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin: Currency vs. store of value\n\nAs stated in the white paper, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Since its inception, Bitcoin has been interpreted in many different ways. Its creator intends it to be a digital currency exclusively for the people.\n\nHowever, Nakamoto\u2019s vision for BTC has yet to be fully realized. The Bitcoin blockchain can become overloaded with traffic as its usage increases, delaying transaction times and spiking fees. While Bitcoin can transfer massive wealth across borders at a fraction of the cost of the traditional financial system, in some cases, like paying for a coffee with BTC, it can be expensive due to network costs and slow due to confirmation times. Fortunately, Bitcoin is an ever-evolving network with a strong community of developers.\n\nThere is fierce debate within the community, but the final objective of the Bitcoin developers is to offer a trustable, functional and decentralized currency that can be used for payments. Many solutions have been proposed, including layer-2 solutions.\n\nThe Lightning Network (LN) is a second-layer scaling solution for blockchain networks, enabling faster and cheaper transactions by creating off-chain payment channels. Lightning performs all the computational operations of daily transactions in an independent network, which is connected to the main Bitcoin blockchain. As all operational computing is done in many pockets of independent networks, the transactions won\u2019t saturate the Bitcoin network. Once in a while, the LN would send the group of trades to the Bitcoin ledger in one transaction so they are registered. The LN can make BTC a software capable of managing daily payments, using the Bitcoin blockchain for all its positive properties without congesting the network.\n\nThere are many upsides to Bitcoin adoption. Anybody with a cheap smartphone and internet access, or even an SMS network, can use BTC.\n\nMicheal Saylor, the former CEO of MicroStrategy and an ardent Bitcoin proponent, considers BTC the perfect modern tool to hedge against inflation created by government-issued fiat currencies. In one of the best orange pill displays on the Tucker Carlson Show, Saylor highlighted the elephant in the room. For Saylor, the modern middle-class cash dependency forces them to work harder to get paid in a weaker currency in a never-ending cycle.\n\nThe potential for Bitcoin as an asset is massive. Due to all its engineered properties, the markets could see Bitcoin as the new digital gold. As an ideal inflation hedge, Bitcoin may shift the markets gradually as institutional investors step in. It could absorb part of gold\u2019s $12 trillion market cap, as well as the combined real estate and national currencies market caps of around $200 trillion.\n\nA positive collateral effect from this shift in the markets mentioned by Saylor would be the demonetization of utility markets as the monetization of Bitcoin becomes popular. Some speculative markets would eventually return to their original purpose. Real estate wouldn\u2019t be one of the first choices as a wealth preservation investment, and stocks would price in the actual value of a company instead of being investment vehicles to combat inflation or markets that absorb liquidity injections from money printing.\n\nBitcoin is digital property\n\nIn the future, Bitcoin may be a currency or the perfect store of value asset substituting gold. Around the globe, analysts are slowly but steadily grasping the deeper significance of Bitcoin: a digital property. And this may be the key feature.\n\nNobody has ever figured out how to transform money into digital property. Similar examples include the successful digitalization of photos, books, education, relationships and communications. These examples are the key to the success of Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, which monetized the ability to digitize specific sectors.\n\nBitcoin may have hit the bull\u2019s eye, monetizing capital property. Its functionalities provide individuals with a new form of property rights in the digital realm. Bitcoin offers individuals true ownership and control over their wealth without reliance on traditional financial institutions.\n\nSociety may have found something with integrity that gives people control over their lives in a world where there is a shared feeling life has gotten out of control. Santa, please pack some sats as presents.\n\nMagazine: Terrorism and Israel-Gaza war weaponized to destroy crypto"

        "title": "Analyst claims Bitcoin halving is \u2018all hype, no substance\u2019 \u2013 Is it? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Using fundamental data, the analyst noted that the 2024 halving might not be as impactful as the last ones.\n\nThe NVT Signal showed that BTC remains undervalued.\n\nThe effect of the Bitcoin [BTC] halving on the coin\u2019s price might be minimal, seasoned trader Peter Brandt noted in a recent post on X.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s opinion may have put a nail in the heart of BTC holders. But Brandt backed up his point with reasons. According to him, the Bitcoin halving might come with a lot of hype as expected.\n\nHe, however, mentioned that the reduction of supply would ensure that the impact on the BTC price is minimal. Brandt\u2019s opinion came as a surprise to some of his followers who questioned why he moved from his more familiar technical analysis to the fundamental side.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving hype is a whole lot of excitement over nothing\n\nSure, halving hype might temporarily impact price\n\nBut the reduction of supply as % of daily volume is the size of a gnat's ass pic.twitter.com/9JWRr12dkt \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 21, 2023\n\nA possible change in the effect\n\nThe analyst responded by saying that technical analysis does not stop him from evaluating demand and supply.\n\nFor many, Brandt\u2019s conclusion may not be valid. One reason for this is the historical BTC performance post-halving. For instance, after the November 2012 halving, Bitcoin went from $11 to $133 in 2013.\n\nThe 2016 having was not any different as BTC rose from $600 to over $4,000 months later. It was also in 2021 that the coin tapped an All-Time High (ATH) above $69,000.\n\nThis time, there is also widespread anticipation that the king coin would reach a new ATH after the 2024 halving.\n\nIn the last 365 days, BTC\u2019s value has increased by 159.22%, making up for the unfavorable market condition experienced in 2022.\n\nConsidering the current circumstances, AMBCrypto checked if the coin has the potential to increase even more. To do this, we considered the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Signal, provided by on-chain intelligence firm Glassnode.\n\nBTC is not at its top\n\nAt press time, the NVT signal had dropped to 85.40. The metric uses a 90-day moving average of the Bitcoin volume and transaction to identify market tops or bottoms.\n\nSince the NVT Signal fell from 102.33, it means BTC was not overheated.\n\nTherefore, it could be possible for the coin price to increase before 2023 ends. In the interim, many predictions are putting BTC in the $45,000 to $50,000 region before the year closes.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin halving is not the only catalyst capable of impacting the BTC price action next year. There is also the potential spot ETF approval.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nIf the U.S. SEC approves one of the many ETF applications by January 2024, many believe that it would open the door for a flow of institutional capital into Bitcoin.\n\nThis could also influence a surge in the BTC price. So, irrespective of the halving influence, there is a chance for BTC to hit a new high before the four-year event. Whether Brandt\u2019s opinion would come to pass or not, time would tell."
