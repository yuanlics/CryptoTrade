        "title": "Cryptocurrencies rise, sending bitcoin over $30,000 at one point, on optimism for a new ETF - CNBC",
        "content": "At one point Monday morning, bitcoin surged above $30,000 in a sudden spike on an unconfirmed report that the iShares spot bitcoin ETF had been formally approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the coin quickly gave up those gains as that report was unable to be confirmed by major media. BlackRock told CNBC the iShares Bitcoin ETP application is still under review by the SEC. Sources close to the SEC said that Monday's report was not accurate.\n\nCryptocurrencies jumped to start the week as hopeful investors weighed the likelihood that the U.S. will finally see a bitcoin ETF in the coming months.\n\nIn recent trading, bitcoin rose about 5.28% to $28,454.17, according to Coin Metrics, while ether added 1.86% to trade at $1,589.10.\n\nLast week, bitcoin had jumped on Friday on news that the SEC would not appeal a ruling in Grayscale's lawsuit against regulators. In June of 2022, Grayscale sued the SEC over its denial of the company's application to convert the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\n\"The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure's 45-day period to seek rehearing has now passed. The Court will now issue its final mandate within seven calendar days,\" a Grayscale spokeswoman told CNBC. \"The Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC's approval, and we look forward to sharing more information as soon as practicable.\"\n\nIt's possible the SEC could again deny Grayscale's request, but the commission has recently been losing momentum in its attempt to broadly regulate crypto, with Grayscale in particular proving an obstacle. For example, the D.C. Court of Appeals called the SEC's denial \"arbitrary and capricious.\" Many investors read Friday's news as a signal that the SEC could be close to allowing Grayscale to list GBTC shares.\n\n\"Many people think the fact that the SEC chose to ask questions is a change of behavior and therefore I do think hopes are rising that a or a number of bitcoin ETFs will be approved,\" Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" Monday.\n\nTo be sure, bitcoin is coming off its worst week since Aug. 18 and first negative week in six. It lost 4.35% for the week, closing at $26,755.66, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost 6.36% for the week and ended the week at $1,544.24.\n\nBitcoin and ether may also be benefiting from worries about a recession, which has Paul Tudor Jones last week to Bernstein this morning touting bitcoin as a safe haven trade in an uncertain macroeconomy.\n\nStill, the price of bitcoin is under some pressure as the regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. crypto industry has investors apathetic about boosting their positions. As a result, the market has been plagued by low volume and liquidity and bitcoin has been unable to reach new highs above $30,000.\n\nThe optimism Monday morning lifted other crypto assets. Ripple's XRP and Binance Coin , the top coins by market cap behind bitcoin and ether excluding stablecoins, were higher by 1.77% and 2.42%, respectively. Smart contracts platform Solana's sol token was up 9% and Polygon's matic token added 2.8%.\n\nCrypto equities, which have also struggled recently, are outperforming crypto assets. On Monday morning Coinbase was higher by more than 2% in early trading. Mining stocks including Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital , were up about 5% across the board.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Jesse Pound, Nick Wells and John Melloy contributed reporting.\n\nDon't miss these CNBC PRO stories:"

        "title": "Cryptocurrency price collapse leads Texas bitcoin mine developer to target battery storage opportunity - Energy-Storage.news",
        "content": "However, Bootstrap instead wants to replace the proposed second phase with a large-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) facility.\n\nThe developer had received zoning approval for siting its crypto mine on the land in mid-2022, but with the proviso that it be allowed to consider and put forward plans for alternative industrial uses. The City Council of Corpus Christi last week (10 October) approved its \u201cchange of focus\u201d at a meeting, as well as revised execution timelines.\n\nTeaming up with Leyline Renewable Energy-backed battery storage developer Navitas Energy, Bootstrap said its BESS is expected to be connected to the ERCOT power grid and go into service \u201cnot later than the end of calendar year 2025\u201d.\n\nThe company has been \u201cproceeding diligently\u201d in preparation for its alternative plan, including filing an interconnection request with ERCOT, according to a letter sent to the council in August by Bootstrap Energy chief operating officer Matthew Held.\n\nThe developers expect the full interconnection study to be completed next month by utility AEP, which owns the existing substation to which the BESS would be connected.\n\nNavitas bought a 50.1% stake in the BESS portion of the development in February and is currently designing the project to feature a 300MW battery storage system.\n\n\u2018Crypto winter\u2019 price collapse\n\nBootstrap Energy is going ahead with the initial 300MW of cryptocurrency mining, but said that factors including the high profile fall of the FTX crypto exchange had precipitated a dramatic reduction in demand for mining.\n\nFTX\u2019s collapse and subsequent jailing of CEO Sam Bankman-Fried came during what was already being referred to as a \u2018crypto winter\u2019 \u2013 a period when crypto prices become severely depressed, disrupting infrastructure investments in the sector.\n\nBootstrap noted in a presentation to the Corpus Christi council that when it signed an offtake deal in February 2022 for the first phase, the price of bitcoin (BTC) was US$44,000, but by September 2022, it had fallen to US$18,000. At that time, offtaker Computer North filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and four months later FTX collapsed, bringing the BTC price down to just US$15,000.\n\nThen, the customer for Phase 2 backed out of the project \u201cjust days before expected closing,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe good news was that energy storage is seen as a new opportunity and Bootstrap Energy was approached by \u201cnumerous energy storage developers\u201d before brokering the deal with Navitas Energy and becoming its joint developers.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, ERCOT accounted for 70% of all large-scale BESS deployments in the US. From around 3.3GW of batteries on the grid as of this summer, there are forecast to be 9.5GW connected by the end of 2024.\n\nThe two parties are both focused on Texas\u2019 fast-growing market and developing numerous other BESS sites as well as some gas generation, all scheduled to be financed and constructed in a 2024-2026 timeline.\n\nBootstrap said the Phase 2 development would represent around a US$100 million investment and noted that the longer depreciation period for BESS versus crypto means capital equipment replenishment will be needed every 10 years as opposed to every five as originally proposed to the city.\n\nIt also pointed out the availability of \u201cmassive\u201d investment tax credit (ITC) incentives available for energy storage developments, as introduced with the passing of the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August last year.\n\nPhase 1 will still go ahead as a bitcoin mine. Each of the two phases will be worth around an equal amount in payments to Corpus Christi\u2019s general fund, an average of around US$1.6 million a year, Bootstrap said.\n\nIn April 2022, a bitcoin mining and services company, Blockstream Mining, began work on a proof of concept (POC) project to compute the currency using a 3.8MW solar PV array paired with 12MWh of Tesla Megapack BESS units. That POC is sited at an undisclosed US location, as reported by Energy-Storage.news last year.\n\nOur publisher Solar Media is hosting the 10th Solar and Storage Finance USA conference, 7-8 November 2023 at the New Yorker Hotel, New York. Topics ranging from the Inflation Reduction Act to optimising asset revenues, the financing landscape in 2023 and much more will be discussed. See the official site for more details."

        "content": "Bitcoin soared but then pared back gains following a now-debunked rumor that the first amid a flurry of applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF had been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe cryptocurrency jumped 5.6%, to as high as $29,483, following the rumor published Monday morning, according to CoinGecko. It stopped just short of the $30,000 level, which Bitcoin hasn\u2019t reached since August, but was still up about 4.9%, at $28,200, just before noon.\n\nThe rumor, spurred by a now-deleted post on X by CoinTelegraph, claimed that the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s iShares spot Bitcoin ETF, which the asset manager filed in June. BlackRock\u2019s filing led to a wave of copycats, including WisdomTree, Invesco, and Fidelity, which all submitted or updated existing spot Bitcoin ETF filings. The new rush of filings was widely seen as a boon for the crypto space that could lead to an increase in investor funds in the sector.\n\nWhile some analysts have said odds are that the first spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved by the end of the year, the SEC has made no such promises. The agency lost a case earlier this year against Grayscale in which the court found that its refusal to grant Grayscale a Bitcoin ETF was without basis. A spot Bitcoin ETF has yet to be approved in the U.S.\n\nBloomberg reported on Friday that the SEC would not appeal the Grayscale decision, which makes it more likely, although not guaranteed, that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved sooner rather than later.\n\nCoinTelegraph said in an updated X post on Monday that it was investigating what led to the incorrect tweet about BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF."

        "title": "Fight to launch spot bitcoin ETF in the US passes another hurdle - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe long-running fight to launch a US exchange traded fund investing directly in bitcoin has passed another hurdle after the regulator declined to contest a court ruling made against it.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission had until Friday to appeal against an August federal appeals court ruling that it had been wrong to reject an application from cryptocurrency house Grayscale Investments to convert its $16.7bn Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world largest crypto fund, into an ETF.\n\nJudge Neomi Rao, writing for a three-judge panel, said the SEC had been \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in failing to explain why it had rejected applications for \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin ETFs \u2014 which invest directly in the digital token \u2014 while giving the green light to ETFs trading in bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nInvestors reacted to the deadline passing for an SEC appeal by cutting GBTC\u2019s discount to net asset value to about 14 per cent, according to Bloomberg, its narrowest margin since November 2021, having hit a record 48.9 per cent in December 2022. Bitcoin rose 3.7 per cent to $27,757 between Friday and noon UK time on Monday on the news, before spiking above $28,000 on unfounded reports that a rival BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF had been approved, a rumour later denied by both BlackRock and the SEC.\n\nGiven that the discount is expected to disappear entirely if the private trust is able to convert into an ETF, it is widely perceived as a barometer of investors\u2019 expectations.\n\nTodd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy said the SEC\u2019s decision not to appeal suggested the future launch of spot bitcoin ETF looked more likely.\n\n\u201cCombined with the regulator\u2019s ongoing interactions with other asset managers seeking to launch a spot bitcoin ETF is a sign that a US spot bitcoin ETF is more likely to come to market in the near future. We could see new products trading in early 2024 after years of the SEC rejecting such plans.\u201d\n\nGrayscale said it \u201cremains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC\u2019s approval\u201d.\n\nThe regulator had based its opposition to GBTC\u2019s conversion on a view that bitcoin, which trades on unregulated exchanges, is prone to fraud and market manipulation, whereas bitcoin futures were an acceptable asset for a mainstream retail fund because they traded on regulated venues such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision not to appeal against the ruling now leaves it with the option of opposing GBTC\u2019s conversion on alternative grounds or ultimately approving it, which would seemingly open the floodgates to a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAlongside Grayscale, 10 other managers, including BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, Fidelity, Ark Invest, WisdomTree, VanEck and Valkyrie, have outstanding filings in place to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSeveral of these applicants have amended their filings in recent days to say that their assets would be held in segregated accounts by their custodian and not commingled with either corporate or other customer assets.\n\nThe list of risk factors has also been extended in many cases. Ark, for instance, in its joint filing with 21Shares now refers to \u201cthe actual or perceived use of bitcoin and other digital assets in illicit transactions, which may adversely affect the bitcoin industry and an investment in the trust\u201d.\n\nIt further says that \u201cdigital asset mining operations can consume significant amounts of electricity, which may have a negative environmental impact and give rise to public opinion against allowing, or government regulations restricting, the use of electricity for mining operations\u201d.\n\nThe fact that many of the applicants have adopted additional wording has given rise to speculation that the SEC is actively engaging with them rather than planning to reject the filings outright, as it has done with every application for the past decade.\n\nBradley Duke, chief strategist at ETC Group, a provider of crypto exchange traded products, said that while it was possible the SEC might find another reason to oppose spot bitcoin ETFs \u201cit\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for them to do that\u201d.\n\n\u201cMore and more of the largest American financial services firms are opening up some sort of bitcoin or crypto-backed business,\u201d Duke said, mentioning the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity and Charles Schwab.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling of inevitability around crypto and a spot bitcoin ETF in the US,\u201d he added, with Patrick McHenry, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, last month criticising the SEC\u2019s \u201ccrusade against the digital assets ecosystem\u201d, which he argued had caused \u201clasting damage\u201d.\n\nSimilar exchange traded products already exist in Canada and Europe, where their advent has so far proved uncontentious.\n\n\u201cWe have had the equivalent of spot bitcoin ETFs in Europe for many years and they have traded well and efficiently with no problems,\u201d Duke added.\n\nRosenbluth believed the SEC would be likely to follow the pattern it set with this month\u2019s rollout of futures-based ETFs investing in ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, when it created a level playing field by allowing several ETFs to list on the same day, \u201crather than giving one firm a first-mover advantage,\u201d as it did with the ProShares Bitcoin Trust (BITO), the first US futures-based bitcoin ETF to launch in October 2021.\n\nArk and the SEC both declined to comment.\n\nThe advent of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US would be seen as potentially opening the way for greater mainstream investment in the cryptocurrency industry, given ETFs\u2019 status as a cheap, safe and well-understood regulatory wrapper.\n\nRegistered investment advisers, which are typically only permitted to invest in listed, regulated assets, would also have access to spot crypto for client portfolios for the first time."

SEC most likely didn\u2019t come about because Chair Gary Gensler had a change of heart. Instead, the reason for the SEC folding its cards probably lies in the fact that its legal resources are already stretched thin in light of Gensler\u2019s campaign against crypto\u2014and because the three judges in the case totally shredded the SEC\u2019s rationale for denying the ETF in the first place.\n\nThe upshot is that a long-awaited Bitcoin ETF is coming to U.S. shores sooner than later, and that an Ethereum one will likely arrive not long after that. What is less clear is which company will offer it and what this development will mean for long-slumping crypto markets.\n\nAs Fortune has reported in detail, Grayscale has been the face of the legal fight to push the SEC to green-light a Bitcoin ETF, a type of fund that\u2019s been available for years in Europe and Canada. But as the court proceedings began to look more favorable for Grayscale, some of the biggest names in finance\u2014most notably BlackRock and Fidelity\u2014filed applications to offer one, too. Given that it would be safer in terms of optics for the SEC to give the prize to a familiar name from traditional finance, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if Gensler processes the applications in a way that lets a company like BlackRock go first.\n\nThe more intriguing question, though, is the second one\u2014what a long-awaited ETF means for the crypto markets. For years, the crypto industry has hyped the impending arrival of institutional money as a game changer that will turbocharge the markets by bringing in billions of dollars of new capital and drive up prices. I think there is something to this argument and, in the context of the impending ETF, it\u2019s easy to imagine giant asset managers nudging their numerous clients to add a small slice of Bitcoin to their portfolios.\n\nA troubling thought for the industry, though, is what if this doesn\u2019t happen? What if the door to institutional money finally swings open but few people choose to walk through it? For months now, crypto prices have scuffled along at respectable levels\u2014Bitcoin is up 75% since the start of the year\u2014but volumes have dropped to levels not seen in years. This has created the impression that crypto is pass\u00e9 and shaken the confidence of some in the industry. A big ETF-fueled price rally would turn this narrative around in a hurry and provide some much-needed enthusiasm\u2014but if no rally materializes, the pressure will only grow for the crypto industry to prove that current conditions are about to change.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nAn investigation of Garantex reveals the Russian crypto exchange has, despite U.S. sanctions, expanded to become a big player in cross-border finance where it specializes in ruble-Tether transactions.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When Bitcoin development company Lightning Labs first launched the Lightning Network in 2018, it was all the rage. The protocol, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, was designed to make cryptocurrency transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAt the time, Lightning Labs had raised $2.5 million of seed financing from investors including Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey and PayPal\u2019s David Sacks, who dubbed it \u201cthe most important protocol being built on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBut soon after launching, murmurs of failed transactions on the Lightning Network began popping up on X, and suddenly, the next big thing for Bitcoin seemed anything but. Users reported liquidity issues and security vulnerabilities, creating a perception that the Lightning Network was an over-complicated, unreliable protocol.\n\nRead More: The \u2018Blockchain Trilemma\u2019 That\u2019s Holding Back Crypto: QuickTake\n\nAs the volume of activity on Bitcoin increases, transactions can become slower and costlier. The reason Bitcoin transactions take a while to process is the underlying technology, which ensures decentralization and security by recording each transaction on an encrypted chain.\n\nThe demand for so-called \u201cLayer-2\u201d scaling solutions like Lightning Network has only grown, but those for Bitcoin in particular, have struggled with capital constraints. About 99% of venture capital investments over the past few years flowed into other crypto products, not Bitcoin, according to a 2022 report by Trammell Venture Partners. Since its inception, Lightning Labs has raised $82.5 million in funding compared with one of Ethereum\u2019s leading Layer-2 solutions, Polygon, which brought around $450 million in its latest funding round.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhen the Bitcoin scaling wars were happening from 2015 to 2017, it was decided that Lightning Network was going to be the layered approach that Bitcoin would pursue,\u201d Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, said in an interview. \u201cBut Bitcoin itself is a very difficult protocol to change. And whenever there has been change, it\u2019s been highly contentious.\u201d\n\nRead More: Technology Meant to Make Bitcoin Money Again Goes Live\n\nOn the Rise Again\n\nThe protocol was first proposed by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon in 2015 as a solution to Bitcoin\u2019s scaling limitations. While traditional digital payment companies like Visa can process around 24,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin can only process seven. Lightning Network seemed to be on the path to change that.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Bitcoin has not been the place where venture capitalists tend to be focused,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThe Bitcoin space is very ideological, and a lot of Bitcoiners have a negative view of venture capital.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, two of the largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, announced their integration with Lightning Network, joining companies like Lightspark, a crypto startup which works on Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, and digital payments firm Strike.\n\nAlthough Coinbase was eying Lightning Network \u201cfor a long time,\u201d the technology only recently reached a place the exchange company felt \u201ca lot better about,\u201d Viktor Bunin, who leads the Protocol Operations team at Coinbase, said in a recent interview on the Galaxy Brains podcast.\n\n\u201cFor many years Lighting has been quite challenging to use and run,\u201d Bunin continued. \u201cThe non-custodial experience is still severely lacking relative to the custodial experience.\u201d\n\nBut, as a company that is \u201cunequivocally pro-Bitcoin,\u201d Bunin adds, Lightning Network\u2019s eventual integration only made sense for Coinbase.\n\nLightning Labs and Binance did not respond to a request for comment. Coinbase declined to comment.\n\nBitcoin rose about 2% to $27,760 on Monday in New York. That\u2019s less than half the record high of almost $69,000 reached in November 2021.\n\n\u2018An Integral Step\u2019\n\nLast year, Lightning Labs announced the creation of Taproot Assets, formerly known as Taro, a protocol that allows users to instantly transfer other digital currencies, like stablecoin and nonfungible tokens, on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nChristopher Calicott, managing director of Trammell Venture Partners, said Taproot Assets is an integral step to Lightning Network\u2019s development, as wider adoption is one of the primary obstacles the Layer-2 solution faces. A 2022 report by Arcane Research said that more than 80 million people have access to Lightning Network.\n\nWhile Lightning Network theoretically has the capability to support one million transactions per second, its ability to reach that potential is dependent on its wide-scale usability. And as a peer-to-peer network, it\u2019s difficult to gage how many transactions are happening at any given point, according to Graham Krizek, the founder & CEO of Voltage, a Lightning as a Service (LaaS) provider.\n\nRead More: Valor, Brevan Howard Back Lightning to \u2018Bitcoinize the Dollar\u2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask everyone that\u2019s using Lightning Network how many transactions they are doing, how frequently, all of those things to really calculate it,\u201d Krizek said.\n\nHis company Voltage was established in 2020 after he found Lightning Network difficult to understand and use, even as a developer. But compared to Lightning Network\u2019s early days, Krizek said he\u2019s optimistic about its future.\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s a whole ecosystem, where you can use Lightning for not only depositing and withdrawing from Binance, but also in social networks or even traditional finance,\u201d Krizek said. \u201cThere are a lot of more applications to it now and will continue to be, particularly in back end systems.\u201d\n\nSome, like Carter, remain skeptical of the Layer-2 solution\u2019s ability to transform even Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very high mental cost involved in learning to use the Lightning protocol yourself,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBut as a different payment technology for digitally native content, I think that\u2019s where it\u2019ll find its niche.\u201d\n\n(Updates to add the price of Bitcoin.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

        "content": "Investors who want to bet on Bitcoin may soon have more options to choose from. Major financial firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco have submitted applications to sell US \u201cspot\u201d exchange-traded funds tied directly to Bitcoin holdings, and Grayscale Investments LLC won an Aug. 29 court ruling in its push to turn its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. In the past, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has routinely rejected these products, citing wariness over volatility and potential manipulation. But the Grayscale ruling and the BlackRock filing, in particular, might show the cryptocurrencies industry gaining the upper hand.\n\n1. What do Bitcoin ETFs look like?\n\nETFs, a $7 trillion industry, are part of a broader family of products known as exchange-traded products, though people frequently use \u201cETFs\u201d to refer to all of them since they are by far the largest and most popular category. Crypto-native firms and major Wall Street financial institutions alike are trying to launch a kind of ETF that actually holds Bitcoin, as opposed to the products that invest in Bitcoin futures. Futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs have been available to US customers since 2021, but the SEC hasn\u2019t approved any applications for so-called spot Bitcoin ETFs. Issuers and investors are advocating for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be similarly accessible to retail and institutional investors in the US, a development that\u2019s perceived as having the potential to greatly broaden participation in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. What\u2019s the difference between Bitcoin futures and spot Bitcoin?\n\nFutures are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specified price at a later date. They are widely used in many markets, like oil, by investors who want to speculate on price movements without having to own or take possession of the underlying asset directly. As the price of Bitcoin swings up or down according to direct trading, Bitcoin futures track the cryptocurrency\u2019s spot price indirectly on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In the spot Bitcoin market, by contrast, users buy and sell the actual digital currency via exchanges.\n\n3. What\u2019s been available before now?\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF became the first Bitcoin futures ETF available in the US, opening on Oct. 19, 2021, to strong demand. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (ticker BTCC) made its debut in Toronto in early 2021; it invests directly in \u201cphysical/digital Bitcoin,\u201d according to its issuer, Purpose Investments Inc. In June, issuer Volatility Shares launched a leveraged Bitcoin-futures ETF. Multiple Ether-futures funds debuted in October. Meanwhile, several US investment trusts have been following Bitcoin in a manner that\u2019s similar to ETFs but with certain restrictions. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker GBTC) is physically backed, meaning that it holds Bitcoin. Grayscale sued the SEC over its attempt to turn GBTC into an ETF; that\u2019s the case in which Grayscale won a key legal fight in August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Where do things stand?\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest asset manager, BlackRock Inc., filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, kicking into high gear speculation that the long-illusive investment product would finally get SEC approval. BlackRock\u2019s application, in turn, led to a major crypto market rally and a flurry of similar ETF applications and resubmissions from issuers including Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree Inc. Grayscale has been making the argument that a conversion would help it unlock billions of dollars in value for investors of GBTC. The SEC isn\u2019t asking planning a federal appeals court to reconsider the ruling and isn\u2019t going to lob any other appeals in the case. That brings further clarity to how the process of Grayscale potentially converting its trust to an ETF may unfold, though the road ahead could still be long and drawn out.\n\n5. Why did regulators shun a Bitcoin ETF for so long?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to their worries about liquidity and manipulation, regulators have expressed concern that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility might be too intense for ordinary investors \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s last three full-year returns were gains of 305% in 2020, up another 60% in 2021, followed by a loss of 64% in 2022. The SEC has also questioned whether funds would have the information necessary to adequately value tokens like Bitcoin, including whether they can validate who owns the underlying coins. In 2021, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler testified to the Senate Banking Committee that the lack of regulatory oversight and surveillance in crypto markets led to \u201cconcerns about the potential for fraud and manipulation.\u201d In an attempt to allay some of the SEC\u2019s concerns, BlackRock and other issuers following in its footsteps have proposed so-called surveillance-sharing agreements, a way to mitigate the risk of market manipulation and fraud. Coinbase Inc., the only publicly traded, pure-play spot-crypto exchange in the US, has emerged as ETF issuers\u2019 market surveillance partner of choice.\n\n6. What might the SEC\u2019s process look like?\n\nSome experts are expecting an ultimate approval of at least one spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the year, while others advise caution, as the battlefield is already littered with corpses of around 30 prior attempts that failed to persuade the SEC to give them a chance. Analysts will now also be closely watching any potential developments in Grayscale\u2019s conversion process. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts see the conversion as \u201cinevitable\u201d and expect open dialog between regulators and the asset-manager going forward.\n\n--With assistance from Claire Ballentine.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com"

        "title": "A Bitcoin ETF is coming to the US. Here's what to expect when that happens - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Since its inception 15 years ago this month, Bitcoin has become the star around which the rest of the blockchain industry revolves. It remains the most widely known and best-understood project in the broader crypto ecosystem, and it continues to galvanize interest in digital currencies across the world.\n\nOne thing that unites all Bitcoin holders is trust in unchangeable code. Every day, the network\u2019s miners convert real-world energy into a scarce digital asset that exists on an immutable public ledger. But one place where this trust has yet to take hold is traditional finance, where many big players are unwilling to hold Bitcoin outside of a familiar investment instrument.\n\nThere are any number of reasons for this state of affairs. Though the process of buying, storing, managing and transferring Bitcoin has gotten much simpler, it\u2019s still easy to misplace private keys or send Bitcoin to the wrong address \u2014 to say nothing of persistent concerns regarding its regulatory prospects. Ultimately, what this means is that traders operating within institutions beholden to restrictive investment rules have effectively been locked out of a promising and potentially highly profitable new arena.\n\nThe most obvious solution to this problem would be an exchange-traded fund specializing in Bitcoin. An ETF is a basket of investments that can be traded on a stock exchange. A spot Bitcoin ETF, therefore, is effectively the same thing as making Bitcoin tradeable on such an exchange. While self-custody is preferable for some folks, this would furnish a straightforward way for other investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without needing to directly manage it themselves.\n\nAbsent an ETF, investors \u2014 particularly institutions that aren\u2019t allowed to own Bitcoin directly \u2014 are limited to instruments like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. While GBTC indirectly grants exposure to Bitcoin, it doesn\u2019t allow for immediate redemptions. This means that at various times it has traded at either sizable premiums or sizable discounts to Bitcoin, leading to incredibly inefficient cryptoasset markets. An ETF would allow many more investors to get direct exposure to Bitcoin, including major institutions that will bring an air of legitimacy to the broader digital asset space.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow close are we to a Bitcoin ETF in the United States? The short answer is: much closer than we were even a few months ago. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. recently sided with Grayscale in its attempt to overrule the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s denial of their earlier request to establish a Bitcoin ETF. A few months before that the largest asset management company in the world, BlackRock, submitted its own proposal for a Bitcoin ETF, with many other blue-chip institutions following suit. Outside of the U.S., recent efforts in this direction have included the introduction of Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF, along with multiple successful approvals of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada over the past two years.\n\nIn addition to various other legal and economic justifications, global analysts offer these two examples as proof of the inevitability of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. JPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou recently stated that the SEC would either be forced to approve GBTC\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs or would have to suffer the embarrassment of retroactively withdrawing a prior approval of similar ETFs based on futures contracts. Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart, in addition, predicted that spot Bitcoin ETF approvals would be a \u201cdone deal\u201d by 2024.\n\nAt this point, the destination is inevitable; how much longer it takes to get there remains to be seen.\n\nAs for the question of \u201cwhy now,\u201d two core reasons stand out as especially important. First, in a world marked by a growing distrust of authority, Bitcoin represents a comforting mathematical certainty. A core tenet of Bitcoin is that its supply is capped at 21 million, making it one of the only assets whose supply is completely unaffected by demand. Given that increasing Bitcoin\u2019s supply ahead of its pre-programmed emissions schedule is impossible, the only way to address an increase in demand is to make it more accessible with instruments like ETFs.\n\nThe second reason stems from the fact that more and more people are building on top of the underlying Bitcoin network. Earlier this year, NFTs and fungible tokens were introduced to the Bitcoin blockchain, causing demand for network capacity to skyrocket. Though we\u2019re no doubt in the early stages of these developments, they are nevertheless glimpses into a future where Bitcoin contributes to the governance of complex systems with uniquely credible neutrality.\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is now attempting to gain access to the traditional financial system, but there is the intriguing possibility that it will compete with that system in a much more fundamental way. Rather than an ETF being a basket through which investors hold Bitcoin, for example, \u201ctokenization\u201d \u2014 the issuance of scarce digital tokens representing shares of ownership \u2014 could eventually be the means by which traditional assets are held in a decentralized way. This would increase transparency and available liquidity while simultaneously reducing the prevalence of fee-extracting intermediaries.\n\nAs an asset, Bitcoin is only the beginning. Its second-order effects will be truly vast."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly jumped on a report that BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF had been approved. It's a report that BlackRock denies, saying it's application is still being reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan tells Yahoo Finance Live that the \"tea leaves are pointing toward a potential approval.\" \"The SEC has previously been worried about market manipulation, about a lack of maturity in the market, but the bitcoin market of today is not the bitcoin market of a few years ago. It's an institutional market, with institutional players, and institutional custody,\" Hougan says. Watch the video above to find out what date Hougan says investors should be watching to find out if a spot bitcoin ETF is approved.\n\nClick here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, Bitcoin is among the big movers on Wall Street today. Crypto has been seeing wild swings as investors wait on a decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs. There was a report early on in the day that the SEC had approved the iShares ETF. Bitcoin spiked on that news but pared those gains after BlackRock said the fund was still under review.\n\nJoining us now, Matt Hougan, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer. He's got his hat in the ring as well with these offerings. And everybody's been waiting to see if approval was going to come, Matt. What are you guys hearing? Any kind of glimmer of news from the SEC? And what do you think is the hold out here?\n\nMATT HOUGAN: Yeah. Well, thanks for having me on. Of course, I can't speak to Bitwise's filing or any specific filing. But I do think the tea leaves are pointing toward a potential approval. You know, we have major issuers like BlackRock, coming into the market, saying we're ready for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Firms like Bitwise who have been doing this for years have submitted additional research into this space.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think the time is right for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC has previously been worried about market manipulation, about a lack of maturity in the market. But the Bitcoin market of today is not the Bitcoin market of a few years ago. It's an institutional market with institutional players and institutional custody. And we're ready for an ETF that will make it cheaper and safer for Americans to invest in this exciting asset class.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So Matt, when do you think-- and I realize, listen, you're reading tea leaves here, but when do you think the SEC could approve that spot Bitcoin ETF, Matt? Are you thinking, you know, by year-end? And when they do, Matt, do you think they should the SEC should approve all the Bitcoin ETFs here at once?\n\nMATT HOUGAN: Yeah. So the way this works is there's a calendar based system for every ETF that is applied for. And the date I would circle on your calendar is January 10. That's when the next ETF hits its final review date. The SEC has to say yes or no by that point.\n\nTowards the second part of your question, if we look at what happened in the Ethereum Futures ETF space, where those ETFs just launched two weeks ago, what we saw was the SEC lined up multiple providers to launch at once. I suspect the most likely scenario is the SEC will want to do the same thing here, give everyone an equal starting place, increase competition. And so I would circle that January 10 date. I don't mean on that date. I mean sometime between now and that date, we will find out if we are finally going to get the ETF."

        "content": "By Reuters\n\nBitcoin rose suddenly on Monday over a now-retracted media report.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBitcoin rose suddenly on Monday, before giving up nearly all its gains after asset manager BlackRock denied a crypto media report that US regulators had approved its high-profile application for a crypto investment product.\n\nBitcoin, known for its volatility, was last trading up 3.82% at $28,211 (around \u20ac26,600), after earlier rising as much as 10% to $29,900 (around \u20ac28,000), its highest since August.\n\nCrypto news outlet Coin Telegraph had earlier reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had approved an application by major asset manager BlackRock for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, before later retracting the story.\n\nBut bitcoin fell sharply after a Fox Business reporter said on the social media platform X (formerly called Twitter) that BlackRock denied the report.\n\nBlackRock later confirmed to Reuters that \"the iShares Bitcoin ETP application is still under review by the SEC.\" Sources close to the SEC also confirmed that the application is still pending.\n\n'Markets sensitive to good news'\n\n\"Crypto markets have just shown how sensitive they are to any potential good news, with their premature rally today on rumours of the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF,\" said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro.\n\nIn a post on X, Coin Telegraph apologised for its earlier post, which it said \"led to the dissemination of inaccurate information.\"\n\n\"An internal investigation is currently underway. We are committed to transparency and will share the findings of the investigation with the public once it is concluded within 3 hours,\" Coin Telegraph said. It also deleted its initial post.\n\nCrypto markets have been awaiting news on several pending spot bitcoin ETF applications, which, if approved, are widely expected to drive investment in the sector. The SEC has denied all spot bitcoin ETF applications on the grounds applicants have not shown they can protect investors from market manipulation.\n\n\"The move does show how monomaniacally obsessed the bitcoin market is with the coming spot ETFs,\" said Joseph Edwards, head of research at London crypto firm Enigma Securities.\n\nWhile the news about the SEC approving a spot bitcoin ETF on Monday was a \"false alarm,\" it was also a \"good dress rehearsal\" for when the regulator delivers a final decision on the applications, said Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer at Yield App.\n\n\"Headline risk is creating a lot of volatility ahead of this SEC announcement, with everyone trying to get ahead of it as the market will move markedly either way depending on the decision,\" he said.\n\nReuters was first to report on October 13 that the SEC would not appeal a recent court ruling that found it was wrong to reject an application from Grayscale Investments to create a spot bitcoin ETF, in a case that has been closely watched by the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington is now expected to issue a mandate within the next week specifying how its decision in the case should be executed, which will likely include instructing the SEC to revisit Grayscale's application."

        "title": "The secret life of Jimmy Zhong, who stole \u2013 and lost \u2013 more than $3 billion - CNBC",
        "content": "Athens, Georgia, is home to the University of Georgia, and the police there are used to college town-type crimes: break-ins, bar fights and assorted rowdiness. That kind of thing. But the 911 call that came in on the night of March 13, 2019, was unlike anything the Athens-Clarke County Police Department had ever encountered. On the phone was 28-year-old Jimmy Zhong, a local party boy and Georgia alum who frequented Athens' drinking establishments. He wasn't like the other town rowdies \u2013 Zhong was also a computer expert who had an unusually robust digital home surveillance system. Now, he was calling to report a crime: hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto currency that he said had been stolen from his home. Thinking of all that lost money, Zhong was distressed.\n\nIn March 2019, someone broke into Zhong's home, shattering the window. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\n\"I'm having a panic attack,\" Zhong told the dispatcher, according to a recording obtained by CNBC. Zhong turned down the dispatcher's offer of an ambulance, and began trying to explain the situation. \"I'm an investor in bitcoin , which is like an online thing,\" he said. What happened next would bring an end to a nearly decade long manhunt and solve one of the biggest crimes of the crypto era. And it also would lead to the largest seizure of cryptocurrency from an individual in the history of the Department of Justice. Zhong's emergency call that winter evening sent investigators down a long digital trail that led back to the earliest days of bitcoin and revealed a dark truth about the universe of hackers and coders responsible for the creation of cryptocurrencies. It's a world where heroes and villains traded places and could even be the same people. None of it would go at all the way Zhong wanted. The 911 call didn't produce a suspect in the theft from Zhong's house. Athens police were dealing with one of their first crypto cases and unfamiliar with the shadowy underworld, and they failed to make progress in the case. So Zhong turned to local private investigator Robin Martinelli, who owns and operates Martinelli Investigations in nearby Loganville, Georgia.\n\nRobin Martinelli, Martinelli Investigations owner and private investigator. CNBC\n\nA former sheriff's deputy turned PI, Martinelli was far from an expert in crypto. She specialized in process serving, cheating spouses and custody investigations, the type of probes that once got her firm featured on an episode of \"The Montel Williams Show.\" Martinelli had recently undergone surgery to amputate one leg, leaving her to conduct her surveillance operations with the help of a prosthetic. Still, she was motivated to solve Zhong's case. \"When you wake up and don't put two feet on the ground, but you still have to run a company, you got to get out there and kick ass,\" Martinelli told CNBC in an interview for the new documentary, \"Crypto 911: Exposing a Bitcoin Billionaire.\" She began by examining Zhong's robust surveillance video archive of his home. In looking at footage from the night of the crime, Martinelli spotted a slender male figure.\n\nSurveillance footage CNBC obtained captures someone breaking into Zhong's home in March 2019. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\n\"We could tell that they had like a hood on \u2013 a gray hood \u2013 but then they had almost like a black ski mask,\" Martinelli said. The suspect appeared to know his way around Zhong's house, which led Martinelli to believe that he was a friend or at least someone who had heard Zhong boast about his bitcoin stash. From the video, Martinelli was able to determine the suspect's height and even the size of his hands. She said she began her investigation by putting Zhong's friends under surveillance, following them to their homes and downtown bars on Broad Street and College Avenue. She put trackers on cars and scoured social media and conducted background checks. As she watched Zhong's bar friends come and go, Martinelli formed a low opinion of the group. She described them as \"very, very casual, plastic, not really caring, maybe using Jimmy a little bit.\" Martinelli said Zhong appeared resistant to her theories, especially when they began to focus on his circle of friends. Martinelli eventually settled on one suspect in particular who she believed had stolen 150 bitcoins from Jimmy. At the time, that amount of the digital currency was worth nearly $600,000. Zhong didn't want to hear it, she said. \"He would get upset when I would kind of mention somebody would had to have known where this cash was,\" Martinelli said. And she understood why Zhong was so hurt by the idea that someone close to him could have betrayed him. \"Jimmy wanted to be loved,\" she said. \"Jimmy wanted friends.\" Even as Martinelli soured on the friend group, she was warming up to her client, who she perceived as an odd man in search of friends. \"Jimmy was a good guy,\" she said. A lot of people around Athens felt similarly about him. In the years before the theft, Zhong was known for throwing a lot of money around town. He was the kind of guy who would buy a round of expensive shots for the whole bar, hundreds of dollars vanishing in seconds down eager throats.\n\nZhong pictured with two women in front of a limousine. Source: Zhong's social media profile\n\nAlthough he lived in a modest off-campus bungalow, near student housing and the downtown college bar scene, he stayed at fancy hotels, including the Ritz Carlton, the Plaza and the Waldorf Astoria, according to court documents CNBC reviewed. He shopped at high-end stores such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Jimmy Choo. He drove fancy cars, including a Tesla . He bought a second home, a lake house with a dock in Gainesville, Georgia, a short drive from Athens. He stocked it with jet skis, boats, a stripper pole, and lots and lots of liquor.\n\nZhong pictured with two women on a yacht. Source: Zhong's social media profile\n\nHis parties were epic. Zhong was living his best life with no visible source of income. As far as anyone knew, he didn't really have a job. He told his friends that he'd gotten into bitcoin early, mining thousands of coins in the earliest days of the technology. Zhong told people he dabbled in crypto as far back as 2009, the year bitcoin was invented by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto and a small crew of developers tied online to the anonymous crypto creator. Whatever Zhong was doing, he was making mountains of cash. And he was willing to splurge. In 2018, when his beloved Georgia Bulldogs football team made the Rose Bowl, Zhong rounded up a small group of friends for a pilgrimage to Los Angeles.\n\nZhong pictured with a group of friends at the 2018 Rose Bowl game. Source: Zhong's social media profile\n\n\"It really felt like with Jimmy, there were no limits,\" Stefana Masic, a Georgia alum and one of the friends on the trip, told CNBC.\n\nStefana Masic, Zhong's friend. CNBC\n\nMasic said not only did Zhong pay for all the tickets, but he also rented a private jet for the cross-country flight. And he gave each friend up to $10,000 for a Beverly Hills shopping spree on Rodeo Drive. They spent it on outfits, accessories and baubles to wear in the city. \"I had never flown private before, and I never stayed in such a nice Airbnb . It was cool because, you know, I got to experience a lot of things that I normally wouldn't.\" As he was cheering on his team in LA, Zhong couldn't have known that a small group of agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation unit, led by officials in the same city, were painstakingly trying to solve a crime that dated back years. What had captured the investigators' attention was a 2012 hack in which someone had stolen 50,000 bitcoins from a site on the dark web called Silk Road, according to court documents CNBC reviewed. That site was one of the earliest crypto marketplaces, where anonymous buyers and sellers exchanged all manner of illicit material. It was full of drugs, guns, pornography and other stuff people wanted to keep secret. Over the years, the value of the bitcoin stolen by the Silk Road hacker had soared to more than $3 billion, according to court documents. Investigators could track the location of the currency on the blockchain, which is a public ledger of all transactions. But they couldn't see the identity of the new owner of the funds. So they watched and waited for years as the hacker transferred funds from account to account, peeled some away, and pushed some of it through crypto \"mixers\" designed to obscure the source of the money. Finally, Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company that was tracing the digital wallets containing the stolen Silk Road assets, saw the hacker made a tiny mistake. He transferred around $800 worth to a crypto exchange that followed established banking rules, including so-called know your customer processes, requiring real names and addresses of account holders. The account was registered in Zhong's name. The transaction took place in September 2019, six months after Zhong's 911 call to the local police. That alone wasn't enough to prove Zhong was the hacker. They had to be sure. So the IRS called the Athens-Clarke County Police Department and asked for some help, according to sources at both agencies. At the time, the police investigation into Zhong's own crime report had been languishing. \"I got a call from an IRS agent,\" Lt. Jody Thompson, who leads the local property and financial crimes unit, told CNBC. \"And he said, 'can I come by and speak to you about Jimmy?' And I was like, sure, I remember this case.\"\n\nLt. Jody Thompson, Athens-Clarke County Police. CNBC\n\nAfter that, Thompson joined forces with IRS-CI special agent Trevor McAleenan and Shaun MaGruder, CEO of a cyber intelligence company called BlockTrace. MaGruder's company works with the IRS as an embedded contractor and was hired for its experience untangling complicated blockchain transactions.\n\nShaun MaGruder, BlockTrace CEO. CNBC\n\nTogether, the three investigators said they devised a plan. They would approach Zhong using a ruse, telling him they were investigating the crime that he'd called about, the one in which a thief had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars of his bitcoin. In reality, they were investigating Zhong for a crime they believed he had committed. A crime whose proceeds were now worth billions of dollars. When the three men knocked on the door of his lake home in Gainesville, Zhong opened it enthusiastically, according to body camera footage CNBC exclusively obtained. He believed the police officer and the two specialists were there to help solve his crypto cold case. \"If you guys solve this for me, I will invite you out for a party,\" Zhong told the trio on the body camera footage. The video shows the officers pouring on the praise. They called his front door \"beautiful.\" They called his speakers \"crazy,\" and they complimented his dog, Chad. They asked for a tour of the house. Body camera footage shows the men tapping on stone floors, looking in closets and checking out wood paneling. Zhong didn't know it, but they were scouring for secret compartments. Zhong brought investigators to his basement, equipped with a full bar and a stripper pole. \"Is this your workout?\" McAleenan asked Zhong. \"Nope, that's for girls,\" Zhong replied.\n\nBody camera footage CNBC obtained shows investigators in Zhong's basement, which contains a full bar and a stripper pole. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\nThe body camera footage also shows they got a good look at Zhong's security system, asking him to explain each of its features and capabilities. Zhong is also captured showing them a metal case he said he once used to store $1 million in cash so he could impress a woman. \"Did it work?\" asked Lt. Thompson. \"Nope,\" Zhong said. \"It never does,\" Thompson replied. The law enforcement officers learned that Zhong had a flamethrower on the premises. And they saw his AR-15 rifle hanging on the wall. MaGruder said Zhong's level of sophistication was apparent. \"He was navigating that keyboard like I've never seen someone navigate a keyboard,\" MaGruder said. \"He didn't have to use a mouse because he knew all the hotkeys.\" Playing on the ruse, the officers asked Zhong to open his laptop and explain how he came to have the bitcoin in the first place. Zhong sat on the couch next to the investigators and entered his password, asking them to turn away as he typed. When he opened the laptop, law enforcement could see his bitcoin wallet. \"Lo and behold, he had $60 or $70 million worth of bitcoins right there next to us,\" MaGruder told CNBC in an interview.\n\nBody camera footage CNBC obtained captures Zhong showing investigators millions of dollars of bitcoin on his laptop. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\nThe evidence was enough to convince the investigators they were on the right track. As he exited Zhong's lake house, MaGruder told CNBC he thought to himself, \"This is incredible. I think we found our guy.\" The first visit allowed the investigators to obtain a federal search warrant for Zhong's home, McAleenan said. McAleenan, MaGruder, and Thompson returned with an enormous team of officers on Nov. 9, 2021. Before the officers raided the house, McAleenan had to explain to Zhong that he wasn't really trying to help him. He was trying to convict him. \"I said, Jimmy, you know me as 'Trevor.' I'm actually Trevor McAleenan. I'm a special agent with IRS Criminal Investigation, and we're here to execute a federal-approved warrant on your house,\" McAleenan said.\n\nTrevor McAleenan, IRS-CI Special Agent. CNBC\n\n\"And he kind of had this look like, 'Am I being punked?'\" McAleenan added. At that moment, another officer slid a device known as a \"jiggler\" into Zhong's laptop, causing the cursor to continually move and giving law enforcement access to the password-protected contents of the computer, McAleenan said. Officers flooded into the home, cracking open every crevice in search of evidence. McAleenan said in an upstairs closet, they found a popcorn tin with a computer hidden inside that held millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards The popcorn tin where investigators found a single board computer hidden inside that held millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.

Court documents said the safe contained precious metals, stacks of cash and physical bitcoins minted in the early years of crypto. They also found a wallet with bitcoin from the original hack of Silk Road in 2012.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Physical bitcoin and cash investigators found during the search warrant. Source: IRS Criminal Investigations\n\nZhong was busted. \"Really late at night we were able to say we were successful,\" McAleenan said. \"We found the evidence that we were looking for. And the house lit up. I mean, every agent on the site cheered.\" As they sorted through the evidence, agents discovered something else about the unusual Mr. Zhong. He was, in crypto slang, an \"original gangster,\" or OG. Investigators discovered that as far back as 2009, the year bitcoin was invented, Zhong was among a small group of early coders who worked to develop and perfect the technology. He was a smaller contributor than some of the other OG players who have since become famous in the bitcoin community, McAleenan said. But investigators concluded that he made contributions to the original bitcoin code and offered ideas to the early developers on key topics like how to reduce blockchain size. In other words, a hacker who had been involved in the development of bitcoin itself went on to become one of the biggest bitcoin thieves of all time. \"He is one of the, as we dubbed it, the original gangsters, OGs, as far as bitcoin core software developers,\" McAleenan said. \"He had been in this space for quite a while.\" The irony of Zhong's role in the history of bitcoin is emblematic of the culture that built the cryptocurrency in the first place, said Nathaniel Popper, author of \"Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\"\n\nNathaniel Popper, author of \"Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\" CNBC\n\n\"Everybody came to this for their own reason,\" Popper told CNBC. \"And it was, as a result of that, a very sort of eclectic and eccentric group of people.\" \"Bitcoin was always shot through with irony,\" Popper said. \"Yes, there was something ironic about a bitcoin proponent stealing bitcoin from another bitcoin proponent. But I think that was also in some ways a part of what defined bitcoin.\" Zhong was charged with wire fraud. After pleading guilty, he was sentenced to one year and a day in federal prison. Zhong, now 33 years old, began his sentence at the federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, on July 14, 2023. In the end, Zhong didn't get to keep the stolen bitcoin. The U.S. government seized those assets. Officials opened a process that allowed victims of the hack to apply to get their bitcoin back, according to a forfeiture document CNBC reviewed. Nobody came forward to claim the loot. That's not surprising, given that users of Silk Road in 2012 were largely drug dealers and their customers. The federal government simply sold off the stolen bitcoin and will keep the proceeds. Some of the revenue generated will likely be shared with the Athens-Clarke County Police Department, in recognition of the local officers' help in the case, according to the IRS-CI. As he left the courthouse after his sentencing on April 14, CNBC attempted to question Zhong about his role in the crime. Zhong covered his head with his coat and left without saying a word. In his statement to the judge before sentencing, Zhong said having billions in stolen bitcoin made him feel important.\n\nZhong with his attorneys, Michael Bachner and John Garland, at sentencing. Source: IRS Criminal Investigations\n\nZhong's attorney, Michael Bachner, says the theft never actually damaged the U.S. government.\n\nMichael Bachner, Zhong's attorney. CNBC\n\n\"The government has certainly not been hurt by Jimmy's conduct whatsoever,\" Bachner told CNBC. \"If Jimmy had not stolen the coins and the government had in fact seized them from [Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht] they would have sold them two years later in 2014 as they did with other coins.\" At that point, the government \"would have gotten $320 a coin or made somewhere about $14 million,\" Bachner said. \"Now, as a result of Jimmy having them, the government has gotten a $3 billion profit.\" Zhong asked for no jail time because he was concerned about the fate of Chad, his 13-year-old dog. Zhong has had a difficult life. On the autism spectrum, Bachner said he was severely bullied at school. And he found solace over the years in an online community where he could deploy his computing skills.\n\nChad, Zhong's elderly dog. Source: Zhong's social media profile"

Almost 100% of BlackRock\u2019s previous ETF filings have been approved, so they probably would not have filed an application unless they thought approval was likely,\u201d said Hogan.\n\nSeveral experts echoed the above sentiment, including Nihar Neelakanti, CEO and co-founder of Ecosapiens. Neelakanti said it seems an approval of a spot BTC ETF is actually right around the corner \u2014 and, at the latest, is poised to happen early next year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just too much political pressure placed on the SEC for it not to approve, especially when you think about what institutions are involved here, such as BlackRock and Vanguard,\u201d said Neelakanti. \u201cLegally, with courts having essentially weighed in in favor of Grayscale and its proposed ETF, it\u2019s now almost impossible to resist an approval.\u201d\n\nNeelakanti added that when an approval happens, we will see a wall of money flooding into the space.\n\n\u201cWe saw a hint of this when there was false news reported recently about an approval of the iShares BTC ETF,\u201d said Neelakanti, referring to the erroneous news published earlier this week. \u201cThe price of BTC shot up 10% in seconds when that false approval news was reported. This tells me we will see something similar, and likely far more pronounced, when an actual approval happens.\u201d\n\nWhat Would a Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Mean for Investors?\n\nZachary Townsend, co-founder and CEO of Meanwhile, said the SEC\u2019s deadline for appealing the decision around Greyscale\u2019s ETF application passed a few days ago \u2014 that it\u2019s less a matter of if it will be approved, but rather when.\n\nAnd when a spot BTC ETF is approved, he said he expects tens of billions of dollars to flow into Bitcoin and then, indirectly, the broader digital asset ecosystem.\n\n\u201cSo many investors are keen on getting exposure to Bitcoin, but they don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of self-custody, which is difficult for even seasoned Bitcoiners,\u201d said Townsend.\n\nIn turn, he added that an approved spot BTC ETF will provide that kind of investment vehicle for investors \u2014 and that such a vehicle will also make it far easier for investment advisors to advise their clients in getting BTC exposure via one of these approved ETFs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a tremendous amount of passively invested money that is poised to go into these BTC products, which are likely going to be available for 401k-like investments and such,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue now is timing, and I think next year is likely when we will see these approvals come about. There could be more delays, of course, but next year seems likely to me.\u201d\n\nAnother impact of a potential approval is on Bitcoin\u2019s price, which, according to several experts, could shoot up once this happens.\n\nBradley Duke, chief strategy officer at ETC Group, said that Bitcoin holders are celebrating this news because they believe a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved in the U.S. will unleash pent-up demand. It is also believed that, ultimately, the ETF issuers will need to buy and hold a lot of Bitcoin to back these ETFs.\n\n\u201cWith the total supply of Bitcoin being fixed at 21 million coins, this jump in demand will undoubtedly lead to upward price pressure on the Bitcoin spot price,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how big this pent-up demand is and the timing thereof, but many institutional investors will get comfort from the fact that asset management giants like Blackrock will be issuing these new products, along with the fact that just about every major U.S. player in financial services, now has some kind of business in crypto \u2014 from Goldman Sachs to Fidelity, from Citadel to Charles Schwab and many others.\u201d\n\nCan Approval Help the Broader Crypto Space?\n\nWhile a spot Bitcoin ETF has the potential to increase Bitcoin adoption, particularly among traditional financial players and advisors, it\u2019s important to note that the ETF has certain limitations in comparison to owning actual Bitcoin. This is the position held by David Waugh, business development and communications specialist at Coinbits.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, an ETF can act as a connection for financial professionals who were previously hesitant or unprepared to enter the cryptocurrency space, which could positively impact Bitcoin\u2019s price,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he noted that ETFs are restricted because they operate within the traditional financial system, so they do not provide complete protection against market, government, or compliance risks that holding Bitcoin in self-custody does.\n\n\u201cIn other words, Bitcoin ETFs make the asset more accessible, but they do not fully encompass the revolutionary autonomy and protection that Bitcoin represents as a decentralized asset,\u201d he added.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Cryptocurrency Is About To Go Mainstream With Latest Bitcoin ETF \u2014 Can It Make Owning Crypto More Profitable?"

        "content": "In a significant move this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved nine exchange-traded funds that invest in ethereum futures contracts.\n\nDoes this mean the SEC will soon allow spot bitcoin ETFs onto the market?\n\nInvestors are anxiously waiting for the SEC\u2019s decision. In August, the SEC was ordered by a court to vacate its rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Last week, the SEC decided not to appeal the court\u2019s ruling in the Grayscale case or require Grayscale to refile its application, which could have delayed approval for as much as a year.\n\nAlthough the arrival of ethereum futures ETFs is a welcome step toward the mainstreaming of crypto, there\u2019s no assurance yet that the SEC will act immediately to approve the 10 pending spot bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nThe situation is frustrating for everyone. Everyone except SEC Chair Gary Gensler seems to understand that a spot bitcoin ETF would be in investors\u2019 best interests, and greatly enhance consumer safety and protection against fraud.\n\nETFs are deservedly the most popular investment vehicle in the world; they feature low costs, low account minimums, transparency, liquidity, and ease of portfolio management.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for advisors to engage in portfolio rebalancing, dollar cost averaging and tax loss harvesting.\n\nAccess to virtually every other asset class is available through ETFs \u2014 and there are even inverse, 3x and single-stock ETFs. So why not a bitcoin ETF?\n\nGensler\u2019s refusal has raised everyone\u2019s ire. Four members of Congress \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 wrote to the SEC in late September demanding that it approve these ETFs immediately."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Price Jumps as SEC Won't Continue Its Court Dispute With Grayscale - CoinDesk",
        "content": "It looks like the SEC won't appeal court ruling against gray scale as we reported here, the move boost the odds of the gray scale Bitcoin Trust uh potentially turning into a more appealing ETF So joining us now to discuss is the author of the crypto trader Glenn Goodman. Welcome back as always, Glenn. Good to be here. Glad to see you. OK. So, you know, we had this uh rally overnight uh overnight uh New York time, midday, Asia, what do you think drove it? Was it this enthusiasm about stuff that happened two or three days ago uh with a potential uh decision by the SEC of uh not appealing this uh this potential ETF uh from gray scale. Yeah, I think that that has to be the reason uh because stock markets which have been watching closely in the futures before opening and so on. Uh and in Asia uh are up a little bit, but they're not really showing the same kind of enthusiasm that the uh Bitcoin market is, which tells me that yes, it is uh a sort of renewed Asian excitement as in the Asian markets this morning to the idea that there might actually finally be this mythical, uh Bitcoin ETF that it might finally come to exist. Did, did what happened with the Ether ETF s that came to the market a few, a few weeks ago here. Uh Now we, you know, we saw about nine of them hit the market. The lackluster and performance did, is this, does this mean that potentially a spot ETF for Bitcoin is already priced in, uh, with, you know, maybe the SEC, if they're going to have to approve it, they'll just say, all right, we'll let them all go to the market and see if they'll fail. Like the, uh, ETF for, for the E futures, I don't think really, it's a matter of failing. It's just, you know, we're in a pretty boring time in the markets as you, as you talk about on the show, um, very often, you know, whenever I tune in quite a lot of the time, you're like, God, when are things gonna get more exciting and, you know, not young ones. If you, if you ever remember the show, the young ones, everything was boring. Everything was boring but like, are boring, you know, too much excitement is not always good at my age, at my age. No, I can't have excitement. I get very nervous. You'll remember the pop star, Cliff Richard was the only thing that excited you. That was only Rick though. Yeah, that's true. Uh, for, for those of you who never watch the show. You go, you gotta watch it. It's probably online anyway. Um, but, but, yeah, I mean, it's the thing about, about these ETF S is that they are going to succeed or fail based on excitement around the crypto space. And, ok, so, you know, this is not unusual. We're in the, the usual kind of part of the cycle where everything gets a bit boring. Now, I'm not the kind of person who necessarily believes that everything is preordained and that just because we've had the same cycle over and over again, you know, over the course of more than a decade now that it's going to repeat yet again in exactly the same way. In fact, we actually did see, of course, in this last cycle that something different happened because we'd always in the past in Bitcoin's price had a single big peak and then uh the decline would begin at the top of uh each, each uh cycle. But this last time round, of course, we had two peaks. We, we had one in uh about April May, uh 2021 and another one in November. So, you know, that was a, an unusual occurrence. So we can't take it for granted that the cycle is gonna repeat exactly the same way as last time. But so far, uh this bear market is playing out shape wise, you know, on the chart like that in, in very much the same way as it has done in previous cycles. And so therefore, we can kind of uh semi, I assume that next year, sometime we're going to start seeing the excitement building once again. And Bitcoin ETF s if they come to exist by then will benefit from that. I have no doubt. It's, it's just a matter of hype, excitement and narrative and frankly, the narrative that a Bitcoin ETF is now here and institutions can invest and retail uh ordinary retail investors can invest in it in a, in a more pain free way. I think that that will probably be one of the chief narratives going into the next cycle. Yes, you could argue that it's priced in and the idea of it happening is already priced in amongst the hardcore, the people who are still here and investing, but it's certainly not priced in among the uh the newer investors. And indeed people who've got bored with crypto, but we'll come back to it once prices start rising, Jen, I'll let you, I'll let you go in a second but it did my audio fail because I didn't hear the word having in any of that. You didn't say the word having, having, you did not say having, you did not, you did not talk about the Bitcoin having or having the halving I'm English. It was like having having that. That's the bit of New Jersey in me. Yeah. Um Yes, I mean that is significant actually, I was, I was looking at, uh, the various hals or HALS on my chart yesterday, over time and, you know, you can't get away from the conclusion that they do go inside rather neatly with, uh, with a sort of a little period of, of continued sideways movement and then a big takeoff. And again, it's, you know, I don't believe that anything is necessarily preordained and yet we have seen pretty much the same thing happen several times in a row. I don't think that's a coincidence. I think actually, rather than being um a supply constriction issue. I, I don't believe that because I believe the demand massively determines what happens in the Bitcoin and crypto markets, the demand skyrockets and then plummets, you know, that overwhelms any little change in supply that might happen with halving. But uh there is a self fulfilling prophecy element to the halving. As in it becomes a narrative. Everybody expects it to lead to uh a big price rise because it has done always in the past. And therefore, you know, people get in that mood, that buying mood, they get more optimistic, put that hand in hand with a spot, Bitcoin ETF and things line up quite nicely for, I would guess, you know, if we're gonna take a rough guess later on next year. All right, Glenn, we got to ask you for some predictions. So some market watchers are looking at this lack of appeal from the SEC in the gray scale suit, um, as an indicator that we could have a spot, Bitcoin ETF launch in January. Do you agree? And if you do, do you think that they're going to approve, you know, a bunch of ETF S at the same time like they did with Ether futures, ETF and remove that first mover advantage? Well, I've been, I've been studying it quite closely. Well, I mean, I had been anyway, but in preparation for this interview, I've read just about everything there is to try and work out what the chances are to try and gauge the chances. But, uh, it, it seems to me that ultimately, the sec haven't got much of a leg to stand on in terms of arguments. Yeah. Ok. They could put a few little roadblocks in the way saying, oh, well, you haven't quite sorted out arrangements for custody, uh, or, you know, we need a creation redemption function and don't forget you'll have to list on the New York Stock Exchange. You know, they could make things difficult and try and delay it a little bit longer, but they haven't any more after this court decision really got a major argument in their favor. What they do have though, of course, is Gary Gensler and his seeming, um, knee jerk dislike for all things, Bitcoin and crypto. And so even though they might have a strong argument, he's still the boss and maybe he will just find things to stop it from happening. But like you quite rightly pointed out, there are the likes of Blackrock and Fidelity now, you know, bearing down upon him, they want their ETF S approved. So they're going to be saying, you know, well, you haven't got any more excuses and they're pretty powerful. Who knows how scared he is of them or isn't of them? I suspect that they will have some influence because they're just such enormous players. And yes, if one Bitcoin ETF gets approved one spot, Bitcoin ETF, I suspect the whole lot will be there competing with each other. All right. And we got to ask you about this news that just came out this morning. The FTX bankruptcy. A state has apparently staked millions of E and Seoul. What kind of impact do you think this is going to have on the markets? I'm not sure it will have much of an impact price wise, but it's interesting that they've done this obviously because, I mean, you know, the actual amounts that have been staked aren't, aren't massively huge. I don't think they'll have that big an impact on prices, as I say. But, um, what's interesting about this is that I, I guess they're kind of um trapped with their crypto at this point and they have to stake it if they want to make any kind of yield. But, you know, for all those people out there who might be thinking of following suit. You know, far be it from me to discourage people from doing crypto and Bitcoin things. But let's not forget that money market funds are now offering about 5.5% yield in the United States. And those are, you know, not 100% safe, but as close to it as you could possibly get and you don't really get much more of a yield, I think less than 1% in addition to that uh for staking soul. So, so it kind of uh you know, the attractions of staking aren't quite what they were a couple of years ago. Put it that way, Glen, thanks so much for joining us this morning. Always a pleasure having you on. Good to be here and I'm glad I'm glad you do a lot of research before, before signing on. I was like, you know, you have tough, you know, your stuff. I got to be on my, on my a game as you New Jersey. People would say, we love a well researched guest. Glenn, thanks so much for being here this morning. See, you see, we should, we should note that gray scale and coin desk are both owned by DC G. That was the author of the crypto trader Glenn Goodman."

        "content": "Ferrari is one of the world\u2019s most exclusive brands, which means it can pick and choose which of the customers beating down its doors will get the keys to the next luxury sports car proudly bearing its signature prancing horse on the grill.\n\nSo news out of its Maranello headquarters that the Italian manufacturer now accepts cryptocurrencies as payment for its vehicles makes the announcement that much more unusual\u2014not even Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla offers that option.\n\n\u201cThis will help us connect to people who are not necessarily our clients but might afford a Ferrari,\u201d the company\u2019s sales chief, Enrico Galliera, told Reuters in an interview published on Saturday.\n\nIn order to avoid being hit by volatile swings in the price of Bitcoin\u2019s BTC and Ethereum\u2019s ETH\u2014two of the three currencies it will accept alongside Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin\u2014it will offload the risk to BitPay, a major provider of crypto payment services.\n\nThat way Ferrari avoids having to hold tokens on its own balance sheet, exposing its investors to crypto market risks like those emanating from last year\u2019s collapse of Terra/Luna, Celsius, 3AC, and most important FTX.\n\n\u201cThis was one of our main goals: avoiding, both [for] our dealers and us, to directly handle cryptocurrencies and being shielded from their wide fluctuations,\u201d Galliera told the news agency.\n\nGiven the anonymity provided by digital wallets\u2014which heightens their appeal for shadier elements in society\u2014BitPay will ensure that the payments are not illicitly gained money, laundered for the purposes of organized crime or tax evasion.\n\nGalliera said the decision, which resulted from requests by dealers and customers, would be limited to the U.S. market initially, but it plans to add Europe early next year.\n\nFamous for its mid-engine V12 supercars like the Enzo and LaFerrari, the company recently launched the first four-door model in the brand\u2019s 84-year history, the Purosangue crossover.\n\nThis departure from its strict devotion to coupes, once considered unthinkable, enables it to poach customers away from the Lamborghini Urus, Aston Martin DBX, and Bentley Bentayga.\n\nThe rapidly growing luxury crossover segment is popular in China, where demand for the kind of two-door luxury sports cars, in which Ferrari specializes, underperforms versus other regions, such as the U.S.\n\nFortune contacted Ferrari for further details on its crypto payment plans, but could not reach a representative.\n\nTesla abandoned its brief foray into crypto car sales\n\nTesla briefly attempted in early 2021 to accept payments for its cars in BTC, after buying $1.5 billion worth of the digital coin, but the effort lasted only a few weeks. CEO Elon Musk subsequently yanked the offer, citing three expos\u00e9s (including one from Fortune) revealing the voracious amount of energy the Bitcoin blockchain devours to power the compute-heavy consensus mechanism known as Proof of Work.\n\nMusk suffered several heavy impairment charges on the value of Tesla\u2019s BTC stake before liquidating the bulk of its remaining holdings last year. At the time he sought to placate his crypto-enthusiasts by claiming it wasn\u2019t a vote against the technology but owing to concerns he had about the \u201coverall liquidity of the company.\u201d\n\nSince then, Musk has allowed only a handful of select Tesla branded items in its merchandising store to be sold in Dogecoin, despite being well known for his support of the technology and numerous requests from his community to bring the option back.\n\nFerrari\u2019s Galliera did not reveal how many cars it expects to sell through crypto, but he said the company wanted to launch this experiment in a universe whose popularity exploded during the pandemic.\n\nEvery luxury brand needs to continuously rejuvenate its image to remain aspirational, and digitally native Zoomers often have vastly different attitudes toward brands and products than any other generation before them.\n\nThis is especially true among younger consumers disillusioned by traditional finance, known as \u201cTradFi.\u201d Instead they turned to decentralized finance, or \u201cDeFi\u201d, like cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based goods as a more appealing alternative.\n\n\u201cSome [customers] are young investors who have built their fortunes around cryptocurrencies,\u201d Galliera said."

        "content": "\u201cWe\u2019re contorting ourselves to pass through the keyhole of tyranny.\u201d Edward Snowden\u2019s words to the audience at the packed Genesis Stage hall at Bitcoin Amsterdam stressed the preeminent cryptocurrency\u2019s ever-increasing importance in a world beset by creeping government surveillance, devaluing fiat currencies and restrictive policies.\n\nThe renowned whistleblower\u2019s address summed up a recurring theme during the conference, driving home the role of decentralized protocols like Bitcoin and Nostr in giving individuals some control over their wealth and privacy.\n\nCointelegraph spoke to prominent Bitcoin developers, investors, builders and supporters attending the two-day conference at the picturesque Westerpark neighborhood in Amsterdam. Amid the ongoing cryptocurrency bear market, the event attracted a couple of thousand attendees searching for the latest news and insights in the Bitcoin (BTC) industry.\n\nSnowden delivers a live virtual address during the conference. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nWhile many prominent figures highlighted the value proposition of Bitcoin as a store of value against the diminishing purchasing power of fiat currencies, Snowden was critical of the continual focus on the value of BTC over its importance as a decentralized tool:\n\n\u201cWe are all part of a bigger game, and Bitcoin is one of the strongest levers in that. The systems that we are influencing, that we are exerting leverage on, [such as] payments and finance, will shape what the world of tomorrow looks like.\u201c\n\nSnowden\u2019s address arguably attracted the biggest gathering of visitors during the conference, as he revisited Bitcoin\u2019s role in his journey rebelling against the United States government and its wanton surveillance of citizens.\n\nIn 2013, Snowden used Bitcoin to pay for the servers that hosted classified information sent to journalists that would reveal the National Security Agency\u2019s overreach into the lives of American citizens. As Snowden elaborated, Bitcoin\u2019s growing prominence has led to increasing opposition from governments, lawmakers and legacy financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to focus on things like ETFs [exchange-traded funds]; we need to focus on the fundamentals.\u201d\n\nSnowden added that the potential influence of Bitcoin ETFs on the value of the cryptocurrency represents \u201csubordination, a kind of subjugation, a process of taming\u201d that is being played out by institutions that regulate traditional financial spheres.\n\nSnowden also shared his belief that Bitcoin has \u201ca privacy problem,\u201d highlighting the emergence of obfuscation tools like CoinJoin and mixers as important but equally indicative of the pressure facing the decentralized protocol.\n\n\u201cActing in secret is not freedom. The necessity of CoinJoins and so on \u2014 that is because you are unfree. Proof of funds is proof of unfreedom.\u201d\n\nSnowden said that society needs to stop asking for permission by continuing to innovate with the creation of decentralized tools that do not heed the powers that be, referring to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s actions against the wider cryptocurrency space in 2023 as a prime example of the control that currently exists:\n\n\u201cAll of the people tracking price and looking at headlines involving the SEC, Gary Gensler is not daddy Bitcoin, I don\u2019t really care what he thinks, and I don\u2019t think you should either.\u201c\n\nThe whistleblower also tipped his hat to the creation of Nostr, which he described as powerful in conceptualizing the integration of free speech and free trade. The creators of Nostr would later unpack the genesis of the platform at the conference, which also drew a significant crowd.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "content": "In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto founded the cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). Here\u2019s a look back at the pseudonymous creator and the price history of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat Happened: In October 2008, Nakamoto published a whitepaper titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d It provided many key details and explained why Bitcoin was being created.\n\nIn January 2009, Nakamoto mined the genesis block of the first 50 Bitcoins.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was released, there were only two ways to get the cryptocurrency: You could either mine the Bitcoin yourself or use a peer-to-peer transaction.\n\nBitcointalk, a forum created by Nakamoto to host discussions on Bitcoin, was used for several transactions, which were deemed risky at the time because they required trust from both parties and were mostly anonymous.\n\nIn October 2009, one of the first-ever recognized Bitcoin transactions happened when a Finnish computer science student sold 5,050 Bitcoin for $5.02 (which represented a value of $0.0009 for each Bitcoin), according to Forbes. The transaction took place on PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL).\n\nLess than a year later, in May 2010, one of the most famous Bitcoin transactions of all-time \u2014 and what is widely believed to be the first retail transaction \u2014 took place when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz sought out a person to buy him pizza in exchange for Bitcoin. A person in England subsequently spent around $41 to buy Papa John\u2019s International Inc (NASDAQ: PZZA) pizza in exchange for 10,000 Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas, like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over the next day,\u201d Hanyecz said in the infamous online post.\n\nNow known as \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day,\u201d May 22 pays tribute to the day of that very famous Bitcoin transaction. At the time, Bitcoin had a value of around $0.0041.\n\nIt wasn't until 2011 and after the launch of several major crypto exchanges that the cryptocurrency hit a price of $1.\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,789.63 as part of a year that saw increased interest in the leading cryptocurrency and many other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2022, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell in value and interest with several notable cryptocurrency trading platforms declaring bankruptcy.\n\nGoing forward, there is optimism for Bitcoin with several major financial institutions having pending Bitcoin ETF filings that could be approved and create increased demand from institutions for the crypto with limited supply.\n\nRelated Link: How To Buy Bitcoin Investing $1,000 in Bitcoin: Using the early transactions referenced above, a hypothetical investment in Bitcoin in the early days could have provided quite the return for its holder, or in this case a \u201chodler.\u201d\n\nA $1,000 investment in Bitcoin at the time of the first transaction on PayPal would have netted 1,111,111.11 Bitcoin, even though that amount of cryptocurrency probably wouldn't have been available due to mining constraints. That $1,000 investment would be worth $31,247,366,635.40 today based on a price of $28,122.63 for Bitcoin at the time of writing.\n\nIn contrast, a $1,000 investment in Bitcoin at the time of the Bitcoin-pizza transaction would have netted 243,902.44 BTC. That investment would be worth $6,859,178,076.22 today based on the same price of $28,122.63 at the time of writing.\n\nWhile investing in Bitcoin today may never be worth billions of dollars in the future, the hypothetical investment illustrates the large increase in value of the leading cryptocurrency over time.\n\nMany have predicted Bitcon's death over the years, but the cryptocurrency remains the leader in the space and has a market capitalization of over $500 billion today.\n\nRead Next: 13 Fun Facts About Bitcoin\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event - Future of Digital Assets.

        "title": "How the US Government Became One of the World's Largest Bitcoin Holders - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe US government has amassed around 200,000 Bitcoin from its three largest seizures alone.\n\nAgencies such as the DEA and FBI have often seized cryptocurrencies as part of their law enforcement actions.\n\nIt can often take years for the government to offload its crypto assets.\n\nIn some cases, the process is complicated by the ownership claims of other involved parties.\n\nAll the way back in 2013, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) seized 11.02 BTC from a South Carolina man attempting to buy illegal substances online. The seizure was the first of its kind and marked the beginning of a multi-billion dollar asset appropriation program spanning the DEA, FBI, and other US law enforcement agencies.\n\nBut, 10 years later, according to an analysis by 21.co, the US government now holds around 200,000 Bitcoin worth more than $5B, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world.\n\nThe US Government\u2019s Biggest Bitcoin Hauls\n\nWhen the DEA reported its first Bitcoin bust, the crypto in question was worth just $814. But in the years since, US agencies have moved on to much larger fish.\n\nDollar value of US government\u2019s 3 largest Bitcoin seizures.\n\nAs reported by 21.co, the government\u2019s single largest haul was 94,643 BTC seized from wallets controlled by Heather Morgan and her husband Ilya Lichtenstein. Earlier this year, Morgan and Lichtenstein pleaded guilty to orchestrating a scheme to launder proceeds from the 2016 hack of the Bitfinex crypto exchange.\n\nBoth the second- and third-largest stashes of Bitcoin obtained by the government stem from the Silk Road darknet market.\n\nThe most valuable Silk Road seizure was undertaken by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2020. After the government successfully traced assets that had been stolen from the platform prior to it being shut down, the IRS commandeered 69,369 BTC from an unidentified Silk Road hacker\n\nA year later, law enforcement seized an additional 51,326 BTC from James Zhong, who siphoned the funds from the marketplace between 2012 and 2014.\n\nAlthough the three largest government bitcoin busts account for around 200,000 BTC between them, the real value of the government\u2019s bitcoin holdings could be even higher as that figure is only a lower-bound estimation based on publicly available information.\n\nBitcoin Ownership Contested as Government Stash Grows\n\nFor the roughly $5B worth of BTC associated with the three largest seizures, it is unlikely that there will be any legal challenges to the government\u2019s ownership of the Silk Road Assets.\n\nEven the imprisoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht has already forfeited any claim to the seized Bitcoin as part of a deal that saw the government use some of the assets to pay off Ulbricht\u2019s $183 million court debt.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the Bitfinex funds, the exchange itself has a legitimate claim to the seized Bitcoin.\n\nIn a statement , Bitfinex said it will work with the DoJ to \u201cestablish our rights to a return of the stolen Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, although Bitfinex insists that it has settled its debts with users who lost funds to the hack, many of the exchange\u2019s customers contest that they should be entitled to some of the seized Bitcoin, setting up a potential legal clash.\n\nGovernment BTC Sales Follow Procedure, Not Market Rates\n\nDue to the drawn-out legal process required to liquidate its holdings, and the need to consider legitimate legal claims like Bitfinex\u2019s (and its customers\u2019), it can take years for the government to convert its Bitcoin into dollars.\n\nThe WSJ just sprotofied the American flag.

The firm noted in its analysis that these are \u201clower-bound estimations of the U.S. government holdings based on publicly available information.\u201d\n\nU.S. government Bitcoin holdings. Source: Dune\n\nThe analysis tracked the Bitcoin movement of the U.S. government wallets associated with the three largest BTC seizures since 2020, namely the Silk Road seizure of 69,369 BTC in November 2020, the Bitfinex Hack seizure of 94,643 BTC in January 2022, and the James Zhong seizure of 51,326 BTC in March 2022.\n\nKey Bitcoin seizures by U.S. government.

The U.S. Marshals Service, the principal agency charged with selling seized property, only receives possession of the seized Bitcoin after a court issues a definitive forfeiture judgment.\n\nThe U.S. government also sells a portion of the seized Bitcoin from time to time through an auction system based on court liquidation orders. The most notable government auction dates back to 2014, when billionaire Tim Draper bought 30,000 BTC from U.S. government auctions in 2014.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the U.S. government has turned to crypto exchanges to sell seized Bitcoin over public auctions. One such sale came in March earlier this year when the government sold 9,118 BTC on Coinbase, as confirmed through a public filing.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

        "content": "To function, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology. This is an information storage and transmission technology that connects buyers and sellers. All in complete security and transparency.\n\nWhile the aim of blockchain is to structure large volumes of information, it is no ordinary database. And for good reason: this technology takes the form of a set of interconnected blocks managed by electronic devices. Each block contains information which, once stored, cannot be modified. As soon as new information is received, the block is sealed by a computer code and added to another code. This forms a chain of blocks (hence blockchain).\n\nAll new transactions are grouped together in blocks. To add new data to the blocks, you need to mine Bitcoins. This means performing increasingly complex mathematical equations to verify the accuracy of the blocks.\n\nThese equations are necessary because Bitcoin\u2019s founders limited the amount of currency in circulation to 21 million units. However, at the start of 2023, there are already 18.3 million Bitcoins in circulation. The idea is to divide Bitcoins into small fractions (down to one hundred millionth) to ensure their availability. And all the while guaranteeing their accuracy."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price of bitcoin briefly spiked as much as 10% on Monday after a false report said that the Securities and Exchange Commission had approved the first spot bitcoin ETF from BlackRock.\n\nIn a now deleted tweet, crypto-focused news outlet CoinTelegraph had reported on Twitter \"BREAKING: SEC APPROVES ISHARES BITCOIN SPOT ETF.\"\n\nBlackRock owns and operates the iShares ETF brand.\n\nThe price of bitcoin immediately surged as much as 10% to a high of $29,900. But those gains quickly vanished after a spokesperson for BlackRock told Bloomberg that its spot bitcoin ETF application was still under review by the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoinTelegraph followed up with a tweet, saying: \"We apologize for a tweet that led to the dissemination of inaccurate information regarding the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF. An internal investigation is currently underway.\"\n\nBitcoin pared its gains and is now up about 3%, hovering slightly above the $28,000 level.\n\nThe volatility spike in bitcoin on Monday highlights the hope investors have been holding onto for the SEC to approve a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile the agency has approved bitcoin futures ETFs, it has repeatedly denied and delayed bitcoin spot ETF applications over the past few years, but hope has been renewed after massive asset management firms like BlackRock and Fidelity threw their hat into the ring with their own bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHope for a bitcoin spot ETF also surged after Grayscale Investments won a court appeal, which said that the SEC's decision to reject an application from Grayscale to convert its bitcoin trust fund into a spot bitcoin ETF was wrong.\n\nA recent Reuters report said that the SEC would not appeal that decision, lending some hope to investors that a spot bitcoin ETF could be imminent, including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood.\n\n\"I do think the SEC is moving now... some of the research that we believe is percolating up to [regulatory] commissioners might be getting through to them and might be the grounds now for the approval of a bitcoin ETF. And we don't think that the SEC will approve just one. They will probably approve a group of them,\" Wood said in a recent interview.\n\nThere are currently more than 10 spot bitcoin ETF applications under review by the SEC."

        "title": "Grayscale bitcoin discount narrows as ETF switch seen 'inevitable' - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The world\u2019s largest bitcoin fund is surging faster than the cryptocurrency itself as investors anticipate that an exchange-traded fund centered on the token could soon launch.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is trading about 14% below the value of its underlying holdings intraday, the narrowest such reading going back to 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The discount stood near 50% earlier this year.\n\nThe shares of the trust have rallied much more than the digital asset itself this year, with GBTC gaining 164% and bitcoin adding about 71%. On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to appeal an earlier positive court ruling for Grayscale.\n\nThe discount has narrowed significantly in recent weeks, as many analysts who closely follow the going-ons of the trust are anticipating that it will soon convert into an exchange-traded fund, something Grayscale has been saying for years it would like to accomplish. The odds of that happening moved in Grayscale\u2019s favor after the crypto asset manager in August scored a legal victory in federal court in its conversion bid.\n\n\u201cApproval of a spot bitcoin ETF looks inevitable at this point, given the court\u2019s Aug. 29 ruling, the number of recent spot bitcoin ETF applications and the SEC\u2019s engagement with them,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Elliott Stein and James Seyffart wrote in a note. \u201cBillions in unlocked value\u201d are at stake, they added.\n\nExcitement around potential ETF approval was evident Monday when a rumor sparked a roughly 10% rally for bitcoin after unverified sources said BlackRock had received the green-light from the SEC. Bitcoin reversed most of those gains after BlackRock debunked the speculation. However, the episode served as a reminder of the enthusiasm among crypto investors for such a product.\n\nStein and Seyffart argue that chances of Grayscale achieving the conversion heightened after the SEC opted against appealing the August ruling. The regulator could still appeal to the Supreme Court, though most see that as unlikely to happen.\n\nThe crypto industry has remained decimated since the downfall of the FTX exchange and a number of other companies last year, all of which has kept token prices depressed. Bitcoin, trading at around $28,000 Monday, is down from a record high of near $69,000 in late 2021. Bitcoin was up about 3.6% as of 10:42 a.m. in New York, while GBTC shares rose 7.9%.\n\nThe battle for a bitcoin ETF has been one bright spot for the industry, with many analysts forecasting that one could soon start trading in the U.S. after a decade-long battle by issuers to get one launched.\n\nIssuers have for years tried their hand at getting a spot bitcoin ETF off the ground in the U.S.. Officials have in the past cited market manipulation and other factors as reasons to not green-light applications, though they allowed ETFs based on bitcoin futures to start trading in 2021. But there are currently more than 10 filings for spot bitcoin ETFs, with industry heavyweights like BlackRock and Invesco among those in the race.\n\n\u201cThe increasing likelihood that the market will get its first U.S.-listed spot BTC ETF within the next few months\u201d is one factor currently supporting bitcoin, said Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto Is Macro Now\u201d newsletter.\n\nThe next steps in Grayscale\u2019s fight for its GBTC-to-ETF conversion could involve an opening up of dialog between the crypto firm and the SEC, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Any clarity on this front is being seen as a positive as the process has remained opaque in terms of how many issuers might get approval \u2014 and under what circumstances \u2014 and whether multiple ETFs would be allowed to trade all at once, or if any one company might get a head start over its competitors.\n\nThough GBTC\u2019s discount to its holdings has narrowed significantly, it likely wouldn\u2019t go all the way to zero until the actual ETF conversion happens or is announced, according to BI. Still, any positive developments could help send the reading closer to zero, Seyffart said.\n\n\u201cThe news in the U.S. over Grayscale\u2019s ETF application has potentially very significant ramifications for the bitcoin market. The story of spot-price ETF approval has been a dominant narrative in the bitcoin market for several months now,\u201d said Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro. \u201cAs the barriers to approval fall, hopes among investors continue to rise that we could see these products in the market sooner rather than later.\u201d"

The $5 billion holdings consist of the three seizures mentioned.\n\nThe BTC is kept primarily offline in hardware wallets, which are encrypted storage devices, held by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service.

As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Jarod Koopman, executive director of the IRS\u2019s cyber and forensics services section said, \u201cWe don\u2019t play the market. We basically are set by the timing in our process.\u201d\n\nThe government is not involved in any HODLing (holding onto assets without the selling intention) nor is it waiting for the token value to rise before selling.\n\nWhile the U.S. government previously would sell a partial portion of the seized Bitcoin through an auction system based on court liquidation orders, it now looks to crypto exchanges to offload any seized tokens. In March 2023, a public filing indicated the offloading of 9,118 BTC on Coinbase by the government.\n\nBenzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference is scheduled for Nov. 14.

Like how people used to buy property or buy gold, whereas it has digital characteristics.\u201d\n\nThe analyst adds that Bitcoin continues to be a means for citizens of countries facing hyperinflation to safeguard and control their wealth:\n\n\u201cThe people using Bitcoin \u2014 the true adopters \u2014 have more conviction than ever, and it\u2019s more widespread than ever. People in third-world countries are using Bitcoin not because it\u2019s fashionable or hyped. It\u2019s because they\u2019re using it to save them from losing everything.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph journalist Joe Hall (right) hosts a panel featuring Rene Pickhardt and Jimmy Song during Bitcoin Amsterdam 2023.

The autonomous Portuguese archipelago is set to launch a Bitcoin business hub as a means to drive the adoption of the cryptocurrency.\n\nKara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 has become a Bitcoin advocate in recent years and now works for Jan3, a Bitcoin firm founded by Samson Mow looking to drive nation-state use of BTC. Conversations centered around the potential of Bitcoin highlighted how the digital asset has different value propositions for developed, developing and first-world economies.\n\n\u201cIn developing countries, you\u2019ll see much more adoption there \u2014 countries that really have double and triple-digit inflation, your Lebanon\u2019s, Nigeria\u2019s, Argentina\u2019s.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, developed nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland will see varying degrees of adoption dependent on regulation and education.\n\nNSA whistleblower Edward Snowden stressed the importance of Bitcoin in combatting tyranny and governmental overreach while providing individual sovereignty of wealth during a virtual address at the conference.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "content": "Why today's Bitcoin surge was short lived and there's a new crypto law in California. You're watching Coin Desk Daily. I'm your host, Jen Sani. Let's take a look at the markets. The coin desk, Bitcoin price XPX index is currently around $28,000. The prices come down after surging earlier today to $30,000. That spike was caused by a false report of a spot. Bitcoin ETF approval that was posted on X. That report has since been redacted. This comes just days after another report said that the SEC won't appeal the loss in its case against Grayscale, which is thought to boost the chances of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust eventually being converted to a spot. ETF Grayscale and Coindesk are both owned by DC G coin issuer. Tether has frozen funds and 32 Cryptocurrency addresses linked to terrorism and warfare in Israel and the Ukraine. In a press release, Tether said that it has been working with Israel's National Bureau for counterterror financing. The owner cannot transfer funds until the freeze is lifted. The combined value frozen across the 32 addresses is nearly $900,000. California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a crypto licensing bill into law. The digital financial assets law faced heavy industry criticism but was passed more than a year ago. It requires California's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation to create a regulatory framework for crypto. It's set to take effect in July 2025. The FTX bankruptcy estate has apparently staked millions of dollars worth of ether and Solana over the weekend, nearly 6 million sold worth 100 and $22 million and just over 24,000 E worth $30 million have been staked in separate transactions. This comes as the criminal trial against the founder of FTX Saman and Fried begins its third week. That's a wrap for coin desk daily. Get more updates on coin desk dot com and we'll see you next time."

        "title": "Fake Headlines Send Bitcoin Prices on Wild Swings - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nJoining us now is James Safer, a Bloomberg Intelligence and Kailey Leinz, co-host of Bloomberg Crypto. The programme. That programme airs tomorrow on PM. By the way, every Tuesday at 1 p.m.. James, let's start off with you. How did this all happen? Did it roll from kind of the greyscale people familiar story into this? Yeah, I mean, it all happened literally from a tweet and it ripped it rip through everything. A bunch of sources started citing that it was approved. And then you saw a whole bunch of like prominent crypto and financial people tweeting that it was approved 15 minutes after the initial tweet went out. And even right around, Eric and I both sent out separate tweets saying that we thought this was fake news. And I basically spent ten plus minutes scouring S.E.C. websites, everything I could find that would cram plus minutes. Don't tell yourself now, James. Yeah, well, I was watching the Bitcoin price rip up to $30,000 and I was like, I'm pretty sure this is fake, but I was like, I'm not going to tweet this is fake and say this is fake publicly unless I could have some sort of confirmation because there was a lot of news. Right. The FCC the FCC had a deadline on Friday to file for an en banc and virtually an appeal in the great skip. I'm so we're going to get more information this week. So it wouldn't have been completely insane, but it was very unlikely in my view. Okay. So you spent 10 minutes looking through the SEC filings, Kelly. You actually also look through the SEC filings. When do you think we're actually going to get the news? Well, that is the million dollar question, Alex. Of course, the SEC has deferred making decisions on a multitude of these filings recently. So we'll see. They're facing some deadlines coming up. I believe our deadline is in January. And yet it does seem like the pressure may be building given this deadline. They just Speights and grayscale that James was talking about. They decided not to appeal that ruling, which of course found that they were arbitrary and capricious in denying Grayscale's attempt to convert GBTC into an ETF. So it feels like it might be kind of crunch time. But of course we know that Gary Gensler, the SEC more broadly, has raised a lot of concern about market manipulation and fraud in the crypto markets. That really has been their reasoning why they haven't approved spot Bitcoin products in the past. We'll see if it changes going forward in the future and frankly, what it may make a material difference at all to this market given we have seen some whipsaw in Bitcoin. We certainly saw it this morning off of this news. So clearly there is still some anticipation and excitement there. But also given what we've seen with interest Ether future ETF, which really hasn't brought with it much flow or excitement, it remains to be seen what actually approval might mean for the crypto market. Yeah, absolutely. I was going to say, Kelly, it really is just a $1 million question, maybe $2 million. James, what do we know about, you know, judging from the price action as this fake news rips through the market, can you tell us anything about what you expect for when we do get an approved ETF flows and PRICE Yes. So Erik and I are very much on record that we think it's going to happen by that January deadline that that Kelly mentioned. But also we don't know what the next steps are for grayscale. So we could see something happen before that. If the SEC is forced to issue some sort of either deny for different reasons or approve before that January deadline. So we're we're very much like kind of waiting to see what happens. This was kind of like a dry run for like what's going to happen if these things actually do get approved. I mean, that was a rip. I mean, Eric said rip on live TV like that. It really was kind of a very aggressive. So a lot of people obviously weren't expecting it. Maybe more people will be ready for it in case it does happen the way we expect it to. But it basically gave traders a playbook of like what's going to happen if this approval does happen. Just signals that maybe the market isn't really ready for it. The other thing is we expect a bunch of these to go at the same time, the way the ether futures went, right, that a whole bunch of ether futures ETFs went live on the same day. We think the same thing is going to happen with these spot Bitcoin ETFs. So what happens as far as flows? But we think it'll be significant. It's going to be a meaningful launch and there's likely to be a lot of money at play here."

        "title": "SBF and Caroline Ellison conspired to keep Bitcoin under $20K, but did it work? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On Oct. 11, Caroline Ellison, former head of the now-defunct Alameda Research, informed a United States court that she received instructions from FTX co-founder and CEO Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried to sell Bitcoin (BTC) if its price remained above $20,000.\n\nThis admission came as a shock to the entire crypto industry, but the two conspiring to suppress BTC\u2019s price, versus actually doing it, are two different things.\n\nWhile there are no details available regarding the size and timing of these trades, the timeframe likely falls between September and October 2022, just weeks before Alameda and FTX collapsed.\n\nDetermining whether Alameda effectively acted to suppress Bitcoin\u2019s price below $20,000, as alleged by some analysts and traders, is challenging, if not impossible. Nevertheless, it is possible to assess the significance of FTX\u2019s Bitcoin holdings in comparison to other exchanges and the total trading volume.\n\nLook at the Bitcoin wallets\n\nCurrently, the only reliable publicly available information pertains to the BTC wallets that previously constituted the exchange\u2019s reserves, amounting to less than 47,000 BTC by September 2022, according to Glassnode data. It\u2019s possible that Alameda Research held other addresses directly, but given the substantial debt of the trading company, it\u2019s unlikely they had any liquid reserves.\n\nOne should not assume that FTX used its entire stack of Bitcoin from users since the exchange continued processing client withdrawals until its final day on Nov. 8, 2022. Moving these assets abruptly would have aroused suspicion, potentially accelerating their insolvency. Nevertheless, it\u2019s worthwhile to investigate the significance of FTX volumes and holdings.\n\nCoinbase vs. FTX monthly spot Bitcoin volume, USD. Source: CoinMetrics\n\nAs of July 2022, FTX reported a spot Bitcoin volume of $30 billion, equivalent to $1 billion per day on average. However, relying on these numbers is not advisable, given the exchange\u2019s history of data manipulation, as demonstrated by their falsified insurance fund calculation methodology.\n\nAssuming the sales mentioned by Ellison occurred on FTX, a 4,000-BTC order, valued at $80 million at the time, would represent only 8% of the exchange\u2019s average daily volume. Furthermore, when considering the total Bitcoin volume from major exchanges, Alameda\u2019s speculated order size becomes even more inconsequential.\n\nAccording to Messari\u2019s \u201creal volume\u201d methodology, which excludes wash trading, the aggregate Bitcoin volume was below $3.5 billion per day between September and October 2022. Even if Alameda attempted to sell 25% of their 47,000 BTC holdings in a single day, that $240 million would represent only 7% of the daily volume across major exchanges.\n\nFor comparison, in April 2022, MicroStrategy announced the acquisition of 4,167 BTC at an average price of $45,714, totaling $190 million. This likely occurred in late March, with Bitcoin\u2019s price increasing by 6%, from $44,580 to $47,270.\n\nBitcoin price index (USD), March\u2013April 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nTwo notable aspects of the price action during MicroStrategy\u2019s acquisition stand out. First, the price dropped below $46,000 on the same day as the official announcement on April 5, 2022. More importantly, the $48,000 peak appears to correspond to the levels where MicroStrategy completed its execution, resulting in the $45,714 average price.\n\nHowever, when examining the broader picture, Bitcoin was trading around $39,500 in the two weeks leading up to MicroStrategy\u2019s activity and decreased to $39,500 a few weeks later. There is no reason to believe that a single entity could effectively suppress the price for longer than a week, whether it\u2019s Tesla unloading $936 million worth of Bitcoin or Alameda liquidating FTX clients\u2019 deposits.\n\nTo provide some context, Binance held 623,000 BTC in reserves in August 2022, while Coinbase had nearly 690,000 BTC. These two exchanges combined held almost 28 times more Bitcoin than FTX. This fact underscores the limited impact of SBF and Caroline\u2019s venture in terms of effective firepower.\n\nIn essence, there may have been a few days where Alameda exerted pressure successfully, causing their sales to suppress Bitcoin\u2019s price below $20,000. However, considering their reserves and the price action of similarly sized orders, the event was unlikely to be significant when analyzing a period longer than a month.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency stocks surged after a sudden rise in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices. The rising cryptocurrency values sent Grayscale Bitcoin (NASDAQ:GBTC) blasting up over 6% in Monday afternoon\u2019s trading, and it was hardly alone. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) was up fractionally, and Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) added significantly. Meanwhile, both Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) and WisdomTree (NYSE:WT) gained over 2% in Monday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nThe biggest reason for the gains was that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), having fought tooth and nail against a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for years now, is pretty much out of ammunition in this fight and will ultimately have to approve its existence. That alone was enough to offer hope to the diamond-handed HODLer everywhere, but some analysts caution that the rise will not be linear. There will still be \u201cspeed bumps\u201d along the way, some note.\n\nMeanwhile, it doesn\u2019t hurt matters that Bitcoin is being increasingly regarded as a \u201csafe haven\u201d trade. Some analysts here point to Bitcoin\u2019s built-in scarcity mechanisms, as well as the inherent difficulty of trying to manipulate pricing on Bitcoin the way it can be done for silver and gold trading. Market manipulation of precious metals has long been a concern of gold bugs, and Bitcoin simply doesn\u2019t have that issue. One even believed that built-in scarcity plus the resistance to manipulation would make Bitcoin more likely to outpace gold in the next 10 years.\n\nWhich Cryptocurrency Stock is a Good Investment?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, MSTR stock is currently the leader in terms of Wall Street expectations. This Moderate Buy-rated stock has a price target of $433.25, which means an upside potential of 34.25%. Meanwhile, COIN stock offers the least upside, as it offers 15.38% upside potential thanks to its average price target of $85.50.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "With recession fears swelling again, investors seeking a safe place to put their assets should be interested in bitcoin , says Bernstein. The cryptocurrency, which has grown in popularity among institutions for its \"digital gold\" qualities, has an \"enviable return record\" versus physical gold, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said in a note Monday. \"Bitcoin's hard money properties makes it an attractive 'safe haven' asset. Since its inception, bitcoin has consistently outperformed gold,\" he wrote. \"Bitcoin's inflation today at 1.8% is similar to Gold's inflation, but what bitcoin skeptics miss is that every four years, bitcoin's inflation halves, and bitcoin is still at a fairly early stage of institutional adoption i.e more inflows as supply become more scarce, leading to its exponential move.\" Chhugani is referring to bitcoin's halving event, which takes place every four years when the reward for mining bitcoin is cut in half, as designed in the Bitcoin code, to reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency. Historically, it has set the stage for new bull runs, and the next one is expected to come in May 2024. Bitcoin is up about 150% over the past three years, even with a 60% drawdown in 2022, while gold has been flat, Chhugani noted. Going back five years, bitcoin has outperformed gold 5x. On top of its outperformance, Bernstein notes that bitcoin is also in the early stages of institutional adoption, which will be helped by the approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. \"The Bitcoin ETF would make bitcoin accessible in broker accounts [and] well integrated with private banks and wealth managers/advisors,\" Chhugani said. \"The early stages of bitcoin adoption, naturally, makes it more attractive [than] gold, with bitcoin market cap at less than 5% of Gold's market value (of above ground reserves).\" Bernstein's comments come about a week after legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC that bitcoin is looking more attractive as an investment with the economy \"more likely than not\" going into a recession. Jefferies also recently said bitcoin is a \"critical hedge\" against currency debasement and the return of inflation. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

However, this was soon shown to be false by other journalists and channels, including BlackRock itself.\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin\u2019s price shot up by around 10% and crossed the $29,300-mark before slipping back down to around $28,100.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\n\u201cWe apologize for a tweet that led to the dissemination of inaccurate information regarding the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF. An internal investigation is currently underway. We are committed to transparency and will share the findings of the investigation with the public once it is concluded within 3 hours,\u201d posted Cointelegraph on X on Monday.\n\nIn an update, Cointelegraph said that the news lead came from an \u201cunconfirmed screenshot posted by an X user who claimed it was from the Bloomberg Terminal.\u201d The publication also said its social media process had been violated when the report was posted to X without an editor\u2019s confirmation. However, an article had not been published with the news. Cointelegraph has about 1.9 million followers on X.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF is a product many crypto traders are eagerly waiting for. This would encourage traditional and institutional investors to enter the crypto market in a more regulated manner, with the support of a licensed company, rather than going through riskier decentralised platforms. Multiple applications for these spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently pending, as the SEC is wary of the crypto market as a whole.\n\n\u201cCareful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC,\u201d said the financial regulator on X on Tuesday.\n\nCryptocurrency prices are extremely volatile.

        "content": "Fact: The US Securities and Exchange Commission Will Not Appeal the Grayscale (GBTC) ETF Ruling\n\nA Bitcoin Trust is a financial vehicle where investors pool their funds to buy and hold Bitcoin. Bitcoin Trusts operate like a traditional investment and are traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) stock exchange. Bitcoin Trusts indirectly own Bitcoin through the trust\u2019s holdings.\n\nConversely, a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin and is traded on stock exchanges, just like a stock. ETF investors buy shares of the fund, which in turn owns Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs are more optimal because they directly own Bitcoin, and offer investors more liquidity and flexibility than Bitcoin Trusts.\n\nGrayscale runs the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin Trust. However, Grayscale has been working to clear the \u201cred tape\u201d of switching from a Bitcoin Trust to an ETF for the past two years. Because the SEC did not act before the Friday deadline, the SEC will not appeal an August court loss over Grayscale\u2019s ETF conversion application. In a statement to CoinDesk, a Grayscale spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC\u2019s approval, and we look forward to sharing more information as soon as practicable.\u201d\n\nFiction: The SEC Approved Blackrock\u2019s (BLK) Bitcoin ETF\n\nEarly Monday morning, CoinTelegraph, one of crypto\u2019s most followed news sites, tweeted news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had approved Blackrock\u2019s Ishares spot Bitcoin ETF. As a result, Bitcoin spiked to two-month highs and neared the psychologically important $30,000 level before reversing. However, there was one major problem \u2013 the tweet was a hoax. A few hours after sending Bitcoin soaring, CoinTelegraph retracted its tweet and said it was investigating why false news was spread. Meanwhile, Blackrock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, confirmed that the headline was false and said the Bitcoin application is still under review by the SEC.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nFact: Blackrock\u2019s ETF Approval is a Matter of \u201cWhen\u201d, Not \u201cIf\u201d\n\nThe SEC is reeling from several crypto-related court losses in the US. While a Blackrock ETF is not a 100% lock, it\u2019s pretty close. History shows that Blackrock\u2019s ETF approval-to-loss ratio is more than 500-to-1. I like those odds.\n\nWinners\n\nClearly, the market wants a Bitcoin ETF. Conspicuously, even though the Blackrock news turned out to be false (or premature), Bitcoin rose strongly on heavy turnover Monday \u2013 a sign of significant demand. GBTC was the day\u2019s big winner and increased more than 8.5% - more than Bitcoin rose.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nShould ETFs start to be approved in the coming months, winners include Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR), andRiot Platforms (RIOT). COIN will benefit because it is the custodian exchange for nearly every Bitcoin ETF. MSTR will benefit because of its massive Bitcoin holdings. RIOT, a Bitcoin miner, will benefit from further adoption.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA flurry of headlines sparked the price of Bitcoin on Monday. If a Bitcoin ETF is approved, it would be massively bullish. However, what headlines are fact and which are fiction?\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading sharply higher on Tuesday in Asia but the gains soon eased early morning. A false report of a spot ETF approval was posted on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. However, the gains were trimmed as the clarity emerged and the report was deleted.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted sharp gains in the early morning as the last crypto token surged about 4 per cent to once again top 28,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, also gained about 2 per cent but remained below $1600-level. Altcoins were also trading with decent gains in the early morning.\n\n\n\nYesterday was a very interesting day to trade. Bitcoin saw a 70-day high in price. This happened alongside a massive $65 million worth of liquidation in close to 15 minutes as a major crypto news publisher CoinTelegraph reported that the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF has been approved by the SEC, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager at CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"However, shortly after, Blackrock clarified that their application is still under review,\" he said. \"The series of events makes one thing clear\u2014a real spot Bitcoin ETF approval is highly likely to lead to an unprecedented rally. Currently, Bitcoin still looks bullish in charts,\" he added.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, the majority of top crypto tokens were trading with big gains on Tuesday. Solana surged about 9 per cent, while Polygon was trading 3 per cent higher. Tron, Litecoin and BNB added 2 per cent each. Among the losers, only Polkadot and USD Coin were seen in red.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, jumping to $1.09 trillion-mark, as it surged as much as three per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes zoomed more than 220 per cent to $62.5billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nSolana, an open-source project that leverages the unrestricted nature of blockchain technology, offers decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions. Although the project's conception and early development date back to 2017, Solana was formally introduced in March 2020 under the stewardship of the Solana Foundation, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SOL/USDT chart made a single day jump of nearly 7 per cent, reclaiming its position above the $24 level. On the daily time-frame, the SOL/USDT chart has just broken above the triangle pattern with its daily buying volumes almost doubling. The next resistance is expected at 27.5 USDT and an immediate support is expected at 20.2 USDT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "\u201cIf it\u2019s inflationary, you have more incentive to spend it. If it\u2019s deflationary you have more incentive to save it because in the future you may end up converting [your bitcoin] to fiat currencies when you need to spend.\u201d\n\nAnother crypto evangelist, Daniel Roberts, the co-founder of US-based and Nasdaq-listed bitcoin miner Iris Energy, said investors were kidding themselves if they believed cash was a safe or risk-free investment to hold.\n\nDaniel Roberts, co-founder and co-chief executive of Iris Energy. Michael Quelch\n\n\u201cFiat currencies are programmed to be debased,\u201d he told the summit.\n\n\u201cGovernments must keep printing now [due to fiscal imbalances and debt], if you\u2019ve got an 8 or 9 per cent return on your capital [as a sharemarket or property investor] all you\u2019ve done is preserve your wealth.\u201d\n\nMr Armstrong warned that emerging market currencies in Africa, the Asia Pacific and South America faced \u201clong tails\u201d of destruction due to reckless and corrupt governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBitcoin has an important role in feeding the moral imperative to replace the long tail of fiat currencies that are really abused the most in [emerging market] countries around the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of those currencies eroded the wealth of the poorest people in society. And it\u2019s a real tragic story where governments have abused that and it\u2019s basically like theft.\u201d\n\nSince its initial public offer at the peak of the cryptocurrency bubble in November 2021, Coinbase \u2013 as the largest crypto exchange in the US \u2013 has ridden a regulatory storm and crypto price rollercoaster, which saw it reach a valuation of more than $US100 billion at $US429.54 per share at the time of its float.\n\nThe stock has tumbled to $US73.43 per share since its float as the US Federal Reserve took interest rates on cash from 0.25 per cent in March 2022 to an upper bound of 5.5 per cent in July 2023.\n\nMr Armstrong said the revised policy settings in the US, among other strengths, meant he did not believe the US dollar was in danger of being displaced from its status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. However, bitcoin was acting as a \u201cballast against deficit spending\u201d by the US government.\n\nIn the US Mr Armstrong faces an ongoing legal battle after the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged Coinbase violated securities laws by operating as an unregistered broker and clearing agency for cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Bitcoin reversed an earlier gain of as much as 10% after BlackRock said that its application for an exchange-traded fund that invests directly in the cryptocurrency is still under review.\u201cThe iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF application is still under review by the SEC,\u201d a spokesperson said. Bitcoin was up about 3% to $28,000 as of 10:12am in New York on Monday after briefly jumping to $30,000.Speculation swirled on social media that BlackRock, which in June submitted an application for a spot-Bitcoin ETF, received a green-light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the first such product in the US. That spurred the surge in the largest coin, though Bitcoin quickly reversed the majority of those gains after the rumor was debunked.Still, the episode suggests that there remains a lot of excitement and hope for a spot-Bitcoin product in the US, which regulators have in the past refused to allow. They\u2019ve previously cited market manipulation, among other reasons, for not granting an endorsement. However, the incident also serves as a reminder that Bitcoin\u2019s price can easily be moved by gossip or hearsay.There are currently more than 10 filings for spot-Bitcoin ETFs, with industry heavyweights like BlackRock and Invesco being part of the race \u2014 which has some analysts guessing that the odds for approval may be greater this time around given their participation in the race.Another factor influencing analyst predictions on whether a spot-Bitcoin fund will soon be allowed to launch is Grayscale\u2019s win against the SEC as the crypto-asset-manager tries to convert its $16.7 billion Bitcoin Trust \u2014 known as GBTC \u2014 into an ETF. On Friday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission declined to appeal on earlier positive court ruling for Grayscale, which in the eyes of many analysts served as yet another positive step toward the approval process.\u201cThat was a good 30 minutes of fun and games,\u201d Teong Hng, CEO of crypto investment firm Satori Research, said of Monday\u2019s roundabout."

        "content": "Facility is already available in America and will be rolled out to Europe soon in response to customer demand\n\nCryptocurrencies have taken a bit of a hammering over the last couple of years, but many younger investors have built their wealth this way, and now Ferrari is letting them buy supercars using blockchain tech.\n\nFerrari dealers in the U.S. are already taking crypto payments and the service will be rolled out to Europe in early 2024, followed by other regions at a later date due to demand from wealthy clients, the brand\u2019s marketing boss told Reuters. Bitcoin and ether are both accepted by dealers, as is the stablecoin, USDC.\n\nCrypto doesn\u2019t exactly have a great reputation for stability, so Ferrari\u2019s chosen payment processor, BitPay, will immediately convert the digital currencies into traditional money to prevent dealers getting stung by price fluctuations. It\u2019s also BitPay\u2019s job to make sure the crypto payments aren\u2019t the proceeds of criminal activity or being used to launder money or evade taxes.\n\n\u201cThis will help us connect to people who are not necessarily our clients but might afford a Ferrari,\u201d Ferrari\u2019s Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer Enrico Galliera, told Reuters. \u201cPrices will not change, no fees, no surcharges if you pay through cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nRelated: Tesla Stops Accepting Bitcoin As Payment Due To Environmental Concerns\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an automaker has accepted crypto payments. Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin payments in 2021, but then reversed that decision citing concerns over the amount of fossil fuels used in Bitcoin mining. Ferrari\u2019s Galliera says that cryptocurrencies have increased efforts to reduce their carbon footprint though new software and by replacing fossil fuel-derived energy with renewables in the mining process, and claims that accepting digital currencies does not derail Ferrari\u2019s own green plans.\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Tesla could be about to take crypto payments again. Code was was spotted on Tesla\u2019s retail website suggesting that Bitcoin would be reinstated as a payment method."

        "title": "How Does The Stacks Layer-2 Technology Enhance The Functionality Of Bitcoin? - Dataconomy",
        "content": "The challenge of the blockchain trilemma remains a prominent issue within the cryptocurrency field, with even Bitcoin \u2013 renowned for its decentralization and security \u2013 facing this same predicament. Although Bitcoin has set the precedent for all crypto endeavors, its limited scalability renders the BTC blockchain unfeasible for Web3 applications.\n\nBy implementing a new layer to Bitcoin, Stacks endeavors to alleviate this situation and present an alternative resolution. Dive into the world of Stacks Layer-2 technology and discover how it synergizes with Bitcoin in our article. We\u2019ll also introduce you to Quantumator, an online trading platform that\u2019s reshaping the landscape.\n\nWhat is Stacks?\n\nRather than immediately discussing Stacks, it may be beneficial to first examine the differences between Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains. The former, exemplified by the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, function as primary blockchains that prioritize robust security and decentralization. However, due to their scaling limitations, these blockchains struggle with low throughput, constituting a so-called blockchain trilemma. Only after fully grasping these distinctions can we move on to exploring Stacks.\n\nAs a result, Layer 2 blockchains are now a solution to improve the scaling as well as efficiency of Layer one networks. These blockchains act as one more layer over the principal blockchains and help with transactions. Ethereum is a level 1 blockchain, for example, and Polygon offers Layer 2 options. Layer two solutions are much less widespread for Bitcoin as compared to Ethereum.\n\nStacks is one of many platforms that developed a layering process for Bitcoin. It possesses numerous parallels with Layer Two alternatives, though the significant difference is in utilizing BTC as an anchor while working along with it. Stacks allow the inclusion of smart contracts to the blockchain of BTC, enabling possibilities for distributed programs (DApps) on the system. The stack tokens (STX) enhance the protection of the system as well as leverage Bitcoin\u2019s security functions.\n\nHow does Stacks function?\n\nThe blockchain of Stacks works utilizing the Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus method, enabling it to link with the Bitcoin community. The PoX system is derived from the Proof of Burn (PoB), in which miners add blocks on the chain by burning up their tokens to be able to get bonuses through the system. In much the same manner, PoX verifies blocks by transferring tokens rather than burning crypto coins. Individuals associated with verifying the blockchain L2 shift their tokens to a different participant\u2019s address. These transactions take place with the indigenous tokens of L1 inside the L1 network.\n\nTransactions play an important role in confirming new blocks in this method. L2 \u2013 blockchains are meant to check the status of the L1 \u2013 system every twenty-four hours and validate each transaction between L2 \u2013 users. In this procedure, most L2 members get rewards for supplying indigenous tokens to L2.\n\nWhat is the difference between Stacks and Ethereum?\n\nAlthough they work similarly, there are two key differences between Stacks and Ethereum.\n\nEfficiency and Security\n\nStacks is founded upon the blockchain security of BTC, which possesses a good history of protection. Stacks utilizes methods such as macroblocks as well as subnets to boost its effectiveness while keeping the security of BTC.\n\nOn the flip side, Ethereum is renowned for its secureness and it is favored by programmers across the globe. Ethereum\u2019s native throughput is restricted, however, it may be enhanced by utilizing scaling alternatives to support further transactions without compromising on efficiency or security.\n\nTools for developers\n\nEthereum is famous for its developer-friendly environment due to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as well as the commonly used Solidity programming words. Stacks, however, provides a helpful development ecosystem that includes resources and tools that could be utilized to learn from.\n\nStacks\u2019 advanced contract language, Clarity, is intended to be simpler to study as well as use, while simultaneously prioritizing effectiveness as well as protection.\n\nFeatured image credit: Traxer/Unsplash."

        "content": "There's the old maxim 'crime doesn't pay', and most of the time this is absolutely correct.\n\nOne Irish drug dealer reckoned he was the exception to this rule, until a cleaner ended up losing him $57 million in bitcoin.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\nAdvert 10\n\nClifton Collins, from Crumlin, Dublin, had made a fortune worth around $56.7 million dollars from selling cannabis. That's a lot of cannabis.\n\nHiding that much money from the authorities is no mean feat. It's not like you can just walk into a high street bank and stick it all in an ISA.\n\nAs a way round this, Collins had transferred the money into Bitcoin, buying it between 2011 and 2012.\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin lend themselves well to criminal activity, as they effectively belong to whoever has access to them with fewer measures to trace them.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nThis makes them much easier to conceal than transactions in regular currency.\n\nHe had amassed a fortune worth millions in Bitcoin. Credit: Westend61 / Getty\n\nThere's just one problem. In order to have your Bitcoin, you have to be able to access whatever hard drive it has been placed on.\n\nIf you can't do that, you're out of luck. And in Collins' case, he couldn't just ring up the help desk and get sent a password reminder by email.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nUnfortunately for the dealer, his entire multi-million dollar fortune was lost, after a cleaner threw out the access codes.\n\nImagine that at the end of Breaking Bad, Walter White loses the $80 million of drug money, because he lost his passwords. Not quite the same as as burying it in the desert.\n\nWhen the police caught up with Collins in 2017, Ireland's Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) tried to access the accounts, but also found themselves locked out of the multi-million dollar fortune.\n\nSo where are the access codes? Well, Collins had concealed them inside a fishing rod in his home.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nHe made his money selling cannabis (stock image). Credit: Yuri Kriventsoff / Getty\n\nIn a twist of fate even The Godfather himself couldn't anticipate, a cleaner hired by Collins' landlord to clear out his flat threw out the rod containing the codes, thinking it was trash.\n\nThe rod has now been incinerated, and with it any hopes that the authorities can access the money.\n\nCollins had transferred the funds into 12 different accounts, and then printed out the passwords for them onto a piece of paper, which was rolled up inside the fishing rod. As innocuous hiding places go, it makes a lot of sense.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nAs for losing the money, Collins said he considers it to be a punishment for his own stupidity.\n\nBefore cannabis, Collins was a renowned beekeeper who won awards for his honey. But he soon turned his attention to something a bit more potent than honey.\n\nOther bitcoin accounts valued at around $1.6 million have been seized, but the main stash, the largest in CAB history, remains locked away."
