        "title": "El Salvador Adopted Bitcoin as an Official Currency; Salvadorans Mostly Shrugged - Yale Insights",
        "content": "Central banks in more than 100 countries around the world are considering adopting digital currencies to increase financial inclusion and the efficiency of payments for their populations; some countries\u2014including the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria\u2014have already launched such currencies.\n\nEl Salvador took a different path toward digital payments. In 2021, in order to promote financial inclusion and job creation and facilitate remittances, it became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. At the same time, the country launched Chivo Wallet, an app that offers many of the same benefits as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), including accessibility and the ability to pay peers and firms and make deposits and withdrawals both in U.S. dollars (the country\u2019s official currency) and in Bitcoin. But Bitcoin, of course, is different than a CBDC in many ways\u2014not least of which is that its value is not backed by a central bank.\n\nBecause of the interest in digital payment systems around the world, El Salvador\u2019s experience could be informative. But the country has been tight-lipped about its experience, much to the chagrin of the International Monetary Fund. Yale SOM\u2019s David Argente and Diana Van Patten and their co-author Fernando Alvarez of the University of Chicago developed a survey to get more information directly from people in El Salvador and have written a new paper, published in Science magazine, that analyzes Salvadorans\u2019 use of Bitcoin and Chivo Wallet.\n\nThey find that neither Bitcoin nor the app are getting much use, despite a battery of incentives put in place, an indication that governments may face an uphill battle in convincing their citizens to adopt new payment technologies in a way that furthers financial efficiency and inclusion.\n\n\u201cThis is as good as it gets for an experiment\u201d about the launch of a new digital currency, Argente explains. \u201cIt was a beautiful chance to study theories that we\u2019ve never had a chance to test.\u201d\n\nMuch of the publicly available information about the use of Bitcoin and Chivo Wallet in El Salvador has come in tweets by the country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele. Argente, Van Patten, and Alvarez did not receive responses to their requests for information from the government, so they decided to take their questions to Salvadorans themselves. In February 2022, in partnership with the research firm CID Gallup, they conducted an in-person survey of 1,800 representative households in the country to ask about people\u2019s knowledge and use of Chivo Wallet. They then hired a firm to analyze blockchain data of transactions involving the app to validate their findings.\n\nThe researchers were impressed by how many people were aware of and downloaded the app: almost 68 percent of potential users knew about Chivo Wallet; 78 percent of that group at least tried to download it. But from there, the numbers declined drastically. Despite incentives by the government\u2014including a $30 Bitcoin bonus, a discount on gas when bought with the Chivo Wallet, and the elimination of certain transactional fees\u2014almost 20% of people who downloaded the app hadn\u2019t used their bonus by the time of the survey and most people who spent their bonus didn\u2019t continue to use the app after doing so.\n\nFurther, more than 20% of people surveyed knew about the app but did not try to download it. The authors had expected that people might be skeptical of Bitcoin because of the volatility (and therefore risk) of cryptocurrencies in general. But instead, people shared that they did not trust the app or Bitcoin because they are not anonymous, as cash is. The latter explains why Chivo Wallet was not even used to conduct transactions in dollars. These are important findings for policymakers looking to adopt digital currencies in their own countries: like Chivo Wallet, any digital currency will require governments to keep a record of users and their transactions; if people don\u2019t trust the government or the technology, they won\u2019t use it.\n\nLooking for more insights?

If a lack of trust leads to a lack of adoption, that undermines the network effects that make digital technologies more useful. \u201cThat\u2019s something any government should keep in mind.\u201d\n\nThe authors\u2019 analysis of data on the blockchain\u2014the digital public ledger where Bitcoin transactions are typically captured\u2014validate their survey findings. Many wallets, including Chivo Wallet, are custodial, meaning they do not verify their transactions on the blockchain. But the authors could see certain transactions, including Bitcoin transfers between Chivo Wallet and other crypto wallets. The blockchain data was in line with the authors\u2019 survey results: transactions peaked around the time of the country\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin and then decreased significantly.\n\nThe paper is already having an impact: the IMF and United Nations have asked for more information about the authors\u2019 findings, as have entrepreneurs seeking to develop fintech products and people who follow developments in cryptocurrencies.\n\nArgente, Van Patten, and Alvarez, who also are collaborating on research into the adoption of a digital payment system in Costa Rica, where Van Patten grew up, plan to continue their work in this area.\n\nArgente says he is fascinated by the study of payment systems. \u201cThe promise of financial inclusion can be fulfilled if we figure out a way to provide technologies to people in a way that they can actually adopt them,\u201d he says."

        "content": "A German programmer who is accused of running an illegal movie streaming site more than a decade ago transferred $2.17 billion worth of Bitcoin to the authorities to repay at least some of the money he had made illegally, the police said on Tuesday. The transfer required the man to use his unique Bitcoin credentials to hand over the funds.\n\n\u201cThis is the most extensive seizure of Bitcoins by law enforcement in the Federal Republic of Germany to date,\u201d said Kay Anders, a spokesman for the Saxony state police. The money will remain in the authorities\u2019 Bitcoin account until a court can figure out what to do with it, Mr. Anders added.\n\nThe man, identified only as a 40-year-old German citizen, and his business partner are under investigation on allegations that they ran what was once the country\u2019s most successful illegal video-sharing site.\n\nIn its heyday, from 2008 to 2013, the site, movie2k.to, had tens of thousands of movies in a host of languages available for download. Users from around the world visited the site, making it among the 25 most-visited websites in Germany, according to news reports at the time. After the authorities shut it down in 2013, several sites with similar names opened to fill the void."

These are questions many people have asked at one point or another, especially when the value of this digital currency starts to surge.\n\nThis guide will provide an overview of Bitcoin for beginners with the goal of answering all your burning questions. Also, learn where to invest in Bitcoin when you\u2019re ready and how to securely store your crypto for the long run.\n\nVault\u2019s Viewpoint on Bitcoin: BTC Meaning\n\nOriginally founded by an anonymous developer named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC) is the most widely used and popular cryptocurrency in circulation today.\n\nNew Bitcoins are still being created through a complex mining process, but only until the predetermined maximum of 21 million Bitcoin has been reached.\n\nBitcoin transactions are recorded on a ledger or \u201cblockchain,\u201d which keeps track of ownership as peer-to-peer transactions are made.\n\nYou can invest in Bitcoin through a number of crypto exchanges, but you\u2019ll want to set up a safe place to store your crypto for the long haul.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the most prominent and widely used digital currency available today, alongside other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT) and XRP (XRP). This virtual currency was created for the purpose of peer-to-peer money transfers that are decentralized, meaning central banks and other authorities are not involved in the process.\n\nSince BTC is an open-source project, bitcoins are brought to fruition, or \u201cmined,\u201d through a complex mining process that anyone can participate in. All Bitcoins created are recorded on a blockchain, which serves as a ledger and also records transactions made with the currency. There are currently around 19 million BTC created and in circulation, and a finite supply of 21 million BTC is the predetermined limit on this currency.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin can increase or decrease based on supply and demand similar to other investments. This means investors can drive up the price of Bitcoin by investing in coins at higher and higher prices, but that prices can drop just as quickly when demand falls. This is ultimately why the price of a single Bitcoin surged to a high of around $68,000 in November of 2021, only to drop below $17,000 just a year later. BTC price has been climbing ever since then, however, and a single coin is currently worth over $40,000.\n\nWhile individual investors can purchase an entire Bitcoin at a time, you can also invest in fractions of Bitcoin in nearly any dollar amount. Most people buy BTC and other cryptocurrencies on a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Kraken, then move their digital assets to a crypto wallet for long-term security.\n\nBitcoin Pros and Cons\n\nBitcoin may be a confusing concept for some, but it can help to think of Bitcoin and other crypto as a new kind of money that isn\u2019t managed by the government or a central bank.\n\nThere are many advantages and disadvantages that come with buying and holding BTC, however, and you should know about them before you get started investing in crypto.\n\nBitcoin Pros Bitcoin Cons Potential to build wealth through regular investment Highly volatile as an investment Separation from government authority Lack of government oversight Eventual scarcity Not widely used for payments (yet) Accessibility and liquidity Environmental concerns Cost-efficient way to send and receive money Potential for fraud Privacy Not protected by government insurance products\n\nBitcoin Pros\n\nPotential to build wealth through regular investment: Early Bitcoin investors who have stood their ground and held onto this asset are likely glad they did. Even now, today\u2019s price for a single Bitcoin is down almost a third from the all-time high in November 2021.\n\nEarly Bitcoin investors who have stood their ground and held onto this asset are likely glad they did.

Privacy: While all Bitcoin transactions are stored and publicly available on the blockchain, stored information is limited to Bitcoin addresses. This means Bitcoin transactions may not be able to be traced back to a person\u2019s real name or other personal information.\n\nBitcoin Cons\n\nHighly volatile as an investment: The price of Bitcoin has been all over the place over the last decade, and no one knows what the future holds. This means you\u2019ll want to be careful about investing and never buy more Bitcoin than you can afford to lose.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been all over the place over the last decade, and no one knows what the future holds.

Not protected by government insurance products: Where money kept in a bank account is typically protected FDIC insurance or NCUA insurance, crypto doesn\u2019t have these government protections. Bitcoin and other digital currencies also come without Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance that protects money invested in traditional investment accounts (up to limits of $500,000, including a $250,000 limit for cash).\n\nHow to Invest in Bitcoin\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin is easy, but you\u2019ll have to figure out where you want to invest before you get started. These steps can help you start building a crypto portfolio with BTC and other digital currencies:\n\nStep 1: Choose a crypto exchange. Compare all the best crypto exchanges today and keep in mind that not all of them support Bitcoin. Look for an exchange that has an easy-to-use interface, enhanced security features and low starting balance requirements if you\u2019re a beginning investor. Some popular crypto exchanges to consider include Coinbase, Kraken and Crypto.com.\n\nCompare all the best crypto exchanges today and keep in mind that not all of them support Bitcoin.

Remember that you can buy fractions of Bitcoin at one time based on your goals.\n\nWhere to Store Bitcoin\n\nOnce you buy Bitcoin, you\u2019ll want to look for a place to keep it for long-term storage. After all, crypto exchanges are custodial, meaning they maintain control over your private keys. By moving your BTC to a crypto wallet, you can take power of your private keys and enjoy enhanced security for your digital assets.\n\nAs you look for the best crypto wallet, keep in mind that most cryptocurrency wallets fall into one of two categories:\n\nHot wallets: Hot wallets are crypto wallets that are connected to the internet and accessed digitally. You can use most hot wallets through a desktop, mobile application or web browser, although some hot wallets are only available through one or two of these means.\n\nHot wallets are crypto wallets that are connected to the internet and accessed digitally.

The lack of connectivity cold wallets have to the internet means many experts consider them to be the safest."

Bitcoin has fought back into the green for the year following steep losses after the long-awaited approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin closed out 2023 around the $42,000 level.

Bitcoin ETFs have been the biggest driver of the cryptocurrency's price action in recent weeks. Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF had disappointed some investors, who shook off those worries last week as they appeared to taper off."

Ether traded sideways Tuesday morning, but both cryptocurrencies were able to maintain their recovery path after a disappointing few weeks.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is now up around 3.3% over the month and ether (ETH) has gained 1% in the same time period.

The Nasdaq Composite also dipped, falling 0.4% in the first hour of trading.\n\nMonday\u2019s equity rally, analysts say, is largely thanks to a late-afternoon Treasury announcement that quarterly borrowing estimate by roughly $56 billion.\n\n\u201cWe know that was the key positive catalyst because stocks accelerated the rally during the final hour and sectors that benefit most from falling yields (small caps and tech) outperformed,\u201d Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said. \u201cSpecifically, the Treasury only needs to borrow $760 billion in Q1 compared to the previously estimated $816 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee will wrap its two-day policy-setting meeting Wednesday and futures markets Tuesday morning showed there is an overwhelming expectation that rates will stay where they are. Future market moves will depend on Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments and the statement from the Committee, Essaye said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s virtually zero chance of a rate cut at tomorrow\u2019s meeting,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat will make this meeting hawkish or dovish (and push stocks lower or extend the rally) will be whether the Fed hints that rate cuts are coming soon.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Its revenues in the third quarter of 2023 were $2.6 million, bringing its total revenue in last year\u2019s first three quarters to $8 million.\n\nGRIID CEO Trey Kelly said in a statement that the Nasdaq listing \u201cwill enhance our visibility, liquidity and broaden our investor base.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s newest public listing comes after GRIID secured a $525 million credit facility from Blockchain.com in 2021 and subsequently planned to list on the New York Stock Exchange \u2014 a move that never came to fruition.\n\nThe listing on Nasdaq also takes place before the upcoming bitcoin halving, slated for April. The event marks a reduction of per-block rewards for mining bitcoin from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price tracking ahead of the past 2 halvings \u2014 now 3 months to go\n\nDan Weiskopf, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), said that capital markets access is critical to growth heading into the halving.\n\nIn addition to top crypto holdings such as MicroStrategy and Coinbase, BLOK invests in bitcoin miners Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, Cleanspark and others.\n\n\u201cWe believe that companies in the private market are going to be at a disadvantage, so GRIID\u2019s decision to become public makes sense,\u201d Weiskopf told Blockworks. \u201cFor now the information available remains thin, so we are going to be watching on the sidelines as monthly and quarterly data is provided that builds the investor case.\u201d\n\nHow new, established public mining stocks are doing\n\nGRIID\u2019s listing comes about nine months after bitcoin miner Bitdeer began trading on Nasdaq last April via a (SPAC) merger with Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp.\n\nRead more: As SPAC IPOs have grown scarce, Bitdeer\u2019s success bucks a trend\n\nBitdeer\u2019s stock price is down about 7% so far in 2024 \u2014 a trend seen around the mining space.\n\nThe stock prices of larger competitors Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms were down about 19% and 25%, respectively, year to date, as of Monday morning.\n\nCore Scientific saw its price plummet when re-listed on the Nasdaq following its exit from bankruptcy.\n\nHut 8, which merged with US Bitcoin Corp. in November, has seen its stock price decline by about 31% so far in 2024. Rivals Cleanspark and Bitfarms have seen dips amounting to about 20% and 12%, respectively.\n\nCompass Point Research analysts said in a Jan. 19 research note that the decline in hash price from $0.12 to about $0.09 earlier this month contributed to the miner stock sell-off.\n\n\u201cWe expect continued volatility and potential weakness as investors price in further hash price declines as a result of the halving that is expected in mid-April, which we think will provide good buying opportunities,\u201d analysts Chase White and Joe Flynn wrote at the time.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is down about 3.5% year to date, as the asset\u2019s price has steadily declined following an initial surge after spot bitcoin ETFs began trading on Jan. 11.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen in the past five days after an earlier January slump.\n\nGrayscale outflows are showing signs of slowing down, predicted by some analysts to lessen the pressure from Bitcoin selling.\n\nBitcoin is bouncing back from a price slump this month, as the biggest driving force behind the cryptocurrency\u2019s price decline \u2014 outflows from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust \u2014 is decelerating.\n\nBitcoin recovers\n\nAfter falling about 20% from its $49,000 high earlier in January, Bitcoin has climbed 10% over the past five days.\n\nSince January 25, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has increased from $39,900 to about $43,400.\n\nThe recent slump has been linked to shifting market dynamics following the approval of 11 US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC is the largest of the approved offerings, with $20.8 billion in assets under management.\n\nAnalysts say factors including forced selling linked to the FTX estate and profitable investor strategies linked to GBTC\u2019s discount over the past two years have been big drivers of outflows.\n\nThose outflows \u2014 combined with overall bearish macroeconomic outlooks \u2014 have hit Bitcoin\u2019s price. Grayscale\u2019s ETF has seen about $5 billion in outflows since its launch on January 11.\n\nOn January 23, they peaked at $640 million a day.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nNow, Grayscale is averaging nearly $500 million daily, according to crypto analytics firm Kaiko. That\u2019s a 22% drop.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that trade volumes and outflows have showed signs of slowing, providing much-needed support\u201d for Bitcoin, Kaiko analysts wrote. \u201cWhile GBTC outflows have been expected and are partly compensated by inflows into the other newly launched spot ETFs, the impact on sentiment has been significant.\u201d\n\nGBTC Trade Volume and Outflows from Kaiko GBTC Trade Volume and Outflows from Kaiko (Kaiko/Kaiko)\n\nHowever, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted that daily GBTC outflows had dropped to $191.7 million on Monday.\n\nGBTC outflows have been partially offset by inflows into newly launched spot ETFs.\n\nTotal inflows to the newly issued US Bitcoin ETFs, meanwhile, swelled to $1.8 billion, according to data from digital asset manager CoinSshares.\n\nDownward pressure\n\nA lessening of GBTC\u2019s outflows would ease the \u201cdownward pressure\u201d on Bitcoin\u2019s price, JPMorgan said last week.\n\nAlthough Seyffart had a more nuanced take.\n\n\u201cETFs aren\u2019t THE market themselves,\u201d Seyffart tweeted. \u201cYes they\u2019re now a big slice of the pie but there\u2019s a lot more to the pie. Bitcoin ETF inflows can coincide with falling Bitcoin prices. Outflows can coincide with rising prices.\u201d\n\nThe rotation of funds from GBTC to newly issued ETFs raises questions about the nature of these inflows, whether they represent fresh capital entering the market or merely a shift between investment products, Kaiko said.\n\nA clearer picture is expected to form in the coming months as the funds mature, and as market makers show signs of entering.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is up 3.09% in the last 24 hours, trading at $43,503.\n\nEthereum is up 2% in the same period, at $2,311.\n\nAvalanche and Solana are down 6.1% and 8.8%, respectively.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip? Contact Seb at sebastian@dlnews.com.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that the average daily pace of GBTC outflows was $500 million, according to Kaiko\u2019s estimates and to show that it has now dropped below $200 million, per Seyffart\u2019s numbers."

        "content": "Most Popular Currencies in 2024\n\nMost of our research respondents bought crypto for the first time in 2020 and 2021, but fewer people joined the market since then due to poor performance in 2022. Blockchain adoption gained pace in 2020 and 2021 due to the impressive price performance on crypto exchanges driven by Bitcoin\u2019s third supply halving on May 11, 2020.\n\nSupply halvings are programmed into Bitcoin\u2019s software to occur every four years. As the name implies, the new supply of Bitcoin issued every ten minutes on average is cut in half. The 2020 halving cut new Bitcoin supplies from 12.5 BTC on each new block of transactions down to 6.25 BTC. The 2024 halving will cut new supplies to 3.125 BTC.\n\nAnother critical factor in 2020 and 2021 was an investor flight to Bitcoin and other deflationary blockchain currencies to hedge global inflation and geopolitical risk during the pandemic.\n\nAs the new supply of Bitcoin fell by 50 percent, the Federal Reserve increased the dollar supply by 20 percent in the first six months of 2020 for emergency monetary stimulus to contain the pandemic recession. As a result of supply and demand, Bitcoin appreciated rapidly against the dollar.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency launched in 2009 and maintains over 50 percent of the crypto market share by market capitalization, it remains the center of gravity for the going exchange rates of other cryptos such as Ethereum, Ripple, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu.\n\nWhat are the most popular cryptocurrencies in 2024?\n\nPercent of current owners holding various currencies, by year\n\nWhich cryptocurrencies do you currently own? 2024 2023 2022 Bitcoin (BTC) 76% 78% 77% Ethereum (ETH) 54% 58% 65% Dogecoin (DOGE) 26% Shiba Inu (SHIB) 12% 18% 19% Cardano (ADA) 12% 14% 19% U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC) 12% 10% 12% Stellar (XLM) 12% 14% 16% Solana (SOL) 11% 10% 11% Binance Coin (BNB) 10% 6% 6% Ripple (XRP) 9% 7% 6% Tether (USDT) 7% 5% 5% Avalanche (AVAX) 5% 6% 5% Terra (LUNA) 4% 2% 3% Other 9%\n\nIn our 2024 study, we found the rate of Bitcoin ownership has remained the popular favorite with around three in four crypto owners holding some BTC.\n\nWhile it remains the second most popular crypto, Ether (ETH) ownership rates have markedly fallen from 65 percent at the end of 2021 to 54 percent as we round out 2023. Because of widespread interest in the Ethereum Merge completed on Sept 15, 2022, to change how Ethereum secures ETH, many crypto adopters saw it as a good year to own Ether.\n\nBut competition since then from other smart contract cryptos like Solana (SOL) and Binance Coin (BNB) \u2014 plus stubbornly high transaction fees \u2014 have led to falling ETH ownership rates.\n\nMeanwhile, we found Ripple (XRP) ownership rates among crypto adopters bumped from seven percent to nine percent throughout 2023 after Ripple Labs prevailed in court against an SEC lawsuit. Despite a significant victory, the suit still hasn\u2019t concluded and goes to trial in April 2024.\n\nAmong current crypto owners, around 63 percent hope to obtain more cryptocurrency over the next year. Here are the top currencies they plan to invest in:"

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -7.25% \u2019s recent price appreciation could have been influenced by reduced open interest in bitcoin options at specific strike prices, according to an analyst.\n\n\"Much less open interest at the $40,000 level could be encouraging bitcoin's recent uptick, with comparably limited supply of delta from hedgers suddenly bereft of optionality to lean against at the big figure,\" crypto derivatives trader Gordon Grant told The Block.\n\nGrant said that following the expiration of end-of-month options on Friday, Jan. 26, there was a significant decrease in open interest for short-dated bitcoin derivatives, particularly options.\n\nThis is in contrast to the run-up to last Friday's options expiry, when \"an excess of local gamma could have constrained the price of the underlying asset after a short, sharp correction,\" Grant added.\n\nThe aggregated open interest of bitcoin options across major centralized derivatives exchanges was at a high of over $13 billion going into last Friday's expiry.\n\nHowever, total open interest fell by over $3 billion, to $9.88 billion after the expiry date, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\nBitcoin open interest focused on $50,000\n\nThe largest volume of bitcoin open interest for all upcoming expiry dates now consists of calls at a strike price of $50,000, suggesting bullish market sentiment, according to Deribit data.\n\nIn options trading, a call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a specified price before or on the expiration date.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe fact that there is a large cohort of call options at $50,000 suggests that a considerable number of traders could be anticipating that the price of bitcoin will rise above the $50,000 mark.\n\nMarket observers predicted price correction\n\nThe bitcoin price has held above the $42,000 mark over the past 24 hours, acting contrary to the predictions of some market observers.\n\nAccording to Grant, \"market analysts and leading crypto soothsayers had forecast a price correction to a low of around $33,600, but so far this has not materialized.\"\n\nLast week, BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes opined that the price of bitcoin would continue to decline. In a blog post, Hayes predicted a 30% correction for bitcoin, which reached approximately $48,000 immediately after the approval of multiple spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Jan. 10.\n\nAccording to Hayes, this correction could bring bitcoin down to the $33,600 level, ultimately establishing a new support zone between $30,000 and $35,000.\n\n\"A 30% correction from the ETF approval high of $48,000 is $33,600. Therefore, I believe bitcoin forms support between $30,000 to $35,000,\" Hayes wrote in the blog post.\n\nThe largest digital asset by market capitalization has traded mostly flat in the past 24 hours and was changing hands for $42,243 at 7:30 a.m. ET, according to The Block data."

        "title": "Investors Are Pouring Billions Into These 2 Bitcoin ETFs and Leaving the Rest Behind - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 new spot Bitcoin (BTC -4.63%) ETFs earlier this month; two stand out as clear winners among the group.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT -5.82%) from Blackrock (BLK -2.08%) was the first to reach $1 billion in assets under management less than one week after its launch. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC -5.85%) followed close behind, reaching the milestone the next day. Two weeks into the start of trading of this new breed of Bitcoin ETFs, the two leaders account for about 70% of all inflows.\n\nIn other words, the market is showing a clear preference for the Bitcoin ETFs from Blackrock and Fidelity over the competition. Should you follow the wisdom of the crowd, or are there better options?\n\nWhy size matters in Bitcoin ETFs\n\nNeither Blackrock nor Fidelity offer the lowest fees among the new Bitcoin ETFs. That title belongs to the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: BITB), which charges just 0.20% of assets under management. It's also waiving the fee for the first six months up to $1 billion in assets. But Blackrock and Fidelity are not too far behind, with expense ratios of 0.25% each. Both issuers are also offering generous fee waivers.\n\nImportantly, scale can play an important role in driving down costs for shareholders. Issuers can leverage certain operational expenses for an ETF, such as marketing spend. Additionally, bigger funds may be able to negotiate lower custodial fees for their Bitcoin holdings. (In the case of Fidelity, its crypto arm is handling the custody of the trust's holdings, so it has a lot of room to lower fees.) As a result, the biggest ETF issuers are often very competitive on price. Over time, both Blackrock and Fidelity may offer lower fees than the competition for their respective Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBut size matters for another reason as well. More funds flowing into (and out of) an ETF means the shares are more liquid. That provides investors with tighter bid-ask spreads and helps the ETF price track the net asset value of the fund's holdings. Even if you're not an active trader, the ability to buy an ETF that tracks the actual underlying assets very closely can ensure you're not paying an unnecessary premium to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nShould you follow the crowd?\n\nIf I were to invest in a Bitcoin ETF, it would either be the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund or the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Not only do the two issuers have the factors of scale working in their favor, but they also have long track records of providing low-cost ETFs and mutual funds for traditional asset classes, like stocks, bonds, and real estate investment trusts.\n\nThe ETFs are particularly interesting for anyone looking to add Bitcoin exposure to a retirement account, such as an IRA. While it's possible to invest directly in cryptocurrency with a self-directed IRA, those plans are expensive and the process of opening an account can be cumbersome. The simplicity of an ETF that tracks Bitcoin is a great option for those investors, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy either the Blackrock or Fidelity fund in that situation.\n\nBut for those investing in a regular brokerage account, they might consider a direct investment in Bitcoin itself. Holding Bitcoin instead of an ETF has several advantages. For one, you can transfer it to a wallet you control and use it for purchases. Second, you won't pay any fees just for holding Bitcoin.\n\nThat said, there are costs to purchase and sell Bitcoin. And those costs can be substantial on certain cryptocurrency exchanges. If you want a small amount of Bitcoin or will be buying a small amount at a time, you may end up paying less in fees with an ETF, despite the expense ratio.\n\nBuying the actual cryptocurrency itself will be a great option for some, but many will be better off with an ETF. And if you're going to buy a Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust or Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund are the most appealing options."

        "content": "The Hong Kong arm of Harvest Fund Management, a major Chinese asset manager, reportedly submitted an application for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Friday to the local financial regulator, as Hong Kong appears to get ready for its first batch of spot cryptocurrency ETFs soon.\n\nTencent News reported today that Harvest has submitted its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF to the Securities and Futures Commission, hoping to launch the city's first such ETF after the Lunar New Year holiday, which falls on Feb. 10 this year.\n\nHarvest and the SFC did not immediately respond to The Block\u2019s request for comment.\n\nEarlier this month, Livio Weng, chief operating officer of Hong Kong crypto exchange HashKey, said that around 10 fund companies have started looking into launching potential spot crypto ETFs in the city.\n\nHong Kong-based Venture Smart Financial Holdings Ltd. (VSFG) said it aims to launch its spot bitcoin ETF within the first quarter, according to Bloomberg.\n\nGrowing interest in stablecoins\n\nMeanwhile, with Hong Kong stepping up efforts to push for stablecoin rules, several companies \u2014 including Harvest Global Investments, RD Technologies and VSFG \u2014 have shown interest in stablecoin-related trials, Bloomberg reported today.\n\nThese firms are in discussions with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city\u2019s de facto central bank, about potential stablecoin trials, according to the report, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nSean Lee, senior advisor and head of stablecoin at VSFG, told The Block that the company expects the stablecoin sandbox process to commence in the first quarter, with the duration lasting through the first half of 2024.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\u201cVSFG is dedicated to supporting Hong Kong as an international virtual asset center, and our dedicated division, IDA, will be applying for sandbox inclusion along with our consortium partners to demonstrate the potential of programmable digital money while fulfilling prudential requirements,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAn HKMA spokesperson told The Block that the sandbox arrangement is intended for fiat-reference stablecoin (FRS) issuers \u201cwho have a genuine interest in and a reasonable plan on issuing FRS in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe HKMA is preparing for the launch of the sandbox and will announce relevant details in due course,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nHarvest and RD Technologies have yet to respond to The Block\u2019s inquiries.\n\nIn December, the HKMA said in a joint consultation paper with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau that a stablecoin issuer would be required to obtain a license from the authorities \u201cif it issues a stablecoin that references the value of one or more fiat currencies in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nEddie Yue, chief executive of the HKMA, said at the time that stablecoins could \u201cbecome the interface between traditional finance and the virtual asset market.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a scenario where stablecoins become one of the preferred payment options by the general public, we should reasonably expect further integration between the digital payment ecosystem and the real economy, and whether the stablecoin is indeed \u2018stable\u2019 will then become ever more important,\u201d Yue said in a December statement.\n\nUpdates: Added comments from the HKMA and VSFG"

        "content": "Experts Bet on $170K+ Bitcoin Price in Wake of 2024 Halving\n\nWith Bitcoin's next halving event just months away, optimism abounds that the cryptocurrency could reach dazzling new heights. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is among the crypto bulls forecasting eye-popping Bitcoin valuations in 2024 and beyond.\n\nScaramucci predicts Bitcoin will hit at least $170,000 in the 18 months following the halving in April when the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation gets cut in half. His projection is based on historical price performance, with Bitcoin tending to quadruple within that timeframe after previous halvings.\n\n\"The day that Bitcoin halves, multiply it by four and 18 months later and it\u2019s been uncanny that that\u2019s been the price of Bitcoin,\u201d said Scaramucci on a recent podcast.\n\nEven a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate of Bitcoin trading at $50,000 pre-halving would imply a $200,000 price tag post-halving, according to Scaramucci. Other optimistic forecasts come from Blockstream CEO Adam Back ($100,000+) and analysts at Standard Chartered Bank (also $100,000+).\n\nIn the long run, mega-bulls like Scaramucci see Bitcoin capturing half the market cap of gold, which would lift the cryptocurrency over $300,000 per coin. Scaramucci gave credit to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink for changing his once-negative stance on Bitcoin as digital gold."

With her fortune, she bought a million-dollar house in her home state of Maryland, a million-dollar condo in Dubai, a BMW, and some designer handbags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it all came crashing down, and on Monday (Jan. 29), Chunga pled guilty to fraud in a federal court in Maryland. HyperFund\u2019s co-founder, Australian citizen Sam Lee, was also charged. Another American promoter, Miami resident Rodney Burton, aka \u201cBitcoin Rodney,\u201d was arrested the same day and is being detained. Chunga faces up to five years in prison; Burton could serve 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe level of alleged fraud here is staggering,\u201d said US attorney Erek L.

The charges against Chunga and Lee by the SEC and the DoJ, as well as Burton\u2019s arrest, signal that the American crackdown on crypto isn\u2019t finished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, federal regulators took action against the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase, FTX, and Binance, or their founders. In perhaps the most high-profile case, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of stealing at least $10 billion from investors.\n\nOther schemes were also exposed. A YouTuber was charged for defrauding investors of about $1 billion and using it to buy himself shiny things like Rolex watches. Federal and state investigators probed the founder of cryptocurrency lender Celsius over fraud concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmaller-scale scams haven\u2019t been spared. Most recently (and surprisingly), a Colorado pastor of an online church was charged by the state\u2019s Division of Securities for crypto fraud, after milking about $3 million from investors."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs in 401(k)s a useful diversifier, proponents say - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The SEC\u2019s approval of spot-price bitcoin ETFs means that the digital asset finally has an entry point into 401(k) plans \u2013 but don\u2019t count on it appearing on investment menus anytime soon.\n\nInstead, retirement investors will most likely be able to access bitcoin ETFs through 401(k) plans\u2019 brokerage windows and, eventually, through asset allocation products like target-date funds. Given the extreme volatility of bitcoin and the range of opinions about its future, only a small proportion of a portfolio should be devoted to it, proponents say.\n\n\u201cBecause these are ordinary ETFs, they are immediately available in self-directed accounts,\u201d said Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines. For people who are active investors or traders in 401(k) plans, that access is meaningful \u2013 but those who are in default investment options or choose funds from the plan menu might not get bitcoin exposure for a while.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for that. Because the ETFs are new, they haven\u2019t been incorporated into any target-date products that would seek to add them. Additionally, 401(k) plan sponsors are widely risk-averse when it comes to making changes, including adding what is essentially a new asset class. Guidance in 2022 from the Department of Labor also tempered expectations, as the regulator urged fiduciaries to \u201cexercise extreme care\u201d when considering the addition of bitcoin to their plans.\n\nFurther, ETFs are few and far between in 401(k) plans, in part because record-keeping systems weren\u2019t designed around intraday trading.\n\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS\n\nAllocating 1 percent to 5 percent of assets to bitcoin can have advantages, as that range is small enough to protect investors from harm if the digital asset fails, but the potential for outsize price appreciation could have a materially positive effect on portfolios, said Edelman, who\u2019s co-founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cThis is the best of both worlds \u2013 it reduces risk in the portfolio but improves returns,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lack of correlation to stocks and bonds also makes bitcoin advantageous as a diversifier, said Mike Alfred, who runs hedge fund Alpine Fox, which focuses on bitcoin and bitcoin-related equities. Alfred also co-founded retirement plan ratings firm BrightScope, as well as fintech Digital Assets Data.\n\n\u201cFrom a mathematical standpoint, it\u2019s kind of foolish not to include it in 401(k) plans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another asset class. It\u2019s not different from emerging markets, gold, or other commodities. Once the gatekeepers understand the asset class, it invariably ends up in these plans.\u201d\n\nFamed Yale chief investment officer David Swensen, who died in 2021, began incorporating bitcoin into the university\u2019s endowment in 2018 through investments in venture funds. Swensen\u2019s \u201cYale model\u201d of investing, developed along with Dean Takahashi, for many years delivered strong returns by focusing on alternative asset classes rather than traditional stocks and bonds, Alfred noted.\n\nThe best manifestation within 401(k)s, at least in the near future, would be inclusion of bitcoin ETFs within asset allocation funds that are used as the defaults, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand that this is coming,\u201d Alfred said.\n\nIt\u2019s also evident that people want bitcoin, said Edelman, who projects that $150 billion will flow into bitcoin ETFs within three years, with the price of bitcoin reaching $150,000.\n\n\u201cEmployers who respond to those workers\u2019 demands will improve employee morale by demonstrating their responsiveness to this new opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an opportunity for forward-thinking advisors and employers.\u201d\n\nOf course, changes in the 401(k) world are slow to happen, and the consultants who help shape investment menus may not see incentives to add bitcoin soon, Edelman noted.\n\nThe fact that the digital asset is available in an ETF format helps address the concerns the DOL has cited with bitcoin, but the regulator\u2019s stance will nonetheless be slow to soften, he said.\n\nCurrently, there are means of accessing bitcoin through 401(k)s, including through Fidelity\u2019s Digital Assets Account, which has not caught on quickly, Edelman said. But the fact that Fidelity is among those with a spot bitcoin ETF is significant, given that it is one of the biggest retirement plan providers.\n\n\u201cThis will make it very easy for millions of 401(k) plans to make this ETF available,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nMeanwhile, the biggest 401(k) provider, Vanguard, has indicated that it is not planning to offer access to spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cVanguard is getting a lot of criticism \u2013 and deservedly so \u2013 for denying millions of investors from making their own investment choices,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nALL THE HYPE\n\nSince the SEC begrudgingly approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on January 10, nearly $2 billion flowed into the products in the first three days of trading, according to figures from Reuters.\n\nMike Harris, associate professor of retirement studies at the College for Financial Planning, said the excitement reminds him of the tech bubble or the housing market in 2007. In cases with such intense investor interest, there is a risk that valuations are already at a high point, he said.\n\n\u201cI would be astounded if a 401(k) investment committee would say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ll let people invest in the bitcoin ETF.\u2019 Their liability on that would be pretty huge,\u201d Harris said. That said, small holdings within an asset allocation product could be more reasonable, he said.\n\nIn individual retirement accounts, people should limit their bitcoin exposure, particularly if they are in or near retirement, he noted.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to keep in mind that if people see significant investment losses, the returns needed to make up for those in future years are higher, Harris said. \u201cThis is like dynamite \u2013 which is really helpful if you\u2019re digging a hole.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin zealots fighting on social media are about as rare as the torrent of Taylor Swift-Super Bowl stories we\u2019re fated to endure for the next 12 days, so I typically ignore them. But one long-running feud has caught my attention because tribes of Bitcoin warriors are not attacking other blockchains, which is their usual thing, but instead are going after each other. So I figured it was finally time to figure out what the fuss was about.\n\nThe beef in question is over a new thing called Ordinals, which arrived last year following an update to Bitcoin\u2019s core code. The invention is a clever one and involves ascribing a number to each satoshi (0.00000001 of a Bitcoin) that is minted on every new Bitcoin block, thereby creating a new type of record system on the world\u2019s preeminent blockchain.\n\nThis new numbering system also provided an opportunity to inscribe media on each Ordinal, meaning Bitcoin has a new use case in addition to its original one as a financial ledger. And so Bitcoin\u2019s version of the NFT was born. The Ordinal regime can be used to inscribe any piece of text or small image (here\u2019s an example), and so the most popular applications have become compilations of great artworks and passages from the Constitution to inspire others. Just kidding. This is crypto, so people are rushing to inscribe images of wizards and cats and god knows what else in hopes of flipping them for a profit.\n\nThe flood of Bitcoin NFTS\u2014there are already millions of them\u2014seems harmless but has infuriated segments of the Bitcoin old guard, who dislike the idea of using the blockchain for anything but financial transactions, and who are irked that a wave of digital crap has led to higher transaction fees. \u201cAnother civil war is brewing between a laser-eyes faction who thinks money is the only use case, and another faction that wants NFTs and to open up more uses cases,\u201d explains Hong Kim, a cofounder of the Bitcoin-focused firm Bitwise.\n\nI spoke to Kim to get an honest broker\u2019s take on what the Bitcoin feud is all about and who is likely to prevail. He says the laser-eyed purists have a point because Ordinals have caused Bitcoin transaction costs to spike at times. This has led to proposed countermeasures, including a Jack Dorsey-backed mining pool that warned it would refuse to process Bitcoin blocks containing Ordinals.\n\nKim added, though, that he and others might not be especially fond of \u201cpeople degen-ing with Ordinals,\u201d but that very few support the idea of censoring transactions based on their content. He also says that, like them or not, Ordinals are here to stay. A big reason for this is that, unlike the bitter block-size wars of 2015\u2014when Bitcoin was in a full-blown schism over whether to increase blocks by two or even eight times\u2014the blockchain\u2019s influential core developers are willing to put up with Ordinals. Some even like the idea of opening Bitcoin up to new use cases.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the current feud is over, especially as so many Bitcoiners can\u2019t seem to get through the day without beefing with someone on X. In the longer term, though, Ordinals will likely come to be seen as one of the most interesting things to happen to Bitcoin in years.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nFranklin Templeton removed \"Laser Eyes Ben Franklin\" as its social media avatar, saying the profile pic was always intended to be temporary for its Bitcoin ETF launch.

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving and Miner Economics \u2013 Coinbase Institutional Market Intelligence - Coinbase",
        "content": "The exponential growth of Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate to date underpins the strength and security of the underlying asset, making it relevant for bitcoin\u2019s economic fundamentals. An increase in the hash rate is an increase in the cost to fork or otherwise reorganize the network. In our view, however, hash rate growth is not limitless and may increasingly slow \u2013 or even shrink \u2013 following subsequent halving cycles. Mining machines have had smaller proportional efficiency gains relative to the growth of the network hash rate, and without significant bitcoin price appreciation, the revenue per unit of hash power could drop to all time lows following the halving in April 2024. Thinner margins could result in a larger proportion of forced selling by miners in order to meet fixed operational and financing costs, possibly making some miners unprofitable and increasing consolidation by well-capitalized entities who are able to acquire distressed assets at a discount. Although this is not an imminent threat to Bitcoin\u2019s sustainability, the drop in fixed block rewards does underscore the need for innovation that can drive miner revenue to support a strong network hash rate. In fact, recent surges in transaction fees have had an outsized impact on miner revenues compared to price movements. Absent any drastic price shocks, however, our overall view is that the network hash rate will likely continue to grow post-halving in the short-to-medium term, but may subsequently stall absent price appreciation or increased transaction fees. We think this could further push the Bitcoin community to explore solutions that sustainably drive miner revenue in the longer term due to renewed attention on Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate security.\n\nThe Decreasing Price Sensitivity of Miners The overall bitcoin mining market can be viewed as a globally distributed commodity manufacturing operation with costs consisting primarily of (1) upfront physical mining rig and infrastructure overhead and (2) ongoing costs centered on energy expenditure and operations. Normalizing miner revenues to daily USD earned per terahash per second (TH/s) of compute power reveals that miner unit revenues have not risen in line with bitcoin price appreciation in 2023 (see Chart 1). (Note: for succinctness, all subsequent measures of compute power are done on a per second basis.) In layman\u2019s terms, that means the increasing hash rate has likely absorbed most of the upside from higher bitcoin prices. Furthermore, it suggests that most increases in individual miner revenues have been driven primarily via the acquisition of more mining rigs. In fact, prior to 2022, short term price increases to bitcoin greatly outpaced the supply flexibility of the network hash rate, resulting in the revenue per TH closely tracking movements in price. Since early 2023, however, daily revenues per TH have remained comparatively range bound between $0.05 and $0.15. While revenues are still correlated with bitcoin price, the elasticity of miner revenue with respect to bitcoin price has dropped sharply (i.e. the magnitude of correlated movements has decreased). It is worth noting that the May and December 2023 miner revenue spikes above $0.10/TH/day were driven largely by a rise in transaction fees led by Ordinals usage, which saw transaction fees constitute more than 30% of total miner revenue at times (see Chart 2). In our view, the outsized impact of transaction fees on miner unit revenue is a result of the sporadic nature of this revenue stream, rendering established hedging strategies against the price volatility less applicable. This makes it difficult for miners to scale computing power based on predictable future transaction fees. For this reason, we think that the variability in transaction fees will continue to play an outsized role in miner revenue fluctuations, especially after the drop in fixed block rewards post-halving.\n\nMiner Positioning and Post-Halving Economics From a multi-year perspective, it is clear that the increasing saturation of the Bitcoin network hash rate is the primary driver of the decrease in revenue per TH (see Chart 3). Although the price of bitcoin far outpaced the more constrained growth of network hash rate throughout 2021 and 2022, the long term trend of hash rate has grown to meet bitcoin\u2019s USD price. It is also evident that improvements to custom bitcoin mining machines (application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs) has been a marginal contributor to increased hash rate \u2013 the 1200% growth in network hash rate and price over the last five years far outpaced the 170% improvement in ASIC efficiency gains during that time by seven-fold. Hash rate growth has been driven primarily by an increase in the total number of operating ASICs rather than optimizations in energy efficiency. The network hash rate currently has a growth rate of approximately 100% annually, roughly keeping pace with price appreciation since 2H22. Following the halving, however, we are on course to set a historical low of bitcoin-denominated revenue per TH (see Chart 4). In addition to fixed block rewards halving from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block, recent filings from public bitcoin mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms reveal plans to significantly increase their mining capacity in the short-to medium term by more than 30%. It is reasonable to think that other mining groups plan on doing the same (public miners constitute ~25% of global hash rate), which could further compound the downward pressure on revenues per TH. That said, we believe the hash rate still has some economically sustainable room to grow in the next few months prior to the halving as a result of increased transaction fees. Per our calculations, the realized network hash rate peaked at around 25% of the theoretical maximum sustainable hash rate through the 2020 halving, which we think still applies today (see Chart 5). Following the increase in transaction fees beginning in December 2023 the network is only operating at approximately 15% of the theoretical max. Echoing our earlier statement on the outsized impact of variable fee revenue, we have found that the maximum theoretical hash rate peaked on December 30 at the same time transaction fee revenue peaked, despite the price of bitcoin reaching a local top later on January 11, 2024. (Note: The theoretical maximum hash rate is computed by finding the maximum total hash rate that can be generated by 75% of state-of-the-art efficiency machines to have exact breakeven costs on energy at $0.02/kWh, all with zero profitability to cover any other operational costs or the initial financing of ASICs.) Assuming network metrics (bitcoin price, transaction fees, and hash rate) remain constant, the realized hash rate percentage would reach approximately 24% post-halving, in line with its historical \u201csoft-ceiling\u201d. However, miners would need to operate at a higher percentage of the maximum theoretical hash rate (approximately 32%) if transaction fees revert to pre-Ordinals levels \u2013 which may be unsustainable over the long-term for a subset of miners. Again, this discounts any variations to hash rate, which would likely skew these percentages higher as hash rate grows. The aforementioned ongoing investments into scaling would likely sustain the hash rate growth for several months after the halving in order to cover financing costs of new equipment and other operational costs. Beyond that, the path to profitable hash rate growth after that is less certain. It would require one or more of (1) bitcoin price appreciation, (2) reliable increases in transaction fees, or (3) unprecedented breakthroughs in ASIC efficiency. In our view, the post-halving miner economics could increase selling pressure on miners as margins narrow and less excess profit can be retained in bitcoin. This may not be immediately impactful to markets, however. As the rate of bitcoin issuance drops, the absolute number of bitcoin that miners can sell also drops \u2013 even if they are selling a proportionally higher amount of mining rewards. What may be more concerning is a scenario where miners need to sell portions of their unrestricted bitcoin holdings to finance future operations, though we don\u2019t think that would be likely in the near term. In the long run, however, decreased mining revenue margins is a potential threat to decentralization in bitcoin mining operations. We think the next halving will weaken the viability of independent, non-institutional miners from retaining profitability, which could further contribute to consolidation both at the miner and the mining pool levels. Institutional miners likely are better positioned to acquire distressed mining assets at a discount, have improved operational efficiency due to economies of scale, and have access to cheaper energy sources. Although concentration risks for private miners is unknown, the Bitcoin hash rate currently appears to be well distributed among miners, with the largest publicly traded bitcoin mining companies all below 5% of global hash rate. However, there is concern over the growing centralization of mining pools with two pools controlling more than half of the hash rate. If well-capitalized mining entities absorb smaller competitors, this centralization is likely to continue increasing.\n\nVariable Sources of Miner Revenue As fixed rewards drop post-halving, we think the future profitability of miners will increasingly rely on transaction fee driven revenue. That said, the path to achieving this is not straightforward. Fees also constituted a high proportion of block rewards through the 2017/18 and 2021/22 cycles where transaction fees similarly contributed 20%+ of transaction fees at various points. In our view, this is largely because periods of significant appreciation in bitcoin price draws increased network usage, which in turn drives up transaction fees. However, none of the increases to date have been sustainable (in contrast with Ethereum\u2019s consistent daily gas used ). Ordinals have been touted as one solution, though the volatility in Bitcoin Ordinals transactions suggests that such activity may be transient or cyclical in nature (similar to NFTs on Ethereum). Ongoing work in Bitcoin layer-2s (L2s) seem promising, though none have yet gained sufficient traction in constituting meaningful portions of transaction fees. Separate from mining bitcoin, some institutional miners can additionally profit from energy agreements with local governments where they are able to turn off mining operations and curb energy expenditures in return for energy credits. This, however, does not contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s economic security via active hash power, and also further advantages well-capitalized mining entities that can draw on reserves to weather variations in bitcoin price or periods of reduced mining activity. Thus, the creation of sustainable bitcoin network fees to miners beyond block rewards is imperative."

Though not as large of an asset manager, Fidelity had $11.5 trillion assets under administration, as of Sept. 30.\n\nSumit Roy, a senior analyst at ETF.com, said while he expects both firms\u2019 funds to grow substantially over time, it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d to predict which will be larger.\n\n\u201cFidelity\u2019s advantage is that it has a massive base of retail and adviser clients using its brokerage services, so it can easily push the ETF to them,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cOn the other hand, BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with plenty of marketing and distribution muscle of its own.\u201d\n\nRoy added: \u201cIt really is a heavyweight fight that can go either way.\u201d\n\nA Fidelity spokesperson declined to comment on how it could seek to boost assets in FBTC. A BlackRock representative did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nCoinShares product head Townsend Lansing noted that exchange-traded products are access tools for traditional investors, many of whom place a lot of value in brand names.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that more crypto native [firms] won\u2019t have opportunities to show value or earn flows as investors demand and reward more bespoke and informed insight into digital assets,\u201d Lansing added.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nA fund by Ark Invest and 21Shares, as well as one by crypto-focused firm Bitwise, sit in third and fourth place with about $600 million of net inflows each.\n\nWhile Grayscale Investments\u2019 Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) started with a big asset lead of roughly $28 billion, its net outflows have totaled more than $5 billion in its first few weeks trading as an ETF.\n\nRead more: As GBTC outflows continue, will the largest bitcoin ETF be dethroned?\n\nSome have compared spot bitcoin ETFs to the launch of physically-backed gold ETFs.\n\nBut David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime brokerage FalconX, noted the more competitive landscape this time around, with 10 spot bitcoin ETFs launching on the same day.\n\nContrarily, while State Street Global Advisors\u2019 SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) came to market in November 2004, BlackRock\u2019s Gold Trust (IAU) didn\u2019t launch until January 2005. GLD has roughly $55.5 billion in assets, while IAU manages about $25.7 billion.\n\n\u201cGiven the differences in the competitive dynamics on the spot [bitcoin] ETF launch versus the gold ETFs launched almost two decades ago, I\u2019d not be surprised to see a group of three to five funds gathering the lion\u2019s share of assets, perhaps with the top three more distant from the rest of the group,\u201d Lawant said.\n\nThe FalconX research executive said predicting the ultimate spot bitcoin ETF asset leader is tough at this stage.\n\n\u201cThe primary winner in this race is the consumer, who ultimately gets products that offer access to crypto at a highly competitive cost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe speed at which the fees got to where they are now suggests that both firms are dead serious about establishing their presence in crypto.\u201d\n\nExcluding GBTC, which sports a fee of 1.5%, the nine other US spot bitcoin ETFs have expense ratios ranging between 0.19% and 0.30%.\n\nA product by Invesco and Galaxy was the latest to adjust its fee, reducing its price Monday from 0.39% to 0.25% \u2014 matching BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Portal, a startup building a Bitcoin BTC -7.25% -based cross-chain decentralized exchange and wallet, has raised $34 million in a seed funding round. Investors in the round included Coinbase Ventures, Arrington Capital, OKX Ventures, and Gate.io, Portal said Tuesday.\n\nThe seed round was structured as a combination of a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) and convertible notes, all of which have been fully converted into equity, Portal co-founder and CEO Chandra Duggirala told The Block in an interview. There is no debt component in the round, Duggirala noted, declining to comment on valuation. He also declined to comment on the specific timeline for when the funding round started and ended but said it \"closed recently.\"\n\nAt $34 million, Portal's seed round surpasses the typical size for a seed round. Duggirala said it was oversubscribed by more than two times due to increased interest in the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe seed round brings Portal's total funding to $42.5 million, adding to the $8.5 million raised in pre-seed funding in 2021.\n\nWhat is Portal?\n\nPortal is a Bitcoin-based cross-chain atomic swaps protocol. Its two main products are a decentralized exchange and a wallet.\n\nPortal DEX enables Layer 2 atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies across blockchains. Portal wallet, a \"fully non-custodial\" tool, integrates the DEX and allows users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies across blockchains.\n\n\"You can think of Portal as a cross-chain Lightning Network,\" Duggirala said. \"It's fast, inexpensive, easy, and there is no custodial risk.\"\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe current cross-chain swap tools, such as wrapped tokens and bridges, are risky as they have lost billions of dollars in hacks and involve some type of custody risk, Duggirala said, adding that Portal doesn't custody user funds at all, either through one signature or multiple signatures.\n\nPortal products are currently in the testnet form, and \"mainnet readiness is quite feasible by March,\" Duggirala said.\n\nPortal plans and token\n\nWith fresh funding in place, Portal plans to launch its products on the mainnet and grow its ecosystem. \"We want to support and integrate with as many wallets and single-chain decentralized exchanges that use bridges,\" Duggirala said. \"Our goal is to replace completely the custodial risk in this space.\"\n\nAsked if Portal plans to launch its own native token, Duggirala said that decision would depend on the validators of the Portal network. The network runs on the xport (proposed ticker) token, an ERC-20 token, Duggirala said, adding that it is used to secure the network and reward validators for enabling the swaps.\n\nFounded in 2019, Portal is based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Duggirala declined to comment on the current headcount of the firm but said the team has doubled in the last year, and Portal is continuing to hire.\n\nIn the coming months, Portal also plans to launch an AI-powered investment application that will help users leverage the AI technology to make \"intelligent\" investing decisions, Duggirala said."

Wen has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn 2018 the UK police seized four separate devices containing more than 61,000 bitcoin from a safety deposit box and a property where Wen and her then-employer, Yadi Zhang, lived at the time, Southwark Crown Court heard.\n\nThe value of the bitcoin by the time all of the cryptocurrency had been recovered by the police, in July 2021, added up to about \u00a31.4bn.\n\nThe prosecution told the jury at the start of the trial on Monday that the bitcoin derived from an investment fraud Zhang had committed in China between 2014 and 2017.\n\nZhang, whose real name is Zhimin Qian, stole roughly \u00a35bn from more than 128,000 investors. She then converted the money into bitcoin and arrived, under a false identity, in London in 2017, the court heard.\n\nShe has since fled the UK and remains at large, according to prosecutors.\n\nWen is not accused of any involvement in that fraud. However, she has been accused of helping to convert some of Zhang\u2019s bitcoin into cash, jewellery and other luxury items, as well as property, while allegedly knowing it was the proceeds of crime.\n\nGillian Jones KC, counsel for the Crown Prosecution Service, told the jury on Tuesday that Wen had tried to purchase a \u00a312.5mn London property on behalf of Zhang in 2018 using the law firm Mishcon de Reya. The purchase had failed because the law firm could not verify the source of the bitcoin, the jury heard. In October that year, the Met froze money held by Mishcon in its client account.\n\nWen had moved to the UK in 2007 from China and became a British citizen in 2018. She has described herself as Zhang\u2019s \u201ccarer\u201d and said she believed all of Zhang\u2019s bitcoin had derived from legitimate business activities, Jones told the jury.\n\nBut Jones said on Monday that Wen was a \u201cfront person\u201d who was paid to \u201ckeep Ms Zhang in the background\u201d.\n\n\u201cMs Wen had been trusted not only with copies of the passwords and passphrases to access the laptops [containing the bitcoin] but with access to where the laptops were being stored,\u201d Jones said.\n\nBefore meeting Zhang in 2017, Wen had worked in Chinese takeaway restaurants, the court heard.\n\nThe trial continues."

The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., though, gives it an edge ahead of at least Asia and Africa (the European Union and other nations already have bitcoin ETF products ).\n\nGiven jurisdictions in and around Asia have particularly been vying to become crypto hubs, expectations for a bitcoin ETF are higher there than in Africa. The UAE, Singapore and Hong Kong have, to different degrees, framed policies that attract retailers and financial institutions interested in the crypto space. But none have so far given regulatory approval to a bitcoin ETF-like product.\n\nCoinDesk spoke to more than a dozen analysts and industry participants, a majority of whom said that Australia would likely be the next country to approve spot bitcoin ETF products. Hong Kong has voiced the most interest in achieving the reality of a bitcoin ETF approval and that the U.S. approval could move things along faster for almost all the jurisdictions in the area.\n\nFor full coverage of bitcoin ETFs, click here.\n\nNow that the U.S. has allowed nearly a dozen products to launch, other countries like the U.K., Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan could introduce policies \u201cto prevent large and medium-sized financial institutions from transferring their funds out\u201d of their regions, said Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research.\n\nAustralia is in the lead\n\nAustralia is expected to be among the first with approval with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) imminent in the \u201cfirst or second quarter of 2024,\u201d said Liam Hennessy, a Brisbane-based lawyer at Clyde & Co.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAustralia is definitely leading over Hong Kong and Singapore at this stage,\u201d said Hennessy in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cIn Australia, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF is number one since it applied in July 2023.\u201d\n\nTechnically, Australia already has two exchange-traded products providing exposure to spot crypto assets on Cboe Australia. However, Australian industry experts said there\u2019s more excitement over the potential for a similar product to begin trading on Cboe Australia's larger rival, ASX, where the anticipation lies due to the larger volumes available there.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) is the market regulator which had effectively \u201callowed\u201d such products in 2022.\n\nMonochrome Asset Management is \u201canticipating that the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF becomes quoted in the second quarter of this year,\u201d said Derek Vladimir Henningsen, general counsel and head of Legal and Compliance, the digital asset manager, in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\n\"It makes sense that the ASX is a fast follower, so the U.S. approval may give the ASX some assurance,\" Henningsen said.\n\nWhile both Hennessy and Henningsen said the number of applicants for a spot-bitcoin ETF-like product in Australia isn\u2019t \u201cpublic knowledge,\u201d the Australian Financial Review reported that Bitcoin ETFs are lining up for approvals.\n\n\u201cThe Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is set to approve an exchange-traded fund linked to the price of bitcoin in the first half of this year,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) and ASX, which falls under ASIC, are responsible for a license and an approval respectively. Monochrome has already got a license from ASIC through a separate entity, Vasco Trustees Limited.\n\nAn ASIC spokesperson said it is ultimately for the market operators that quote ETFs (currently ASX and CBOE) to be comfortable that a product meets their operating rules and procedures.\n\nAn ASX spokesperson said it had amended the rules in August 2022 to allow crypto ETFs and that it continues to engage with a number of issuers interested in admission while saying it does not comment on investment product applications.\n\n\u201cOthers may have filed an application, but they certainly aren\u2019t talking about it publicly,\u201d Hennessy said. \u201cBut there are a number of other people who have filed closed ended funds or private ETFs, which are a fund to invest in digital assets not traded on an exchange.\u201d\n\nHong Kong, Singapore and UAE\n\nHong Kong, Singapore and the UAE have projected an interest to be seen as crypto hubs of the world, but have not seen bitcoin ETFs in their regions.\n\nHong Kong lawmaker Johnny Ng, one of the city's loudest advocates for crypto , took to X hours after the U.S. approvals to say \u201cHong Kong must dare to be a 'leader' in the field of virtual assets\u201d and \u201cpromote the implementation of spot ETFs as soon as possible.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s attempts to reclaim its title as a crypto hub has seen it roll out a new licensing regime that gives crypto exchanges a pathway to operate in a regulated manner. It's also said it's ready to consider applications for spot crypto ETFs .\n\n\u201cHong Kong looks likely to be the next to approve spot crypto ETFs,\u201d said H.B. Lim, managing director of APAC for BitGo, which is also the bitcoin custodian for Hashdex , one of the applicants for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nPreviously, Lim spent 13 years as a regulator across Singapore\u2019s central bank and Abu Dhabi Global Market\u2019s regulatory authority. He said that U.S. approvals may prompt Family Offices and High Net Worth Individuals to avoid generational questions of why none of the Family Office portfolio was allocated to crypto back in the day.\n\n\u201cIn addition, HK's reputation as a strong financial center with some of the deepest capital markets and the largest stock market when compared to Singapore or those in the Middle East, strategic position within the Greater Bay Area, coupled with the HK government\u2019s public support for web3, are factors that will draw spot crypto ETF issuers to HK,\u201d Lim said.\n\nSingapore\u2019s attempts to strike a balance between favorable and protective regulations while continuing to promote technology without speculation have reflected a hot and cold approach to crypto. But analysts believe the approvals in the U.S. might be just what the city-state needed to allow products like bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cSingapore wanted to see flows come in from a bigger market like the U.S.,\u201d said the Singapore based Danny Lim , contributor at MarginX , a decentralized exchange infrastructure that facilitates the trading of derivatives. \u201cThey will tag along now with the liquidity from the U.S.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said spot Bitcoin ETFs are not approved for offer to retail investors and reiterated that people who choose to \u201ctrade in Bitcoin ETFs in overseas markets must exercise extreme caution.\u201d\n\nAngela Ang, a senior policy adviser for blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs pointed to Singapore\u2019s strong and longstanding concerns around speculative retail trading.\n\n\u201cOne piece of the puzzle could be whether would-be issuers in Singapore can satisfactorily address MAS' concerns around retail participation,\u201d Ang said.\n\nPerhaps the region least likely to immediately promote bitcoin ETF-type products is the UAE, according to a former regulator from a UAE financial free zone authority who sought anonymity because the person wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the media in their current role.\n\n\u201cThe conditions are not quite right in the UAE/MENA in general to launch a spot bitcoin ETF,\u201d the person said. \u201cTo do so, there needs to be sufficient market liquidity from traditional finance players, who may not already have connectivity to UAE markets.\u201d\n\nThe person explained that if you\u2019re going to tap TradFi, you need to go where there is TradFi liquidity and the issue in the UAE is connectivity. If the UAE authorities list a spot-bitcoin ETF, interested investors in other parts of the world \u2013 for example India or the United Kingdom \u2013 need to have a relationship with a member of a stock exchange market in the region like the Dubai Financial Market.\n\n\u201cThe rules in the UAE to establish such links make it expensive,\u201d said the person. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule out the UAE finding a way past this but at the moment, it\u2019s unlikely to be worth it to just trade one product; there needs to be a compelling suite on offer to attract TradFi players who can provide retail and institutional investors with the necessary market access.\u201d\n\nRead More: Spot Ether ETF Applications Decisions Delayed by SEC"

However, JPMorgan analysts said that the group saw roughly $15 million of net sales on Friday.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve been seeing transaction volumes slowing this past week, we think we are perhaps seeing indication of the hype around these ETFs abating and entering a perhaps more normalized flow environment,\u201d analyst Kenneth Worthington wrote in a Monday note.\n\nVanEck\u2019s crypto research head Matthew Sigel told Blockworks last week that the flows remained in line with the projections from his firm.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "For more than a decade, the pioneers of the cryptocurrency industry envisioned digital coins as an alternate branch of finance, a renegade sector that would operate outside the reach of big banks and government regulators.\n\nBut as digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether became more mainstream, the crypto industry collided with a 1946 Supreme Court decision that created what is known as the Howey Test, a legal analysis that determines when a financial product becomes subject to the same strict rules as stocks and bonds.\n\nIn recent years, regulators have seized on that legal precedent to argue that cryptocurrencies are just another security, like shares of Apple or General Motors. The crypto industry has fought back, leaving it in a legal gray zone with an uncertain future in the United States.\n\nNow the long-running dispute is edging closer to a resolution, as federal judges begin weighing in on a series of lawsuits by the nation\u2019s top securities regulator against some of the largest crypto firms. This month, judges held hearings in two of the most consequential cases, which could dictate whether the multitrillion-dollar crypto industry can continue growing in the United States."

        "content": "Fintech provider Portal today announced it\u2019s received $34 million in seed funding to further development of a decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem that will enable peer-to-peer, cross-chain swaps of digital assets.\n\n\u201cPortal intends to solve the problem of custodial risk once and for all,\u201d cofounder and CEO Chandra Duggirala said in a statement.\n\nInvestors include Coinbase Ventures, Arrington Capital, OKX Ventures, and Gate.io, and the seed funding builds on Portal\u2019s angel round of $8.5 million, which closed in 2021.\n\n\u201cPortal is rapidly pushing ahead the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling fast and low-cost economic activity without being beholden to third parties,\u201d Michael Arrington, founder and partner of Arrington Capital, said in a statement.\n\nFounded in San Francisco in 2019, Portal enables customers to make safe cross-chain transactions without relying on third parties such as exchanges, bridges, or wrappers, which pose additional risks.\n\n\u201cFrom the very early days of Mt. Gox to FTX, centralized exchanges have been a persistent source of risk to user funds,\u201d said Duggirala. \u201cNow, the risk remains, but it has taken a new form in bridges and other custodial cross-chain solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cCustodial bridges have been the single-biggest problem in crypto, and it becomes particularly important when it comes to cross-chain operations because different blockchains are completely disparate things,\u201d Duggirala told Fortune. Bridges are touch points that allow transfers of tokens between blockchains, but they can be extremely vulnerable to hackers\u2014a single cross-chain exploit in 2022 drained some $625 million.\n\nWrapping is another solution users have opted for to make cross-chain transactions, whereby tokens are backed by a coin or asset, native to a different blockchain, to make them usable on a different network. But wrapped tokens rely on custodians to hold the original assets, which raises questions about centralization and counterparty risk.\n\n\u201cSo, how do you bind two completely independent systems together, the only reliable way?\u201d Duggirala asked. He says it can be done using transparent layer-2 atomic-swap technology. Layer-2 refers to protocols that operate atop a layer-1 blockchain\u2014like Bitcoin or Ethereum\u2014to improve scalability. Atomic swaps are exchange contracts that allow cryptocurrencies to be traded peer-to-peer without requiring a trusted third party.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been done before; as far as we know, this is the first of its kind,\u201d Duggirala said.\n\nPortal plans to use the funds to invest in engineering and building the ecosystem of two of its flagship products: Portal DEX and Portal Wallet. The former is the first Bitcoin-based exchange that allows swaps of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, and the latter is the non-custodial, user-facing tool that integrates Portal DEX.\n\n\u201cThe portable mobile wallet serves as basically like a standard for the user experience,\u201d Duggirala said, \u201cbut we want as many third-party wallets to integrate the swap as quickly as possible.\u201d"

        "content": "Vanguard Group\u2019s decision not to offer customer access to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds is a good sign for the fund giant and its clients, despite drawing sharp criticism from investors, according to Morningstar\u2019s vice president, research, John Rekenthaler.\n\n\u201cNot only has the company forsworn creating a bitcoin ETF, but it refuses to carry anybody else\u2019s bitcoin funds on its brokerage platform. Those wishing to purchase cryptocurrencies must go elsewhere,\u201d he said in a column posted Monday, adding that the decision \u201cdelighted\u201d him even as it angered crypto enthusiasts.\n\nVanguard historically often avoided offering in-demand funds that \u201ccrashed and burned\u201d for many peers, Rekenthaler noted.\n\n\u201cDoing so benefited its business far more than collecting a few billion dollars of incremental assets. Investors realized which fund companies had burned them \u2014 and which hadn\u2019t. Over time, they might have forgotten the details. But they remembered how they had been treated,\u201d Rekenthaler wrote.\n\nCritics might argue that bitcoin is different from earlier products that Vanguard avoided, as the proponents consider the cryptocurrency as \u201cdigital gold\u201d and a store of value, he noted.\n\n\u201cIf so, Vanguard could conceivably be called hypocritical,\u201d as it offers many single-commodity funds on its brokerage platform, including ETFs investing in gold bullion or oil barrels, Rekenthaler said.\n\n\u201cFine by me. First, simply calling bitcoin \u2018digital gold\u2019 does not make it so. Physical gold broke even during 2022\u2032s financials-market meltdown, while bitcoin\u2019s price collapsed,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cSecond \u2026 in Vanguard\u2019s judgment, cryptocurrency is currently unsuitable for its clients. In the future, that may change. But its ruling is for the here and now,\u201d the research said.\n\nVanguard\u2019s move is line with its late founder\u2019s philosophy, Rekenthaler wrote, noting that John Bogle (who died in early 2019) recommended investors \u201cavoid bitcoin like the plague.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF vs Buying BTC Directly: What\u2019s Better? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "A spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been one of the hottest topics over the past few years. Many investment companies, both traditional and crypto-oriented, have been filing multiple applications with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission over and over again.\n\nOn January 10th, 2024, the SEC finally gave the go-ahead and greenlighted a total of 11 Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nIt\u2019s been a hard-fought battle spanning many years, and if you want to check out the full timeline of the events, take a look at our detailed article on the matter:\n\nTimeline of Events Leading to Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval in the United States\n\nWith the approval already a fact, it\u2019s now critical to explore a very important subject \u2013 the difference between buying a spot Bitcoin ETF and buying Bitcoin directly and what might be better for you.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick table of comparison between both, while the following article provides a more in-depth look.\n\nWhat is a Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nExchange-traded funds have been a cornerstone in the world of traditional finance for many years.\n\nIn essence, an ETF represents a basket (or individual) of assets, and it trades on an exchange just like a regular stock does. It can track the price of various types of assets, including but not limited to securities, commodities, or other assets. It can track multiple assets or just one (as is the case with the spot Bitcoin ETF).\n\nIn the case of the Bitcoin ETFs, they provide a traditional and well-regarded investment vehicle to gain exposure to the price of BTC.\n\nThere is, however, a technical difference between the ETF itself and the asset that it tracks. Since the ETF itself is a standalone product \u2013 it has a market of its own and trades independently of the asset that underpins it. This is why there might be a difference between the ETF price and the net asset value (NAV) of the underpinning product.\n\nThere are other important takeaways that characterize the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, so let\u2019s have a look at a comprehensive summary.\n\nTrades on traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange\n\nBecause the ETF is a traditional investment product, it trades on regulated exchanges on Wall Street, such as the New York Stock Exchange. ETFs don\u2019t trade on cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance.\n\nInvestors don\u2019t own the underlying BTC\n\nOwning an ETF doesn\u2019t grant ownership to the underlying product. Think of it as a synthetic asset that\u2019s built on top of BTC, and it tracks its price. Investors who buy the ETF don\u2019t have to worry about storing and safekeeping BTC.\n\nThe shares in the ETF are backed by BTC, which is owned and stored by the ETF provider.\n\nThere are acquisition fees depending on the ETF provider\n\nThere are multiple Bitcoin ETFs, and each of them comes with different fees stipulated by the provider. In the case of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), there\u2019s a sponsor fee of 0.25% (T&C apply).\n\nManaged by the ETF provider\n\nETFs are managed by the companies that launch them. They can pull support if they don\u2019t meet certain criteria and can also change the fees at their own volition.\n\nTrades within traditional US trading hours\n\nBecause ETFs trade on traditional and regulated US exchanges like NYSE, they can only be accessed during regular US trading hours.\n\nThere might be an ETF/NAV price difference\n\nThere might be a price difference between the Bitcoin ETF and the price of Bitcoin on the same day. This is because ETFs trade on their separate markets, which dictate their current price.\n\nPros and Cons of a Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe above characteristics are specific to Bitcoin ETFs, and they bring certain advantages and disadvantages.\n\nPros:\n\nRegulated financial product\n\nIt can be included in specialized portfolios like retirement or 401(k)\n\nBacked by regulated and reputable providers like BlackRock\n\nCons:\n\nInvestors do not own the underlying BTC\n\nThere might be a premium on the ETF compared to the BTC NAV\n\nLimited trading hours and higher fees\n\nBuying BTC Directly\n\nAs opposed to ETFs, buying Bitcoin directly provides you with ownership over the BTC, regardless of whether you buy it from an exchange or P2P.\n\nOf course, if you do buy it through an exchange such as Binance, you should consider self-custody. This means that you should take your BTC off the exchange and transfer it into a cold wallet such as Trezor or Ledger, where you control the private keys.\n\nIn crypto, there\u2019s a popular saying that goes like this:\n\n\u201cNot your keys, not your Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThis also comes with certain responsibilities. Keeping your crypto safe can be a challenging task, especially if you have no prior experience. Worry not, however, as we\u2019ve prepared a detailed guide on what you can do to make sure your BTC is safe.\n\n9 Tips for Securing Your Bitcoin and Crypto Wallets You Must Follow\n\nJust as it is with ETFs, buying Bitcoin directly has its specifics. Here\u2019s a quick summary.\n\nTrades on cryptocurrency exchanges\n\nYou can\u2019t buy Bitcoin on the New York Stock Exchange. You have to use a cryptocurrency exchange. The most popular ones are Binance (outside of the US) and Coinbase (US).\n\nInvestors get direct ownership of BTC\n\nOnce you buy spot BTC on a cryptocurrency exchange \u2013 you own it. You can transfer it out of the exchange to a cold storage, or you can use it to trade against other altcoins such as Ethereum.\n\nAcquisition fees vary between crypto exchanges\n\nUnlike ETFs, there\u2019s no Sponsor fee. There are, however, trading fees associated with buying and selling BTC, and they vary based on the cryptocurrency exchange of choice.\n\nManaged by you\n\nSince you have complete ownership over the BTC you bought, you are also responsible for its safety. Self-custody comes with certain challenges, and it\u2019s imperative that you learn about cold storage and how to keep your crypto safe.\n\nTrades 24/7, irrespective of traditional working hours\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges work around the clock, so there are no limitations in terms of trading hours or weekends.\n\nDirect exposure to the BTC price\n\nYou don\u2019t have to worry about differences in the price of the ETF and the net asset\u2019s value. You\u2019re as exposed to the BTC price as it\u2019s physically possible.\n\nPros and Cons of Buying BTC Directly\n\nHere are the advantages and disadvantages:\n\nPros:\n\nYou get direct ownership of the BTC you buy\n\nYou can get full control through self-custody\n\nUnlimited trading hours and lower fees\n\nCons:\n\nStoring your BTC can be challenging and requires higher technical expertise\n\nCan\u2019t include it in traditional retirement plans and 401(k)\n\nNot recognized as a financial instrument\n\nBitcoin ETF vs. Buying BTC Directly: What\u2019s Better?\n\nThe above comprises the most essential differences between a spot Bitcoin ETF and buying BTC directly.\n\nThere\u2019s no one answer as to which is better, and it strongly depends on the individual preferences and needs of the investor.\n\nFor instance, if you\u2019re not tech-savvy, not interested in trading BTC against other altcoins, want long-term exposure without having to worry about safekeeping your crypto, and don\u2019t mind the higher fees, an ETF might be the better option.\n\nHowever, if you are well-versed in the crypto field and prefer direct ownership of BTC because you want to either safely store it on your cold wallet or you want to trade it actively against other altcoins, then perhaps buying BTC directly is the way to go."

        "title": "History Says This Cryptocurrency Could Soar More Than 120% in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It looks like Bitcoin (BTC -4.59%), after rising more than 150% in 2023, has shaken off the frost from the longest crypto winter on record. Yet as great as last year was for the world's original cryptocurrency, 2024 is shaping up to be equally impressive.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this, but the most evident and potent is related to evolving supply and demand dynamics and historical patterns. History doesn't always repeat itself, but it often rhymes. And if something similar to years past unfolds in 2024, Bitcoin might have what it takes to hit the coveted $100,000 mark, a gain of more than 120%.\n\nHere's why a six-figure Bitcoin this year shouldn't be ruled out.\n\nA half of a half of half\n\nOne of Bitcoin's more well-known qualities is its finite supply. With a maximum supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin derives much of its value from the notion that it will become scarcer with time.\n\nBut how does Bitcoin preserve this scarcity? The answer is relatively straightforward: It all comes down to a mechanism hardwired into its code known as halving.\n\nAfter every 210,000 blocks are added to its blockchain, or roughly four years, Bitcoin's supply growth rate is cut in half. Today, the annual growth rate hovers around 1.75%, but will fall to a measly 0.875% in April 2024 at the time of the next halving.\n\nWith 19.6 million coins currently in circulation, the halvings ensure that the remaining 1.4 million will gradually enter the market at a decreasing rate until sometime in 2040, the projected year when the last Bitcoin will have been mined.\n\nHalvings form the foundation of Bitcoin's robust monetary policy and long-term value proposition. But they also have an impact on more immediate short-term price dynamics.\n\nWhile there are other factors that affect Bitcoin's price, elementary laws of supply and demand play a major role. In the years that halvings take place, prices typically increase as demand is forced to compete for a more constrained supply. Most importantly, though, demand doesn't have to increase for prices to rise. Should demand not change and at a minimum remain constant, the reduced growth rate puts pressure on Bitcoin's price.\n\nWe can see evidence of this when tracking Bitcoin in years past. During the year in which a halving occurs, Bitcoin rises on average by 128%. While past performance isn't indicative of future results, if a similar situation were to occur in 2024, Bitcoin could reach a price of around $96,000. That's close to the six-figure mark, but not quite there.\n\nBitcoin enters unprecedented territory\n\nOn their own, halvings are significant events that alter Bitcoin's trajectory. But the halving slated for April 2024 will be unlike any other.\n\nFor the first time in history, there will be fewer Bitcoins available on the market than at the previous halving. In the past, Bitcoin's available supply increased significantly. However, a threshold was crossed with the passing of the most recent halving in May 2020.\n\nData extrapolated from the available supply on exchanges suggests that at the time of the May 2020 halving, which dropped the block reward to its current level of 6.25 Bitcoins, demand finally outstripped supply. Since peaking at 3.2 million Bitcoins in March 2020, the number of available Bitcoins has decreased by nearly 30% to just 2.3 million. It's the lowest level since March 2018.\n\nThere are likely a few factors explaining this phenomenon, but the most likely culprit are the notoriously stubborn Bitcoin holders who never sell. During the crypto winter, long-term holders underwent a phase of historic accumulation. Even as prices plummeted, die-hard Bitcoin investors continued to scoop up coins at what they believed was a discount. Today, the total number of coins held by long-term investors sits at 14.78 million coins, or roughly 75% of Bitcoin's total circulating supply.\n\nTo the delight of these long-term holders, they are the reason Bitcoin will find itself in unprecedented territory at the time of the April halving. With a lack of available coins on the market and reduction to its supply growth, Bitcoin's price could soar, to which degree remains to be seen. But given the magnitude of the supply crunch and the combined impact of the halving, a compounding effect will be introduced that should prove more than capable of pushing Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark."

        "content": "Bitcoin futures trading has soared after the launch of spot ETFs in the US this month, the FT reported.\n\nThe CME Group has seen trading of bitcoin futures contracts reach a new high.\n\nFutures traders are pursuing a \"cash and carry\" arbitrage trade on bitcoin, per the FT.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFutures traders are piling into bitcoin contracts.\n\nAn average 66,000 futures contracts have been exchanged daily this month at the CME Group, marking a new high and an almost 50% rise month-to-month, according to The Financial Times.\n\nJanuary's open interest is already equal to about $4.6 billion, and rose to around $6 billion on the day the ETFs were given the green light by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWhile the high trading volumes show that the ETFs may have sparked interest in crypto among more mainstream investors, the heavy futures trading is more about arbitrage opportunities in bitcoin's volatile price swings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer, the FT, using the \"cash and carry\" strategy, traders sell a bitcoin futures contract at a premium, while also holding the underlying crypto. As the contract's expiration date nears, these prices move closer together, and the trade can generate significant returns with low risk. Since the approval of the ETFs, the trade has garnered more attention as holding shares of the fund can be a cheaper way to hang onto exposure to the token.\n\nThe swell of activity has allowed CME to eclipse Binance as the largest bitcoin derivatives trading exchange in the world. The company tends to work alongside asset management firms and hedge funds.\n\nAs for other corners of Wall Street, the ETFs' launch has yet to trigger overwhelming bullishness as had been projected by some crypto enthusiasts.\n\nInstead, in the over two weeks of trading, crypto asset manager Grayscale has seen large outflows from its ETF, while bitcoin itself has flailed. The token whipsawed in the weeks since the SEC's approval, falling below the key $40,000 threshold last week, and is trading basically where at the beginning of this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a Thursday note, JPMorgan's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, highlighted that the spot ETFs will likely help deepen the crypto market and further developments could boost derivatives trading.\n\n\"The emergence of spot ETFs is introducing another dimension in the bitcoin price discovery process along with onshore spot exchanges and onshore futures that echoes the price discovery that is taking place in the traditional financial system, in particular in equities where ETFs are more prevalent,\" he wrote."

        "title": "Bitcoin: Here's When BTC Will Hit $10 Million - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Bitcoin demonstrated resilience by maintaining a price above $42,000, rebounding from a dip over the weekend. With the crypto community closely monitoring Bitcoin\u2019s movements, the digital currency encounters resistance at key levels, particularly at $43,600 and $45,589.\n\n\n\nThe recent launch of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States has generated a mix of excitement and skepticism. Economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff seized the moment to reiterate his warnings about the fate of the cryptocurrency.\n\nFallout from the Bitcoin ETF Launch\n\nDespite high expectations surrounding the debut of the first spot BTC ETF in the U.S., BTC fell short of meeting projections, prompting Peter Schiff to assert an \u2018I told you so\u2019 sentiment. Schiff, known for his skepticism of BTC, had previously cautioned about the \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 sentiment. Now, he contends that the crypto industry is downplaying the significance of the decline, dismissing it as a predictable event.\n\nSchiff\u2019s Perspective on Bitcoin\u2019s Value\n\nRestating his conviction that BTC\u2019s value will ultimately drop to zero, Schiff argues that the approved spot Bitcoin ETFs aren\u2019t creating new demand but merely shifting existing demand. He suggests that investors who might have otherwise invested in actual BTC or related equities are now opting for the new ETFs, resulting in a redistribution of demand. Schiff uses the metaphor of rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship to emphasize that such actions won\u2019t prevent the inevitable decline of the asset.\n\nThe Debate: $0 or $10 Million for Bitcoin\n\nIn the ongoing discourse about Bitcoin\u2019s future value, Schiff makes a bold prediction. He suggests that regardless of how low Bitcoin\u2019s price falls, its proponents will always assert its superiority over gold. Even in scenarios where BTC drops to $100 in 2031 and gold rises to $10,000, Schiff believes that BTC supporters will argue a 100x increase in the past 20 years compared to gold\u2019s 5x.\n\nNo matter how low the price of #Bitcoin falls, its proponents will always be able to claim its outperformed #gold. For example, even if Bitcoin falls to $100 in 2031 and gold rises to $10,000, they will claim that Bitcoin is up 100x in the past 20 years, while gold is only up 5x. \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 26, 2024\n\nAddressing the Possibility of a $10 Million Bitcoin\n\nWhen confronted with the hypothetical scenario of BTC reaching $10 million by 2031, Schiff deflects the discussion by pointing to the potential demise of the U.S. dollar. He proposes that if the U.S. dollar undergoes hyperinflation similar to the German Papiermark, then a $10 million BTC could become plausible.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s journey is marked by challenges and controversies, with opinions on its future value remaining divided. Schiff\u2019s persistent critique, rooted in skepticism and a longstanding belief in Bitcoin\u2019s eventual demise, contributes to the ongoing debate. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, the scrutiny from investors, enthusiasts, and critics intensifies, awaiting pivotal developments that will define BTC\u2019s trajectory in the coming years.\n\nAlso Read: US Government to Sell $130M Worth of Bitcoin From Silk Road"

        "content": "The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) reportedly received its first spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) application just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first spot BTC ETF in the United States.\n\nHarvest Hong Kong \u2014 one of China\u2019s largest fund managers \u2014 submitted a spot Bitcoin ETF application to the Hong Kong SFC on Jan. 26, reported Tencent News. The report added that the regulatory body is actively working to expedite the process for approval of ETFs in the country to launch the first Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETF after the Chinese New Year on Feb. 10.\n\nAccording to the report, the Hong Kong regulatory body may follow a similar approach to the U.S. SEC and approve multiple spot ETFs to ensure a level playing field. While Harvest Fund might be the first applicant to file for a spot BTC ETF, it may not be the only one. Several regional financial institutions have signaled their interest in launching a spot BTC ETF in 2024.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Jan. 19, at least 10 financial institutions in the country are actively working to launch a spot BTC ETF. Financial giant such as Venture Smart Financial Holdings have already set the first quarter of 2024 as their target to launch the spot ETF.\n\nRelated: BlockShow unites with BlockDown for a crypto festival in Hong Kong.\n\nSeveral existing crypto companies that launched futures-based crypto ETFs in Hong Kong are also expected to be among spot Bitcoin ETF filers. \u200b\u200bSamsung Asset Management, which launched the Samsung Bitcoin Futures ETF in 2023, reportedly said it wouldn\u2019t \u201celiminate the possibility of exploring to launch a spot ETF.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has emerged as one of the leading crypto destinations in Asia thanks to its regulator\u2019s pro-crypto approach in 2023. The SFC created crypto-focused regulations in 2023, allowing institutional and retail investors to participate in crypto activities. Even before the U.S. SEC approved the first spot BTC ETF, the Hong Kong SFC opened the door for crypto-based ETFs and expressed its readiness to receive applications for the authorization of various funds, including digital asset spot ETFs and existing crypto futures ETFs.\n\nMagazine: Hong Kong\u2019s annoying new \u2018Travel Rule\u2019, $1.14B of 3AC\u2019s assets frozen: Asia Express"

        "content": "While broker-dealers can now allow their financial advisors to sell a new spot-bitcoin exchange-traded fund, firms still have plenty of work to perform regarding the product, according to senior brokerage executives who spoke Tuesday morning at an industry conference.\n\nOn January 11, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its approval to 11 bitcoin ETFs, and they\u2019re up and trading on public exchanges.\n\nSome firms were early adopters. For example, Wells Fargo Advisors, with close to 12,000 financial advisors across various business channels, said this month that it was selling new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but only when a customer asked for the security in a nonsolicited trade, or without any prompting from a salesperson.\n\nBut other firms are much more tentative, according to executives who spoke Monday at the Financial Services Institute\u2019s annual meeting, OneVoice, in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\u201cWhen new structures come out, it presents new challenges,\u201d said Matt Fries, head of investment products and partner solutions at Cetera Financial Group. \u201cIt\u2019s daunting because there is so much innovation occurring with investment products.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re scrambling to figure out spot-bitcoin ETFs right now,\u201d said Fries, who was speaking on a panel titled, \u201cIncluding Alternative Investments in Mainstream Portfolio Allocations.\u201d \u201cThat wasn\u2019t something that was on my mind a month ago, but now I\u2019m writing a policy on how we\u2019re going to handle these.\u201d\n\nCetera Financial Group is developing training for its financial advisors regarding the product, he added.\n\nBroker-dealers typically have tight restrictions on trading volatile products such as futures and options contracts, which require special training at many firms. Volatile alternative asset classes, including currencies and metals, also face strict limitations in client portfolios. Spot-bitcoin ETFs are facing that same kind of scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to stay ahead of this kind of stuff even when you are trying to stay ahead of it,\u201d said Seth Miller, general counsel at Cambridge Investment Research Inc. He said that while he had anticipated the SEC\u2019s decision to approve spot-bitcoin ETFs, it still took a week to introduce training for financial advisors who were interested in the product.\n\nMeanwhile, one Cambridge financial advisor was admonishing Miller over email to hurry and immediately approve trading of the new ETFs, Miller said. \u201cWhen I look at other executives in this position, I ask, were you unprepared or were you just cautious?\u201d\n\n[More: Bitcoin ETFs in 401(k)s a useful diversifier, proponents say]"

        "title": "Vanguard Got Bitcoin Right - Morningstar",
        "content": "As you probably heard, the SEC has approved the creation of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Until now, Bitcoin purchasers either needed to create \"wallets\" on a cryptocurrency exchange or buy shares of a fund called Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nThe latter's structure was unattractive. Whereas ETFs' prices reliably match those of their underlying assets, Grayscale's often did not. (That no longer holds: Once the SEC lifted its ban, Grayscale promptly converted its fund into an ETF.)\n\nAs the Grayscale fund also carried a much higher expense ratio than the ETF newcomers, Bitcoin owners have become doubly fortunate. They can now hold their cryptocurrency in cheap, well-regulated funds, without worrying whether their crypto exchange will be the next to be seized or whether they have lost their wallet\u2019s password. Operationally, there has never been a better time to hold Bitcoin.\n\nVanguard's Dissent\n\nNot, however, for Vanguard customers.\n\nNot only has the company forsworn creating a Bitcoin ETF, but it refuses to carry anybody else's Bitcoin funds on its brokerage platform. Those wishing to purchase cryptocurrencies must go elsewhere.\n\nNaturally, this decision angered Bitcoin enthusiasts, but it delighted me. That reaction is not personal. I would not buy cryptocurrencies myself, as they are speculations rather than investments (if an asset cannot generate cash, under any circumstance, then there's no reason to hold it except for the hope to sell to a higher bidder), but I do not begrudge others doing so.\n\nRead More: Is Bitcoin Ungovernable?\n\nThe Right Side of History\n\nMy conviction instead is, as Michael Corleone would say, strictly business. Throughout its history, Vanguard has often refused to go where others had trod:\n\n1) Government-plus funds. Such funds, which supplemented their \"income\" (the extra payouts were in fact capital gains) by selling call options on their bonds, were the industry's success story in the mid-1980s.\n\n2) Tactical-allocation funds. Following 1987\u2032s Black Monday debacle, competitors promptly launched funds that boasted of their flexibility. Unlike traditional asset-allocation funds, they would be able to dodge the next stock market crash.\n\n3) Short-term multimarket income funds. Don't ask. But they were the most popular new fund category in the early 1990s.\n\n4) Internet funds. The rage of the late 1990s. What artificial intelligence investing is today, internet funds were 25 years ago.\n\n5) 130/30 Funds. Once again, do not ask.\n\nAll of the above crashed and burned. The first group failed so badly that it hibernated for 30 years, before being revived recently as \"covered call\" bond funds (I need to write a column about those). The third and fifth vanished entirely. Tactical-allocation funds have haltingly survived, while performing poorly \u2013 on average, an annualised 2 percentage points behind traditional allocation funds. Finally, although internet funds eventually righted their ship after the 2000-02 technology-stock implosion, they possessed few shareholders while doing so.\n\nVanguard offered none of those funds. In each case, the organisation could quickly have sold additional shares, as those investments were much in demand. In each case, Vanguard demurred. Doing so benefited its business far more than collecting a few billion dollars of incremental assets. Investors realised which fund companies had burned them \u2013 and which hadn't. Over time, they might have forgotten the details. But they remembered how they had been treated.\n\nIs Bitcoin Different?\n\nTo be sure, Vanguard wasn't standing alone. Fidelity and Schwab (SCHW) also eschewed such funds, for example. But Vanguard took investor protections several steps further. Thus, while Fidelity and Schwab each launched no-transaction-fee fund platforms that gave investors what they wanted, albeit at the cost of steep underlying fees, Vanguard abstained, on the grounds that customers did not always know what was bad for them. The company has also on occasion warned investors away from its most popular funds. One prominent example was Vanguard Growth Index (VIGRX). In the late 1990s, investors who inquired about that fund received cautionary letters along with the fund's prospectus.\n\nIt may be protested that Bitcoin is a different animal than Vanguard's previous abstentions. Whereas the aforementioned funds were either gimmicky or very narrowly defined (few internet stocks existed in the 1990s), Bitcoin is a straightforward and reasonably mainstream asset. Its proponents regard it as digital gold, a commodity that serves as a store of value.\n\nIf so, Vanguard could conceivably be called hypocritical. Although the company offers only a single commodities fund, Vanguard Commodity Strategy (VCMDX), many from other organisations are available on its brokerage platform. If you seek ETFs that invest in gold bullion or barrels of oil, Vanguard does sell them.\n\nFine by me. First, simply calling Bitcoin \"digital gold\" does not make it so. Physical gold broke even during 2022\u2032s financials-market meltdown, while Bitcoin's price collapsed. As The Wall Street Journal's James Mackintosh tartly puts it, \"so far there is zero evidence that Bitcoin works as digital gold\". Second, that is not the point. In Vanguard's judgment, cryptocurrency is currently unsuitable for its clients. In the future, that may change. But its ruling is for the here and now.\n\nVanguard is Following the Bogle Mindset\n\nIt's unfair to expect today's Vanguard to act as its founder Jack Bogle would have done. Businesses cannot be managed on hypotheticals. In this instance, admittedly, there is no doubt about Jack's opinion. (Counselled Bogle: \"avoid Bitcoin like the plague.\") That detail, however, is irrelevant. What matters is Vanguard obeys not the letter of Bogle's law but its spirit.\n\nThe company's decision to exclude Bitcoin ETFs meets that standard. Whether Vanguard has selected the right ground onto which to make its stand remains to be seen. What matters is the mindset. Vanguard became the world's largest fund company partly because its management knew when to say no. That it remains willing to do so is a positive sign for the company's financial health \u2013 and for those of its clients."

        "title": "Swan Bitcoin Unveils Its Newly Formed Mining Business Unit - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Swan Bitcoin recently unveiled its newly formed Bitcoin Mining Business Unit as the parent company of the Bitcoin Financial Services Firm aims to go public within the next 12 months. Joining us now to discuss is Haa Zag, the chief investment officer at Swan Bitcoin and head of Swan Mining. Hello, Haa. Hey John, how are you doing? I'm very good. Thank you. I just came back from a week long vacation, so I'm just fully relaxed and ready to have this conversation. How are you doing? Very good, very good. I just came back from a week long business trip. So there's a lot happening at Swan as you know, one of us is more relaxed than the other. But yeah, but we're going to have a great conversation here. Uh Talk to us about this newly announced mining unit and the plan to go public in the next 12 months. Yeah. No, it's, it's super exciting times for us at Swan and I'll tell you like, I've done a lot of things in my career. This is probably like the, the wildest one by by far we build the mining operation in pretty much record time in six months, we, we went from zero to a little bit about 4.5 x of hashes and accounting. We have machines acquired in order to go above eight. So it's been super, super exciting. But this is all part of something bigger. We've been developing swan institutional and expanding Swan institutional throughout the last year. And mining is of course, one of the the biggest parts of that so far, talk to me a little bit about the decision that went into the mining unit. What kind of decisions were you making behind the scenes? What kind of conversations were being had and what ultimately led to Swan saying? Ok, this is a business we want to get into. Yeah, this actually started even before mining. So as we know it, one business of just buy, letting clients buy Bitcoin, right? We don't even have a sell button. So clients just buy Bitcoin with us is a business that the long term rates are gonna go to zero. And actually we're gonna be driving that trend towards rates, going, going to zero and fees going to zero, right? So long term, this is a product that has a marginal cost that it's close to zero. And as we know anything that has marginal cost close to zero in the in a long enough time frame, it runs to zero. So we've been for a while thinking about sources of diversification of revenue for for Swan and there are a lot of different fronts we're working on. Uh But if you look at Swan, one of the things that it's really, really strong with the company is our brand and the talents that we attract. Uh So through last year, we had massive amount of conversations and there are different areas that we're talking about, you know, investors coming to us, clients, coming to us and mining was something that was always recurring and coming back. So we started around June of last year, looking at passive investment in a mining company. And through the process of analyzing that, you know, we got more and more excited about certain things that we were seeing in the mining industry, you know, from the margins to seeing where it was in the cycle to see where the other companies were and said, well, why not make a move here and see if we can raise capital to actually go into mining, right? And it started small uh but quite very quickly, we were go to secure, I think a good amount of capital we started deploying and you know, the rest is history. We are where we are. But uh along this path, we developed Swan Institutional. So mining is part of Swan Institutional and inside Swan Institutional, we have different things as well. We're doing asset management, we're gonna be doing Bitcoin back lending. Um We're doing in investment management with, with clients uh you know, launching an R A uh there's an uh starting to have something that looks and feels a lot like investment banking that we're building inside the institutional. So, again, super, super exciting times for us. Uh I keep saying that a lot of the things that I'm seeing on the, on the Bitcoin space right now, they go back to what I saw in the banking industry, like in the late nineties, early two thousands, a lot of talent coming in a lot of opportunity. Uh And yes, so this is how, how we got where we are. Um And as I said, it's, it's great to see, you know, that the team was able to deliver, implement everything in record amount of time. And, you know, super excited for this year. Have I want to talk about your experience in trad I in just a second. But I have to ask you why diversify into mining when all the mining companies are diversifying and looking at other ways to supplement their business, it feels a little bit backwards when we, we look at this at face value. Yeah. And I think, you know, when you look at what we did and when we started timing is everything, right? So when we started ASIC prices were like in the bottom of the bottom, right? So we're looking at the machine prices and thinking about acquiring. So we had the opportunity to buy machines or, you know, top notch machines, high quality machines at very low historical prices. When you look at the, the the public mining companies or the mining companies have been around, some of these have been buying, you know, machine as at like 90 $100 per terra has. And we are looking at machines, you know, at 12 $15 per tera has so significantly lower. So it got very attractive to us to acquire machines and to build the fleet at those prices. The other thing is we were able to secure capital at a very, very low cost. It's like a capital that looks much more like equity. So we shared the upside, it's segregated from Swan. So it made a lot of sense sense for us as a company to build something like that where, you know, we have an upside on an industry that we like, we want to be close to. We're getting, we think at the very low end of the cycle, you know, and looking ahead at where we think Bitcoin prices are gonna be. It's a leverage play in Bitcoin at the end of the day. Right. And we're here exactly for that. Where do you think Bitcoin prices are going? Yeah. You know, I don't make predictions after being in Bitcoin, let me write to you said, where you think the Bitcoin prices are going to be now you much higher, significantly higher. So I, well, I'll tell you this, I wrote, uh there's another thing that we've built last year, which is called Nakamoto portfolio.com. Uh It's a set of tools from Swan that financial advisors can come in, can put portfolios in, can see how Bitcoin would react on their portfolios, how much they should size the allocation of Bitcoin. But there is one piece in there that is called the Schroeder model. Uh where I compare Bitcoin with different asset classes. And what would happen if Bitcoin captured the monetary premium of assets like gold real estate even at very small amounts. And if you run the numbers there, you can see that, you know, the potential for Bitcoin prices are significantly higher than, than where we are, you know, orders of magnitude higher. Now, on price predictions, it's very, very hard to predict prices in Bitcoin, right? And I guarantee that anybody making a price prediction is going to be wrong. Uh Eventually they're all gonna be right at some point. But in the short term, knowing exactly when things are gonna happen is just, it's, it's impossible because it's a very, very small asset. You know, it's we're in the infancy of the uh of Bitcoin and trying to see, you know, where you're gonna see the supply and demand changing. It's just very, very hard to do at this point. Now, from uh the mining units perspective, how are you preparing for the having we know the having is coming up in Q two this year, rewards are gonna be slashed in half from a business perspective. How are you looking at that? Yeah, I think as I said, one of the advantages we have is that we have a very new fleet since we bought machines throughout last year, our machines are very efficient. We're able also to secure low energy costs in most of our sites. So if we look, that was part of all of our calculations as we were going through these sites and look at energy cost for us, right? First thing that came to our mind is like, OK, so what happens, we know we're profitable before the having, what happens after the having and not only after the next having, what happens after the following having? Right. So we're building the business with all of these things in mind. And the obvious thing is we need to the efficiency in machines. That's something that we're gonna have to uh improve a long time, but securing low energy costs. That's the the key for being a sustainable miner in the long term. And so far, I think we have some very good contracts in hand. I want to talk about Swan's financial services business now, you know, we just got the approval of the spot, Bitcoin ETF in the United States that's had a ripple effect on Bitcoin and crypto services across the globe. Have you seen any new interest from um from customers since the approval of the ETF or how has that affected business over at Swan. Yeah. Uh, like this is, it, it's game changing, I think for all of us. Right. I'll tell you, as you said, coming from the thread. I part of the world, uh, don't, don't hold that against me, but that's what I did. Uh, I'm starting to see a lot of people that had no interest in Bitcoin for a long period of time. You know, Cio s of big banks that I've known they're starting to ask questions around. Ok, so I see the ETF is out there now, maybe it's something I should be allocating to my client's portfolio. How should I think about sizing it fundamentally asking questions about Bitcoin. Why do I see Bitcoin, you know, is the best asset to have in a portfolio in the long term as the best collect that you can have. So definitely, I would say in terms of the the the change in interest and demand um that that's changing significantly, right? If you think about it, we now have the biggest asset managers in the world all making marketing for Bitcoin, right? We're gonna have Bitcoin in ads everywhere. Um They are all trying to sell their own ETS. But at the end of the day, there's one thing in common, they're all selling Bitcoin, they have to talk about the fundamentals of the assets, right? And when we look at where we are in the in the macro cycle, I think as I said, it's the perfect assets to, to hold and it will capture the vast amount of the monetary premium that we've seen flowing to assets for the last, you know, several decades. Right? I want to get your opinion on this. It's a question that's come up since the approval of the ETF some folks are saying, you know, this, this brings an aspect of centralization to Bitcoin that there wasn't before we're going to have large asset managers, many of them um from the trad five world holding large amounts of Bitcoin. How do you think of that? And if you are going to tell one of your trad five friends who are now interested in Bitcoin about what's going on? Uh What, what would you say? Yeah, I think, you know, the first of all talking about the concentration, it is a risk, right? And uh what we want to see in Bitcoin and part of why also we went into mining is to provide diversification and everything, right? So we need to have diversification in terms of wallets, addresses, you know, the users and everything else. Uh I'm not that worried in the long term about having a large player, a substantial part of it coin because that doesn't give them any power right? At the end of the day, the nodes are the ones that run the code and the ones that's really determine where Bitcoin is gonna be heading. Uh We've seen that again already in the in the block size wars. Right. So, even if uh Blackrock or whoever it is has 10% of Bitcoins, which they won't. Right. Uh It's not a problem at all. It's not like they can, this is not proof of stake where they can vote with, uh, with their shares, their shares, just give them economic expo exposure, but it doesn't give them any voting rights to anything in Bitcoin. So, on that, on that aspect, I'm not worried at all. You know, there's some talk about, well, maybe they can drive, uh, a fork at some point again, not worried about that. I think the money and the forks will flow through where they need. And we've seen there's enough historical evidence, that's where, where we're going to be heading, right? Um, when I talk to my thread, five friends and, you know, when they come to questions for me, it's funny like a lot of them are still in the early days. You're still asking like the questions that most of us had maybe 567 years ago. Uh, can governments ban it? Right? Can I buy less than one Bitcoin? How do I do self custody? It's actually good to see that a lot of them that actually have interest on the, on the ETF or asking? Ok. So I, I got into the ETF but I heard about it. I can also hold my Bitcoin. How do I do that? And that's part of trying to get them to understand how to do it and how to do self custody. Right? Uh Again, I think it's the, that's the beauty of Bitcoin is an asset that you can hold yourself different than anything else that, uh you know, we, we've ever seen, let's, let's uh take a little walk down memory lane and, and draw on your experience as a banker in the traditional finance world. If you gather up all that experience and your experience in the crypto world, where do you envision the intersection of Trad and crypto heading? How are these two areas of the financial world going to coexist in the future, do you think? Yeah, I think, you know, uh definitely, as I said, in the beginning, we're seeing a shift where traditional people that were in the traditional system, they are moving towards, I think Bitcoin and uh and trying to understand, you know, how it works. And I think everything that we saw being built on the traditional system, it's going to replicate and it's going to be replicated better on a Bitcoin standard. So that means that, you know, from custody as we discussed through asset allocation, through lending, these are all businesses that people are going to be doing over Bitcoin, right? And this is exactly why we created Swan Institutional is to leverage that and to build on that and to help clients to to get an understanding how to do, right? So we're looking at uh you know, financing and E A transactions in Bitcoin. We're looking at asset allocation, Bitcoin, same areas that the banks have built. So we look at, you know, I worked at gold money. We had GS AM that did asset management, right? We had investment banking and it's the same thing. We're rebuilding the same thing, but on the Bitcoin standard. Um and I think it's gonna be better, it's gonna be faster. it's gonna be, you know, the 10 X, what we we've seen in the past and as a new, any new industry, the exciting part of all of this, it's the only the things that we haven't even envisioned that are gonna happen, right? Uh The fact that you have something that is decentralized, that it's much faster that it's outside of traditional rails uh gives us a lot of opportunities that we probably haven't even thought about and are going to be happening, which again that occurs in any new technology, right? And whenever a new technology is created, everybody thinks about the applications comparing to what the last technologies were were around, right? We saw that with the internet where when email came in, people just thought about, you know, the internet is being in place for email where this will be the new post office, the electronic post office. And they couldn't envision there was much more to that, that, you know, the worldwide web would be developed and it's the same thing with Bitcoin. I think we are in the email area of Bitcoin and we are going to be saying, you know, applications that are gonna blow our minds in the, in the next few decades around it. And this is why value it's, you know, it's so depressed right now because the, the upside is much bigger than you can imagine have what we gotta wrap soon. But I have to ask you, is there a risk in your opinion that we replicate some of the bad parts of the tra traditional financial system in this new system that we're building. And if there is a risk, I see you nodding along. How do we start to think about uh avoiding that? Yeah, there are risks and that has happened and it has been happening a lot, right? Uh people trying to capture Bitcoin, um I think the beauty of it, it is definitely something that keeps me up at night thinking about, you know, what the risks would be, is this going to become an asset that is centralized, you know, within governments and it can only get in on ramps and off ramps or centralized, right? Uh It's all temporary, Jen, I think at the end of the day, they're gonna try it, right? They've tried in different ways, right? Bitcoin has been, how many times it has been banned in China? How many times Bitcoin mining has been banned in China, right? And the reality is that this is open source. It's decentralized. It's a software that anybody can run in a computer. It's just unstoppable. So I think everything that we're gonna see and we are gonna see. I think barriers that we're gonna have to overcome eventually in a long enough time frame, they're all gonna be gone. Haa, thanks so much for joining the show this morning. It was a pleasure chatting with you. My pleasure. Thank you. That was Chief Investment Officer at Swan Bitcoin and head of Swan Mining Haffa Zachary."

        "title": "Will Schwab Launch Its Own Bitcoin ETF? - ThinkAdvisor",
        "content": "What You Need to Know Bitcoin ETFs will be ubiquitous, Ric Edelman predicted.\n\nSchwab could be a low-cost competitor when and if it offers its own spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nEric Balchunas expects Schwab to file for a spot bitcoin ETF within a year.\n\nIt could take a year or more before Charles Schwab introduces its own spot bitcoin ETF, which market experts expect the giant asset manager to do eventually. And it could make a big splash when and if it does.\n\nSchwab typically isn\u2019t the first to enter new categories, analysts note. In the meantime, the company can reap the benefits of offering all the new spot bitcoin ETFs developed by other asset managers and approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission this month, including funds from Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nSchwab, as a \u201cfinancial supermarket,\u201d has good reasons to avoid or delay entering the spot bitcoin ETF fracas, according to Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\nRemaining Agnostic\n\n\u201cThey pride themselves on making available an array of products and services to both investors and advisors that allow them to cater to the largest number possible. So by making available all 11 of these new spot bitcoin ETFs, Schwab is able to remain agnostic,\u201d Edelman told ThinkAdvisor on Monday.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to put themselves in a position of promoting a particular product or even promoting the asset class. They can simply stand above the fray and make it clear to their investors and advisors that the products are available for them to select as they wish,\u201d he added.\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst, sees Schwab potentially introducing its own spot bitcoin ETF within a year.\n\nSchwab and Fidelity are \u201calways looking to stay in competition with each other, and so as Fidelity gets more and more success with their bitcoin ETF, it may start to torture Schwab,\u201d Balchunas said.\n\n\u201cUnlike Vanguard, they\u2019re not anti-crypto at all. In fact, they have a crypto thematic ETF. So we know they\u2019re open to it. \u2026 And then there\u2019s just the fact that they generally enter categories late. They\u2019re never the first,\u201d the Bloomberg analyst said in an interview with ThinkAdvisor on Monday.\n\nA Competititve Splash?\n\n\u201cSo those are the reasons I could see them coming in with something and I could see them being really cheap. I mean, they do enter late, but when they enter, they usually make a splash with the lower fee,\u201d Balchunas added. He predicted the company would at least file an application for a spot bitcoin ETF within 12 months, noting he was only speculating.\n\n\u201cThe timetable in this new category always seems sped up to me versus normal time. It just feels like it\u2019s been like six months since they launched and it\u2019s been two weeks,\u201d Balchunas added. As Schwab sees demand for Fidelity and BlackRock spot bitcoin ETFs on its platform, there would be no reason for the brokerage not to develop its own, he said.\n\nFidelity and BlackRock already have gathered $2 billion in assets for their new bitcoin ETFs, Balchunas noted. \u201cThat\u2019s strong for two weeks. It\u2019s more than strong \u2026 That happens never, to be honest.\u201d\n\nSchwab doesn\u2019t comment on speculation, a spokeswoman said Monday.\n\nSchwab has no need to launch its own ETF in this category, according to Edelman, who nonetheless expects most all ETF sponsors to eventually offer crypto products.\n\nBy staying above the fray while offering other companies\u2019 spot bitcoin ETFs, Schwab reinforces its objectivity and the investment community\u2019s ability to obtain and execute any strategy they wish on Schwab\u2019s platform \u201cwithout worrying that there are limitations that could interfere with the preferences of the investors or advisors,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nAs for a delayed entry, Edelman added, \u201cit makes sense for Schwab to wait and see what market reaction is to these new products. Is there demand? Is there sufficient asset flow to justify the effort of creating your own investment option?\u201d\n\nEdelman noted that \u201cthere\u2019s been a race to the bottom\u201d as spot bitcoin ETF providers, in an effort to win assets under management, are offering fees as low as 19 basis points, with many waiving fees for as much as a year."

        "title": "Grayscale GBTC exodus shakes up Bitcoin market dynamics - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A new market report from Bitfinex suggests that a sizable sell-off of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares, partly driven by bankrupt exchange FTX, significantly impacted Bitcoin\u2019s recent price drop in January 2024.\n\nAccording to the latest market update from Bitfinex Alpha, the realization of profits following Grayscale\u2019s successful conversion of its GBTC trust to an ETF was a significant influence on the marketwide correction that took BTC from $48,700 to $38,600 in a matter of days.\n\nGBTC and BlackRock\u2019s IBIT spot ETF flows reflect the largest total positive and negative flows for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Source: etf.com/Bitfinex Alpha\n\nBitfinex head of derivatives Jag Kooner unpacked the finer details of report in correspondence with Cointelegraph. Kooner emphasizes the significant \u201cdiscount\u201d afforded to GBTC investors as a primary driver for the high volume of share selling in recent weeks:\n\n\u201cThe discount was over 50% during the bear market lows in late 2022, and it\u2019s non-existent now because of arbitrage traders. This was one of the most expected results of spot ETFs rolling out, which means these investors have been waiting for a long time to realize these profits,\u201d Kooner explains.\n\nThe report highlights $4.3 billion outflows following GBTC\u2019s conversion to a spot Bitcoin ETF on Jan. 16. Conversely, the highest net inflows for an individual spot Bitcoin ETF were to BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), attracting $1.82 billion.\n\nRelated: Fidelity Bitcoin ETF rakes in reported $208M, offsetting Grayscale outflows alone\n\nBitfinex analysts also draw attention to the impact of ETF flows on the BTC price, illustrated by the fact that there was no flow of funds into the respective spot Bitcoin ETF on Saturday, Jan. 20.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC remains the largest Bitcoin ETF, with its total assets under management hovering around the $24 billion mark despite dropping from $28.6 billion before its conversion.\n\nFTX sells GBTC shares as ETF fee battle begins\n\nThe Bitfinex report also notes that converting Grayscale\u2019s trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF facilitated the sale of significant shares held by bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. FTX sold 22 million GBTC shares, valued at nearly $1 billion, completely liquidating its shares.\n\nAnother factor highlighted by Bitfinex Alpha is the impact of spot BTC ETF fees. Kooner noted that Grayscale\u2019s competitors currently charge fees ranging from 0.2% to 0.9%, while it charges 1.5%:\n\n\u201cThis difference in fees has incentivized investors to move their funds from GBTC to lower-cost Bitcoin ETF options. Additionally, multiple other ETF filings have waived off fees for the first year, further incentivizing a migration from GBTC to other products.\u201d\n\nData reflects a cooling of trading volume between Bitcoin ETF funds toward the end of January 2024. Source: Bitfinex Alpha/CryptoQuant.\n\nKooner said that investors are looking for more cost-effective ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which has impacted the shift of capital within the nascent Bitcoin ETF space. As January draws to a close, ETF data suggests that the movement of capital between the various ETF funds is beginning to settle.\n\n\"The daily outflows are reducing on a daily basis but are still quite high at an average of around $450 million per day. Unless there is change in fee structure, outflows are expected to continue,\" Kooner adds.\n\nThe Bitfinex head of derivatives concluded by highlighting that large GBTC investors who bought shares at a 50% discount over the past two years would realize profits on an earlier timeline than other investors, which is indicative of the trading behavior in January.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?"

(SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nMarket shifts focus to ether\n\nAhmad said that the market had initially priced in the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF. Once this became a reality, attention turned to ethereum. He highlighted a price increase of around 10% to 12% for ether after the approval of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs, indicating that ethereum is now in the spotlight for the next potential ETF approval.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It is difficult to forecast whether ether will outperform bitcoin because now that bitcoin has an ETF wrapper, there is potentially more demand,\" Ahmad said. Bitcoin has seen increased demand due to its newfound accessibility through ETFs.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nTaking a longer-term view, he expects bitcoin to continue performing well and experiencing a price increase as it becomes more widely accessible to the mass market.\n\nAhmad also observed that fund managers such as BlackRock (BLK), who filed an application for a spot ether ETF with the SEC in November 2023, might pave the way for the market to gain access to baskets of crypto assets within ETF wrappers in the future.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF a 'sell the news' event\n\nAlthough the price of bitcoin has decreased from a post-ETF approval peak of over $48,000 to its current value of around $42,000, investors remain optimistic that spot Bitcoin ETFs will pave the way for mainstream capital to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: US crypto crackdown 'an opportunity for the UK'\n\nDespite the short-term fluctuations, Ahmad said: \"In the medium to longer-term, we will see a stabilization and long-term positive tailwinds for Bitcoin price action and volume activity going forward.\"\n\nPossibility of another rate pause\n\nSwitching gears to the macroeconomic perspective, Ahmad discussed the potential for a US interest rate pause and its implications for investor confidence in capital allocation strategies. He pointed out that after a rapid increase in rates following 15 years of near-zero interest rates, the market is now likely to experience another rate pause at this week's US Federal Reserve meeting.\n\nThis pause may provide investors, particularly those dealing with risk assets like bitcoin and digital assets, with more confidence to allocate capital to this asset class, according to Ahmad.\n\nWatch: Turning real assets into tokens on blockchain has $15 trillion market potential | Future Focus\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Portal, a fintech provider advancing financial self-sovereignty with robust technology for seamless access to Bitcoin and diverse cryptocurrency markets, today announced it has exited stealth mode and raised $34 million in seed funding. Investors that participated in the round include Coinbase Ventures, Arrington Capital, OKX Ventures and Gate.io, as well as many other high-profile fintech and crypto investors. The seed funding builds on Portal\u2019s angel round of $8.5 million, which closed in 2021.\n\nThe new funding comes at a pivotal moment for the crypto industry as it grapples with the security risks and fragmentation inherent in cross-chain bridges, centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). In fact, over the last two years, approximately $2.5 billion has been stolen from bridges alone by hackers, according to Token Terminal, with prominent hacks of bridges such as Wormhole, HECO/HTX, Nomad, Harmony, Multichain, BNB bridge and Orbit. With few alternative cross-trading solutions on the market, users are forced to rely on highly centralized, opaque and risky swapping solutions like wrappers, bridges and custodians.\n\n\u201cBridges, centralized exchanges and other custodial solutions that enable cross-chain exchange have been vulnerable and insecure for as long as they have existed,\u201d said Chandra Duggirala, co-founder and CEO of Portal. \u201cFrom the very early days of Mt. Gox to FTX, centralized exchanges have been a persistent source of risk to user funds. Now, the risk remains, but it has taken a new form in bridges and other custodial cross-chain solutions. Portal intends to solve the problem of custodial risk once and for all using secure and transparent Layer 2 atomic swap technology. With the support of our investors, we look forward to introducing cross-chain infrastructure that finally enables users to execute trades quickly and safely.\u201d\n\nThrough its novel, decentralized and trust-minimized infrastructure, Portal is building a solution that will enable peer-to-peer swapping of Bitcoin across a range of blockchains without the need for dangerous intermediaries like wrappers, bridges, CEXs and multi-hop DEXs. As a staking and swapping layer, interoperability layer and execution layer, Portal\u2019s infrastructure will enable any user to swap Bitcoin across a range of blockchains and back in seconds without giving up custody, privacy or security.\n\nPortal will use the funds to develop its two flagship products: Portal DEX and Portal Wallet. Portal DEX is the first Bitcoin-based exchange that enables Layer 2 atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies across blockchains at greater speed, lower cost and with increased transparency, security and interoperability. Portal Wallet is a fully non-custodial tool that integrates Portal DEX and allows users to receive, store and send cryptocurrencies across blockchains.\n\nIn the coming months, Portal will launch several new groundbreaking products previously only available to large institutions and hedge funds. They include an AI-powered, co-pilot investment application for acquiring financial intelligence and maximizing high-level investment strategies; and an API integration tool for building Portal DEX cross-chain swap functionality into existing wallets, DeFi applications on any chain and Web3 DApps. Portal will also be announcing several strategic partnerships with major Bitcoin projects to enhance the utility and accessibility of Bitcoin, which have been bottlenecks for the crypto community.\n\n\u201cPortal is pioneering what DeFi on Bitcoin looks like and we are thrilled to be supporting this team that continues to deliver,\u201d said Michael Arrington, founder and partner of Arrington Capital. \u201cPortal is rapidly pushing ahead the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling fast and low-cost economic activity without being beholden to third parties.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s 12-month volatility is the lowest on record, analysts say.\n\nUS Bitcoin spot ETFs are expected to continue smoothing the asset\u2019s price fluctuations over a longer time frame.\n\nBitcoin is becoming calmer. It\u2019s a trend that will entrench itself as US exchange-traded funds proliferate.\n\nBitcoin volatility is down\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 12-month annualised volatility has hit its lowest levels in 12 years, according to Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at wealth management firm Creative Planning.\n\nWhile there are fluctuations year-to-year, the overall trajectory shows a decline from a high of 179% in January 2012 to 45% in January 2024, according to Bilello\u2019s data.\n\nVolatility has been a hallmark of the asset class since inception, drawing investors eager to leverage its fluctuations for potential gains and simultaneously deterring those averse to risk.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 12-month annualised volatility serves as an indicator, reflecting the extent of the crypto\u2019s price fluctuations over a year-long period.\n\nA higher percentage denotes greater price variability, signalling increased market unpredictability, while a lower figure suggests more stable trading conditions.\n\n\u201cLess volatility could mean more long-term holders,\u201d Bradley Park, web3 analyst at onchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, told DL News.\n\nAppearing on Peter McCormack\u2019s \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did\u201d podcast earlier this month, Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, and Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said the introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs will further dampen volatility.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cA huge amount of it [Bitcoin] will sit in adviser accounts. They don\u2019t want to trade every day,\u201d Thorn said.\n\nSeyffart agreed, saying advisers with set target portfolio allocations would slash volatility while increasing fund returns.\n\nOver time, the value of assets in a portfolio changes due to market fluctuations. This can cause the actual allocation of an asset within a portfolio to drift away from its target.\n\nFor example, if Bitcoin\u2019s value increases significantly, it might comprise a larger percentage of the portfolio than intended, triggering rebalancing that\u2019s typically conducted quarterly or annually.\n\nIf the portfolio, for example, has a target allocation of 5% and Bitcoin surging by 80%, then advisers are likely to be selling their assets to avoid the cryptocurrency getting an outsized share of the portfolio, Seyffart said.\n\nIf Bitcoin \u201ctanks 80% they\u2019re going to be buying it to get it back to whatever their allocation is. They\u2019re going to try to keep that allocation at 5%,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is up 0.48% in the last 24 hours as of 11.50pm GMT, trading at $42,236.\n\nEthereum rose 0.43% in the same period, now at $2,266.\n\nAvalanche and Solana are down 3.43% and 1.22%, respectively.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nSebastian Sinclair is a markets correspondent for DL News.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nA British-Chinese woman has gone on trial for laundering bitcoin derived from a \u00a35bn fraud in China committed by her employer, a fugitive from the Beijing authorities, a court heard on Monday.\n\nJian Wen, 42, has been charged with three counts of money laundering on behalf of a Chinese woman called Yadi Zhang, Southwark Crown Court in London heard.\n\nZhang had stolen approximately \u00a35bn from more than 128,000 investors in China between 2014 and 2017 through a wealth management fraud before converting the money into bitcoin and arriving in London in 2017 under a false identity, prosecutors told the court.\n\nWen is accused of helping to convert some of the bitcoin into cash, jewellery and other luxury items, as well as property, \u201call to disguise the true source of the funds\u201d, said Gillian Jones KC, acting on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nJones told the jury at the opening of the trial that Wen was not involved in Zhang\u2019s fraud, but did not dispute dealing with bitcoin on behalf of Zhang. Jones asked the jury to consider whether Wen knew or at least suspected that the bitcoin she was dealing with were the proceeds of crime.\n\nWen, who moved to the UK in 2007 and became a British citizen in 2018, was \u201cthe front person\u201d who would \u201ckeep Ms. Zhang in the background\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat was what Ms. Wen was paid to do,\u201d Jones added.\n\nBefore meeting Zhang, Wen worked in Chinese takeaway restaurants and lived in a \u201crelatively modest accommodation\u201d. But in 2017 she began living in a rented six-bed manor house in north London with Zhang.\n\nZhang, whose real name is Zhimin Qian, has fled the UK and remains at large, Jones said.\n\nWen has pleaded not guilty to the charges. She called herself Zhang\u2019s \u201ccarer\u201d, and said she believed Zhang was a wealthy businesswoman who had made her fortune from a jewellery business and property portfolio, as well as from the legitimate mining of bitcoin, Jones told the jury.\n\nThe trial is expected to last until early March."
