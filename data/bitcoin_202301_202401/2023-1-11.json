        "title": "Bitcoin mining was booming in Kazakhstan. Then it was gone. - MIT Technology Review",
        "content": "Beijing has long been suspicious of crypto, which it sees as allowing citizens to dodge their capital controls and move their money around and offshore using largely untraceable digital tokens. The position was an uncomfortable one in light of the country\u2019s place as the most significant producer of specialized equipment for bitcoin mining and the host of many mining operations.\n\nIn May 2021, the Chinese government announced a crackdown on mining, saying that the amount of energy the industry used was incompatible with the country\u2019s carbon emissions targets. Miners fled to more amenable jurisdictions. Some shipped their gear to the US, particularly to energy-rich, regulation-light states like Texas, but many crossed the border into Kazakhstan, bringing container loads of equipment by road and air. Kazakhstan was suddenly number two in the world for bitcoin mining, making up nearly 20% of the total hash rate, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, a research center in the UK.\n\nThe surge of new users stretched the electricity grid to capacity and beyond. Between January and October 2021, power use grew 8%\u2014four times the typical annual rate of increase. Kazakhstan, which had long been a net exporter of energy, found itself in deficit. There were power cuts in several areas of the country, and the national utility had to buy electricity at inflated prices from Russia.\n\nPower cuts weren\u2019t the main cause of the political turmoil that followed, but they were representative of the many cumulative failures that undermined trust in the government, and ultimately brought people to the streets in January 2022. What started with a demonstration about rising fuel prices snowballed into broader protests about falling standards of living, elite corruption, and the fact that Nazarbayev and his cronies were still believed to be pulling strings in Kazakhstani politics. The government sent riot police, and then Russian soldiers, to put down protests in Almaty. At least 225 people were killed. At the height of the protests the internet was shut down for three days. The impact of the shutdowns on the bitcoin price figured prominently in international headlines. Few observers, if any, reflected on the role that bitcoin mining had played in starting these events.\n\nFormer Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev remained close to the center of the country\u2019s politics, until mass protests in 2022. VASILY KRESTYANINOV/AP PHOTO\n\nUnder pressure to do something to curb the social unrest, the government, led by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, had to be seen to be dismantling the rump of the old regime, and tackling cronyism and corruption. Tokayev promised to build a \u201cnew Kazakhstan,\u201d and people and businesses that previously felt protected by their connections to the old guard were suddenly in the crosshairs of regulators.\n\nShuraev took advantage of the changing political climate, and in March 2022 he released a video on Instagram and YouTube detailing his investigations into Nigmatulin. Nigmatulin would later appear on a list released by Kazakhstan\u2019s Financial Monitoring Agency of more than 50 gray miners who had \u201cvoluntarily\u201d closed down their operations after investigations by the FMA. The grid failures and power shortages created by the industry had become \u201ca threat to the economic security of the country,\u201d the agency said. Nigmatulin did not reply to requests for comment."

El Salvador plans to use the Volcano Bond to pay down its sovereign debt, fund the construction of the Bitcoin City, and create Bitcoin mining infrastructure, according to Bitfinex, the technology provider for the bonds.\n\nUnder the government\u2019s proposal, the bonds would be denominated in U.S. dollars and pay 6.5% annually for ten years with a five-year lock-up period, with fast-track access for citizenship in the country. The announcement added that issuance of the bonds would soon begin.\n\nPresident Bukele Doubles Down on Bitcoin\n\nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele announced in September 2021 that he would make Bitcoin legal tender in the country, which has a population of only 6.3 million. Since then, he has doubled down on Bitcoin, despite the opposition of many of his own citizens.\n\nEven during the crypto winter of 2022, Bukele committed to buying one Bitcoin per day, which will be added to the country's stash of around 2,300 BTC. The country is now likely to move forward quickly with its bond issuance to fund $667 million on maturing bonds after an IMF loan was rejected.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe latest move comes at a time when El Salvador is facing financial trouble and debt default.In 2022, its credit ratings worsened to the \"most distressed sovereign debt in the world.\"The Central American country has taken a bold step at a time when the whole crypto industry is in turmoil.\n\n"

Bitcoin last traded at $19,013.30, according to CoinMetrics.\n\nU.S. inflation data out Thursday showed a modest retreat. The consumer price index decreased 0.1% in December on a monthly basis, in line with Dow Jones estimates.\n\nPrices still increased 6.5% year-over-year, however. This was down from a 7.1% jump in November and well off a 9.1% peak rate in June. Investors hope the decline may put pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to reverse interest rate increases.\n\nThe Fed and other central banks have been raising interest rates over the past year or so in an effort to tame soaring inflation, in moves that forced stocks and cryptocurrencies sharply lower in 2022.\n\nThe hope now is that the U.S. central bank will cut rates, taking some pressure off risk assets."

        "content": "Robinhood will no longer support the bitcoin fork favored by Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who has claimed to be pseudonymous Bitcoin developer Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe move has sent Bitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision (BSV) crashing against BTC, the asset favored by the faction known as Bitcoin Core \u2014 but more often as, simply, bitcoin.\n\nIn an update to users on Wednesday, the trading app said it would end support for BSV on Jan. 25 as part of a routine review of its crypto products.\n\nWith some geographical restrictions, users can continue to trade the token until the deadline.\n\nAfter entirely delisting the token, Robinhood will sell any remaining BSV for market value, and the proceeds will be credited to user accounts under available funds.\n\nBSV rallied alongside BTC against the US dollar Thursday but is down against BTC to levels not seen since the FTX bankruptcy.\n\nBSV/BTC | Source: TradingView\n\nThe latest development isn\u2019t likely to settle any debates about the legitimacy of the crypto in the pantheon of bitcoin forks, but it does remove one of the few remaining venues where BSV can be traded against actual dollars, as opposed to Tether\u2019s USDT. Of the latter, only OKX has significant volume \u2014 $17.5 million in 24-hour volume, per Coingecko.\n\nRobinhood didn\u2019t provide a specific reason for delisting the token, but the trading app has a \u201crigorous framework\u201d in place to regularly vet tokens on its platform.\n\nBitcoin SV was first included under Robinhood\u2019s brokerage in November 2018 after it emerged from the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nProponents of Bitcoin SV believe that it aims to execute some of the features mentioned in Nakamoto\u2019s white paper that appear to be absent in the original Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLike its predecessors, Bitcoin SV uses a proof-of-work protocol to verify transactions and sports the same maximum supply of 21 million tokens.\n\nIt emerged from political clashes within the Bitcoin Cash community, a little over a year after BCH forked Bitcoin, ostensibly to improve upon the scalability of the protocol and reduce transaction fees which, at the time, were quite high.\n\nAside from Wright, Bitcoin SV is championed by Canadian entrepreneur Calvin Ayre, who has described it as the most valuable network in the blockchain space. Ayre reacted to Robinhood\u2019s delisting of BSV as \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n\nWright meanwhile described the trading app as \u201cdishonest,\u201d saying \u201cthe last thing [Robinhood wants] is a system that stops their frauds.\u201d\n\nWright and the future of his \u201ccreation\u201d\n\nSpeaking of allegations of fraud, Wright lost a Norwegian libel suit in October that he launched against someone who called him just that for his unproven claims to be Satoshi.\n\nA subsequent defamation suit against podcaster Peter McCormack ended in December and also went against Wright, who was ordered to pay McCormack\u2019s legal fees.\n\nAnd in a blow to Wright\u2019s Satoshi narrative, Justice Chamberlain \u2014 the judge that oversaw Wright\u2019s case against McCormack \u2014 emphasized that it is \u201cimportant to be clear that Dr. Wright has not established that he is Satoshi\u201d \u2014 a detail not previously driven home at Wright\u2019s other trials.\n\nJustice Chamberlain also wrote that \u201cDr Wright had advanced a deliberately false case until shortly before trial,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen the falsity was exposed, he changed his case, explaining that he had made inadvertent errors. I rejected that explanation as untrue.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the ruling, Wright seemed to imply that he would back off on the idea of making his case to be Satoshi in court, instead appealing to the court of public opinion in a Twitter thread that begins, \u201cOne day, people will understand,\u201d and continues, \u201cI no longer care what you think. I care for my wife, my mother, and my family. I seek to see my creation used.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, his lawyers are still busy in the UK suing Bitcoin developers to try to force them to help Wright gain access to Satoshi\u2019s dormant bitcoins, which Wright claims were rendered inaccessible due to a case of lost private keys. That case is awaiting a ruling on jurisdiction before possibly proceeding to try the merits of the legal claim on the facts.\n\nThrough all this, Bitcoin SV is still ranked the 52nd cryptocurrency based on its market capitalization of around $804 million as of Thursday at 2:30 pm ET, according to data compiled by Blockworks. The token lost as much as 15% on Wednesday before rebounding strongly today along with the rest of the crypto market following the CPI data release by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "You Can Buy Bitcoin at a Discount, but There's a Catch - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's been a rough year and change since Bitcoin (BTC 2.49%) peaked in 2021. The leading cryptocurrency has plummeted 59% over the past year, and seen a portfolio-crushing 73% descent since hitting an all-time high just 14 months ago. The implosion of several high-profile digital currency exchanges and platforms has rattled the confidence of traders, but there could be an opportunity in the chaos.\n\nWhat if I told you that you could buy a position in Bitcoin at a 38% discount? And -- no -- this isn't a cruel joke where the trick is just to wait a few months for the denomination itself to get cheaper. The crypto market has shown some signs of stabilizing here. Bitcoin is actually trading slightly higher over the past week as well as the past month.\n\nI'm talking about an opportunity where you can buy $15.94 worth of Bitcoin for less than $10, but -- and there's always a \"but\" -- there's a catch that may very well scare you away.\n\nIt's a matter of trust\n\nA handful of exchange-traded funds hit the market in the past 15 months, but they're far from perfect. They don't own Bitcoin itself, relying instead on futures contracts for the digital currency to participate in the ups and downs of the crypto market. However, Grayscale Investments -- a player in the crypto market since its infancy a decade ago -- runs a few publicly traded trusts that have direct ownership of the underlying crypto.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -1.01%) is its largest offering, currently holding more than $11 billion in Bitcoin. Unlike the newer cryptocurrency ETFs, Grayscale's entry is established as an investment trust. It actually owns the crypto. After seeing FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and other exchanges collapse after taking big risks to provide some bonus yields, it's comforting to know that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust stores its assets offline, in cold storage.\n\nAs mentioned, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is trading at a 38% discount to its net asset value. The publicly traded trust closed at $9.88 on Tuesday, a 38% markdown on the $15.94 a share it owns in cold-stored Bitcoin assets. As they always say, if it seems to be too good to be true, you're probably right.\n\nFor starters, there's a price to pay for Grayscale buying, storing, and safekeeping Bitcoin directly. Its management fee is 2% annually, taken out in small bits over the course of the year, like most ETFs and mutual funds. Many of the futures-based ETFs that don't trade at significant discounts to their assets have lower sponsor fees. Adding insult to injury, this fee is charged on what is currently the $11 billion in assets under management, not the discounted market value of the shares.\n\nThe biggest catch: You can't cash out at the value of the trust's Bitcoin. You get in or out at the prevailing discounted rate. And -- spoiler alert -- it's a discount that has historically widened instead of contracted.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust consistently traded at a premium three years ago, when it was one of the few publicly traded ways to cash in on the Bitcoin boom. By late 2021, when Bitcoin was approaching $65,000, the trust was trading at a discount in the teens. It's far deeper now.\n\nA silver lining here is that the discount can also contract, which we've seen in recent weeks with the price of Bitcoin starting to stabilize. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is up 23% over the past month, with Bitcoin itself only rising 2% in that time. This isn't the norm, of course. As pointed out, even with Bitcoin hitting all-time highs in 2021 the double-digit discount was widening at the time.\n\nThere is no free lunch. However, if you feel that Bitcoin will bounce back -- and you understand the risks that come with freely trading trusts that will fetch varying premiums and discounts to the underlying assets -- this is one path to consider. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust offers crypto investments at a theoretical discount but at a stiff annual sponsor fee."

        "content": "Failed crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried invested $1 billion into Genesis Digital Assets, a bitcoin miner in Kazakhstan, just months before the collapse of his FTX platform heralded a crypto winter that's looking more like an ice age.\n\n\n\nBankman-Fried made the investment, the crypto exchange's biggest, through Alameda Research, the FTX-linked hedge fund that's at the center of his firm's bankruptcy, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nKey Takeaways Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Alameda Research invested about $1 billion in Kazakh bitcoin miner Genesis Digital Assets, bankruptcy disclosure has shown.\n\nBankman-Fried joined the board of the mining firm in October 2021, but resigned in November 2022, a day before FTX filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe sizable investment, one of FTX's largest assets, is yet another insight into the FTX collapse, which has irked the crypto community as about 1 million FTX creditors await repayment.\n\nBankman-Fried has defended his dealings as the head of FTX on social media, saying he \"didn't steal funds.\"\n\n$1 Billion On Mining Firm\n\nAlameda invested $1 billion between August 2021 and April 2022 four times: $100 million in August 2021, $550 million in January, $250 million in February, and $250 million in April 2022.\n\nAlameda shelled out half its investment on operations, spending the rest to buy shares held by two Genesis co-founders. Bankman-Fried joined the Genesis board in October 2021 and resigned on November 10, 2022\u2014one day before FTX filed for bankruptcy.\n\nGenesis didn't live up to its name. Bitcoin mining profits slid thanks to falling bitcoin prices, climbing electricity prices, and a high network hash rate. U.S. financier and short-lived Trump spokesman Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge Capital invested more than $60 million in Genesis and cut its stake by 59% between its June high point and September 2022, according to SkyBridge securities filings.\n\nIt didn't help that the Kazakhstan government restricted bitcoin mining, which led the company to move away from the country\u2014 and to the U.S.\n\n\n\nSBF Defends Himself on Substack\n\nBankman-Fried, who is out on bail at his parents' home in California and awaiting trial on federal fraud charges, defended himself on social media this week. He wrote on the email newsletter platform Substack that he's innocent and gave his explanation of what caused FTX's collapse.\n\nFTX and Alameda imploded due to a crypto market meltdown and inadequate hedging on Alameda's part, according to Bankman-Fried.\n\n\"I didn't steal funds, and I certainly didn't stash billions away,\" Bankman-Fried wrote on Substack. \"Alameda lost money due to a market crash it was not adequately hedged for\u2013as Three Arrows and others have this year. And FTX was impacted, as Voyager and others were earlier,'' he concluded.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMeanwhile, FTX's former director of engineering, Nishad Singh, engaged in a proffer session\u2014a meeting between a criminal defendant or suspect and the government outside a court\u2014which will offer him limited immunity. Singh hasn't been accused of wrongdoing. Earlier, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\n"

        "title": "From Bernie Madoff to Bankman-Fried, Bitcoin maximalists have been validated - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Long before Bitcoin (BTC), Bernie Madoff sat atop the longest-running, largest fraud in history. The rise and real-time fall of Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried, former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, were expedited in comparison. While the similarities are profound, the storyline is not: Create organizations under false pretenses, develop relationships with people in authority positions, defraud clients, survive as long as possible, and try not to get caught.\n\nMadoff advisers experienced a \u201cliquidity\u201d problem in 2008, around late November into early December, where the fund was unable to meet client redemption requests. On its surface, the fourth-quarter timing of the Madoff collapse more than a decade ago appears eerily similar to FTX\u2019s 2022 implosion. Bitcoiners who hold their keys will never experience a \u201cliquidity problem,\u201d as their Bitcoin isn\u2019t being used to leverage anything else. It is the hardest money around as long as it stays in the custody of its rightful owner.\n\nEven near the collapse, Madoff had planned to pay out $173 million in early bonuses to family and friends. When questioned by his sons on Dec. 9, 2008, Madoff confessed to the massive fraud. The numbers, in many instances, are fractions of the fraud FTX is accused of. Bitcoin maximalists continue to remind their communities that yield, third-party custodians and humans cannot be trusted. Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s white paper endures.\n\nMadoff\u2019s sons communicated, almost immediately, with an attorney, who advised them to contact federal authorities. Madoff was arrested on Dec. 11, one day after federal agencies were made aware of the fraud.\n\nRelated: The outcome of SBF\u2019s prosecution could determine how the IRS treats your FTX losses\n\nOn Nov. 8, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced on Twitter that he tentatively intended to purchase FTX, but he quickly reversed the decision, and a \u201cliquidity\u201d problem ensued at FTX. Bitcoin maximalists either watched idly, shaking their heads in disbelief \u2014 knowing it was a matter of time \u2014 or simply went on with their lives. Many maximalists might very well have been a part of Mt. Gox, which held approximately 80% of all BTC in circulation at the time it was breached. The \u201cwake-up call\u201d is an unfortunate initiation ritual for some Bitcoiners. FTX will mint many new Bitcoin maximalists.\n\nIn December, SBF was arrested in the Bahamas. As authors and researchers, we\u2019re confident that correlations will be immediately identified and explored in regard to the timing of Madoff\u2019s arrest on Dec. 11, 2008.\n\nAs SBF faces extradition to the United States, based upon the \u201cTreaty Between the United States and the Bahamas,\u201d he faces sentence terms that may mirror Madoff\u2019s, who faced a 150-year prison sentence for an arsenal of convictions. Those convictions included:\n\n40 years for two counts of international money laundering\n\n20 years for one count of securities fraud\n\n20 years for one count of mail fraud\n\n20 years for one count of wire fraud\n\n20 years for one count of false filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n\n10 years for one count of money laundering\n\nFive years for one count of investment adviser fraud\n\nFive years for one count of false statements\n\nFive years for one count of perjury\n\nFive years for one count of theft from an employee benefit plan\n\nTo provide some perspective, the longest sentences for recent financial fraud include, in order:\n\nShalom Weiss (845 years)\n\nNorman Schmidt (330 years)\n\nBernie Madoff (150 years)\n\nFrederick Brandau (55 years)\n\nA tie for fifth place between Charles Lewis, Eduardo Masferrer, Chalana McFarland and Lance Poulsen, who received 30-year sentences.\n\nBased on the limited release documents at the time of publication, SBF may have his name included on the top five listed above \u2014 even potentially at or near the top. That would be fair considering that, among other allegations, his political donations may have impacted or influenced U.S. political elections.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s time for crypto fans to stop supporting cults of personality\n\nMadoff\u2019s prisoner number was 61727-054. Note that these oddly hyphenated eight digits weren\u2019t representative of an account number, an SEC filing record or some secretive financial code; the numbers were Madoff\u2019s former inmate number at Federal Correctional Complex, Butner.\n\nIf and/or when the time comes, SBF may be remembered by a similar numeric value instead of a cheeky three-letter moniker (\u201cSBF\u201d). Time will tell. Remember, Madoff pleaded guilty and still received 150 years, eventually dying while in custody.\n\nBitcoin > bribes\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Not your keys, not your coins.\n\nStop giving your hard-earned money and Bitcoin to \u201ctrusted\u201d third parties. Whether or not SBF spends a day in prison, or multiple lifetimes, the future of SBF means nothing to Bitcoin maximalists. In truth, if SBF walks free, the event will only confirm a greater Ponzi scheme that Bitcoiners are well aware of.\n\nBitcoin maximalists continue to preach, and events such as the collapse of FTX (among numerous other exchanges) are dire reminders of Nakamoto\u2019s words that kicked off the introduction of Bitcoin\u2019s white paper: \u201cCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties. [\u2026] While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.\u201d\n\nThere were and continue to be many lessons to be learned when examining the greed, lack of empathy and overall corruption humans have witnessed throughout history; and as events of this magnitude unfold, at the heart of every failure is trust \u2014 or a lack thereof.\n\nBitcoin's market capitalization from 2013-2023. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nBitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work model \u2014 including but not limited to how transactions occur, timestamps are recorded, hash rates adjust, the network broadcasts nodes, incentives are rewarded, verification occurs and privacy is encoded \u2014 is the solution many Bitcoiners have come to take comfort in. The trust lies in the protocol rather than in individuals. Time and time again, a broken world and unscrupulous actors make the case for a trustless system.\n\nRelated: From the NY Times to WaPo, the media is fawning over Bankman-Fried\n\nNo matter how well-regulated, designed or engineered future financial systems, exchanges or \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d claim to be, they all have the same failure point: human nature and greed.\n\nBitcoiners realize this, and as many more become aware of financial fraud \u2014 whether impacted directly or indirectly \u2014 Bitcoin continues to emerge as the most obvious solution. SBF may teach a new generation of \u201cinvestors\u201d the same hard lesson learned by their parents: When something is too good to be true, it often is.\n\nThe failure of FTX is not a surprise, nor are the potential connections between SBF and high-ranking officials. The fact that punishments may not fit the crime(s) shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, either. In truth, maximalists realize that Bitcoin will be around long after the SBF dust has settled. Bring on the next Ponzi scheme \u2014 Bitcoin maximalists appear immune.\n\nKenneth Minesinger is a professor of law at California Baptist University.

Speaking to a U.S. bankruptcy judge in Delaware on Jan. 11, Dietderich stated that the company plans to sell $4.6 billion of non-strategic investments.\n\nLet\u2019s look at derivatives metrics to understand whether professional traders are excited about Bitcoin\u2019s rally to $19,000.\n\nMargin use increased as Bitcoin price rallied to $18,300 and above\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned, and margin is beneficial to some investors because it allows them to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nFor instance, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only short the cryptocurrency as they bet on its price declining. Unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn\u2019t always matched.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio firmly increased on Jan. 11, signaling that professional traders added leverage longs as Bitcoin rallied toward $18,300.\n\nMore importantly, the subsequent 2% correction on Jan. 12 that led Bitcoin to a $17,920 low marked the complete margin reversal, meaning whales and market makers reduced their bullish positions using margin markets.\n\nPresently at 21, the metric favors stablecoin borrowing by a wide margin, indicating that bears are not confident about opening Bitcoin margin shorts.\n\nFutures traders ignored the Bitcoin price pump\n\nThe long-to-short metric excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets. In addition, it gathers data from exchange clients\u2019 positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how professional traders are positioned.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges' top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nEven though Bitcoin broke above the $18,000 resistance, professional traders have kept their leverage long positions unchanged, according to the long-to-short indicator.\n\nFor instance, the ratio for Binance traders stood firm at 1.08 from Jan. 9 until Jan. 12. Meanwhile, top traders at Huobi reduced their leverage longs as the indicator moved from 1.09 to the present 0.91. Lastly, at crypto exchange OKX, the long-to-short slightly increased favoring longs, moving from 0.95 on Jan. 9 to the current 0.97.\n\nTraders using futures contracts were not confident enough to add leveraged bullish positions despite the price increase.\n\nRelated: 13% of BTC supply returns to profit as Bitcoin sees 'massive' accumulation\n\nBitcoin price could retest $17,300\n\nWhile the margin data shows that sizable leverage was used to push Bitcoin above $18,000, it suggests that the situation was only temporary. Most likely, those professional traders deposited more margin and consequently reduced their leverage after the event. In essence, the metric looks very healthy because it indicates that margin markets are not overbought.\n\nAs for the top trader\u2019s long-to-short, the absence of demand for leverage longs using futures contracts is somewhat concerning, but at the same time, it leaves room for additional purchasing power.\n\nFrom a derivatives standpoint, even if Bitcoin retests $17,300, the bulls should not be concerned because the derivatives indicators show little demand from short sellers and no excessive leverage from buyers.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Northern Data AG, a German company that specializes in Bitcoin mining and cloud computing, has released earnings results for its mining division.\n\nNorthern Data AG said that in fiscal 2022, it mined 2,798 Bitcoin (BTC), up 315% from the previous year. This led to BTC mining revenues of 77.7 million euros in fiscal 2022. The company sold 3,005 BTC sold in 2022 for an average price of 23,849 euros, contributing to a cash revenue of 71.7 million euros.\n\nThe data released by Northern Data also indicated that it had approximately 3.6 exahash a second (EH/s) of computing power dedicated to BTC mining. Additionally, the company said it expects unaudited consolidated revenues in the range of 190 million to 194 million euros, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) \u201cadjusted for the trading loss from the sale of cryptocurrencies\u201d of 40 million to 50 million euros.\n\nHowever, December was a challenging month for Northern Data. The company mined a total of 177 Bitcoin, down 15% from November and down 25% from December 2021. This was due to high energy prices, particularly in Europe, which caused the deployed ASIC machines in Europe to have set amounts of \u201cdowntime\u201d where they were unable toproduce continuously.\n\nThe firm said it is relocating its ASIC machines to \u201cenergy price optimized locations\u201d to ensure production stability and optimal capacity utilization in an attempt to reach its production target of 350 BTC per month.\n\nRelated: Public Bitcoin mining companies plagued with $4B of collective debt\n\nOn Jan. 6, Cointelegraph reported that one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations in North America, Marathon Digital Holdings, has been experimenting with overclocking to increase its competitive advantage in the BTC mining industry.\n\nAccording to an update issued by Marathon Digital Holdings, it produced 475 BTC in December, bringing its total mined Bitcoin in the fiscal 2022 to 4,144 BTC, a 30% increase from the 3,197 BTC produced in fiscal 2021.\n\nRecently, some Bitcoin mining companies have faced challenges due to the increasing difficulty of mining and the price of electricity. This has caused a decline in mining profitability and led some miners to shut down their operations. Others have reported significant revenue growth and increases in mining power, thanks to better mining hardware and mining software optimization."

This artificially inflated demand can mislead other traders into investing real money into the asset.\n\nSince higher demand typically leads to higher prices, traders can use this process as a type of \"pump-and-dump\" scheme: When the price is as high as the trader thinks it can go, they can cash out and leave other investors with the asset that's declining in value.\n\nAlthough wash trading has been illegal within traditional U.S. financial markets for decades, it's likely difficult to crack down on the activity within the crypto space."

Recent news events have made many feel uneasy about entering the crypto markets, but stronger legislation on how crypto institutions are allowed to operate could help restore confidence.\n\nWhile 2022 saw plenty of discussion around potential frameworks, including an executive order from the White House, little has been set in stone.\n\nJason Ward, Head of the Blockchain Incubator for the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology (FCAT) is also watching for regulatory clarity in 2 additional areas. The first is whether crypto assets will be classified as securities or non-securities, or if different crypto assets will fall into different categories. This can have significant implications for how strictly crypto is regulated going forward.\n\nThe second is whether regulators might establish a minimum tax threshold for crypto transactions (hypothetical example: Any purchase paid for with crypto under $100 would be exempt from capital gains or losses). While cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are designed to be exchanged for goods and services, transactions are currently taxable events, which makes it inconvenient for many users.\n\n\"Tax treatment around small transactions is holding back [crypto holders] in general,\" says Ward. \"More clarity around [tax treatment] could clear the way for greater utilization.\""

The price move gave bulls control of the $275 million BTC weekly options expiry on Jan. 13, as bears had placed bets at $16,500 and lower.\n\nThe recent move has permabulls and dip-buyers calling a market bottom and potential end to the bear market, but what does the data actually show?\n\nIs the Bitcoin bear market over?\n\nIt might seem too pessimistic to say right now, but Bitcoin did trade below the $16,500 level on Dec. 30, and those bearish bets are unlikely to pay off as the options deadline approaches.\n\nInvestors\u2019 main hope is the possibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve halting its interest rate increase in the first quarter of 2023. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report will be released on Jan. 12, and it might give a hint on whether the central bank\u2019s effort to slow the economy and bring down inflation is achieving its expected results.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto traders fear that an eventual downturn in the traditional markets could cause Bitcoin to retest the $15,500 low. For instance, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief investment officer and chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, told investors on CNBC to brace for a winter downdraft and warned that the S&P 500 index is vulnerable to a 23% drop to 3,000. Wilson added, \u201cEven though a majority of institutional clients think we\u2019re probably going to be in a recession, they don\u2019t seem to be afraid of it. That\u2019s just a big disconnect.\u201d\n\nBitcoin bears were not expecting the rally to $17,500\n\nThe open interest for the Jan. 13 options expiry is $275 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were expecting prices below $16,500. Bulls seem in complete control, even though their payout becomes much larger at $18,000 and higher.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Jan. 13. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 1.18 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $150 million call (buy) open interest and the $125 million put (sell) options. If Bitcoin\u2019s price remains above $17,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Jan. 13, less than $2 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $16,500 or $15,500 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\n$18,000 Bitcoin will give bulls a $130 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Jan. 13 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $16,000 and $16,500: 100 calls vs. 2,700 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $40 million.\n\nBetween $16,500 and $17,500: 1,400 calls vs. 1,500 puts. The net result is balanced between bears and bulls.\n\nBetween $17,500 and $18,000: 4,500 calls vs. 100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $75 million.\n\nBetween $18,000 and $19,000: 7,200 calls vs. 0 puts. Bulls completely dominate the expiry by profiting $130 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the put options used in bearish bets and the call options exclusively in neutral-to-bullish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. But unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin gained 300% in year before last halving \u2014 Is 2023 different?\n\nBitcoin bears need to push the price below $16,500 on Jan. 13 to secure a potential $40 million profit. On the other hand, the bulls can boost their gains by slightly pushing the price above $17,500 to profit by $75 million.\n\nThe four-day rally totaled a 4.5% gain and liquidated $285 million worth of leverage short (sell) futures contracts, so they might have less margin required to subdue Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nConsidering the uncertainty from the upcoming CPI inflation data, all bets are on the table, but bulls have decent incentives to try pushing Bitcoin price above $17,500 on Jan. 13.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Stock trading app Robinhood warned Wednesday it would soon end support for Bitcoin SV (BSV), with plans to delist the coin later this month.\n\nRobinhood users will no longer be able to buy, sell, or transfer Bitcoin SV after Jan. 25, according to a company update. Any remaining BSV in customer accounts after that will be automatically sold with users credited accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe have a rigorous framework in place to help us regularly review the crypto we offer on Robinhood,\u201d the company stated. \u201cWhile we do not discuss the process for assets on an individual basis, based on our latest review, we\u2019ve decided to end support for Bitcoin SV.\u201d\n\nBSV is the only coin Robinhood said will be impacted by the delisting. The platform currently offers trading on 19 different tokens through its Robinhood Crypto service, including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe price of BSV fell sharply on Wednesday. Its price had decreased 11% to $39.11 over the past day as of this writing, according to data from CoinGecko. The figure represented a 92% decline in price from an all-time high of $489.75 set in April of 2021.\n\nBitcoin SV was first added to Robinhood\u2019s platform in November of 2018 after a hard fork involving Bitcoin Cash created the token. Bitcoin Cash itself is the result of a hard fork with Bitcoin\u2019s protocol.\n\nBitcoin Cash is now tradable again. We\u2019ve removed the halt following the hard fork. The fork produced a new asset, Bitcoin SV. BSV will be automatically distributed to BCH holders, who are entitled to one BSV per unit of BCH owned on the day of the fork (11/15). \u2014 Robinhood Help (@AskRobinhood) November 30, 2018\n\nA hard fork essentially creates two cryptocurrencies out of one, when changes made to a token through software updates make it incompatible with previous versions, resulting in two distinct branches.\n\nBitcoin SV, or \u201cSatoshi\u2019s Vision,\u201d is distinct from other versions of Bitcoin, including Bitcoin Cash, because of its larger block size, which results in reduced transaction fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nBSV is currently ranked 54 among all cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, with a total value of $745 million. It is significantly smaller than Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash with market capitalizations of $335 billion and $2 billion, respectively.\n\nThe token is only available on less than a handful of exchanges, such as OKX, KuCoin, and Huobi. Many exchanges have delisted the token from their platforms over time, including San Francisco-based OKCoin, which ended its support of BSV in February of 2021.\n\nBinance, Kraken delisting Bitcoin SV sets a bad precedent, say critics\n\nBSV has been championed by Craig Wright, who has made unproven claims about being the true Satoshi Nakamato\u2013Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator\u2013since 2016.\n\nIn a defamation case against podcaster Peter McCormack, who had repeatedly called Wright a \u201cfraud\u201d for claiming to be Satoshi, a British court ruled Wright submitted \u201cdeliberately false\u201d evidence in August of last year.\n\nIn December, Wright\u2019s campaign to convince the masses that he created Bitcoin appeared to be coming to a close.\n\n\u201cI have been too angry for too long as I cared for external validation,\u201d he said in a Tweet. \u201cThe only validation I seek now is from my family and from seeing my ideas come to fruition and to be used by the world."

Apart from the spot market, the equity exchange-traded fund (ETF) market is also dominated by BTC, wherein Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) is the leading equity ETF market and is up by 40% year to date.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining ETF is leading the traditional equity ETF market and the leveraged equity ETFs, which is considered a rare occurrence. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that the Valkyrie Bitcoin mining ETF is highly \u201cconcentrated,\u201d with investment in only 20 firms, including Argo Blockchain, Bitfarm and Intel, among other notable names.\n\nThe WGMI ETF was listed on the Nasdaq in February 2022 but didn\u2019t invest directly in BTC. 80% of its net assets offer exposure through the securities of companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue or profits from BTC mining. Valkyrie invests the rest of the 20% in companies holding \u201ca significant portion of their net assets\u201d in Bitcoin.\n\nEquity ETF market performance. Source: Bloomberg\n\nThe first Bitcoin ETF to be approved in the United States was ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in October 2021, which tracked Bitcoin prices through futures contracts traded on the CME marketplace. The first ETF gained a lot of early market traction, seeing $1 billion in trading volume on its first day. This made many believe that the success would eventually convince regulators to approve the first spot market-based ETF in 2022. However, a prolonged crypto winter and crypto contagions turned the tide against the crypto ETFs.\n\nCryptocurrency-related ETFs became the two worst-performing ETFs in Australia in 2022, with the same story playing out in the United States. According to ETF.com, the top four worst-performing ETFs in the U.S. in 2022 were crypto-related.\n\nRelated: Grayscale CEO highlights 20% GBTC share buyback option if ETF conversion fails\n\nCrypto ETFs were seen as the next big step for the crypto industry to drive mainstream adoption.

Lagos, the capital of Nigeria \u2014 Africa\u2019s most populous country \u2014 welcomed a new Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) node this week, a vital step to better connect the continent to the layer-2 payments network that sits atop Bitcoin.\n\nThe node runs on an old laptop powered by a diesel generator, as Lagos regularly experiences energy and electricity blackouts.\n\nMegasley\u2019s diesel generator and laptop running the node. Source: Megasley\n\nIn a discussion with Cointelegraph, Megasley, who operates the first Nigerian Lightning node of 2023 and the first active Lightning node in the country (other nodes are dormant), shared his vision for bringing instant, low-cost payments to Africa thanks to the LN.\n\n\u201dLight takes 50 milliseconds to cross the earth. This is quick, but with many hops, these milliseconds can add up. And when you\u2019re standing at a point of sale waiting for your payment to clear, it can be frustrating.\u201d\n\nMegasley explained his wish for Africans to have payments that are instant and as close to free as possible. \u201cIf a Nigerian Bitcoiner and a Nigerian retailer are both connected to a node in Nigeria, it will give them the best Lightning experience,\u201d Megasley added.\n\nNigeria Free Routing is live!\n\n\n\nThe lightning network is now alive and routing on the ground in Lagos .\n\n\n\nPlease share and support us by opening a channel to us: https://t.co/nClBZbW4zA pic.twitter.com/hGsKobyjzY \u2014 Africa Free Routing \u26a1 (@FreeRoutingAf) January 10, 2023\n\nAccording to the explorer services Mempool and Amboss, the operator is currently the only active node on the map in Nigeria. By spinning up the node, the operator aims to make Lightning payments as accessible as possible to Africans.\n\nWhen asked about the importance of building out an extensive network of nodes across the globe to facilitate Bitcoin payments, the node runner explained, \u201cIf Bitcoin is to succeed, it must become a better, easier, faster medium of exchange than the incumbents. To get there, we need to build out an extensive network of nodes across the globe to facilitate these payments.\u201d\n\nMegasley also touched on Bitcoin (BTC) price volatility and its perception in Africa: \u201cPeople talk about the problem of volatility, but this is nothing when you live in a place where your money could easily lose half its value in a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfrica has rotten money controlled by rotten people, and this is why we need Bitcoin. We will take the power of money away from them so that the enormous potential of the African people can thrive.\"\n\nIndeed, there has been a surge in Bitcoin adoption among the countries that use the Central African franc, bolstered by Bitcoin conferences and forums in Senegal and Ghana. Although Nigeria has shown promising signs of Bitcoin adoption, such as legal tender discussion, the legacy financial system has imposed further restrictions in 2023.\n\nFor example, Nigerians will only be allowed to withdraw $44 dollars per week per individual and a maximum of $11,000 for businesses in 2023, as per the government\u2019s efforts to phase out cash. As a reminder, Bitcoin has no limits or restrictions for its use. To transact freely on the Bitcoin network, users require only a phone and an internet connection.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin, Sango Coin and the Central African Republic\n\nThe establishment of a Bitcoin Lightning node in Nigeria is a significant step toward increasing accessibility and adoption of the cryptocurrency in the country and the continent as a whole. Ultimately, Megasley hopes to empower individuals and businesses in Africa to take control of their financial future."

That price represents a gain of 8.05% in one day, as the asset was priced close to $17,561 just 24 hours ago.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s sudden gains may be due to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) update that was released earlier today. That report matched estimates of 6.5% year-on-year inflation, and Bitcoin prices more or less remained stable at the time of the report.\n\nAnticipation of the CPI report also gave Bitcoin a foundation to build on earlier today. Prior to the release of the CPI data, Bitcoin\u2019s prices were near $18,250. Following a subsequent drop in value, Bitcoin quickly recovered and prices rose further.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s gains, some professional investors such as Peter Schiff recommended that Bitcoin holders sell in advance of the CPI data report. Schiff noted that Bitcoin was at a three-week high, implying that the asset would likely lose value following the report. He called this an \u201cexcellent opportunity for HOLDers to sell\u201d Bitcoin for gold.\n\nThough Schiff\u2019s prediction has not yet proven correct, it is of course possible that Bitcoin will lose value in the near future.\n\nBitcoin is, as always, the largest cryptocurrency by a wide margin. However, its sudden price gain has also helped it climb the ranks against stocks and other traditional assets. With a market capitalization of $365 billion, it briefly became the 20th largest asset, ranking above Mastercard (MA) and Facebook or Meta (META).\n\nThe asset\u2019s growth has also led to gains elsewhere in the crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) is up 6.7% over the past 24 hours, while the crypto market overall is up 5.5%."

        "title": "Bitcoin: U.S. Inflation, debt crisis, and more might threaten BTC\u2019s 2023 - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin is in the accumulation zone according to the BTC pricing model.\n\nDemand for BTC experiences a recovery as hopes for a recovery bloom.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] investors are going through renewed hope for a long-term recovery. As such, it is important to juxtapose those expectations with an economic outlook. Perhaps this might help gauge whether it is indeed logical to expect a major rally in 2023 and 2024.\n\nHow many Bitcoins can you get for $1?\n\nBefore getting into debt and inflation concerns, one must first look at why long-term bullish expectations are gaining traction. Bitcoin\u2019s pricing model revealed that Bitcoin has been trading below its realized price since September 2022. This is significant because as per BTC\u2019s past performance, a price dip under the realized price marked the end of the bearish cycle.\n\nIf the same expectation is true, then Bitcoin is currently at or near the bottom range. This is the same range where accumulation is bound to take place. This is further reinforced by the MVRV ratio, which is still below one, meaning it is still oversold.\n\nCan Bitcoin thrive amid economic recession concerns?\n\n2022\u2019s biggest lesson for the crypto market was that economic factors have a heavy hand in Bitcoin\u2019s performance. Will history repeat itself if the U.S cannot combat inflation? According to economic analyst Sean Foo, the government has been borrowing money to combat inflation.\n\nThe battle against inflation may bring about an extra debt burden and discourage lenders. Such an outcome might lead to higher inflation and a dive into economic recession. But what will be the impact on Bitcoin? It all depends on the state of the dollar.\n\nAs more countries threaten to abandon the dollar as the global reserve, a likely outcome would be a shift in favor of hard money. Gold is currently the preference, but perhaps gold might find favor with the masses in such a scenario.\n\nAre your BTC holdings flashing green? Check the Bitcoin profit calculator\n\nThe state of Bitcoin accumulation\n\nAn analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s supply in profit revealed that more traders were in profit since the start of January 2023. Roughly 11.2 million BTC is in profit, which means that this is an amount that is in private addresses already. Roughly 7.66 million BTC was at a loss at press time.\n\nThe amount in loss dropped substantially in the last 10 days, implying that a significant amount had been accumulated since the start of the month. This confirmed that many BTC investors were optimistic about the prospects of a rally in 2023. But nothing is cast in stone, and things may not necessarily turn out as expected, especially now that there is less liquidity in the market."

        "title": "Why the Winklevoss brothers are in a $900 million crypto faceoff with Barry Silbert - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article FTT.CM=\n\nBTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nTyler Winklevoss, chief executive officer and co-founder of Gemini Trust Co., left, and Cameron Winklevoss, president and co-founder of Gemini Trust Co., speak during the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Florida, U.S., on Friday, June 4, 2021. Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nCameron Winklevoss and Barry Silbert were both early believers in bitcoin who made a fortune on their investments and built big businesses along the way. For nearly two years, they enjoyed a mutually beneficial partnership that made their customers a lot of money. Now, the bitcoin heavyweights are in a bruising war of words that illustrates the depths of the crypto crisis and underscores the risks that were ultimately shouldered by ordinary investors who got caught up in a massively unregulated market. As it stands, hundreds of millions of dollars of customer cash sits in inaccessible limbo as the two crypto entrepreneurs battle over who is responsible. Silbert is the founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG), a crypto conglomerate that includes the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and trading platform Genesis. Winklevoss, along with his brother Tyler, co-founded Gemini, a popular crypto exchange that, unlike many of its peers, is subject to New York banking regulation. Winklevoss and Silbert were linked through an offering called Earn, a nearly two-year-old product from Gemini that promoted returns of up to 8% on customer deposits. With Earn, Gemini loaned client money to Genesis for placement across various crypto trading desks and borrowers. As the digital coin markets soared in 2020 and 2021, that capital produced high returns for Genesis and easily paid Earn users their yield, which was very attractive at a time when the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate was at virtually zero. Other riskier (and now defunct) crypto platforms like Celsius and Voyager Digital were offering yields as high as 20%.\n\nBarry Silbert, Founder and CEO, Digital Currency Group David A. Grogan | CNBC\n\nIt was a booming business. Genesis had 260 employees and a robust sales desk, and Gemini was one of its largest lending partners, sending $900 million worth of customer crypto to the firm. Gemini considered Genesis, which is regulated by New York state and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to be the most reliable name in crypto lending, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Diversification was a challenge, because other players had looser risk standards, said the source, who asked not to be named for confidentiality.\n\nFriends turned foes\n\nIn 2022, the crypto market cratered, and the Earn model fell apart. Cryptocurrencies turned south, borrowers stopped repaying their debts, hedge funds and lenders went under, and activity screeched to a halt. The floodgates opened even wider in November, when FTX spiraled into bankruptcy and customers of the crypto exchange were unable to access billions of dollars in deposits. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was soon arrested on fraud charges, accused of using client funds for trading, lending, venture investments and his lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas. An industrywide crunch ensued as crypto investors across the board tried to withdraw their assets. Five days after FTX collapsed, Genesis was forced to freeze new lending and suspend redemptions. In a tweet the company said \"FTX has created unprecedented market turmoil, resulting in abnormal withdrawal requests which have exceeded our current liquidity.\" The contagion was so rapid that both Gemini and Genesis hired experts to guide them through a potential Genesis bankruptcy. All withdrawals on Earn have been paused since November. Gemini's 340,000 retail clients are angry, and some have come together in class actions against Genesis and Gemini. Winklevoss places the blame on Silbert's shoulders, and he's gone public with his battle to retrieve the $900 million of deposits his clients placed with Genesis. In a letter to Silbert on Jan. 2, Winklevoss said those funds belong to customers including a school teacher, a police officer and \"a single mom who lent her son's education money to you.\" Winklevoss said Gemini had been trying for six weeks to engage in a \"good faith\" manner with Silbert only to be met with \"bad faith stall tactics.\" Gemini attorneys had attempted to work with Genesis' team through the Thanksgiving holiday, but found their efforts effectively rebuffed, a source said. Another person who asked not to be named told CNBC that advisors for Genesis, DCG, and Gemini's creditor committee had met multiple times throughout the six-week period that Winklevoss referenced. Gemini creditors are represented by lawyers from both Kirkland & Ellis and Proskauer Rose, and financial advisors at Houlihan Lokey. Advisors for DCG and Genesis include the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and investment bank Moelis and Company. The most recent meeting between the three sets of lawyers and bankers was Monday, according to that individual. On Tuesday, Winklevoss followed up with an open letter to DCG's board, asking that it replace Silbert. One of Winklevoss' central complaints stems from a loan that Silbert made to Genesis after the demise of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) last year. Genesis was owed over $1 billion by 3AC when the firm defaulted on its debt. Silbert stepped in and effectively backstopped his trading firm's exposure with a $1.1 billion intercompany loan to Genesis. At the time, Genesis sought to reassure Gemini that the DCG unit remained solvent and strong and was supported by its parent company. Silbert justified the decision in a message to investors this week, writing that \"Genesis had unrivaled expertise and the best institutional client base in the world.\" Court filings show that on July 6, Genesis assured Gemini that liquidity was not a concern, and the two parties agreed to keep working together.\n\nwatch now\n\nGemini claims that Genesis provided misleading information regarding Silbert's loan. Rather than serving to bolster Genesis' operating position, the loan was a \"10-year promissory note\" and was a \"complete gimmick that did nothing to improve Genesis' immediate liquidity position or make its balance sheet solvent,\" Winklevoss wrote. Silbert has avoided responding directly to Winklevoss' latest accusation, though the company has taken up his defense. In a tweet on Tuesday, DCG called the letter \"another desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt,\" adding that, \"we are preserving all legal remedies in response to these malicious, fake, and defamatory attacks.\" \"DCG will continue to engage in productive dialogue with Genesis and its creditors with the goal of arriving at a solution that works for all parties,\" the company said. A DCG spokesperson told CNBC the company denies Winklevoss' allegations of financial impropriety. For the 41-year-old Winklevoss twins, a public and high-profile spat is nothing new. They're best known for their role in the birth of Facebook, now known as Meta , which was founded by Harvard classmate Mark Zuckerberg. They sued Zuckerberg, eventually settling in 2011 for a $65 million payout in cash and Facebook stock. The brothers quickly pivoted to crypto and by 2013 said they controlled 1% of all bitcoin in circulation. The stake soared from $11 million at that time to over $4.5 billion when bitcoin peaked in 2021. Silbert, 46, got into the market at around the same time. He sold his prior company, SecondMarket, to Nasdaq in 2015, and started DCG that year. But he first invested in bitcoin in 2012. Silbert and the Winklevoss brothers were bitcoin bulls long before any exchanges or trading apps had made it simple to buy digital currencies and well ahead of institutional interest in the space. Now that the trade has reversed, they're deep in the struggle. Facing increasing pressure from creditors and the looming threat of bankruptcy, Genesis recently cut headcount by 30% in a second round of layoffs. Gemini slashed 10% of its staff in June 2022, with another round of layoffs seven weeks later. Winklevoss says Gemini's thousands of customers are \"looking for answers.\" On Tuesday, Gemini told Earn clients that it's terminating customer loan agreements with Genesis and ending the program. Gemini and Genesis insist that they're negotiating in good faith. But the harsh reality is that, with the popping of the crypto bubble last year, both companies were left with no place to hide. Their clients are now scrambling to be made whole. \u2014 CNBC's Kate Rooney contributed to this report."

        "content": "Publicly-listed Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Argo Blockchain saw a significant drop in mining activity in December 2022 due to a winter storm in Texas.\n\nOn Jan. 11, Argo released its first operational update since selling its flagship mining facility Helios to Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital. The company said it mined 147 Bitcoin or BTC equivalents in December, compared to 198 BTC in November 2022.\n\nThe firm said that as of Dec. 31, Argo held 141 BTC, with its December mining revenue amounting to $2.49 million. Argo\u2019s total debt was approximately $79 million and its bank balance was about $20 million.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the decrease in the amount of mined BTC was mainly due to Argo curtailing mining operations at Helios in response to a major winter storm in Texas.\n\nIn late December, the United States Department of Energy declared a power emergency in Texas, citing a shortage of electricity due to the impact of severe winter weather. Amid a massive temperature drop accompanied by high winds, the demand on the Texas power grid reached an all-time winter peak in excess of 74,000 megawatts (MW).\n\nArgo CEO Peter Wall pointed out that the company\u2019s mining results were lower than expected because the firm had to reduce power usage on the grid due to extreme weather conditions.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners see mixed successes in tackling debt-fueled overexpansion crisis\n\nDuring the winter storm, Argo joined other Texas Bitcoin miners in reducing power usage by an estimated 1,500 MW, Wall said, adding:\n\n\u201cAfter the winter storm and associated freezing temperatures had subsided, we safely brought Helios back online and resumed operations.\u201d\n\nWall mentioned that Argo eventually decided to sell its Helios facility to Galaxy Digital, announcing the $65 million deal on Dec. 28. The transaction aimed to reduce Argo\u2019s total debt by $41 million and improve liquidity and operating structure.\n\nDespite the sale, Argo will still continue mining at the Galaxy-owned Helios facility. Argo\u2019s total hash rate capacity continues to be 2.5 exahashes-per-second, the announcement notes."

Bitcoin has advanced for nine straight days, the longest such streak since 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin has added more than 10% this month and second-largest token Ether about 17%.\n\nOverall, the global cryptocurrency market cap today remained below the $1 trillion mark, even as it was up over 4% in the last 24 hours to $926 billion, as per the data by CoinGecko.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain and the second largest cryptocurrency, also gained about 5% to $1,401. Meanwhile, dogecoin price today was also trading over 5% higher at $0.08 whereas Shiba Inu surged over 6% at $0.000009.\n\n\"Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $18,000 and experienced an upward movement in the past 24 hours. Despite initially facing resistance at that level, it eventually broke through. Overall, BTC started the year on a positive note. It was trading at around $16,500 on January 1st, but by the end of the first week, it had increased to nearly $17,000. BTC's existing market capitalization is above $335 billion. However, its dominance over other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) is around 39%, which is a 1% decrease since last week,\" said Edul Patel CEO & Co-Founder, Mudrex.\n\nOther crypto prices' today performance also improved as Tether, Stellar, XRP, Polkadot, Chainlink, XRP, Solana, Avalance, Polygon, Apecoin, Tron, Solana, Litecoin, Uniswap prices were trading with gains over the last 24 hours.\n\nBets that inflation is cooling and that the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of interest-rate hikes have helped all manner of assets at the start of 2023.

In this interview, we review 2022: the attacks on privacy, the reaffirmation of self-custody, how people who were treated like gods rekted the market, and the responsibility of Bitcoin podcasters in doing right by the audience.\n\n- - - -\n\n2022 has been brutal. First, tough lessons were learnt in trying to use Bitcoin for warranted privacy needs within North America. Then, we had our industry's very own global financial crisis when the tide went out and we saw how many of the supposed titans were swimming naked. So many people have been damaged, so many have been rekt.\n\nThe collateral damage to Bitcoin is unknown, but material. So much of that damage has come from malign and selfish actions by people who knew better. They have exploited a new form of money, which was meant to circumvent systemic centralized greed and corruption, to put into practice new more brutal forms of extraction than anything we witnessed in TradFi.\n\nBut, there are also those, whose actions have been made in good faith, who need to reflect on the events of the past year. We know where blame is centred, but how far does blame extend? Explicitly, what responsibilities do Bitcoin podcasters in general, and this Bitcoin podcaster in particular, have in regard to protecting and educating their audience?\n\n2022 has been personally brutal for a whole range of reasons. But, it is now time for reflection. It is right therefore that, as a show that assesses and comments on the industry, the tables are turned and a light is shone on this show\u2019s decision-making. There is nobody better than Odell to shine that light.\n\nFundamentally, it is the audience who will decide.

        "content": "Bitcoin lacked demand despite the impressive run of the first ten days in 2023\n\nA short term retreat could be likely depending on the CPI outcome as supply in profit spikes\n\nExpecting a return of the Bitcoin [BTC] bull market might sound too hasty despite the king coin resurgence above $17,000. CryptoQuant analyst, Cauceconomy opined this after assessing the condition of the Bitcoin demand.\n\nBTC, which had more green days than reds since 2023 began, had helped renew the enthusiasm of its investors. But for Cauceconomy, a significant breakout might be unlikely.\n\nAre your holdings flashing green? Check the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nTrading volume restraining demand\n\nAccording to his publication on the crypto data insight platform, Bitcoin\u2019s lack of demand could be traced to its network usage. This is because each block confirmation translates to increased daily transactions.\n\nHowever, that has not been the situation lately as miners have not necessarily been profitable to increase productivity by confirming more blocks. Hence, the trading volume has been repressed.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the BTC 24-hour trading volume was a 1.75% decrease at press time. This aligned with the analyst\u2019s reference to a dip in transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nBesides, Cauceconomy backed up his opinion by citing the historical trend. He pointed out that there was usually a notable breakout during the bear market before the bull season in previous cycles as shown by the above image. Meanwhile the current momentum displayed by BTC has shown nothing of such. The analyst said,\n\n\u201cFor us to have growth in the fundamentals of the network, we will need to see greater demand for trading and, consequently, higher fees for daily transactions. At this time, we haven\u2019t had that breakout yet and trading volume remains low, indicating low demand.\u201d\n\nOn evaluating the Bitcoin addresses with non-zero balance, Glassnode showed that there has been a slight decrease from the peak registered in November 2022.\n\nThe data at the time of writing, reported the number to be 43,170,375. Although this was a marginal difference, it suggested a lackluster perspective towards network utilization user base expansion.\n\nHow many BTCs can you get for $1?\n\nThe cause to take heed\n\nIn addition, another post on CryptoQuant warned optimistic investors of an impending price drop. On-chain analyst Gigisulivan was the one who raised the alarm after his assessment of the supply in profit percentage. At press time, the Bitcoin supply in profit percentage headed towards peaks, and was forming a divergence.\n\nLike Cauceconomy, he also referred to history as situations like that eventually led to a short term BTC pull back. For context, in 2018 and 2019, it only took a few days before the projected outcome happened. So, it might be the case as well considering the present circumstances.\n\nHowever, the analyst mentioned that macroeconomic factors would also have a say in the potential BTC trend. Therefore, the result of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on 12 January could determine if the supply in profit percentage goes ahead with the forecast."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Bitcoin SV: differences explained - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is the oldest cryptocurrency in existence. It is also the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation. However, over the years, there have been several offshoots of the Bitcoin blockchain. One of them is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). This article will explore the similarities and differences between BTC and BSV, and provide an overview of each currency's history, development, and current status. Let\u2019s begin by first understanding Bitcoin and the problems led to the creation of Bitcoin SV.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): What is it?\n\nLaunched in 2009, Bitcoin was the first decentralised digital currency come into existence. It was created by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. In a nutshell, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network that allows for the transfer of funds without the need for a central authority.\n\nBitcoin's primary goal is to be used as a global digital currency, and its design is focused on providing a decentralized and secure method of storing and transferring value. The currency has a maximum supply 21 million coins, of which more than 19.25 million coins are currently in circulation at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Scalability Problem\n\nScalability is Bitcoin\u2019s Achilles' heel. The network suffers from extremely slow transaction processing speeds. Moreover, if there is a surge in network traffic, transactions begin to pile up and processing fees tend to skyrocket. Currently, Bitcoin is able to process only seven transactions per second. This is no match for other payment networks such as Visa, which can handle up to 24,000 transactions per second.\n\nVarious solutions were proposed to address this problem, including increasing the block size, implementing off-chain scaling solutions, etc. However, to implement these changes, blockchains need to go through a process known as a \u2018fork\u2019. This is when the network splits into two; the new version carries the updated protocol whereas the older network is either abandoned or continues to operate using the old protocol.\n\nBitcoin Forks\n\nThe Bitcoin network has undergone multiple forks over the years. This is because users have put forth several improvement proposals to optimise the blockchain and keep it at par with external developments. Some of the notable Bitcoin forks include Bitcoin Cash (August 1, 2017), Bitcoin Gold (October 24, 2017), and Bitcoin SV (November 15, 2018).\n\nBitcoin Cash was created to implement a larger block size and improve the blockchain\u2019s scalability. Bitcoin Gold was created to make mining more decentralized after large firms began monopolising the mining process.\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV): What is it?\n\nThe proponents of BSV believe that Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s only intended scalability-oriented solution was increased block sizes. This is why they were originally onboard with the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. BCH introduced a larger block size of 8MB which was then bumped up to 32MB. This resulted in higher processing speeds of 116 transactions per second.\n\nHowever, as time went by, the developers behind Bitcoin Cash continued to implement structural changes to their protocol. BSV proponents shunned these changes, resulting in a hard fork that created BSV.\n\nTherefore, Bitcoin SV (BSV) is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) which in turn was a fork of Bitcoin (BTC). BSV was created in November 2018 by a group of individuals led by Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the original creator of Bitcoin. The main goal for BSV proponents was to restore the original Bitcoin protocol. They believe that the original Bitcoin white paper had a much more ambitious vision for the technology than what is currently being pursued by Bitcoin or any of its hard forks.\n\nThis is why they shunned BCH to create a blockchain that\u2019s more in line with Satoshi\u2019s original vision. Moreover, they do not support the current Bitcoin blockchain as it has undergone several network updates which are not in line with Satoshi\u2019s original whitepaper.\n\nHowever, since BSV is an offshoot of the original network, it bears several similarities with Bitcoin we know today. For instance, both blockchains use the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, they both have a circulation hard-cap of 21 million coins, and they also follow 4-year halving cycle. However, there are plenty of features that set the two blockchains apart as well.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of these differences\n\nScalability: One of the main differences between BTC and BSV is their approach to scalability. Bitcoin has a block size limit of 1 megabyte, which limits the number of transactions that can be processed per block. BSV, on the other hand, started with a much larger block size of 128MB. Over time, this has been increased to a massive 4GB.\n\nTransaction per second: As mentioned earlier, BTC can process only 7 transactions per second. However, BSV, with its 4GB block size, can process up to 50,000 TPS.\n\nFees: BTC usually has higher fees than BSV because of the smaller block size limit and a larger number of unconfirmed transactions.\n\nSmart contract support: The original Bitcoin network does not support smart contracts and NFTs. However, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision does and this could hold it in good stead in the future.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin went through a terrible crypto winter last year, the prices have gone up since the beginning of the new year, and at the time of writing, BTC was trading for $18,133.35, recording a value appreciation of 4.06 percent over the previous day. BSV on the other hand was trading at $41.41.\n\nConclusion\n\nBTC and BSV are both digital currencies based on blockchain technology, but there are some key differences between the two. BTC is focused on being a decentralized digital currency for storing and transferring value, while BSV is focused on becoming an enterprise-grade blockchain for business applications.\n\nHowever, the community support for BSV is very minimal. It's one of the reasons why mainstream crypto exchanges like Binance, Robinhood and Bitfinex are delisting BSV from their platforms. So, while BSV does have the potential to grow, its future looks far from certain."

Discover SCENE\n\nStock trading app Robinhood warned Wednesday it would soon end support for Bitcoin SV (BSV), with plans to delist the coin later this month.\n\nRobinhood users will no longer be able to buy, sell, or transfer Bitcoin SV after Jan. 25, according to a company update. Any remaining BSV in customer accounts after that will be automatically sold with users credited accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe have a rigorous framework in place to help us regularly review the crypto we offer on Robinhood,\u201d the company stated. \u201cWhile we do not discuss the process for assets on an individual basis, based on our latest review, we\u2019ve decided to end support for Bitcoin SV.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBSV is the only coin Robinhood said will be impacted by the delisting. The platform currently offers trading on 19 different tokens through its Robinhood Crypto service, including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe price of BSV fell sharply on Wednesday. Its price had decreased 11% to $39.11 over the past day as of this writing, according to data from CoinGecko. The figure represented a 92% decline in price from an all-time high of $489.75 set in April of 2021.\n\nBitcoin SV was first added to Robinhood\u2019s platform in November of 2018 after a hard fork involving Bitcoin Cash created the token. Bitcoin Cash itself is the result of a hard fork with Bitcoin\u2019s protocol.\n\nBitcoin Cash is now tradable again. We\u2019ve removed the halt following the hard fork. The fork produced a new asset, Bitcoin SV. BSV will be automatically distributed to BCH holders, who are entitled to one BSV per unit of BCH owned on the day of the fork (11/15). \u2014 Robinhood Help (@AskRobinhood) November 30, 2018\n\nA hard fork essentially creates two cryptocurrencies out of one, when changes made to a token through software updates make it incompatible with previous versions, resulting in two distinct branches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin SV, or \u201cSatoshi\u2019s Vision,\u201d is distinct from other versions of Bitcoin, including Bitcoin Cash, because of its larger block size, which results in reduced transaction fees.\n\nBSV is currently ranked 54 among all cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, with a total value of $745 million. It is significantly smaller than Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash with market capitalizations of $335 billion and $2 billion, respectively.\n\nThe token is only available on less than a handful of exchanges, such as OKX, KuCoin, and Huobi. Many exchanges have delisted the token from their platforms over time, including San Francisco-based OKCoin, which ended its support of BSV in February of 2021.\n\nBSV has been championed by Craig Wright, who has made unproven claims about being the true Satoshi Nakamato\u2013Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator\u2013since 2016.\n\nIn a defamation case against podcaster Peter McCormack, who had repeatedly called Wright a \u201cfraud\u201d for claiming to be Satoshi, a British court ruled Wright submitted \u201cdeliberately false\u201d evidence in August of last year.\n\nIn December, Wright\u2019s campaign to convince the masses that he created Bitcoin appeared to be coming to a close.\n\n\u201cI have been too angry for too long as I cared for external validation,\u201d he said in a Tweet. \u201cThe only validation I seek now is from my family and from seeing my ideas come to fruition and to be used by the world.\n\nIt does not matter if you like me. The goal of what I am doing is simple, global micropayments. One day, people will understand, not because it is inevitable, but because I will not give up on that goal and vision. We shall start to scale in 2023. Millions of TPS first... \u2014 Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) December 22, 2022\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The average crypto investor probably isn\u2019t planning on dying of old age anytime soon, but that doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t have a plan in place to pass on their crypto in the event they meet an unlikely demise, lawyers warn.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Dubai-based crypto lawyer Irina Heaver believes that \u201cbillions\u201d worth of Bitcoin (BTC) has been lost due to a lack of proper death-related planning by hodlers.\n\nShe noted that many families have been unable to access their loved one\u2019s crypto assets due to private keys being taken to the grave, and emphasized the importance of discussing crypto assets with family and including them in their will.\n\nHeaver said that the typical crypto investor is a \u201cmale millennial\u201d between the ages of 27 to 42, which is the age range where arranging one\u2019s financial affairs in case of death is the \u201clast thing\u201d to come up in conversation.\n\nHowever, the lawyer believes it is \u201cessential\u201d to confirm that the administrator of one\u2019s will is proficient in using cold and hot wallets in order to properly distribute one\u2019s holdings.\n\nDigital asset lawyer Liam Hennessy, partner at Australian law firm Gadens, believes that crypto investors should know that the \u201cvanilla first step\u201d to safeguarding their families\u2019 future is to prepare a will \u2014 but they should also be mindful that crypto is a complicated asset and that the will needs to include really specific instructions on where the crypto is and how the keys are accessed.\n\nHeaver has observed \u201chuge problems\u201d in the process of inheriting crypto, including a case where a family approached her asking for help in accessing a deceased loved one\u2019s crypto assets.\n\nDigital asset lawyer Krish Gosai, managing partner of Gosai law, believes that it is especially important to inform beneficiaries about crypto due to the lack of understanding surrounding digital assets.\n\nGosai believes it\u2019s important to inform the executor of the will or loved ones about the existence of crypto assets but advised against sharing sensitive login information or seed phrases, saying it isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nHe suggested that, if necessary, the seed phrase could be split among four family members.\n\nTax implications\n\nInheriting crypto can also be complex due to the differences in tax structures among jurisdictions.\n\nHeaver added that in some jurisdictions, there are inheritance taxes. For example, in the United Kingdom, crypto assets will be \u201cliable\u201d for inheritance tax on the death of the holder and capital gains tax on a valid disposal.\n\nRelated: Answering a morbid question: What happens to your Bitcoin when you die?\n\nIn Australia, there is no inheritance tax, but Heaver noted that there is a capital gains tax if one disposes of an asset inherited from a deceased estate.\n\nShe noted there are then jurisdictions where there are no taxes, like the United Arab Emirates.\n\nDigital asset lawyer Liam Hennessy, partner at Gadens, added that realizing digital assets at the best price can be another complication, due to factors such as price fluctuations and smart execution protocols."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDutch Bitcoin exchange Bitvavo said it had rejected Digital Currency Group\u2019s (DCG) proposal to repay 70% of Genesis Trading\u2019s debt, arguing that it should be able to pay back the entirety of locked funds.\n\nLast month, the Dutch exchange revealed it had \u20ac280 million ($297 million) stuck with Genesis, holding its parent company DCG accountable for the funds. In its latest blog post, Bitvavo said that on January 9 DCG made a proposal offering to refund 70% of the outstanding amount in a period acceptable to the Dutch exchange.\n\nPer the exchange, \u201cthe latter is not acceptable because DCG has sufficient funds available for full repayment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitvavo is the Netherlands\u2019 leading crypto exchange with a trading volume of more than $46 million in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko.\n\nAlthough DCG maintained the funds are held by its \u201cindependent subsidiary\u201d Genesis, not DCG itself, the firm now appears to be willing to find a solution, with Bitvavo confirming active conversations with DCG to recover the resulting debt \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe exchange has also been adamant that recent events won't affect its users.\n\n\u201cAs consistently stated before, the current situation regarding DCG does not impact Bitvavo's customers, its platform and its services. Bitvavo has guaranteed the outstanding amount and thus assumed the risk on behalf of its customers,\u201d Bitvavo said in yesterday\u2019s blog post.\n\nThe Dutch exchange also weighed in on the ongoing feud between DCG and Gemini, citing the New York-based exchange\u2019s open letter that accuses DCG boss Silbert of deception and fraud and calls for his resignation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLike Gemini, we share the confidence that a solution can be found to the satisfaction of all concerned,\u201d said Bitvavo.\n\nA Bitvavo spokesperson told Decrypt there was nothing else the exchange could disclose beyond what\u2019s stated in the blog. DCG and Genesis did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBitvavo piles on Genesis, DCG\n\nGenesis froze withdrawals from its lending arm on November 18, 2022, blaming FTX\u2019s collapse for \u201cabnormal withdrawal requests\u201d that exceeded its liquidity.\n\nIn a consequent letter to shareholders, DCG CEO Barry Silbert revealed the crypto conglomerate owed its own Genesis Trading arm as much as $575 million worth of intercompany loans due in May 2023. Additionally, DCG owes Genesis $1.1 billion on a promissory note due in June 2032 related to the default of Three Arrows Capital.\n\nPer a Reuters November report, aside from the money owed to Genesis, DCG\u2019s only debt was a $350 million credit facility from a small group of lenders led by investment firm Eldridge, with Silbert saying at the time the firm was still on pace to do $800 million in revenue last year.\n\nThere were more woes for Genesis in the past few weeks though, with the firm announcing a 30% cut to its workforce at the beginning of January, and Federal prosecutors in New York, along with the SEC, launching an investigation into DCG\u2019s internal transfers with its lending subsidiary."

        "title": "14 years since the first Bitcoin transaction: Peer-to-peer electronic cash lives on - CoinGeek",
        "content": "On January 12, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto sent renowned cryptographer Hal Finney the first Bitcoin transaction.\n\nIt consisted of 10 bitcoins and is forever recorded on the blockchain. Apart from Satoshi, Finney was the first to run the Bitcoin software and tweeted about it the day before he received the first coins.\n\nRunning bitcoin \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 11, 2009\n\nFinney contributed to Bitcoin, but he was not Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Hal Finney contributed massively to the development of Bitcoin in the early days. In his own words, he carried on a lengthy email correspondence with Satoshi, working out bugs and fixing them as he went.\n\n\u201cI mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test \u2014 I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.\u201d\n\nDr. Craig Wright, now legally recognized as Bitcoin\u2019s inventor, has credited Finney for his help, stating that there were many bugs in the code that he helped fix.\n\nHowever, despite popular opinion, Finney was not Bitcoin\u2019s inventor. When you think about it, it makes little sense for him to have emailed himself, talking about bugs and fixing them, in Bitcoin\u2019s early days.\n\nWhile Finney is a fan favorite, and many people still believe he is the man behind the Satoshi pseudonym, that\u2019s just not true. The man behind the mask was Australian polymath Dr. Craig Wright.\n\nIs Hal Finney the man behind bitcoin? No. No, he isn't, but he was a VERY cool dude, and it was a lot of fun re-reading all of his posts and his emails again over the last month or so while writing. Please read and SHARE. https://t.co/e7Pkg3dBtc#runningbitcoin #bitcoin \u2014 Kurt Wuckert Jr \ud83d\udfe1 GorillaPool.com (@kurtwuckertjr) January 10, 2023\n\nNonetheless, Finney deserves credit for his contributions to Bitcoin. The developer of the PGP encryption system played a pivotal role in making Bitcoin work and will forever be remembered as the first person to receive a transaction.\n\nThe original Bitcoin has been restored\n\nWhen Finney received the 10 bitcoins from Satoshi, Bitcoin was in its original state. Despite a few bugs, it was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that functioned with almost zero fees.\n\nThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime. \u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nSince those days, BTC Core developers and other vested interests, such as Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group, have attempted to hijack and suppress Bitcoin, keeping its scalability and data management potential under wraps.\n\nHowever, 14 years on, the original Bitcoin has been restored; the low-fee, infinitely scalable electronic cash system outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto is back. These days, it\u2019s known by its ticker symbol BSV, and Satoshi Nakamoto, now known by his real name Dr. Craig Wright\u2014is working relentlessly with his team at nChain to make it scale to millions and eventually billions of transactions per second.\n\nThis time, Bitcoin won\u2019t be used for criminal purposes as it was the first time around. Using the legal system, a process is being developed to recover stolen digital assets, and with Bitcoin\u2019s innate traceability, the world will soon understand that it\u2019s the worst possible thing to use for crime.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is growing\n\nJanuary 12, 2009, will forever be remembered as the day the first Bitcoin transaction occurred. However, a few years from now, on the same date, it\u2019s likely that billions of such transactions will occur. These are being powered by an ever-growing number of apps utilizing Bitcoin micropayments.\n\nThe original Bitcoin is back, and despite the best efforts of its enemies, it can not and will not be stopped this time!\n\nWatch: Digital Asset Recovery on Bitcoin\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "\n\n\n\nEl Salvador has recently passed a law that establishes a legal framework for the creation of a Bitcoin-backed bond, called the \"Volcano Bond\", which will be used to pay off government debt and finance the construction of a planned city called \"Bitcoin City\".\n\n\n\nThe name \"Volcano\" for the bonds comes from the fact that the proposed location of \"Bitcoin City\" is near the Conchagua volcano and will be powered by its hydrothermal energy.\n\nEl Salvador's National Bitcoin Office announced the passing of the bill in a tweet and stated that they would start issuing the bonds soon. The law passed with a majority vote of 62 to 16 and is expected to be signed by the President, Nayib Bukele.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitfinex, a crypto exchange, has stated that the \"Volcano Bond\" or \"Volcano Tokens\" will enable El Salvador to gather funds for paying off government debt, building the \"Bitcoin City\" and setting up Bitcoin mining operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitfinex added that the \"Bitcoin City\" will be a special economic zone, similar to those in China, that offers tax breaks and favourable regulations for crypto businesses to attract residents. The bonds aim to raise $1 billion for the country, with half of it going towards building the special economic zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamson Mow, a supporter of Bitcoin who is also involved in the development of the \"Volcano Token\", has stated that the new Digital Securities Law and the ability to create new financial instruments like the Bitcoin Bonds will help the country pay off its existing debts and be critical in transforming it into a major financial centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill also creates a legal framework for all digital assets, not just those issued on Bitcoin, and establishes a new regulatory agency that will be responsible for enforcing the securities law and protecting against fraudulent activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tokenised bonds are planned to be denominated in US dollars, have a maturity of 10 years, and carry an annual interest rate of 6.5 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia.

        "content": "Bitcoin experienced a significant bull run on Monday due to the U.S. job report that came in better-than-expected for December, alleviating investor concerns about rate hikes. While the dollar lost strength, stocks rose sharply in Europe, Asia, and the United States. The cryptocurrency market similarly mirrored the optimistic outlook of the stock market globally, with Bitcoin appearing as one of the top moving tokens.\n\nAltcoin accumulators are over the moon as Bitcoin and altcoins welcome a weekend pump. Major L1s like Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Cosmos, Solana, and Polkadot register double-digit gains.\n\nBut is the pump healthy? Does it change any of the existing bearishness?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the traditional market situations. Inflation is still high, although the growth of inflation is going down. That doesn\u2019t mean the economy is on track to healthy inflation.\n\nU.S. Regulations in 2023\n\nThe aftermath of FTX\u2019s collapse will predominate in American talks on crypto-regulatory issues. And finally, Sam Bankman-Fried was indicted on eight counts, including money laundering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and securities fraud, and is currently on American soil.\n\nMembers of the U.S. Congress are still advocating for safety measures in the wake of FTX\u2019s demise, such as the proposed Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act.\n\nAdditionally, the regulatory discussion will likely center on stablecoins. With a record $7T settled in 2022, stablecoins have proven their product-market fit and are widely employed in DeFi applications, for international trade, and as a practical medium of exchange.\n\nHowever, stablecoin governance continues to be a crucial topic for legislative discussion, particularly in light of novel vulnerabilities like the use of admin keys.\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, which hold different opinions on cryptocurrencies, govern the SEC. We may observe moderation in the SEC\u2019s stance toward cryptocurrencies as new representatives take over the House Financial Service Committee.\n\nThe CFTC, under the oversight of the Senate Agriculture Committee and House Agriculture Committee, is anticipated to take a more favorable position toward digital assets.\n\nAs the SEC and CFTC determine whose jurisdiction will rule over exchanges, stablecoins, and cryptocurrency security status, we can anticipate further moves on the U.S. regulatory front.\n\nWhat Is the Fed\u2019s Strategy?\n\nRecent CPI data suggests that the Fed does not want to hurt the market to fix the rampant inflation. So the million-dollar question is: What could be the response of the Fed in the coming quarters?\n\nSigns of recession in the housing and manufacturing sector are clearly the themes of 2023. That means house rents might fall rapidly over the next few quarters, and land/building costs will follow the trajectory. It also provides an opportunity for real estate investment, but we are crypto travelers.\n\nBut would it be overwhelming to suggest that investing in real estate is possible with crypto? Let\u2019s look at the project $RIO.\n\nRealio Network is a crypto-based real-world assets investment project. It has a market cap of $1.1 million and a fully diluted valuation of $1.6 million. The project is currently in the testnet phase on the Ethereum, Algorand, and Stellar networks.\n\nBack to the Feds, the interest rate hike is set to be a regular phenomenon. The inflation target of 2% can be fatal to the market if executed at a go. But a slower path seems to be in the best of everyone\u2019s interests. Stocks shall continue to bleed, and Bitcoin shall retest the lows.\n\nHowever, the Fed plans to increase the interest rates to 5% over the year. That means constant sell pressure from seasonal investors.\n\nStatus of Fed Net Assets\n\nFed Net Assets are the total assets in the Fed balance sheet. Historically, during a bull run, Feds increase asset holdings because they outperform cash. Similarly, in a bear market, Feds decrease asset holdings because cash can retain value more than credit-based assets.\n\nCrypto Hedge Fund Ouroboros Capital reflects that in each low in net assets, the stock market finds a new low.\n\nSince April 2022, this is the worst drawdown liquidity. The last three times this data point printed a new low, we immediately witnessed SPX print a new low (red circles). Equities should quickly catch up to the spread.\n\nIt could be yet another bloodbath for Bitcoin and altcoins, as FUD around Huobi going illiquid remain strong.

        "content": "As the cryptocurrency industry continues to expand, crypto mining is one of the most popular ways to earn passive income, and many crypto mining enthusiasts are wondering how they can increase the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) they generate.\n\nOne of the options is running an overclocked mining machine. However, while overclocking a Bitcoin miner by putting a second power supply on it seems like an attractive idea, a question arises as to whether this is actually worth it, especially when taking into account the variable electricity costs.\n\nWith this in mind, crypto YouTuber Drew Vosk has decided to put an overclocked ASIC miner to the test, to check how much Bitcoin he can mine with it, as well as how much electricity it uses up, demonstrating the results of this experiment in a video published on January 10.\n\nOverclocking Bitcoin miner\n\nTo overclock a Bitcoin miner requires adding an additional power supply, which requires an additional power supply cable. For this purpose, Vosk used a miner with such a capability \u2013 MicroBT Whatsminer M30S+, which originally comes with a 3,400w power capable of producing 100 terahashes (T/s) per second.\n\nThis miner is then tuned to produce 139 T/s at 5,500w, in order to demonstrate the overclocking capability. M30S+ uses dual power modification. In other words, it comes with pre-installed Manifold Mining dual PSU modification, which results in a maximum power availability of 6,000w.\n\nWhen running a mining machine of such power, it is always important to keep in mind the level of noise it produces, especially when it is used in the highest setting. Therefore, its location is of tremendous importance.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nSince putting the miner on the highest overclock setting, Vosk reported achieving a reliable and stable daily result of over 134 T/s. Taking into account the current BTC price and the ViaBTC mining pool fees, this earned him about $8, which isn\u2019t profitable from a residential mining point of view but can still be if super-cheap electricity is available.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t, then a non-2PSU version of the miner might be a better-suited and more economical option. Finally, as Vosk concludes, mining with an overclocked machine is basically a numbers game that boils down to comparing one\u2019s electricity rates and the value of Bitcoin generated.\n\nElsewhere, ASIC mining is among Vosk\u2019s suggestions of various options to mine Bitcoin as an alternative to mining using graphics cards or graphics processing units (GPUs), others being hard drive mining, 5G mining, and Equihash mining, as Finbold reported.\n\nOn the other hand, if independence from the local grid and offsetting the energy waste produced by mining Bitcoin is what you\u2019re looking for, then using solar power instead might be the right choice, although the results might vary.\n\nWatch the entire video below:"

The New York attorney-general\u2019s office also sued Nexo for \u201cfalsely representing that it complies with applicable regulations and licensing requirements\u201d.\n\nBy December, Nexo said it would begin phasing out its products and services in the US because the country refused to \u201cprovide a path forward for enabling blockchain businesses\u201d. The company added at the time that it exited New York as part of a \u201cco-operative approach with regulators\u201d.\n\n\n\nBulgaria\u2019s accusations also come in the wake of a tumultuous time for the crypto-lending industry. High-profile lending platforms such as Celsius and BlockFi collapsed into bankruptcy after prices of tokens such as bitcoin and luna crashed, leaving Nexo as one of the few remaining actors in the market. Sofia prosecutors said more than $94bn had passed through Nexo over the past five years.\n\n\n\nBulgarian authorities said the main organisers of the scheme being investigated were Bulgarian citizens and the suspected activity had been carried out mainly in Bulgarian territory.\n\n\u201cEvidence has been gathered that a person who used the platform and transferred cryptocurrencies has been officially declared a person who finances terrorist acts,\u201d the prosecutor added.\n\nNexo said authorities were making anti-money laundering and tax-related inquiries about a Bulgarian entity of the group \u201cthat is not customer facing but only has back-office functions \u2014 payrolls, customer support and compliance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are authorities at one of Nexo\u2019s offices in Bulgaria, which, as you know, is the most corrupt country in the EU\u201d, it said. Nexo was \u201cone of the most stringent entities with regards to know-your-customer and anti-money laundering,\u201d it said.\n\nA spokesperson for the platform added that Nexo was \u201cco-operating fully\u201d with Bulgarian authorities."

And there are inactive wells that need plugging.\n\nLegislators asked new School and Public Lands Commissioner Brock Greenfield who is ultimately responsible for making sure the leases are paid and wells that need to be plugged are capped.\n\nGreenfield said he was.\n\n\u201cIt falls on me,\u201d Greenfield, a former legislator, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get answers to you.

Committee Co-Chair Sen. Jean Hunhoff (R-Yankton) did ask that DANR be ready to answer legislators\u2019 questions about the natural gas wells in a subsequent hearing.\n\nCopyright 2023 KOTA.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nNorthern Data AG, a German firm focused on Bitcoin mining and cloud computing, has announced the financial results of its mining operations. They mined 2,798 Bitcoins in the 2022 fiscal year, which is a 315 percent increase from the previous year.\n\n\n\nNorthern Data generated 77.7 million euros in revenue from BTC mining in 2022. Additionally, the company sold 3,005 Bitcoins for a mean price of 23,849 euros, resulting in a cash revenue of 71.7 million euros.\n\nNorthern Data also shared in their data release that they had 3.6 exahash per second of computing power allocated to Bitcoin mining. They also projected that their consolidated revenues would be between 190 million to 194 million euros, and their EBITDA adjusted for losses from crypto trading would be between 40 million to 50 million euros.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, December was a difficult month for Northern Data. They mined 177 Bitcoins, which is a 15 percent decrease from November and a 25 percent decrease from December of the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decline was caused by high energy prices, which led to some of the ASIC machines being out of service at certain times, unable to produce continuously. The company stated that it is moving its ASIC machines to locations with more favourable energy prices to improve production stability and optimise capacity utilisation in order to reach its goal of mining 350 Bitcoins per month.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, some Bitcoin mining firms have encountered difficulties due to the rising difficulty of mining and the cost of electricity. This has resulted in a reduction in mining profitability and led some miners to close their operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, some companies have reported substantial increases in revenue and mining power, thanks to improved mining equipment and optimisation of mining software.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings, one of the biggest BTC mining operations in North America, has been testing the process of overclocking to gain a competitive edge in the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the update released by the company, it mined 475 Bitcoins in December, bringing the total mined for the 2022 fiscal year to 4,144 Bitcoins, which is a 30 percent increase from the 3,197 Bitcoins mined in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

        "content": "On 11 January, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador passed the bill on Bitcoin-backed bonds, also known as Volcano Bonds, with 62 votes for and 16 against it, and the said bill is set to become law after being ratified by President Bukele.\n\nHere, it must be noted that the name Volcano Bonds has been derived from the location of El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin City, which is set to become a renewable crypto-mining hub energised by hydrothermal energy from the country\u2019s active volcanos.\n\nThe Central American country, in November 2021, revealed that it was planning to raise $1 billion through bitcoin-backed bonds. The issuance of these bonds was initially planned for March 2022. However, it had to be postponed several times owing to the onset of the brutal crypto winter since last year.\n\nIt must be noted that these bonds would be denominated in US dollars, have a 10-year maturity date, and carry a 6.5 percent annual interest rate, as per their initial proposal.\n\nWhat would Bitcoin City offer?\n\nAs per Bitfinex, a renowned crypto exchange and the technology provider for the Volcano bonds, issuance of Bitcoin-backed bonds would allow El Salvador to raise capital to pay for its sovereign debt, fund the building of the Bitcoin City as well as help in the creation of the Bitcoin mining infrastructure.\n\nThe exchange further claims that the proposed Bitcoin City would be a special economic zone similar to those seen in China. They would offer tax advantages, and crypto-friendly regulations, as well as incentivise Bitcoin businesses for its residents.\n\nPublished By: Jasmine anand Published On: Jan 12, 2023 --- ENDS ---"

        "content": "Crypto adoption in India is being driven primarily by the GenZ and millennial population. An overwhelming majority of crypto investors in the country fall in the 18-25 (45 per cent) and 26-35 (34 per cent) age groups, found a 2022 analysis by homegrown crypto exchange CoinSwitch.\n\nCrypto, truly, is a young person\u2019s asset class, with just 8 per cent of retail investors above 45 years of age.\n\nIn 2022, which brought about a bloodbath for the global crypto industry, Indian investors shied away from panic selling, and instead, held on to their investments. New investors too started building their crypto portfolio in the bear market to complement their equity investments.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most valuable crypto, continues to be the most popular token in India, with 12.12 per cent of investments going towards it. This is followed by investments in DOGE (11.54 per cent), Ethereum (9.43 per cent), Shiba Inu (6.92 per cent), and Polygon (4.3 per cent). Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are meme coins, which are inspired by internet memes, and are more volatile than the rest.\n\n\u201cIndia set aside 40 per cent of its crypto investments on top dollar CRE8 coins and DeFi utility tokens in 2022, and only about 6 per cent in metaverse tokens. In fact, a greater share of investments (~8 per cent) was made on Ethereum alternatives (Layer1 networks that rival the blue-chip smart-contract chain) than metaverse tokens,\u201d CoinSwitch revealed in its report.\n\nDelhi ranked on top in terms of crypto investments (by value) in the country. This was followed by the IT hubs of Bangalore and Hyderabad. \u201cJaipur has the highest crypto adoption among tier-2 and tier-3 cities, followed by Lucknow and Pune,\u201d CoinSwitch stated.\n\nCrypto, meanwhile, continues to be a male-dominated sector, with only 8 per cent of CoinSwitch\u2019s 19 million users being women in 2022. A prior analysis by global crypto exchange KuCoin had pegged India\u2019s overall crypto population at 115 million, with 52 per cent of them investing in the asset class to generate a passive income.\n\nAlso Read: Budget 2023: CoinSwitch expects govt to incentivise crypto users and 'reduce the burden of taxes'"

        "content": "The global price of Bitcoin, the most successful cryptocurrency, fell by 65.29 per cent in 2022.\n\nThis came as the adoption of digital currencies fell in a year rocked by crypto scandals, with the fall of FTX dominating the airwaves. According to data from coinmarketcap.com, the price of BTC fell from $47,686.81 as of January 01, 2022, to $16,547.50 as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThis is as the market capitalisation of BTC fell by 64.69 per cent from $902.10bn at the beginning of 2022 to $318.52bn at the end of 2022. After reaching record highs during the pandemic, with many analysts suggesting it would reach $100,000, the price of BTC took a beating in 2022.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, a blockchain insight firm, the global adoption of BTC and other cryptocurrencies has leveled off after growing consistently since mid-2019. It stated that the global adoption of crypto reached its present all-time high in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite this fall, emerging markets like Nigeria continue to dominate crypto adoption. In its \u2018The 2022 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,\u2019 Chainalysis explained, \u201cOne trend we noted last year has only gotten stronger this year: Emerging markets dominate the index.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cTen are lower middle income: Vietnam, Philippines, Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Morocco, Nepal, Kenya, and Indonesia. Eight are upper-middle income: Brazil, Thailand, Russia, China, Turkey, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador. Two are high income: United States and United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm, the reason for this dominance is that users of crypto in countries like Nigeria use cryptocurrency to send remittances, preserve their savings in times of fiat currency volatility, and fulfill other financial needs unique to their economies.\n\nDespite this fall in market value, BTC investment by Nigerians grew by five per cent in 2022 according to a The PUNCH report. Paxful, one of the major peer-to-peer crypto firms, said, \u201cNigeria is our largest country based on trade volume.\n\n\u201cTrading volume in the country grew by over 5 per cent y-o-y from January through September (looking at 2022/2021 data).\u201d\n\nData from the firm also confirmed that BTC trade from the nation had reached about N171.50bn ($400m) from January to June 2022.\n\nNigerians\u2019 investment in Bitcoin grew by over five per cent in 2022. In an earlier report, The PUNCH had reported that BTC traders were lamenting their losses because of the downturn in the price of BTC.\n\nOne trader, who asked not to be named, said, \u201cI have been in crypto for a while. In the past few weeks, let\u2019s say about eight weeks if anyone tells you they\u2019ve not lost money they are lying.\n\n\u201cLoses is part of this. On a personal level, and with my firm, we\u2019ve lost about N40m, this is to be conservative. We are big traders. I won\u2019t call it a loss though, because as long as you are still in the market, you will still get your money back. But on a temporary level, if we close our position now, we would be forfeiting nothing less than that amount.\u201d\n\nWhile the price of BTC has rebounded to $17,348.36 as of 5:15pm Nigerian time on Wednesday, a sense of impending doom remains.\n\nA financial expert, Kalu Aja, on Twitter recently (Tuesday, 10, 2022) asked crypto users to withdraw their assets. He tweeted, \u201cIf you have any crypto assets staked, it will be prudent to withdraw. Yes withdraw.\u201d"

        "content": "BTC/USDT 1-Hour Price Analysis (Source- TradingView)\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin (BTC), the market leader in cryptocurrencies, has increased somewhat during the past 24 hours. BTC\u2019s price is currently $18,111.36 at the time of publication, up 3.82% from the previous day.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price has marginally increased after breaking out of the channel. reaching a daily high of $18,268.55. The price of Bitcoin is still very close to its 24-hour high despite the retracement. The price of bitcoin today is $18,111.36.\n\nAt the press time, Bitcoin has been trading above the 200-day moving average line. After triggering the bullish flag, the Bollinger bands are expanding with the upper Bollinger band present at $18,523, while the lower Bollinger band is at $17,091. It suggests that the price will stay bullish in the near future. The relative strength index is at the level of 71.90, indicating that BTC/USD will not reach a future high in the near future and drop since it is in the overbought zone.\n\nThe hourly price chart reveals that bulls have been seizing the lead in the market, which has significantly weakened the bears\u2019 position from earlier hours and increased the bullish momentum. Given the price\u2019s sharp rise, the momentum has been comparatively stronger. However, for Bitcoin to move higher, it still needs to cross its recent flimsy high.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin will continue to go sideways for a while since it recently faced a big spike, making buyers and sellers struggle to take control of the market. Moreover, investors need to wait for the CPI data which will be released today since it always has a big impact on the crypto market.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Two Major Crypto Price Predictions: Bitcoin and Ethereum - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "BTC/USDT 1-Hour Price Analysis (Source \u2013 TradingView)\n\nLooking at the Bitcoin 1-Hour chart, the analysis shows that Bitcoin has been trading above the 200-day MA and the 50-day MA. It means that we are now experiencing an introduction to the bull reign. And the 50-day MA is over the 200-day and the distance between the two moving averages is wide, which are good signs for a bull run.\n\nThe resistance of BTC lies at $17550.46 and $17597.18, while the support is at the previous strong low, $16889.01. Moreover, there is an order block placed around $17222.60 and $17139.74, whereas buyers are waiting for a reversal miracle to happen. The RSI of Bitcoin is positioned at 62 which is a strong area, so we can expect a price reversal at an RSI level of 70.\n\nETH/USDT 1-Hour Price Analysis (Source \u2013 TradingView)\n\nAnother major cryptocurrency in the market, Ethereum has been positively fluctuating since the start of 2023. Moreover, the RSI of Ethereum is at 57.24. Seeing the price trading closely above the 50-day MA indicates that we can expect a sideways market for a while. It is more advisable to wait for a certain breakout to one side of the channel and take the trade to achieve a better risk-to-reward ratio.\n\nThe price is also above 200-day MA since the bulls can reverse the price from the downtrend. The bearish scenario is likely to happen if Ethereum breaks the lower trendline of the rising wedge. If so, we can expect Ethereum\u2019s bearish price will be $1,270. Another possible scenario is that Ethereum\u2019s price can reach $1,380.\n\nHowever, investors need to look out for the Consumer Price Index data which will be released tomorrow, January 12, 2023, for more liquidity pull and rugs.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "It\u2019s 14 years since the first Bitcoin (BTC) transaction was initiated, with its anonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto acting as the sender.\n\nFor the transaction that occurred on January 12, 2009, Nakamoto transferred the 10 BTC to computer scientist Hal Finney, the first-ever recipient on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nCommenting on the transaction, Peter Smith, the CEO of Bitcoin blockchain explorer platform Blockchain.com noted it was a period of \u2018planting seeds.\u2019\n\n14 years ago today, the first P2P transaction occurred between Satoshi and Hal Finney for 10 BTC.\n\n\n\nHuge ideas take time, they were planting seeds 14 years ago for all of us today! pic.twitter.com/vCNTmht7ah \u2014 Peter Smith (@OneMorePeter) January 11, 2023\n\nFinney\u2019s prominence in the crypto space\n\nNotably, Finney has over the years gained prominence in the cryptocurrency space, as he was among the first people to embrace Bitcoin, even mining the asset. In this line, Finney is also among the few individuals who are known to have communicated with Satoshi.\n\n\u201cWhen Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test,\u201d he said in a previous post.\n\nFurthermore, Finney became famous for the first Bitcoin tweet ever in 2009 when he appeared to project the asset\u2019s potential.\n\nRunning bitcoin \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 11, 2009\n\nBitcoin\u2019s growth\n\nSince the first transaction, Bitcoin has evolved over the years. For instance, in 2009, when the first transaction was initiated, the maiden cryptocurrency was mainly in an experimental stage.\n\nThe growth of the asset is also highlighted by a recent Finbold report that noted that the Bitcoin blockchain saw over $8 trillion in transactions in 2022 despite the bear market.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the asset\u2019s growth has resulted in Bitcoin receiving different use cases, for example, DeFi on Bitcoin, to emerge as an investment asset and a payment option. Overall, Bitcoin is moving to emerge as a mainstream finance product.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has emerged among the best-performing assets over the last decades despite undergoing phases of significant price correction.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "With the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry expanding at a high rate, major names in technology are taking an interest, including South Korean electronics giant Samsung, which has recently announced the launch of a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong.\n\nSpecifically, Samsung said that the listing of the \u2018Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF\u2019 on the Hong Kong stock market would take place on January 13, according to the report by the Korean media outlet Fortune Korea published on January 12.\n\nThe listing will be carried out by the company\u2019s investment branch Samsung Asset Management and follows the launch of two other ETFs by the electronics company \u2013 \u2018Samsung Blockchain Technology ETF\u2019 and \u2018Samsung Asia Pacific Metabus ETF,\u2019 which were listed earlier last year.\n\nThe newly-listed ETF will keep track of the spot price of Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin futures products listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), with a special focus on the CME Bitcoin Futures and CME Micro-Bitcoin Futures.\n\nCommenting on the development, Park Seong-jin, the head of Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong, said that:\n\n\u201cThe Samsung Bitcoin ETF is a competitive product that reflects the know-how and risk management experience of Samsung\u2019s long-term operation of the futures-based ETFs, which will represent a new option for investors interested in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nInterest in crypto\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung is well-known for its interest in Web3 technologies. As early as 2019, the electronics giant featured a crypto wallet app inside its flagship smartphone Samsung Galaxy S10, facilitating the secure storage of private keys and crypto holdings management through hardware-based mechanisms.\n\nIn October 2022, it announced a \u201cprivate blockchain\u201d security system for its smart devices called Knox Matrix, which aims to enhance the safety of a multiple-device environment by having each smart device monitor the activity of others and share access data, improving the logging-in process.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, earlier in June, Finbold reported on the South Korean company beginning the production of the efficient and energy-saving 3nm chips, which are compatible with specific integrated circuits (ASICs) machines known to be effective for mining Bitcoin (BTC), its first customer being a Chinese ASIC manufacturer PanSemi."

        "content": "Time passes and from the Fork from which it originated until today, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has not only lost value but also its appeal to exchanges, let\u2019s take a look together at the health of the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is back just below \u20ac17,000, appreciating by 1.21% in the past 24 hours (\u20ac16,871.08), but how would it have fared if it had never undergone any upgrades over the past 13 years? By looking at the trend of Bitcoin SV (BSV) we can get a fairly likely idea.\n\nBitcoin SV, or commonly referred to as \u201cSatoshi\u2019s Vision,\u201d consists of larger blocks that result in smaller fees.\n\nThe digital currency takes shape from the fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in 2018 and aims to restore BTC\u2019s primary algorithm.\n\nTo date, with $745 million, Bitcoin SV (BSV) occupies 54th place in the market capitalization ranking but is well behind the heights of Bitcoin ($335 billion) or Bitcoin Cash ($2 billion).\n\nThe price of Bitcoin SV is down nearly 7% (6.82%) in the last week and as of yesterday, as much as 9.81% bringing it to \u20ac39.16, one-twelfth the value from the all-time high of \u20ac457.05.\n\nAs of today, Bitcoin SV is on the market with a supply of 19,266,076.644 units.\n\nDespite the curious comparison with the more emblazoned Bitcoin, BSV is traded on very few exchanges and among them, we find OKX, KuCoin, Huobi and Robinhood.\n\nRobinhood, itself, in a statement recently warned its users that those holding Bitcoin SV on the exchange have until 25 January to transfer or sell their BSV assets.\n\nWhen it comes to buying, the exchange of the world\u2019s most famous archer has already imposed a blockade and specified that if there are still Bitcoin SV on the exchange platform as of 26 January, they will be sold automatically.\n\n\u201cWe have a rigorous framework in place to help us regularly review the cryptocurrencies we offer on Robinhood. While we do not discuss the process for assets on an individual basis, based on our latest review, we have decided to end support for Bitcoin SV.\u201d\n\nThe price of Bitcoin SV (BSV) has dropped a great deal since the beginning of the year and according to CoinGecko\u2019s analysis, this is enough to explain the fears of the Menlo Park-based exchange and the choice made which puts the safety of investors at the forefront and emphasizes the fact that, the digital currency, has lost 92% from its all-time high putting it in a bad light and comparing it almost to a shit coin.\n\nTo date Bitcoin SV (BSV) is tradable on very few platforms and most exchanges are removing the token from their selection, in order of time the last one had been OKCoin and now it seems to be the turn of the American company Robinhood Markets Inc which stated the following:\n\n\u201cWe are extremely selective about the resources we offer as we build towards our goal of making Robinhood Crypto the most reliable, lowest cost, and easiest to use on the ramp to crypto.\u201d\n\nAs Bitcoin SV meets a grim fate, Bitcoin seems to be showing interesting signs and regaining some of the dominance it lost over time and with it volatility.\n\nDigital Gold is back to traveling around the \u20ac17,000 mark and this is also good considering the fact that it has taken back the 200 EMA but it is too early to say that the trend has definitely changed.\n\nOne piece of evidence in plain sight is that there is more hype and that volatility has definitely returned for both BTC and the other cryptocurrencies."
