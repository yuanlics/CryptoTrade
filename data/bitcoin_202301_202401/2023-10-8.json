        "content": "It's helpful to view these numbers in the context of their year-to-date performance, where Bitcoin has gained an impressive 64%, and Ether has risen by 41%. This underscores the resilience of these cryptocurrencies as some of the top-performing assets in 2023. This quarterly outperformance of BTC versus ETH and the broader CMI is a continuation of a trend we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. Institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to support BTC, while the continued regulatory pressure on alternative tokens drives the bifurcation in the crypto market between the established majors (Bitcoin and Ether) and other digital asset protocols and projects."

        "title": "Israel-Palestine Conflict: Bitcoin and Gold's Reaction to War Following Ukraine Invasion - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict has not affected the Bitcoin market.\n\nRegardless of local political unrest, cryptos can operate globally according to the fundamental decentralization idea.\n\nExtended crises due to government borrowing or money printing may boost BTC\u2019s appeal as an inflation hedge.\n\nThe Israel war\u2019s impact on BTC price is uncertain, with traders drawing parallels to the uncertainty during the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.\n\nThe world has become more aware of the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East due to the recent Israel-Palestine conflict . While the unrest has wide-ranging effects, one aspect often considered a safe haven in times of unrest has remained unaffected: the stability of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price.\n\nAdaptability of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has demonstrated resilience in its price despite the rising violence and the significant effects the conflict in the Middle East has had on the lives of both Israelis and Palestinians. The price of the digital asset fluctuated very little over the course of the weekend as the conflict developed. This went against some predictions and assertions people held.\n\nBTC was trading at around $28,000 just hours after Israel formally proclaimed a state of war. This represents a 0.20% decrease in value over the last 24 hours.\n\nIn the past, big market reactions have frequently been brought on by geopolitical crises. Bitcoin, on the other hand, seems to be an exception to this trend, as it showed a similar pattern during the present crisis and was largely untouched during the brief Israeli-Gaza conflict in 2021.\n\nThe Gaza Factor\n\nGaza has a population of about two million people and has been severely damaged by the war. Although it would be expected to have some degree of Bitcoin adoption, due to its relatively tiny population, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the market for cryptocurrencies worldwide.\n\nHamas, a Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist organization involved in the conflict, has even asked for donations in Bitcoin before, but the volume of these transactions was insufficient to have a meaningful impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price. This begs the question of whether variables outside the scope of the conflict\u2019s impact may be responsible for Bitcoin\u2019s immunity to geopolitical instability.\n\nThe Financial Importance of Bitcoin\n\nThe financial importance of Bitcoin may be one reason for its lack of interest in the Israel-Palestine issue. Even if the tension has clearly caused personal misery and unrest, it is debatably not currently a financial concern on a global or cryptocurrency level.\n\nSince it is a decentralized digital money, national economies and conventional financial institutions do not influence how Bitcoin functions.\n\nHowever, it should be highlighted that the conflict\u2019s financial effects are unknown for the foreseeable future. The length, cost, and potential means of funding the war could have an impact on cryptocurrency markets as well as other international financial markets.\n\nOne of the first reactions came from the crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe, who expects the market to be volatile this week. He asserted that it is likely that Bitcoin will continue to rise, possibly reaching $30,000 as global uncertainty grows.\n\nI\u2019ve had an amazing business trip to Dubai. Can\u2019t wait to share news! Now; market perspective it\u2019s going to be a volatile week. My idea is that #Bitcoin continues the upwards grind & potentially reaches $30K as worldwide uncertainty grows. Stop the war. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) October 7, 2023\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics company Santiment , there has been a big shift in the Bitcoin market as over 10,000 $BTC have left exchanges, the greatest amount since September 7.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin is trying to reach the $28,000 market value. The significance of utility cannot be understated, particularly in light of the recent decline in unique addresses.\n\n\ud83d\udcca #Bitcoin had its most coins (over 10K $BTC ) moving off exchanges since September 7th, and #crypto 's top market cap asset is making a 2nd run at crossing a $28K market value. Utility will be important here, as unique addresses have fallen to 6-week lows. https://t.co/JoJv9YYJsA pic.twitter.com/3JELGuzJRG \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 8, 2023\n\nWar and Commodities Reemerging On the Crypto Radar\n\nBitcoin\u2019s reaction might vary if the incident continues for a long time and costs the people concerned a lot of money. To pay for expenses, governments might resort to borrowing money or printing money, which could cause inflation and undermine trust in fiat currencies.\n\nIn such a case, interest in and investment in Bitcoin, sometimes touted as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, could surge. Bitcoin\u2019s price might rise because investors use it as a store of value to guard against currency depreciation and economic uncertainty.\n\nHowever, when it comes to price catalysts, traders in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets believe that the majority of volatility is still to come due to the ongoing Israel war.\n\nCrypto trader Jelle compared this situation with the start of the war in Ukraine by saying he was unsure of what would happen to BTC/USD after the war in Ukraine in February 2022 because of Bitcoin\u2019s response to that event.\n\nGetting quite a few questions about this; I don't know. All I do know is that the Ukraine war triggered an 8% down candle, that was erased within a day. I'm much more concerned with the unnecessary loss of life than by the potential effects on the market.#Bitcoin https://t.co/FPjD86HqYh pic.twitter.com/sCYBKU0npS \u2014 Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) October 9, 2023\n\nBitcoin, Gold and Oil\n\nIn the meantime, Mike McGlone, senior macro strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said traders are currently demonstrating a \u201crisk-off tilt\u201d towards Bitcoin.\n\n#Bitcoin showing risk off tilt in the aftermath of Hamas-Israel escalation. My bias is the downward sloping 100-week moving average is likely to win the battle vs. the up trending 50-week. Spiking #crudeoil is a liquidity pressure factor. @BBGIntelligence pic.twitter.com/UYDcqc03Z2 \u2014 Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) October 8, 2023\n\nMcGlone mentioned a macro asset phenomenon that was developing, with gold up 1% on the day and Brent crude up 3.25% ahead of the opening of Wall Street.\n\nIn a Pavlovian reaction to the conflict between Israel and Palestine, gold prices jumped. As investors hurried to invest in safe havens like gold, bonds, and US dollars, the yellow metal acquired luster.\n\nToday\u2019s session saw a rise in gold of around 1%. In challenging times like these, gold might be a beneficiary if it turns into a regional war with the involvement of other nations and any disruptions to the oil supply.\n\nPopular trader Skew described BTC price behavior as \u201cilliquid and choppy,\u201d adding that \u201cmarkets are reacting quite defensively,\u201d pointing to a fresh rise in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which was up 0.4% on its own.\n\n$BTC 4H\n\nthese wicks really say how illiquid & choppy price action is pic.twitter.com/Qq13GsuqfB \u2014 Skew \u0394 (@52kskew) October 9, 2023\n\nThe DXY index reached its highest levels last week since late 2022.\n\nRussia \u2013 Ukraine War Comparison\n\nDigital tools have substantially impacted the battle in Ukraine. It is one of the most extensively documented military operations in history and the first significant cyberwar between two nations. The war has also featured the widespread use of crypto.\n\nAccording to Elliptic , a blockchain analytics company, as the conflict enters its second year, more than $212 million worth of cryptocurrencies have been given to support pro-Ukrainian war operations. This includes the direct transfer to the Ukrainian government of almost $80 million in cryptocurrency.\n\nVarious war activities have reportedly been funded with cryptocurrency, according to Ukrainian officials and government fundraising websites. The products bought vary from helmets and protective vests to drones and demining tools. Other cryptocurrency donations have gone towards purchasing radios and medical supplies as well as infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, reports from Chainalysis show there were volunteer organizations and their followers who have used social media to crowdfund the procurement of weapons and disseminate misinformation by asking for cryptocurrency donations. The report has shown these groups have received over $2.2 million in cryptocurrencies, mostly in the form of Bitcoin and Ether donations. Tether, Litecoin, and Dogecoin have all been sent in sizable amounts as well."

        "content": "The connection between gold and bitcoin (BTC) as stores of value is obvious, and the demand for BTC as a digital store of value was a big reason why the cryptocurrency grew in popularity, crypto services provider Matrixport said in a report Monday.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market capitalization is $540 billion, equivalent to 10.8% of the market cap of physical financial gold, Matrixport said, adding that gold exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) are valued at $200 billion.\n\nThis is why potential approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF could result in inflows of $20 - $30 billion, potentially triggering a large rally in the cryptocurrency, the report said.\n\nThe SEC has dragged its heels on approving a spot bitcoin ETF, and in August said it was delaying its decision on all new applications until October. The crypto market is hopeful that such an approval will trigger a flood of mainstream money into the sector.\n\nStill, bitcoin has an edge over gold as the private keys can be memorized, which eliminates the risk of confiscation, the report said.\n\n\u201cEven today, storing assets in the form of gold has not only become unfashionable in the digital age, but comes with significant restrictions when crossing borders,\u201d wrote Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, adding that \u201cbitcoin offers a solution to this dilemma, enabling the swift and relatively inconspicuous movement of value across borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, considering the current state of technological developments, bitcoin\u2019s primary roles are likely as a store of value akin to gold and a speculative financial asset,\u201d the report added.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Price May Boom in October, Could Hit $37K by Year-End: Matrixport"

        "content": "Podcaster Joe Rogan expressed his optimism for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), highlighting its potential to become a \u201cuniversal viable currency.\u201d\n\nWhat Happened: In an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Friday, Rogan said that Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and decentralized mining process make it an intriguing candidate for broader adoption.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin. To me, that\u2019s the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. It\u2019s limited in the amount that there can be [and] people mine it with their own [computer]. That to me is very fascinating. I love the fact that it\u2019s been implemented.\u201d\n\nRogan invited Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI who also expressed his excitement about Bitcoin, stating, \u201cI think this idea that we have a global currency that is outside of the control of any government is a super logical and important step on the tech tree.\u201d\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash Slumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nA divergence appears to be building, at least in Monday's price action, between certain top cryptocurrencies and the broader equity market. While most risk assets declined in morning trading Monday in response to surging oil prices and an escalating conflict in the Middle East, equities recovered during the afternoon, with crypto assets underperforming.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, Ethereum (ETH -3.30%), Dogecoin (DOGE 4.38%), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH 0.13%) had declined 3.3%, 3.6%, and 5.1%, respectively, over the prior 24 hours.\n\nSo what\n\nEthereum's decline appeared to have been driven by more than just macroeconomic factors. News that the Ethereum Foundation (which supports development and innovation on the Ethereum blockchain) had swapped $2.7 million worth of Ethereum for stablecoin USDC (USDC 0.01%) on Monday sent the token lower. While swaps like this have been seen in the past, and are used by the Ethereum Foundation as a way to cover costs, sell-offs typically follow such transactions. This was the case once again on Monday.\n\nInterestingly, both Bitcoin Cash and Dogecoin appear to be increasingly seeing intraday moves that are more correlated with the overall market. Monday's outsized moves in both these tokens indicate investors may be viewing them as ways to play momentum in either direction in the crypto sector. In other words, Dogecoin's status as a meme token and Bitcoin Cash's status as a higher-volatility token could be viewed by traders as making them opportune ways to gain leverage to broader crypto market moves in the near term.\n\nNow what\n\nIt's rarely good news to see one of the most sophisticated developers in the crypto sector selling assets to cover its operating costs. And while that's not necessarily a novel concept for investors who follow Ethereum, the market's reaction to this sale speaks volumes about what I think could be a shifting narrative around the sustainability of this space.\n\nFor those looking at the crypto sector as a way to diversify their portfolios, investing in tokens tied to projects that continue to invest in themselves continues to be a good idea. In that regard, this move by the Ethereum Foundation may be viewed in a positive light by those who believe that most of the innovation in this sector continues to come from this blockchain.\n\nFor traders and speculators looking to play the broader moves in this sector (driven by Ethereum and Bitcoin, primarily), altcoins and higher-leverage tokens will always be around to trade. That said, if I had to pick one of these tokens to buy on Monday's decline, it would have to be Ethereum. That's partly because of the aforementioned continued reinvestment into the network's technology, as well as the fact that Ethereum has typically headed higher again in the wake of previous Ethereum Foundation sales."

        "content": "Bitcoin inscriptions, a new way to store data on the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) blockchain, have surpassed 35 million since their inception in January.\n\nOrdinals are digital artifacts that can be inscribed onto Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol.\n\nThey can be anything from text files, images, and audio to videos, and can be used to store a wide variety of data on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to a report by Galaxy Digital, text files represent the vast majority of Bitcoin inscriptions, accounting for approximately 95% of all inscriptions.\n\nAlso Read: People Are Going To Start Cashing Out Bitcoin \u2014 Here's Why\n\nImage-based inscriptions account for approximately 3.5% of all inscriptions, with the remaining 1.5% consisting of other types of digital artifacts.\n\nOrdinals Activity Since March: In the first 200 days since the first inscription on Bitcoin, a total of 1.14 million image-based inscriptions have been created.\n\nThis surpasses the number of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) minted on other blockchains, such as Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC), since the debut of NFTs on these respective networks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Bitcoin's minting activity throughout the first 200 days is still much lower than the total minting activity for NFTs on other blockchains, illustrating how Ordinals still have a long way to go in terms of adoption relative to the broader NFT ecosystem.\n\nOrdinals Trading Volume: Despite the unfavorable market conditions for NFTs in 2023, Ordinals accomplished meaningful growth.\n\nBitcoin has accumulated the third-highest NFT trading volume by the network at $596.4 million.\n\nEven when excluding BRC-20s, which represent ~30% of all Ordinals volume ($187.5 million), Bitcoin remains the third most popular chain for digital collectible activity after Ethereum and Solana.\n\nOrdinals Marketplaces: The most dominant marketplaces by volume for Ordinals are now Magic Eden, Unisat, and OKX at 28%, 28%, and 38% respectively.\n\nImplications for the Future of Bitcoin: The growing popularity of Bitcoin inscriptions is a significant development for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIt suggests that Bitcoin is being used for more than just a store of value and a medium of exchange. It is also being used to store and share data, which could lead to new and innovative use cases for Bitcoin in the future.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin inscriptions could be used to create a decentralized social media platform or a decentralized storage platform. They could also be used to create new forms of digital art and collectibles.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin To $20K, Ethereum To $1K?

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Mining Stocks Like Marathon, Cleanspark, and Riot Crashed Last Month - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nShares of many Bitcoin (BTC -2.54%) mining stocks crashed hard in September 2023, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.91%) lost 17.8%, Cleanspark (CLSK -9.41%) stock fell 22.7%, and Marathon Digital's (MARA -8.71%) shares dropped 33.4%.\n\nThese sudden price drops are not unheard of in this volatile market sector, but they are usually caused by a large price drop in Bitcoin. The largest cryptocurrency did trade lower last month, but only by 1.4%. So why did the crypto miners take such dramatic haircuts in a fairly quiet month for Bitcoin itself?\n\nSo what\n\nFirst and foremost, the crypto miners were soaring sky-high at the start of September. By the time the calendar page flipped, both Marathon and Riot had more than tripled their share prices year-to-date. The environment-focused Cleanspark trailed the larger miners, but was still up by 142% on Aug. 31.\n\nIt didn't take much of a Bitcoin correction to drive these stocks far lower. Gently pumping the brakes on Bitcoin's value growth was enough to trigger these significant drops.\n\nNow what\n\nThe crypto market had turned sour in 2022, started a sharp rebound in early 2023, and lost steam again in recent weeks. These swings are a close match for the bullish and bearish signs in the global economy, which can't seem to get out of its inflation doldrums after two years of price-control government policies.\n\nSo investors are unconvinced that high-risk investments will pay off in the long run, especially if the company behind each stock must take new loans at lofty interest rates to finance its operations.\n\nThis risk-averse attitude is bad news for Bitcoin and even worse for the crypto-mining experts. That's why Cleanspark, Riot, and Marathon tend to exaggerate Bitcoin's market moves, both on a day-to-day basis and in the long run.\n\nNow, the miners were not completely quiet last month.\n\nRiot produced 333 new Bitcoin tokens in August but also sold 300 to fund its operations. The company also explained how it lowered Bitcoin production during the heat wave in August, supplying 84,000 megawatts of sorely needed energy to the struggling Texas infrastructure in exchange for a $7 million payment.\n\nCleanspark generated 659 tokens and sold 43 for a net increase of 616 Bitcoins. Construction is now underway on a new Bitcoin mining facility in Georgia.\n\nMarathon mined 1,062 digital coins without selling any, and also issued 31.7 million new shares to cancel $417 million of its convertible notes debt.\n\nBitcoin mining companies may look similar to the uninitiated, but each one runs its mining process on distinctly different principles. Riot produces its own power and sells some in a separate revenue stream. Cleanspark bends over backward to ensure environmentally friendly mining operations, which may come in handy if the federal or state government imposes green energy requirements at some point. And Marathon's epic scale is hard to match, but it's also the only company in this trio that carries a significant debt balance.\n\nSo, if you want to invest in one of these amplified Bitcoin vehicles during a modest downturn, you could either do a deep dive and figure out which one's the best fit for your strategy, or grab a few shares of each to form a more diverse miner portfolio.\n\nBut remember, the potential for soaring gains comes with exposure to massive risks, too. September's sudden price drops served as a reminder of that fact -- in a steady Bitcoin environment, no less. Bitcoin mining stocks won't suit every investors' level of risk tolerance."

        "title": "Oman bets big on cryptocurrency mining despite Bitcoin's volatility - The Circuit",
        "content": "The oil-rich country is staking a share of its future on digital money. A cooler southern climate, business-friendly regulation and cheap energy could help it succeed\n\nFor the last two years, the market value of Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride, the volatility leading institutional investors and regulators to question the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nBut look to the Gulf countries and a different story is taking shape: the United Arab Emirates and Oman are looking seriously at regulating digital assets while crypto firms are flocking to Dubai to set up shop. Oman, for its part, is betting big on cryptocurrency mining. Observers say a cooler climate in Salalah, in the south, compared to elsewhere in the desert nation, as well as business-friendly regulation and cheap energy could help it succeed.\n\nIn August, the oil-rich country announced close to $800 million in investments in crypto-mining operations, including $300 million with Abu Dhabi-based Phoenix Group to develop a 150-megawatt crypto-mining farm with Green Data City, Oman\u2019s first licensed crypto-mining entity, slated to go online next year. Weeks earlier, Muscat approved a $370 million farm operated by Exahertz International.\n\nOman is looking to diversify beyond fossil fuel revenues under its \u201cVision 2040\u201d economic agenda, which focuses on the buildout of modern energy and telecommunication infrastructure that aims to attract foreign investment and create knowledge-worker jobs.\n\n\u201cCrypto might be uniquely suited to Oman\u2019s policy style to diversify its trading partners and sources of non-hydrocarbon income,\u201d Sam Blatteis, CEO and co-founder of the MENA Catalysts, a government relations firm for tech companies, told The Circuit.\n\nOver the last decade, crypto mining has gone from a basement-type operation distributed over individual computers to large centralized mining pools that require large capital investment and sophisticated machines to solve ever-harder-to-attain matches to cryptographic solutions.\n\nThis is energy-intensive work.\n\nOman offers some of the cheapest electricity in the world, costing only around 5 cents per kilowatt hour, compared to 23 cents in the U.S. This significantly lowers the operational costs for crypto mining. A medium-sized crypto-mining operation in Oman could save millions of dollars in electricity costs compared to operating in the U.S., which is home to over a third of all crypto mining globally.\n\nThe move will not be without controversy as crypto mining is often derided for not being environmentally friendly. Bitcoin mining generates 21 to 53 million tons of carbon per year, according to an analysis by Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nSheikh Mansour Bin Taleb Bin Ali Al Hinai, chairman of Oman\u2019s Authority for Public Services Regulations, commented in a press statement about his government\u2019s support of Bitcoin mining facilities: \u201cThis initiative aligns with our goal to diversify our economy, integrating modern technologies while upholding our commitment to ethical and sustainable practices.\u201d\n\nThe country is aiming for at least a third of energy production to be from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nBut energy isn\u2019t the only focus. Stability matters, too, according to those who have chosen to do business in Oman.\n\n\u201cIn previous years, the mining industry was only focused on finding the lowest prices of electricity, and this led to disasters in unstable countries like China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Paraguay,\u201d Olivier Ohnheiser, CEO of Green Data City in Muscat, told The Circuit.\n\n\u201cEven the U.S. is threatening the mining industry with taxes and higher electricity prices in the next few years. So, now, with the consolidation of the industry under publicly listed mega-miners, the priority is stability. Most miners prefer to have 50% of their operations as a maximum in the U.S., and 50% diversified elsewhere. Oman is one of the best places, if not the best place, for that.\n\n\u201cOman offers long-term stability and fixed prices of electricity in the long run,\u201d Ohnheiser continued. \u201cThe country is stable and is known to respect its commitments.\u201d\n\nJad Kharma, CEO of Exahertz, the other crypto mining operator with an Omani license, agrees.\n\n\u201cThis is Switzerland of the Middle East,\u201d he said of government stability. \u201cI felt safer as a foreign investor to put my hands in the hands of the people that are shaping the future for the country\u201d than in other countries in the region.\n\nPlus, Kharma likes the quality of life in Salalah, the microclimate in southern Oman where the crypto mining takes place. It\u2019s often many degrees cooler than elsewhere in the Arabian Gulf: an actual oasis.\n\nThe oasis has Jaran Mellerud\u2019s attention. An associate at Luxor, a Seattle -based company that develops crypto-mining technologies, he traveled to the UAE and Oman over the summer to check out the mining operations underway and evaluate if either country has the potential to take up significant market share in the near future.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is a very simple way of monetizing excess electricity,\u201d he told The Circuit. \u201cIf there is a place that has a lot of excess electricity, but has no other way of quickly putting it to use, Bitcoin mining is a very efficient way of attracting investment into that area, for example in southern Oman, with all this excess electricity.\u201d\n\nOman has the advantage in the region for other reasons other than an excess of cheap energy. Solid government support and a relatively cooler climate are other main drivers.\n\n\u201cThe only way to mine Bitcoin in a scalable and legally sustainable way in Oman is by closely cooperating with the government. Miners need licenses and are also expected to provide significant benefits to the community. In return, they get tax benefits and access to loads of competitively priced electricity.\u201d\n\nMellerud predicts that Oman will become an increasingly important destination for Bitcoin over the next couple of years and could, together with the UAE, take the Middle East\u2019s total share of the Bitcoin mining network to above 15%."

        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) appears to have largely decoupled from traditional equities, as evidenced by its price trajectory no longer mirroring that of major indices such as the S&P 500.\n\nThis divergence is particularly noteworthy given the S&P 500's recent bounce off the 4200 points level, while Bitcoin had already reached the bottom of its current range, according to a Bitfinex report.\n\nThis phenomenon underscores the evolving dynamics between traditional financial markets and the cryptocurrency sector. Such developments and their implications for investors and traders will be a focal point of discussion at the upcoming Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 14.\n\nThe correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 reached its zenith on Aug. 25, with a value of 0.8. Since then, the correlation has been on a decline, with Bitcoin exhibiting slower upward movement compared to equities and more pronounced downturns throughout September.\n\nCurrently, the correlation value stands at -0.5, indicating that the two are moving in opposite directions.\n\nSuch decorrelation is typically observed when there's a sudden bullish or bearish development in either asset class, or when one market prices in information more rapidly than the other.\n\nThe S&P 500, for instance, closed above the pivotal 4300 level on Oct. 6, marking its second-largest daily increase since June 15 this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the dominance of stablecoins in the crypto market has seen a slight dip, now accounting for 11-11.4% of the total crypto market cap.\n\nBitcoin's volatility has also made a significant entrance this October.\n\n\"As of now, the Implied volatility to Historical volatility ratio is 1.16, which, though a decrease from last week, still signifies that the market expects greater volatility. It's noteworthy that while the disparity between these metrics has narrowed, both measures have simultaneously risen on an absolute basis, indicating that expectations of future volatility are aligned with recent historical data but at a higher level than before,\" the Bitfinex analysts told Benzinga.\n\nAlso Read: Komainu Gets Approval For UK Crypto Register: Crypto Custody Goes Mainstream\n\nHistorical data shows a 24-hour volatility surge of over 340% on Oct. 2, with predictions suggesting that this trend will continue for the remainder of the month.\n\nSince October's onset, Bitcoin's volatility has surpassed its average for the past 200 days.\n\nHistorically, volatility in the U.S. stock market precedes similar trends in other risk assets, including Bitcoin.\n\nThe VIX, which measures the S&P 500's volatility, hit its lowest point in three and a half years on Sept. 15, 2023, but has since rebounded past the crucial 18 level.\n\nIn terms of Bitcoin holdings, short-term holders (STH) \u2014 those who've held BTC for less than 155 days \u2014 have offloaded approximately 1 million BTC since April 13, 2023.\n\nA significant portion of this, 200,000 BTC, was sold between Sep. 25 and 26.\n\nOn the broader economic front, the U.S. presents a mixed bag.\n\nWhile the housing market is under pressure with declining mortgage applications and pending home sales, the manufacturing sector is showing signs of recovery.\n\nThe Purchasing Managers manufacturing sub-index recently reported its first expansion in almost a year.\n\nHowever, the U.S. job market's foundation appears shaky, despite an uptick in job openings and employment growth.\n\nRead Next: Hacker Steals Then Returns Funds For Reward To Huobi's HTX: 'You Made The Right Choice'\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) scraped the bottom of the barrel in the third quarter of the year, registering a loss of 11.1% for investors, barely beating long-term treasuries, which netted -11.9% over the same timeframe.\n\nGreg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at Bitcoin firm NYDIG, wrote about the crypto\u2019s poor performance and how it defies recent events in the crypto space.\n\nCipolaro pointed to favorable court cases, macroeconomic changes, the recent \u201cquagmire\u201d over government funding, the debate on U.S. debt, and the \u201congoing efforts to secure approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF,\u201d highlighting how none of these developments managed to push Bitcoin past the upper bound of its current range\u2013which he said sits at $31,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin, however, wasn\u2019t the only asset to register losses last quarter. In fact, almost every asset class\u2014including gold and other precious metals, the U.S. stock market, and real estate\u2014suffered important percentage drops.\n\nNotably, only four assets celebrated wins in the quarter, with commodities gaining 15.5%, seconded by cash at 1.3%.\n\nEconomist for the Heritage Foundation, Peter St. Onge, said a momentary pause in rising prices might be behind Bitcoin\u2019s meager performance. \u201cI think the main driver near-term has been inflation looking more sedate,\u201d he told Decrypt, adding that gold also feels these effects.\n\nThis trend might not be long-lived, however. St. Onge pointed out that recent events in Israel might trigger price action in financial assets. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens in the Middle East,\u201d he said, explaining that \u201chard assets tend to shore up, but risk assets go down.\u201d\n\nFor him, \u201cBitcoin is a bit of both.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSt. Onge\u2019s views differ from those of NYDIG\u2019s global head of research.\n\nCipolaro sees \u201cpersistently\u201d high inflation, rising interest rates, \u201crecession worries,\u201d and seasonality weighed on returns, highlighting that Bitcoin tends to showcase dismal performances in the third quarter of every year. Perhaps in an effort to give investors hope, however, he wrote that the \u201clackluster performance\u201d has a silver lining: the fourth quarter is historically one of the asset\u2019s best quarters.\n\nIn spite of its most recent quarterly performance, Bitcoin investors will have to wait and see if the top cryptocurrency recovers its early 2023 trend, which has seen the asset on fire. Bitcoin has gained 63% on the year, only one of four to register double-digit gains, and is eclipsing its closest contender, U.S. Large Cap Growth Funds by more than double."

        "title": "US debt in one day: more than half of bitcoin's market capitalisation - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In a financial development of staggering proportions, the US has added a staggering $275 billion to its national debt in just 24 hours, more than half the market capitalisation of bitcoin.\n\nThe total value now stands at an all-time high of $33.44 trillion. This exponential increase has caused concern and reflection on the nation\u2019s fiscal path.\n\nAlarming surge: US adds more than half the market value of bitcoin to its debt in a single day\n\nIn a staggering turn of events, the US added a colossal $275 billion to its national debt in a single day, catapulting the nation\u2019s total debt to an unprecedented $33.44 trillion.\n\nTo put things in perspective, this astronomical daily increase in US debt was more than half of the entire market capitalisation of bitcoin, a sum equivalent to around 10 million BTC.\n\nThis remarkable development underlines the continuing expansion of the US debt mountain, with billions of dollars being added to it every day.\n\nAstonishingly, this daily accumulation of debt exceeds the total market capitalisation of most cryptocurrencies. In this article we look at the implications and ramifications of this fiscal phenomenon.\n\nUS debt: half of bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation in debt\n\nOn 4 October, renowned Bitcoin pioneer Samson Mow astutely compared the monumental increase in US debt to the market capitalisation of bitcoin.\n\nThe result was astonishing to say the least: the increase in debt exceeded half of bitcoin\u2019s market capitalisation of around $267 billion.\n\nTo put this figure into perspective, it is equivalent to around 10 million BTCs, a staggering sum that makes one ponder the relative value of $27,000 as a potential purchase price.\n\nFurthermore, the increase in debt has surpassed the entire market capitalisation of Ethereum, which currently stands at just under $200 billion.\n\nIn essence, this daily debt escalation represents a quarter of the total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies, which is seamlessly integrated into the burgeoning national debt.\n\nNotably, this surge in US debt came just two weeks after the $33 trillion threshold was crossed, reflecting the exponential growth of US financial obligations.\n\nTo provide further context, this means that the US is adding $32 billion of debt every day, a pace that could potentially result in $1 trillion of debt maturing in a single month. This is double the previous rate of $14 billion per day.\n\nRising US debt servicing costs\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts have predicted that the cost of servicing the US\u2019s colossal debt load will hit a new record by 2025.\n\nThe rise in borrowing costs over the past year, largely due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, has put upward pressure on the cost of managing the gigantic national debt.\n\nIn 2022 alone, the US government will spend as much as $476 billion, or about 2% of national GDP, on servicing interest on the debt. However, interest payments are projected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2024, with an alarming projection of 4% of GDP by 2030.\n\nThe Peter G. Peterson Foundation has estimated that the US will have to spend the colossal sum of $10.6 trillion on interest payments on the national debt over the next decade.\n\nIn addition, other estimates have predicted an accelerated rate of growth in the debt-to-GDP ratio. According to a projection by the Congressional Budget Office, the federal debt could reach a staggering 181% of national GDP by 2053.\n\nDebt ceiling unlimited until 2025\n\nFinally, it is important to note that the debt ceiling, which limits the amount of debt the US can accumulate, will remain suspended until January 2025.\n\nAs a result, the staggering numbers associated with this surge in US debt will become the new normal, raising critical questions about the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal sustainability.\n\nThe dramatic rise in US debt, which in a single day exceeded half the market capitalisation of bitcoin, is a financial phenomenon that demands attention and scrutiny.\n\nThe implications of this continued fiscal expansion go far beyond the cryptocurrency space and have profound implications for the US economy, interest rates and the country\u2019s long-term financial stability.\n\nAs the United States continues to accumulate debt at an unprecedented rate, policymakers, economists and investors must grapple with the complex challenges and uncertainties this poses for the nation\u2019s fiscal future."
