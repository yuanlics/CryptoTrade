        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nGold investing could be a smart alternative to buying Bitcoin in today's crypto market, and there are a few good reasons why. Getty Images\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, has been an alluring investment option in recent years thanks to its growing value and position as a trusted crypto asset. However, Bitcoin's pricing \u2014 and the wider crypto market \u2014 has experienced extreme volatility over the last year, with periods of pricing declines and upticks that have been hard to predict.\n\nAnd, the crypto asset experienced yet another significant correction this week when the price of Bitcoin dropped to $40,000 \u2014 a decline of approximately 12% and the lowest price point since December 18, 2023. This price drop occurred shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to commence trading on January 10.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was a move that had initially been expected to bolster the cryptocurrency's value \u2014 but instead triggered a correction that sent shockwaves through the market. And, that plunge in Bitcoin's price has left investors grappling with uncertainties. In turn, some investors may be reevaluating their strategies, considering alternative assets \u2014 like gold \u2014 that may provide a more stable haven instead. But is gold actually a good alternative to Bitcoin? Let's find out.\n\nReady to get started? Find your top gold investing options here.\n\nBitcoin is falling. Should you invest in gold now?\n\nWith the price of Bitcoin falling, it could make sense to consider investing in gold instead \u2014 and there are a few good reasons why, including:\n\nThe historic stability of gold\n\nGold has long been considered a safe-haven asset, meaning that it can help to protect your wealth during periods of market or economic turbulence. And, unlike Bitcoin, which is a relatively new entrant in the financial landscape, gold has historically weathered a number of economic storms.\n\nThat's a large part of why investors have traditionally turned to gold during times of crisis. They view it as a store of value that retains its worth even in the face of market fluctuations. And, with the price of Bitcoin fluctuating right now, it may be a good time to consider adding gold to your portfolio to help offset some of the potential losses from your crypto investments.\n\nLearn more about how you can invest in gold today.\n\nThe inverse relationship with equities\n\nGold has long exhibited an inverse relationship with traditional equities, often acting as a counterbalance to stock market movements. When stocks experience volatility or decline, gold has historically seen increased demand by investors.\n\nThis inverse correlation can be an attractive feature for investors seeking diversification in their portfolios, especially during times when the broader market is facing challenges. And, if your portfolio includes a large amount of Bitcoin, this could be the right time to take advantage of gold's ability to move inversely to Bitcoin and many other investment assets.\n\nGold's ability to hedge inflation\n\nWhile the inflation rate has been tempered compared to what it was this time last year, the most recent inflation report showed that we may not be done just yet. Inflation ticked back up unexpectedly in December and is still hovering above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2% and it's unclear what may happen in the future.\n\nBut while the timeline for resolving the inflation issues may be up in the air, what's clear is that gold has historically proven to be an effective hedge against rising prices due to inflation. The precious metal has historically maintained its purchasing power amid high inflation, making it an attractive option for investors who are concerned about the eroding effects of inflation on their portfolios.\n\nThe tangible asset appeal\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which exists purely in digital form, gold is a tangible asset with intrinsic value. Physical gold, whether in the form of gold bullion \u2014 like gold bars and coins \u2014 or jewelry, provides investors with a tangible asset they can hold. This tangible appeal can offer a sense of security and ownership that digital assets, like crypto, may lack.\n\nThe global economic uncertainty\n\nThe ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties that are occurring across the globe can also contribute to increased demand for gold. In times of crisis or uncertainty, investors often flock to assets perceived as safer, and gold tends to be a primary beneficiary of such sentiment. So, given the current geopolitical climate, it could be a smart time to invest in gold \u2014 especially as Bitcoin's value drops.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAs Bitcoin faces a period of correction following the SEC's approval of ETFs, investors may find themselves at a crossroads, evaluating the resilience of their portfolios. While cryptocurrencies offer unique opportunities to investors, the recent market downturn also prompts a reconsideration of traditional safe-haven assets. And gold, with its historical stability, inverse relationship with equities, inflation-hedging qualities, tangible appeal and ability to thrive in times of global economic uncertainty, emerges as a compelling option.\n\nThat said, investors who are interested in gold investing should carefully assess their risk tolerance, investment goals and overall portfolio diversification strategy before making any decisions. While Bitcoin and gold represent distinct asset classes with different risk profiles, the current market conditions emphasize the importance of a well-balanced and diversified investment approach. And, in times of uncertainty, having a mix of assets that respond differently to market dynamics can help safeguard investors against the inherent volatility of financial markets."

        "content": "Exchange-traded funds come in many shapes and sizes. Some are plain vanilla, diversified index funds that let you invest in the entire stock and bond markets, and are excellent core holdings for the great majority of people.\n\nThen there are the quirky, narrowly focused E.T.F.s like the Inverse Cramer Tracker, which enables you to bet against the stock picks of the CNBC television host Jim Cramer. The fund is legal, approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and a money-loser since its inception last year. Betting against Jim Cramer just isn\u2019t a great investing strategy.\n\nNeither is fear of missing out. Yet FOMO is the main reason for putting money into Bitcoin, which remains highly speculative, difficult to categorize and without an immediately identifiable economic function.\n\nThe S.E.C. this month approved 11 new E.T.F.s that track the price of Bitcoin, and the decision has been heralded by promoters of Bitcoin \u2014 and of the new funds \u2014 as an important event, legitimizing Bitcoin as an asset class."

        "content": "In 2017, legendary investor Jack Bogle famously warned people to \u201cavoid Bitcoin like the plague.\u201d More than six years later, Vanguard Group Inc. is still stoking the crypto world\u2019s ire by sticking to the conservative investing approach of its late founder.\n\nAmid the euphoria unleashed by the long-awaited debut of the first fully fledged Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US, Vanguard sparked uproar last week with its pointed decision to refuse to offer the new ETFs on its gigantic trading platform.\n\n#BoycottVanguard started trending on X, accumulating thousands of posts, with users pledging to pull their money from the asset management giant.\n\nVanguard\u2019s response? To double down. The firm, which controls $8.6 trillion, has not only snubbed Bitcoin-spot products, it\u2019s yanked futures-backed Bitcoin funds from its platform, too. That means it now offers no crypto products whatsoever, unlike its peers.\n\nThe saga speaks to Vanguard\u2019s deeply entrenched investing philosophy, one that hearkens back to Bogle himself. The Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based firm was founded by the money management icon in 1975 on a bedrock of investing in stocks and bonds \u2014 assets that generate cash flow, dividends and interest payments \u2014 while eschewing commodities.\n\nVanguard has traditionally steered clear of the latter \u2014 seen lacking intrinsic value and an internal rate of return \u2014 with Bogle dismissing commodity investing as \u201ctotal speculation.\u201d Modern-day Vanguard still follows that gospel closely nearly a half-century later, with just one commodity fund out of more than 400 offered worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising whatsoever that Vanguard has taken this stance given that there\u2019s ample precedent for it and more fundamentally, it\u2019s in alignment with their long-held investment principles,\u201d said Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar Inc.\n\nThat discipline extends beyond Vanguard\u2019s own lineup of mutual funds and ETFs and into its brokerage arm as well. While commodity ETFs are available to trade, the company pulled \u201cvery speculative and highly complex\u201d leveraged and inverse products from its platform in 2019.\n\nEven as billions roll into the newly-launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard has no plans to offer any crypto-related products, a spokesperson said.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Need Gatekeepers\u2019\n\nVanguard\u2019s rejection of crypto stands in stark contrast to its industry peers. BlackRock Inc., Fidelity and Invesco Ltd. all launched spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, while centuries-old State Street is providing fund servicing to several of the products.\n\nMeanwhile, Franklin Templeton has gone all-in on marketing its Bitcoin fund, putting laser-eyes on its X avatar of Benjamin Franklin and advocating for investors to add Bitcoin to 60/40 portfolios.\n\nTraditional finance\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin ETFs has only fueled online vitriol against Vanguard.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need gatekeepers to tell us how to invest,\u201d reads one X post with more than 2,600 likes. \u201cI\u2019ll go where me and my money are treated best,\u201d reads another with a screenshot of a Vanguard plan distribution request.\n\nStill, it\u2019s highly unlikely the #BoycottVanguard movement will even make a dent in the company\u2019s business, according to industry expert Dave Nadig.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t lose a single 401k plan over it, and an infinitesimally small number of brokerage clients,\u201d Nadig said.\n\nMeanwhile, cash continues to pour into Vanguard\u2019s lineup. Roughly $4.4 billion has been added to Vanguard\u2019s stable of 84 ETFs in the past week alone, after luring $157 billion in 2023, Bloomberg data show, more than any other asset manager. Vanguard has grown its share of the $8 trillion ETF market for 21 consecutive years, putting it on the cusp of dethroning industry leader BlackRock.\n\nDespite drawing the crypto community\u2019s disdain, Vanguard \u2014 with its rock-bottom fees and unique corporate structure in which fund investors elect its board members and effectively own the company \u2014 has still attracted something of a cult following online. On forum Bogleheads.org, any posts related to \u201cinvestment strategies based on securities or physical assets that have no underlying value or negative expected long term returns\u201d (hint: crypto) are banned.\n\nWhile shunning crypto ETFs could be a long-term risk should it ultimately put off younger investors, it\u2019s a small one relative to Vanguard\u2019s loyal base, according to Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, Vanguard can\u2019t keep money from coming in,\u201d said Balchunas, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s senior ETF analyst and the author of The Bogle Effect. \u201cEven if Vanguard said, \u2018Please stop investing with us,\u2019 it wouldn\u2019t do anything. They have banked so much trust and goodwill with their customers.\u201d"

        "title": "1 Surprising Crypto Stock to Buy Before It Soars 100% - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Right now, crypto investors are laser focused on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). That's fair enough. The recent approval of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs has made Bitcoin even more popular than it already was.\n\nBut if you expand your focus, there are several stocks that stand to benefit from any future gains in Bitcoin. The one that's on my radar right now is MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR). That might sound strange, given that MicroStrategy is an enterprise software company. But if you look under the hood, you'll see why this stock could skyrocket 100% or more this year.\n\nMicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy stock\n\nThe first thing you need to know about MicroStrategy is that it holds a lot of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. And I mean a lot. After a recent buying spree at the end of 2023, MicroStrategy now holds 189,150 Bitcoins. That ranks first among all publicly traded companies, and it's not even close. At Bitcoin's current price of $42,500, those holdings are valued at approximately $8 billion.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIf you compare the company's overall market cap ($6.5 billion) to the value of its Bitcoin, then it becomes immediately obvious just how leveraged MicroStrategy is to the price of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin holdings are worth more than the company itself! In fact, some investors refer to MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy stock because, for the past year, the stock has essentially been just a way to get access to Bitcoin without actually buying Bitcoin. As a result, over the past 12 months, MicroStrategy is up more than 100%.\n\nBitcoin proxy stock or Bitcoin ETF?\n\nBut there's just one problem. The approval of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024 has completely shifted the narrative. The very same investors who once used MicroStrategy as a proxy stock can now invest in Bitcoin ETFs instead. Theoretically, these Bitcoin ETFs will do a much better job of tracking the price of Bitcoin. And, thus, they could eventually make MicroStrategy less appealing to investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs evidence of this, the price of MicroStrategy fell by 20% in just the first 48 hours after Bitcoin ETF approval. For the year, MicroStrategy is down 30%. On top of all that, former MicroStrategy CEO (and current executive chairman) Michael Saylor says that he is planning to sell off 315,000 shares in the company worth over $200 million between now and April. So that should put downward pressure on the price of MicroStrategy as well.\n\nWill Bitcoin go to $100,000?\n\nBut there might be two very good reasons to buy the dip on MicroStrategy. For one, investors appear to be ignoring completely the fact that MicroStrategy is actually an enterprise software company. As noted above, they are ascribing zero value to the company's core business operations (which includes artificial intelligence- and business intelligence-related software solutions), and instead simply valuing MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy. So that's one additional source of value for MicroStrategy.\n\nMoreover, there's the future price of Bitcoin to consider. The Bitcoin ETF is just the first catalyst for Bitcoin this year. The second major catalyst -- the upcoming halving event -- is arriving in April. In three previous halving cycles, the price of Bitcoin has exploded, so investors are expecting the same to happen this year as well. That partially explains why Saylor plans to sell off all those company shares by April: He needs the money to invest in more Bitcoin before it goes completely parabolic.\n\nAdmittedly, this is a very risky strategy, but it's so bold it just might work. According to a growing number of influential voices on Wall Street, the price of Bitcoin could top $100,000 by the end of the year. Thus, by extension, the value of all that Bitcoin on the balance sheet of MicroStrategy should also double. And that means the market cap of MicroStrategy should also double.\n\nBefore you buy MicroStrategy\n\nJust keep in mind that investors have a number of different ways to get access to Bitcoin. They can buy it directly, via a cryptocurrency exchange such as Coinbase Global. They can buy it indirectly via a futures-based Bitcoin ETF. They can buy it indirectly via a spot Bitcoin ETF. And, finally, they can buy it indirectly via an investment in a Bitcoin proxy stock such as MicroStrategy.\n\nYour risk-reward profile will likely determine which strategy makes the most sense for your portfolio. For example, investment giant Vanguard Group has said that it would not be offering the new Bitcoin ETFs to its customers. Instead, (drum roll, please) it will be loading up on MicroStrategy.\n\nFor me, that's a pretty convincing argument that Bitcoin proxy stocks such as MicroStrategy will continue to perform well in 2024. You get indirect access to Bitcoin, plus the additional value from the underlying operations of the company. There is likely to be quite a bit of volatility along the way, so just be sure to buckle up if you plan on adding to your MicroStrategy position this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and MicroStrategy wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Fidelity Investments joined several different firms in receiving approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) from the SEC this week. The approval has been years in the making and is a milestone decision from the SEC. The launch augurs a new era for crypto accessibility for investors. Fidelity Investments\u2019 FBTC, the Fidelity\u00ae Wise Origin\u00ae Bitcoin fund, stands out as one of the first available options. The firm was one of the first to file a spot bitcoin application in 2021.\n\nSee more: How Fidelity Investments\u2019 Factor ETFs Seek to Outperform Peers\n\nThe spot bitcoin ETP looks to track the performance of bitcoin. Financial advisors and individual investors alike can find the strategy on Fidelity\u2019s various online platforms, priced at 25 basis points. The fee will not apply until August 1, 2024, which sets it apart from some of its rivals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve long believed a spot-priced exchange traded product would be an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin,\u201d said Cynthia Lo Bessette, Head of Digital Asset Management at Fidelity Investments.\n\n\u201cWith more than a decade of engagement and experience honing our expertise in the digital assets space and building an institutional-grade custody platform, Fidelity delivers a deep understanding of the digital assets ecosystem. It is in a unique position as a long-term leader in the financial services and the emerging crypto landscape,\u201d added Lo Bessette.\u201d\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETP FBTC\u2019s Approach\n\nThe strategy appears on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with a goal of tracking the performance of bitcoin as measured by the performance of the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate, per its prospectus. The ETP\u2019s index uses bitcoin price feeds from eligible bitcoin spot markets and a volume-weighted median price methodology calculated every 15 seconds.\n\nThe new era in bitcoin investing presents a notable opportunity for investors who\u2019ve wanted easier access to the cryptocurrency. For those investors looking to add exposure, the Fidelity\u00ae Wise Origin\u00ae Bitcoin Fund might be one option to consider.\n\nFor more news, information, and strategy, visit the ETF Investing Channel.\n\nDisclosure Information\n\nThis product is for investors with a high risk tolerance. It invests in a single asset, bitcoin, which is highly volatile and can become illiquid at any time.\n\nBitcoin is created, issued, transmitted, and stored according to protocols run by computers in the Bitcoin network. It is possible the Bitcoin protocol has undiscovered flaws that could result in the loss of some or all assets held by the Fund. There may also be network-scale attacks against the Bitcoin protocol, which result in the loss of some or all of assets held by the Fund. Advancements in quantum computing could break Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic rules. The Fund makes no guarantees about the reliability of the cryptography used to create, issue, or transmit Bitcoin held by the Fund. Bitcoin exchanges may suffer from operational issues, such as delayed execution, that could have an adverse effect on the Fund. Digital asset exchanges have been closed due to fraud, failure or security breaches. Any of the Fund\u2019s assets that reside on an exchange that shuts down or suffers a breach may be lost.\n\nFBTC is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the \u201cCEA\u201d). As a result, shareholders of FBTC do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.\n\nDigital assets are highly volatile, and their market movements are very difficult to predict. Various market forces may impact their value. That includes but is not limited to supply and demand, investors\u2019 faith and their willingness to purchase it using traditional currencies, investors\u2019 expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates, an evolving legislative and regulatory environment in the U.S. and abroad, and other economic trends. Investors also face other risks, including significant and negative price swings, flash crashes, and fraud and cyber- security risks. Digital assets may also be more susceptible to market manipulation than securities.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nThe performance of FBTC will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin. Investors in FBTC will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have. They will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.\n\nThe Fidelity\u00ae Wise Origin\u00ae Bitcoin Fund material must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus. Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund\u2019s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.\n\nFidelity Investments\u00ae is an independent company, unaffiliated with VettaFi.

And so now \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nWe\u2019re circling back.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Exactly. So I did see an innovation in crime prevention in my \u2014 near my house this week, which was, I went to get money out of the ATM, because my barber \u2014 I was going to get my haircut \u2014 only accepts cash.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s interesting. We might want to alert the authorities about that. Something\u2019s going on there.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo I went to an ATM and found out when I got there and put in my card and put in my PIN number that it was a cashless ATM. Have you heard of this?\n\ncasey newton\n\n(LAUGHING) Wait, what is a cashless ATM?\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) So I only learned this after I put in my card, but it was like, OK, well, we don\u2019t have cash in this ATM, so you can check your balance. You can make a transfer between accounts, or \u2014 or that\u2019s it, basically.\n\ncasey newton\n\n(LAUGHING) Wait, that\u2019s the most useless machine I\u2019ve ever heard of.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI know. I was like, at that point, why do you \u2014 like, what percentage of people who go to an ATM are doing things other than getting cash out?\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right. Because everything that you just described \u2014 you can just, like \u2014 I guarantee you that your bank has an app that does that. There does not need to be a machine in the physical world that does \u2014 the one thing that you need from the physical world is physical paper.\n\nkevin roose\n\nExactly. So this is an innovation, I would guess, like a crime prevention thing. Can\u2019t rob an ATM if there\u2019s no cash in it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt prevents crime, and it also just prevents customers from using it to do the only thing that they want to do.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I did \u2014 I was telling a friend about this, and they said, you know, it\u2019s sort of like a restaurant that has no food.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYou can come in. You can sit down. You can play with the forks.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThere\u2019s a scale. You can weigh yourself.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Go nuts. But if you want food, you\u2019re out of luck.\n\ncasey newton\n\nGo somewhere else. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nI\u2019m Kevin Roose, a tech columnist for \u201cThe New York Times.\u201d\n\ncasey newton\n\nI\u2019m Casey Newton from \u201cPlatformer.\u201d\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd this is \u201cHard Fork.\u201d\n\ncasey newton\n\nThis week, how OpenAI is working to prevent ChatGPT from disrupting global elections. Then, the times David Yaffe-Bellany joins to explain why Bitcoin is back, and finally, \u201cNew York Magazine\u201d John Herrman stops by to tell us how e-commerce took over TikTok and whether it can be stopped. I sure hope so. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nCasey, this week, OpenAI released a new blog post about how they are thinking about the 2024 elections. We have elections coming up, obviously, in this country, but also in many countries around the world. And OpenAI has been sort of \u2014 people have been asking questions about, will you allow your tools to be used in this or that way when it comes to elections. And this week, they sort of came out with this post saying, this is our stance on how AI can and should and shouldn\u2019t impact elections.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, and this has sort of become an interesting feature of modern life, where in the run-up to big global elections, tech platforms will come out and they\u2019ll say, hey, here\u2019s sort of the harms and abuses that we know can take place on our platforms, and here\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it in advance. Maybe here\u2019s some reminders about what\u2019s banned, and maybe here\u2019s some new things that we\u2019re going to do this year to stop the worst from happening.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. And there\u2019s also been a lot of fear, I would say, that this is going to be sort of the AI election, or the first election where these generative AI tools that allow people to manipulate images or create deepfakes or write very convincing political propaganda \u2014 they\u2019re going to be sort of freely available to lots and lots of people. And so there will just be \u2014 experts are worried a sort of flood or a deluge of AI-generated nonsense.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, so why don\u2019t you try to scare me a little bit, Kevin? Like, let\u2019s imagine we\u2019re living in a world where, god forbid, OpenAI had not released a blog post this week. What sort of harms and threats can you imagine in a situation where the platforms just weren\u2019t taking this seriously at all?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, I mean, you can imagine a world where there was just an unlimited or a nearly unlimited amount of manipulated media. So a photo of a person running for office, you know, appearing to accept a bribe from a local businessman in their district or something or meeting with a foreign leader. We\u2019ve seen already examples of these kinds of manipulated imagery. Ron DeSantis actually got a bit of heat recently for publicizing these images that had been created using AI, of Donald Trump hugging Dr. Fauci, which, for his audience, I imagine, is like the worst thing you could possibly imagine.\n\ncasey newton\n\nDisgusting.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo that\u2019s the sort of nightmare scenario that a lot of experts are envisioning, is this stuff just sort of goes mainstream. It becomes very, very easy. And things like running a troll farm to interfere with elections by just pumping out a bunch of manipulated text and images \u2014 that becomes trivially easy. You don\u2019t need hundreds of people in St. Petersburg working at your troll farm. Anyone with a ChatGPT subscription can basically spin one of these things up.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right. I just \u2014 I actually just laid off my entire team in St. Petersburg. I was like, what do I need you guys for?\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: We are already losing jobs to AI.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhat do you hear from people that you talk to about what they\u2019re worried about in AI in elections?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you, of everything I\u2019ve seen so far, the story that scares me most is the Slovakia case. Did you read about the Slovakia situation?\n\nkevin roose\n\nNo, I missed my Slovakia political news alert. What happened?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, it\u2019s a really fascinating story. Basically, in the run-up to the Slovakian election, last fall, the country had entered a kind of quiet period where the media is supposed to not cover the election anymore, right? The idea is, hey, let\u2019s take a few days off, let everybody just take a deep breath, make up your own minds without being manipulated. But in 2023, what it meant was that someone created this snippet of audio, which was later debunked as being generated by AI, and it apparently showed the progressive party candidate talking about buying votes from the country\u2019s Roma minority. The snippet got shared on social media, and a few days later, this guy lost the election. Now, of course, elections have many, many causes. We can\u2019t definitively say how much did this one piece of audio actually affect the election. But if you\u2019re somebody who\u2019s been worried about what generative AI means for elections and democracy, this is the bad scenario. Right? There is a world where a piece of fake media goes viral, no one can push back on it during the time that it matters, and all of a sudden, it might have had an effect on the outcome. So that\u2019s the sort of thing that I\u2019ve been keeping my eye on, and it was why I was frankly relieved to see OpenAI come out this week and say, OK, OK, we have a few ideas.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, and I think we should say, this is not just happening in Slovakia. We are already starting to see this kind of thing happen in the US. My colleague, Stuart Thompson, had a great story the other day about some of this sort of early warning signs that AI is being used in these malicious ways. And one of the examples that he wrote about was brought to light by a researcher named Daniel Siegel who found these people on 4chan who were watching these parole hearings. And then, they would go and do things like use AI to undress the female expert witnesses who were testifying at these parole hearings or make voice clones of judges in these parole hearings, like, saying offensive and racist things. And they would share these manipulated files on 4chan. And this doesn\u2019t appear to have been politically motivated. It was just a bunch of idiots, like, goofing around on 4chan. But imagine this kind of thing happens to someone who\u2019s running for city council in your town. That could be really hard to come back from.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, yeah. You know, it\u2019s not just political uses we\u2019re seeing this. If you\u2019ve scrolled through TikTok over the past few months, I imagine you\u2019ve probably seen some sort of deepfake celebrity who is trying to sell you crypto or run some other scam, right? So I think it\u2019s important to note just how quickly this is becoming normalized within the media environment of, OK, I\u2019m seeing a celebrity or I\u2019m hearing a politician\u2019s voice. How do I know what I think I know about that person?\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally. So OK, those are some of the ways that people are worried AI might impact politics and elections. So let\u2019s talk about this OpenAI post.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, so OpenAI said this week that it would prohibit users from building custom GPT for political campaigning and lobbying, for building chatbots that pretend to be real people like candidates or institutions, like a local government, and for deterring people from participating in democratic processes like voting.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo what did you \u2014 what did you make of these rules?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI think that, generally speaking, these are good rules. These are things that we have seen other platforms do, right? Like, other platforms will also not let you discourage folks from voting or post misinformation about how to vote. I think that\u2019s really good. But OpenAI does a couple of other things that I think could be particularly useful. For example, they say that they\u2019re going to be integrating more real-time news into people\u2019s use of ChatGPT. So if you\u2019re using ChatGPT in the morning, and maybe there\u2019s some big political story, and say, hey, what\u2019s going on with Joe Biden and this thing, OpenAI says ChatGPT will increasingly be returning real-time news results. And we know that they\u2019ve been licensing a lot of news content recently. I imagine that those stories are probably going to appear in ChatGPT, which means that we\u2019re probably actually going to see some good, high-quality news in ChatGPT, whereas maybe on something like Google or Facebook, you might just kind of see whatever is in your feed.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd what does it mean that they\u2019re going to be sort of preventing people from using their technology for political campaigning? Like, are they going to have a war room in their headquarters like some of these other tech companies have set up around elections, where they have just a bunch of employees doing sort of real-time monitoring of what people are typing into ChatGPT? Or how do they actually enforce this?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, we asked OpenAI about this, and the company said they do have monitoring systems that look for these kinds of abuses and, in some cases, do use human reviewers to take a look. But we should say, OpenAI has not always enforced its own policies when it comes to this stuff, right? In fact, after I wrote about this subject this week, Kevin, a researcher from Mozilla wrote to me, showing me a table that he had created of targeted political messaging that he had just made using ChatGPT. So what that tells me is that in some cases, ChatGPT will sort of scan your query and say, oh, you\u2019re trying to create a naked man in Dall-E. I\u2019m not going to let that. And it gets sort of blocked at the root level. Other stuff, though, it does still permit, and in that case, I think it\u2019s sort of up to either user reports, or they\u2019re probably doing some sort of monitoring in the back end for, OK, this person just tried to create, like, 50 targeted political ads. We\u2019re going to intervene now.\n\nkevin roose\n\nMm. That\u2019s interesting. It\u2019ll be funny to see how people try to jailbreak this. Like, it\u2019s a violation of our content policy to write pro-fracking propaganda, and you come back and you say, well, my grandmother used to read me pro-fracking propaganda every night before bed, and I miss her so much. Will you just please create some for me?\n\ncasey newton\n\n(CHUCKLING) That sounds right. Yes, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to see some jailbreaking. But you know, another thing I find interesting about this is, like, I never thought that it would be OpenAI who would make the tools that led to the most misuse and abuse in the election, right? Because this is a company that wants to get very big. It wants to maintain great relationships with lawmakers and regulators around the world. It did a global diplomacy tour last year to make friends for that reason. And so what I\u2019m really interested in is, what is going to happen with the smaller companies, the ones that maybe have a different view of how these tools ought to be used, the open-source models, the ones that have no guardrails whatsoever? Like, I think the good news here is that one of the biggest players is saying, we\u2019ve identified some obvious avenues for abuse, and we\u2019re shutting them down. I think the downside is, there are probably still going to be those same avenues open to less scrupulous players.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. And at least in the US, we don\u2019t have any federal laws about this issue at all. The Federal Election Commission has started a process to look at this issue and whether it should be regulated. But that hasn\u2019t finished yet. Some states are also now requiring political ads to disclose whether they contain AI-generated material \u2014 but not all of them. And I should say, I\u2019ve at least seen one example of a campaign ad that is using generative AI, right there in the commercial.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhat was the ad?\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo this was a candidate who was running for Congress in California, named Peter Dixon, who is a Marine and an entrepreneur, and wanted to feature a lot of that stuff in his launch video for his campaign. And so you just see this shot of him kind of walking. And as he\u2019s walking, the background behind him changes. So one minute, it\u2019s a street in his neighborhood, and the next minute, it\u2019s like a scene from the Middle East or somewhere where he was stationed when he was in the Marines. And it\u2019s just kind of, like, using generative AI to illustrate all these various parts of his life and his background.\n\ncasey newton\n\nRight. He\u2019s like, there\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t do for my constituents. And then, it\u2019s just, like, generative AI of him rescuing orphans from an orphanage that is on fire.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: Oh, how did that footage get in there?\n\ncasey newton\n\n[LAUGHS]: Yeah, no, that\u2019s just a \u2014 I mean, I think that sort of thing is fine, right? That\u2019s basically like an aesthetic choice. It\u2019s probably obvious to anybody who\u2019s watching that, that yeah, that is not just shot on an iPhone. Like, they\u2019re using some trickery to make that sort of thing happen. But again, when you think about other ways this could go, that same candidate might decide to do something really terrible involving their opponent with that same technology.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. Yeah, so do you think that these policies from OpenAI are going to make a difference in this election cycle, or do you think this is just them trying to preemptively sort of put a fig leaf out and say, like, we are trying our best, we have these policies, and if anyone does use our tools for political campaigning, we can point to our policy and say, well, you weren\u2019t allowed to do that?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that these policies are important in the sense that they set a norm, right? Like, OpenAI is the AI company that people are looking to to understand what is the responsible player that is under the most scrutiny doing here. And I do think that sort of raised the floor for the other companies, companies that might have wanted to be more permissive. Now, they\u2019re probably going to face pressure to do that less. At the same time, your true policy is what you enforce. And as we said, OpenAI has not always enforced its own policies. So my hope is that in the months ahead \u2014 and certainly, I think I\u2019ll be doing this \u2014 journalists pay close attention to, is there a big gap between what OpenAI said it was going to do and what it\u2019s actually doing here.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd how do these policies from OpenAI compare to the AI-manipulated media policies of some of the other big platforms?\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt\u2019s a good question. And I think it tells us something about how new all this stuff is that the policies are actually pretty different. Right? Like, there are some meaningful gaps in the ways that these companies are thinking about, and not everybody has the same policy. Meta has also banned political advertisers from using its generative AI ad creation tools. So if you\u2019re going to try to use generative AI in your political ads, you at least can\u2019t do it with Meta\u2019s own tech. Google will actually block you from using political keywords at all when you\u2019re using its ad creation AI tools. It also will watermark AI-generated imagery and audio, so that if you\u2019re looking, you can figure out how it\u2019s made.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOh, that\u2019s interesting. So if you want to run an AI-manipulated ad for your campaign on Facebook or Google, you can still do that. You just can\u2019t use those companies\u2019 own generative AI tools. Like, you could make something in Dall-E of yourself rescuing orphans from a burning orphanage, but you can\u2019t use that right in the ad creator itself. Is that right?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, that\u2019s right. And then, platforms also have rules around sort of disclosing when generative AI was used. And so even if you didn\u2019t use our tools but you posted it, some of the platforms are going to make you disclose, like, hey, we use some generative AI here. And we\u2019re actually seeing that in the state law. So among the states who have passed laws around that, this is really the most common approach, is to say, we\u2019re not going to ban you from using generative AI, but you do have to disclose it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. I think one thing that I\u2019m thinking is, like, no matter what OpenAI does or doesn\u2019t do or how it changes its policies, there are so many other tools out there at this point. It seems like the things that we\u2019re most concerned about, which is these deepfake videos and these manipulated audio clips, like what happened in Slovakia, you can\u2019t actually use OpenAI\u2019s technology to do that stuff. It\u2019s not part of their suite of products. But you can use other companies\u2019 tools. There are smaller companies, like ElevenLabs, which makes these voice-cloning audio things. There\u2019s now open-source versions of these video-creation algorithms. So these are maybe a little bit harder to access, but if you are a troll or a campaign operative, you\u2019re going to be able to do that stuff pretty easily. And so I think it\u2019s actually the smaller companies whose products we may need to watch out for more.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And I think a good secondary question to that, Kevin, is, OK, so let\u2019s say that you\u2019re one of these bad actors, and you use the open-source AI tool to create the terrible audio clones to try to swing the election. What are you going to do with it? Well, as we\u2019ve said, Google and Meta have policies that require there to be disclosures when ads are using AI. But X has not said anything about this, and my strong suspicion is, they are not going to aggressively enforce this stuff. So to the extent that people are still using X to get their news, I do expect we will see people really try to test the limits there. The other one that researchers are really interested in is Telegram, which is the messaging service, and they also have a very laissez-faire content moderation policy. They have to be dragged kicking and screaming into removing just about anything. So to the extent that Telegram is heavily used during this election, I think we could see a lot of deepfakes and other synthetic media flying around there.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally. And what\u2019s really sort of scary to think about is the extent to which elections, at least in the US, often are influenced by pieces of media, right? I mean, remember the Mitt Romney 47 percent video or the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape for Donald Trump. That kind of thing could be easily generated using AI. And I also think there\u2019s one other piece of this that doesn\u2019t get talked about as much, which is the danger that all this AI-generated media and these fears and conversations about AI-generated or manipulated media give politicians who actually do bad things the easiest possible out, right? It creates a kind of plausible deniability. You can imagine, if the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape had come out in 2024, Donald Trump could say, that\u2019s a deepfake. Now, I don\u2019t think it would have worked in that case, because that was, like, network footage from a TV show. But you can imagine a politician who does actually get caught doing something bad \u2014 taking a bribe, you know, posing for a photo with someone they shouldn\u2019t have \u2014 they just get the easiest excuse of all time now.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, academics have a great term for this. They call it \u201cthe liar\u2019s dividend.\u201d And it\u2019s basically, because there is so much falseness in the world, it becomes easier for politicians or other bad guys to stand up and say, hey, that\u2019s just another deepfake. So yes, that is something that we should watch. I think that that will actually become a bigger problem after the first, like, giant deepfake that takes the world by storm and briefly fools everybody. Like, we need to, I think, sort of have had that moment for a politician to be able to get away with that. But yes, absolutely something we should keep our eyes on.\n\nkevin roose\n\nMy hunch is that the biggest use of generative AI in this election cycle is actually not going to be in ads or in these giant October surprise manipulated media scandals. I think it\u2019s going to be in fundraising, and specifically in these horrible, manipulative guilt-trip fundraising emails. Do you get these?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, as a journalist, I don\u2019t donate to political campaigns.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI don\u2019t either, but I still get them.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, really? I mean, my friends tell me about them constantly. And it\u2019s always like, Casey, do you have five minutes? Democracy is at stake.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Right, right. It\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s like, Casey, it\u2019s Joe Biden. I\u2019m disappointed in you.\n\ncasey newton\n\n(LAUGHING) Yeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Or like, it\u2019s Pete Buttigieg. I\u2019ve got some questions I really want to ask you. Now, I think, with generative AI, the possibility to really target the stuff at voters exists, and it could be much more manipulative. It could be like, Casey, according to my last knowledge update, you have a fear of spiders. I\u2019m going to let a spider loosen your house, unless you give me $5.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And look, I mean, there is already a ton of A/B testing that goes into all of those subject lines, right? And maybe if we put it in lowercase, people would click on it more. If we change the sender to make it look like it\u2019s literally coming from Joe Biden, you\u2019ll open it more. So people are already doing everything they can think of to get you to open these emails. Once you put really good generative AI into that equation, I imagine, yes, it is going to become much more sophisticated and personalized. That said, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re actually there yet. I don\u2019t think the tools exist for ChatGPT to know that I\u2019m terrified of spiders. But \u2014\n\nkevin roose\n\nAre you terrified of spiders?\n\ncasey newton\n\n\u2014 let\u2019s check in again on the midterm. I mean, I\u2019m not generally excited when I see a spider. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say. If it\u2019s a spider that\u2019s, like, smaller than \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 like, a phone, and I see it in a bathroom, I\u2019m not terrified.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhere are there spiders that are bigger than a phone?\n\ncasey newton\n\nFlorida. It\u2019s why I won\u2019t go there.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: Are we talking, like, an iPhone Max?\n\ncasey newton\n\nNo, just sort of the normal, the Pro.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, the Pro.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo that\u2019s sort of the doom-and-gloom picture of AI and elections. But I want to ask you, is there any use of AI in elections or in campaigns that you think would actually be appropriate and might help democracy?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI mean, I \u2014 look, if we want to experiment with personalization and persuasion, I would be comfortable with people using that to get out the vote. If people want to build campaigns around how do we get people out to the polls, that seems OK with me. Now, of course, if we make that technology available, it will probably also be used by people who are trying to do persuasion around individual candidates or ballot issues. So that\u2019s going to be a bit of a double-edged sword. But that\u2019s what I would like to see. How about you? What do you think? Do you want to see generative AI in politics this year?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI just don\u2019t think we have a choice, right? Like, these tools we\u2019ve talked about are being built into basic enterprise software. So now, if you have Microsoft Word and you\u2019re using that to write something, like, it\u2019s just going to be able to suggest AI completions for that. If you\u2019re using Photoshop for your campaign ad, it\u2019s possible to use generative AI in that, too, not for any malicious purpose, but just to kind of spruce it up a little bit.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I can\u2019t wait till Microsoft Word is like, hey, it looks like you\u2019re trying to win an election. You want any help with that?\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: That\u2019s the Pro version. You got to pony up for that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo let me get a prediction from you, maybe, to close this out. Do you think that a year from now, we will be sitting across from each other, and when we think back on the 2024 US presidential election, do you think that generative AI is going to play a big role in the outcome, a medium role in the outcome, or a small or no role in the outcome?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI think for the presidential election, my prediction would be that it has a minor effect, for all the reasons that we talked about. If you\u2019re running for president, you\u2019ve got cameras and reporters following you everywhere you go. There\u2019s sort of a paper trail for anything that you say or do on the campaign. And it\u2019s going to be hard to manipulate that in a way that\u2019s not immediately debunkable by journalists and news organizations. But I think my answer changes if you are asking about state and local elections. There are some laws in some states that are going to maybe make that less of an issue, but I think in general, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of trickery in those elections. And so yeah. If I\u2019m running for city council or state senate or local school board, like, this is something that I\u2019m thinking about.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, you should be, because I\u2019ve already prepared some very convincing deepfakes of you. So sleep with one eye open, Roose.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYour opposition researchers have been working full-time.\n\ncasey newton\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. After the break \u2014 is crypto coming back?\n\ncasey newton\n\nGod, I hope not. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo Casey, I know you are someone who is very, very optimistic and positive about the crypto industry and its future.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI am not, Kevin. But I\u2019ll tell you that it is sort of like \u2014 you know how it seems like every Halloween, there\u2019s a new \u201cSaw\u201d movie? It feels like every January, someone tells me that crypto is making a comeback, and here you are, once again, popping up, as if at the end of a horror movie.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, I should say it brings me no pleasure to report what\u2019s going on in the crypto industry right now.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt gives you some pleasure to report what\u2019s going on in the crypto industry.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, only because it makes you so mad. But Casey, I want to talk about this today, because it seems like crypto is, yet again, rising from the grave.\n\ncasey newton\n\nKevin, I have deep misgivings about this, but I will allow you to make your case.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo this kind of thing happens a lot \u2014 crypto. There\u2019s a big bust, and then there\u2019s a boom, and then there\u2019s a bust and a boom. And so you know, crypto has been going through, I would say, a hard time. Many of the industry\u2019s most prominent figures \u2014 SBF, CZ from Binance \u2014 are in trouble with the law. Some of the biggest exchanges have been in trouble. There have been scams and frauds and lawsuits. And it\u2019s all just a huge mess.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll my old crypto heroes are in jail, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd yet, investors \u2014 some of them still remain optimistic that crypto is still worth investing in. And we got some news on this front on Thursday of last week, when Wall Street firms started allowing customers to trade Bitcoin through something called an ETF. So there\u2019s been a lot of optimism in the crypto industry about the approval of these Bitcoin ETFs. And these ETFs, as boring as they might sound, actually explain a lot of why people are calling this a crypto comeback.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And we should say that the US government fought these ETFs from becoming a reality, but they lost in court. And so now, here they are, and that is why we\u2019re talking about it today.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo as we found ourselves saying, \u201cWTF, ETF,\u201d there was only one person we could think to talk to, and that was, of course, DYB.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Yes. So David Yaffe-Bellany, my colleague at \u201cThe Times,\u201d is our go-to reporter on all things crypto. Let\u2019s bring him in here. David Yaffe-Bellany, welcome back to \u201cHard Fork.\u201d\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nThanks for having me.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHi, David.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo usually, when we have on the show, it\u2019s to explain how some facet of the crypto industry has melted down or someone is going to jail or some fraud is unraveling. But we have some really interesting news to talk about today, which is that crypto may be making a comeback. Am I right about that?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI maybe wouldn\u2019t go that far, but it\u2019s definitely a rare kind of good-news day for crypto. So people are celebrating.\n\nkevin roose\n\nLet\u2019s talk about this. Because I would say, just in my sort of anecdotal interactions over the last few weeks, people that I know who used to be really into crypto before the big crash are starting to talk about it again. And they\u2019re getting excited, and they\u2019re starting to talk about what coins they should invest in. And I\u2019m just, like, hearing about it more than I would say I have in the past year or so. So what is going on?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, the simplest explanation for that is that prices are going up again. And when prices go up, people get excited, because they see opportunities to make money. But the sort of question of why prices are going up after this horrible 18 months for crypto, where many of the biggest companies melted down, there were bankruptcies, there were criminal prosecutions \u2014 that\u2019s a really interesting question. And basically, what\u2019s been happening over the last six months or so is, there is increasing optimism that a new investment product for crypto is going to get approved by the SEC. And that probably sounds surprising, because the SEC is sort of notoriously anti-crypto, and the current chair, Gary Gensler, has made it one of his missions in life to, some would say, kind of eradicate crypto in the United States. But the SEC lost a big legal battle in August over something called a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, let\u2019s talk about that. Because I remember covering crypto, like, a decade ago. There was this dream, back then, of someday being able to buy and sell Bitcoin sort of on the stock market the way that you would buy or sell other kinds of ETFs.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd that dream was because, at the time, buying crypto was one of the most complicated things a human being could actually do.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Yes! No, literally, that was the reason for the push \u2014 was because there are \u2014 for many things that an investor might want to invest in, it is not practical to actually go out and buy the thing. Like, if I want to invest in gold or corn, if I think the price of corn is going to go up, I don\u2019t actually want to have a warehouse where I take delivery of my corn, right? I want to be able to buy and sell a thing that sort of acts like a security, that acts like a stock, but tracks the price of whatever I\u2019m actually interested in. Is that a good explanation of what an ETF is?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, I have a lot of friends with warehouses full of corn, but I understand what you\u2019re saying, yes.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo an ETF \u2014 I think we should explain \u2014 is just like \u2014 Casey, do you know what an ETF is? What\u2019s your best guess?\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt is a fund that is traded on exchanges, Kevin. But it\u2019s basically a way to \u2014 when the price of Bitcoin goes up and you own the ETF, you get a little taste of the action. And when the price goes down, then you get hurt.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWow.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSuch an eloquent explanation \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nThank you so much.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI think the dream from crypto advocates is that there are all these people who may be interested out there in investing in crypto, but they don\u2019t want to set up a Coinbase account or go through the hassle of, like, securing bitcoins in a wallet somewhere. Like, these are just people with retirement accounts, and maybe a little bit of money to invest. And if you could somehow make a product that could allow those people to participate in the crypto economy without actually owning crypto, they would be much more interested in doing that. And so therefore, the crypto economy as a whole would benefit from that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I think that\u2019s one way of describing it. Another way of describing it is that so far, the number of people that could lose money on crypto has been limited to people who actually go to the trouble of setting up these accounts and creating their seed phrases and storing their Bitcoin in hardware wallets. But now, by putting it on the stock market, any schlub with a Schwab account can go now and lose their entire life savings. And what could be more exciting to the fraudsters and the scammers who have been pumping this stuff up for the past 10 years then to have a whole new market of suckers to take advantage of?\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. So there\u2019s the optimists\u2019 and the skeptics\u2019 case. This has been a goal of people in the crypto industry for years now \u2014 getting one of these Bitcoin or crypto ETFs approved by the government. But it\u2019s been a long slog. So maybe you could sort of walk us through what\u2019s been happening and why, all of a sudden, these things are getting approved.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, so you\u2019re right. This is a more-than-decade-long dream of the crypto industry, to be able to trade this stuff on Wall Street in kind of a smoother way that\u2019s going to attract a sort of whole new audience of investors. But over and over again, the federal government, the SEC in particular, has shot down attempts to get this product approved. They\u2019ve made many of the points that Casey was just making \u2014 that this is a volatile product. You know, it\u2019s an industry that\u2019s riven with scammers. And it\u2019s risky to open up the audience of people who might play with this stuff to random guys with retirement accounts, basically. What changed is that one of the companies that was trying to offer the Bitcoin ETF, a company called Grayscale Investments, sued the SEC over the denial of their application to offer this ETF and ended up winning in court. And so essentially, the SEC was left with few options other than to approve a bunch of these things. And that\u2019s what ended up happening last week. The way that SEC approvals work is that there are four commissioners \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 and a chair, who can sort of be the swing vote some of the time. And in this case, the two Republican commissioners and the chair voted to approve these products. And basically, what the agency said was, we didn\u2019t have much of a choice.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo Gary Gensler, who is, as you pointed out, made it his career\u2019s mission to get rid of crypto in the United States, did ultimately vote for this, which surprised me. But I guess you say, in his view, he did not have an alternative.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, I mean, he issued a statement, which is \u2014 it\u2019s really kind of a remarkable statement. It was basically the bitterest thing that you could possibly say on this day when you\u2019re offering the crypto world this huge kind of celebratory moment. He was like, don\u2019t mistake this for an endorsement of Bitcoin. We still think crypto is bad. But the courts \u2014 they left us with no other option. That\u2019s essentially what the statement says. And there are still critics out there on the left saying that Gensler should not have voted to approve this stuff, that the SEC could have continued to fight. But he was certainly in a tough position legally.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt is one of the most incredible statements I\u2019ve ever heard from a financial regulator. I\u2019m just going to read from it, because I think it\u2019s very remarkable. Gary Gensler wrote, \u201cBitcoin is primarily a speculative volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity, including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing. While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot Bitcoin ETP shares today \u2014\u201d I guess ETP is Exchange-Traded Product, right?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\n\u201d\u2014 we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d So clearly, he\u2019s not a fan of this decision, even though he was one of the people who voted to allow it.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nMm-hmm. Yeah, this is a huge defeat for Gensler. I mean, this was one of \u2014 I mean, he\u2019s filed all these lawsuits, started all these fights with the crypto industry. A lot of them haven\u2019t really been resolved. They\u2019re kind of pending in the courts. This is one that he lost.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. How has the rest of the financial and crypto world been reacting to the approval of these Bitcoin ETFs? And by the way, how many ETFs are there now for Bitcoin?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nSo there are 11 ETFs that have been approved. Some of them are offered by big companies that you\u2019ve heard of, like BlackRock and Fidelity, which is a huge deal for crypto, because those sort of titans of traditional finance have historically stayed away from some of this stuff. And then, a bunch of them are also offered by kind of more crypto-specific companies, like Grayscale. But in terms of the reaction \u2014 I mean, first, I think it\u2019s difficult for people outside of the crypto world to understand just the level of obsession and anticipation around this approval. I mean, there are random Bloomberg intelligence analysts who know a lot about ETFs who basically became overnight celebrities on crypto Twitter and have hundreds of thousands of followers now hanging on their every word about whether the 19 B4 forms were filed on time and what that might suggest about when the approvals would come in. It was just total, absolute obsession for maybe a month leading up to the approvals of these products. And that was partly because people were banking on the idea that prices might shoot up once the approvals came in.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd did prices shoot up?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nPrices actually shot down, which was disappointing to a lot of people, but was soon explained as, you know, oh, this news had already been baked in to the price of Bitcoin, because everyone saw it coming. And in the long term, it\u2019ll still be beneficial. But yeah, it did sort of rain on the parade a little bit. But the parade continues.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, so you reported, as you just told us, that BlackRock and Fidelity and a bunch of other very traditional Wall Street firms are now offering these Bitcoin ETFs to their customers. But you also reported that some institutions, most prominently Vanguard, have decided not to offer these crypto ETFs. Why is that?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nSo Vanguard is not one of the companies that applied to offer one of these products, but you could still buy a Bitcoin ETF through the kind of Vanguard interface. And so the company said, no, we\u2019re not going to offer it, because it doesn\u2019t align with our vision of what a smart, long-term investment is. There wasn\u2019t a ton of detail, but clearly, if you read between the lines, what they\u2019re saying is that we don\u2019t trust this stuff, and we don\u2019t think we should be exposing our customers to it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. They\u2019re saying, if you want to help build the North Korean weapons program, you\u2019re going to have to do it with somebody else\u2019s ETF.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt\u2019s so funny. Like, I saw some crypto people on the internet getting really mad at Vanguard for this decision not to offer crypto products to their customers. And they were, like, posting things like, oh, does Vanguard want to miss the Bitcoin revolution? Does Vanguard not want to go to the moon? And it\u2019s like, well, no. It\u2019s Vanguard. It wants to be the most boring financial firm possible. It wants to take your retirement money, invest it in very unexciting things, and send you 15 pieces of mail a month for some reason.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nWell, you\u2019ve put your finger on the big irony here, which is that all of these so-called crypto revolutionaries, people who are like, let\u2019s blow up traditional finance, let\u2019s create an alternative to Wall Street, are suddenly relying on BlackRock to change the game for crypto. And it just shows how far the industry has swung from that initial vision.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIn other words, swinging to a giant legacy institution, rather than a bunch of punk rock kids in a garage somewhere.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, becoming exactly the thing that it was founded to replace.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, imagine that.\n\nkevin roose\n\nLet\u2019s talk about that. Because this is sort of the mind-bending part of all this, is that Bitcoin, crypto \u2014 these things were established as a protest against the traditional financial institutions, against BlackRock, against Fidelity, against Wall Street. But in order to grow, they have had to embrace and be embraced by the mainstream financial institutions. And if everyone is just sort of speculating on this stuff through their retirement accounts or their investment accounts, and they\u2019re not actually going out and starting their own hardware wallets and learning about the protocols and forming strong opinions, if this is just like one more thing like corn or oil or whatever that you can bet on, does that in some sense erode the original proposition of crypto?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, I mean, I think it does. It certainly shows that a lot of those kind of original ideals are no longer super relevant to the people who are kind of leading the charge in the crypto world. And there are some voices of dissent here and they\u2019re kind of making that point. A lot of people in crypto aren\u2019t big fans of BlackRock and are a little bit uncomfortable with the sort of level of obsession that people now have around the Bitcoin ETFs. But the other factor here is that the crypto community was so starved for good news. I mean, so many bad things have happened in crypto over the last 18 months, that I think that a lot of people were sort of prepared to dispense some of their principles and just embrace this, given how bleak things have been.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I mean, I would argue that the whole revolutionary argument around crypto, for the most part, has been a very thin veneer over a bunch of people who just hope that the number goes up forever, and that the reason that they\u2019re excited about this is now, it seems like there\u2019s another chance that the number can go up.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. And I think we should also say, like, these ETFs have only been trading for a few days, but they\u2019re very popular, right? I saw something about how there have been $10 billion invested in these Bitcoin ETFs in just the first three trading days.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nWell, so the crucial thing to understand is, I think that 10-billion figure is volume, so people trading it back and forth. That doesn\u2019t actually mean that 10 billion in new money has gone into the ETFs. You could buy the BlackRock share and the BlackRock ETF at 10 AM, and then sell it at noon. And that still counts as volume, even though there\u2019s actually a net-zero amount of new money going in. So what we really have to pay attention to is kind of in-cash inflows, and I believe that\u2019s more in the hundreds of millions. But it\u2019s still impressive. And all the ETF analysts have said this was a very kind of successful debut, and it suggests that, long-term, there could be a lot of interest and money coming in.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhat\u2019s your best guess, based on your reporting, of how much of this volume, how much of this interest in trading, these Bitcoin ETFs, is speculators, versus people who are actually kind of true believers or people who are interested in crypto and maybe optimistic about how these assets are going to gain value?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit hard to tell who\u2019s money exactly is going in. I mean, the most cynical reading is that crypto money is just moving around internally within the crypto world, that people are selling Bitcoin and buying a Bitcoin ETF, and then trading one Bitcoin ETF for a different Bitcoin ETF. And that\u2019s a lot of how crypto has worked historically, and so it wouldn\u2019t shock me if that\u2019s the case. But it is a fact that wealth managers across the US who control trillions of dollars in capital love ETFs. They\u2019re one of the most popular products in the kind of wealth management industry. And so some of this money probably does come from the person with a retirement account who is interested in some exposure to this but, like you were saying before, didn\u2019t want to open up a Coinbase wallet.\n\nkevin roose\n\nCan I ask a stupid question about this, which is, if I make a Bitcoin ETF, basically, what I\u2019m selling on the exchanges is like a sort of access to a share of a pile of Bitcoin that I am keeping on behalf of my investors. Like, if I end up losing my Bitcoin, or I lose the password, or it gets hacked and it disappears from wherever I was keeping it, like \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nThings that happen all the time in the world of Bitcoin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, like, do Ma and Pa with their retirement accounts have any claim to that? What is the sort of investor protection angle here?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, in theory, if the Bitcoin that BlackRock is sitting on were to disappear, or BlackRock were to go under, I mean, that could be an issue for the people who are investing in the ETFs. But the sort of custody point \u2014 I mean, Coinbase, the exchange, has partnered with most of these ETF issuers. And so Coinbase is the entity that actually has the Bitcoin and is housing the Bitcoin in its wallets.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd do you have the address of where all this Bitcoin is stored?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, I\u2019ll send that to you over a separate cover.\n\ncasey newton\n\nJust curious.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nWe can talk later.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nBut so basically, people are relying on Coinbase protecting this stuff. And Coinbase has a good track record of doing that, especially compared to a lot of other crypto firms.\n\ncasey newton\n\nCompared to Mt. Gox?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah. I know you\u2019re still sitting on a huge Mt. Gox bankruptcy claim \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, I\u2019m waiting for my Mt. Gox payout, I tell you.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd has this optimism in the crypto industry over the approval of these Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 has it spread anywhere other than Bitcoin? Like, are people starting to get excited about NFTs again or Web3 or blockchains of other kinds? Or is it sort of just contained to Bitcoin and the price of Bitcoin?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYou\u2019re seeing other coin prices go up as well. Solana has gone up a lot recently. That was one of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s favorite coins. But it\u2019s sort of rebounded from the sort of shame associated with that. Ether has also gone up, though not as much as the huge ethermaxies would have hoped. So yeah, this has caused some sort of wider optimism. And there are other factors as well. It\u2019s not all the Bitcoin ETF. You know, macroeconomic conditions have changed a bit. People are expecting the Fed to cut rates this year. And so all of those sort of broader factors that drove up crypto prices during the pandemic \u2014 some of them are coming back, too.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd what does this mean for crypto regulation? I mean, as we\u2019ve talked about with you before, regulators in the US are very hostile to crypto, and really, like, Gary Gensler and other leading regulators have sort of made it their mission to eradicate this stuff or keep it away from the mainstream financial system, to quarantine it into its own little economy that can rise or fall without hurting the economy as a whole. Do you see this as a setback for regulators?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, this is a huge setback for the Gensler agenda. I mean, you can read that in every sentence of that statement that he wrote, right? But it\u2019s worth remembering that Bitcoin has always sort of existed separately from the rest of crypto in the eyes of regulators. Gensler is not arguing that crypto is a security that ought to be governed by the same laws that govern stocks and bonds and that sort of thing. He sort of conceded that point that Bitcoin is something different, partly because there\u2019s no centralized Bitcoin incorporated that raises money to try to, like, boost the price of Bitcoin. But the sort of broader fight is still going on. I mean, as we speak, I was just listening to it before we started recording. There\u2019s a hearing happening and the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase \u2014 a four-hour hearing in Manhattan over this question of whether Bitcoin is a security.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSorry we made you step outside for a few minutes from that.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\n[CHUCKLES]: Um, yeah, it was a real loss. So that fight is going to continue. And that\u2019s a real sort of existential threat to the crypto world. If we get a court ruling that says, all of this stuff, it\u2019s all securities, then that\u2019s going to change a lot of the way that the industry operates, and maybe force it to flee the United States. And so that\u2019s still a kind of ongoing battle.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI mean, I do think we should try to \u2014 this has been a very \u2014 I would call it a skeptical conversation about the crypto comeback. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re also talking to people who are true believers in this stuff, who do think that this is a sort of watershed moment for the crypto industry and the crypto movement. What are those people saying?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, they say that this is sort of vindication for Bitcoin, that Bitcoin is the center of the crypto universe. It has clear applications beyond all this Web3 stuff. It\u2019s a store of value. It\u2019s been one of the best investments that you could make over the last 10 years. Sure, there are short-term kind of ups and downs. But if you look at the 10-year trend in the price of Bitcoin, it\u2019s way up, and that now, you\u2019re seeing the traditional finance industry say, we\u2019re taking this seriously, and that Bitcoin has some sort of role to play as a kind of digital gold, which was one of the initial visions for it. And I think that there\u2019s some sort of credence to that. And again, you can look at Bitcoin separately from the rest of crypto, and I think a lot of crypto skeptics might concede that Bitcoin has a kind of long-term place in our economy, even if you think that the rest of the industry is ridiculous.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. And I would also add to that, that I think \u2014 I think while a lot of investors and regulators and maybe people who have retirement accounts see the volatility of crypto \u2014 the fact that it can rise 50 percent one day and fall 40 percent the next day \u2014 as a bug, there are a lot of people who see that as a feature. There are people out there who want to get rich quick, who don\u2019t want to slowly compound their money over 20 years, who want to invest in something that they feel like they understand better than the people around them, and be paid back pretty quickly on that. So I think that the sort of volatility conversation is interesting, because it\u2019s so clear that that is not what some people, including regulators, want in an asset, but that is definitely what a lot of investors want in crypto.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, that makes sense to me.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. David Yaffe-Bellany, thank you for joining us.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, thanks so much for having me.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThanks, David.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWe\u2019ll let you go back to four-hour crypto hearing.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, I\u2019ll log right back on. I might have missed some exciting stuff.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhen we come back, how to sell a pencil on TikTok. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo Casey, we had an exciting moment happen this week. We had our biggest TikTok experience ever as the \u201cHard Fork\u201d podcast.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWe did. And I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not going to be cool about this. I actually was legitimately thrilled that this happened.\n\nkevin roose\n\nUnbelievable. So every week, we videotape ourselves making this podcast, and we put up clips on TikTok and YouTube. And one of these clips from last week\u2019s episode went viral. We got a million views.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, now, TikTok is big enough that I don\u2019t know if a million views truly counts as viral, but it\u2019s certainly our biggest clip ever, and it is, if nothing else, viral-adjacent.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd are you getting stopped on the street by Gen-Z TikTok users and complimented on your clip?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, they\u2019re inviting me to collab with them, teaching me a variety of dances. It\u2019s been a really fun week.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: So a taste of TikTok stardom we have now had on this podcast. But today, we are going to talk about something different that\u2019s happening on TikTok, which is that people are starting to sell things through TikTok.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI would frame it slightly differently, Kevin, and say that now that we are TikTok stars, we\u2019re asking ourselves, how do we make money off this thing? And that\u2019s when we found out about John Herrman\u2019s pencil.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) That\u2019s true. So our friend, John Herrman, who\u2019s a reporter for \u201cNew York Magazine\u201d and a great observer of things going on under the surface of the tech economy, has been writing a lot about e-commerce and, specifically, shopping on TikTok. And he recently did what I thought was a brilliant experiment, where he became a TikTok seller and attempted to sell his used mechanical pencil on TikTok. And I want to talk to him about this. Because I think it\u2019s not only a very funny stunt, but it\u2019s also just sort of a peek under the hood of one of the biggest platforms and how it is trying to change itself to become, I would say, more commercial. So people have been selling things on social media since, basically, the invention of social media. But what\u2019s different now is that it\u2019s being sort of built right into the app, where if you go on TikTok, there\u2019s now a whole sort of shopping category, a tab that you can end up in.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s gone from there being a small little convenience store inside of TikTok, to now, the entire app is just a shopping mall. And I think if you browse TikTok at all, you will see more and more posts from this shop being advertised at you. Perhaps you have had the question, why am I seeing this, and what is going on behind the scenes? And John went out and got that full story for us.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. Let\u2019s bring him in. John Herrman, welcome to \u201cHard Fork.\u201d\n\njohn herrman\n\nThanks for having me.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHello, John.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo you just wrote this fascinating piece about your experience selling a used pencil on TikTok Shop. So I want to talk to you about this experience. But first of all, what made you want to do this?\n\njohn herrman\n\nI didn\u2019t set out to sell this old pencil I had. I was just kind of poking around TikTok Shop, because like anyone who uses TikTok, I was seeing more and more content that was directly selling stuff. And it would be live streams of people doing QVC-style telethon sales pitches, or just people doing affiliate selling \u2014 things that they don\u2019t sell directly but they were hoping to make a commission on. And it was really just kind of everywhere. So I just jumped in. I read that it was easy to set up a store. So I started doing that.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how you actually sell something on TikTok, because this is not a feature that I have ever tested.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And if you have a mechanical pencil at home and you\u2019re looking to make some quick cash, I want you to grab your notebook and maybe a pen, and I want you to write down everything John is about to say. Because you could actually make a little bit of money here.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, and I think we should actually sell the fidget spinner that you are playing with on TikTok.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThis is a priceless antiquity. I would never sell it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIs this your grandmother\u2019s?\n\ncasey newton\n\nExactly. My grandmother\u2019s fidget spinner.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, so John, how do you sell a pencil on TikTok?\n\njohn herrman\n\nRight. So you look at the TikTok store, and you see something that looks like an e-commerce storefront \u2014 a place with listings, with sellers. It looks kind of professional, right? On the back end, it\u2019s a little bit more like signing up to sell something on eBay or Poshmark. It\u2019s kind of primitive. I logged in with my regular TikTok account. I declared my intention to become a seller. They asked me a few questions. I had to verify my identity. I had to provide government ID. And I reached around for products to list, just to see how those tools worked. I tried a half-eaten bag of dog food, which was rejected, because dog food is a prohibited category, unless you have pre-approval.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd when you say half-eaten, you mean eaten by the dog, right?\n\njohn herrman\n\nNo comment.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK. All right. Let\u2019s keep it moving.\n\njohn herrman\n\nA dog did make an appearance on my stream later, so I\u2019ll leave that up to \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK, all right.\n\njohn herrman\n\nNext thing I reached for was a pencil on my desk. It was just a thing. And so I lifted the pencil. I took five or six images. I uploaded them. I plugged in a few keywords \u2014 \u201cmechanical pencil,\u201d \u201cvintage.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to lie about it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI mean, \u201cvintage\u201d makes it sound much cooler than it is, to be fair.\n\njohn herrman\n\nWell, yeah, I\u2019m selling something. What do you \u2014 And TikTok offered to generate my listing for me, which I thought was helpful. I was just testing these tools out. Why not test another one? I hit the button. And it generated a pretty verbose listing, a couple hundred words that were, like, accurate in spirit.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[CHUCKLES]: Wait, read us the product listing that the TikTok AI came up with.\n\njohn herrman\n\nLet\u2019s pull it up here. Let\u2019s see. \u201cUpgrade your writing game with a classic mechanical pencil. This retro and vintage-inspired pencil is a must-have for any office or school setting. This used product comes without a battery or cord, making it easy to use anywhere. And with no warranty needed, you can trust that this mechanical pencil will last through all your writing needs.\u201d That\u2019s a really great way to describe something not having a warranty.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThat\u2019s a good pitch. That\u2019s a good pitch.\n\njohn herrman\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t settle for an average writing experience. Upgrade to the classic mechanical pencil today.\u201d That is entirely generated from a very short list of descriptive keywords. Did not edit it, went live with it. But when I got to the end of the process, TikTok prompted me to sell the product. And I thought, OK, I\u2019ll go live. That seems like the thing that people do. And so I pressed the button, and within seconds, I had more viewers than I had followers. I\u2019ve got, basically, no followers. This is an account that I use for work, for testing things out, never posted before. But I had hundreds of viewers. The most I saw concurrently was 360-something. Over the 10-or-so minutes that I streamed, TikTok\u2019s analytics told me that I had more than 1,200 viewers. And I can\u2019t emphasize enough how boring and stupid this stream was.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I think we should actually watch a little bit of your TikTok shopping stream together. Because it is just a remarkable piece of media, and the beginning of your stardom, your future as the QVC for Gen Z. So I\u2019ll pull it up here and screen-share.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI have \u2014 now, one thing I appreciated about this, John, was that you use an AR filter to show yourself wearing these virtual 2024 light-up sunglasses, which I thought really brought a lot of up-to-the-moment energy to what otherwise would just be a live stream of a man selling an old pencil.\n\njohn herrman\n\n[CHUCKLES]: Thank you. [CARNIVAL MUSIC]\n\ncasey newton\n\nNow, that\u2019s great music. Was that your music selection?\n\njohn herrman\n\nThat was a Spotify carnival playlist.\n\narchived recording (john herrman) Hey, hey. Thanks. It\u2019s a New Year\u2019s sale for \u2014 just a second \u2014 mechanical pencil. Barely used. Full eraser. Good lid. Ooh. Got some new people in the chat here for the New Year\u2019s sale. This pencil must go.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI appreciate that you are selling. You\u2019re not just sitting there with a pencil. You\u2019re demonstrating its features. You\u2019re talking up its selling points.\n\njohn herrman\n\nYeah. Later in the stream, I made the pitch that it was sort of like having an AI image generator in your hand. And the audience \u2014 I got to say, they went wild for that. They all tried to buy the pencil at once.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo this was obviously kind of a stunt, but I have a few questions about it. One is, did you actually manage to sell the pencil?\n\njohn herrman\n\nI did, but to a friend who joined when I asked them to. I did get three or four organic cart ads, meaning the pencil read as unavailable to other people, because it was in someone\u2019s cart. But no one followed through on that. So this was more of a conventional social commerce situation. I reached out to a connection that closed the sale.\n\nkevin roose\n\nHow much did you sell it for?\n\njohn herrman\n\nI sold it for $1. I got $0.69 of that. That has not yet been deposited into my bank account. TikTok paid for shipping, that was a little more than $4, as part of their promotional schemes to promote TikTok Shop.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWait, so on an item that cost $1 that you made $0.69 of, TikTok subsidized the entire cost of shipping that pencil?\n\njohn herrman\n\nThat\u2019s right. It was listed as having free shipping. I had no say over that. But all potential customers saw that this was $1, free shipping.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd TikTok then lost at least four times the value of the product on this sale.\n\njohn herrman\n\nYeah, and \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhich, I think \u2014\n\njohn herrman\n\nTo be honest, the product is probably worth about $0.15.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, I really enjoyed this stunt and everything that you wrote about it in your story, John. And I think it\u2019s just worth taking a moment to note how prevalent this sort of thing has become on TikTok. As you note in your piece, this is something that TikTok users are expressing a lot of frustration over. I\u2019ve come to think of it as orange TikTok. Because as you\u2019re swiping through videos, there\u2019s now a prominent little orange box that will tell you, hey, you can actually buy this thing right now. It\u2019s kind of like a Home Depot orange. And I instinctively have learned to just flick past those things. Because when I was going through TikTok today just to see what will be the first thing that TikTok shows me today, it was a $56 pack of Pokemon cards. And TikTok knows how old I am. Like, I\u2019m not buying Pokemon cards. And I feel like, as you write about, John, the variety of things that TikTok is selling just seems like totally disconnected, in many cases, from what users might want.\n\njohn herrman\n\nYeah. I mean, to be clear, I was eventually \u2014 or my product, rather \u2014 was delisted, because used products are not allowed, except for verified luxury handbags and things like that. However, it did illustrate that TikTok is both making it very easy to sell, because they really want people to sell, and also that they\u2019ve put a lot of muscle behind moving these products. They offer a lot of very deep discounts on the buyer and seller sides. And more important, I think, is that they offer some promotional firepower that just isn\u2019t available anywhere else. If you\u2019re selling on Amazon or Temu or through a Shopify account, ultimately, you are either trying to build a giant, organic social following, which is hard work \u2014 takes a lot of time, it\u2019s expensive. Most of the time, you can\u2019t do it. Or you\u2019re spending a lot of money with social networks. Maybe you\u2019re spending a lot of money on Google. And what TikTok can offer and is offering right now is just, basically, the ability to spam a whole bunch of people \u2014 not people who follow you, not people who\u2019ve expressed any specific interest in what you\u2019re selling, but just sort of, like, they will run a very fast, ongoing A/B test on a bunch of users for your store to try to get you some traction. They recommend that people stream for two-plus hours in order to let the algorithm work \u2014 that\u2019s a serious suggestion that they make to sellers \u2014 in order to, basically, test and test and test to see who sticks around and who maybe converts sales. That\u2019s something that TikTok seems to be betting is worth it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd it makes sense for a lot of reasons that TikTok would try this. You just named some of them. I think that, sort of, mobile e-commerce \u2014 shopping apps on your phone are huge in China. Live mobile shopping is huge in China. And so many investors and developers have come along over the past half-decade or so and thought, we ought to just be able to port this over to the United States. Like, Americans, at one time, loved their QVC. There\u2019s no reason to believe that they wouldn\u2019t want something like this on their smartphones. And yet, we have just seen company after company butt their heads into what turned out to be a brick wall. With Instagram, I was honestly shocked it didn\u2019t work, right? You think about some of the big creators there, like the Kardashians, and the degree to which they\u2019ve been able to build these fortunes, just based on recommending products, eventually creating their own product lines and promoting them there \u2014 it\u2019s working for some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world. And yet, when you fast-forward to the story of TikTok, and you see how it is working out for them, you see a man trying to sell a mechanical pencil for $1, and it just feels like something is broken there. So I\u2019d be curious to get your thoughts on, do you think that TikTok thinks this is working? And is there anything that they could be doing that would make it work better than it is working right now?\n\njohn herrman\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know if they think it\u2019s working. They did recently reduce some of the subsidies for sellers and buyers. This is something that we\u2019ve seen with other platforms. Temu, sort of famously, is losing huge amounts of money on virtually everything.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTemu is an online shopping platform.\n\njohn herrman\n\nYeah, and they sell mostly direct from China, mostly low-cost goods, and they\u2019ve been running an incredibly expensive and, I think, pretty effective ad campaign for a couple of years now, to try to break into the US market on behalf of a parent company with roots in China. So Temu is sort of a lot of people\u2019s first experience with this style of commerce, this sort of strange, random-feeling grids of products that you scroll through, with a very gamified interface, lots of promotions and coupons. And a lot of those mechanics are on display in TikTok. But yeah, the difference is that Temu has to break in somehow. They have to buy a Super Bowl ad, which they did. They have to spend money with TikTok, which they\u2019ve done. TikTok just is TikTok. So they\u2019re kind of running that e-commerce playbook, but they\u2019re doing it without that huge extra expense of marketing everything.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt\u2019s just such a strange pivot to me. It\u2019s like, we\u2019ve made this app. Young people all over the world love it. It\u2019s where a lot of culture is originating. You can find people in entertainment and politics there. It\u2019s like \u2014 and we\u2019re going to use all of this collective attention and direct it at the bargain bin of the internet. And that is how we\u2019re going to make money. It\u2019s just a very strange proposition. And yet, as you talk about in your piece, this has worked in China. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, was apparently on track last year to sell more than $270 billion worth of stuff on its app.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of mechanical pencils.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThat\u2019s so many mechanical pencils.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\njohn herrman\n\nI feel like this there are two ways to look at this from TikTok\u2019s perspective. One is that it\u2019s just great to be in commerce. If you could become a dominant commerce platform, if you could take some market share from Amazon or Shein or compete with Temu or whatever, this is all great. You diversify your product away from the fleeting whims of social media audiences. You also solve a problem that TikTok\u2019s had for a long time, which is that its creators don\u2019t have a ton of ways to monetize. By giving people the chance to sell stuff \u2014 not their own stuff, but to tack on that affiliate link in the middle of a broadcast, it\u2019s potentially a way to make quite a bit of money. That is something that I think solves a couple problems for TikTok, and one huge problem for at least certain categories of TikTok influencer.\n\ncasey newton\n\nMy complaint here is that I feel like TikTok has basically doubled the ad load with its shop, right? Because already, when I browse TikTok, I would say I\u2019m seeing an ad every, like, six or seven videos. But now, there\u2019s orange TikTok, which is effectively just a different kind of ad from somebody who\u2019s trying to sell me a pair of viral kitchen shears or something. But there is something exhausting. Because as a TikTok user, what I generally want is to see something funny or cool. That\u2019s why I will open up the app. I am not looking to just sort of impulse-shop, although I understand millions or hundreds of millions of people are. But my curiosity is, how does TikTok eventually navigate the fact that I think there are a lot of people like me that are not on there to shop and do not just want to look at a bunch of cheap crap every time we open the app?\n\njohn herrman\n\nWell, if I could offer a general, small prediction here, you know, right now, we\u2019re watching TikTok try to onboard a bunch of sellers to try to normalize the shopping experience, to try to prove that it can work. If it does kind of work, I think we\u2019ll see something similar to what we usually see with new features like this, which is, it\u2019ll sort of disappear into the background of the platform. The promotional advantage that you\u2019ll get from using this new feature will be lower than when it was brand new and TikTok really wanted to work. And this promotional power will sort of be \u2014 it\u2019ll become a product. You know, like, Amazon was an incredible place to reach new customers for lots of different businesses. Gradually, over time, to reach those customers, you needed to buy more advertising. Like, that massive surge of \u2014 or at least, massive in-context surge of attention that I got for just a total nonsense store test \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of thing that you will eventually have to pay for. They can still offer it. But once people understand that the audiences are there, that the audiences are worth acquiring, then TikTok can start ramping up monetization on this new product. But for now, until TikTok is a shopping app to most people, they won\u2019t quite do that. And so it\u2019ll feel a little bit artificial, a little bit off. But as you said, you\u2019re getting a preview of what that could look like in the long term \u2014 more ads, just a new ad product.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIs TikTok doing more than just sort of giving the platform for people to sell this stuff? Like, I imagine they don\u2019t have TikTok warehouses. They\u2019re not doing what Amazon does, which is, give people the marketplace, but also sell stuff themselves and hold inventory and do shipping and logistics. Is TikTok doing any of that or signaling that it\u2019s going to do any of that? Or is it just purely giving people the tools to sell stuff and get it in front of people?\n\njohn herrman\n\nThey\u2019re actually taking some pretty big steps in that direction. No, they\u2019re not trying to become a big first-party retailer. They\u2019re not building hundreds of warehouses and millions of square feet of space. But they are working with some pretty formidable logistics partners to make it possible to actually run a real store on the platform. That\u2019ll take some time to really spin up. But they\u2019re signaling that they want this to be a place to actually sell products.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd after your experience selling your mechanical pencil for $1 on TikTok, did that change your view of whether this TikTok shopping project is likely to succeed or not?\n\njohn herrman\n\nI think the best judge of whether or not this will work is, it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s, like, an avid, young TikTok user who takes the platform for granted, who\u2019s been there the whole time, and who is feeling either annoyed by this or who is, in fact, excited about it. So like most predictions with TikTok, we\u2019re sort of like, we\u2019re kind of talking around the fact that this isn\u2019t entirely for us. But yeah, I don\u2019t know. One thing that it did reaffirm for me is that there is something still unique about TikTok as an attention platform. The combination of the size of its audience and its both ability and willingness to test things out on that audience, to find audiences for content in pretty blunt and sometimes crude ways, I think, are really notable. Like, forget targeting. Forget identifying exactly who someone is, and then trying to imagine what they want or whatever. Forget, like, putting people in demographic categories in the conventional social media way. Let\u2019s just start from scratch and imagine everyone is a little content-consumption data point, and just run that through. I mean, the process of doing that is so weird and so strangely compelling as you go through it. Like, the amount of strange things that you encounter on TikTok as a regular user is pretty high. But you tolerate it, because it\u2019s kind of interesting. You kind of wonder why you\u2019re seeing something. And then, the next thing you see is something that you actually watch. And the shopping experience is, I think, a lot like that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOne other thing that you made me think of, John, that I do appreciate about TikTok is that there is something \u2014 like, \u201cruthless\u201d is one accurate way to describe it. And it\u2019s also quite unpretentious. You know, so many of these other social apps will talk endlessly about creating a community and, you know, harnessing the power of the community to create and share. And TikTok doesn\u2019t bother with that at all. They just say, you are here to consume, and we will show you a wide variety of things. And whatever you like to consume, we\u2019ll give you more to consume. And that\u2019s actually the entire point of this. There is no higher purpose. You\u2019re here to consume, so consume, you filthy animal.\n\njohn herrman\n\n(LAUGHING) Yeah, that\u2019s absolutely right. I mean, it\u2019s so anathema to how a lot of people think about who they are on Instagram, what they do there. You shop on Instagram now. And what that means, really, is you\u2019re engaging with ads, and those ads are often polished, and you\u2019re going through that funnel. And then, on some of these other apps like Temu or Wish or whatever, and now on TikTok Shop, it\u2019s just stuff. It\u2019s much more like walking into a trade show in Shenzhen, seeing LEDs everywhere, clothing in every shape and size and color. It\u2019s still kind of fun, you know.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. What I like about TikTok shop is, like, it\u2019s \u2014 finally, a social media app is treating its users with the contempt they deserve. It\u2019s not this aspirational space where it\u2019s like, oh, you could be a person with great skincare, or \u2014 it\u2019s like, you want cheap crap. We know it. And we\u2019re going to just feed it to you endlessly. John, are you going to sell anything else on TikTok?\n\njohn herrman\n\nMy pencil listing was removed as a violation of TikTok\u2019s rules. This is the only communication I\u2019ve received from the company about this entire debacle. However, they have been emailing me every single day, despite the listing being banned, informing me that I\u2019m missing out on $1 of sales for every day that I don\u2019t restock my SKU. So I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll see. Maybe tomorrow, I buy a pack of mechanical pencils and give it a go.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThis is actually how journalism can be saved. Like, every media organization just needs to pivot to TikTok commerce. I mean, start pawning off the decor in the podcast studios, the pencils, the notebooks. I mean, we could have a lucrative side business here.\n\ncasey newton\n\nEverything must go.\n\njohn herrman\n\nA pledge drive. All those fine folks over at NPR \u2014 they\u2019re ready to go. They\u2019re going to be superstars on this.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhere are the tote bags? All right, John Herrman, thanks for coming.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThanks, John.\n\njohn herrman\n\nThanks for having me. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou know, between Bitcoin ETFs and selling on TikTok, we\u2019ve given our users two truly terrible ways to make money this week, Kevin. So if you had \u201cimprove your financial prospects\u201d as one of your New Year\u2019s resolutions, maybe just ignore everything you hear on this episode.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, don\u2019t listen to the \u201cHard Fork\u201d podcast.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, uh, get a real job. That\u2019s our advice. Just do \u2014 just do a sort of standard 9-to-5. Sell your labor for money. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s really going to be better than anything you heard about here today.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton"

        "content": "Exchange-traded fund experts anticipate spot bitcoin ETFs, which debuted this month, to spark a new wave of crypto products.\n\nCboe Global Markets' Catherine Clay believes options are a natural progression for bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\"We believe that the utility of the options, what they provide to the end investor in terms of downside hedging, risk-defined exposures into bitcoin, really would help the end investor and the ecosystem,\" the firm's global head of derivatives told CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week.\n\nThe Cboe, the largest U.S. options exchange, filed with the SEC on Jan. 5 to offer options linked to bitcoin exchange-traded products. It expects those options to begin trading later this year, per its news release.\n\nAccording to Dave Nadig, financial futurist at VettaFi, options on the crypto funds could appeal to institutional investors, who have been more reluctant to invest in the digital asset class.\n\n\"You're going to start seeing all sorts of hedge fund players in the space,\" he said in the same interview. \"Folks who might not have been traditionally speculating on crypto directly in the crypto ecosystem are now going to have something to play with.\"\n\nNadig also suggested that zero-day options \u2014 contracts that expire the same day they're traded, commonly known as \"0DTEs\" \u2014 would be the ultimate goal for bitcoin derivatives products.\n\n\"If what happens in bitcoin is what's happened in single stocks, we're going to see retail in particular and a lot of institutions move towards zero days to expiration options trading on bitcoin itself,\" he said.\n\nStill, Cboe's Clay cautioned that those products could be very far away.\n\n\"We still have not even received approval to list options, so let's not get ahead of ourselves and think about 0DTEs,\" she said. \"We want to get options on these ETFs in a very intelligent and thoughtful way that actually \u2026 really builds the ecosystem of new entrants into the market.\"\n\nDisclaimer"

The sad thing is, the argument works just as well in reverse: Even if demand for bitcoin is just a matter of social contagion, then so is skepticism, because you need to hear about something to turn away from it.

        "title": "Why Satoshi Nakamoto is smiling at BlackRock\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin - Fortune",
        "content": "The SEC\u2019s recent decision to approve nearly a dozen Bitcoin ETFs was hailed as a major win for crypto. But not by everyone. On X/Twitter, a disgruntled faction of the cryptocurrency community cried foul over the alleged heresy of a Bitcoin product custodied and marketed by the likes of BlackRock. The most common objection seems to be that \u201cBitcoin doesn\u2019t need an ETF\u201d and that using intermediaries to purchase it\u2014particularly ones from Wall Street\u2014perverts the ideal of decentralization.\n\nOn the more extreme end, people like self-described researcher \u201cChris Blec\u201d went so far to as to suggest that BlackRock and others might conspire to alter Bitcoin\u2019s core features. And OG Bitcoiner Max Keiser warned of a scenario where the Bitcoins held by ETFs get confiscated by the U.S. government.\n\nThis outcry is misguided. A Bitcoin ETF is a great thing for furthering the original mission of the Bitcoin project, and it\u2019s safe bet that Satoshi Nakamoto\u2014wherever he is\u2014is nodding happily at this new tool to acquire his creation.\n\nRecall Bitcoin is meant to be a type of peer-to-peer digital cash that can\u2019t be usurped by the whims of any intermediary. And if Bitcoin is meant to enable individuals to be their own bank, an ETF strengthens its case as a store of value. The way a store of value works is that you buy it with excess savings and sell it when you need to consume it at a later point. The way a censorship-resistant, seizure-resistant store of value works is that you buy it when you need the protection it affords you and sell it when you don\u2019t. In other words, people willing to hold Bitcoin without needing its raison d\u2019etre render a valuable service to those who do need it.\n\nI buy Bitcoin largely because other people will accept it. If I were living in an authoritarian regime, I would prefer to buy Bitcoin over the local currency because I know it has a global market outside of the capital controls destroying my wealth. Knowing there is a Bitcoin market that caters to even the most straight-laced investors in the world\u2019s largest capital market only strengthens that case.\n\nBitcoin was engineered for censorship resistance and portability, which means it can be taken anywhere in the world. Keeping Bitcoin safe is a matter of keeping a string of characters a secret, one that could reside in your head if need be. It\u2019s a sad sign of the times that this feature of Bitcoin is becoming more important as capricious government policies leave more and more people \u201cunbanked.\u201d Even sadder is that the use cases for Bitcoin have grown due to armed conflict and massive capital flight in recent years.\n\nBitcoin holders have always rendered a service to Bitcoin needers. Over the last decade, companies like Coinbase and Kraken have made it easy to set up accounts on their exchanges to buy a Bitcoin or a fraction of a Bitcoin. It\u2019s fair to wonder what the market is for Bitcoin ETF buyers in 2024.\n\nUnder existing regulations, it\u2019s much simpler for an ETF to be held in an IRA or a 401k than any type of crypto token because the issuers of these assets are audited in a way that\u2019s compatible with the requirements of modern financial services. Thus, ETFs can broaden the market by appealing to a different segment of potential consumers. What\u2019s more, fewer bad experiences with security and liquidity for the average Bitcoin owner mean better outcomes for the industry\u2019s reputation. For years, journalists have breathlessly covered stories about lost fortunes due to user error\u2014and come up with creative accounting methods to exaggerate their impact.\n\nTo put it another way, spot Bitcoin ETFs help solve the last-mile problem for cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency market has, to date, been saturated by ideologues and gamblers. The appearance of audited vehicles holding Bitcoin creates more liquidity globally without alienating potential users by burdening them with esoterica that early ideologues (like me) readily tolerated. Instead of making a commitment to finding security solutions that usually resemble a Rube Goldberg machine, the marginally interested, crypto-curious consumer can now enjoy an easy entry into this grand experiment. Bitcoin may not need an ETF, but it certainly needs an alternative to safety deposit boxes and Ledger devices.\n\nAverage folks, not just the tech savvy, who are Bitcoin-curious can now contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity by dipping their toe into the ETF pool. Ultimately, this should be celebrated by even Bitcoin\u2019s most old school believers\u2014not to mention the people using it as a lifeline.\n\nKathleen Breitman is a cofounder of Tezos.

        "title": "After the Approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, What's Next for BlackRock and Franklin Templeton? - CoinDesk",
        "content": "We uh let our digital Asset team loose on Twitter and uh they had a great time and we've had a great time. We thought what a fun way to take the old fashioned image of Ben, right, Ben Franklin for Franklin Templeton and give him the laser eye that shows we really understand, believe in and support where we see Bitcoin headed, that was head of strategy for Franklin Templeton's Digital Asset Unit. Sandy call on all that banter on X formerly known as Twitter. I can't stop calling it Twitter one day, maybe I'll get there good afternoon and welcome to first mover on coin desk on this show. You get all of your top news headline and interviews with industry heavy hitters and today is a big one. We talked to Blackrock and Franklin Templeton just over a week after they both started trading the spot. Bitcoin ETF S in the United States. We'll hear from them in just a moment, but let's take a look at what's going on in the news this morning. The last week has been all about Bitcoin on the back of the spot, Bitcoin ETF News. But analysts and traders are also watching Ether closely in 2023 Ether underperformed Bitcoin. And now analysts are saying that investors will likely have a re look at the second largest Cryptocurrency by market cap this year as it is still the world's leading smart contract Blockchain with key upgrades lined up in a weekly newsletter. Coinbase said quote last week, Bitcoin ETF news proved to be a boon for Ethereum which briefly spiked above $2700 reaching the highest price since May 2022. And there are reasons to be even more optimistic about its near term future. For one, several of the firms behind the Bitcoin ETF S including Blackrock and Van Eck are also plotting Ether based by ETF S end quote. But JP Morgan thinks there are still some challenges ahead. According to the investment bank. The probability of the sec approving a spot E TT F by May is no more than 50%. JP Morgan points to lawsuits against crypto exchanges offering staking services for proof of stake blockchains including Ethereum. They say that this makes the approval of a spot Ether ETF more challenging. And Donald Trump is out with his latest NFT project. The former US president's NFT venture announced on X that collectors who purchased 100 of his mugshot NFTS, which cost $99 will get a unique card in the form of an ordinal on the Bitcoin Blockchain. But buyer beware the ordinals and the 100 NFTS you have to buy to get the ordinal cannot be traded by owners until December 2024. The thread on X said the restriction is meant to reduce their appeal as investment vehicles. This spot Bitcoin ETF update is presented by Grayscale, the world's largest crypto asset manager. Blackrock's move into the crypto space surprised the industry when they filed for a spot. Bitcoin ETF with the SEC in June last year. Yesterday, after one week of trading, the firm spot Bitcoin ETF became the first in class to reach $1 billion in assets under management with 11 asset managers receiving approval. At the same time, we caught up with Blackrock head of digital assets, Robbie Mitch Nick to talk about how the firm plans to stay competitive. Let's take a look, Robbie, how is it going? How are you feeling one week later? How many parties have you guys had over there? Hey, Jan. Well, thanks for having me on. Not, not too many parties. To be honest, we've been uh very focused on uh the launch which is has gone very well. Um You know, we're excited about that and we've had lots of uh client interest uh as you can expect. And so we've been kind of all hands on deck um being out there talking to clients and educating them on, on the project product and the story and um and all the elements of it, I believe Blackrock now has over a billion dollars in their ETF, uh fund. Is that what you were expecting? Were you expecting more? Were you expecting less? How, how is the traction matching expectations? Yeah, I don't think anyone knew exactly what to expect. You know, this was, uh, an unprecedented, uh, dynamic in, in many ways. And, um, you know, we're, we're very pleased obviously with, uh, the early results. Um, you know, product has, uh, traded, very significant volumes, has been been quite liquid. And um you know, we've seen obviously the strong inflows that, that, you know, so, um you know, we're, we're very bleak now for those in the crypto industry, this has been a 10 year long battle and some were uh shocked and pleasantly surprised when Blackrock decided to throw its hat in the ring um and submit an application for a spot, Bitcoin ETF in the United States. What went into making that decision? How have you been tracking the digital asset industry? Uh And how are you looking at it moving forward? Yeah. Well, it's been really a multiyear journey for us. Um You know, and I think uh it, it, it's been very much uh client focused in terms of how we've engaged in this space and what our strategy has been, we've been focused on uh being able to provide uh solutions and, and access vehicles in this space to those clients who seek it. And so when we look at what we've done over multiple years you know, partnership with, with Coinbase or partnership with the Circle and the technology capabilities we build. Um You know, this is a natural extension uh of that journey that we've been on. Robbie. Everyone's talking about the competition. 11 asset managers got that approval at the same time as Blackrock did. Uh Some are saying that Blackrock, although it is the largest asset manager in the world, like I mentioned at the beginning of this industry, at the beginning of this interview, excuse me, uh that Blackrock isn't a crypto native firm and some of the crypto native asset managers are using that to say, come, come trade with us. How would you respond to that? Yeah, I think we, we're very focused on the capabilities we bring across uh the spectrum here. So obviously, uh you know, we've been a leader in the ETF space for multiple decades. Um We've been a leader in innovation in, in many areas within, within ETF S and uh this is another of those, but I also think it's important to look at the digital asset capabilities that, that we've built uh alongside that I'm thinking in particular about our partnership with, with Coinbase dating back to the 2021. And um the integration that, that we did between Coinbase Prime and Aladdin to make Bitcoin work uh with Aladdin and then be able to run it on, on the same ETF servicing platform that, that supports three trillion in ishares assets. I think that's a really important part of what we, we bring to the table here and being able to provide an ishares quality product uh, to investors. One of the big headlines this week has been all about the fees. I know Blackrock reduced their fees. I think the latest asset manager to reduce fees yet again was Franklin Templeton bringing them down to 0.19. Are you expecting your fees to, uh, reduce even further? And I guess on top of that, how, how are you planning to remain competitive with 10 other asset managers, uh, offering the same product? You know, I think, um, you know, fees are just one part of the story, right? Um, you know, is the overall value proposition of the product, but we certainly feel like our fees, uh, today are, are, you know, very compelling and we've gotten, uh, you know, positive feedback from, from clients around that. And that's part of what we try to, to do at ishares is to, to be able to provide, um, low cost, high quality access solutions. And, and we think we've done that here. Are your clients knocking down the door for a spot E TT F. Uh, all I could say is, you know, we, we did file, uh, for that in November, um, and you know, who knows how that ends up playing out, but certainly the majority of our client interest today is in, in Bitcoin. Have you had any uh engagement with the regulator on that spot e ETF application so far or has the focus really been on the Bitcoin one? Yeah, that, that one I can't comment on unfortunately. All right, when it comes to digital assets moving forward, what are you looking at, you know, you, you look closely at this industry outside of Bitcoin and Ether. Uh how is blackrock looking at the industry in general? Yeah. Well, we think of the space across kind of 33 buckets, three key areas of of focus where uh you know, innovation of significance is happening. One bucket is is crypto uh itself. Uh a second is stablecoin. So we've done a lot. It was the primary reserve manager on the, the circle us DC reserve and it's done a lot of interesting technology collaboration with them there as well. And then the third is is tokenization which we think is, you know, more of a uh longer term trend in terms of how that's gonna play out. But um you know, we're very excited about the efficiency and access uh opportunities that tokenization may present as well. And zoom out a little further for me coming from traditional finance. How do you think traditional finance and crypto will work together to build out the future of finance? What does the future look like to you? Yeah, it's a great, it's a great question. I think, you know, we think about the potential of this technology and this idea that you can have uh transparency that you can have global transactions uh in near real time and near near zero cost that things can be digitally native and programmable. I mean that unlocks all kinds of interesting applications in terms of, you know, efficiency cost access. Um And so we're excited about uh about all that and that's why, you know, you've seen the exploration and the initiatives we've undertaken to date. Ok, Robbie, we're gonna have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining first mover. Thanks so much for having me on Jed. That was Blackrock head of digital assets, Robbie Mitnick. Let's take a look at the chart of the day. The chart of the day is presented by crypto.com, the leading crypto platform trusted by over 80 million users worldwide. Today's chart of the day is all about crypto crime. According to chain analysis, 2023 saw a significant drop in value received by illicit Cryptocurrency addresses totaling $24.2 billion 0.34 percent of total on chain value. The majority of crypto received by illicit addresses is marked by the green on this chart representing sanctioned entities. The second largest amount is attributed to scams. The on chain analytics firm says in the report that they should caveat by saying these figures are lower bound estimates based on inflows to illicit addresses. They've identified the number should become higher as they identify more illicit addresses and incorporate their historic activity. All right, that is enough with crypto crime today. Let's get back to the spot. Bitcoin ETF S. This next asset manager has stolen the buzz on X with their banter and they have their sights set on even more digital asset offerings moving forward. Joining us now to weigh in on what happens from here is head of strategy for Franklin Templeton's Digital Asset unit. Sandy call Sandy. welcome to the show. It's nice to see you again. Great to be here, Jen, nice to see you again as well. Ok, Sandy, this is what everyone wants to know your Twitter account. A drastic change happened as soon as that ETF was approved, what's going on. We uh let our digital asset team loose on Twitter and uh they had a great time and we've had a great time because we're big believers in digital assets and we thought what a fun way to take the old fashioned image of Ben, right, Ben Franklin for Franklin Templeton and give him the laser eye that shows we really understand, believe in and support where we see Bitcoin headed. Um And we've really had fun with the social media since then as well. Um You know, a lot of the big traditional asset managers still are uncomfortable with this channel. But luckily, we have uh lots of great young, engaged and enthusiastic people in our team who really love like engaging in that medium and so they, they've been having a great time and it's really so fun because they've worked so hard to get us to this point. So it's been a really fun week for everyone on the team. Sandy take us behind the scenes a bit. When I think about an asset manager as established as Franklin Templeton, I think that sometimes in organizations like this, it's hard to make change quickly, especially a drastic change like this. What, what was the um I guess was it an uphill battle to try and get the strategy approved? Uh you know what it actually was not? Um We're so fortunate Franklin because from our Ceo Jenny Johnson down, um there's a huge belief in bringing our clients and our investors um the best possible investment opportunities and being headquartered in Silicon Valley. Uh We're very attuned to new technologies. And then when you think about what happened last year with generative A I, there was so much buying interest and you saw so many investors really able to benefit from this new technology coming out, but it's been hard to benefit from the new technologies that are emerging from the crypto domain because you've had to have specialized accounts or you've had to have access to digital wallets or work with ex changes that aren't registered. Uh And all of this has really kept this opportunity out of a lot of investors portfolios. Uh And that's why we were so enthusiastic about the ETF as an access vehicle because it's really opening up this entire new uh innovation uh area to investors to really benefit from the growth and, and the new technologies that are emerging from it. We are a week and a day out from the day when asset managers started trading that spot, Bitcoin ETF, talk to us about the interest that your firm is seeing. Is it meeting expectations exceeding them? Yeah. So we have 22 views on this, right? There's the short term view and we're so thrilled with the growth of the overall Bitcoin ETF uh ecosystem. You know, we've never seen a situation like this where so many firms launched at the same time. And so it's really exciting to watch the horse race. Uh But where we think the real battle is going to occur is as this moves out of kind of the speculative, direct to consumer channel and in to the more wealth channels. And that takes time to get listed on these platforms, they need to really examine and look at each product and how it performs. And this is where Franklin Templeton's strength lies. So we've done great uh in the out of the gate. But our sweet spot, uh you'll really see that start to kick in over the coming months as we say to people, it's a fun horse race, but it is not a short horse race and it's gonna take some time to really see who the true winners are in the end. Let's talk a little bit more about that race. I mentioned it in my intro, Franklin Templeton has the lowest fees at 0.19%. I believe you lowered fees again after the approval of the ETF, what went in to making that decision? Do you really see, uh, the fees being a competitive advantage for you as you move forward? I think fees are always important to think about, not because they're important to the asset manager, but because they're important to the client, right? And we aren't looking at the spot. Bitcoin ETF is kind of an asset gathering opportunity. We're looking at it as an investment opportunity. And so we want our investors, particularly those who reward us with their trust in coming early into the fund to get the full benefit of that. And we decided that we're in this for the long haul. We have already multi coin portfolios that we're trading in separately managed accounts. We have the first ever uh us public mutual fund on Blockchain. We, we have many products that we're looking to push and the Bitcoin is a exciting new one and we want our investors to get 100% of the benefit of that out of the gate. So we really decided to suspending the fees until we got to 10 billion A. Um Or until we got to the first through the first six months was the way to really reward those who went on this journey with us. You just mentioned a few different types of digital asset products. Um Are you seeing new clients come to Franklin Templeton for these offerings or are your existing clients? Um you know, are they excited about these products or is there kind of a an educational gap that the firm is trying to fill for them? Well, we have a whole range, right? So there's been clients that have been on this digital asset journey with us from day one. You know, we run our own nodes, we're on five different public blockchains. We're really working um across many of the crypto natives and with many of the crypto natives in the space and there's been a crypto native audience that's been investing with us for many years now. Uh Then there's been a set of investors who are investing with our venture capital fund who are inventing investing uh through some of our separately managed accounts. Um But it's the newest audience that we're excited to be accessing, which is the more everyday investor that hasn't had this opportunity or, you know, the real technical know how to get into the space. So I think you're finding different audiences have different levels of excitement and it's this newest audience that really has been probably watching but not really feeling comfortable getting into digital assets uh that we think are the most excited about this opportunity. I want to talk about that new audience and come back to the Twitter. Uh There's been some buzz around Solana. I know Franklin Templeton has been tweeting about different ecosystems, different layer ones, Ethereum and Solana being two of them in the last week. Does that mean that investors can expect products that might give them exposure to these two assets or are you maybe thinking about a Solana ETF in the future? Well, we, we have our own investment research team that does research on individual coins and, and certainly both Ethereum and Salana are coins where we co we have coverage, we have our own price forecasts and targets. Uh We talk with our investors about what our research is showing us. Uh And so it feels natural that over time our ETF uh ecosystem will expand. Uh but I can't comment on any specific timing on any of that. But you know, this, it makes sense to think about this as a portfolio of ETF S and opportunities, not just a single Bitcoin portfolio. OK, Sandy, I have to ask you the last time you and I spoke was at consensus 2023 and we're talking about music and culture as digital assets that folks could invest in any progress there uh from the firm's perspective or has the focus really been on getting this ETF off the ground? Well, we have different teams working uh on different initiatives within the group and I could say that we're starting to make some very interesting partnership decisions uh that will hopefully allow us to have some progress on these cultural assets. And this idea that you can own a growing set of assets by using the tokenization wrapper uh and embedding the utilization uh rights and the benefits and the rewards. Uh And we're starting to experiment this with this even within our own organization uh for our conferences. Now that our digital asset team helps to support we're issuing NFTS for those conferences and those NFTS are giving access to the research, uh the proprietary research that we're publishing. So that's our first step on this journey in starting to bring smart contracts into our ecosystem. And we continue to expect that to evolve and grow over time. Our audience might not have been a consensus 2023 last year. So just explain to us a little bit about how Franklin Templeton is thinking about music specifically as a, as a digital asset, as an investable asset for uh investors who are working with your firm. Yeah, I mean, music is a fantastic example, Jen, because when you think about it, you know, royalties are a wonderful cash income stream, right? You know that the songs are gonna be played. Uh you know that the artist has a body of work that keeps their uh fans interested. And it it's a great way to add an income stream to a portfolio, but it's very hard to think about administering a re a royalty pool across millions of investors, right? It's just operationally too difficult to do uh in today's world. But once you start moving into the world of smart contracts, and you start to be able uh to really programmatically split up that pool of royalties into small small fractional shares and have that automatically administered by the algorithms. All of a sudden those royalty pools become amazing sources of potential return. And so this is something we want to unlock for our clients. We think that music are digital, um you know, collectibles. These are all things that people have always put money into for investment purposes, but they haven't been able to wrap them into a portfolio. Uh and therefore you're not getting the risk benefit, the diversification benefit. And we think that this is really going to change in the next few years and we really want to be at the forefront of that. OK. And Sandy, just before we wrap, we've been talking to all the asset managers, your peers who have been approved for a spot. Bitcoin ETF many of them come from the traditional finance world if you were to look forward, uh paint a picture for me, what does the future look like with traditional finance firms, interacting with crypto and vice versa? That's been the most uh I think enjoyable and exciting part of what's been happening in the last few months, Jen is that I think we're finally starting to see the two sides come together, right? The innovation, the creativity, the willingness to push the boundaries and find new business models that the crypto natives represent, um which is just not coming in many instances from the traditional investment side. And yet the comfortableness working with regulators, the understanding of investor protections, uh the thinking about the total portfolio and how that comes together from a risk management and a volatility perspective. That's the real strengths that traditional investment managers bring to the table. So combining uh these innovations with these uh traditional values that have really worked over decades. I mean, Franklin Templeton is 76 years old. Um That's what's so exciting to me. That's really what opens up the potential of the future and it's all to the benefit of our investors. And that's what, you know, all of us in this industry are the most focused on and we're the most excited about Sandy. It's been such a pleasure chatting to you. Thanks so much for joining the show. Thank you so much for having me. That was head of strategy for Franklin Templeton's Digital Asset unit. Sandy K. That's a wrap for first mover. We hope you have a Happy Happy Friday and we'll see you again on Monday morning. Thank you so much for watching this week and thank you to our guests today, Robbie Michnik and Sandy call as a note, interviews are sometimes edited on first mover for clarity and consistency.

ETH reached its highest price since May 2022 following the approval of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. last week. Several of the firms behind BTC ETFs, such as BlackRock and VanEck, are plotting similar products for ETH, Coinbase said in a weekly newsletter. Aside from ETF hopes, Ethereum's upcoming Dencun upgrade, which aims to improve the mainnet's scalability, could galvanize investor interest in ETH.

        "content": "Michael Sonnenshein at the 2022 Forbes Iconoclast Summit at New York Historical Society on Nov. 3, 2022.\n\nWhen the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a swathe of spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, much focus was on the management fees that firms from BlackRock to Fidelity were charging.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF is the world's largest, with over $25 billion in assets under management.\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein told CNBC that most of the approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds won't survive, while defending the highest fees in the market for the company's own product.\n\nMany of the ETF issuers were charging 0% fees for a limited amount of time before raising them slightly. Most of the approved ETFs have fees of between 0.2% and 0.4%.\n\nBut the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF charges a 1.5% fee.\n\nSonnenshein laid out several reasons why it is charging that fee, including the fact it is the largest bitcoin fund, has a 10-year track record of \"operating successfully\" and has a diversified investor base.\n\n\"Investors are weighing heavily things like liquidity and track record and who the actual issuer is behind the product. Grayscale is a crypto specialist. And it has really paved the way for a lot of these products coming through,\" Sonnenshein told CNBC in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.\n\nSonnenshein said the reason other ETFs have lower fees is that the products \"don't have a track record\" and the issuers are trying to attract investors with fee incentives.\n\n\"I think from our standpoint, it may at times call into question their long-term commitment to the asset class,\" Sonnenshein said.\n\nThe Grayscale CEO said two to three of the spot Bitcoin ETFs \"will maybe obtain some kind of critical mass\" of assets under management, but that the others may be pulled from the market.\n\n\"I don't ultimately think that the marketplace will have ultimately these 11 spot products we find ourselves having,\" Sonnenshein said."

        "title": "'Vanguard Is Not Your Mother': Ric Edelman Excoriates Bitcoin ETF Holdout - ThinkAdvisor",
        "content": "What You Need to Know Vanguard shouldn't tell customers they can't invest in bitcoin ETFs, Edelman said.\n\nThe fund giant will eventually offer the ETFs, the crypto advocate predicted.\n\nGrayscale's higher fee is rude to those who own it, he said.\n\nDigital Assets Council of Financial Professionals founder Ric Edelman, while celebrating the recent U.S. regulatory green light for 11 spot bitcoin ETFs, blasted fund giant Vanguard Group and scolded crypto asset manager Grayscale over their approaches to the new securities.\n\nIn his podcast, The Truth About Your Future, Edelman scorched Vanguard this week for its \u201cobnoxious\u201d and \u201cpatriarchal\u201d decision to bar clients from purchasing crypto assets, including the new bitcoin ETFs, on its platform, and urged a boycott.\n\nAnd while crediting Grayscale for its prominent role in making spot bitcoin ETFs a reality, he knocked the firm for the 1.5% annual fee on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), which the firm converted from a closed-end fund structure to a spot bitcoin ETF when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the new funds last week.\n\nThe crypto advocate predicted Vanguard will eventually offer the bitcoin ETFs, which the asset manager has said don\u2019t align with its views on well-balanced, long-term portfolios.\n\n\u2018Vanguard Is Not Your Mother\u2019\n\n\u201cThat is beyond ridiculous. Vanguard offers nearly 400 mutual funds and ETFs. It offers thousands more that are sponsored by other fund companies. On Vanguard\u2019s platform, you can buy dozens of mutual funds and ETFs that Vanguard itself says are of the highest risk of all investments \u2014 commodities funds, emerging markets funds, gold funds,\u201d he said, according to the Tuesday podcast\u2019s transcript.\n\n\u201cApparently, Vanguard doesn\u2019t know that the SEC has ruled that bitcoin is a commodity. So if Vanguard offers other commodities ETFs, why not this commodity ETF? And apparently Vanguard doesn\u2019t really understand what a well-balanced long-term portfolio really is. How can you build a well-balanced portfolio if you\u2019re excluding some assets that help you balance out the risks of the portfolio?\u201d Edelman asked.\n\n\u201cVanguard obviously needs a course in modern portfolio theory, the Nobel Prize-winning investment management methodology that virtually every financial advisor adheres to. When you add a risky asset to a diversified portfolio, you actually lower the risk of the overall portfolio while increasing returns. Doesn\u2019t Vanguard know this?\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cHow can Vanguard say that bitcoin isn\u2019t a solid long-term investment? Would Vanguard have preferred that you buy Kodak, which was a 150-year-old company but then went bankrupt, or Blockbuster Video that got wiped out by Netflix? How can Vanguard claim that it knows which investments are the right ones for the long term?\u201d Edelman asked.\n\nHe seemed to accuse the company of helicopter parenting.\n\n\u201cWho the hell is Vanguard to make that decision for you in the first place anyway? Vanguard is not your mother. They don\u2019t get to tell you what to do. Their job is to make available all the investments that are permitted by the SEC. \u2026 It\u2019s for Vanguard to put them on their platform and then let the investor and the investment advisor decide, just like they decide about all of the other thousands of funds that are on Vanguard\u2019s platform.\u201d\n\nInvestors aren\u2019t hiring Vanguard to tell them what they can and can\u2019t do, Edelman continued.\n\n\u201cThis is an obnoxious, arrogant and highly inappropriate patriarchal decision by Vanguard, and it\u2019s going to cost them a lot of customers and a lot of business. Already, social media is filled with investors who are complaining about this, and they\u2019re busy transferring their accounts from Vanguard to Schwab, where you can buy all 11 of these spot bitcoin ETFs on Schwab.com,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoycott Vanguard, transfer your assets tax-free and fee-free to someone else. That will give you the access to the bitcoin ETFs that you want. Schwab is a good choice. It\u2019s not the only choice, it\u2019s a good one. And lots of financial advisors are also ready to help you, but not those who custody at Vanguard,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nWells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Citi are letting their investors trade the new bitcoin ETFs, he added, calling Vanguard \u201ccrazy\u201d and out of step with the financial services industry.\n\nHe predicted Vanguard will change course.\n\n\u201cFive years from now, they will have crypto ETFs and they will allow their customers to buy all the ETF products. But they\u2019re going to be very late to the party. And their customers who sit with them and wait are going to miss out on the massive opportunities they currently have to reduce overall portfolio risks and enhance overall portfolio returns,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cShame on Vanguard.\u201d\n\nNo Reason to Pay Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Fee\n\nAs for Grayscale, Edelman praised its work to win regulatory approval for spot bitcoin ETFs but criticzed its comparatively high fee and the effect on longtime holders.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s popular closed-end trust, once one of the few vehicles for bitcoin exposure other than directly buying the digital coins, became the largest spot bitcoin ETF, with $26 billon in assets under management, upon conversion. It lowered its fee from 2% to 1.5%, a rate significantly higher than competitors.\n\n\u201cWe are all deeply grateful to Grayscale for its leadership. It was their lawsuit against the SEC that is directly responsible for the SEC finally granting approval of these bitcoin ETFs, and the SEC didn\u2019t just say yes to GBTC. \u2026 The SEC said yes to 11 of these ETFs,\u201d Edelman said.\n\n\u201cThis is wonderful because it creates market competition that helps to lower the prices for everybody. But it also creates a bit of work for you as an advisor or as an investor, because now you\u2019ve got to evaluate all 11 of them, and you\u2019ve got to decide which ones you want to use. So while I say thanks to Grayscale for making all this happen \u2026 I have to say to Grayscale your GBTC, your bitcoin ETF sucks.\u201d\n\nFor years, Grayscale was the only game in town, Edelman said, noting he\u2019s owned it a long time and has \u201cmade a ton of money on it.\u201d He didn\u2019t mind the fee because he expected big profits and there wasn\u2019t much choice.\n\n\u201cBut now GBTC is an ETF among 11 ETFs, and there\u2019s simply no reason to pay 1.5% per year. Not one,\u201d he said.\n\nFranklin Templeton, Bitwise, Fidelity, Invesco and others are charging zero for six months to a year, and even after that time period, the ETFs are \u201cfree,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir fee will be a fraction of GBTC\u2019s fee. Franklin Templeton is just 0.19%, Bitwise is 0.2%. Blackrock and Fidelity are 0.25%,\u201d he said.\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein \u201cknows that the overwhelming majority of people who own GBTC are going to keep it,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cThey\u2019re either too dumb to know that they\u2019re paying an outrageous fee, or they\u2019re too lazy to do anything about it, or they don\u2019t want to sell it and incur the taxes on their profits. He\u2019s right. I bet that he\u2019ll keep almost all the AUM in that fund. He might not attract much more in new assets.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF rush spells uncertain future for Grayscale - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter. Today we\u2019re taking a look at what comes next for Grayscale\u2019s new bitcoin ETF.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following my ETF coverage this week you\u2019ll know the collective launch of the US\u2019s newly approved league of bitcoin exchange traded funds has been broadly underwhelming.\n\nAccording to data from CoinShares, net flows into the 11 funds totalled less than $900mn in the first three days of trading, although that figure ticked above $1bn by close of business on Thursday.\n\nQuestions linger for this new world. For a start, bitcoin\u2019s price has fallen 9.2 per cent since the ETFs got the green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 hardly the boost some had hoped for.\n\nStill, it is early days. Right now, one of the biggest topics is the future of the Grayscale bitcoin ETF. Unlike the others, Grayscale has been running a bitcoin trust for several years: a closed end fund where investors could not retrieve their coins, but only sell shares in the trust over-the-counter, and often at a large discount to the price of bitcoin.\n\nIt built up more than $28bn in assets under management (AuM) before Grayscale was allowed to convert the trust to an ETF, alongside the launch of 10 new competitors. The company scored a landmark legal victory over the SEC in August, which paved the way for the regulator\u2019s eventual reversal of a decade-long policy of rejecting spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAccording to data from crypto investment group CoinShares, $2.2bn has flowed out of Grayscale\u2019s fund since it started trading last week as of close of business on Thursday.\n\nTo be fair, the scale of Grayscale\u2019s holdings can lose plenty of assets before it feels competitors snapping at its heels. Still, I asked Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale\u2019s chief executive, what those outflows mean for his new fund. He was unfazed, choosing instead to emphasise Grayscale\u2019s longstanding record in a market where BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark, Bitwise and the rest are newcomers.\n\n\u201c[For many investors] it not only resonates that they\u2019re invested in a fund that is large, liquid and has a track record, but that it is also being provided to them by a company that is a specialist\u2026a lot of these other asset managers are really getting to crypto for the first time,\u201d he said, adding \u201cto be clear, they\u2019re coming to market to compete with us\u201d.\n\nHe played up Grayscale\u2019s role in forging a path for bitcoin investment that others had now followed, adding that eventually he expects a \u201crising tide will lift all boats\u201d.\n\nYet no matter how brave a face Sonnenshein puts on, the fact remains Grayscale\u2019s new ETF has haemorrhaged well over $2bn in assets in just one week of trading. In contrast, BlackRock \u2014 the largest asset manager in the world \u2014 has pulled in $1.2bn since launch.\n\nBidding to change its investment trust to an ETF was always a risky game for Grayscale, given the rush of new competition would be likely to spark a price war.\n\n\u201cWe always knew that pushing for an ETF could damage [Grayscale\u2019s] business strategy,\u201d said CoinShares\u2019 head of research James Butterfill. \u201cUltimately, they\u2019ve been sitting on a closed end fund and charging expensive fees. Moving to an ETF liberalises the market.\u201d\n\nGrayscale is sticking with its fee plan for now, even though it lowered its annual management charge to a 1.5 per cent fee, from 2 per cent, in the run-up to launch.\n\nBlackRock, for example, charges just 0.12 per cent for the present, although that will rise to 0.25 per cent in the next year or if it attracts $5bn in AuM.\n\n\u201cThere is no current discussion about [further reducing fees],\u201d Sonnenshein added. \u201cWe made a commitment to investors to lower fees and we honoured that commitment.\u201d\n\nHe will be hoping that commitment \u2014 alongside Grayscale\u2019s much-trumpeted record \u2014 will be enough to persuade the rest of his investors to hang around for longer.\n\nSome analysts are less optimistic.\n\n\u201cCompetition on fees is causing investors to exit Grayscale and shift to alternative ETF products,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive at investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management.\n\nBut if the first week of trading is anything to go by, my analysis last September is proving to be right so far: Grayscale opened the door to Wall Street with its SEC victory, and now bigger names are marching in and eating Sonnenshein\u2019s dinner.\n\n\u201cThey started off as this 800lb gorilla, but now they\u2019re facing stiff competition,\u201d said Jim Angel, professor at Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re playing a wait and see game but it\u2019s a difficult position to be in, if they keep fees too high their assets will fly out the door.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Grayscale\u2019s future in the ETF sector? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights:\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of bitcoin ETFs, make sure you don\u2019t miss last weekend\u2019s piece where Nikou Asgari and I looked at why bitcoin\u2019s Wall Street takeover has frustrated the sector\u2019s true believers. Those who bought into Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original message hoped bitcoin would champion a libertarian alternative to mainstream finance, but instead, the newly approved ETF class of 2024 cements the coin as merely a vehicle for speculation.\n\nJudge Jed Rakoff this week pushed the trial of Do Kwon \u2014 the mind behind the failed TerraUSD stablecoin that kickstarted crypto\u2019s 2022 market crisis \u2014 to March 25 2024. The disgraced crypto kingpin was charged by US prosecutors with eight criminal counts including securities, commodities and wire fraud after his arrest in Montenegro last year, and is awaiting an anticipated extradition to the US.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Scams supercharged by crypto\n\nMoney laundering via black market casinos of south-east Asia is hardly new. But a UN report this week shed a new angle on it.\n\nCrypto, and the stablecoin Tether in particular, has helped give the underground sector a new lease of life, says Jeremy Douglas, a regional representative of the UN\u2019s Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\n\u201cOrganised crime has effectively created a parallel banking system using new technologies, and the proliferation of loosely or entirely unregulated online casinos together with crypto has supercharged the region\u2019s criminal ecosystem.\u201d\n\nData mining: Another (un)stable coin\n\nFor products that pledge 24/7 stability, stablecoins fail all too often in this sector. We\u2019ve seen it variously with Tether, Circle\u2019s USDC and most dramatically, with the Terra stablecoin that kicked off the market collapse of 2022.\n\nThis week there was another: the TUSD stablecoin. It was issued by a company called TrustToken in 2018 and was once considered a potential rival to the stablecoin market giants Tether and Circle. Now it is the fifth-largest stablecoin, which in market terms, is far behind.\n\nThis week it fell off its peg to the US dollar, trading as low as 97 cents. It has since recovered to 98 cents, but not regained its peg.\n\nThe TUSD team took to Twitter to dismiss the peg break as a short-term arbitrage opportunity, going on to describe the event as a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments\u201d. OK.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford. Please send any thoughts and feedback to cryptofinance@ft.com."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs have been out for a week\u2014here's how they're doing - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Happy Friday. The crypto industry spent months pinning its hopes on the long-awaited arrival of Bitcoin ETFs, which would help it break out of a painful bear market and let digital assets take their rightful place in the world of mainstream finance. Those ETFs finally arrived last Thursday. So were they a success? An initial flurry of marketing spin made it hard to tell, but now some clear signals are emerging.\n\nOn the price front, Bitcoin has actually slumped significantly since the launch, but that doesn't mean the ETFs have been a flop. The slump follows a wild run-up in crypto prices that came in anticipation the SEC would approve the new product, so the recent drop reflects an expected \"sell the news\" moment. Meanwhile, the market for Bitcoin ETFs is already reportedly more valuable than the one for silver with BlackRock's ETF already pulling in more than $1 billion on its own.\n\nMore intriguing is what comes next. I spoke with Ophelia Snyder, whose 21.co helped stand up Ark Invest's Bitcoin ETF, which was fourth of the 11 new ETFs with $2.7 million of trading volume on Thursday, to get a better sense of where things are going. She made the case that much of the early movement is from organic retail trading and that the market can expect a lot more inflows once financial advisors start recommending Bitcoin ETFs to their clients.\n\nAccording to Snyder, these advisors are currently able to pick up the phone and fill a customer's order for Bitcoin shares but need to assess the market before actively putting them in portfolios. She expects that to happen in the coming weeks and months, which will drive up demand\u2014and of course the price. Snyder is obviously not impartial here but her thesis makes sense.\n\nAnother thing that's becoming apparent one week into Bitcoin ETF trading is which of the 11 newly launched ETFs are gaining significant market share. While assets under management tell part of the story, that metric can also be misleading since some of the funds' size reflects, in Snyder's words, a \"bring your own assets\" playbook\u2014meaning they drew on their own capital to help juice their launches. That's the case with category leaders BlackRock and Fidelity and with BitWise, which launched with a \"seed partner\" that invested heavily.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe better way to assess the new ETFs' early performance is by daily trading volume and, on that front, BlackRock and Fidelity are also way out front with volumes of $17.7 million and $9.7 million on Thursday. BitWise was next with $2.8 million, just ahead of Ark. Meanwhile, the other new ETFs (aside from Grayscale, which is a special case) posted less than 10% of those volumes, raising questions about their long-term viability.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that the long-awaited Bitcoin ETFs are an initial success, and, if optimists like Snyder are right, this is just the beginning.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "title": "Here Come the Million-Dollar Price Targets for Bitcoin. Should We Believe Any of Them? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Due to all the bullish enthusiasm around Bitcoin (BTC -4.56%) and the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, it's unsurprising that we're starting to see some very aggressive price estimates for Bitcoin. The one that is getting all the attention, of course, is the new $1.5 million forecast from Cathie Wood and Ark Invest.\n\nWhile $1.5 million might sound like an impossibly high pie-in-the-sky number for a single cryptocurrency token, you'd be surprised at how easy it is to find million-dollar price estimates for Bitcoin. In fact, you can find $10 million, $100 million, and even $1 billion forecasts for Bitcoin. So, just how realistic are any of these price estimates?\n\nPast results are no guarantee of future performance\n\nThe most common approach for coming up with a $1 million price target, quite simply, is to look at how Bitcoin has behaved in the past and then extrapolate how it might behave in the future. Once you examine the price history of Bitcoin, you'll quickly see how easy this is. For example, it took Bitcoin approximately six months to 10x in value from $1 to $10, another six months to 10x from $10 to $100, and another six months to 10x from $100 to $1,000.\n\nSo, you can see where I'm going with this. If you rely entirely on past performance, you could fall into the trap of assuming Bitcoin can routinely increase in price by 10x every six months or so. At a current price of $50,000, that gets you to a price of $500,000 by mid-2024. If you assume Bitcoin can double in price over the following six months, then voil\u00e0! You've arrived at $1 million in Bitcoin by the end of the year. Congratulations!\n\nThere are different variants of this approach, of course. One of them involves considering the halving, a blockchain-specific event that occurs only once every four years. As a result of this halving, Bitcoin tends to skyrocket in value. If you examine the history of three previous halving events and assume Bitcoin will perform similarly after the next halving event (scheduled for April), you can come up with some dizzying price assumptions for Bitcoin.\n\nMarket sizing comparisons\n\nAnother approach to creating a $1 million price for Bitcoin involves market sizing comparisons. By comparing the value of Bitcoin to the value of another well-known financial asset, you can come up with some pretty impressive numbers.\n\nFor example, since Bitcoin is often referred to as \"digital gold,\" it could make sense to compare the market value of Bitcoin (currently around $1 trillion) to the value of all the physical gold in the world (which is about $13.7 trillion). If you buy into the argument that \"digital gold\" will eventually crowd out \"physical gold\" as a store of value, then you've found a very clever way to show that the value of Bitcoin could increase by a factor of anywhere from 10x to 15x. That gets you to a $500,000 price for Bitcoin pretty quickly.\n\nBut do the numbers make sense?\n\nMy concern is that, at some point, the numbers stop making sense. For example, given the current circulating coin supply of 20 million for Bitcoin, a target price of $1 million assumes a market valuation of $20 trillion for Bitcoin.\n\nBut think about that number for a second. That $20 trillion is nearly 7x the market cap of the world's most valuable publicly traded company (Microsoft or Apple, take your pick). It's approximately equal to the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States. And it's roughly half the combined value of the S&P 500, now estimated at $40 trillion.\n\nIn short, a $20 trillion valuation for Bitcoin is possible only if there is a huge shock of some kind to the entire U.S. economy. Unfortunately, that probably means a market crash of some kind. In such a scenario, money would presumably flow out of dollar-denominated financial assets and into Bitcoin very rapidly.\n\nCathie Wood's $1.5 million price forecast\n\nWith all credit to Cathie Wood, I think she has the best $1 million valuation model for Bitcoin. It's based on looking at Bitcoin's use cases, extrapolating future growth prospects, and then aggregating the values of these different use cases. And the math behind the model is completely transparent and publicly available, so you can check the numbers yourself.\n\nThat said, I have a hard time seeing Bitcoin hitting $1 million anytime soon. Sure, Bitcoin might be trading around $1 million sometime within the next decade. But just be careful about listening to anyone who tells you that the price of Bitcoin is skyrocketing to $1 million in 2024 simply because Wall Street now has Bitcoin ETFs to sell you."

        "content": "Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar; BlackRock Fund Passes $1 Bln\n\nNewly-minted spot bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.33 billion in their first five days of trading, as investors enthusiastically embraced the funds after more than a decade of approval delays from regulators concerned about cryptocurrency\u2019s vulnerability to fraud.\n\nAt the same time, the funds largely declined over the past 5 days in tandem with the price of bitcoin. Over the same period, broad market exchange traded funds such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) jumped in price.\n\nThe biggest spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), struggled. The fund, which came to market as a $28.6 billion trust, lost $5.5 billion, or 19% of its value, according to Bloomberg data, likely due to fees that are the highest among the 11 spot bitcoin funds approved Jan. 11.\n\nBlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity\n\nStill, the launch of the investment vehicles appear in their early days to be a rousing success. The funds\u2019 total market capitalization, excluding the Grayscale fund, climbed to $3.25 billion, surpassing silver to become the second largest commodity ETF in the U.S. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the group, pulling in $1.2 billion since Jan. 11, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) has grabbed $1.06 billion. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) brought in $393.8 million, the third-most.\n\nName recognition helped BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest ETF issuer, as well as Fidelity, grab the most investor money, etf.com senior analyst Sumit Roy said. Bitwise, a far smaller and lesser-known issuer, has performed well with its BITB fund due to a decision to go to market as a low-fee fund, he said.\n\n\u201cAt nearly $400 million, BITB is punching well above its weight thanks to its category-low expense ratio,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, the inflows for the ETFs from VanEck and WisdomTree have been a disappointment.\u201d\n\nRoy noted that by comparison, precious metals ETFs, commodity funds which have been around for decades, had $120 million in outflows over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the SEC has allowed ETFs that track bitcoin futures since 2021, it only approved the investment vehicles that give investors exposure to physically backed bitcoin last week after months of anticipation from eager cryptocurrency investors.\n\nThe funds are seeing massive inflows despite a number of major asset manager, including Vanguard, refusing to let investors trade the funds with them. During etf.com\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF webinar, chief investment officer of Bitwise Matt Hougan said he wasn\u2019t surprised, but expected the ETFs to be more widely adopted by traditional finance platforms soon.\n\n\"I would be surprised if there will be firms still holding out after a year because these businesses are responsive to their customers, and people are already clamoring to request access to trade bitcoin ETFs,\u201d he said.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "content": "Hong Kong-based financial services firm Venture Smart Financial Holdings Limited is planning to launch its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund within the first quarter, setting a target of $500 million in assets under management by the year-end, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe company, which claims to be Hong Kong's first approved virtual asset manager, has yet to place an ETF application with the Securities and Futures Commission, the city\u2019s financial regulator.\n\nIn December, the SFC announced that the city was ready to accept applications for spot crypto ETFs, along with two circulars that addressed the requirements for launching such products. The region rolled out its crypto licensing regime for crypto trading platforms in June 2023 in hopes of reclaiming its position as Asia\u2019s crypto hub. Three crypto futures ETFs are already listed in Hong Kong \u2014 Samsung Bitcoin BTC -7.04% Futures, CSOP Bitcoin Futures and CSOP Ether Futures.\n\nEarlier this month, Livio Weng, chief operating officer of Hong Kong crypto exchange HashKey, said that around ten fund companies in the region have started to explore the option to launch spot crypto ETFs.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nFollowing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Jan. 10 approval, the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have seen over $13 billion in cumulative trading volume so far. However, the price of bitcoin slipped as the enthusiasm surrounding the approval withered, trading around $41,250 as of publication time.\n\nVSFG did not immediately respond to The Block\u2019s request for further comments."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin surges past silver, becoming second-largest commodity ETF\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust transformation fuels ETF market boom\n\nInvestors embrace new Bitcoin ETFs with enthusiasm, driving high trading volumes\n\nBitcoin has overtaken silver to become the second-largest commodity in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in terms of assets under management (AUM).\n\nBitcoin ETFs reached the milestone within a week of commencing trade. This move suggests a swift and substantial accumulation of investor interest and capital in the cryptocurrency.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Transformation Boosts Bitcoin ETF Market\n\nThe recent surge in the Bitcoin ETF market is largely attributed to Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust converting into an ETF. This move not only established the largest Bitcoin ETF but also enhanced market liquidity. Grayscale now leads spot Bitcoin ETFs with approximately 647,651 BTC, amounting to $27.5 billion AUM .\n\nThis upsurge in Bitcoin ETFs has subsequently relegated silver to third place in the single commodity ETF asset class . Silver ETFs currently manage around $11.5 billion in AUM, spread across five funds. Meanwhile, gold continues to dominate, with $96.3 billion AUM distributed across 19 different ETFs.\n\nBitfinex\u2019s Head of Derivatives, Jag Kooner told CCN that Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded Silver ETFs in the US in terms of size, driven by the substantial market interest they have received.\n\nHe explained:\n\n\u201cGrayscale\u2019s conversion of its existing Bitcoin trust into an ETF, created the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin ETF overnight, boasting over $29 billion in AUM. The level of trading activity we have since seen in the new Bitcoin ETFs reflect the pent-up demand for these products, and we expect that it will lead to increased liquidity and stability in the market.\u201d\n\nHe added the company expects that there will continue to be strong interest.\n\n\u201cThe ETF issuers have implemented competitive fee structures, featuring a range of discounted fees and fee waivers which should attract more investors and could lead to further competitive pricing among ETF providers. While some in the investment community still view cryptocurrencies as risky, the growth of these ETFs could pave the way for more innovative crypto ETFs and new underlyings such as Ether,\u201d Kooner concluded.\n\nEnthusiastic Market Embraces New Bitcoin ETFs with High Trading Volumes\n\nBitcoin ETFs have been met with a positive response from the market. In a just five days, the combined trading volume of the 11 Bitcoin ETF funds exceeded $12 billion. Analysts attribute this to a mix of strong investor demand and competitive fee structures offered by the ETF issuers. These elements are drawing in investors, contributing to improved market liquidity and stability.\n\nFurther emphasizing this trend, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst, pointed out the performance of Bitcoin ETFs in one-week flow comparisons with all ETFs. Notably, two Bitcoin ETFs ranked in the top five and three in the top 10, competing with well-established ETFs like $VOO and $QQQ. This indicates growing investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin as a viable investment option.\n\nAnother way to put the bitcoin ETF flows in ETF context (besides showing their #s relative to past new launches) is how they stack up to ALL ETFs in past 1 week flows. Even after four days two of them are in Top 5 and three in Top 10, up there w the studs $VOO , $QQQ et al. pic.twitter.com/oduhktEqwG \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 18, 2024\n\nGold\u2019s Price Surge Still Reflects Complex Market Dynamics\n\nGold prices have recently shown a significant upward trend , reaching an all-time high of over $2,100 per ounce on December 4, 2023. This was been driven by a mix of factors, including a weaker dollar and speculation about the Federal Reserve\u2019s reluctance to maintain aggressive rate hikes.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which measures the dollar\u2019s value against other major currencies, has fallen more than 3% since early October. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, have played a role in boosting gold\u2019s value.\n\nThe World Gold Council (WGC) has reported strong demand for gold , especially from central banks. In the first nine months of 2023, central banks purchased a record 800 tons, a substantial portion of the total demand. This buying streak is expected to continue for the remainder of the year. China and India are the two biggest gold buyers, accounting for more than half of global demand.\n\nBitcoin vs. Gold ETFs: Navigating the Duality of Volatility and Stability\n\nAs we progress through 2024, both Bitcoin and gold ETFs are witnessing pivotal moments. Bitcoin ETFs are at the forefront of reshaping the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, gold ETFs maintain their significant status in traditional investment strategies.\n\nThe decision between investing in Bitcoin or gold ETFs largely hinges on individual investor preferences and risk tolerance. Gold ETFs offer a more conventional and stable investment, anchored to a tangible commodity. On the other hand, Bitcoin ETFs present an opportunity to engage with a more volatile, yet potentially high-return digital asset. This choice epitomizes the diversified and evolving nature of today\u2019s investment landscape.\n\nIn 2004, the first gold ETF launched in the US. 20 years later, it\u2019s #Bitcoin \u2019s turn. pic.twitter.com/qkxdhZ0Wo9 \u2014 Binance (@binance) January 14, 2024\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s crucial for investors to thoroughly understand the inherent volatility and uncertainties associated with these markets before committing to substantial investments."

        "title": "When is the next Bitcoin halving? Everything you need to know - Finextra",
        "content": "The next Bitcoin halving is just around the corner, which will have significant impact on not just the Bitcoin price but the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. We detail everything you need do know about the Bitcoin halving date and the wider impact of the upcoming halving event.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin relies on blockchain technology to securely function. As part of this, Bitcoin mining refers to the distributed consensus system that confirms pending transactions by including them in the blockchain in chronological order. Transactions are subject to strict cryptographic rules, which are verified by the system, as they are packed in blocks to be added to the chain. This ensures security of the network because it\u2019s not possible to modify previous blocks without invalidating the entire chain of subsequent blocks.\n\nThe halving policy was written into Bitcoin\u2019s mining algorithm in an attempt to counteract inflation by maintaining scarcity. The Bitcoin code dictates that the reward for miners is reduced by half after every 210,000 blocks are created, which is the event we call a Bitcoin halving. As long as demand for Bitcoin remains the same, the Bitcoin halving, in theory, will lead to an increase in price.\n\nBitcoin halving date\n\nBlocks of transactions are added approximately every 10 minutes, which means that the Bitcoin halving cycle is roughly four years. The next Bitcoin halving is due to occur in 2024, with current date estimates and Bitcoin halving countdowns estimating the exact date to be April 17th, 2024.\n\nHow many Bitcoin halvings have there been?\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency created and was officially launched in January of 2009. Since then, there have been three historical Bitcoin halvings which have reduced the reward for miners. The initial reward in 2009 was 50 BTC, which would be worth over \u00a31,000,000 today. At the moment, pre-2024 halving, the mining reward stands at 6.25BTC, which is approximately \u00a3224,693.\n\nBitcoin halving price chart:\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nSource: Techopedia\n\n\n\n2024 Bitcoin halving price prediction\n\nAfter the 2024 halving, the reward for miners will stand at 3.125 BTC. Designed to maintain scarcity, Bitcoin halvings generally led to an increase in Bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cHistorically, there is a lot of Bitcoin price volatility leading up to and after a halving event. However, the price of Bitcoin typically ends up significantly higher a few months after,\u201d comments Rob Chang, CEO of Gryphon Digital Mining.\n\nWhile the first halving in 2012 did not have a significant impact on Bitcoin prices due to the cryptocurrency\u2019s infancy, the second halving in 2016 led to a 194% increase in Bitcoin prices, and the third having in 2020 increased prices by 100%.\n\nMarket uncertainty in 2023, combined with the shockwaves caused by the collapse of the cryptocurrency platform FTX, make it harder to predict the impact the 2024 Bitcoin halving will have on price. While experts remain cautiously optimistic about a 2024 rebound in crypto investment, the upcoming halving is not a guaranteed catalysts for prices as Bitcoin remain a high-risk asset in a current environment of economic uncertainty.\n\nWhat happens when there is no Bitcoin left to mine?\n\nFrom the get-go, there has been a limit of how many bitcoins will be mined. The maximum number of bitcoins is 21 million, and once that number is reached, no new bitcoins will be issued. Current estimates show that we are likely to reach the 21 million in 2140.\n\nOnce there is no Bitcoin left to mine, miners will no longer receive block rewards and will instead have to rely on transaction fees for compensation. It is likely that once this point is reached, Bitcoin will become deflationary as coins can be lost through human error, i.e., if a user sends Bitcoin to an invalid address."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has declined by around 10% since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nGrayscale has transferred thousands of Bitcoins to Coinbase to fund ETF redemptions.\n\nSell pressure created by Grayscale\u2019s outflows could cause a further decline in the BTC price.\n\nIn the 7 days since the first spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading on US securities exchanges, the price of Bitcoin has fallen by around 10%. At the same time, investors have pulled hundreds of millions of dollars from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin fund (GBTC) since its conversion to an ETF.\n\nOn Thursday, January 18, when the flight of capital from GBTC outweighed the combined inflows of all 10 other spot bitcoin ETFs. With so much BTC unleashed on the market, selling pressure from Grayscale\u2019s outflows could be a factor in Bitcoin\u2019s recent price collapse.\n\nGrayscale Offloads Thousands of BTC Amid Exodus of Investors\n\nSince Thursday, January 11, when GBTC investors first got the chance to redeem their shares, Grayscale has transferred thousands of Bitcoins to Coinbase to fund the sudden rush of redemptions. In batches of up to 1,000 BTC, the firm has sent a total of 16,712 BTC worth more than $726 million to the crypto exchange so far, data from Arkham Intelligence reveals.\n\nThe \"GBTC dumping send $BTC to sub 30k\" narrative is a weak one when you actually look at the numbers/data. Yea, $GBTC has been selling off with consistent net outflows since the launch of the 9 $BTC ETF's, but the reality is that the inflow to the other 9 ETF's has outweighed\u2026 https://t.co/A23oAQEzTh \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) January 19, 2024\n\nThe largest volume of transfers to Coinbase occurred on Wednesday when Grayscale offloaded 11,712 Bitcoins. As news of the transactions spread, the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply, but the dip was followed by a strong rebound.\n\nIn the long run, however, GBTC redemptions have the potential to drive a more pronounced downtrend.\n\nHow GBTF Outflows Impact the Price of Bitcoin\n\nAlthough significant, transactions related to GBTC redemptions in the last week represent just a small fraction of more than 19.6 million BTC in circulation. They are, therefore, unlikely to be the primary catalyst for the bearish conditions that have characterized the market since last Thursday.\n\nNevertheless, the company still holds over half a million Bitcoins \u2013 more than enough to influence the overall market should outflows continue at their current pace.\n\nAtlascap invest said that in the next 1-2 months, the selling pressure of Grayscale GBTC will directly affect the price of Bitcoin. At this outflow rate, the net outflow of Grayscale GBTC should have no more than two months of impact on Bitcoin price fluctuations. JPMorgan\u2026 https://t.co/qtAmVGzKJX \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 19, 2024\n\nNoting that GBTC redemptions have already released thousands of additional Bitcoins on the market, Atlascap Invest predicts that the selling pressure will directly affect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price in the next 1-2 months.\n\nConsidering that GBTC\u2019s management fees are significantly higher than those charged by its peers, the recent exodus of capital may be driven by investors who plan to relocate to cheaper alternatives. As such, Atlascap anticipates the negative impact of GBTC redemption pressure lasting no more than 2 months. Long term, the firm predicts that demand from other ETFs will ultimately push the price of Bitcoin up."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing strong demand from investors.\n\nBitcoin ETFs are attracting significant capital inflows.\n\nA prominent investor\u2019s sale of large BTC stack on January 12 triggered widespread market panic.\n\nThe newly introduced Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have quickly become a focal point for investors.\n\nOn their fifth trading day, issuers of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) acquired an additional 10,667 Bitcoin. A fall in BTC\u2019s price to $41,434 reflected this.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs Accumulate $440 Million Despite GBTC Outflows\n\nAccording to data from , issuers increased their Bitcoin holdings by a net $440 million by the day\u2019s end. A significant portion of this accumulation, involving 8,700 BTC valued at nearly $358 million, was attributed to BlackRock\u2019s ETF.\n\nFurthermore, the data reveals that since their inception, nine ETFs (excluding Grayscale) have amassed close to 68,500 BTC. This is now worth about $2.8 billion.\n\nThis recent uptick in Bitcoin acquisitions linked to ETFs was balanced by withdrawals from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) . GBTC saw an outflow of 10,824 BTC, worth about $445 million. Since its transformation into a spot ETF on January 11, almost 38,000 BTC has been withdrawn from GBTC.\n\nToday is likely to be a net outflow day for the #bitcoin ETFs.

Normally with a hyped up launch you see volume steadily decrease each day post-launch, rare to see it reverse back up. All but one saw jump too but GBTC change flat so wasn't a volatility\u2026 pic.twitter.com/f6xOsLRWjr \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 18, 2024\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cNormally with a hyped-up launch you see volume steadily decrease each day post-launch, rare to see it reverse back up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider that the data concerning Bitcoin purchases as reported by ETF managers typically lags behind the actual transaction volume figures for each fund. This is mainly due to the time it takes to complete purchase settlements .\n\nReflecting the growing interest of investors in these products, the Bitcoin ETFs managed by BlackRock and Fidelity each amassed more than $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) at close of trading on January 18. This information is based on data provided by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nBitwise Leads in Reporting Bitcoin Holdings with Major Addition\n\nBalchunas also that the Bitcoin ETFs managed by BlackRock and Fidelity have achieved significant prominence in terms of capital inflows. They are currently ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, for weekly capital inflows among all US ETFs. This places them just behind the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF, which replicates the performance of the S&P 500 index, encompassing the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States.\n\nAnother way to put the bitcoin ETF flows in ETF context (besides showing their #s relative to past new launches) is how they stack up to ALL ETFs in past 1 week flows.

On that day, Bitwise added an additional 491 BTC to its portfolio.\n\nBitwise CEO Hunter Horsley expressed gratitude in a tweet, saying, \u201c+$20,000,000 into BITB today.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged the responsibility and trust placed in his company to manage client assets effectively.\n\n+$20,000,000 into BITB today.

However, in the following 24-hour period, the cryptocurrency witnessed a more significant drop , with its value sliding over 3.8% to $41,417.\n\nKey Investor\u2019s BTC Dump Triggered Jan. 12 Price Crash, Analyst Says\n\nAnalyst James Van Straten on the significant drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value on January 12, marking its largest single-day fall since the FTX collapse. He attributed this downturn to the actions of a prominent investor, or \u2018whale,\u2019 who acquired more than 100,000 BTC during the 2021 bull run at approximately $48,000 per Bitcoin.\n\nContrary to Van Straten\u2019s expectations of the investor holding onto their assets due to a 75% unrealized loss, the investor sold their holdings when Bitcoin\u2019s price briefly rose to $49,000 in 2024. This unexpected move triggered widespread market panic, exacerbating the situation with a mix of liquidations, a \u201csell the news\u201d mentality, and record loss-taking among investors.\n\nThis is why (in my opinion) on Jan. 12, #Bitcoin had its largest 1-day drawdown since the FTX collapse and tanked after the ETF started trading. A massive whale that bought in the 2021 bull run at $48k had over 100k BTC and sold at $49K in 2024.

He suggests this volume of sales is insufficient to have caused such a market impact.\n\nFurthermore, he raised doubts about whether FTX has liquidated its GBTC position yet, implying more market movements could be on the horizon if such an event were to happen."

        "title": "100 days out: What the Bitcoin halving means after BTC ETF approvals - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto Twitter has been immersed in the speculation and anticipation of the eventual approval of the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.\n\nAfter some turbulence caused by an alleged fake tweet from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, all 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved.\n\nThe ETF hangover is over, and attention can now shift to the next big event: the Bitcoin halving. The biggest Bitcoin event has less than 100 days to go. The past halvings have directly correlated with Bitcoin\u2019s bull runs, but could the spot Bitcoin ETFs influence the price of BTC in this halving cycle, interfering with short- and long-term Bitcoin price predictions?\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin halving?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years, reducing the rate at which new BTC units are generated and earned by miners in the Bitcoin network. Specifically, miners\u2019 reward for validating and adding new blocks to the blockchain is reduced by half.\n\nThe initial reward started at 50 BTC per block, and after each halving event, it decreased by half. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, reducing the reward to 6.25 BTC per block. The next Bitcoin halving, estimated to occur in mid-April 2024, will reduce the Bitcoin mining rewards to 3.175 BTC per block.\n\nThis process is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol. It is designed to create scarcity, mimicking the scarcity of precious metals like gold. The cryptocurrency community closely watches the halving events, as they impact the overall supply of Bitcoin and can have implications for market dynamics and the value of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin is a relatively young digital asset with a short history. Many fundamental analysts find it hard to provide a precise value due to its novelty and alleged revolutionary factors.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin\u2019s history, the halving has had a consistent effect on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nHalving 2012: Bitcoin is dead\n\nThe first halving occurred on Nov. 28, 2012, and reduced the block reward from 50 to 25 BTC. The price of BTC at the time of the halving was $13, peaking the following year at $1,174.\n\nIn 2012, Bitcoin wasn\u2019t taken too seriously by the mainstream. It was popular among cypherpunks, which nurtured the technology from its infancy. The price of BTC became a marketing tool for the digital asset once it surpassed the benchmark of $1,000, making headlines in the mainstream media.\n\nAs Bitcoin was an unknown intangible asset many didn\u2019t comprehend, it was condemned as dead once the price pulled back to $200. The phrase \u201cBitcoin is dead\u201d would become common in the media in the following years, but the digital asset survived.\n\nHalving 2016: The retail speculation bubble\n\nThe second halving transformed Bitcoin from an underground cryptocurrency into a legitimate asset class. The halving occurred on July 16, 2016, reducing the block reward to 12.5 BTC. The price at the time of the halving was $664; the following year, it peaked at nearly $20,000.\n\nRetail investors jumped into the new wave of altcoins, pushed by the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, which was made possible thanks to the new attributes offered by Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. ICOs flooded the market, but many were incomplete projects, and some were outright scams, bringing much criticism to the crypto market as a whole.\n\nRecent: Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: \u2018Revolutionary change\u2019 or colossal \u2018dud\u2019?\n\nThe rise after this halving was considered a mere retail speculative bubble. However, Pandora\u2019s box had already been opened, and the blockchain industry would emerge from the halving.\n\nHalving 2020: The arrival of smart money\n\nWhen the third halving arrived on May 11, 2020, reducing the block award to 6.25 BTC, BTC was worth $9,734. A new all-time high (ATH) came the following year at $69,045.\n\nThis halving cycle caught the attention of billionaire investors such as Paul Tudor Jones and Michael Saylor, co-founder and then-CEO of software company MicroStrategy.\n\nSaylor became the first CEO to hold Bitcoin on his company\u2019s balance. As the price of BTC surged, MicroStrategy\u2019s stock value rose with it. Saylor\u2019s approach inspired other prominent businessmen, like Elon Musk.\n\nRecent: Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: \u2018Revolutionary change\u2019 or colossal \u2018dud\u2019?\n\nMusk\u2019s Tesla purchased Bitcoin, and a new wave of funds and companies followed Saylor\u2019s steps to allocate certain percentages of their treasury into Bitcoin.\n\nAs with the last two halvings, the price of BTC plunged after it reached a new ATH.\n\nThe halving cycle pattern\n\nThroughout these halving cycles, a consistent pattern has emerged. There appear to be five stages to a Bitcoin halving cycle:\n\nSignificant rally before the halving\n\nBrief correction\n\nPeriod of consolidation\n\nMajor bull run\n\nSteep correction.\n\nThe ATH occurred approximately 18 months post-halving. This represents a simplified yet accurate depiction of the previous three cycles.\n\nPlanB, one of the most popular \u2014 yet controversial \u2014 analysts in the cryptocurrency space, summed up a simple strategy for investors, especially those not inclined to engage in active trading, which respected the theory of the halving cycles.\n\n[Buy bitcoin 6 months before a halving and sell 18 months after a halving] has historically beaten [buy&hold]. The next halving is in April 2024 ... will this strategy work again?https://t.co/9kjaCUulwb pic.twitter.com/cbO80Ym7iC \u2014 PlanB (@100trillionUSD) July 3, 2023\n\nThe strategy involves buying BTC six months prior to the halving and taking profits 18 months later from its date.\n\nWhat to expect for the upcoming Bitcoin halving\n\nAs with the last halving, there is a narrative that BTC\u2019s price will rise higher than the previous bull run\u2014and reach a new ATH. In this cycle, the spot Bitcoin ETF approval was the next milestone the market was expecting.\n\nThe upcoming halving is less than 100 days away, and market observers are optimistic about the possibility of a new Bitcoin ATH.\n\nBasel Ismail, CEO of investment analytics company Blockcircle, told Cointelegraph he believes BTC\u2019s price will increase as the halving gets closer but said that the trading activity of the spot Bitcoin ETFs may affect the crypto market.\n\nIsmail compared the gold ETF launch in 2004 and its effects on the price of gold. A pattern emerged where an increase in gold\u2019s price correlated with net gold inflows and decreased with net outflows, suggesting a feedback loop influenced by cash transactions in the physical gold market.\n\nIn his opinion, the spot Bitcoin ETF will mirror the behavior of the gold ETF, potentially acting as an accelerant to Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Substantial inflows should positively affect BTC\u2019s price, but this can be a double-edged sword.\n\nLead-lag analysis indicates that inflows can create price momentum and price changes can influence flows, thereby accentuating both positive and negative market trends. When the gold ETF was launched, the price of gold fluctuated, as marked in the following graph.\n\nThe arrows point to a confluence of variables (price action, volume action, multiple leading technical indicators action and momentum action), which support how gold was in a range-bound sideways accumulation zone.\n\nGold was unable to break out above it for two-thirds of the year. Each time momentum rose, the price pulled back into the same price range. As the market heated up, the selling pressure outweighed the buying pressure.\n\nFor Ismail, this analysis provides insight into how a spot Bitcoin ETF might similarly influence Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nIsmail expects a pullback in the first month after the ETF approvals, stating that the market\u2019s expectations for a rapid BTC price surge after the ETF approval were too high. He claimed that impatience in the market could result in a rapid shift to a pessimistic trend and result in a downward spiral.\n\nDue to this stagnation in market activity, the crypto trader thinks that negative trends could lead to news cycles that will draw down the price of BTC. The market will then frame it as an \u201cunderwhelming response to Bitcoin ETFs being approved.\u201d For Ismail, the horizontal trend could be caused by two factors: a weak and volatile market sentiment and the accelerant effect of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBitcoin post-halving 2024 prediction\n\nIf the reduced supply of new BTC is not accompanied by significant demand, prices will unlikely surge. The spot Bitcoin ETF has eclipsed all the media attention on the possible inflow of money from traditional to crypto markets. But what about the retail investors?\n\nIsmail highlighted several signs indicating that investor sentiment is improving, including an increase in web traffic to Bitcoin\u2019s Wikipedia page, Google search volume for multiple Web3 keywords, a new wave of X (formerly Twitter) followers to prominent layer-1 blockchain and tier-1 centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) and more.\n\nEven if he predicts some months of downside pressure for BTC, he expects Bitcoin to break a new ATH after the halving, reaching as high as $100,000\u2013$150,000 in late 2025.\n\nRecent: Avalanche embraces memecoin culture despite criticism\n\nPrior to the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, several predictions had been made. When 2023 reached its end, artificial intelligence applications suggested $120,000 as the average predicted ATH for BTC. Others predicted higher valuations still.\n\nMultinational bank Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin will reach $200,000 by late 2025, pushed by the ETF approval. Others, such as PlanB, forecast BTC peaking at $532,000 following the halving cycle as indicated in his stock-to-flow model. ARK CEO and founder Cathie Wood predicts Bitcoin will reach $1.5 million by 2030.\n\nWith the arrival of the spot Bitcoin ETF, crypto investors have high morale and trust in BTC\u2019s price for the upcoming months, so patience may be required."

        "content": "You Might Also Like: \u200bCheque fraud victims to get Rs 74 lakh from Axis Bank after 15 years long legal fight\n\nWhat is an exchange-traded fund?\n\n\n\nWhat is a bitcoin ETF?\n\n\n\nDidn\u2019t bitcoin ETFs already exist?\n\n\n\nDo the new products come with any investor protections?\n\n\n\nDoes the SEC\u2019s approval suggest these investment products are safe for ordinary investors?\n\n\n\nThere are 11 new ETFs. How do they differ?\n\n\n\nHow safe is the bitcoin held by these exchange-traded products?\n\n\n\nWhat are the tax implications?\n\n\n\nDo financial planners recommend cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, in this new format?\n\n\n\nWhat do retirement account regulators say about the new products?\n\n\n\nAre bitcoin ETFs available everywhere, given their risks?\n\n\n\nNow that the SEC has approved this, can we expect more crypto-based exchange-traded products?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly a dozen new investments funds that hold bitcoin began trading last week, making it easier for anyone with a basic brokerage account to buy a slice of the digital currency.Several established financial institutions, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have coalesced around bitcoin because it is the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency.But bitcoin remains an enigma to most everyday investors, and it\u2019s hard to separate the buzz from any true potential. It\u2019s also wildly volatile.In other words, it\u2019s a bet. And institutions are wagering that plenty of investors want in.But putting crypto into a traditional investment wrapper does not paper over the underlying risks. Here\u2019s a look at how it works:Exchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds, but they can be traded on an exchange like a stock. ETFs track the performance of the assets they hold, which might include a diversified basket of securities like stock or bonds, or even single commodities, like gold, silver and crypto.They were initially designed to track indexes (like the S&P 500) or spheres of the market and were heralded for their low costs and tax efficiency. But they\u2019ve grown in popularity in recent years. Many ETFs now track narrower and more esoteric slices of the markets, while others use leverage to magnify bets on a specific stock or sector or the market overall.The bitcoin exchange-traded products that recently started trading are designed to track bitcoin\u2019s price, minus the fees and cost of trading. This throws open the gates to any investors with a traditional brokerage account who can now buy the shares as if they were buying stock in Apple or Google.These investments are similar to gold exchange-traded products, which provide an easier way to get exposure to gold without holding the gold bars themselves.There are several other ways to gain direct exposure to bitcoin, including through crypto exchanges as well as specialized digital wallets. But with bitcoin ETFs , you\u2019re delegating the complicated part to large financial institutions, meaning you don\u2019t have to worry about \u201chot wallets,\u201d \u201ccold storage\u201d and lost passwords that can forever lock you out from access to your bitcoin.Yes, but they\u2019re different: ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures contracts \u2014 or agreements to buy or sell an asset at a certain price sometime later \u2014 have been around since 2021. The reason the new products are called \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin ETFs is that they\u2019re holding bitcoin itself, not a derivative that provides secondary exposure. So-called spot markets trade something, often some type of commodity, on the spot, or instantly.The futures-based bitcoin ETFs can end up being more expensive because the contracts expire and must be sold and repurchased, or \u201crolled,\u201d each month. Those costs can be potentially significant, particularly when the new contracts cost more than the previous month\u2019s, causing managers to buy high and sell low.VanEck recently said it would shutter its bitcoin futures ETF now that it offered a spot version.The new bitcoin products are not your standard-issue exchange-traded funds, which, like mutual funds, are typically registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and come with more regulatory protections than these investments.Instead, these \u201cexchange-traded products\u201d are subject to looser controls around their fees and conflicts of interest. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn\u2019t have the same authority to conduct examinations of these products as with typical ETFs.If you\u2019re considering making a small bet, take the time to read the product\u2019s prospectus, which is a typically dense and lengthy document that explains an investment\u2019s objective, high risks, costs and other pertinent information.The prospectus for the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund is 112 pages, but you need to read only six paragraphs before you\u2019re hit over the head with the following, in all caps: THE SHARES ARE SPECULATIVE SECURITIES. THEIR PURCHASE INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK AND YOU COULD LOSE YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT. Disclosures from other providers use the same language.Nope. Just because everyday investors have been granted easy access in a well-known investment wrapper does not change anything about the underlying holdings.Crypto supporters had been pushing for a bitcoin ETF for more than a decade, but the SEC rebuffed them, arguing that the market was awash with fraud and subject to manipulation. (More than 20 related products were denied approval in recent years.) But this time, a federal appeals court decision seemingly forced the SEC\u2019s hand: The court ruled that the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale Investments\u2019 application didn\u2019t adequately explain its denial, since it had already approved similar products using bitcoin futures.The matter was sent back to the SEC, which voted 3-2 to approve the products. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who voted in favor, said the agency\u2019s product approvals were not an endorsement of bitcoin, and he called it \u201cprimarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion and terrorist financing.\u201dCaroline Crenshaw, a Democratic commissioner who voted to deny approval, ran through a list of investor safety concerns in her dissent, from inadequate oversight of the markets to wash trading, where traders artificially increase trading volume by buying and selling products simultaneously, to drum up interest and drive prices higher.They\u2019re pretty similar in both structure and price.But a couple of familiar names \u2014 BlackRock and Fidelity \u2014 set themselves apart from the pack early on with higher trading volumes, which can translate into lower costs for investors. They were followed by Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and Bitwise, a boutique firm that specializes in cryptocurrency. All four products had already amassed roughly $2.5 billion in total assets as of Thursday.But they were eclipsed by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC, which had a head start: It has been around for more than a decade and converted its established bitcoin trust into an ETF, which has about $26 billion in assets.Having nearly a dozen products drop onto the market at once was a huge win for investors: Providers immediately began undercutting one another on price; most fees range from 0.19% of assets annually to 0.39%, according to Morningstar, with many firms waiving fees for an introductory period. Since many online brokerage firms have eliminated most trading commissions, the cost of entry is minimal.There is an outlier: Grayscale has a fee of 1.5%. But more than $1.5 billion had recently flowed out of the fund, probably because some investors are turning to cheaper alternatives.They will be held by a third party. Most of the new ETFs have hired Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, to be their custodian, which means it will be responsible for the security of all the private keys to bitcoin held by these ETFs, explained Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar. It is also likely to be the exchange where much of the trading occurs when the shares of these products are created and cashed out. \u201cMuch relies on Coinbase\u2019s safe passage,\u201d Armour noted.The VanEck Bitcoin Trust hired Gemini, another exchange with an institutional operation. (VanEck\u2019s trading symbol is HODL, an abbreviation for \u201cHold on for dear life,\u201d which refers to holding on to bitcoin despite its stomach-churning volatility.)Fidelity is an exception: Its fund will hold its products\u2019 bitcoin on its own platform, Fidelity Digital Asset Services.For tax purposes, the IRS views bitcoin and other digital currencies as property, not currency, which means it is treated similarly to an investment in stocks.\u201cThe tax treatment of a bitcoin ETF will be similar to holding Bitcoin directly,\u201d said Selva Ozelli, a certified public accountant and the author of \u201cSustainably Investing in Digital Assets Globally.\u201dIf you\u2019ve held the shares for more than a year in a taxable account, any gains would be taxed at the less onerous capital gains rates (generally 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your taxable income and tax bracket that year). Short-term gains, which apply to investments held for a year or less, are taxed as ordinary income.A vast majority do not.\u201cAt best, it\u2019s deemed too volatile,\u201d said Michael Kitces, an influential thinker in the financial advisory industry, who added that advisers were at risk of being sued when markets crashed more than 35%, so there wasn\u2019t much appetite for something that periodically crashed 80% or more. \u201cAt worst, the advisers are skeptics about crypto and its viability altogether.\u201dIn a 2023 survey conducted by the Journal of Financial Planning and the Financial Planning Association, cryptocurrency was dead last on a list of what advisers were using in their clients\u2019 portfolios. The survey found that just 2.3% of advisers allocated crypto, up from 0.3% in 2019, but 3.1% said they planned to recommend it more in the next year. Will that meaningfully change with the availability of user-friendly, low-cost bitcoin ETFs?Kitces said he would expect a segment of advisers to allocate 1% or 2% of a client\u2019s portfolio to bitcoin ETFs, particularly if the individual expressed interest. But others are likely to argue that such a small allocation won\u2019t make a material difference over the long term, so they would rather not introduce the risk. There\u2019s a long list of alternative investments that can help diversify a portfolio \u2014 with less volatility \u2014 before you resort to crypto, he said.They have serious concerns about Americans using their retirement money to invest in crypto, echoing a stance regulators issued a couple of years ago.Few workplace retirement plans offer crypto, but after hearing that more plans were receiving pitches from firms to add digital assets to their investment menus, the Labor Department issued guidance in March 2022, reminding plan administrators of their responsibilities. The department oversees workplace retirement plans, which held $8 trillion on behalf of 96 million 401(k) participants.Retirement plan administrators \u2014 who must act solely in the best interest of the employees participating \u2014 are responsible for choosing prudent investment options. If they include what could be deemed an imprudent option and leave it to the worker to decide its merits, that would amount to a failure of fiduciary duty, the department said in its guidance.\u201cBefore they expose plan participants to the risks associated with cryptocurrency, they should study our guidance carefully and make certain that they can square their actions with their duties of care and loyalty to the plan participants they are charged to protect,\u201d said Lisa Gomez, assistant secretary for employee benefits security at the Labor Department.Not all mainstream institutions are embracing the new crypto ETFs, and firms that make them available will have guardrails.Vanguard has no plans to introduce its own bitcoin ETF, and other firms\u2019 shiny new bitcoin products won\u2019t be available for purchase on its brokerage platform, either.\u201cThese products are not aligned with our long-standing focus on offering core building blocks for long-term investment portfolios to help clients meet goals such as retirement or saving for college,\u201d Vanguard said in a statement. \u201cUnlike equities and bonds, they generally lack intrinsic economic value and do not generate cash flows like dividends and interest payments.\u201dMerrill, part of Bank of America, is making them available only to people with $10 million in investable assets.Others are offering the products, but with some restrictions: Schwab and E-Trade, for example, said the bitcoin ETFs could not be sold short or sold on margin, which involves borrowing money from the brokerage to trade (and can increase gains but amplify losses).Yes. There are already seven applications \u2014 from many of the same players \u2014 to track the spot price of ether, another digital currency, according to Deborah Fuhr, founder and managing partner of ETFGI, a research and consulting firm. And ProShares is seeking approval for a handful of ETFs that make bets on the direction of bitcoin\u2019s price.Industry experts expect these products to be ushered through by regulators, too.\u201cThat\u2019s likely all we get for a while,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, an ETF data and analytics firm. \u201cThe government remains uncertain about cryptocurrency in general.\u201dI\u2019m still thinking about wading in.Before you do, perform a small thought experiment: What would happen if I woke up one morning, and my investment had dropped 40%? How would I react? What would it mean for my finances overall?Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, said his firm\u2019s research had found that once investors allocated more than 5% of their portfolio to cryptocurrency, it became the biggest driver of a portfolio\u2019s steepest losses.\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that gives you a pit in your stomach,\u201d he said."

Overall, 10 of the 11 ETFs have seen inflows totaling almost $3.4 billion so far, with Grayscale notching up $2.2 billion in outflows. The remaining funds have all witnessed less than $100 million worth of total inflows.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs see biggest day of net outflows since launch\n\nOverall, the spot bitcoin ETFs witnessed net outflows of $131.6 million yesterday \u2014 the largest so far \u2014 with GBTC significantly eclipsing inflows from the other funds.\n\nDespite 10 of the 11 ETF products generating a total of $447.9 million worth of inflows, it was not enough to overcome $579.6 million in outflows from Grayscale\u2019s converted fund, according to BitMEX Research.\n\nFidelity (FBTC) and BlackRock (IBIT) spot bitcoin ETFs led yesterday\u2019s inflows, attracting $177.9 million and $145.6 million, respectively. Invesco (BTCO) witnessed the third-largest inflows for the day at $59 million, while Ark Invest/21Shares (ARKB) saw $41.8 million and Bitwise (BITB) $20.1 million.

Tuesday also saw $40.5 million in outflows, compared to $229.4 million worth of inflows on day two and $628.5 million on day one.\n\nGrayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity continue to dominate trading volume and AUM\n\nGrayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s spot bitcoin ETFs continued to dominate trading volume yesterday, with almost $2.1 billion in volume across all the funds adding to a cumulative total approaching $14 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data compiled by The Block.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC contributed nearly $1.1 billion to Thursday\u2019s trading volume, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC generating $416 million and $367 million, respectively.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe big three also dominate in terms of assets under management, according to the latest data compiled by The Block. GBTC currently shows an AUM of $25.6 billion, with IBIT and FBTC at $1.1 billion and $875 million, respectively.\n\nPutting that into perspective, VanEck Digital Asset Strategy Director Gabor Gurbacs said, \u201cThe Bitcoin BTC -7.04% ETFs are a force of nature. They took in 25x El Salvador\u2019s bitcoin holdings, about the size of Tether\u2019s bitcoin assets on reserve, 39% of MicroStrategy\u2019s $8 billion and exceeded silver ETFs\u2026 all in a single week.\u201d\n\nBitcoin price falls and could face more pressure from GBTC profit-taking\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price briefly fell below $41,000 yesterday amid the net outflows from the spot ETFs before recovering slightly. Bitcoin is currently trading at $41,379, according to The Block\u2019s price page \u2014 down 3% over the last 24 hours and around 10% since the ETFs launched on Thursday last week.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face further pressure on its price should GBTC investors continue to take profits, according to analysts at JPMorgan. Last week, JPMorgan estimated up to $3 billion in GBTC outflows as speculative investors were likely to take profits.\n\n\"If the previous $3 billion estimate proves correct and given $1.5 billion has exited already, then there could be an additional $1.5 billion still to exit the bitcoin space via profit-taking on GBTC, thus putting further pressure on bitcoin prices over the coming weeks,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nGBTC investors \u2014 who over the past year had been buying the fund's shares at a significant discount to net asset value to position for a potential ETF conversion \u2014 \"have been taking full profit post-ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs,\" the analysts said."

        "title": "Bitcoin Investment and Mining - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, has gained significant popularity over the years. This digital asset has revolutionized the way people perceive money and investment opportunities. In this article, we will explore the concept of Bitcoin investment and mining and its potential benefits.\n\nBitcoin Investment\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin can be a prudent financial decision for individuals seeking diverse investment portfolios. Bitcoin offers a decentralized and secure method of storing and transferring value. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or financial institution. This decentralization provides several advantages for investors.\n\nPotential for High Returns\n\nOne of the primary reasons why people invest in Bitcoin is its potential for high returns. Bitcoin's price has experienced significant fluctuations over the years, reaching unparalleled highs. For instance, in 2017, the price soared to nearly $20,000 per Bitcoin. Although the price can be volatile, many investors have reaped substantial profits from their initial investment.\n\nDiversification\n\nAnother advantage of investing in Bitcoin is diversification. Traditional investment vehicles, such as stocks and bonds, are subject to market conditions and economic stability. Bitcoin, on the other hand, operates independently from these factors, making it an attractive addition to an investment portfolio. By diversifying their investments, individuals can potentially reduce risk and increase overall returns.\n\nKeep Reading Navigating US Oil Price Trends\n\nHedge against Inflation\n\nInflation can erode the purchasing power of traditional currencies. Bitcoin, with its finite supply capped at 21 million coins, provides an alternative hedge against inflation. This fixed supply ensures that Bitcoin retains its value and cannot be devalued through excessive printing or manipulation. By investing in Bitcoin, individuals can protect their wealth from the effects of inflation.\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining is the process through which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are validated on the blockchain network. It involves solving complex mathematical problems using specialized hardware and software. Miners, in return for their computational efforts, are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins.\n\nSecuring the Network\n\nMining plays a crucial role in securing the Bitcoin network. As miners validate transactions and add them to the blockchain, they ensure the integrity and immutability of the network. Without miners, the Bitcoin network would be vulnerable to attacks and fraud.\n\nEarning Rewards\n\nApart from contributing to network security, mining also allows individuals to earn rewards in the form of Bitcoins. The more computing power a miner contributes, the greater their chances of earning rewards. However, due to the increasing difficulty levels and competition, mining has become more resource-intensive over time. Many miners now join mining pools to combine their computing power and increase their chances of earning rewards.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin investment and mining offer unique opportunities for individuals looking to participate in the digital currency revolution. Investing in Bitcoin can provide high returns, diversification, and protection against inflation. Meanwhile, mining contributes to network security and offers the chance to earn newly minted Bitcoins. As with any investment, it is essential to do thorough research and consider risks before participating in Bitcoin investment and mining."

        "content": "Ark Invest, founded by money manager Cathie Wood, added more units of its own spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded fund on Friday, taking the week\u2019s accumulation to $44 million.\n\nWhat Happened: Ark bought 316,526 units of ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (CBOE: ARKB) on Friday, and the value of the purchase based on the ETF\u2019s closing price of $41.73 was $13.21 million. At the same time, Ark sold 510,337 units of ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE:BITO) valued at $10.25 million.\n\nBITO seeks to generate returns corresponding to the performance of Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin futures contracts. On the other hand, ARKB is among the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs the SEC approved recently. Unlike BITO, ARKB invests directly in Bitcoin.\n\nIn multiple pair trades, the Wood-run firm bought AKRB and sold BITO in three out of the four sessions of the holiday-shortened week.\n\nThe total ARKB units Ark bought this week was 1,047,648, worth $44.09 billion, while it sold 2,026,916 units of BITO valued at $41.06 million.\n\nSee Also: What Is A Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nA pair trade is a market-neutral strategy in which a trader bets two or more securities will diverge or converge in price. Technically, it is shorting one security while going long on another so that the bet is hedged against losses in any of the security.\n\nAs of Friday, ARKB had $309.66 million worth of Bitcoin in its holding, which is comprised 100% of the apex crypto.\n\nWood is a Bitcoin bull and expects the crypto to hit $1.5 million by 2030.\n\nProfiting From AMD Strength? Ark, through its Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) on Friday sold 45,052 shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), with the sale likely fetching the firm $7.85 million.\n\nAMD closed Friday\u2019s session at $174.23, up 7.11%, according to Benzinga Pro data. The stock added nearly 19% for the week after sell-side analysts placed confidence in the company as one that is best positioned to profit out of the second wave of AI.\n\nThree analysts raised their price targets for AMD this week while maintaining their bullish recommendations.\n\nRead Next: Elon Musk Goes \u2018Wow\u2019 After Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood Points Out Bitcoin Is \u2018Backed By The Largest Computer Network\u2019\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Bitcoin [BTC) has dropped over 15% since the inaugural launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last week with several billion in assets flowing out of Grayscale's GBTC. While a chunk of those billions has been from investors moving to lower fee ETFs and another chunk from investors taking profits on GBTC's (and bitcoin's) absolute price rise, at least some of that money is due to traders exiting what's likely been a very profitable bet that GBTC's discount to net asset value (NAV) would narrow.\n\n\u201cIt looks like GBTC investors who over the past year had been buying the GBTC fund at a significant discount to NAV to position for its eventual ETF conversion, have been taking full profit post-ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs,\u201d analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.\n\nBefore being uplisted to an ETF from a trust, GBTC was one of one of the only ways for stock traders in the U.S. to gain exposure to the price movements of bitcoin without the need to purchase the actual cryptocurrency. That made it the largest regulated bitcoin fund in the world by AUM. The bank had previously estimated that up to $3 billion had been invested in GBTC in the secondary market during 2023 to exploit the trust\u2019s discount to NAV. If this estimate is correct, and given that $1.5 billion has already exited, there could be an additional $1.5 billion to exit the space via profit-taking on GBTC, which will put further pressure on bitcoin prices in the coming weeks. These outflows are also putting pressure on GBTC to lower its fees, the report said, adding that the \u201cGBTC fee at 1.5% still looks too high compared to other spot bitcoin ETFs risking further outflows.\u201d \u201cA lot more capital, perhaps an additional $5 billion-$10 billion, could exit GBTC if it loses its liquidity advantage,\u201d the bank cautioned. As of Friday, GBTC is the most expensive ETF among counterparts, with some charging zero fees for the first six months or until a certain assets under management (AUM) target is reached.\n\nJPMorgan says other spot bitcoin ETFs, minus GBTC, attracted $3 billion of inflows in only four days, and this is comparable to the inflows seen during previous bitcoin product launches. Most of this $3 billion of inflows reflects a rotation from existing bitcoin vehicles such as futures-based ETFs, the report added."

        "content": "Most of the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF) approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) won\u2019t survive, Grayscale Investment CEO Michael Sonnenshein says.\n\nIn a Jan. 18 interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Sonnenshein predicted that the majority of the 11 approved spot Bitcoin ETFs will likely fail.\n\nThe U.S. SEC officially approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, with 10 beginning trading the next day. Many ETF issuers were actively lowering their trading fees to raise competitiveness with other ETF sponsors, with most of the approved ETFs setting fees between 0.2% and 0.4%. Multiple spot Bitcoin ETF providers also offered temporary fee waivers.\n\nOn the other hand, Grayscale \u2014 the largest Bitcoin holder among spot Bitcoin ETF issuers \u2014 charges as much as 1.5% without any waivers.\n\nSonnenshein defended Grayscale\u2019s fees for its spot Bitcoin ETF product, which are the highest in the market, stating that only two or three spot Bitcoin ETFs are here to stay, and the rest will be pulled from the market:\n\n\u201cI think from our standpoint, it may at times call into question their long-term commitment to the asset class [...] I don\u2019t ultimately think that the marketplace will have ultimately these 11 spot products we find ourselves having.\u201d\n\nSonnenshein\u2019s remarks came on the fifth day of spot Bitcoin ETF trading in the United States. Since the trading launch, Grayscale has become the only issuer aggressively dumping Bitcoin, offloading as much as 37,947 BTC by Jan. 18. In contrast, the other nine issuers have added at least 40,000 BTC to their products since the start of trading.\n\nQuantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that most ETF issuers will likely fail in the long term because most investors will prefer to hold their assets or opt for self-custody.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETFs scoop up another 10,600 BTC on day 5\n\n\u201cFor now, having spot ETFs is a good way for some portfolio managers to gain exposure who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to,\u201d Greenspan told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\n\u201cBut having 11 of them is pretty ridiculous. There will have to be a consolidation, and they all know it, which is why fees are on the floor.\u201d\n\nSome executives at spot Bitcoin ETF issuers believe there\u2019s no conflict between self-custody and spot Bitcoin ETFs. \u201cSelf-custody and an ETF are not mutually exclusive,\u201d ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said during a space on X (formerly Twitter) on Jan. 10. She also noted that ARK\u2019s Bitcoin ETF \u2014 which charges a fee of 0.21% \u2014 doesn\u2019t aim to maximize profits.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at Bitcoin as a public good. And one of the ways to do that is this low-fee product. We have other actively managed strategies where we can do more on the profitability side. That is not our objective here,\u201d Wood stated.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin ETF guru Eric Balchunas has the last laugh at doubters: X Hall of Flame"

        "title": "Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Despite ETF Approval? - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nAfter introducing Bitcoin ETFs, the crypto market fell from $1.82 trillion to $1.66 trillion. Ethereum and other coins rose as Bitcoin\u2019s dominance fell below 50%. Bitcoin hovered around $42,500, with traders eyeing purchases below $40,000.\n\nExperts believe the immediate impact of the Bitcoin ETF approval is mostly over, expecting a more stable market. Despite the approval, Bitcoin\u2019s value unexpectedly dropped by 17.7% in the past week, reaching $40,500 from nearly $49k on January 11, despite the entry of major players like BlackRock.\n\nFactors Leading to Bitcoin Downtrend\n\nTo understand this sudden downturn, market intelligence firm IntoTheBlock analyzed on-chain data. They observed continuous inflows of Bitcoin into centralized exchanges (CEXs) for six weeks, totaling almost $2 billion in net deposits. Typically, sustained deposits into exchanges signal sell-offs, raising questions about the entities behind the selling pressure.\n\nAn important insight was the record-high average holding time for transacted Bitcoin, indicating that long-held BTC tokens were circulating. As per the research, it is linked to the outflow of individuals leaving the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nHowever, the analysis also highlighted trends in Bitcoin addresses. Those holding over 1,000 BTC increased their wallets, while those with fewer than 1,000 BTC reduced their holdings in January. Addresses holding Bitcoin for 1-12 months decreased their balances. Long-term holders slightly decreased overall Bitcoin holdings, while short-term holders increased their positions since October 2023.\n\nDespite concerns about the shift from long-term to short-term holders, IntoTheBlock argued that this scenario differs from previous market tops. Factors such as lower volume compared to previous bull markets and a limited decrease in long-term holders\u2019 balances led the platform to suggest that Bitcoin might be facing a temporary setback rather than entering a bearish trend. They anticipate the asset returning to bullish territory.\n\nAfter Short-Term Profit Taking, The Real Challenge\n\nThe other factor adding to the Bitcoin woes is the short-term impact of the spot Bitcoin ETF, which seems to be fading, as indicated by futures and options data. Since traders find the funding rate appealing, suggesting an imminent start of buying activities. Over the last 4 hours, both BTC futures and options open interests (OI) have been on the rise.\n\nThe total BTC futures open interest, covering various exchanges like CME, Binance, and Coinbase, is bouncing back with a 0.35% increase, reaching $18.31 billion. This signals a potential recovery in market interest and activity.\n\nThe ETFs on #Bitcoin have a net inflow of $782 million over the first three days.\n\n\n\nThat's more than 50% higher than ALL ETFs combined have done in 2023 in terms of volume.\n\n\n\nPeople are bearish on #Bitcoin and have a negative outlook.\n\n\n\nDon't be like that. Buy the dip and hold. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 17, 2024\n\nMichael van de Poppe, a top analyst, says don\u2019t be negative about Bitcoin\u2019s falling price. Instead, he suggests buying when prices drop and holding onto it long-term.\n\n"

        "content": "Agencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approval of 11 Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) marks a significant milestone in the history of crypto . This event signifies a new era of legitimacy and potential growth for Bitcoin, prompting widespread interest from both retail and institutional investors . Let's take a quick look at the top takeaways from this landmark development and explore its implications for the future of Bitcoin.The SEC's decision to approve 11 Bitcoin ETFs is a historic moment, introducing a new asset class to the global financial markets . This move is expected to lower barriers to entry for investors, simplifying access to Bitcoin investments through traditional investment channels.The ETF approval is poised to significantly impact Bitcoin's market value. Analysts like Tom Lee of Fundstrat and Metlem Demirors of Coinshares predict a significant increase in demand, with price targets ranging from a short-term $100,000 to $150,000 and a long-term potential of $500,000 within the next 3 to 5 years.Currently, Bitcoin stands at the 10th position among the world's largest assets. However, this ranking is expected to rise rapidly. Bitcoin is anticipated to soon surpass major assets such as Meta, Silver, and even tech giant Nvidia, reflecting its growing significance in the global asset hierarchy.There's a notable surge in institutional interest and investment in Bitcoin, particularly in derivative markets. The open interest in Bitcoin Futures on the CME Exchange has achieved a new record, reaching an unprecedented high of 36% in relative dominance. This indicates the substantial involvement of institutional investors in the derivatives market, particularly in purchasing Bitcoin Futures. Additionally, there is a notable surge in Bitcoin short positions, reflecting heightened market activity.Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event in April, where the reward for mining new blocks is halved, is anticipated to further enhance its scarcity, thus potentially driving up its value. This supply shock, combined with a wall of institutional money that is going to come, contributes significantly to Bitcoin's appeal as a long-term investment.Another unique factor is that the percentage of Bitcoin's (BTC) circulating supply that was last active on-chain is about 70% which means that they are HODLing (a term in the crypto community meaning to hold onto the currency long-term). Now, the trend of short-term Bitcoin holders converting to long-term HODLers highlights growing confidence in Bitcoin's future. This shift indicates a belief in the enduring value of Bitcoin, despite its known volatility.Blackrock\u2019s move to cut the fee on its spot ETF to 0.25% makes Bitcoin investments more accessible and cost-effective. This strategic decision is likely to attract a larger group of investors, further embedding Bitcoin in mainstream investment portfolios. Moreover, for the first time, Bitcoin gets serious marketing budgets from these 11 ETFs.The ETF approval has triggered a global ripple effect, with other financial hubs like Hong Kong gearing up to launch additional Bitcoin ETFs. This global adoption speaks volumes about Bitcoin's increasing acceptance and potential for becoming a standard component in investment portfolios worldwide.Financial advisors the world over are beginning to recognise Bitcoin as a viable asset class and will now recommend varying allocations in investment portfolios. This change reflects a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a speculative instrument to a legitimate investment option.Despite facing volatility and regulatory challenges, Bitcoin continues to show robust growth potential. The mainstream acceptance and institutionalisation of Bitcoin ETFs underscore a bullish outlook for the future of this digital asset.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a regulatory development; it\u2019s a paradigm shift in the world of finance. It signifies the merging of traditional investment methods with the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin continues to make strides into mainstream finance, it\u2019s not only reshaping the investment landscape but also challenging the traditional notions of finance and asset management. With institutional backing, reduced barriers to entry, and a growing acceptance among the general public, Bitcoin is poised to play a pivotal role in the future of global finance. This development marks the beginning of a new chapter, not just for Bitcoin but for the entire crypto ecosystem. As we witness this historic moment, one thing is clear: the world of finance is evolving, and Bitcoin is at the forefront of this revolution.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

And this is a good sign because Bitcoin is still 40% below its all-time high and the S&P is right near its all-time high.\n\nSo if you look back in time, the second halving [2016], the S&P 500 broke its all-time high during the second halving and about seven months later, Bitcoin broke its all-time high. That was about a seven-month difference.\n\nAnd the third halving [2020], the most recent halving, the S&P broke its all-time high and about four months later, Bitcoin broke its all-time high.\u201d\n\nOn what Bitcoin is likely to do as the S&P 500 index hovers just below its all-time high of 4,796 points reached on January 3rd of 2022, Svenson says,\n\n\u201cBitcoin is likely, I would say, less than half a year away, probably about four months away from its all-time high.\n\nSo if the S&P breaks its all-time high, well, we can be pretty sure that Bitcoin is just months away from doing the same thing and then we would be off into this bull market.

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nCoinbase argues stocks, Terraform Labs and Howey in 5-hour SEC face-off\n\nUnited States District Judge Katherine Polk Failla has heard arguments from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Coinbase on the crypto exchange\u2019s motion for dismissal of a lawsuit filed by the regulator in June 2022. The hearing was held for nearly five hours and provided an extensive overview of the key arguments in courts regarding the crypto space, assets and the SEC\u2019s role in regulating the industry. During the hearing, the SEC argued that buyers of tokens are also investing in the network or ecosystem behind it, indicating there is a value proposition behind a token purchase. Coinbase\u2019s attorneys, however, challenged the argument, claiming that Bitcoin \u2014 described as a commodity by an SEC attorney during the hearing \u2014 is also backed by a community and has a network.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents seek dismissal of FTX clawback lawsuit\n\nThe parents of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried are seeking to have FTX\u2019s lawsuit against them dismissed, rejecting claims that they knew about the problems at the crypto exchange and knowingly benefitted from misconduct at the firm. According to a court filing, lawyers representing Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried argued that FTX\u2019s lawsuit sought to \u201ccapitalize on the sheer fact\u201d that they were the parents of the former FTX CEO.

The decision follows a revision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS. The law came into effect on Jan. 1 and required all U.S. businesses to report crypto transactions over $10,000. However, the tax regulator has stepped back from enforcing the rule for now. The IRS said it and the Treasury intend to issue proposed regulations concerning digital asset reporting but didn\u2019t specify when they would be introduced.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs scoop up another 10,600 BTC on day 5\n\nIssuers of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added another net 10,667 Bitcoin to their spot products on the fifth trading day amid increasing volume.

        "title": "Bitcoin Dips Below $41000 -- More Price Drop to Come, or Rebound Expected? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin slides below $41,000, making a lower low, according to chart data.\n\nPrice action structure turning bearish.\n\nTwo scenarios ahead, but both point to more downside.\n\nAfter reaching $49,000 at its peak on January 11, the price of Bitcoin slid to $41,720, where it attempted to stabilize. Today, January 19, it fell lower, reaching $40,630 at its lowest. This price difference of only 2.3% isn\u2019t significant by its amount but rather by its price structure.\n\nThis lower low could indicate a much larger downfall yet to come. Our previous analysis examined the possibility of Bitcoin going to $36,000 and even lower. With today\u2019s price action development, this outcome looks highly likely.\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Bitcoin made an upward spike, attempting to break above the $47,000 resistance, and at first, it appeared that it had the strength to do so. However, the rise to $49,000 was only temporary, leaving a wick on the daily chart.\n\nThis quick downturn indicated that sellers were present at those levels, and with the consequent downfall to the $41,000 area on a strong move, it was shown that the upside wasn\u2019t sustainable.\n\nAs the price started to move sideways, around $41,000, there was a strong chance it could find support and continue its upward journey, breaking the resistance on the next move. But with today\u2019s lower low, this possibility was invalidated.\n\nFrom its January 11 peak, we saw a five-wave move to the downside, indicating impulsiveness and a likely downtrend continuation.\n\nBTC Price Prediction\n\nExamining the Bitcoin wave structure further, we can expect another lower low, potentially at the $39,200 area, which would mark the completion of the first descending move in a larger downtrend.\n\nWe can see a recovery to $43,100, which would be an upward correction in the larger downtrend and serve to make the first lower high. If this plays out, then another even stronger downtrend would start and lead the price of Bitcoin to its next significant horizontal zone of around $36,000.\n\nThe corrective stage of BTC could end on this low, making a solid bounce and heading to another uptrend. But there would also be a chance that we might see an even lasting correction with Bitcoin\u2019s price falling to $26,800.\n\nWhat happens at the $36,000 will be paramount for these future expectations. A new starting uptrend will likely be higher if it bounces strongly. But if it breaks the level and continues further below it, it would signal a much larger correction is in play.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF approvals come with stark warning from SEC Chair - JD Supra",
        "content": "\u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin\u2026. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d\u2014SEC Chair Gary Gensler\n\nNotwithstanding Mr. Gensler\u2019s warning, he, along with two other Commissioners, voted last week to approve 11 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding Bitcoin for the first time since the inception of cryptocurrency. As of January 10, 2024, US securities exchanges may list Bitcoin ETFs for trading. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts hope this decision signals a broader adoption of cryptocurrency in the United States. Perhaps it does, but celebration may be premature\u2014the decision almost certainly means enhanced regulatory scrutiny in this space.\n\nAn ETF is a type of investment fund holding assets\u2014like stocks, bonds or commodities\u2014traded on stock exchanges. Previously, for large swaths of American investors, investing in cryptocurrency was not so straightforward. Today, these investments are available on Nasdaq, CboeBZX Exchange and NYSE Arca. This offers the introduction of shares of Bitcoin into mainstream investment plans and creates a new bridge between Bitcoin and centralized finance (CeFi).\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to approve these ETFs was tepid and followed a losing court battle, which largely forced the SEC\u2019s hand. In August 2023, the SEC lost a DC Circuit appeal with Grayscale Investments over whether the SEC needed to reevaluate its decision to decline Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s (GBTC) latest application to convert to an ETF. In the announcement, Chair Gensler made it clear that the SEC \u201cdid not approve or endorse Bitcoin\u201d but that the ETF approvals were \u201cthe most sustainable path forward\u201d after its court defeat.\n\nGBTC\u2019s path to ETF conversion has been a rocky one. Founded in 2013, GBTC operated as a trust, offering its investors shares of Bitcoin exclusively. GBTC is currently valued at nearly $29 billion. Shareholders of GBTC do not actually own Bitcoin\u2014they own shares of a trust that has access to Bitcoin. While GBTC slowly obtained regulatory approval over the past decade, the lack of classification as an ETF came with significant drawbacks for stabilizing the price of GBTC. New GBTC shares were restricted for between six and 12 months from the date of purchase, meaning they could not be sold regardless of the value\u2014whether the shares were trading at a premium or a discount. After the hold period, the shares became unrestricted and holders could resell those shares in the public over-the-counter (OTC) market. Further, the SEC did not allow investors to redeem GBTC shares directly from Grayscale Investments, forcing investors wishing to offload their GBTC shares to sell to another investor. This greatly hampered GBTC\u2019s ability to track the price of Bitcoin since investors would often be forced to sell their shares at discounts to other investors. Now that GBTC is an ETF, the redemption prohibition and hold periods are gone. The day after GBTC\u2019s ETF conversion, it was listed on NYSE Arca.\n\n***\n\nThe SEC\u2019s reluctance to approve GBTC and the other ETFs should alert the market to likely enhanced regulatory scrutiny in the future. The SEC narrowly granted these approvals following a 3-2 vote by the Commissioners. While Mr. Gensler supported approval, he warned that \u201cinvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d He further caveated that these approvals were limited to ETPs holding Bitcoin and \u201cin no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities\u201d or \u201canything about the Commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws\u2026.\u201d Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw had even sharper words about the decision: \u201cfraud and manipulation that impacts the price of spot Bitcoin surely impacts the price of the spot Bitcoin held in the ETPs.\u201d She went on to say that \u201cour investor protection inquiry necessarily begins with the spot Bitcoin markets. Are those markets safe? Substantial evidence indicates that the answer is no.\u201d\n\nThe SEC Commissioners\u2019 reluctance forewarns of the SEC\u2019s continued effort to control, through regulation, the cryptocurrency enterprise writ large, and this change most certainly will be followed by an uptick in regulatory actions involving cryptocurrency-related fraud, market manipulation and failure to adhere to existing requirements\u2014particularly now that ETFs offer a larger group of American investors an additional option for their 401(k)s and investment accounts.\n\nGrayscale may have written the playbook for crypto ETFs, but now they, along with others, will have more rules to follow. While a new pool of investors gained access to GBTC, GBTC now must comply with a host of new regulations and requirements, including stringent listing criteria, continuous monitoring of trading activity and periodic financial reporting.\n\nIf cryptocurrency-investment firms and exchanges have any chance of surviving the regulatory onslaught to come, they must heed the lessons of the past in their preparation for the future. Compliance should be atop that list of preparation. Building, implementing, and documenting robust compliance programs today is paramount to their survival tomorrow.\n\n[View source.]"

You can use it to buy and sell real estate and move data, tokenising things that you do something with.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF is first to $1bn AUM\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, called iShares Bitcoin Trust or IBIT, reached $1 billion in assets under management in about a week of trading, the first among 11 newly launched ETFs to do so, Reuters reported, citing JPMorgan data.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the ETFs tracking the biggest cryptocurrency last week, and BlackRock\u2019s IBIT had accumulated $1.07 billion in assets under management by January 17.\n\nRobert Mitchnick, BlackRock\u2019s head of digital assets, told Fortune that the considerable inflows to IBIT demonstrated strong investor demand.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a long-term commitment focused on providing investors access to an iShares quality ETF.\u201d\n\nHong Kong planning spot crypto EFTs\n\nHong Kong is planning a more flexible approach than the US towards spot crypto ETFs, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s proposed regulations for spot crypto ETFs would allow both cash and in-kind subscriptions. In Hong Kong, dealers will be allowed to use Bitcoin to subscribe to or redeem the ETF\u2019s shares, while in the US, cash must be used, the report said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.23% today at $41,530.80.\n\nEthereum is down 0.82% today at $2,469.63.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading"

        "content": "Bitcoin mining has achieved a new sustainability milestone, with 54.5% of its energy consumption now powered by renewable sources, according to the Bitcoin ESG Forecast, a research series by Daniel Batten, a co-founder of methane mitigation fund CH4 Capital.\n\nThe industry has been reducing its carbon footprint and addressing one of the most critical concerns. Public scrutiny of the environmental impact of digital currencies has intensified with its rising popularity.\n\nBitcoin mining, the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation, is known for its high energy consumption. The industry\u2019s pivot to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power aligns with global efforts to combat climate change and promotes the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\nThe push for sustainable mining practices is not just about environmentalism; it\u2019s also a strategic move for the industry. As the world increasingly values sustainability, the cryptocurrency sector is positioning itself to be more attractive to environmentally conscious investors and users.\n\nThe use of renewable energy can lead to cost savings over time for Bitcoin producers, or miners, as these sources become more efficient and less expensive than traditional fossil fuels.\n\nRecent reports citing on-chain data suggest that miners have been offloading Bitcoin en masse.\n\nBitcoin is also one of the most popular blockchains for non-fungible tokens. The network became the fourth blockchain to surpass US$2 billion in historic NFT sales, according to CryptoSlam."

        "content": "Investors have poured $1.9 billion into nine new exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of bitcoin in their first three days of trading, data from issuers and analysts showed, with fund giants BlackRock and Fidelity pulling in the lion\u2019s share of the flows.\n\n(Reuters) \u2014 A new batch of U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has attracted strong investor interest, though it is unclear if they will be able to maintain the pace of inflows in coming weeks.\n\nCollective flows to the nine funds outpaced postlaunch flows into the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which drew a record $1.2 billion in the first three days of trading after its 2021 launch.

Some bullish analysts have said flows could reach between $50 billion and $100 billion by the end of the year.\n\nBitcoin is down more than 8% since Jan. 11, after rallying in recent months on anticipation that the ETFs would finally get the nod from the SEC.\n\n\u201cSo far, the launches have almost measured up to the hype,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF analyst at Strategas. \u201cThe next question is, What is their staying power?

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF from asset management giant BlackRock has attracted more than $700 million, while Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund has topped $500 million, according to BitMEX Research, a cryptocurrency research and analysis firm.\n\nFees among the nine issuers\u2014before waivers\u2014range from a low of 0.19% to a high of 0.39%.\n\nBlackRock is charging a fee of 0.12% for the first $5 billion in assets and the first 12 months of trading. After that, the fee will rise to 0.25%. Fidelity is initially charging zero, rising to 0.25% after July 31. Those fees will still be less than half the average ETF fee of 0.54%, as calculated by Morningstar Inc.\n\n\u201cFees are clearly a key determinant for success,\u201d said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, which is providing the index against which six of the new ETFs will be measured.\n\n\u201cThose that charge the lower management fees will unsurprisingly make themselves more appealing compared to their peers. Brand recognition is another core aspect.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Brands\n\nWhile BlackRock and Fidelity have dominated inflows, other issuers with a strong brand among cryptocurrency aficionados aren\u2019t that far behind.\n\nBoth Bitwise and a joint venture of Ark Investments and 21Shares are initially waiving fees. Bitwise said its inflows in the first three days totaled $305.5 million, while the Ark/21Shares ETF has had inflows of nearly $230 million, according to BitMEX.\n\nBy contrast, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, with a fee of 1.5%, has seen outflows this month. The trust was converted into an ETF at the same time the other ETFs were launched, and has seen $1.16 billion in outflows in its first three trading days, data from BitMEX showed.\n\nPaul Karger, founder of Twin Focus, a boutique wealth management advisory firm, says some of his clients are selling their GBTC holdings and moving into the cheaper new ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a shift from GBTC to the new, lower-cost ETFs, as well as some clients putting more money to work in the cheaper options\u201d from brand-name issuers, he said.\n\nRepresentatives for Grayscale did not immediately provide comment. Speaking to Bloomberg at Davos on Wednesday, CEO Michael Sonnenshein said that while fees are a consideration, investors should also look at a product\u2019s size, liquidity, and track record.\n\nThe next hurdle for the funds will likely be demonstrating their ability to win acceptance by institutional investors, such as pension funds, and investment advisers.\n\n\u201cThe question of what to do with these in a portfolio has been drowned out by a lot of the noise\u201d surrounding the new products\u2019 debut, Steve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, said ahead of that launch. Galaxy has partnered with Invesco to launch the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, one of the nine new spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe process of talking about what kind of allocation is appropriate and how spot bitcoin ETFs will \u201cwork their way into model portfolios will come into focus in the next six months,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 By Suzanne McGee, Reuters, with additional reporting by Hannah Lang\n\n______\n\nFast Company \u00a9 2024 Mansueto Ventures LLC.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDespite calling Bitcoin the greatest distraction from blockchain\u2014which she described as one of the greatest disruptions in financial services\u2014Franklin Templeton President and CEO Jenny Johnson said she's still on board.\n\n\u201cA lot of people took that as I'm not a believer in Bitcoin,\u201d Johnson told CNBC. \u201cAnd yet, launching this ETF, you can see, obviously, the demand that's out there for Bitcoin, and I think there's a lot of reasons why that is.\u201d\n\nAs an example, she pointed to the increasingly prevalent capability to pay for things with Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201c[Blockchain] technology is going to open up a lot of really interesting types of investment opportunities,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nCalling Bitcoin just one of a suite of investment possibilities, Johnson noted Franklin Templeton created a tokenized fund on the stellar blockchain, which the investment firm launched in 2021. That same year, Franklin Templeton said in a filing with the SEC plans to raise $20 million for a blockchain venture fund.\n\nLaunched in 1947, Franklin Templeton is a global investment firm offering asset management and fund services to individuals and institutions; the firm currently has over $1.4 trillion under management.\n\nEarlier this year, Franklin Templeton said its Nasdaq-listed OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) would use the Ethereum scaling network Polygon to be \u201cfurther compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Franklin Templeton\u2019s involvement in blockchain goes back to 2019, when the global asset manager partnered with institutional wallet provider Curv to manage digital shares on the stellar blockchain.\n\nEchoing recent comments by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Johnson said a factor in the continued interest in Bitcoin is its hedge against oppressive governments, saying that as she traveled the world, she would hear stories of people keeping 50% of their savings in Bitcoin because of fear of their fiat money being confiscated because of saying the wrong things.\n\n\u201cThere's a fear component to it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c[Bitcoin] is considered almost an insurance or safety component. But I also think it's really important to be fueling what is the next real opportunity in the blockchain world.\u201d\n\nJohnson said Bitcoin ETFs are attractive to investors because they do not have to deal with managing private keys, which are technically complext to manage and give direct access to the investor's Bitcoin holdings.\n\n\u201cIt's really complicated. I did it at one point, and then I was trying to actually figure out how to get back in, and it's hard,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo being able to open it up and have access to that through an ETF, and just simply through your brokerage account, is a much better way to access it.\u201d\n\nJohnson emphasized the firm\u2019s expertise in active investment strategies, which are available in various forms, including mutual funds and ETFs.\n\n\u201cYou're seeing a lot more actively managed ETFs, and that's a space that we're very focused on,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs, including applications by Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, GrayScale, and VanEck.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, the Franklin Templeton Twitter account hinted at the firm\u2019s future plans involving Ethereum and Solana.\n\n\u201cOn Solana, we see Anatoly\u2019s vision of a single atomic state machine as a powerful use case of decentralized blockchains, lowering information asymmetry,\u201d they said. \u201cDespite the midlife crisis it's recently experienced, we see a bright future with many strong tailwinds to push the Ethereum ecosystem forward,\u201d the account said.\n\nWhile a Franklin Templeton spokesperson declined to comment on the firm\u2019s future offerings, they told Decrypt that the company continuously monitors developments in digital assets.\n\n\u201cWe cannot comment on any potential future fund offerings, but we can say that we are continuously monitoring developments in the digital assets and ETF ecosystems for opportunities to diversify our off,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "title": "Bitcoin price recovery at risk due to DXY strength, GBTC selling - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) traders are reeling from the current sell-off, with the recently launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failing to produce the desired price upside. In addition to steady Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) outflows impacting BTC price, market participants are now facing yet another problem: a strong U.S. dollar.\n\nThe U.S. dollar\u2019s sharp recovery\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback\u2019s performance against an array of top foreign currencies, has risen 2.71% from its Dec. 27 low of 100.617 amid encouraging United States economic data.\n\nRetail sales, the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index and weekly initial jobless claims all provided tailwinds to the DXY, lifting it to new 2024 highs in the 103.65\u2013103.70 range.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that December 2023 retail sales registered 0.6% growth against the expected 0.4% and 0.3% from the previous period.\n\nThe dollar\u2019s recovery has also been attributed to a rebound in U.S. yields across the curve, all in response to declining bets on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve might start cutting interest rates as soon as March.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the U.S. Dollar Index looks poised to rise by more than 1.12% due to the formation of a classic V-shaped recovery pattern.\n\nDXY 1-day chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the DXY successfully breaks above its neckline of 104.56, the likelihood of an extended recovery toward 107 over the next few months is higher.\n\nMassive GBTC outflows impact BTC price\n\nSince the spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched on Jan. 11, massive outflows have been witnessed from GBTC. As a result, Grayscale has liquidated a large number of Bitcoin as part of its GBTC holdings. Nearly 38,000 BTC has left GBTC since it was converted to a spot ETF on Jan. 11.\n\n30,496 #Bitcoin was bought since ETF Launch.\n\n\n\nExcluding $GBTC (selling driven by high fees vs others), the 9 ETFs bought 68,442 $BTC - a staggeringly large number.\n\n\n\nOnly 900 #Bitcoin is mined daily (dropping to 450/day in April) \u2014 CC15Capital (@Capital15C) January 18, 2024\n\nThere were $484 million in outflows from Grayscale on Jan. 12 alone as GBTC holders capitalized on open redemption options.\n\nIn a recent statement, popular economist and gold bug Peter Schiff suggested that despite the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, the price of BTC is not increasing due to outflows from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC product. He mentioned that even though the total inflows were larger, it seemed to have a limited impact on the overall BTC market.\n\nThe reason that investor buying of the new #BitcoinETFs isn't pushing up the price of #Bitcoin is that the outflows from $GBTC plus selling of #BTC exceed the combined inflows into all of the other ten Bitcoin ETFs. Once the initial ETF demand wanes, I expect a bigger price drop. \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) January 17, 2024\n\nRelated: Bitcoin trader who called $48K BTC price top flags new bearish signal\n\nBitcoin price could retrace to $34,000\n\nIndependent market analyst Ali has pointed out the movement of the BTC price in an ascending parallel channel since late 2022. According to Ali, Bitcoin\u2019s current correction is due to rejection from the channel\u2019s upper boundary at $48,000.\n\nIt appears this parallel channel is holding true! This suggests that #Bitcoin faced rejection from the channel's upper boundary at $48,000, and now $BTC will retrace to the lower boundary at $34,000, and then rebound back to the upper boundary at $57,000. https://t.co/2vDqYpwmpi pic.twitter.com/fBiNsmJ10C \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) January 13, 2024\n\nThe analyst anticipates a retracement for Bitcoin, projecting a decline to the lower boundary at $34,000.\n\nHowever, market intelligence firm Santimet said the market was still optimistic about the long-term impact of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe firm posted the following chart on X, adding:\n\n\u201cHowever, the #FOMO surrounding the approvals arguably helped mark a local #crypto top, as many experts believed that the foregone conclusion of these approvals was already \u2018baked in\u2019 to the market\u2019s prices at the time the announcements were made.\u201d\n\nBTC price performance. Source: Santiment\n\nAfter Bitcoin experienced a 16.9% drop from $49,000 last week to $40,600, Santiment said that the narrative surrounding these ETFs might shift to \u201cassociating them with words like #scam or #ripoff or #disaster.\u201d\n\nIf a bearish sentiment emerges around the subject that initially drove prices higher from October through December, Santiment anticipates FUD \u2014 fear, uncertainty and doubt \u2014 could trigger a series of selloffs from novice traders.\n\nthrough December, this #FUD and the inevitable selloffs from novice traders will likely allow for a market rebound from patient opportunists that continue to accumulate during these lower price levels. https://t.co/82igfnpKHS \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 19, 2024\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission finally gave the green light for spot bitcoin exchange traded funds to list in the U.S. The Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) is one of the 10 ETFs providing exposure to spot prices of the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBTCO joins the equity-based Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) and the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC) as members of the Invesco crypto ETF suite while extending the issuer\u2019s partnership with Galaxy Digital.\n\n\u201cGalaxy is a digital asset and blockchain leader, providing access to the growing digital economy by applying traditional finance expertise and deep crypto know-how, as well as advanced research engine capabilities,\u201d according to Invesco.\n\nBottom line: The Invesco/Galaxy pairing signals confidence and trust \u2014 two issues that are paramount to advisors and investors wading into the cryptocurrency universe.\n\nBitcoin ETF BTCO Has Advantages\n\nAs noted above, the field of fresh spot bitcoin ETFs is expansive, and these products have the same investment objective. That means competitors need avenues for standing out from the pack in an effort to capture attention from advisors and investors.\n\nBTCO accomplishes that objective. The fund\u2019s annual fee is 0.39%, or $39 on a $10,000 investment. That\u2019s decent among the spot bitcoin ETF field, but Invesco enhances that proposition by waiving that fee for the first six months up until BTCO\u2019s assets under management reach $5 billion. Plus, BTCO, like its peers, could prove to be a well-timed addition to the ETF space.\n\nAlex Pickard, vice president, research at Research Affiliates and a former bitcoin miner, said he expects bitcoin to deliver returns in excess of those posted by gold following the launch of the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) nearly two decades ago. Today, GLD is home to more than $56 billion in assets under management, easily making it the largest commodities exchange traded product. It\u2019s possible BTCO and/or its peers could follow a similar long-term trajectory.\n\nThe debuts of spot bitcoin ETFs, such as BTCO, \u201clegitimize bitcoin, and digital currencies in general, in the minds of investors,\u201d wrote Pickard. \u201cPublic policy will become more accommodative to cryptocurrencies, recognizing that government agencies have signed off on the public owning this asset class in their brokerage and retirement accounts.\u201d\n\nAdding to the allure of BTCO and friends is the potential for increased access to advisory realm, which could stoke inflows of $50 billion to $100 billion this year, according to Standard Chartered.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Asian regulators usually wave through SEC-approved fund offerings.\n\nCrypto crime wave in Hong Kong and other locales may have spooked officials, experts say.\n\nAsian regulators could be defending home turf, the fastest growing ETF market in the world.\n\nFor all the excitement greeting the approval of Bitcoin ETFs this month, there was one group that was underwhelmed by the breakthrough offerings \u2014 Asian regulators.\n\nNo sooner had exchange traded funds from Fidelity, Ark Invest, and BlackRock\u2019s iShares unit hit the market in early January than finance watchdogs in South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand warned brokerages not to let their clients invest in the overseas offerings.\n\nMoreover, Taiwanese regulators said that indices tracked by ETFs must comprise \u201csecurities,\u201d which doesn\u2019t include Bitcoin under the island nation\u2019s rules.\n\nBlocking funds cleared by the US Securities and Exchange Commission surprised market players. Asia is the fastest growing ETF market in the world, and usually regulators wave funds through with little fuss.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cOutright bans of US-approved ETFs are basically unprecedented,\u201d said Jason Titman, the COO of Swyftx, an Australian crypto exchange. \u201cIt\u2019s a bold move by these jurisdictions and it\u2019s difficult to unpick the logic.\u201d\n\nOne rationale\n\nProtecting retail investors from the predatory practices of fraudsters may be a key reason for the action. Fighting crypto crime has become an urgent cause across the continent.\n\nSo, too, perhaps, is fending off Wall Street\u2019s offerings to give home grown efforts time to catch up.\n\nJustin d\u2019Anethan, a Hong Kong-based senior executive at Keyrock, a cryptocurrency market maker, told DL News there was a rationale behind the regulators\u2019 cautious approach.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a question of how those ETFs fit within the existing digital assets regulation, and how they monitor both retail and professional interaction with crypto,\u201d d\u2019Anethan said.\n\nCriminal activities\n\nJust this week, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime released a report that found more than $17 billion in USDT, the stablecoin issued by Tether, was connected to criminal activities across Southeast and East Asia during a one-year period ending last September.\n\nAnd law enforcement officials in Hong Kong are scrambling to shut down rogue crypto exchanges that are suspected of fleecing hundreds of millions of dollars from unwitting investors.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Asian regulators fear the US Bitcoin ETFs, which racked up $10 billion in volume their first three days of trading, may trigger a stampede of investors before safeguards can be installed.\n\nThen again, there may be another motivation \u2014 protecting home markets.\n\n$1 trillion ETF market\n\nOver the last five years, the Asia Pacific region has become the fastest growing market for exchange traded funds, according to Euroclear, a Belgian financial services firm.\n\nThe uptake of ETFs, which are listed products that track securities and indexes and trade like stocks, has jumped almost 19% in Asia compared to about 14% in the rest of the world. Asian investors have poured more $1 trillion into ETFs, Euroclear said, citing data from PwC.\n\n\u2018The negativity might just be buying time for launches on their own terms and with their own venues.\u2019 \u2014 Justin D\u2019Anethan, Keyrock\n\nTitman suspects government officials in several countries are politicising digital assets and ploughing the ground for their own crypto-linked products on local exchanges.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of their decisions actually doing much to protect anyone other than incumbents,\u201d he said.\n\nd\u2019Anethan agreed.\n\n\u201cThe negativity might just be buying time for launches on their own terms and with their own venues,\u201d he said.\n\nIn any event, it\u2019s striking to see regulators on a continent known for its freewheeling capitalism turn away offerings from firms such as Ark Invest and BlackRock, the world\u2019s top investment house with $10 trillion in assets under management.\n\nOn January 12, the day after BlackRock launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust, South Korea\u2019s Financial Service Commission warned brokerages that selling US spot price Bitcoin ETFs could be illegal in local markets.\n\nIt said such action may \u201cviolate the existing government stance on virtual assets and the Capital Markets Act.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the commission also said regulations on virtual assets are being established.\n\n\u201cWe plan to further review them as there are overseas cases, such as in the United States,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThere was some pushback, and confusion.\n\nOn January 19, Seong Tae-yoon, the head of policy in the office of President Yoon Suek Yeol, said during a press briefing that the financial regulator should reconsider its position.\n\nExercise extreme caution\n\nMeanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said on Tuesday investment firms cannot offer the US Bitcoin ETFs to retail investors.\n\nAn official told a Singapore media outlet that those who choose to trade in overseas markets \u201cmust exercise extreme caution\u201d.\n\nThe same day, Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commissions said it has \u201cno plan to allow spot bitcoin ETFs in Thailand\u201d for the time being.\n\nIt recommended investors seeking access to crypto tap the nine licensed companies providing such investment services in Thailand.\n\n\u2018Denying people access to a product that the world\u2019s largest investment managers are recommending to wealthy clients doesn\u2019t achieve much.\u2019 \u2014 Jason Titman, Swyftx\n\nIf there is anywhere Bitcoin spot price ETFs may first take root it\u2019s Hong Kong. Back in 2022, CSOP Asset Management launched the first Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs in the marketplace.\n\nNow local lawmakers such as legislator Johnny Ng are calling for the approval of the same type of spot price ETFs the US just approved.\n\nIndeed, crypto advocates are urging authorities to speed up the approval process.\n\nCrypto flexes\n\nRegulators in other locales may also feel pressure as crypto flexes in a new bull market. Even though Bitcoin has backslid more than 10% in the last seven days, the top cryptocurrency has soared more than 89% in the last 12 months.\n\nWith onetime Wall Street crypto critics such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink now trumpeting the value of Bitcoin, retail investors may increasingly clamour for a regulated means of accessing the asset class.\n\nIf Asian nations are not going to permit their own fund providers from offering up Bitcoin ETFs, then it will become harder for regulators to justify blocking access to products from US firms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly proper for national regulators to protect ordinary investors and I fully accept that parts of the industry need to mature,\u201d Swyftx\u2019s Titman said.\n\n\u201cBut denying people access to a product that the world\u2019s largest investment managers are recommending to wealthy clients doesn\u2019t achieve much, other than put ordinary investors at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\nGot a story about crypto in Asia?

        "content": "Introduction\n\nOn Jan. 10, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the trading of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, an event many saw as the opening of floodgates for institutional and retail capital into the Bitcoin market. This approval came after years of anticipation and multiple rejections, highlighting the regulatory hurdles that Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have faced in their journey toward mainstream acceptance\u200b.\n\nIn their first week of trading, these ETFs saw a surge in investor interest, as evidenced by the substantial trading volumes and inflows. CryptoSlate reported that on the first day of trading alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw trading volumes exceeding $4 billion, indicating a strong market appetite for these new financial products. This debut was significant in terms of the sheer volume of trade and in setting a precedent for the type of regulated Bitcoin exposure that investors can now access.\n\nIntroducing these ETFs is not merely a new investment vehicle; it marks a paradigm shift in how Bitcoin is perceived in the financial world. For the first time, investors have the opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated framework, providing a more accessible means to invest in this digital asset. The implications of this shift are far-reaching, extending beyond the crypto market to impact traditional financial markets as well.\n\nIn this report, CryptoSlate will dive deep into the first five days of the ETFs\u2019 trading, analyzing their impact on the market. The report will cover the trading performance of individual ETFs, focusing on significant players like BlackRock and Grayscale and the broader market implications of these new investment tools.\n\nThis report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs is reshaping the investment landscape for Bitcoin and what it means for the future of digital asset trading."

        "content": "Ether is in the spotlight and Donald Trump Nfts on the Bitcoin Blockchain. You're watching Coin Desk Daily. I'm your host, Jen Sani. The last week has been all about Bitcoin on the back of the spot, Bitcoin ETF News. But analysts and traders are also watching Ether closely in 2023 Ether underperformed Bitcoin and now analysts are saying that investors will likely have a re look at the second largest Cryptocurrency by market cap this year as it is still the world's leading smart contract Blockchain with key upgrades lined up in a weekly newsletter. Coinbase said quote last week, Bitcoin ETF news proved to be a boon for Ether M which briefly spiked above $2700 reaching the highest price since May 2022. And there are reasons to be even more optimistic about its near term future. For one, several of the firms behind the Bitcoin ETF S including Blackrock and Van Eck are also plotting Ether based spot ETF S end quote. But JP Morgan thinks there are still some challenges ahead. According to the investment bank. The probability of the sec approving a spot E ETF by May is no more than 50% JP Morgan points to lawsuits against crypto exchanges, offering staking services for proof of stake blockchains including Ethereum. They say that this makes the approval of a spot Ether ETF more challenging. And Donald Trump is out with his latest NFT project. The former US president's NFT venture announced on X that collectors who purchased 100 of his mugshot NFTS, which cost $99 will get a unique card in the form of an ordinal on the Bitcoin Blockchain. But buyer beware the ordinals and the 100 Nfts you have to buy to get the ordinal cannot be traded by owners until December 2024. The thread on X said the restriction is meant to reduce their appeal as investment vehicles. That's it for coin desk daily, get more updates on coindesk.com and we'll see you next time."

        "content": "Bitcoin price has crashed by over 12% in the past week to fall from $46,700 to $40,901 at the time of writing.\n\nPantera Capital\u2019s report suggests that the market is set to move into Phase 2, wherein altcoins will outperform BTC.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance has hit a three-month low and is close to falling below commanding 50% of the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin price was expected to witness an extensive bull run following the approval of spot BTC ETFs, but, surprisingly, this did not happen. In fact, the biggest cryptocurrency in the world is trending downwards at the moment, lurking around monthly lows. This might give the altcoins a very crucial opening to take over BTC.\n\nBitcoin to lose in Phase 2\n\nPantera Capital, one of the largest and oldest crypto-focused hedge funds, released its report for what to expect in 2024, and it does not seem too good for Bitcoin. Bitcoin and altcoin rallies tend to move in cycles, with the first phase generally being the former riding the bullishness and the second phase witnessing altcoins taking over the market.\n\nBitcoin outperforms altcoins in Phase 1 and vice versa in Phase 2. This phenomenon was witnessed in the past during the 2015-2018 bull run and then again during the 2019 - 2022 bull run cycle. In both cases, the last year ended up being Phase 2, where alts outperformed BTC.\n\nBitcoin bull cycles\n\nComing to the macro bull cycle that began in 2023, Bitcoin has already witnessed a 3X growth while altcoins collectively witnessed only 2X. In the overall crypto market growth, BTC had a 67% share while alts had a 33% contribution.\n\nBitcoin and altcoin growth share\n\nThis might change going forward since BTC is surprisingly losing the bullish momentum rather rapidly despite the Bitcoin halving coming up soon. This event might be BTC\u2019s last shot at a bull run. Otherwise, the altcoins will likely see more growth this year.\n\nBitcoin loses dominance, literally\n\nBitcoin's dominance in the crypto market is coming down along with the price. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price can be seen hovering around $41,000, with the potential of further decline still on the cards. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below the neutral line, and the cryptocurrency failed the bullish divergence as well.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nThis resulted in Bitcoin\u2019s dominance falling from over 54% to 50.9% at the moment. With the dominance being at a three-month low, the altcoins are already clearly taking over, commanding the other 50%. If this dominance falls below 50%, BTC might be on track to being surpassed by alts.\n\nBitcoin dominance\n\nThis could also result in the Bitcoin price falling through the $40,000 psychological support level and creating a new year-to-date low of around $35,000. When that happens, it is completely dependent on the response of the market to the halving event."

Traders netted a profit above 57%. If the profit-taking streaks of BTC traders continues, it is likely that whales take profits on their BTC holdings, increasing the selling pressure on the asset.\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant data, Bitcoin is in the distribution phase and the asset is not distrbited to retailers fully. A short-term correction in BTC price is likely, according to CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju.

        "title": "Bitcoin's spot ETFs make a splash, but can their AUM surpass gold ETFs? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The surge of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has become a focal point in financial markets, fueling speculation about their potential to outshine traditional assets like gold. ETFs are conveniently bought and sold on regular stock exchanges, simplifying the process for everyday investors to trade Bitcoin using their standard brokerage accounts.\n\nAnother benefit is that these instruments are subject to regulatory oversight, breaking down barriers for mutual funds and professional finance managers who were previously unable to hold and manage digital assets directly.\n\nImpact of spot ETF Bitcoin on the underlying spot market\n\nETFs have a unique way of maintaining their prices in line with the value of the assets they represent, involving a process called creation and redemption. This process plays a crucial role in managing the number of ETF shares available in the market and ensuring that the ETF price stays closely tied to the value of the assets it represents.\n\nSimilar to the prices of other items that can be bought and sold, the price of an ETF is influenced by how much people want to buy it (demand) and how much people want to sell it (supply). Sometimes, the demand for an ETF can be very high or very low, causing its price to move away from the actual value of the assets it holds.\n\nTo prevent significant differences between the ETF price and the value of its assets, there are special players in the financial world called authorized participants. These participants can create or redeem ETF shares based on market demand. Creating new shares increases the supply, and redeeming shares decreases it. By doing this, they can help keep the ETF price in check and avoid significant deviations from the true value of the assets it represents.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs surpass expectations in volumes\n\nTrading for spot Bitcoin ETFs began on Jan. 11, and these products amassed a record-high $14 billion in volume in the first five days, a feat unmatched by other commodity ETFs.\n\nAnother way to put the bitcoin ETF flows in ETF context (besides showing their #s relative to past new launches) is how they stack up to ALL ETFs in past 1 week flows. Even after four days two of them are in Top 5 and three in Top 10, up there w the studs $VOO, $QQQ et al. pic.twitter.com/oduhktEqwG \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 18, 2024\n\nAs highlighted by Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, the only asset class that outshone Bitcoin in terms of volumes was the one tracking either the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100 indexes. To put things in perspective, the United States stock market capitalization stands at $52 trillion, more than 60 times larger than Bitcoin\u2019s $810 billion.\n\nMore importantly, the combined assets under management (AUM) of Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF issuers stands at $2.8 billion, surpassing the sum of silver, crude oil and broad diversified commodities \u2014 leaving gold as the only remaining competitor.\n\nA post on X (formerly Twitter) by James Van Straten, lead analyst at CryptoSlate, depicts the precious metal gold as the absolute leader in the commodities segment, holding $96 billion worth under its ETF instruments.\n\nAs the SEC has recognized #Bitcoin as a commodity by this latest filing, see the link below.\n\n\n\n.@akibablade, and I did some digging.\n\n\n\nIn terms of AUM for all commodity ETFs, #Bitcoin would rank 2nd, with a combined value of $28 billion, with 10 ETFs, behind Gold.\n\n\n\nAs of now,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/2RZbLTPz1I \u2014 James Van Straten (@jvs_btc) January 18, 2024\n\nHowever, the AUM of Bitcoin ETFs currently represents only 3.5% of Bitcoin\u2019s current market capitalization. In contrast, even if one excludes the 63% of gold\u2019s AUM used in jewelry, coins, electronics and other applications, its ETF industry encompasses merely 2% of gold\u2019s remaining $5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nGold is not the only direct competitor in the ETF industry\n\nWhile the growth of Bitcoin ETFs has outpaced that of commodities-based ETFs, the bond market tells a different story, amassing an impressive $2 trillion in AUM globally. Similarly, the S&P 500 ETF industry\u2019s AUM surpasses $1 trillion, underscoring the enduring appeal of traditional equities.\n\nRelated: Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: \u2018Revolutionary change\u2019 or colossal \u2018dud\u2019?\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs haven\u2019t surpassed gold\u2019s market cap, the recent growth signals a compelling narrative. The comparison with commodities like oil, silver, and gold underscores Bitcoin\u2019s growing influence as a legitimate asset class.\n\nAs Bitcoin matures, the potential for a market cap above $1 trillion becomes increasingly plausible, affirming its position as a transformative force in the financial realm.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

In its short existence, USBTC appears to have defaulted on a loan and paid two government fines, one for committing securities violations,\u201d JCapital wrote.\n\nAdditionally, JCapital claimed that USBTC\u2019s CEO Michael Ho \u2014 now Hut\u2019s chief strategy officer \u2014 hid his relationship with stock promoters called the Honig Group, which was accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 of engaging in \u201cclassic pump and dump\u201d and \u201cfraudulent schemes.\u201d Honig settled the charges and agreed to be banned from trading penny stocks.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we strongly believe that [HUT} shareholders are likely to feel the pain of being on the wrong side of an over-levered pump-and-dump, only to be left holding the most inefficient Bitcoin miner, which is unprofitable even at a Bitcoin price of over $60,000,\u201d the report concluded.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to verify the short report,\u201d one crypto community member on X (formerly Twitter), Cantonese Cat, remarked in a Jan. 18 post. \u201cMany are selling out of panic. It could be real, it could be panic.\u201d\n\nA Hut 8 spokesperson told Cointelegraph it was in the process of reviewing the JCapital report and would provide updates on the matter when it deemed appropriate.\n\n\"[JCapital Research] is a self-proclaimed group of biased activists who clearly disclose that they will profit if a company\u2019s share price declines,\" said Hut 8 in response.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to JCapital to verify the claims made in its report.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners in \u2018selling mode,\u2019 dumping $450M BTC in a day\n\nThe report arrived on the same day that Hut CEO Jaime Leverton rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq headquarters in New York, something the firm said was conducted to \u201ccelebrate the completion of its all-stock merger\u201d between Hut 8 and USBTC.\n\nWe\u2019re live at the @nasdaq headquarters in New York getting ready to ring the Opening Bell to celebrate the completion of our merger alongside the Hut 8 Corp. team and Board of Directors!

The biggest digital coin by market cap is now trading for $40,640, having plunged by almost 4% in the past day, according to CoinGecko.\n\nOver the past week, BTC has shed more than 6% of its value. Last week, the asset increasingly dubbed \"digital gold\" was fast closing in on $49,000 per coin for the first time since 2021.\n\nBTC's tumble comes after the historic approval of spot BTC exchange traded funds (ETFs).

        "content": "Hong Kong is set to develop a more flexible regime for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), even though the US leads in both approval speed and market size, experts said.\n\nA key difference between Hong Kong\u2019s proposed rules for spot cryptocurrency ETFs and products approved in the US is that Hong Kong will allow both cash and in-kind subscriptions. Under such rules, participating dealers can directly use bitcoin to subscribe to or redeem the ETF\u2019s shares, whereas in the US, such subscriptions and redemptions are only allowed with cash.\n\nThe different approach reflects a divergence of virtual asset regulatory frameworks, where the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u201cappears reluctant to allow licensed dealers to touch bitcoin\u201d when subscribing for and redeeming ETF shares because spot bitcoin trades are unregulated in the US, according to Andrew Fei, a partner at King & Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong.\n\nRegulators in Hong Kong last month said that they will allow retail access to spot virtual asset ETFs, and are willing to accept applications from funds hoping to offer such products to the public."

The last update was in October, when the account impersonating the elusive figure behind Bitcoin made headlines by sharing reflections on the future of the cryptocurrency, deviating from the content of the original white paper. However, this post was deleted shortly afterward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest post, shared just seven hours ago, took a different tone, offering only a brief greeting to the world.

According to Community Notes accompanying the post, there are claims that Craig Wright, the controversial figure who previously asserted he was Nakamoto, once controlled the account. Still, a disclaimer beneath the post asserts that the account is unrelated to Bitcoin or its anonymous creator.\n\nBitcoin's main mystery\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, credited with the creation of Bitcoin, remains shrouded in mystery, with only tidbits of information available about the person or group behind the pseudonym. While theories abound, including the late Hal Finney and Australian programmer Craig Wright, the true identity of Nakamoto remains unconfirmed.\n\nAs the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments, the question on everyone's mind is: Will the real Satoshi Nakamoto ever come back?\n\nThe latest post offers no clear answers, leaving room for speculation and fueling the intrigue that has surrounded the elusive creator since the inception of BTC."

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) the previous day.\n\nThe approval generated considerable excitement and discussion within the cryptocurrency community and beyond. As a result, there was a marked increase in public interest in Bitcoin , as reflected in the Google Trends data.\n\nFor me google trends = retail interest So retail got in post #Bitcoin ETF approval, market fleeced them during the first two trading days.

As such, this upcoming halving is drawing attention. Stakeholders are now speculating on the halving\u2019s potential impact on BTC\u2018s value and the broader market dynamics.\n\nBTC Searches Seen Soaring Post-ETF Approval\n\nIn the year leading up to the week of January 15 to 21 2023, Google Trends data shows a rise in the popularity of the search term \u201cBitcoin.\u201d According to Google Trends, which rates search interest from 1 to 100, the term had a score of 55 during that period.\n\nThis system is based on the ratio of searches for a specific term to the total volume of searches in a certain time frame and location. A score of 100 represents the highest level of popularity for the term. By the end of March 2023, the score for \u201cBitcoin\u201d had increased to 65, reflecting a growing curiosity about and engagement with the cryptocurrency.\n\nBTC Search Popularity Skyrockets in Early 2024 After a Muted 2023\n\nThroughout much of 2023, public interest in the term \u201cBitcoin\u201d as measured by Google Trends remained relatively subdued. The lowest point came in the week of October 8th to 14th, with a search interest score of just 35 out of a possible 100. However, following this lull, there was a noticeable uptick in curiosity about Bitcoin, leading to a score of 61 by the end of October.\n\nThe peak of interest in 2023 occurred in the week of December 3rd to 9th, with the term \u201cBitcoin\u201d scoring a notable 70 out of 100. Yet, it wasn\u2019t until the second week of January 2024 that the search term for Bitcoin reached an unprecedented level of popularity, achieving a perfect score of 100.\n\nA 90-Day Google Trends Analysis\n\nA 90-day analysis by Google Trends highlights significant changes in the global search popularity of \u201cBitcoin.\u201d On January 11, 2024, the term achieved a peak interest score of 100. However, by January 15, this score had dropped sharply to 41. This pattern reflects the initial excitement around the spot Bitcoin ETFs and the subsequent decline in fervor as the buzz around these financial products began to fade.\n\nAs of the third week of January 2024, El Salvador, where BTC is legal tender, leads the world in searches for \u201cBitcoin\u201d. Meanwhile, Nigeria, Switzerland, Austria, and the Netherlands are also showing strong interest.\n\nThe topics and queries related to \u201cBitcoin\u201d during this period are predominantly centered around ETFs. \u201cExchange-traded fund\u201d has emerged as a popular related term, along with significant interest in the \u201cU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201d Other notable topics include cryptocurrencies like \u201cSolana\u201d and \u201cTether,\u201d as well \u201cBitcoin Dominance.\u201d\n\nGoogle Trends recorded a peak score of 55 out of 100 for \"bitcoin\" during Jan.\n\n7-13, 2024. Interest surged on Jan. 11 after the SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Research attention is now on Bitcoin's upcoming reward halving.#Bitcoin #BTC #GoogleTrends #CryptoNews \u2014 Crypto Multistream (@CryptoMStream) January 17, 2024\n\nCommon search queries include terms such as \u201cBitcoin ETF approval,\u201d \u201cBitcoin ETFs,\u201d \u201cBitcoin ETF news,\u201d \u201cBitcoin ETF approved,\u201d and \u201cETF Bitcoin.\u201d Additionally, trending topics linked to \u201cBitcoin\u201d are also focused on financial entities like \u201cBlackrock\u201d and market-related terms such as \u201cBitcoin price.\u201d This suggests a heightened interest in the investment and market aspects of Bitcoin following recent developments in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nDecline in Interest for BTC Halving Post-ETF Approval As Bitcoin approaches its next major event, the reward halving anticipated in April 2024, Google Trends data showcases a notable spike in interest for the specific query \u201cBitcoin halving.\u201d This term, reflecting focused attention on the upcoming halving milestone, reached its highest popularity with a score of 100 on January 11, 2024, coinciding with the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. However, the intense interest observed immediately following the ETF approvals has since witnessed a significant decline. The countries showing the most significant interest in the \u201cBitcoin halving\u201d term were Slovenia, Cyprus, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Austria. Despite this initial surge in queries, by January 15, 2024, search interest for \u201cBitcoin halving\u201d had fallen to 49. Bitcoin sells off after ETF approval, losing support at $45K and $43K. Price falls below $42K amid Binance ban in India. Keep an eye on $40K level for potential bearish turn. #Bitcoin #ETF #Binance #India \" \u2014 Flavius Co. \ud83e\uddcc\u221eS (@flama_co) January 13, 2024 This fluctuation in search interest underscores the short-term nature of public attention, particularly in the often volatile cryptosphere. While the ETF approvals initially heightened curiosity about Bitcoin\u2019s future, this appears to have fallen as the immediate buzz subsided. Bitcoin\u2019s Influence in FinTech Amid Fluctuating Public Interest The recent surge in search popularity for Bitcoin highlights the cryptocurrency\u2019s expanding influence. This spike in interest is a testament to Bitcoin\u2019s increasingly prominent role in mainstream economic discourse. This attention reflects not just the speculative allure of Bitcoin but also its integration in the future of finance. Bitcoin is going to $500k after the\n\nSpot ETF is approval. Here is the\n\nevidence \u2013 When Gold ETF was approved, it\u2019s\n\nmcap was around $2 Trillion.

The asset\u2019s inherent qualities of being censorship-resistant and decentralized play a significant role in its attractiveness. These features, coupled with its potential as a hedge against traditional financial systems, contribute to its sustained interest. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, only time will unveil the enduring impact and appeal of Bitcoin. Its ability to adapt to changing market dynamics, regulation, and technological changes will be crucial in determining its long-term position in the financial ecosystem."

Discover SCENE\n\nIs Grayscale dumping billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin? Blame it on the ETFs.\n\nBitcoin has taken a hard hit this week, falling by over 14%, despite the historic approval of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) just over seven days ago. And it appears that Grayscale, the digital asset manager owned by crypto behemoth Digital Currency Group, may have a lot to do with that.\n\nInvestors in Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), recently converted to a Bitcoin ETF following SEC approval, have been exiting their positions in droves, and it has analysts shocked at the size of the sell-off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF started trading last week, along with 10 other similar products. Prior, the Trust had been a closed-end fund where investors could not redeem their shares for BTC. But now that it\u2019s an ETF, investors are cashing out\u2014big time.\n\nOver half a billion dollars was cashed out in the first few days. In the last five days, more than $2.2 billion has left the fund, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nAll the other ETFs are seeing inflows. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the current winner with $1.2 billion in inflows.\n\nSenior ETF analyst at Bloomberg told Decrypt it was \u201ckind of shocking\u201d to see GBTC experience such big outflows.\n\nWHEN WILL THE BLEEDING STOP? I don't know, but this this is some serious daily outflows for The Nine to have to battle every single day.. they've done a great job so far but damn its a lot to ask.. pic.twitter.com/LqwPRETrQf \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 19, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe reason for the outflows, simply put, is down to traders exiting their positions to take gains after having previously been locked in to the fund.\n\nGBTC also has the highest fee of any of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs at 1.5%. While BlackRock\u2019s IBIT stands at 0.12% (it will raise it to 0.25% in 12 months, though.)\n\nThis is another reason, industry observers say, that investors would want to cash out.\n\nInvestors fleeing GBTC is, in turn, leading Grayscale to shift large amounts of BTC to its custodian, American crypto exchange Coinbase, to sell\u2014causing the price of Bitcoin to dip. On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that Grayscale has sent roughly $500 million in Bitcoin to Coinbase in just the last six hours alone.\n\nEuropean asset manager CoinShares\u2019 head of research, James Butterfill, said the outflows likely explain BTC\u2019s price dip.\n\n\u201cFurther price weakness depends on when GBTC holders stop selling,\u201d he told Decrypt over text message, while also acknowledging that GBTC\u2019s fees are relatively much higher than competition.\n\nDespite the outflows, Grayscale told Decrypt that the fund was a success due to sheer trading volume.\n\n\u201cGBTC has been dominating trading volume, is the leading risk transfer vehicle, and has had the best performance of all spot Bitcoin ETFs since its launch,\u201d John Hoffman, Grayscale\u2019s managing director of sales and distribution, said.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

In what was likely the most exciting financial product launch in history, the SEC approved 10 spot Bitcoin ETF products for trading in U.S. marketplaces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn reaction, BTC prices rose to a new multi-year high, reaching $49,102. The market then fell 18% over the weekend, reaching fresh year-to-date lows of $40,236.\n\nAs with any important event, holders of Bitcoins enjoy debating whether it was priced in or not.\n\nIn this regard, Julio Moreno, the head of research at CryptoQuant, debunks the widely circulated narrative that the Bitcoin price drop was caused by Grayscale's GBTC selling Bitcoin.\n\nThere's a narrative circulating that the current Bitcoin price correction is due to GBTC selling Bitcoin. IS NOT.\n\n\n\nGBTC has sold about 60K Bitcoin. The other ETFs combined have net purchased about 72K Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe selling has come from Bitcoin holders (short-term traders and\u2026 \u2014 Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) January 19, 2024\n\nBefore being converted to an ETF from a trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was one of the only options for stock traders in the United States to obtain exposure to Bitcoin price swings without having to purchase the actual cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile GBTC has seen remarkable outflows after its uplisting into an ETF, a chunk of these have been from investors moving to lower-fee ETFs.\n\nMoreno highlighted that, while GBTC sold approximately 60,000 Bitcoins, other Bitcoin ETFs net purchased roughly 72,000 Bitcoins, thus offsetting the sales of BTC from Grayscale's GBTC.\n\nHe attributes the volatility in Bitcoin's price to selling by Bitcoin holders (short-term traders and whales) who took profits following last year's surge, noting that the ETF approval might just be the \"sell-the-news\" event.\n\nWhat on-chain data says\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin's price drop might have been driven by both derivatives leverage and spot profit taking.\n\nHowever, several metrics in both the on-chain and derivatives domains suggest that a non-trivial portion of Bitcoin investors did treat the ETF approval as a sell-the-news event.\n\nWhile there are other key driving factors behind the interim volatility, both futures and options markets have seen a meaningful uptick in open interest (OI) since mid-October, according to Glassnode.\n\nOpen interest in both markets remains around multi-year highs, showing that leverage is rising and becoming a more dominant force in markets.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC was up 0.58% in the last 24 hours to $41,543, per CoinMarketCap data."
