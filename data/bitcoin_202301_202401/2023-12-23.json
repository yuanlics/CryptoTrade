        "title": "Crypto\u2019s 2023 was marred by fraud and scandal. It was its best year ever - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nCrypto\u2019s 14th year in existence was one marred by scandal, bankruptcy, fraud and regulatory squabbling. It still may have been the industry\u2019s best year ever.\n\nThe cast of \u201cCrypto 2023\u201d starred figures that are now practically synonymous with fraud: Sam Bankman-Fried, Changpeng Zhao, Alex Mashinsky, and, less prominently, Heather \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein (aka \u2018Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde\u2019).\n\nDespite all the bad press, the young industry notched some notable wins.\n\nBitcoin, the crypto\u2019s bellwether asset, is up 160% for the year. Two high-profile court cases came down in the industry\u2019s favor. And a long-awaited approval for a mainstream investment product is expected in January, potentially flooding the scene with new investors.\n\nLike the rest of the financial world, digital assets got a boost from an improving macroeconomic picture in cooling inflation, a growing economy, and a long-awaited end in sight for the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes.\n\n\u201cIt was the year of crypto\u2019s resiliency,\u201d Kyla Curley, a crypto expert and partner at global advisory StoneTurn, tells CNN.\n\nOne big component of that resiliency is how US authorities, particularly the Department of Justice, flexed their enforcement muscles on crypto, even in the absence of clear regulations.\n\n\u201cFraud is fraud,\u201d Curley says, \u201cRegardless of the technology or the industry \ufeff\u2026 you cannot stop human nature. When it comes down to it, people will find a way to exploit the rules.\u201d\n\nThe bad-apple case for optimism\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, left, was convicted on seven counts of fraud in early November. Two weeks later, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges in a settlement with US authorities. Eduardo Munoz/Costas Baltas/Reuters\n\nNo figure loomed quite as large over crypto in 2023 than Bankman-Fried, the entrepreneur once hailed as a visionary who was found guilty in November of orchestrating a yearslong, multibillion-dollar fraud through his FTX trading platform.\n\nThe trial of SBF, as he\u2019s widely known, was the spectacle of the year for crypto\u2019s biggest critics and its most strident fans.\n\nFor those inclined to cast crypto as an elaborate scam, the trial pulled back the curtain on the fly-by-night fraud underpinning FTX, which attracted millions of mainstream investors with its pitch as a beginner-friendly way to get into the emerging digital asset space. The rapid rise and fall of SBF is now Exhibit A for crypto detractors.\n\nOn the flip side, the crypto faithful who made SBF a into a billionaire pseudo-savior also cheered his conviction, casting the verdict as a an overdue purge of a bad apple.\n\nA couple of weeks after the verdict, US authorities notched another enforcement slam dunk. Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, the founder of the most popular crypto trading platform, Binance, pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges as part of a $4 billion settlement.\n\n\u201c2023 was a bad year for grifters and a good year for builders,\u201d says Faryar Shirzad, the chief policy officer for Coinbase. \u201cWe\u2019re going into 2024 with many of the worst of the grifters out of the market, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nIn the two weeks following CZ\u2019s guilty plea, bitcoin surged 23% to reach $44,000 \u2014 its highest level in 18 months, as investors looked ahead to more positive news on the horizon.\n\nBitcoin bulls dig in\n\nThe main event for crypto in 2024 could come as soon next month, when US regulators are expected to greenlight applications for the very first spot bitcoin ETF, or exchange traded fund, in the American market.\n\nPut simply, a spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to track the price of bitcoin without actually owning the digital currency. That\u2019s appealing for mainstream investors for a few reasons. First, it gives everyday investors who are wary of crypto a relatively safe way to dip their toe in the notoriously volatile market.\n\nETFs also trade on traditional stock exchanges, which means investors can access them through their tried-and-true brokerage rather than creating a new account in the crypto-verse. And, of course, the prospect of regulatory oversight adds another layer of protection and transparency.\n\nThe upshot: There could be a lot of new money flowing into bitcoin very soon.\n\nAdding to that bullish sentiment: the bitcoin halving, or, more menacingly, \u201cthe halvening.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s often a buy-the-hype-sell-the-news kind of event, the halving does tend to push bitcoin higher. Essentially, bitcoin is a finite asset, and every four years the algorithm reduces the number of new tokens that can enter circulation by half (hence the name).\n\n\u201cThe \u2018halving\u2019 is the ultimate geek event for Bitcoiners in 2024,\u201d Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, said in a statement. \u201cSo if history repeats itself \u2026 we may not see the peak in Bitcoin until sometime in 2025, with 2024 acting as an entr\u00e9e to the main event.\u201d\n\nTrenchev said the \u201ctwin-turbo boost\u201d of the spot ETF approval and the halving, expected in the spring, should propel bitcoin to $100,000 \u2014 a 45% jump over its all-time high of 69,000, reached in November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe road to $100,000 will be lined with unexpected potholes and double-digit declines as Bitcoin,\u201d said Trenchev. \u201cTo borrow a phrase from one its biggest detractors Warren Buffett, \u2018transfers money from the impatient to the patient.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor an even more bullish prediction, look to Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital and a longtime bitcoin evangelist.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ends the year at $140,000,\u201d he told the digital news outlet Semafor."

        "title": "If History Repeats Itself, I Expect Bitcoin to Surge Even Higher in 2024. Here's Why. - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Looking back at 2023, a key development has been the resurgence of the cryptocurrency market. The industry's current valuation of over $1.6 trillion is about 100% higher than it was nearly 12 months ago.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most valuable digital asset, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), has also benefited tremendously. But bigger gains could be on the horizon.\n\nEven though Bitcoin has climbed 154% in 2023 (as of Dec. 20), I expect this top cryptocurrency to surge even higher in 2024. Here's why.\n\nA major catalyst for Bitcoin on the horizon\n\nUnlike Ethereum, Bitcoin operates what is known as a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This means that so-called miners must expend computational power and electricity (the \"work\") to win the right to approve transactions to the blockchain. For this effort, miners receive a reward in the form of newly created Bitcoin.\n\nAbout every four years, the reward that miners get for doing this essential task gets cut in half, in an event known as a \"halving.\" Bitcoin and crypto observers are likely aware that the next halving event is slated to take place in April 2024. After this point, miners will get 3.125 new coins each time they approve transactions.\n\nWhy is this so important for Bitcoin? Well, if history is any indication, Bitcoin's price is poised to continue soaring in the next 12 months and perhaps even longer.\n\nThe last Bitcoin halving took place in May 2020. In the two months before, the crypto's price rose 65%. And in the 18 months after, Bitcoin skyrocketed 616% to reach its all-time high of under $69,000 in November 2021. A similar situation played out around the halving events in 2016 and 2012.\n\nConceptually, it makes sense why this has typically been a bullish situation. Over the past decade, demand for Bitcoin has increased. This is due to it becoming more widely adopted as a store of value. The fact that Bitcoin is also getting recognition as a legitimate financial asset from incumbent institutions, corporations, and governments also helps.\n\nAt the same time that demand rises, new Bitcoin entering the market has decreased every four or so years. Restricting supply is the other key ingredient, and maybe the more important one, that drives up the digital asset's price. The Bitcoin halving is a key aspect of the blockchain network, and it supports the enforcement of there ever only being 21 million coins in circulation.\n\nInvestors should maintain a long-term mindset\n\nBefore you rush to buy Bitcoin in the hopes of generating outsized returns in 2024, it's worth mentioning that investors should still maintain a long-term perspective. This is an asset that deserves a 10-year mental outlook, not a 12-month one.\n\nBitcoin will continue to be volatile, even though it has historically done a fantastic job of rewarding investors. By staying focused on the next several years, you can have the conviction needed to avoid selling at the wrong times, and consequently hurting your portfolio's potential returns.\n\nThe economic backdrop also can't be ignored, as things are still very uncertain. While the Federal Reserve might feel confident enough to cut rates in 2024, the U.S. could still experience a harsh recession. I honestly don't think anyone has any clue what the economic situation will look like next year. If things go south, Bitcoin could be negatively affected as capital flees to what people view as safer and less risky assets.\n\nThese points are only made to help investors temper expectations. Nonetheless, now might be one of the best times to buy Bitcoin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin miners splash out $600mn in race to squeeze out rivals - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nCryptocurrency miners are spending heavily on the newest technology to earn more bitcoins, trying to gain market share and squeeze out rivals ahead of a halving of their rewards in around four months\u2019 time.\n\nMiners listed on the world\u2019s stock exchanges have this month committed to spending around $600mn on buying new chips and servers that are the keystone of the digital ledger underlying bitcoin, according to The Miner Mag, an industry data provider. The December amount is nearly half of the $1.3bn total committed for the year.\n\nThe burst of spending comes despite miners having suffered heavy losses in the 2022 crypto market crash. They are now trying to profit from the soaring price of bitcoin, which has surged to an 18-month high of more than $44,000.\n\nThe splurge also comes before a scheduled plan in April to halve the incentive scheme that verifies all bitcoin deals. Optimists hope the so-called \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a once every four year event to slow the circulation of bitcoins \u2014 will support further gains for the cryptocurrency next year but the move also threatens to undercut miners\u2019 shaky profitability.\n\n\u201cBuying equipment is not just an action in the bull market,\u201d said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at Foundry. Miners are \u201crealising that refreshing the fleet is what would keep them in business post-halving.\u201d\n\nMiners play a crucial role in bitcoin\u2019s operation, racing each other to verify new blocks of deals for its blockchain and taking on the role of deal guarantor. In return, the winner is rewarded with new tokens.\n\nHowever, the process has been heavily criticised for the huge carbon footprint it creates. According to Cambridge university, bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is today roughly equivalent to that of Poland or Malaysia.\n\nThe halving is expected to reshape industry economics, which have been deeply strained in the last two years by the high cost of energy and the falling price of coins. Now companies are spending big on new equipment, hoping to leave rivals on older machines struggling.\n\nNevada-based CleanSpark, a bitcoin mining firm that has committed roughly $280mn to mining equipment this year, is one prepared to accept a smaller financial reward in exchange for a larger slice of the market.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be dissimilar to when China banned mining [in 2021], everybody unplugged, and the percentage rewards skyrocketed for the miners that were still standing,\u201d said Matthew Schultz, executive chair at CleanSpark. \u201cThe companies that have made these investments [in new equipment] are likely the ones that survive,\u201d he added.\n\nBitcoin miners have already been pushed to their limits. Many invested during the bull run of 2020 and 2021, using debt and low interest rates to finance their expansion as the price of bitcoin soared to more than $69,000.\n\nHowever they were hit hard when bitcoin lost three-quarters of its value and energy prices soared. Companies including Core Scientific and Computer North filed for bankruptcy while others were forced to temporarily shut down operations or were paid by some US states not to mine bitcoin, in an effort to conserve energy.\n\nAnother, Marathon Digital, became a focus for short sellers after paying its former chief executive Merrick Okamoto just under $220mn in stock and missing its earnings targets.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rebound this year as market speculation intensifies that US regulators will approve a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nSupporters say approval would potentially unlock billions of dollars worth of capital from major Wall Street players like BlackRock and Fidelity and send the price of bitcoin much higher.\n\nEnthusiasts also note that the last halving, in May 2020, pushed bitcoin\u2019s price up by roughly 460 per cent over the subsequent 12 months.\n\nBitcoin miners share prices have responded to bitcoin\u2019s rising price: Riot Platforms is up 424 per cent this year and Marathon Digital is up 681 per cent. In Toronto, Bitfarms has risen 607 per cent this year and Hive Digital Technologies 232 per cent. In contrast, over the course of 2022 Riot and Marathon share prices fell by around 85 per cent and 90 per cent, respectively, while Bitfarms and Hive saw their share price decline by 91 per cent and 88 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe enthusiasm over the potential of a bitcoin ETF all of a sudden has opened up the ability to raise capital to upgrade equipment, so you\u2019ve seen this huge bulk buying spree,\u201d said Frank Holmes, executive chair of Hive, which itself committed $9mn to new equipment this month.\n\nBut hopes for a resurgence are still contingent on bitcoin\u2019s recent rally persisting. The SEC has given no indication it will approve an ETF, and end its decade-long policy of refusing all applications.\n\nMoreover miners are still plagued by real-world costs, notably energy.\n\nLatest figures pin the median cost to mine one bitcoin at around $17,000, but that could rise to as high as $34,000, according to The Miner Mag. It \u201cdoesn\u2019t leave much room\u201d for miners if bitcoin remains at its current price of roughly $42,000, said Wolfie Zhao, its head of research.\n\nBut some see it as a risk worth taking. Among them is Bitfarms, a Canadian-listed group, which this month set aside $95mn for new equipment.\n\n\u201cAs our market share goes up, and we get more bitcoins on a daily basis, our revenues and our cash flow should work out as well [as] if not better than in the status quo,\u201d said Geoffrey Morphy, Bitfarms chief executive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not maintaining [our market share], we\u2019re leapfrogging,\u201d he added."

        "content": "It's hard to believe that Bitcoin (BTC -6.04%) was in the depths of a brutal crypto winter just a year ago, falling as low as $16,735. Fast-forward to today, and Bitcoin is up more than 160% in 2023, hitting a yearly high of just over $43,000. By all accounts, the crypto winter has thawed.\n\nThis level of resurgence isn't uncommon for Bitcoin, especially after bear markets. However, it does raise the question: How much more momentum could Bitcoin have? Could it ride this wave and reach the coveted six-figure mark of $100,000 in 2024, or would that be too big of a jump too fast?\n\nGetting the lay of the land\n\nFor Bitcoin to reach $100,000, it would need to increase by another 130%. Considering Bitcoin has notched average yearly returns of 167% over the course of its existence, it is undoubtedly within the realm of possibility. But just how likely is it?\n\nTo answer this question holistically, we need to explore a handful of other developments, rather than just taking the average of Bitcoin's performance in years past. In doing so, we should be able to project Bitcoin's path in 2024 more confidently.\n\nTo reiterate, this is all pure speculation. But by taking a comprehensive view of data, recent trends, and history, one can hope to paint a reasonably accurate picture of Bitcoin's future.\n\nThe effect of the halving\n\nWhile Bitcoin's performance in 2023 was impressive, it doesn't take away from the importance of what's coming in 2024. Hardwired into Bitcoin's code are events known as halvings. Every time another 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain -- roughly every four years -- the amount of tokens paid to miners for validating transactions is cut by half. These halvings of the token supply growth rate alter the dynamics around Bitcoin's supply and demand.\n\nThe halving slated for April 2024 will cut Bitcoin's current growth rate of around 1.7% to just 0.85%. This might not sound like a big deal, but past data shows it profoundly affects Bitcoin's price.\n\nIn the previous years that halvings have taken place, Bitcoin's price has increased by an average of about 128% as the growth of the total token supply became more constrained. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, a 128% increase from today's prices would put it at just over $99,000.\n\nHistorically low supply\n\nWhile halvings have historically been catalysts for price appreciation to a degree that would push it close to the $100,000 mark, additional developments in the Bitcoin universe could put that $100,000 level well within reach. Reason No. 1 is related to an existing supply crunch, which will only be amplified by the halving.\n\nBitcoin investors are notoriously stubborn about buying and holding through market fluctuations. Due to this behavior, investors have accumulated more Bitcoin at a historic rate over the last few years, pushing it into unprecedented territory. Data shows that the number of tokens available on exchanges increased until March 2020 (Bitcoin's last halving), peaking at nearly 3.2 million coins. But during this latest period of accumulation, the tradable supply has shrunk. It currently sits at 2.3 million tokens, a level last seen in the spring of 2018. As such, the upcoming halving will be the first in Bitcoin's history when fewer coins are on the market than during the previous one.\n\nNew game changers will add fresh demand\n\nFor years, Bitcoin investors claimed that deep-pocketed institutions would join the game. Well, now they're here. Some of Wall Street's biggest names, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, are awaiting approval to sponsor spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With a blessing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looking more likely by the day, the ETF will open the way for Bitcoin to be added to pensions, individual retirement accounts, and 401(k) savings accounts.\n\nLast but not least is the renewed interest in Bitcoin development. For most of Bitcoin's history, its lack of functionality led to it being used primarily as a store of value or for speculation. But thanks to recent advancements, such as the development of Layer-2 solutions, Bitcoin can now be utilized in other ways -- to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), engage with DeFi platforms, or as a reliable payment solution.\n\nA historically low supply combined with next year's halving leads me to believe $100,000 Bitcoin is in the cards for 2024. But that might only be scratching the surface of what's possible. As Bitcoin continues to push through traditional barriers and expand into the decentralized economy, its long-term value proposition only grows stronger. While I usually prefer to be conservative in my projections, a price of $100,000 per Bitcoin next year seems like a safe bet. But given Bitcoin's disruptive force, who knows what incredible potential lies beyond 2024?"

        "title": "What Is Cloud Mining of Cryptocurrency, and How Does It Work? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Cloud Mining?\n\nCloud mining is a mechanism to mine a cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, using rented cloud computing power without installing and directly running the hardware and related software. Cloud mining firms allow people to open an account and remotely participate in the process of cryptocurrency mining for a fee. This helps make mining accessible to a broader base of people because it reduces the need to purchase and maintain equipment or pay direct energy costs.\n\nCloud miners become participants in a mining pool, where users purchase a certain amount of \"hash power.\" Each participant earns a pro-rata share of the profits in proportion to the amount of hashing power rented.\n\nKey Takeaways Cloud mining involves mining for cryptocurrencies by leasing or purchasing mining equipment from a third-party mining provider responsible for maintaining the equipment.\n\nThe advantages of cloud mining are that it reduces the costs associated with mining and allows everyday investors who may lack the technical knowledge to mine cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe disadvantages of cloud mining are that the practice centralizes mining, and profits are reduced because they are shared.\n\nUnderstanding Cloud Mining\n\nCloud mining leverages cloud computing to produce blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Cloud computing, more generally, is one of the fastest-growing technology trends wherein computing services such as processing, server capacity, database services, software, and file storage are accessed via the cloud. Such companies charge on a usage basis, just like paying for water or electricity.\n\nMining is the backbone of some cryptocurrency blockchains, like Bitcoin. It is the process by which transactions are verified and added. It is also the means through which new coins are released. The combination of cloud mining and blockchain opens the world of crypto mining to people in distant locations with little or no technical knowledge or hardware infrastructure.\n\nAdvantages of Cloud Mining\n\nCloud mining relieves you of the financial burden of buying expensive equipment and maintaining it. You get to pass those costs on to the owner.\n\nEquipment owners and cloud mining hosts incur considerable upfront costs, so they use economies of scale to offset the expenses. Leasing equipment or hashrate gives them multiple sources of income. Calculated correctly, a cloud mining provider could break even and begin profiting in considerably less time than mining on their own.\n\nBy renting hash power from a mining farm, you get a share of the farm's overall profits without the costs.\n\nDisadvantages of Cloud Mining\n\nOne of the downfalls of cryptocurrency is that because some command such a high price, scams have become a common occurrence.\n\nThere is the prospect of diminishing profits because of increasing mining difficulty and more miners entering the networks to compete for earnings. Mining farms, where cloud mining usually takes place, have a dominant grip on cryptocurrency hashing power.\n\nThis dominance promotes the centralization of cryptocurrencies, which were intended to be decentralized financial systems.\n\nHow Cryptocurrency Cloud Mining Works\n\nMining for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, whether via the cloud or locally, does not actually involve any mining. While this process does generate new cryptocurrency tokens that are awarded to miners, the mining operation serves a much more crucial purpose for maintaining the security of a distributed ledger such as a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin mining is performed by high-powered computers that generate random numbers until a certain value is met. Once the value is guessed, the information contained in the block is validated by the network, a new block is opened, and the process starts all over. It is energy intensive because random numbers are generated over and over. For instance, on Dec. 23, 2023, the Bitcoin network generated more than 500 exahashes (500 quintillion guesses) per second, taking a little less than 10 minutes to open a new block.\n\nContrary to popular belief, mining does not solve \"complex computational math problems.\" Math is used in cryptographic hashing algorithms, such as SHA 256, but processors complete this within less than one second. Mining is a race\u2014whichever miner first guesses a value equal to or less than a number (the target) between zero and 2256 other combinations of letters and numbers wins. The lower the target, the more guesses that are needed.\n\nWhen cryptocurrency miners add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, part of their job is to verify that those transactions are accurate. This is accomplished by checking the hash of the closed block and ensuring it meets other criteria. If even one character in the information of a block was changed, the hash is different. The block is rejected if there is a difference.\n\nOne of the issues present in early blockchains was the ability to duplicate blocks, which allowed the same information to be used twice. This is something called \u201cdouble spending,\u201d which is using the same token for more than one transaction. Sending block information through a hashing function and requiring a majority of the network to agree that the resulting hash is valid prevents this from happening.\n\nDoes Cloud Mining Really Pay? Cloud mining can be profitable, depending on who provides your services. But, as with other types of mining, it is competitive, so there is no guarantee of payment or any continuity between payments.\n\nCan I Cloud Mine for Free? There are several free cloud mining service providers. However, as with everything that is \"free,\" you should use caution and do your own research\u2014don't rely on third parties to tell you about service providers. Many reviews are paid for by businesses and written by outsourced writers.\n\nWhich Cloud Mining Is Best? There are several cloud mining services available, and numerous reviews have been written. However, the best cloud mining service is the one that meets your financial circumstances, goals, and criteria for trustworthiness.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCloud mining is a service provided by businesses which own enough equipment and computational power to make mining more cost effective for people who don't have the means or knowledge to acquire and maintain mining equipment.\n\nFinding the right cloud mining service can be challenging because there are many legitimate ones, but scams are also very frequent in the cryptocurrency industry.

        "content": "The sense of doom that gripped crypto markets at the end of 2022 following a $1.5 trillion wipeout has 12 months later given way to a very different sentiment: avarice.\n\nBitcoin stormed back with a more than 160% advance this year that added some $530 billion to its market capitalization. In its wake, myriad smaller tokens ranging from Sam Bankman-Fried-backed Solana to dog- and frog-themed memecoins took off as investors embraced risk again. An investor who bought $100,000 of Solana at the start of 2023 would now be sitting on a more than $800,000 gain.\n\nUnderpinning much of the bonanza is optimism that US regulators will soon give their first blessing for an exchange-traded fund that invests directly in Bitcoin. Investors will find out by Jan. 10 if that bet, which crypto bulls consider a near-certain winner, pans out.\n\n\u201cThe approval of the spot ETFs is going to be a major catalyst, it\u2019s going to definitely drive a demand shock\" as mainstream investors currently lack a \u201chigh bandwidth, compliant\" investment channel for the token, Michael Saylor, co-founder of Bitcoin holder MicroStrategy Inc., said on Bloomberg Television.\n\nDigital-asset markets still have plenty of detractors who argue cryptocurrencies are fundamentally worthless and a haven for criminals. Binance, the largest exchange, in November agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine for a range of violations and Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao was forced to step down. Bankman-Fried has been jailed for fraud at FTX, and liquidity has yet to fully recover from the collapse of his empire.\n\nHere are a selection of charts showing how crypto fared in 2023.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally this year topped stocks and gold. Supporters say a quadrennial event due in 2024 known as the halving \u2014 or halvening \u2014 will curb supply growth, providing a prop for the token alongside potential ETF demand. The dominant cryptocurrency is still trading well below its November 2021 record of almost $69,000.\n\nBitcoin miners Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc., top US crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. and software-company-turned-Bitcoin-investor MicroStrategy all jumped as crypto markets recovered. Coinbase\u2019s almost 400% gain weathered a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly running an unregistered platform, an accusation the company contests.\n\nBitcoin derivatives saw a burst of activity in 2023. Bitcoin options open interest on Deribit \u2014 the largest crypto options exchange \u2014 exceeded $16 billion for the first time in December, according to CCData. Bitcoin futures open interest also hit landmark levels at CME Group, which is now vying with Binance to be the top marketplace for such instruments.\n\nThe decentralized finance sector has yet to recover from the more than $40 billion collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin project in 2022. One exception is liquid staking, where the total value of locked assets rose to a record this year, data from DefiLlama show. Liquid staking protocols offer easier access to the rewards earned when tokens are pledged to help operate blockchains. Staking grew in popularity on Ethereum after the network\u2019s Shanghai update in April.\n\nWeekly trading volumes for nonfungible tokens \u2014 digital collectibles \u2014 have climbed off lows of less than $50 million in October, reaching about $180 million this month, according to figures from Nansen. But they are a fraction of the $1.8 billion peak seen in 2022, suggesting crypto generally has much work to do to reignite the level of interest the sector attracted during the pandemic, when the world was awash with stimulus.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price has jumped, the crypto market still shows scars from the collapse of Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX platform and his trading house Alameda Research in November 2022. The wipeout contributed to a drop in liquidity, making the token harder to trade.\n\nMarket depth, or the crypto market\u2019s ability to shoulder relatively large orders without unduly impacting prices, illustrates the problem. The daily value of trades falling within 1% of the mid-price of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has dropped 55% to about $680 million from as much as $1.5 billion in April last year, Kaiko data shows.\n\nThere have been big shifts in the market share of crypto exchanges this year. Binance remains the largest venue but its share of spot trading fell to about 44% by mid-December from over 65% at the start of 2023, according to Kaiko. Asia-focused platforms like Upbit, Bybit and OKX picked up much of the business Binance lost.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "content": "Using fundamental data, the analyst noted that the 2024 halving might not be as impactful as the last ones.\n\nThe NVT Signal showed that BTC remains undervalued.\n\nThe effect of the Bitcoin [BTC] halving on the coin\u2019s price might be minimal, seasoned trader Peter Brandt noted in a recent post on X.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s opinion may have put a nail in the heart of BTC holders. But Brandt backed up his point with reasons. According to him, the Bitcoin halving might come with a lot of hype as expected.\n\nHe, however, mentioned that the reduction of supply would ensure that the impact on the BTC price is minimal. Brandt\u2019s opinion came as a surprise to some of his followers who questioned why he moved from his more familiar technical analysis to the fundamental side.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving hype is a whole lot of excitement over nothing\n\nSure, halving hype might temporarily impact price\n\nBut the reduction of supply as % of daily volume is the size of a gnat's ass pic.twitter.com/9JWRr12dkt \u2014 Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 21, 2023\n\nA possible change in the effect\n\nThe analyst responded by saying that technical analysis does not stop him from evaluating demand and supply.\n\nFor many, Brandt\u2019s conclusion may not be valid. One reason for this is the historical BTC performance post-halving. For instance, after the November 2012 halving, Bitcoin went from $11 to $133 in 2013.\n\nThe 2016 having was not any different as BTC rose from $600 to over $4,000 months later. It was also in 2021 that the coin tapped an All-Time High (ATH) above $69,000.\n\nThis time, there is also widespread anticipation that the king coin would reach a new ATH after the 2024 halving.\n\nIn the last 365 days, BTC\u2019s value has increased by 159.22%, making up for the unfavorable market condition experienced in 2022.\n\nConsidering the current circumstances, AMBCrypto checked if the coin has the potential to increase even more. To do this, we considered the Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Signal, provided by on-chain intelligence firm Glassnode.\n\nBTC is not at its top\n\nAt press time, the NVT signal had dropped to 85.40. The metric uses a 90-day moving average of the Bitcoin volume and transaction to identify market tops or bottoms.\n\nSince the NVT Signal fell from 102.33, it means BTC was not overheated.\n\nTherefore, it could be possible for the coin price to increase before 2023 ends. In the interim, many predictions are putting BTC in the $45,000 to $50,000 region before the year closes.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin halving is not the only catalyst capable of impacting the BTC price action next year. There is also the potential spot ETF approval.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nIf the U.S. SEC approves one of the many ETF applications by January 2024, many believe that it would open the door for a flow of institutional capital into Bitcoin.\n\nThis could also influence a surge in the BTC price. So, irrespective of the halving influence, there is a chance for BTC to hit a new high before the four-year event. Whether Brandt\u2019s opinion would come to pass or not, time would tell."

        "content": "The bulls seem to be back in control following the return of the Bitcoin price to above $43,000 this past week. This positive run comes on the back of a period where the premier cryptocurrency struggled, falling below $41,000 at some point.\n\nHowever, the market leader appears to have regained most of its lost momentum, with new heights now in sight. A popular crypto pundit on the X platform has put forward a new prognosis and set a new target for the Bitcoin price.\n\nBTC Price To $47,000? Here\u2019s What Needs To Happen\n\nIn a post on X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez offered insight into the price action of Bitcoin, explaining the potential movements of the cryptocurrency over the coming weeks. This evaluation is based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) data by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nA chart showing the UTXO Realized Price Distribution of Bitcoin | Source: Ali_charts/X\n\nMartinez identified the $43,200 area as a crucial support level, which can potentially determine the fate of Bitcoin\u2019s price. The premier cryptocurrency broke above this price zone on Wednesday, December 20, and has been trading mostly sideways since.\n\nIn his post, Martinez highlighted that so long as the vital $43,200 support holds, the momentum is with the Bitcoin bulls. According to the crypto analyst, staying above this support is one catalyst that could push the Bitcoin price to above $47,360.\n\nOn the flip side of his analysis, he noted that the Bitcoin price could possibly undergo a correction. The crypto pundit emphasized that one of the bearish signals to watch out for is a sustained close below the crucial $43,200 mark.\n\nAccording to Martinez\u2019s projection, a close below $43,200 could send the price of BTC down towards $37,000. This would mean a decline of over 15% from the current price point.\n\nBitcoin Price Overview\n\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $43,783, reflecting a mere 0.5% gain in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, though, the premier cryptocurrency has shown tremendous recovery to return back to its heights of early January.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, the value of BTC is up by more than 4.5% in the past seven days. Meanwhile, the coin\u2019s price has surged by nearly 16% in December as the market leader looks to close out the year on a high.\n\nBitcoin continues to maintain its position as the largest cryptocurrency in the sector, with a market cap of roughly $858 billion.\n\nBTC price experiences correction at $44,000 on the daily timeframe | Source: BTCUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "After tumbling 65% in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC -5.98%) has been a monumental winner this year. The world's leading digital asset has skyrocketed about 160% in 2023, a gain that beats the stock market's gains by a huge margin.\n\nAs of this writing, this top cryptocurrency's price sits at about $43,700. However, I believe there's a very real possibility that it reaches the coveted $100,000 mark by the end of 2024.\n\nContinue reading to see why Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high.\n\nReady for take-off\n\nAs if Bitcoin's returns in 2023 weren't enough, there are multiple catalysts on the horizon that could propel it even higher.\n\nFor starters, there has been a lot of chatter about a potential spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to bring these products to market. Many industry observers think these will be approved as early as January.\n\nBitcoin is set to benefit. Not only would spot ETFs provide a stamp of approval for this digital asset, essentially legitimizing it in the financial services industry, but also, lots of fresh capital could be directed toward Bitcoin. Higher demand could lift the price.\n\nMacro factors could also become more accommodative. With inflation continuing to show signs of cooling, Federal Reserve officials might be ready to cut rates several times in 2024. And this looser monetary policy is generally favorable for riskier assets.\n\nOf course, it's hard to know how much of this optimism is already factored into the price of Bitcoin. But these still are potentially positive developments to pay attention to.\n\nPerhaps the most potent catalyst is next year's halving. Happening approximately every four years, this event cuts in half the new supply of Bitcoin that enters the market. This situation of reduced supply paired with rising demand has usually been extremely bullish for Bitcoin. The next halving is expected in late April.\n\nMaintain the right mindset\n\nBefore going out and loading up on Bitcoin in your portfolio, it's a good idea not to forget that this is still a very volatile asset. For some investors, its up-and-down nature might be too hard to stomach. And for those in or near retirement, owning Bitcoin might be out of the question.\n\nEven for those who are ready to invest, buying only an amount that you are willing to lose is a smart strategy. That's particularly true for people who might not be familiar with Bitcoin. Obviously, as you learn more and gain greater conviction, boosting that allocation can be the right move.\n\nAs with all things investing, don't forget to maintain a long-term time horizon. With Bitcoin, this is doubly important. You should intend to hold for the next decade to watch how things develop. In other words, don't expect to get rich quick.\n\nAnd while I do believe $100,000 is a totally realistic outcome for Bitcoin in 2024, it's not a sure thing. The necessary elements are in place for a monster return, but it's impossible to know what will happen in the next 12 months.\n\nInvestors should definitely still be optimistic about Bitcoin. But the best investors also know that everything doesn't always go according to plan."

        "content": "This time last year, crypto investors wondered if the bleak winter would ever come to an end. FTX, a popular crypto platform, had just collapsed and Bitcoin (BTC) had erased most of the gains of the previous few years. Some wondered if the emerging crypto market could ever recover.\n\nToday tells a different story. The granddaddy of crypto has soared over 160% since the start of the year. According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin opened at around $16,540 on Jan. 1, and at time of writing it was worth almost $44,000.\n\nIs the crypto winter over?\n\nThere's a sense of cautious optimism about Bitcoin and crypto right now. It has crept upwards in spite of economic uncertainty and heavy regulatory headwinds. Bitcoin's price hasn't reached the highs we saw in November 2021, but it has demonstrated a certain resilience. The crypto fear and greed index, which measures market sentiment, has been in greed territory for over a month now.\n\nOne of the big driving factors behind Bitcoin's recent rally is the hope that the SEC might approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2024. Up to now, the SEC has steadfastly refused to greenlight spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, many observers think next year will bring a change of heart.\n\nEarlier this year, an appeals court ruled that the SEC didn't have grounds to say no to the EFT proposals. The SEC didn't appeal the judgment, which fueled speculation that it may now give the go-ahead to one (or several) of the applications in the pipeline.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF could significantly change the crypto landscape. Investors would no longer need to buy Bitcoin from a crypto exchange. Instead, they could use their brokerage account to buy shares in an ETF that owns Bitcoin. It would make it much easier for both retail and institutional inventors to hold the leading crypto.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others.

The soaring prices created a sense that the market could only go upward. Speculation was rife. Sadly, many retail investors lost money in the subsequent crash, which saw Bitcoin lose around half its value in six months.\n\nIf you're wondering whether it will be safe to buy Bitcoin in 2024, the short answer is that cryptocurrency is a risky asset class. It is still a relatively new and unregulated industry, and there is a lot we don't know about how it will unfold. Here are some questions to consider:\n\nAre you comfortable with the volatility? Bitcoin's price fluctuates dramatically. It gained over 300% in 2020, gained another 60% in 2021, only to lose 65% in 2022. It isn't uncommon for Bitcoin's price to move by 20% in a matter of days, which can be difficult for some investors to stomach.\n\nBitcoin's price fluctuates dramatically.

Short-term speculation rarely pays off, so try to understand Bitcoin's long-term potential use cases. Some people argue that Bitcoin could become the native currency of the internet. Others think it could take a portion of the global remittance market or become a currency for emerging markets.

Critics believe it has no inherent value at all. Are you comfortable with crypto's regulatory situation? Most cryptocurrencies are currently viewed as commodities and come under the purview of the CFTC. The SEC has brought charges against several top crypto exchanges this year, making the case that many cryptos are actually unregistered securities. At the same time, at some point the government is likely to introduce a regulatory framework for crypto. But right now there's a lot of noise and not a lot of certainty, which some investors find concerning.\n\nSpeaking personally, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to make up a small percentage of my wider investments. However, I am concerned by the regulatory landscape and the questions about what goes on (or has gone on) behind the scenes at various crypto platforms. Bitcoin's price may have recovered from the collapse of FTX, but for me, the stain of the fraud and extreme mismanagement remains.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nBitcoin's 150% rally in 2023 is great news for crypto investors. But don't assume that the end of the crypto winter means it is safe to enter the crypto waters. Bitcoin still has many significant hurdles to cross. These include a changing regulatory landscape, bruised investor confidence, and questions about its utility. Do your research before you jump in."
