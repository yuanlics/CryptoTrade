        "content": "By increasing the demand on the grid, crypto miners increase the need for demand-response, the cost of such programs, and the cost of providing electricity to all other customers: ERCOT\u2019s independent market monitor expects that Texans could be paying an extra $1.5 billion for electricity in 2023 \u2013 in part to pay cryptocurrency miners to shut down their operations during high demand.\n\nIn Texas, crypto miners can participate in ERCOT\u2019s demand-response program (Responsive Reserve Service) and be paid by the grid operator for agreeing to shut down operations to prevent blackouts. The program pays crypto operations even if they are not actually asked or required to shut down. Many facilities may only shut down for only a few hours a year but can make millions of dollars. Demand-response company Voltus estimates that a cryptocurrency mining company can generate up to 10% of its annual revenue by providing shutdown services to the grid."

        "content": "Global investment firm Franklin Templeton filed for a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, joining BlackRock, Fidelity and others in seeking to start the first bitcoin ETF.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS Franklin Templeton, a $1.45 trillion asset manager, has filed for a bitcoin ETF with the SEC for the first time.\n\nCoinbase has been chosen to act as the custodian for the bitcoin held by the fund; however, a reference rate from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will be used for pricing.\n\nThe move from Franklin Templeton follows similar applications from other financial titans, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, as the crypto market eagerly awaits the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe spot bitcoin ETF filing from Franklin Templeton has terms similar to those seen in recent applications from other major players in traditional finance. According to the filing, Coinbase (COIN) will act as the custodian of the bitcoin held by the fund. Additionally, the ETF is to be traded on Cboe BZX Exchange and will use the CME's CF Bitcoin Reference Rate\u2013New York Variant for pricing.\n\nNotably, this is the first attempt by Franklin Templeton, which has roughly $1.45 trillion worth of assets under management, to create a bitcoin ETF product. This is also notable as Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson has said in the past that \"bitcoin is the greatest distraction from the greatest disruption in financial services, which is blockchain.\"\n\nWill Spot Bitcoin ETFs See The Light Of Day?\n\nThe Franklin Templeton filing follows a wave of new spot bitcoin ETF filings that was kicked off by BlackRock (BLK) in June. Excitement has been building around the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF since then due to BlackRock's reputation and pivotal role in the U.S. financial system. In addition to BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck have also submitted their own, similar applications. Decisions on these spot bitcoin ETFs and others have been delayed by the SEC until October.\n\nRecently, digital asset firm Grayscale scored a victory in their appeal over the SEC's decision to not allow the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTCUSD) to be turned into a full-fledged ETF. While the SEC must now clarify their reasons for rejecting the transition of GBTC to an ETF, the court ruling does not necessarily mean the change or other ETFs will now be approved.\n\n\"We're still reviewing that decision,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said of the Grayscale ruling at a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee hearing this morning.\n\n\"We have multiple filings around bitcoin exchange-traded products,\" Gensler said, \"we're reviewing them and I'm looking forward to staff's recommendations.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin is now rising after dropping below $25,000 on Monday, with many investors gearing up for the FTX estate to sell billions of dollars in crypto assets back into the market.\n\nThe most popular cryptocurrency, after falling to $24,900, rebounded and was up nearly 1.6%, to about $26,100, on Tuesday morning. The second-most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, was up less than 1% to about $1,600.\n\nBehind the decline was investor anxiety over potential actions from the FTX bankruptcy estate, which is responsible for more than $3.4 billion in crypto. The estate is keen to unload it to recover as much as possible for the firm\u2019s creditors. Last month, under its new CEO, the bankruptcy expert John J. Ray III, the company asked permission of the court overseeing its case to hire Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital Capital Management to help it start selling, staking, and hedging crypto assets.\n\nUnder the plan FTX submitted to its bankruptcy court, the company would be allowed to sell up to $100 million in tokens per week, a figure that could increase to $200 million for specific tokens. The plan must still be approved by the bankruptcy court.\n\nThe company owned an estimated $268 million in Bitcoin as of January, according to Decrypt, and offloading too quickly could depress prices. Likely, though, more pain would be inflicted on smaller cryptocurrencies like Solana and Polygon, of which it owns an estimated $685 million and $39 million, respectively, that could potentially be unloaded."

        "content": "Bitcoin only exchange Bull Bitcoin, has announced that it has expanded its services to enable Costa Ricans and foreigners to buy and sell Bitcoin using SINPE Movil, the country's primary fiat payment system, in partnership with circular BTC economy project Bitcoin Jungle, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This collaboration not only opens up new opportunities for those looking to utilize Bitcoin in the country but also simplifies the process of converting Costa Rican colones to BTC and vice versa.\n\nBull Bitcoin is now the first and only Bitcoin exchange in Costa Rica to facilitate seamless transactions using SINPE Movil, the payment network widely embraced by over an estimated 90% of Costa Rican consumers. This development represents a significant milestone, as it grants nearly every Costa Rican access to a secure, low-cost, instant on-ramp and off-ramp for Bitcoin.\n\nFor the first time, residents and visitors alike can effortlessly convert colones to Bitcoin and Bitcoin to colones without the hassle of complex international bank transfers and expensive currency conversion fees. Additionally, Bull Bitcoin allows for conversions to and from bank accounts (IBAN) in both CRC and USD via regular bank transfers, further enhancing the flexibility of Bitcoin usage.\n\nBitcoin Jungle, an open-source community project tailored for Costa Rica, has been instrumental in onboarding hundreds of local merchants, including independent vendors at farmers' markets, into the Bitcoin ecosystem over the past three years. In some regions, like Bahia Ballena, Bitcoin Jungle has effectively established a circular Bitcoin economy.\n\nHowever, one major challenge faced by Bitcoin Jungle was the inability to \"cash out\" Bitcoin for local currency, which hindered broader adoption among merchants. Bull Bitcoin's integration into the Bitcoin Jungle wallet solves this issue by enabling merchants to easily convert their Bitcoin holdings to fiat currency, bolstering their confidence in accepting Bitcoin payments.\n\nTo take advantage of this service, users must download the Bitcoin Jungle wallet and register a username. Within the wallet's settings, they can select the SINPE Movil option to access the buy and sell Bitcoin interface. Purchasing Bitcoin requires a SINPE Movil account, available to Costa Rican citizens and residents, and entails sending funds to Bull Bitcoin's phone number, after which Bitcoin is automatically credited to their Bitcoin Jungle wallet.\n\nThis partnership between Bull Bitcoin and Bitcoin Jungle not only simplifies financial transactions in Costa Rica but also helps to position the country as an internationally recognized Bitcoin hub. By offering locals, tourists, and expats a convenient Bitcoin standard for everyday transactions, Bull Bitcoin and Bitcoin Jungle are driving the adoption of BTC in this vibrant Central American nation.\n\nBull Bitcoin\u2019s entry in the Costa Rica Bitcoin market officially starts its long-awaited international expansion. Over the next 12 months, the exchange will become available to over a billion people worldwide, according to the release. After almost 10 years of being available only in Canada and serving a market of 35 million individuals, Bull Bitcoin says they're ready to offer its internationally-acclaimed services to users across the world.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Franklin Templeton has become the latest traditional finance giant to join the spot bitcoin ETF race.\n\nThe firm, which manages nearly $1.5 trillion in assets, revealed in a Tuesday filing that it intends to list such a fund on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nThe Franklin Bitcoin ETF would be a \u201cseries\u201d within the Franklin Templeton Digital Holdings Trust, the document notes. It intends to \u201creflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin before payment of the fund\u2019s expenses.\u201d\n\nThe ETF\u2019s shares would be backed by bitcoin held by Coinbase Custody Trust Company, the fund\u2019s custodian.\n\nA spokesperson for Franklin Templeton declined to comment beyond the filing.\n\nThe proposal joins a long list of such applications currently before the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nArk and 21Shares re-filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in April, about two months before asset management titan BlackRock shared plans to launch a similar offering. BlackRock\u2019s entrance into the bitcoin ETF pursuit prompted Fidelity, Invesco, Bitwise and a handful of other issuers to also retry their own attempts.\n\nThough issuers have long sought to bring to the US market an ETF that holds bitcoin directly, the SEC has never permitted one to begin trading.\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s filing comes a couple weeks after Grayscale Investments won a case against the SEC in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judges in that case said the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s conversion of its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF \u2014 while allowing bitcoin futures ETFs to come to market \u2014 was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d Though the decision does not force the SEC to approve the GBTC conversion, the judges told the agency it can\u2019t deny the conversion with the reasons it previously used.\n\nRead more: What Grayscale\u2019s win against the SEC actually means\n\nSome industry watchers told Blockworks they believed the ruling positively impacted the chances that the SEC would approve a spot bitcoin ETF at some point \u2014 perhaps by as early as the end of the year.\n\nThe decision prompted Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, for example, to up the likelihood of bitcoin ETF approval from 65% to 75% by the end of 2023. The analysts wrote in an August research note they believe there is a 95% chance such a product launches in the US by the end of 2024.\n\nFranklin Templeton is not exactly a stranger to the crypto space.\n\nRoger Bayston, the firm\u2019s head of digital assets, told Blockworks in June that blockchain technology is set to be \u201ctransformational\u201d for capital markets. The firm has a mutual fund that utilizes the Stellar and Polygon blockchains.\n\nUpdated Sept. 12, 2023 at 10:12 am ET: Added context about Roger Bayston.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

XRP dropped 5%, according to Coin Metrics, along with the Polygon token. Polkadot 's coin lost 4%, while Binance Coin , Solana's sol token and litecoin were down by about 3% each.\n\n\"It feels like fatigue, and with general pullback in liquidity from market makers any move lower tends to be more volatile,\" said Darius Tabatabai, co-founder of Vertex Protocol. \"That said, the environment is challenging with volumes still low overall and users not returning to crypto in droves as of yet.\""

        "content": "Use our interactive map to see where your country ranks on the 2023 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index.\n\nThis post is an excerpt from our 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report. Download your copy now!\n\nWe\u2019re excited to unveil the fourth annual Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index. The goal of the index is simple: We combine on-chain data and real-world data to measure which countries are leading the world in grassroots crypto adoption. Grassroots crypto adoption isn\u2019t about which countries have the highest raw transaction volumes \u2014 anyone could probably guess that the biggest, wealthiest countries are far ahead there. Instead, we want to highlight the countries where average, everyday people are embracing crypto the most. To do that, we\u2019ve designed the Global Crypto Adoption Index to identify countries where the most people are putting the greatest share of their wealth into cryptocurrency. We\u2019ll explain the full methodology below, then provide the top 20 countries on our index, along with a few key takeaways.\n\nKeep reading, and we\u2019ll discuss:\n\nOur Global Crypto Adoption Index methodology\n\nThe Global Crypto Adoption Index is made up of five sub-indexes. Each of those sub-indexes is based on countries\u2019 usage of different types of cryptocurrency services. We rank all 154 countries for which we have sufficient data on each sub-index, weight the rankings by characteristics like population size and purchasing power, take the geometric mean of each country\u2019s ranking in all five, and then normalize that final number on a scale of 0 to 1 to give every country a score that determines the overall rankings. The closer the country\u2019s final score is to 1, the higher the rank.\n\nIn order to calculate our sub-indexes, we estimate countries\u2019 transaction volumes for different types of cryptocurrency services and protocols based on the web traffic patterns of those services\u2019 and protocols\u2019 websites. We acknowledge that web traffic data isn\u2019t perfect. Some crypto users are almost certainly employing VPNs and other tools that mask online activity. But given that our index takes into account hundreds of millions of transactions and 13 billion web visits, we\u2019re confident that any misattributed transaction volume due to VPNs is too small to compromise the data as a whole. We also vet our index with local crypto experts and operators around the world, giving us more confidence in this methodology.\n\nBelow is a description of each sub-index, how it\u2019s calculated, and why we believe it\u2019s valuable for measuring grassroots crypto adoption.\n\nOn-chain cryptocurrency value received at centralized exchanges, weighted by purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita\n\nThe goal of this sub-index is to rank each country by total cryptocurrency activity occurring on centralized crypto exchanges, and weight the rankings to favor countries where that amount is more significant based on the income of the average person in that country. We calculate this by estimating the total cryptocurrency received on-chain by users of centralized services in each country, and weighting that value based on PPP per capita, which is a measure of the country\u2019s income per resident. The higher the ratio of on-chain value received to PPP per capita, the higher the ranking. In other words, if two countries received equal amounts of cryptocurrency at centralized services, the country with lower PPP per capita would rank ahead.\n\nOn-chain retail value received at centralized exchanges, weighted by PPP per capita\n\nThe goal of this metric is to measure the activity of non-professional, individual cryptocurrency users at centralized services, based on how much cryptocurrency they\u2019re transacting compared to the purchasing power of the average person. We do this by measuring the amount of cryptocurrency received at centralized services by users in each country, similar to the above, but only counting value received in retail-sized transactions, which we designate as transactions under $10,000 USD worth of cryptocurrency. We then rank each country according to this metric but weight it to favor countries with a lower PPP per capita.\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, weighted by PPP per capita and number of internet users\n\nP2P trade volume makes up a significant percentage of all cryptocurrency activity in emerging markets. For this sub-index, we rank countries by their P2P trade volume and weight it to favor countries with lower PPP per capita and fewer internet users, the goal being to highlight countries where more residents are putting a larger share of their overall income and wealth into P2P cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nOn-chain cryptocurrency value received from DeFi protocols, weighted by PPP per capita\n\nDeFi (decentralized finance) is the cutting edge of cryptocurrency. Given the sector\u2019s importance to innovation in crypto, we want our adoption index to highlight countries where users are conducting a disproportionately high share of their financial activity using DeFi protocols. For this sub-index, we rank countries by their DeFi transaction volume, and weight the rankings to favor countries with lower PPP per capita.\n\nOn-chain retail value received from DeFi protocols, weighted by PPP per capita\n\nWe want our index to highlight the DeFi activity of non-professional, individual cryptocurrency users, just as we do for centralized services. So, this sub-index ranks each country by DeFi transaction volume carried out in retail-sized transfers, weighted to favor countries with lower PPP per capita.\n\nThe 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20\n\nCountry Region Overall index ranking Centralized service value received ranking Retail centralized service value received ranking P2P exchange trade volume ranking DeFi value received ranking Retail DeFi value received ranking India Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 1 1 1 5 1 1 Nigeria Sub-Saharan Africa 2 3 2 1 4 4 Vietnam Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 3 4 4 2 3 3 United States North America 4 2 8 12 2 2 Ukraine Eastern Europe 5 5 3 11 10 10 Philippines Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 6 6 6 19 7 7 Indonesia Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 7 13 13 14 5 5 Pakistan Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 8 7 7 9 20 20 Brazil Latin America 9 9 11 15 11 11 Thailand Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 10 8 15 44 6 6 China Eastern Asia 11 10 5 13 23 23 Turkey Middle East & North Africa 12 11 9 35 12 12 Russia Eastern Europe 13 12 10 36 9 9 United Kingdom Central, Northern, & Western Europe 14 15 20 38 8 8 Argentina Latin America 15 14 12 29 19 19 Mexico Latin America 16 17 18 30 16 16 Bangladesh Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 17 18 19 33 22 22 Japan Eastern Asia 18 22 21 49 18 18 Canada North America 19 25 23 62 14 14 Morocco Middle East & North Africa 20 27 25 21 26 26\n\nThe first key takeaway here is that the Central & Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO) region dominates the top of the index, with six of the top ten countries located in the region. As we explore in the full report, the circumstances driving adoption in each CSAO country are unique, which leads to different usage trends and breakdowns of most popular services.\n\nGlobal adoption is down, but not in one crucial subset of the world\n\nThere\u2019s no sugarcoating it: Worldwide grassroots crypto adoption is down. We can see this on the chart below, where we apply our Adoption Index methodology globally by summing all 154 countries\u2019 index scores for each quarter from Q3 2020 to the present, and re-index them again to show adoption growth over time across the world.\n\nWhile there\u2019s been a marked recovery since the doldrums of late 2022, around the time FTX imploded, grassroots adoption is still well off its all-time highs.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t true everywhere. More specifically, there\u2019s one crucial segment of countries where grassroots adoption has seen a much stronger recovery than anywhere else: Lower middle income (LMI) countries. LMI is one of four designations used by the World Bank to classify countries by income level, based on gross national income (GNI) per capita. Those categories are as follows:\n\nWorld Bank income classification GNI per capita range Example countries High income (HI) > $13,205 USA, UK, Saudi Arabia Upper middle income (UMI) $4,256 \u2013 $13,205 Argentina, China, Russia Lower middle income (LMI) $1,086 \u2013 $4,255 India, Nigeria, Ukraine Low income (LI) < $1,085 Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen\n\nMany of the top countries on our Global Crypto Adoption Index, from Central & Southern Asia to Africa, are in the LMI category, and taken together, LMI countries have seen the greatest recovery in grassroots crypto adoption over the last year. In fact, LMI is the only category of countries whose total grassroots adoption remains above where it was in Q3 2020, just prior to the most recent bull market.\n\nThis could be extremely promising for crypto\u2019s future prospects. LMI countries are often countries on the rise, with dynamic, growing industries and populations. Many of them have undergone significant economic development in the last few decades to rise from the low income group. And perhaps most importantly of all, 40% of the world\u2019s population live in LMI countries \u2014 more than any other income category. If LMI countries are the future, then the data indicates that crypto is going to be a big part of that future. That, combined with the fact that institutional adoption \u2014 primarily driven by organizations in high-income countries \u2014 continues to gain steam even during the ongoing crypto winter, paints a promising picture of the future. We could see a combination of bottom up and top down cryptocurrency adoption in the near future if these trends hold, as digital assets fulfill the unique needs of individuals in both segments. We\u2019ll explore these trends and more in our full 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

        "content": "The price of bitcoin bounced Tuesday, reversing losses from the previous day that were driven by fears around FTX liquidations.\n\nBitcoin was last higher by 4.5% at $26,185.72, according to Coin Metrics. On Monday, bitcoin dipped below the key $25,000 support level for the first time since March. The rebound could be fueled in part by investors who were betting against the crypto asset scrambling to cover short positions, in other words, by a short squeeze.\n\nInvestors have been selling their crypto in anticipation of a hearing Wednesday in which liquidators could be permitted to start selling the assets of FTX and Alameda Research, its sister company. The tokens native to the Solana and Polygon networks are among some of the company's biggest holdings. On Monday, they fell 3% and 5%, respectively. On Tuesday, they were last higher by about 2.5% each.\n\nThere's still room for disappointment, however. Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton said weakened momentum in the intermediate term could make it difficult for bitcoin to see a durable recovery. With Tuesday's bounce, the cryptocurrency's next level to test on the upside is $27,600 \u2014 its 50-day moving average.\n\nFTX liquidations aside, the crypto market has recently struggled for meaningful catalysts as investors wait for clearer regulation and attention has shifted back to inflation and economic inputs after a string of stronger-than-expected data points last week renewed concern that the Federal Reserve could raise rates once more before year-end.\n\nThis week, investors get the August consumer price index and producer price index readings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively."

        "content": "Bitcoin was trading below US$26,000 on Monday afternoon in Asia, while Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses. The market is also under pressure after news that the collapsed FTX crypto exchange may soon liquidate its US$3.4 billion in crypto holdings. Asian equities traded mixed. U.S. futures gained ahead of crucial inflation data release while European bourses gained ahead of the central bank policy meeting later this week.\n\nSee related article: FTX sues LayerZero Labs to recover US$21 million\n\nAll top 10 cryptos drop\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.15% to US$25,811 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 0.56%, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cCurrently, Bitcoin\u2019s price is trading without a clear direction amidst cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin, which leads the entire crypto market, will be influenced by various technical factors in the absence of news and legal decisions related to the cryptocurrency market in the coming week,\u201d Rania Gule, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage firm XS.com told Forkast.\n\n\u201cI believe that the crucial support level of US$24,995 will determine whether Bitcoin\u2019s price goes up or down. A clear and strong break below this level would send Bitcoin toward the very important support level at US$24,000, which would indicate a clear bearish trend reversal. In the worst-case scenario, the selling momentum in this case could push the price down to around US$21,915, which is roughly the mid-March level,\u201d Gule said.\n\nEther, the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token, fell 0.78% to US$1,611 in the last 24 hours, and dropped 1.63% in the last seven days.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked on Sunday, resulting in losses for some of Buterin\u2019s followers, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. Hackers posted links to a scam non-fungible token (NFT) project on Buterin\u2019s Twitter page, advising users to connect their crypto wallets before withdrawing the funds.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cEthereum price indicators continue to show signals of the ongoing bearish trend, supported by a breach of the trendline that took the price below the critical support level of US$1,687. This paves the way for a potential 27% drop in ETH price. I believe the price could reach a significant level of US$1,200, with intermediate support at US$1,366,\u201d Gule of XS.com pointed out.\n\nThe crypto market is also facing downward pressure from the latest FTX news. The collapsed cryptocurrency exchange is likely to receive approval on Sept. 13 to start liquidating its crypto holdings, according to a tweet from blockchain analysts Whale Alert. After filing for bankruptcy in November last year, the exchange still holds an estimated US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets.\n\nJohn Stefanidis, chief executive of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO, said, \u201cThe recent dip in value of altcoins could be attributed to the anticipated authorisation of the liquidation of assets held by FTX. With a portfolio encompassing billions in cryptocurrency assets, a potential liquidation could significantly influence market values, notably affecting Solana, Aptos, Dogecoin, Matic, TON, and XRP.\u201d\n\nToncoin was the biggest loser, declining 3.38% to US$1.70 in the past 24 hours, and losing 9.96% in the past seven days.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP was the second biggest loser, dropping 2.91% to US$0.4857 on the day and 3.54% on the week. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) submitted a filing last Friday to push the court of the Southern District of New York to appeal its ruling on the agency\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The SEC requested the court to review its prior ruling by Judge Analisa Torres that posed \u201cknotty legal problems,\u201d according to the filing. In July, a summary judgment by Judge Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, but sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not.\n\nRipple Labs also announced that it will acquire Nevada-based crypto infrastructure startup Fortress Trust, giving Ripple a regulatory license in the state of Nevada.\n\nElsewhere, the Group of 20 (G20) meeting under India\u2019s presidency, said during the weekend that member countries will work together to develop a coordinated global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, cross-border cooperation and information sharing.\n\n\u201cCrypto assets and how regulation can be put in place \u2013 we contributed to a roadmap so [that] over the next month progress can be made in that area,\u201d Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of International Monetary Fund said at the conclusion of G20 leaders summit in India\u2019s capital New Delhi on Sunday.\n\nCongratulations to India on a successful #G20 presidency. Its theme of \"one earth, one family, one future\" resonated with global leaders, who reached an important consensus on ways to address the global challenges confronting us. My takeaways from \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3's successful @g20org summit. \u2014 Kristalina Georgieva (@KGeorgieva) September 10, 2023\n\nHowever, one of the key challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry globally is the delay in implementing these recommendations at a national level, according to Caroline Bowler, chief executive of Australian digital asset exchange BTC Markets.\n\n\u201cWhile international organizations are setting the framework for a harmonized regulatory environment, it is imperative that governments and regulatory authorities act promptly to translate these guidelines into actionable regulations. Delayed implementation could hinder the industry\u2019s growth, create uncertainty, and potentially leave investors and consumers exposed to risks,\u201d Bowler said in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization dropped 0.54% to US$1.03 trillion, while market volume gained 36.82% to US$20.63 billion.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume, transactions drop\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.85% to 2,119 in 24 hours to 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, dropping 3.53% on the week, with Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon indexes also declining.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume dropped 4.08% to US$8,757,370 in the past 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data. NFT transactions dropped over 10% at the same time.\n\n\u201cAs we head into the slowest months of the year one has to wonder how low we can really go, and if we can fall to Feb. 2021 levels where we saw US$35-50 million in sales,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nAmong blockchains, Ethereum topped the rankings by sales volume, which rose 2.67% to US$4.7 million. Mythos and Polygon networks ranked second and third respectively.\n\nAmong collections, Mythos-based DMarket topped rankings although its sales volume fell 7.76% to US$1,012,238 in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cFootball NFTs were hot with the kickoff of the NFL season. Both DraftKings with their fantasy football NFTs and NFL All Day with their pure collectibles saw millions in sales over the past seven days,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nSales of Polygon-based DraftKings gained 45.96% to US$579,756, ranking it the third biggest collection by sales volume.\n\nAsian equities mixed; U.S. futures, European bourses gain\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden in Vietnam on Sept. 11. Investors are looking forward to latest U.S. inflation data due for release later this week. Image: President Biden/Twitter\n\nMajor Asian stock markets traded mixed on Monday as investors await the latest U.S. inflation data due for release later this week. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component Index, as well as South Korea\u2019s Kospi gained. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index dropped at the end of trading hours.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.\n\nA recent rise in oil prices and stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. services recorded last week have fueled inflation concerns in the U.S., Reuters reported.\n\nThe CPI prediction of 3.8% is still higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term goal of bringing the annual inflation below 2%. The Fed last raised the interest rate in July to between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest since early 2001.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened as of 8 p.m. in Hong Kong on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the green.\n\nIndia\u2019s benchmark index Sensex rose 0.79% at the close of trading hours on Monday.\n\nEuropean bourses \u2013 the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 \u2013 gained on Monday. Investors are looking forward to the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB\u2019s) policy meeting outcome on Thursday, which is expected to indicate whether the central bank will increase interest rates further. ECB policymakers are divided over raising rates again, amid slowing economic activity and persistent inflation that remains above the 2% target.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot get yourself to hike in September, the case will not be stronger in October as economic data will likely worsen, and inflation in September will come lower quite a bit,\u201d said UBS chief European economist Reinhard Cluse, who expects a 25 basis-point increase, according to a Reuters report.\n\n(updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Scott Purcell, the founder and CEO of Fortress Trust, a custodian that safeguards customers\u2019 crypto, told Fortune that his firm lost $12 million to $15 million in crypto in a recent hack. Most of that was Bitcoin, but small amounts of USDC and USDT, the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization, also were stolen.\n\n\u201cIt was $12 to $15 million out of billions, and we covered it right away,\u201d he told Fortune, in reference to the total amount of stolen crypto compared to the amount Fortress Trust holds in custody for customers. \u201cIt was only really four customers out of 225,000 customers.\u201d\n\nPurcell\u2019s previously unreported admission follows a report from The Block that crypto giant Ripple reimbursed customers affected by the hack as part of its recently announced acquisition of Fortress Trust. The crypto custodian had previously said the security breach resulted in \u201cno loss of funds.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Ripple declined to comment on the extent of the security breach but said that \u201cthe amount used to cover customer funds was baked into the deal.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 7, Fortress disclosed that four \u201cFortress customers were impacted by a third-party vendor whose cloud tools were compromised\u201d and wrote that \u201cimpacted accounts were fully restored.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Ripple announced its acquisition of Fortress, with CEO Brad Garlinghouse saying in a statement that the firm has \u201cbuilt an impressive business with recurring revenue and a strong roster of both crypto-native and new-to-crypto customers.\u201d\n\nAt the time of announcement, neither Ripple nor Fortress Trust disclosed that Ripple had agreed to make customers whole as part of the deal. In The Block\u2018s report on the added wrinkle to the tie-up, a spokesperson for Ripple said that conversations \u201caccelerated last week following the security incident via a third-party analytics vendor, but this opportunity makes sense for Ripple in the long term.\u201d\n\nPurcell, the former CEO of Prime Trust, another crypto custodian that went belly up after it was alleged to be misusing customer funds amid a security breach, declined to identify the four customers affected by the hack or the \u201cthird-party vendor whose cloud tools were compromised.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019d imagine, the first few days were complex and involved (and continue to involve) the F.B.I., Secret Service, regulators and others,\u201d Purcell told Fortune in an email. \u201cWe brought in cybersecurity teams who are very experienced with these things to sweep the system and ensure nothing else was affected.\u201d\n\nPurcell repeatedly emphasized that fault for the security breach was with the third-party vendor, not Fortress Trust, or the company\u2019s custody partners, Fireblocks or BitGo.\n\nA spokesperson for Fireblocks did not confirm the extent of the security breach to Fortune. \u201cWe can confirm that the breach happened on a third-party service with a preconfigured automated authorization and that the Fireblocks platform behaved according to the configuration,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nBitGo CEO Mike Belshe previously posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the incident had \u201cnothing to do with BitGo.\u201d He added: \u201cThe real victims here are Fortress\u2019 clients who deserved enough respect to get the whole truth. They are not to be blamed.\u201d\n\nPurcell, the CEO of Fortress Trust, told Fortune that BitGo had also been in the running to acquire his company: \u201cAs you\u2019ve seen from his sour-grapes tweets, Mike Belshe has chosen to violate our NDA to essentially whine about me not selling the trust company to him.\u201d"

        "content": "A federal judge on Monday heard from multiple women who said they were victimized by a New Hampshire man's unlicensed bitcoin exchange business but postponed a sentencing hearing in the case to evaluate whether restitution is appropriate.\n\nProsecutors said Ian Freeman, a libertarian activist and radio show host, created a business that catered to fraudsters who targeted elderly women with romance scams, serving as \"the final step in permanently separating the victims from their money.\"\n\nAfter a two-week trial, he was convicted of eight charges in December, though his conviction on a money laundering charge was later overturned. He was scheduled to be sentenced on the remaining charges, which include operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering, on Monday but the hearing was delayed until next month.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Joseph LaPlante said the delay was necessary to give Freeman's attorneys a chance to object to the prosecution's push to make restitution part of the sentence. Prosecutors also argue he should get a harsher sentence because victims, many of them elderly, were particularly vulnerable.\n\nGet Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox.

Three members of the Crypto Six speak out about their federal indictment, including Ian Freeman, host of the talk show \u201cFree Talk Live\u201d, Aria DiMezzo, the high priestess of the Reformed Satanic Church of Keene and Nobody, the former Pope Indigent of the Church of the Invisible Hand.\n\nWhile the issue of whether those who sent money to Freeman should be considered victims remains unsettled, two of them read letters in court Monday and a third participated by video remotely.\n\nKaren Miller, of Florida, described herself as a lonely widow who got scammed by a man she met on a dating site. At his instruction, she sent $300,000 to Freeman, wiping out her life's savings. Another woman, Rebecca Viar, told a similar story of taking out three loans and selling her late husband's truck to send money to the man who duped her.\n\nGet updates on what's happening in Boston to your inbox.

        "content": "In the curious annals of cryptocurrency extravagance, a recent Bitcoin aficionado has seemingly cast fiscal responsibility to the wind, quite literally sending their wallet on a high-speed roller coaster to financial oblivion. Behold, dear reader, the tale of an extravagant Bitcoin transaction that could leave even the wealthiest of tycoons blinking in disbelief.\n\nA Massive Fee\n\nThe user in question has just dazzled the digital world by parting ways with a jaw-dropping 19 Bitcoins. This is a staggering sum. An astronomical $509,563 as a mere transaction fee.\n\nThe transaction that paid nearly 20 BTC ($500,000) fee a few hours ago looks like an exchange or payment processor with buggy software.\n\n\n\nThey've received 60,000+ txns and sent 60,000+ txns from the same address (bad practice) and likely calculated their change output incorrectly. pic.twitter.com/s44Yc8S2ia \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) September 10, 2023\n\nThe revelation of this financial fireworks display was down to no other than Whale Alert, that digital Big Brother ceaselessly watching over large-scale crypto transactions. One could almost hear the collective gasps reverberating through the blockchain Blockchain Blockchain comprises a digital network of blocks with a comprehensive ledger of transactions made in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or other altcoins.One of the signature features of blockchain is that it is maintained across more than one computer.

Because a blockchain is stored across a network of computers, it is very difficult to tampe Read this Term as this incredible fee came to light. People are obviously looking over their shoulders and wondering what's happening after Bitcoin's challenging summer.\n\nNow, let's put this into perspective, shall we? The average Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term transaction fee hovers around a mere $1.410. A paltry sum, really, and a far cry from the astronomic anomaly we're dissecting here.\n\nBut, there's more to this story. The astute observer would recognize that average fees can oscillate wildly, much like a volatile roller coaster at a cryptocurrency theme park. For instance, during the cryptocurrency boom of 2017, fees sky-rocketed to nearly $60, causing more than a few sleepless nights among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nNow, let's dig into the cryptic reasons behind this exorbitant transaction fee. Was it an inadvertent slip of the finger, a hapless misconfiguration in the labyrinthine maze of transaction software, or did this user have some clandestine motive known only to themselves and the blockchain gods?\n\nThe cryptocurrency community, ever a cauldron of opinions and witty remarks, reacted with a spectrum of emotions. Some didn\u2019t believe a word of it, while others simply couldn't resist cracking jokes about the future of finance and the eye-watering costs of utilizing Bitcoin. One user wryly pointed out that this fee surpassed the reward for mining three brand-new Bitcoin blocks \u2014 the very incentive for those tireless miners to validate transactions.\n\nThe consensus appears to be that it was an end user mistake or a software mistake. Jameson Lopp, a notable figure in the cryptocurrency community and the Co-Founder of the wallet Casa, highlighted the fact that the account was a withdraw-only hot wallet tied to an enterprise and suggested that it was down to a software error from an exchange or payment processor address.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll all be fine. Chun Wang, the Co-Founder of Bitcoin mining pool F2Pool, claimed that the overpaid fees will be temporarily held. The user responsible has a three-day window to claim these fees. If unclaimed within this period, miners will redistribute these funds, according to Wang. Let\u2019s all breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nBut, perhaps most intriguingly, this extravagant episode has reignited the age-old debate about Bitcoin's scalability and efficiency. It's the perfect fodder for the proponents of alternative cryptocurrencies who now have a fresh canvas upon which to paint their critiques of the crypto kingpin.\n\nWhatever happened, it\u2019s a hell of a tale. Remember. Type slowly. Double check everything. Never rush to hit \u2018enter\u2019."

        "content": "Yet another legacy firm from Wall Street is entering the fray for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, following early applications from BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nFranklin Templeton, a financial heavyweight that dates its founding back to the mid\u201320th century, submitted an application for what it calls the \u201cFranklin Bitcoin ETF\u201d on Tuesday morning, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s application says it would list the Bitcoin ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange, and like BlackRock, lists Coinbase as its Bitcoin custodian.\n\nIn the filing, Franklin Templeton writes that the firm would use the CF Benchmarks Index, a fusion of Bitcoin prices from a slew of separate crypto exchanges, to inform its prices and prevent potential price manipulation.\n\nA spokesperson for the asset management firm declined to comment on the filing.\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s application comes after a unanimous federal appeals court last month found that the SEC had wrongly denied a bid by crypto firm Grayscale to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. In its much-anticipated decision, the court said the denial was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the agency\u2019s prior approvals of ETFs for Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe push to obtain a spot Bitcoin ETF has been described as a \u201choly grail\u201d for the crypto industry as approval is expected to attract potentially trillions of dollars in investment from conservative institutional investors like pension funds.\n\nFor years, firms like Grayscale have tried and failed to persuade the SEC to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, even though the agency approved a number of Bitcoin futures trading products. The SEC repeatedly cited potential market manipulation as one of the key factors for why it repeatedly denied companies\u2019 ETF applications.\n\nTo allay the federal agency\u2019s concerns, BlackRock said it would partner with Nasdaq as a \u201csurveillance partner\u201d to monitor the Bitcoin markets and detect potential manipulation. After BlackRock\u2019s filing, ARK Invest, Fidelity, and others inserted similar agreements into their ETF applications. Franklin Templeton\u2019s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF included no mention of a surveillance partner.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price soared above $31,000 in response to the ETF filings from BlackRock and Fidelity, but has since slumped, never regaining the same momentum that had propelled the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency to its highest price in more than a year.\n\nUpdate, Sept. 12, 2023: Further details on Franklin Templeton\u2019s lack of a surveillance partner in its initial ETF application were included."

        "content": "Citigroup Funds Bitcoin Pollution\n\nCiti has been expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency sector by developing services that enable buying and selling Bitcoin, and providing underwriting for Bitcoin mining and other crypto companies to raise capital. These dirty investments contradict Citi\u2019s net zero pledges and commitments to sustainability.\n\nCitigroup, one of the largest funders of fossil fuels in the world, is investing in yet another fossil fuel lifeline \u2013 Bitcoin.\n\nCiti has been expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency sector by developing services that enable buying and selling Bitcoin, and providing underwriting for Bitcoin mining and other crypto companies to raise capital. These dirty investments contradict Citi\u2019s net zero pledges and commitments to sustainability.\n\nYet, Citi has not publicly acknowledged Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact or addressed how its investments and products are tied to Bitcoin\u2019s emissions. The operation of large traditional financial companies like Citi in the crypto sector brings a new level of trust and accessibility to Bitcoin, in addition to providing much-needed capital. Together, this support can drive up the price of Bitcoin and, in turn, its energy use and GHG emissions. Most of that energy is generated by dirty fossil fuels which drives the climate crisis and creates local air pollution that harms public health.\n\nOne way Citi is connected to Bitcoin is through investment and trading services. In 2021, Citi announced that it would offer bitcoin futures trading for some institutional clients. Citi\u2019s Securities Services team is also partnering with Swiss crypto firm Metaco to build Citi\u2019s digital asset custody capabilities\u2013basically, secure accounts to store digital assets which could eventually include bitcoin. Citi\u2019s Global Wealth Investments arm also formed a Digital Assets Group to expand into crypto. News outlets reported that Citi hired 100 people to work in a blockchain and digital assets division. Yet, there are no signs of that expertise being put to work cleaning-up Bitcoin and creating innovative solutions to move Bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism away from the current polluting Proof-of-Work system.\n\nCiti has also helped Bitcoin and crypto industry companies access capital necessary for expanding their operations. The bank provides vital underwriting services for several major crypto industry companies, which helps these firms issue shares and bonds to raise money. Access to capital markets through reputable investment banks like Citi is vital for the expansion of the Bitcoin industry.\n\nOne example of this dynamic was Citi\u2019s role as joint manager for a 2021 initial public offering (IPO) by Bitcoin miner Iris Energy. That IPO raised $231.54 million, which the company said would help develop its facilities and buy more mining equipment. Citi controlled 22.5% of the shares and earned $3.65 million in fees. (1)\n\nCiti was also the lead manager for Canaan Inc.\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) in 2019. Canaan is a China-based producer of ASICS, the specialized computers used for Bitcoin mining, that is also expanding into the operation of mining facilities including in Kazakhstan where coal energy use is widespread and Bitcoin mining has met backlash and government restrictions. Citi controlled 54.35% of the shares offered and earned an estimated $3.91 million in fees on the IPO that raised $90 million.\n\nIn 2021, Citi was also the sole manager of a $500 million bond private placement for Galaxy Digital Holdings, a crypto investment and finance company that provides financial services for Bitcoin miners and is expanding its own mining operations. (2) Galaxy Digital said it intended to use the capital to fund growth initiatives. Later in 2022, Galaxy helped Bitcoin miner Argo avoid bankruptcy by issuing them a $35 million loan and buying their mining facility in Helios, TX.\n\nCiti has also invested in the largest U.S. crypto exchange, Coinbase, that enables retail and institutional investors to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin. The services provided by exchanges like Coinbase help drive adoption of Bitcoin and its price which ultimately leads to more energy use. In 2021, Citi was a joint lead manager for the private placement of two different $1 billion bonds for Coinbase, a large raise of capital for the nascent crypto industry. Citi also owns nearly $800,000 in a Coinbase bond. (3)\n\nWhile Citi does not have an extensive assessment management division, the company still holds shares in 10 Bitcoin mining companies worth about $125,000 including Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms.\n\nDespite expanding services for the crypto industry, Citi appears to know Bitcoin is bad for the climate. In 2021, Citi analysts published a report documenting Bitcoin\u2019s growing energy use and warned that the carbon emissions would likely meet public and regulatory scrutiny. The report highlighted how Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption would accelerate alongside its price. Yet, Citi\u2019s plans to reach net zero in company financing activities by 2050 and in operations by 2030 as well as reporting on investments in carbon-intensive sectors don\u2019t address Bitcoin related investments and services. Citi is also a founding member of the UN\u2019s Net Zero Banking Alliance and joined the RMI Center for Climate Aligned Finance and the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).\n\nCiti needs to live up to their climate commitments and be a leader in cleaning up Bitcoin and helping create innovative solutions that chart a sustainable path forward for cryptocurrencies.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Data on underwriting and shareholding was collected from the Bloomberg Terminal, Bloomberg Finance L.P.\n\n2 Data from league tables on the Bloomberg Terminal, Bloomberg Finance L.P.\n\n3 Based on data from Bloomberg Terminal, Bloomberg Finance L.P."

The idea was simple yet powerful \u2013 create a digital, decentralized, secure network resistant to a single point of failure. Through the years, Bitcoin has seen some major tests, including (but not limited to):\n\nThe 2008 Financial Crisis\n\nBitcoin went live slightly after the largest recession in more than 100 years.\n\nMt. Gox Collapse\n\nEarly in Bitcoin\u2019s existence, Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world and handled around 70% of Bitcoin transactions. However, in early 2014, Mt. Gox was hacked, and the exchange lost approximately 850,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers, equating to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFTX Bankruptcy\n\nFTX was one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, but in 2022, regulators discovered that its founder Sam Bankman Fried, allegedly mishandled customer funds. Soon after, Fried was arrested, and FTX was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nBitcoin Resilience\n\nBitcoin is known for having ardent haters and religious followers. Nonetheless, despite the shockwaves these and other events sent through the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin itself has survived. Through thick and thin, Bitcoin has continued to function as a decentralized digital currency, and its price eventually recovered. Since its inception, Bitcoin\u2019s average annual return has been stunning \u2013 230% annually (well above the S&P 500 and pretty much every asset). Bitcoin is now worth $510 billion \u2013 well above most Fortune 500 companies.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nInstitutional Adoption: A Major Catalyst that Hasn\u2019t Come to Fruition (Yet)\n\nIf you missed the meteoric Bitcoin returns, is the juice still worth the squeeze? The answer is yes. Bitcoin has achieved stunning returns without major institutional investors being involved. Below are 3 catalysts that will send Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies even higher:\n\nLegal Clarity\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is locked in major lawsuits against crypto players. Recently, XRP altcoin parent Ripple scored a historic court win over the SEC. The court ruled that XRP is not an offer of unregistered securities. That\u2019s potentially good news for Coinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange that is currently entangled in a similar lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nNew Accounting Standards\n\nRecently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changed corporate accounting rules \u2013 a move that will help crypto-centric companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR). MSTR, one of the largest Bitcoin holders, can now alleviate undesired perceptions associated with holding Bitcoin. Furthermore, the new standards will allow banks to take custody and lend against Bitcoin \u2013 a significant win for the industry.\n\nSpot ETF Approval\n\nCurrently, no spot Bitcoin ETF exists in the United States. As the name implies, a spot ETF is a mechanism to invest in Bitcoin \u201con the spot.\u201d The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), a non-spot Bitcoin ETF, is underperforming Bitcoin itself dramatically yea-to-date.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, BlackRock (BLK), the largest asset manager in the world, has applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF, along with others. With that in mind, the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF seems inevitable (out of more than 500 applications, BLK has only had one rejected in its history).\n\nSlowly, then All at Once\n\nAfter years of failures, the Bitcoin and crypto industry is inching closer to regulatory clarity due to recent court victories, new accounting standards, and the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Regulatory clarity will clear the way for institutional adoption. If institutional adoption is to take place, clear winners would be Bitcoin itself, Bitcoin proxies such as Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Coinbase, which will benefit from increased trading from institutions and custody of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This type of mining operation can reopen orphaned wells, often in remote areas such as in western Pennsylvania, that should otherwise be plugged or capped to prevent methane release and other types of pollution. The mobility and remoteness of these operations make them and their pollution difficult to quantify or mitigate.\n\nIn Elk County, Diversified LLC operates a gas well pad and uses fracked gas to fuel their cryptocurrency mining operations. In early 2023, environmental groups in Pennsylvania filed comments to the PA DEP urging the department to withdraw approval of Diversified\u2019s permit in Elk County \u2014 citing the energy-intensive nature of cryptocurrency mining, its threats to air quality, and Diversified\u2019s failure to meet critical PA DEP requirements.

        "title": "5 emerging 'new Bitcoin' alternative projects on the crypto market in 2023 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency and the largest by market cap. However, the top coin has been in a downtrend since November 2021 and has a number of limitations, most notably a lack of support for the smart contracts that have enabled NFTs, DeFi, crypto gaming and more.\n\nA growing number of projects are now building on Bitcoin to expand its utility and chart a new future for the original crypto. These high-risk \u201cnew Bitcoin\u201d alternatives can sometimes have more upside potential and offer faster, cheaper and greener transactions than the original BTC.\n\nNew Bitcoin alternatives\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at five of the new Bitcoin alternatives that are bringing Bitcoin into the future.\n\n1. Bitcoin BSC (BTCBSC) \u2014 Moving Bitcoin onto the BNB Smart Chain for faster and cheaper transactions\n\nBitcoin BSC is a newly-launched project that retools Bitcoin for Binance\u2019s BNB Smart Chain. It\u2019s a BEP-20 token that\u2019s compatible with a huge range of crypto wallets, DApps, DeFi protocols and more.\n\nSource: Bitcoin BSC\n\nPart of what makes Bitcoin BSC worth mentioning is that transactions on the BSC blockchain cost less than transactions on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.\n\nBitcoin BSC is also advertised to be far greener than Bitcoin, using less than 0.01% as much energy. The protocol is secured by a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism rather than Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work, so there\u2019s no computationally expensive mining required.\n\nInstead, BTCBSC investors are promised the option to stake their tokens to the project to validate transactions to receive additional BTCBSC coins.\n\nRight now, BTCBSC is on presale at bitcoinbsc.io priced at $0.99. The Bitcoin BSC project has gotten off to a strong start, raising more than $1 million its first week.\n\n2. BTC20 (BTC20) \u2014 Ethereum-based Bitcoin alternative with wide compatibility for DeFi and more\n\nBTC20 is another emerging Bitcoin clone project that\u2019s migrating BTC onto a faster, cheaper blockchain with support for proof-of-stake validation and smart contracts. In this case, the blockchain underlying BTC20 is the widely used Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThere are several benefits to reinventing Bitcoin on Ethereum. As an ERC-20 token, BTC20 is compatible with almost all major crypto wallets, DeFi protocols, crypto gaming platforms and decentralized marketplaces.\n\nSource: BTC20\n\nBTC20 has slightly higher transaction costs than Bitcoin BSC, largely because the Ethereum blockchain is so heavily used. However, there\u2019s a major convenience factor to having all of the biggest projects on one chain.\n\nThe BTC20 presale sold out more than $6 million worth of tokens at $1 per token and was listed on Uniswap in August. The current BTC20 price is $1.20.\n\n3. Bitcoin SV (BSV) \u2014 Greener proof-of-work blockchain processing 50,000 transactions per second\n\nBitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision, better known as Bitcoin SV or by its token BSV, recycles the original Bitcoin code to try to build a newer, faster and cheaper blockchain.\n\nSource: Bitcoin SV\n\nThe biggest and most consequential change that Bitcoin SV makes is allowing larger block sizes. This has a massive impact on the protocol\u2019s throughput. Bitcoin SV can process up to 50,000 transactions per second compared to around 7 transactions per second for Bitcoin.\n\nIt also dramatically lowers the effective energy cost of mining. It would take mining thousands of blocks on Bitcoin to achieve what mining a single block on Bitcoin SV does. So potentially, Bitcoin SV found a way to make proof-of-work validation far more environmentally sustainable, avoiding the carbon-emission concerns that plague Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin SV\u2019s blockchain also enables support for smart contracts and Bitcoin NFTs. It\u2019s quite forward-looking and has an active development team behind it, so it could adapt to changing crypto industry conditions in a way that Bitcoin cannot.\n\nBSV is currently priced at $30.5, down 42% over the past year.\n\n4. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) \u2014 2017 Bitcoin hard fork held by Grayscale Investments\n\nBitcoin Cash was an early fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that\u2019s still going strong today. It adopts the same principle as Bitcoin SV of using larger block sizes with more transactions to reduce costs and speed up processing.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash can currently manage around 200 transactions per hour. While that pales in comparison to Bitcoin SV, there are benefits to being more established. Bitcoin Cash was launched in 2017 and has a market cap of $3.75 billion, compared to less than $600 million for Bitcoin SV.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. That means it contains the same data as the Bitcoin blockchain up until the fork took place in 2017. This isn\u2019t the case for most other Bitcoin alternatives, which started from scratch when they launched.\n\nThe price of BCH is up nearly 50% over the past year, with a lot of that gain coming around a court decision in favor of Grayscale Investments\u2019 spot Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale has a Bitcoin Cash trust that some investors think could eventually be turned into its own spot ETF.\n\nOn top of that, the launch of a Bitcoin spot ETF has the potential to prop up all Bitcoin alternatives. An ETF makes the crypto market more accessible to everyone, and a subset of new investors are likely to start exploring Bitcoin alternatives that offer faster transactions and more features.\n\n5. Bitcoin Gold (BTG) \u2014 Bitcoin hard fork that makes mining accessible to all\n\nBitcoin Gold arose from another 2017 hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. At the time, ASIC processors were making Bitcoin mining increasingly challenging and boxing out individual miners. In the new world of ultra-heavy-duty mining equipment, only VC-backed miners could make money from Bitcoin mining.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Gold\n\nBitcoin Gold addressed this by modifying the mining algorithm to make it easier for transaction blocks to be mined. The project also limited mining to GPU processors, which are relatively affordable and already installed on many modern gaming computers and consoles.\n\nIn effect, this created a version of Bitcoin that\u2019s mined by individuals, not corporations. It looks a lot more like the early days of Bitcoin than Bitcoin does today.\n\nThis approach has kept Bitcoin Gold relatively small, and it currently has a market cap of only $222 million, according to CoinMarketCap. However, BTG has a devoted following and it\u2019s one of the only proof-of-work projects remaining for which individual miners can be reasonably competitive."

        "content": "The hashrate is the life blood of the Bitcoin Network, and it serves as perhaps the best proxy for adoption. It reflects the total amount of computing power \u2013 and, by extension, real-world expenditure of resources to generate electricity \u2013 that participants have allocated to securing their wealth contained within the network. The game theoretics are such that anyone who might consider attacking the network by spending billions of dollars to accrue 51% of the network computing power would be incentivized to instead participate in the generation of the next block, as their odds of receiving the next block reward would outpace any competitor. The Bitcoin network is complex and esoteric, and tiered education is central to incorporating more Salvadorans into the nascent Bitcoin economy."

        "content": "Executives from prominent mining and manufacturing firms believe market forces resulting from the fourth Bitcoin halving scheduled in 2024 could force the price of Bitcoin (BTC) past $100,000.\n\nMagazine editor Andrew Fenton spoke to Canaan vice president Davis Hui following a panel discussion at Canaan\u2019s Avalon Bitcoin and Crypto Day (ABCD) in Singapore.\n\nHui and a panel that included Bitcoin mining ecosystem executives from Singapore, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates all offered BTC price predictions around $100,000 in 2024 resulting from the effects of the latest Bitcoin mining reward halving.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin all-time high in 2025? BTC price idea reveals \u2018bull run launch\u2019\n\nHui told Cointelegraph that the supply of Bitcoin would be drastically reduced with the reward halving down to 6.25 BTC per block, while traditional finance institutions are showing increased interest in investing in the sector:\n\n\u201cWhat about BlackRock? They\u2019re holding onto $10 trillion of assets under management. The overall cryptocurrency market cap is $2 trillion \u2014 they have five times more than that.\u201d\n\nThe Canaan VP said his prediction was heavily influenced by the outcome of a number of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications lodged with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission by some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers.\n\n\u201cThis money will come in, the BTC demand will increase, while the supply has decreased, and the price will increase.\u201d\n\nHui also noted that it had become difficult for most miners to continue operating in highly competitive market conditions, with all-time hash rates and network difficulties directly eating into miner profitability.\n\nThose who could not cover electricity costs with the Bitcoin mining rewards earned will simply shut off those machines, while those who continue operating will do so with a view of the potential upside ahead of the 2024 halving, he said.\n\nMiners who can upgrade to more efficient and powerful machines are able to maintain better profitability, he said. Hui predicts that mining companies in the U.S. might be particularly hard pressed, given high electricity and administrative costs.\n\nHui also conceded that Canaan was among the industry companies to have reported a financial loss in the first quarter of 2023, highlighting the impact of a prolonged cryptocurrency bear market.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "There was red ink across the crypto market Monday morning in Asia as Bitcoin dipped below the resistance level of US$26,000. Ether also fell to near the US$16,000 mark after a hack on the X account of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses. Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers with a 24-hour slide of over 6%. Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX could soon get the greenlight to liquidate its US$3.4 billion in crypto holdings, adding to selling pressure in the market. U.S. stock futures traded higher after Wall Street logged weekly losses Friday. Investors now look ahead to the release of more U.S. inflation data later in the week for clues on upcoming interest rate policy.\n\nLatest FTX news depresses crypto market\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.25% in the last 24 hours to US$25,831.97 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. It lost 0.53% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly traded above US$26,000 last Friday. But it soon lost that support level and remained range bound over the weekend at around US$25,900.\n\nEther, the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token, fell 1.12% to US$1,616.79, and dropped 1.18% over the past seven days.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked Sunday, leading to losses totalling around US$691,000 for some of Buterin\u2019s followers, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. Hackers posted links to a scam non-fungible token (NFT) project on Buterin\u2019s Twitter page, advising users to connect their crypto wallets before withdrawing the funds.\n\nButerin\u2019s father confirmed in a tweet Sunday that his son had been hacked and was restoring his X account. The alleged scam post has now been removed from the account. Buterin himself is yet to comment on the hack.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses in the past 24 hours. Solana led the losers, falling 6.17% to US$18.25 for a weekly loss of 6.80%.\n\nOn Sunday, a Wall Street Journal report predicted a September pause in the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hiking cycle. The report \u201cprobably had many investors re-thinking their valuations \u2014 not just for crypto but for risk assets in general,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nThe market is also facing downward pressure from the latest FTX news. The collapsed cryptocurrency exchange is likely to receive approval on Sept.13 to start liquidating its crypto holdings, according to a tweet Saturday from blockchain analysts Whale Alert.\n\n\ud83d\udea8POTENTIALLY BIG SELLING NEXT WEEK\n\n\n\nCrypto exchange FTX will likely get approval to liquidate its assets 13th of September.\n\n\n\nThey had $3.4b worth of crypto in April.\n\nCurrent proposed plan is to sell up to $200m worth of crypto every week. \u2014 Whale (@WhaleChart) September 9, 2023\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy in November 2022, the exchange still holds an estimated US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets. Part of the bankruptcy plan set up for the firm allows for the sale of up to US$100 million in crypto assets per week, which can be extended to US$200 million under certain circumstances.\n\nCrypto analysts suggest the news could weigh on the market after gains earlier in the summer. Blockchain research firm IntoTheBlock tweeted Sunday that \u201cdespite positive news about Visa and a potential spot ETH ETF, FTX\u2019s impending US$3 billion liquidation could be dictating market movement.\u201d\n\nThe selling pressure from FTX will cause altcoins to underperform Bitcoin throughout the remainder of the year, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in a Sunday LinkedIn post.\n\nThe potential selling of FTX\u2019s crypto holdings could hit Solana particularly hard, according to Rachael Lucas, crypto technical analyst at Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets. The token \u201cforms a substantial portion of these assets, with an estimated value of approximately $685 million. This impending event has heightened the sense of uncertainty among SOL investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is on the verge of a \u201cdeath cross\u201d \u2014 where the token\u2019s short-term, 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) moves below its long-term, 200-day SMA. That could signal a coming slide in Bitcoin prices, Lucas said.\n\nAs of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, Bitcoin\u2019s 50-day SMA sat at US$27,658.19, with a 200-day SMA of US$27,608.57. Following the previous Bitcoin death cross on Jan.14, 2022, the token\u2019s price dropped over 10% within seven days.\n\n\u201cThe looming question that occupies the minds of market participants pertains to whether Bitcoin will chart a similar course in response to this bearish technical pattern or has the market already priced in this event?\u201d Lucas said.\n\n\u201cThis uncertainty is exacerbated by the forthcoming release of U.S. inflation figures, with technical indicators currently signalling the potential for further downside,\u201d she added.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.74% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 50.61% to US$20.25 billion.\n\nInvestors await key US inflation data as China slump slows\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures edged up as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. All three major U.S. indexes closed moderately higher on Friday but logged weekly losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the winners on Friday with a 0.22% uptick, but ended the week 0.86% lower.\n\nThe main stock indexes in Asia were mixed on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and South Korea\u2019s Kospi moved higher. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 1.38% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 also posted a 0.19% loss.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland last Friday.\n\nA recent rise in oil prices and stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. services recorded last week have fueled inflation concerns in the U.S., Reuters reported Saturday.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that the CPI print could come in higher than expected (with) the price of oil pushing higher,\u201d Phil Blancato, chief executive officer of U.S.-based investment advisory firm Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, said in the report.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem where ultimately the Fed may be pushed into a corner, and while they might take a pause because of the lag effect, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re done,\u201d said Blancato.\n\nThe CPI prediction of 3.8% is still higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term goal of reducing the annual inflation rate below 2%. The Fed raised the interest rate in July to between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level since early 2001.\n\nThe U.S. CPI data on Wednesday is unlikely to affect Fed thinking ahead of its September meeting, Mohamed A. El-Erian, an adviser to Germany-based financial services firm Allianz, tweeted on Monday. But it could influence future rate decisions, beginning November, he said.\n\nTwo items lead the week ahead for the global #economy and #markets:\n\nAn @ECB meeting where I put the probability of a 25 basis point hike at 55% (yes, it\u2019s that close); and\n\nThe US CPI #inflation print which is unlikely to alter in any significant way the high expectation that\u2026 \u2014 Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) September 10, 2023\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September. It gives a 53.5% chance for another pause in November, down from 57.4% last Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s CPI index posted a slim annual increase of 0.1% in August. The increase has eased deflationary pressure on Beijing slightly\n\n\u201cMany data we\u2019re seeing now shows that the economy\u2019s slump may be slowing in the coming months,\u201d Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., told Bloomberg. Yeung also noted a slowdown in China\u2019s export slump in August. But he said the slowdowns should not be read as a sign of long-term recovery just yet.\n\n\u201cIt will be more of a stabilization instead of a complete rebound,\u201d Yeung said.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin stands at the edge of a bearish breakdown, with a small possibility that the $25,000 support level could hold.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Bitcoin (BTC) broke from its parallel range between $25,500 and $26,500, falling to an intraday low at $24,950. A daily close below $24,750 threatens a drop to the sub-$20,000 range, but there\u2019s a slight chance that the bullish momentum could revive.\n\nAccording to pseudonymous trader Horse, Bitcoin at $25,000 presents a short-term buying opportunity, as it\u2019s the \u201cbest area to trap sellers\u201d and \u201carguably the best place for long contextual\u201d risk-to-reward ratio.\n\nI feel like the chances that the market smokes this level after the first major test is slim.\n\n\n\nSeems like the best area to trap sellers, and arguably the best place for long contextual R:R\n\n\n\nI'll catch a falling knife. pic.twitter.com/eFNMzBCPJW \u2014 HORSE (@TheFlowHorse) September 11, 2023\n\nThe price action in global markets and on-chain indicators tapping historical lows could give buyers hope that a positive trend could thrive.\n\nIs DXY tapping out?\n\nBitcoin tends to maintain a negative correlation with the U.S. dollar and a positive correlation with stocks.\n\nOn Sept. 11, when the S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock market indexes were trading higher, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) was falling.\n\nThe DXY is tapping its long-term range high levels around 104.8 points, hinting at the possibility of a negative price reversal. A bearish dollar could add tailwinds to Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nDaily chart of the DXY. Source: TradingView\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) print in the United States on Sept. 13 will likely provide a decisive direction to the global markets.\n\nBitcoin traders could secure profits at $26,000\n\nAccording to the latest report by on-chain analytics outlet Glassnode, Bitcon\u2019s price drop over the last few weeks has caused several metrics to tap historical lows.\n\nThe current market conditions are characterized by low liquidity and low trading volumes. While this complicates bulls\u2019 ability to push the BTC price through multiple resistance levels, long-term holders could start to accumulate as bullish hype cools down.\n\nAccording to Glassnode:\n\n\u201cRealized Profit and Loss are similarly at levels equivalent to the 2020 market, highlighting what is arguably a complete and total wash-out of the exuberance from the 2021 bull market.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin\u2019s negative price action since mid-August has seen a \u201cvast majority\u201d of short-term supply plunge \u201cinto an unrealized loss,\u201d which could act as a potential short-term reversal level.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s short-term holder supply in profit.

        "title": "Bitcoin derivatives data suggests BTC price holds the current range - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin experienced a 5% increase after testing the $25,000 support level on Sept. 11. However, this breakout rally doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a victory for bulls. To put today\u2019s price action in perspective, Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a 15% decline since July. In contrast, the S&P 500 index and gold have maintained relatively stable positions during this period.\n\nThis underperformance demonstrates that Bitcoin has struggled to gain momentum, despite significant catalysts such as MicroStrategy's plan to acquire an additional $750 million worth of BTC and the multiple requests for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from trillion-dollar asset management firms. Still, according to Bitcoin derivatives, bulls are confident that $25,000 marked a bottom and opened room for further price gains.\n\nBitcoin/USD vs. gold and S&P 500 futures, 12-hour time frame. Source: TradingView\n\nSome argue that Bitcoin\u2019s primary drivers for 2024 are still in play, specifically the prospects of a spot ETF and the reduction in new supply following the April 2024 halving. Additionally, some of the cryptocurrency markets\u2019 immediate risks have diminished following the United States Securities and Exchange Commission experiencing partial losses in three separate cases, involving Grayscale, Ripple and the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nOn the other hand, bears have their own set of advantages, including the ongoing legal cases against leading exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Moreover, there is the troubled financial situation of Digital Currency Group after one of its subsidiaries declared bankruptcy in January 2023. The group is burdened with debts exceeding $3.5 billion, potentially leading to the sale of funds managed by Grayscale, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\nA look at derivatives metrics will better explain how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin futures and options metrics held steady despite the correction\n\nBitcoin monthly futures typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, BTC futures contracts should typically trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the demand for leveraged BTC long and short positions through futures contracts did not have a significant impact on the drop below the $25,000 mark on Sept. 11. However, the BTC futures premium continues to hover below the 5% neutral threshold. This metric remains in the neutral-to-bearish range, indicating a lack of demand for leveraged long positions.\n\nTo gauge market sentiment further, it\u2019s helpful to look at the options markets, as the 25% delta skew can assess whether the retest of the $25,000 level has made investors more optimistic. In short, if traders expect a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the skew metric will rise above 7%, while periods of excitement typically have a -7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe situation underwent a notable shift on Sept. 11, as the 25% delta skew metric \u2014 which previously indicated a 9% premium on protective put options, suggesting investors were expecting a correction \u2014 has now leveled off at zero. This indicates balanced pricing between call and put options, implying equal odds for both bullish and bearish price movements.\n\nMacroeconomic uncertainty favors bears, but BTC bulls remain confident\n\nGiven the uncertainty on the macroeconomic front, particularly with the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index report on Sept. 13 and retail sales data on Sept. 14, it\u2019s likely that crypto traders will be cautious and prefer a \u201creturn to the mean.\" In this context, the mean represents the predominant trading range of $25,500 to $26,200 observed over the past couple of weeks.\n\nHowever, from a bullish perspective, the fact that derivatives markets held up during the dip below $25,000 is a promising sign. In other words, if bears had significant conviction, one would expect a stronger appetite for put options and a negative BTC futures premium, known as \u201cbackwardation.\"\n\nUltimately, both bulls and bears have significant triggers that could influence the price of Bitcoin, but predicting the timing of events such as court decisions and ETF rulings is challenging. This dual uncertainty likely explains why derivatives metrics have remained resilient, as both sides exercise caution to avoid excessive exposure.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Which Bitcoin Mining Stock Is a Better Buy: Riot or Marathon? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Competition in the Bitcoin mining sector is intense, with Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.05%) and Marathon Digital (MARA -8.61%) emerging as the top contenders. While both are currently positioned at the forefront, there are numerous industry-specific factors that can help investors understand why one company is the actual Bitcoin (BTC -1.26%) mining leader.\n\nMeasuring production\n\nWhile Marathon finished sixth in total Bitcoin mining production last year, 2023 is a different story. Currently ranked second, Marathon has mined just over 6,300 Bitcoins this year and led all miners with nearly 1,200 Bitcoins mined in July alone.\n\nThe jump in production can primarily be attributed to the company's strategy to get more miners online. Since the beginning of the year, Marathon's installed hash rate (a metric that quantifies a company's operational computing power) has more than doubled from just 11 exahashes per second (EH/s, a measure of computing power applied to mining cryptocurrencies) in January to 23 EH/s in August. This record-level production has bolstered Marathon's cache of 11,400 Bitcoins at the beginning of the year to more than 13,000 today, collectively worth $335.5 million at today's prices.\n\nWhile Marathon's production has skyrocketed in 2023, Riot's operations have been more consistent over the years. Today, Riot sits in third place in total Bitcoin production for 2023 and finished 2022 ranked second. Riot's hash rate today is just shy of 11 EH/s, good enough to produce more than 4,300 Bitcoins in 2023 and add to its total reserves of almost 7,300 Bitcoins valued at around $188 million.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nWhen comparing Marathon and Riot in terms of production and total Bitcoin reserves, Marathon clearly shines. However, like in any industry, increased revenue is insignificant if margins are narrowing.\n\nThis is where Riot excels. The company has some of the lowest operational expenses of all Bitcoin miners, with an average cost per Bitcoin mined of just $8,400. Conversely, Marathon has the fifth-highest costs at just under $19,000 per Bitcoin mined. These elevated costs are impacting Marathon's gross margin, which is a measly 32.5% today and falling from 42% last year. Even though Riot's production has not increased as fast as Marathon's, Riot's balance and efficiency of the total mining process are padding profits, with gross margin currently at 70% and growing from 60% last year.\n\nThere are likely two reasons for Riot's remarkable efficiency and subsequent healthier margins. First would be Riot's strategic location in Texas. Due to the Lone Star State's unregulated electricity market, which allows consumers to sell unused energy to the grid, Riot can earn power curtailment credits to offset costs. This is especially helpful when energy costs are greater than the profits Riot would secure from mining, a scenario that occurs when the grid is under high demand or Bitcoin's price slips. When this happens, Riot can divert the energy back to the grid and still earn a profit. While Marathon has some facilities in Texas, all of Riot's operations are in the state.\n\nFurther benefiting Riot's wide margins is its lack of long-term debt. Oftentimes, miners will take on debt to finance their operations and expand capabilities; this is the path that Marathon chose to take. Subsequently, Marathon has some of the highest debt in the industry.\n\nAstonishingly, Riot has zero long-term debt. The company's ability to rise to the top of the Bitcoin mining industry with virtually no debt is a testament to its resiliency and strategic vision. In fact, Riot's new Corsicana facility, which is currently under construction and will add up to 8 EH/s to its hash rate, is already fully funded without tapping into external financing.\n\nThe final verdict\n\nAt first glance, Marathon's record increases in production in 2023 would likely catch the attention of most investors. But with some digging and further evaluation, it becomes evident that Riot's robust financial health and industry-leading efficiency put it head and shoulders above the competition.\n\nIn an industry where profits correlate to Bitcoin's volatile price, investors must prioritize companies built for the long haul and with proven resiliency. From this perspective, the choice between Marathon and Riot becomes abundantly clear."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose slightly on Tuesday afternoon in Asia but remained below the support level of US$26,000. Ether traded below US$1,600, with XRP leading losses across most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos, as news of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX possibly selling its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets by the end of the year weighed on crypto markets. Investors are also looking forward to August inflation data from the U.S. due for release on Wednesday.\n\nSee related article: Standard Chartered\u2019s crypto custody arm Zodia launches in Singapore\n\nNegative sentiment across crypto market\n\nBitcoin gained marginally by 0.05% to US$25,819 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly gains to 0.40%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency remained below the support level of US$26,000 as negative market sentiment lingered.\n\n\u201cThe declines in cryptocurrencies came as negative sentiment continued to flow into the markets, in light of the state of anticipation of what might happen on the regulatory side of this market in the United States,\u201d said Samer Hasn, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage firm XS.com.\n\nThe U.S. will release August inflation data on Wednesday. \u201cThe expectations are for a slight increase in year-on-year inflation, to 3.4% from 3.2% of July. However, the market does not expect any further increase in interest rates, pricing a 93% probability of no change in interest rates at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and also not predicting any further rate hike before the end of 2023,\u201d said Matteo Greco, research analyst at the publicly listed digital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia International.\n\n\u201cThe end of rate hikes, especially if combined with approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF [exchange traded fund], could represent a major driver to bring new capital into the market and improve liquidity,\u201d Greco said in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second biggest cryptocurrency, fell 1.97% to US$1,579 in the past 24 hours, and dropped 2.71% on the week.\n\n\u201cThe break of US$1,650 makes us extremely cautious about Ether, and we could even envision a scenario where prices drop lower into year-end,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed report.\n\n\u201cA decline below US$1,500 could bring back the idea that Ether could decline to US$1,000 \u2014 a level that would appear justified based on the revenue projection from the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nCrypto market is also under pressure as FTX crypto exchange, which went into bankruptcy in November 2022, is likely to receive court approval on Wednesday to liquidate an estimated crypto holding of US$3.4 billion. The firm proposed to sell up to US$100 million in crypto assets per week, which could be extended to US$200 million.\n\nAccording to Thielen, although sales might have a cap of US$200 million per week, it still implies that FTX creditors could sell every week.\n\n\u201cIt also indicates that crypto will see another US$3.4 billion in crypto-to-fiat off-ramping \u2014 a potential liquidity gap that might be hard to fill in the absence of Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Silvergate Bank, which were responsible for at least, 50% of all the fiat-to-crypto on-ramping during the last few years,\u201d Thielen pointed out.\n\nAltcoins could be particularly impacted \u201cdue to unfavorable tokenomics that compel early investors in projects to make prudent financial and survival decisions, and liquidate positions,\u201d he added.\n\nFTX is not the only major player selling assets. Crypto venture capital (VC) funds are also under immense pressure to return funds to their investors.\n\n\u201cWhile some crypto VC funds made 10-20x returns, several have had substantial drawdowns, leading investors to prefer cashing out \u2014 even if returns were materially higher. For example, Multicoin Capital lost 91% of its value in 2022,\u201d Thielen said.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization fell 0.62% to US$1.03 trillion while market volume rose 82.81% to US$37.73 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum NFT sales volume rise\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.34% to 2,092.68 in 24 hours to 5.45 p.m. in Hong Kong, and dropped 3.43% over the past seven days. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon indexes also declined.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume rose 25.25% to US$10.81 million, while transactions gained 5.23% to 236,393, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nAmong blockchains, Ethereum topped the rankings by sales volume, which rose 42.69% to US$5.89 million in the past 24 hours. This was followed by the Mythos network, which rose 11.65% to US$1.15 million.\n\nThe Polygon blockchain, ranked third, dropping 9.26% to US$824,236.\n\nAccording to Hasn of XS.com, Binance\u2019s intention to delist Polygon network from its NFT marketplace pushed the price of the network\u2019s token (MATIC) to its lowest level this year.\n\n\u201cThe delisting of Polygon from Binance NFT Marketplace adds to the series of negative news swirling in this already turbulent market, in which traders are still living in a state of anticipation about what the regulatory and legal environment might be like,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nAmong collections, Mythos-based DMarket topped rankings with its sales volume rising 11.14% to US$1.14 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nGlobal markets fall ahead of crucial U.S. inflation data, ECB policy meeting\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian stock markets were mostly down on Tuesday in anticipation of the latest U.S. inflation data due for release on Wednesday. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component Index, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index dropped at the end of trading hours. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained.\n\nA Sept. 4-11 Reuters poll of 76 analysts, based in and outside mainland China, predicted China\u2019s economy would grow 5% this year, lower than 5.5% forecast in a July survey. In 2024, the poll forecasts a 4.5% gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and 4.3% in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe primary culprit is the property sector. This source of growth has now evaporated and won\u2019t be coming back,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics in Singapore, according to the Reuters report.\n\nIndia\u2019s benchmark index Sensex rose 0.14% at the close of trading hours on Tuesday.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinath told India Today that India will be the world\u2019s third-largest economy in four years. Gopinath also said the world\u2019s most populous nation will contribute 15% of global growth this year.\n\nU.S. stock futures weakened as of 7 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the red.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI), a key inflation indicator, for August will be released on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland expects the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July.\n\nThe latest inflation report will provide further insights into the U.S. central bank\u2019s future monetary policies, which aims to bring the annual inflation rate below 2%. The Federal Reserve in July raised interest rates in the world\u2019s largest economy to between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest in the past 22 years.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the U.S. central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September.\n\nEuropean bourses \u2013 the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 \u2013 fell in afternoon trade on Tuesday. Investors are looking forward to the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) policy meeting on Thursday, which is expected to indicate whether the central bank will increase interest rates further.\n\n\u201cThe European Central Bank would risk plunging the European Union into a long recession if it decides to raise interest rates at its pivotal meeting on Thursday, following the growth downgrades of the bloc by the European Commission,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\n\u201cThe 0.4% contraction in Germany\u2019s economy, coupled with the European Commission\u2019s downward revision of growth expectations, suggests that the trajectory might be less stable than anticipated,\u201d Green pointed out.\n\n\u201cDespite the risks of steering the wider EU into a recession with another rate rise, we expect that the ECB will argue it is still too soon to pause in its battle against inflation and, therefore, will go for one final hike on Thursday.\u201d\n\n(updates with equities section)"

        "content": "Bitcoin remains under 26,000 as investors await fresh us economic data this week. Joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is Maple head of growth and capital markets. Quinn Thompson. Welcome back, Quinn. Yeah, thanks for having me. Good seeing you. So, um you know, before we get into this whole discussion of uh some of the, the CP I and PP I data that we're gonna have come out this week. Uh You're, you're kind of looking at the ETF news and you see that as a as I I as it's kind of the next big thing happening here, particularly uh a spot E ETF for, for E, you know, we're as close as possible uh that we've ever been to a Bitcoin spot ETF with the, with the latest ruling in the federal courts against uh the sec regarding gray scale, why the, the market hasn't really taken off since then? So what is it that, you know, that the rest of the market doesn't? Yeah, I mean, so the ETF is definitely the, the, the biggest news I'd say holding the crypto markets up today and, and probably over the next coming months the difficult part is it, it creates a better conduit for, for capital inflows into the space, but you still need that catalyst for those inflows. And if you look at, you know, interest rates are about up about 50 basis points since uh Bitcoin's most recent local peak at 31 K, uh you know, liquidity and capital inflows continue to kind of decrease. And so we just haven't seen a catalyst for people to get excited. There continues to be quite a few headwinds whether it's B news, other FTX type of cell pressure. Uh No one really wants to step in. And if you look at the trading action over the last few, few weeks and months, you know, it, it tells you that much. It's, it's everyone's pretty apathetic towards, towards crypto at this stage. We're, we're, we're, we're expected to get some PP I and CP I data this week. Uh As you know, obviously it's the end of August is now behind us. So we're gonna know what's going on there. What exact, you know, where do you see that falling? Because that of course, is going to dictate where interest rates are going to go or at least give a hint as to where interest rates are gonna go. What, what's your bet? Yeah, I think the, you know, I'm not, I'm not sure about this exact print, but if you look across the commodity complex, I I it feels that, you know, the economy is not as weak as, as people might be thinking, you know, labor data has been mixed, uh inflation data has definitely come down but, but very well could have seen a bottom over the summer and, and commodities due to, you know, recent, recent supply issues. And despite all the talk of China and, and the rest of the world being very weak, uh you know, you can look to commodities as, as being pretty strong here. And so my gut says, you know, we've probably seen a local bottom in inflation and, and one of the things causing weakness in tech assets over the last couple of weeks is, is those rising expectations and, and interest rates coinciding with it. Yeah. Now I'm surprised Lawrence didn't ask you this about ETF S. We've had spot ETF S up here in Canada where I'm sitting right now and the excitement hasn't been there. So, I mean, what do you do? You really think it's gonna be this, this big catalyst that everyone is thinking it's gonna be given that it's been available in some other parts of the world. And the excitement has kind of just been exactly how the markets have looked over the past few weeks. No, that's, that's very accurate. I mean, as I kind of said it, it, you know, it, it's not an instant rep pricing of, of the space, but you would expect some uplift in prices as you know, it creates a, you know, better, better avenue for, for capital inflows. If you think across the US, there's, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars managed by Ria S wealth advisors and other asset managers who physically cannot access uh digital currencies, Bitcoin Ethereum. And so the ETF really allows that access to, to be much improved. And, and also, you know, if you think of a traditional wealth advisor in, in a regional part of the States, they can't make money. If they, they tell their clients to invest in Bitcoin, they have no way to, you know, it has to be done through traditional uh investment routes and, and getting an EPF approved will, will allow that to be supported in, in, you know, all these different accounts. So I think it is big news. I just, I just think there needs to be other uh catalysts to get the space going again and, and we'll see how big, I mean, do you have an estimate on, on what you think will ultimately take up? Uh the TFS? How, how big do you think are we looking at here? Because, I mean, the Canadians haven't been impressive as usual. Yeah. Well, the, the Bitcoin futures et FBI to is, is been pretty successful, I would say for the type of product it is. Um I, I believe that's about a billion. The, you know, just look to the gray scale uh G BC. There's I believe about 16 billion at, at today's prices uh locked up there. So tough to say the discount's still there. Um You know, and, and so there could be some outflows if, if it returns to NAV, but, but overall, you know, I, I would expect over the coming years is to be 30 40 50 billion. And, and um you know, that that's a meaningful size of, of the overall crypto and Bitcoin market at, at this stage. Yeah, and talk to us about some of the issues challenges, I guess when it comes to capital flow right now in the digital asset space. Yeah, I mean this the stable coin supply is probably the easiest gauge you can look to there's other some fun metrics um that, that some people post but overall, it's, it's pretty bleak and US DC supply has been been cut in half which is kind of the western regulated stable coin. Obviously, Tether has been uh pretty strong in its growth which you know, take, take of it where you will. But overall, uh you know, investment and you look at venture capital raising uh that it's continues to hit new lows, trading volumes continue to hit new lows. And so there's just this kind of lack of, of excitement and and broader interest in the space. I think part of that has to do with the regulatory uh nature. But, but you are starting to see the currents kind of shift underneath where some of this, you know, or, or less value or creative building and, and project use cases are being washed out. You know, you're seeing more and more startups, kind of shut it down where they haven't found product market fit and, and fail where they haven't been able to raise additional capital and that's healthy. You know, it's unfortunate, but, but, you know, venture capital is a, is a type of investing where you, you hit a home run on one or two of every 10. So I think it's a little return to normal and, and you know, we're starting to see that capital then float to the more uh you know, a creative and u real use cases like stable coins, payment rails and, and that's one bright spot, transactions across stable coins have continued to increase despite, you know, the broader Bitcoin weakness. So I think that's kind of what will lift us out of this, this bear market is, is, you know, big players like visa and other payment companies start to adopt these rails and, and that just continues to onboard new users into the space. Quinn, thanks so much for joining us this morning and taking a look at the markets with us. Yeah, thanks so much. That was Maple Head of growth and capital markets, Quinn Thompson."

        "content": "A debate has reignited among Bitcoiners over a six-year-old Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to add \u201csidechains\u201d on top of the network, with some warning it could increase scams on the Bitcoin network and others saying it will bring new users of the cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, one developer claims to have found a way to achieve the proposal\u2019s goal without a soft fork of the blockchain.\n\nThe proposal in question, BIP-300 \u2014 also known as Bitcoin (BTC) Drivechains \u2014 was first introduced in 2017, which proposed introducing \u201csidechains\u201d that are separate blockchains on top of the Bitcoin network.\n\nPaul Sztorc, the proposal\u2019s author and founder of the Drivechain development firm LayerTwo Labs \u2014 which raised $3 million in December \u2014 has explained that the blockchains would allow for BTC to move onto them and create altcoins.\n\nThis is how Bip300 can eliminate all crypto and fiat transactions, leaving only Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/1TwQsu9ZPj \u2014 LayerTwo Labs (@LayerTwoLabs) July 10, 2023\n\nThe debate over the proposal was kicked up again on Aug. 22, when a Bitcoin core developer known as Luke Dashjr rewrote the proposal\u2019s code and requested to add it to Bitcoin\u2019s codebase.\n\nBIP-300 would require a soft fork of Bitcoin that would be activated by miners \u2014 not unlike the Taproot soft fork in November 2021 that paved the way for the equally controversial nonfungible tokenemulating Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens that launched earlier this year.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Maxim Orlovsky, the CEO of blockchain scaling solutions project Pandora, posted on X (Twitter) claiming he was able to create a two-way peg on Bitcoin without a soft fork of the blockchain, which BIP-300 requires.\n\nJust understood that one can do cryptoeconomically-safe trustless 2WP on #Bitcoin without any softfork today - using Prometheus - our 5-year old proposal for arbitrage of any high-load Turing-complete computing on top of Bitcoin: https://t.co/NljYszgkk7 pic.twitter.com/wV5MDuqUov \u2014 Maxim Orlovsky (@dr_orlovsky) September 10, 2023\n\nIn an accompanying note, Orlovsky explained an old project proposal could work as a BIP-300 alternative with an oracle working to validate a sidechain and \u201cthe protocol will reach consensus on whether the state reported by the oracle is correct.\u201d\n\nDetails, so far, are sparse. Orlovsky said he would work on a paper describing the setup \u201cin [an] understandable way.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, BIP-300 proponents, including Sztorc, argue that Drivechains will allow users to choose a blockchain security model they agree with and how they want their Bitcoin to work. Sztorc also claimed the proposal has \u201cenormous upside\u201d with \u201cliterally zero downside.\u201d\n\nRelated: No, Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges are not inherently bullish for crypto\n\nOthers, including Cory Klippsten, the chief of the BTC-only exchange Swan Bitcoin, rejected the proposal \u2014 with Klippsten claiming Drivechains would increase the amount of scams on Bitcoin, which may catch the ire of regulators.\n\nOne potential downside of Drivechains:\n\n\n\nHaving lots of scams on Bitcoin will make people and regulators (understandably) think that Bitcoin is full of scams. \u2014 Cory Klippsten | Swan.com #Bitcoin (@coryklippsten) August 27, 2023\n\nPierre Rochard, the vice president of research forBitcoin miner Riot Platforms, said the proposal\u2019s messaging relies on \u201cspeculative economic arguments rather than substantive engineering ones\u201d and added it was \u201cpure hopium.\u201d\n\nDrivechain\u2019s \u201cforce a softfork to kill sh*tcoins\u201d marketing somehow manages to be both anti-bitcoin and anti-\u201ccrypto\u201d. Also pure hopium. It\u2019s a distraction. Strong NACK. \u2014 Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) August 21, 2023\n\nOthers who lent their voice to support BIP-300 included educator Dan Held, who claimed that Bitcoin is better off with more speculative assets as they \u201cintroduce new audiences to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin wallet provider Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp said he\u2019s yet to see a \u201cconvincing concern\u201d of how sidechains could be dangerous to the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nI'm generally in favor of finally fulfilling the promise of 2-way pegged sidechains. I've yet to see a convincing concern of how it could be dangerous to the main chain. Some folks have said it could be dangerous if a sidechain became more valuable than the base chain, but seems\u2026 \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) August 30, 2023\n\nHe added if a sidechain becomes more valuable, it could signal that the base chain \u201cshould implement that sidechain\u2019s features.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions \u2014 Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box, former PayPal President David Marcus shared his vision for Bitcoin, aiming to transform it into a global payment network. Marcus, who is the CEO of Lightning Network infrastructure company Lightspark, emphasized the importance of expanding Bitcoin's utility beyond just a store of value.\n\nDuring the interview, Marcus highlighted the significant strides Bitcoin has made over the past decade, evolving from an obscure digital currency to a recognized store of value and hedge against inflation. However, he argued that Bitcoin could play a much broader role in the global financial ecosystem.\n\nMarcus proposed that Bitcoin has the potential to become a truly global payment network, similar to PayPal but operating on the decentralized Bitcoin network. He emphasized the need for Bitcoin to evolve further, offering faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions, making it accessible to a broader audience.\n\nDavid Marcus is helping lead the charge to expand Bitcoin's utility in this area. In his current role as CEO of Lightspark, he has committed \"to doing whatever it took\" to realize the full potential of the Bitcoin Lightning Network. \"Because it\u2019s time for the world to have a universal open protocol for payments,\" Marcus continued.\n\nThough, scaling Bitcoin into a massive global payment network is not without challenges. Bitcoin's scalability issues has had its long-standing concerns. However, ongoing technological developments, such as the Lightning Network, aim to address these issues and enhance Bitcoin's capabilities.\n\nRegulatory hurdles also pose a significant challenge. Governments around the world are scrutinizing the Bitcoin industry, with varying degrees of acceptance and regulation. Marcus acknowledged the importance of working with regulators to ensure the compliance and legitimacy of Bitcoin as a global payment solution.\n\nWhile significant challenges lie ahead, including technical and regulatory hurdles, the idea of Bitcoin serving as a decentralized, efficient, and widely accepted means of payment holds the potential to revolutionize the financial industry, making transactions faster and more accessible on a global scale.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Wednesday morning in Asia to near US$26,000, after sinking below the key support level of US$25,000 on Tuesday for the first time in three months. Ether also bounced back to near US$1,600 as all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged gains with Toncoin leading the winners with a 24-hour surge of over 12%. The rally followed the recent panic sell-off over an incoming liquidation from collapsed crypto exchange FTX, which is expected to unload its US$3.4 billion crypto holdings by the end of the year. U.S. stock futures traded flat after Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday amid oil price concerns.\n\nBitcoin nears US$26,000; Overreactions towards FTX liquidation plan?\n\nBitcoin rose 3.02% in the last 24 hours to US$25,867.44 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, adding 0.36% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly touched an almost three-month-low of US$24,930.30 and bounced back to a high of US$26,451.94 on Tuesday.\n\nEther saw a similar rebound, rising 3.10% to US$1,595.00 but lost 2.28% in the past seven days. The second top crypto reached a 24-hour high of US$1,619.11 on Tuesday.\n\nThe current crypto market sentiment echoes \u201cthe late-stage bear market from 2015 and 2019,\u201d as \u201ca sustained period of poor momentum has pushed the fear and greed index to a nine-month low,\u201d crypto research firm K33 wrote in a report Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe worsening sentiment originates from anticipated sell-side pressure related to FTX balances of US$560 million BTC, US$192 million ETH, and US$1.16 billion SOL,\u201d wrote K33. \u201cThe market also expects further sellside pressure from Mt. Gox\u2019s trustees and U.S. Silk Road Bitcoins. The schedule and structure of these potential sell-side flows are unknown but have all been decisive forces in hammering an already pressured sentiment.\u201d\n\nFTX, which went into bankruptcy in November 2022, may receive court approval on Wednesday to sell its crypto holding that totals around US$3.4 billion. However, the recent sell-off ahead of the liquidation could be an overreaction, according to Greg Moritz, co-founder and chief operating officer of crypto hedge fund Alt Tab Capital.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cFTX, having an interest in acquiring the highest price for its assets, will likely go about the liquidation in an orderly and rational way that minimizes the effect on market pricing,\u201d said Moritiz in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cOverall, the actual impact of the potential FTX liquidation on the crypto market is likely to be quite small and take place over months, however, we already have downward pressure on many coins as a result of the proposal,\u201d Moritz added. \u201cThis is primarily due to the retail crypto market not fully understanding FTX\u2019s proposal and reacting based on fear rather than logic. When that happens, it tends to create attractive buying opportunities for savvy investors with a long-term focus.\u201d\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted gains in the past 24 hours. Toncoin led the winners, which rose 12.49% to US$1.84 and gained 3.73% for the week.\n\nToncoin is the native token of the Open Network (TON), a blockchain-based, decentralized network originally developed by messaging app Telegram, whose price has jumped over 30% in the past month. TON is set to have a presentation with Telegram at the ongoing Token2049 event in Singapore on Wednesday, with the theme: \u201cTransforming Telegram to Web3 with Toncoin.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 2.54% in the past 24 hours to US$1.03 trillion, as trading volume rose 9.22% to US$35.33 billion.\n\nU.S. stock futures flat before CPI release\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading flat as of 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Both Dow futures and S&P 500 futures inched 0.01% lower, while Nasdaq futures edged up 0.05%. All three major U.S. indexes booked losses during trading hours on Tuesday, with Nasdaq leading with a 1.04% drop.\n\nThe main stock indexes in Asia were mixed as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng moved up, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 logged losses.\n\nThe U.S.-based computer technology firm Oracle Corp. spearheaded the Wall Street decline on Tuesday, whose stock price closed the day 13.50% lower. The company on Monday reported its first-quarter revenue of the fiscal year 2024 and projection for second-quarter earnings, which were both below the expectations as the demand for cloud computing slows down.\n\nFollowing Oracle, cloud-heavy technology firms Microsoft and Amazon also booked losses on Tuesday, falling 1.83% and 1.31% respectively.\n\nOn the inflation front, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday, with analysts expecting an acceleration in annual inflation rate.\n\nAn annual growth in core CPI of over 4.5% can indicate a sticker-than-expected inflation, Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at investment advisor IG Australia Pty, told Bloomberg on Wednesday, which could make the S&P 500 \u201cboard the express train back to the August low 4,350/30 area.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, rising oil prices are adding to the inflation concerns, with the benchmark Brent Crude closing 1.6% higher at US$92.06 on Tuesday, the highest level since November 2022.\n\n\u201cPeople are a little bit worried about energy prices picking up pretty aggressively in recent weeks and that creates some concerns as we look forward to November\u201d, which could make the Federal Reserve raise interest rates again, Thomas Hayes, chairman at equity firm Great Hill Capital LLC., said, according to a Wednesday Reuters report.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 56.8% chance for another pause in November, down from 57.6% on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Swan denies customers\u2019 funds were lost in the Fortress hack.\n\nThe company has a range of security measures to prevent asset loss.\n\nRipple acquired Fortress and made whole customer losses.\n\nCryptocurrency hacks continue to plague the industry, undermining trust across the board. Blockchain security firm Peckshield underscored the scale of the problem by reporting that more than $3 billion was stolen by hackers in 2022.\n\nInfrastructure firm Fortress is the latest to fall prey to hackers, following the disclosure last week of a third-party API security breach in which an undisclosed amount was stolen. In the fallout, Swan Bitcoin, which uses Fortress for custody purposes, denied being affected by the hack.\n\nSwan Assures Customers\n\nSwan has addressed concerns that the Bitcoin stolen in the Fortress hack was siphoned from user holdings. A post from the company\u2019s X account stated that, during the hack, Swan customers\u2019 coins were safely held in cold storage with sub-custodian BitGo.\n\nThe tweet further sought to reassure customers that Swan utilizes various security procedures, including video calls, physical access, and on-chain visibility, to prevent asset loss.\n\nSwan client coins are in insured cold wallets at BitGo and did not move during the reported incident at Fortress. The coins are protected by video calls and physical access, and are not subject to any incidents at Fortress.\n\n\n\nSwan set up this agreement with Fortress to use BitGo\u2026 \u2014 Swan Bitcoin Adoption Team (@SwanBitcoin) September 11, 2023\n\nSwan managing director Steven Lubka explained that the \u201ctri-party\u201d model, involving Swan, Fortress, and BitGo, was implemented after the Prime Trust incident and required daily reconciliations between all parties and BitGo\u2019s approval to authorize transfers.\n\nPrime Trust filed for bankruptcy in August following a string of controversies that culminated in Nevada regulators placing the firm in receivership, which refers to a remedy for secured creditors to recover amounts owed. Prime Trust was Swan\u2019s custodian before Fortress\u2019 appointment, leading to Swan being heavily panned over the association, with this latest incident doing little to reassure Swan users that things have changed.\n\nMeanwhile, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe wasted no time joining Swan to distance his company from the fallout of the security breach.\n\nFortress Breached\n\nBelshe took Swan\u2019s lead, clarifying that BitGo was also unaffected by the hack. The BitGo CEO posted a lengthy tweet detailing his disappointment with Fortress on numerous counts, highlighting that the firm minced words to downplay the incident and suggest that customers had, in fact, not lost funds.\n\nBelshe further revealed that Fortress had contacted BitGo following the hack but ignored their advice to disclose the matter sooner. Fortress went public with the information on September 7, stating that it had suffered a security breach related to third-party API integrations at the end of August.\n\nAlthough it mentioned that four customers were affected by the incident, the company did not reveal the amount hackers stole. Fortress was subsequently acquired by Ripple, which paid to cover the resulting losses from the hack.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nSwan\u2019s Bitcoin maximalist principles clash with Ripple being the ultimate custodian of its customers\u2019 BTC.\n\nPrime Trust and Fortress were both founded by Scott Purcell, a fact Swan was doubtless aware of.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile Swan customers may have escaped unscathed, the Fortress hack has reignited doubts about Swan\u2019s partner selection process and due diligence procedures.\n\nDiscover the details behind the most expensive Bitcoin transaction fee ever recorded here:\n\nUser Pays $500,000 for a Single Bitcoin Transaction: Details\n\n\n\nUnderstand Brian Armstrong\u2019s take on the upcoming US presidential election here:\n\nCoinbase CEO: Crypto to Take Center Stage in 2024 US Election"

        "content": "The US-based asset management firm, Franklin Templeton entered the race to obtain approval for the first US exchange-traded fund (ETF) that directly invests in Bitcoin. Franklin Templeton filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today (Tuesday), joining the ranks of other asset managers like Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nIf the SEC gives the green light, Franklin Templeton intends to rely on Coinbase Global as the custodian for the ETF\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, while Bank of New York Mellon will handle the cash component of the fund.\n\nGrowing Interest in ETFs Fuels Bitcoin\n\nThe rise in the price of Bitcoin throughout the year can be partially attributed to the growing optimism that the largest asset management firms, including BlackRock and now Franklin Templeton, are showing an interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. This interest has sparked hopes that the SEC will be more inclined to approve such a fund despite previously rejecting such applications.\n\nThe supporters of spot Bitcoin ETFs argue that their introduction would open digital currencies to a broader base of investors, potentially driving the value of Bitcoin up. However, the SEC has raised concerns about the potential fraud and market manipulation in the past when rejecting similar applications.\n\nThe path toward spot Bitcoin ETF approval took a significant turn in August when Grayscale Investments secured a victory over the SEC, Finance Magnates reported. A federal appeals court overturned the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to transform its Bitcoin trust into a spot Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term ETF. The court dismissed the objection by the SEC as arbitrary and capricious, citing a lack of clear explanation.\n\nFranklin Templeton has been making notable strides in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. In 2021, the company launched a money market fund that leverages blockchain technology to record share ownership. The Franklin Onchain US Government Money Fund is currently valued at USD $295 million.\n\nShift to Ethereum ETFs\n\nAbout a week ago, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) submitted two applications to the SEC, seeking approval for the creation of the VanEck Ethereum ETF and the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF. If the applications are approved, these ETFs will be listed on the CBOE\u2019s BZX exchange.\n\nThe shift towards Ethereum Ethereum Ethereum is an open source, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality.

Although approval was obtained in 2021, the launch was postponed due to evolving conditions in the digital asset space."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) begins a key macro week in a weak place as 2023 BTC action begins to look like a \u201cdouble top.\u201d\n\nAfter a disappointing weekly close below $26,000, BTC/USD is struggling to catch a bid amid a return to low volatility.\n\nAnalysts, already predicting downside, continue to forecast new local lows, and liquidity conditions are increasingly supporting their argument.\n\nAre there any silver linings on the horizon? One on-chain metric suggests that Bitcoin is \u201cin the midst\u201d of a major shakeout akin to March 2020.\n\nA rebound to \u201cfair value\u201d may also come courtesy of Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), which has almost fully retraced its year-to-date gains to reach its lowest levels since the first week of January.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at these topics and more in the weekly rundown of key BTC price triggers.\n\nWeekly close makes BTC price double top a reality\n\nBitcoin closing out the week below key trendlines was already expected, but the reality may be worse than many care to admit.\n\nThat is the conclusion of popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital, who warned that a close below $26,000 would \u201clikely\u201d validate a double top structure on the BTC weekly chart.\n\nThis currently takes the form of Bitcoin\u2019s two 2023 local tops, both above $31,000, with a retracement to $26,000 in between, as data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nBTC price weakness now risks continuation downhill thanks to the latest close.\n\n\u201cWeekly close below ~$26,000 likely confirms the Double Top breakdown,\u201d Rekt Capital wrote in part of an X post.\n\nFurther analysis noted that $26,000 had formed support for three weeks running and that finally deciding its fate was thus significant on weekly timeframes.\n\nWith BTC/USD nonetheless seeing its lowest weekly close since March, popular chartist JT told X followers that there was still room for optimism. This, he argued, was in the form of the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) near $25,600.\n\n\u201cThis week candle was a spinning top doji, which is a candle that indicates indecision,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s quite remarkable though is that the past three weekly closes have closed within $400 of each other! Talk about boring and flat price action! The good news is we closed well above our weekly 200EMA ($25.6K).\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-week chart with 200 EMA.

A major gap on the radar currently lurks at $20,000.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only real CME gap that we have in terms of downside movement from current price levels,\u201d Rekt Capital explained in his latest YouTube update on Sept. 6.\n\nHe continued by noting a now-filled gap from June 2022 was now acting as resistance after functioning as support and resistance at various points since its creation.\n\n\u201cThis CME gap has been filled multiple times already and it\u2019s been flipped into a new resistance,\u201d he said, noting that the aforementioned double top completing would likewise feed into a return to the $20,000 zone.\n\nUnder such circumstances, a potential BTC price range would form, with the $20,000 gap and previously filled gap functioning as support and resistance, respectively.\n\nBTC/USD chart with CME gaps highlighted (screenshot).

These Gaps tend to get filled sooner or later. But there\u2019s no guarantee they will,\u201d popular trader Titan of Crypto argued.\n\nUploading a chart of historical gaps, he referenced another that is yet to fill, this time below $10,000.\n\n\u201cFor some of you who are in crypto for quite some time, you may recall the $9.6k gap from September 2020. Back then everyone was expecting this gap to get filled so they can finally buy Bitcoin again. Guess what? It remains unfilled to this day and many got back in at $20k+, fomoing like crazy,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is a gap that is still unfilled at $20k-$21k. Will it get filled?

It is a red line that we just don\u2019t cross,\u201d Chen says.\n\nBefore she started steering strategy at Bitget, Chen worked as an anchor and producer at Phoenix TV\u2019s tech and finance channel, a major player in China\u2019s media scene.\n\nHowever, a billion-dollar idea came knocking and quickly led Chen away from journalism.\n\nIn 2015, she co-founded a tax startup designed for freelancers, and it skyrocketed to unicorn status in just three years.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a financial tech company. So, what they do is they provide services for freelancers. They serve the freelancers and provide taxation and salary automation services,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, one of her proudest achievements was having football legend Lionel Messi join the Bitget team as a partner.\n\nChen says Messi faced stiff competition from many candidates, but Bitget ultimately selected him due to his paternal qualities and similarities with the exchange.\n\n\u201cHe had a good reputation as a father, husband and team leader, and also we kind of see some similarity between Bitget and Messi,\u201d she states.\n\nChen says that Bitget started in a bear market, and similarly, Messi suffered from growth hormone deficiency when he was young and first starting out in the sport.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not tall. He is at a disadvantage, so he had a very hard starting point as well.\u201d\n\nWhat led to Twitter fame?\n\nChen explains that she discovered her love for Twitter, now X, only after snagging her high-ranking crypto position.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy Twitter following began in crypto. I guess I wasn\u2019t really active on Twitter when I was a journalist because I was mainly covering the Asian market and reporting in Mandarin,\u201d says.\n\nChen has a very friendly-natured approach to X, explaining breaking events in broken-down, easy-to-understand threads for her followers.\n\nCurious about the Ripple case?\n\nLet's simplify:\n\n\u2022 It's a civil case\n\n\u2022 It's NOT criminal\n\n\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n\n\n\u2022 SEC's appeal needs approvals from courts.\n\n\u2022 Permission to appeal \u2260 guilt proven.\n\n\u2022 Judge Torres' ruling is current and declares Ripple innocent.\n\n\u2022 Successful\u2026 \u2014 Gracy Chen @Bitget (@GracyBitget) August 21, 2023\n\nHowever, she observes that her Twitter following surges during the same periods Bitget\u2019s business activity spikes.\n\n\u201cMy followers grew during a certain period of time, from the end of last year to earlier this year.

You\u2019ll get a glimpse into her jet-setting escapades, and who knows, you might even stumble upon some wild travel inspiration.\n\nBut when the crypto world goes haywire \u2014 whether it\u2019s lawsuits, exchanges going down or everything in between \u2014 Chen serves up honest breakdowns in bite-sized portions.\n\nWhat type of content do you like?\n\nChen has mixed feelings about Twitter, thinking it can sometimes become a raucous battleground.\n\n\u201cTwitter is basically a very noisy place. Everyone is changing their opinions and trying to be attention grabbers,\u201d Chen declares.\n\nYou open twitter and you see:\n\n\u2013 SEC suing this and that\n\n\u2013 rumors around projects\n\n\u2013 coins dropping in price\n\n\n\nFriendly reminder that Twitter isn't the real world.\n\n\n\nCrypto has made a ton of progress in 2023: \u2014 Gracy Chen @Bitget (@GracyBitget) June 12, 2023\n\nShe reveals that she enjoys seeing updates from Altcoin Daily and Coin Bureau, but she advises hardcore Crypto Twitter addicts to tear their eyes away from the screen every now and then.\n\n\u201cI would highly recommend anyone who is a heavy user of crypto information on Twitter to spend at least one hour or two away from social media and do fundamental research and talk to a group of trustworthy friends.\u201d\n\nPredictions\n\nChen firmly believes that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds are on the path to approval, though 2023 might not be the year it happens.\n\n\u201cNot this year \u2014 we only have three months left this year. Maybe early 2024,\u201d she predicts.\n\nShe hints that it could be a \u201cvery good driving force\u201d for the next bull market.\n\nA real Bitcoin ETF is coming soon.\n\n\n\nHere's how Grayscale's win against the SEC impacts you:\n\n/THREAD/ pic.twitter.com/wSxVzN5vdm \u2014 Gracy Chen @Bitget (@GracyBitget) September 1, 2023\n\nWhen it comes to Coinbase and Binance\u2019s showdown against the SEC, Chen suggests Coinbase might be in safe waters \u2014 but Binance could be in for a rollercoaster.\n\n\u201cI personally think that Coinbase is a pretty well-regulated, U.S.-driven crypto exchange, so the lawsuits might be settled by some fines. As for the SEC vs. Binance, it is much trickier.\u201d\n\nHowever, she is confident that Binance\u2019s legal warriors will put up a good fight:\n\n\u201cI think they have a very, very big and strong legal team to battle this fight.\u201d"

        "content": "Franklin Templeton entered the spot bitcoin ETF race on Tuesday, the most recent of the traditional Wall Street investment firms that are looking to sell digital asset products alongside more upstart companies.\n\nAccording to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF would be listed on the CBOE BZX Exchange. Crypto trading platform Coinbase would be the custodian. The proposed fund doesn\u2019t have a ticker symbol yet.\n\nFranklin Templeton has $13.1 billion in assets under management across 60 exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe firm\u2019s filing comes as more traditional financial firms move into cryptocurrency ETFs. Investment giants BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investment Co. have both filed for spot bitcoin ETFs, and many experts speculate that the SEC could give those firms priority if it approves the investment vehicles.\n\nWhile the SEC allows funds that track bitcoin futures contracts, such as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the agency has blocked and delayed proposals for ETFs that track physically backed bitcoin. The SEC has rejected more than 30 proposals for a spot bitcoin ETF since 2021, including those from Fidelity and VanEck and has blocked such funds since 2017 on the grounds that they are vulnerable to fraud and market manipulation.\n\nOn Aug. 29, however, cryptocurrency investment firm Grayscale Investments prevailed in a watershed legal victory over the SEC, when the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit ruled that the SEC must reconsider Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The SEC had previously rejected Grayscale\u2019s application. The ruling could mean that the SEC will eventually approve spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSEC Chairman Gensler: \u2018Crypto Rife With Fraud\u2019\n\nAs the SEC faces mounting pressure to approve more cryptocurrency ETFs, Chairman Gary Gensler hasn\u2019t backed down from his position that digital assets are an unsafe investment. At a Senate Banking Committee oversight hearing on Tuesday, Gensler said that cryptocurrency has \u201csignificant noncompliance\u201d problems and that the asset class as a whole is \u201crife with fraud, abuse and misconduct.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe SEC has 45 days to appeal the court\u2019s ruling in Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit, either in the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court. The agency could go as far as to roll back its approval of bitcoin futures ETFs if it doubles down on an anti-cryptocurrency stance.\n\nThe fund would be Franklin Templeton\u2019s first jump into digital asset ETFs. Its largest ETF is the Franklin U.S. Core Bond ETF (FLCB) with $1.6 billion in assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com. All rights reserved"

        "content": "What a difference a day makes, at least as far as cryptocurrencies go. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) made a startling recovery in the last 24 hours and turned around a large portion of its losses from yesterday. With that, a wide range of cryptocurrency stocks followed suit and saw shares climb to varying degrees throughout the day.\n\nAmong the winners was Greenidge Generation (NASDAQ:GREE), which saw its shares jump over 6% at one point in Tuesday\u2019s trading. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), known for its supply of over 150,000 Bitcoin, and Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), currently looking into a Bitcoin ETF, also gained modestly in today\u2019s trading. Posting fractional gains in Tuesday afternoon\u2019s trading, meanwhile, were crypto mainstays Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) and crypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN).\n\nFranklin Resources\u2019 play is actually unusual for a couple of reasons. The biggest one, not surprisingly, is that this is the first time Franklin Resources has ever tried to set up such an operation. Secondly, it\u2019s one of the first to make the play after certain legal headaches at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were finally taken down. The more such moves are made, the better overall crypto is likely to do; getting institutional money into cryptocurrency could trigger a gold rush bigger than any seen to date.\n\nGreenidge may have had the biggest gains, but it also has one of the lightest presences among analysts. It\u2019s rated a consensus Hold, but no analyst as yet has a price target on the stock. Meanwhile, Microstrategy, a Strong Buy, offers investors 45.97% upside potential thanks to its $508.25 average price target.\n\nDisclosure"

        "title": "NFTs vs. cryptocurrency: Key differences and how they work - TechTarget",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens are the two most popular applications that run on blockchain. While there is considerable overlap in how the two work, there are significant differences between them. The uses for cryptocurrency and NFTs also vary widely.\n\nCryptocurrency is an encrypted form of digital currency that relies on blockchain technology and doesn't depend on financial institutions to verify transactions. NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets that are stored on a blockchain and cannot be duplicated or cloned. Let's take a closer look at NFTs and cryptocurrency and examine their similarities and differences.\n\nWhat are NFTs? NFTs are unique digital assets that do not necessarily have a physical manifestation. They represent photos, music, videos, trading cards and other items. Nearly any digital asset, such as a collectible digital character, virtual real estate or original social media post, can be created and purchased as an NFT. Among the somewhat esoteric NFTs is one created by Jack Dorsey -- the original founder of Twitter -- of the first message ever sent on Twitter. NFTs are stored on distributed ledger technology, of which blockchain is a common type. The digital ledger lets NFTs be managed, bought and sold online. Every transaction on a blockchain is written to this digital ledger, which publicly records each NFT transaction to substantiate who owns the item. NFTs commonly have a value attached to them, which can be set by the creator, that can increase or decrease based on market demand. Blockchain technology makes the ledger essentially immutable, which means it usually can't be tampered with. This article is part of Blockchain for businesses: The ultimate enterprise guide Which also includes:\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of blockchain technology? 7 must-have blockchain developer skills Download 1 Download this entire guide for FREE now! The NFT creator keeps the copyright for the item and the right to copy it as many times as they want. Although the creator might create numerous copies of the original, if the buyer of the NFT wants to make copies, they must first get permission from the creator, and each copy is considered a unique NFT. NFTs are sold in collaboration with auction houses or in NFT marketplaces, such as the following: NBA Top Shot , an online marketplace that runs on the Flow blockchain where users can bid on, purchase and sell digital highlights of NBA players. An NBA Top Shot video featuring LeBron James honoring Kobe Bryant sold for close to $400,000.\n\n, an online marketplace that runs on the Flow blockchain where users can bid on, purchase and sell digital highlights of NBA players.

Venly, formerly known as Arkane Network, is a digital collectibles marketplace for general collectors and gamers -- Venly is based on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange and Ethereum and Polygon blockchains.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is an encrypted form of digital currency. Unlike traditional currency issued by governments, cryptocurrency doesn't rely on a government or financial institution for its creation or use. Cryptocurrency is typically stored in a crypto wallet and lets anyone send and receive payments. When an individual transfers cryptocurrency, the transactions are recorded in the immutable distributed ledger. Several organizations have issued their own cryptocurrencies -- often referred to as tokens -- which let people trade specifically for the product or service a company provides. An individual must exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency required to purchase the product or service. Examples of popular cryptocurrencies are the following: Bitcoin , a cryptocurrency created in 2009. People can buy and sell bitcoin using different currencies in marketplaces called bitcoin exchanges .\n\n, a cryptocurrency created in 2009.

These five steps show how blockchain works from transaction initiation to verification and delivery.\n\nHow are NFTs and cryptocurrency similar?

        "content": "It's becoming clear that investor apathy in this year's crypto market is starting to hurt Coinbase , according to Mizuho analysts. The crypto exchange's trading volume historically has been influenced by moves in the price of bitcoin . But that trend has been falling apart since the beginning of the year, Mizuho managing director Dan Dolev said in a note Tuesday, calling it a \"stark\" and \"likely unprecedented\" bifurcation. Dolev highlighted that while bitcoin has risen from its fourth-quarter 2022 trough to an average of $28,500 in the third quarter to date, Coinbase's trading volumes have tumbled, from $145 billion in the first quarter to $92 billion in the second and on pace for $80 billion in the third. \"This indicates potential fatigue among retail customers,\" Dolev said. \"Unlike in prior cycles, FOMO no longer entices investors to trade bitcoin when prices rise the way it did in prior years. This could prove problematic for COIN.\" \"With retail accounting for 95% of trading revenue, we worry that the YTD rise in COIN's stock is unsustainable,\" he added. \"We expect a reality check to follow.\" Mizuho maintains its underperform rating and $27 price target on Coinbase shares. Dolev also said the spike in daily volumes that followed Grayscale's big win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 30 has faded, with September average daily trading volumes tracking below August levels by some 25%. Bitcoin trading volume across spot crypto exchanges is about in line with levels from Aug. 30, according to CryptoQuant. The price of bitcoin has remained stagnant in recent weeks despite having several positive developments during the same period on the regulatory and exchange-traded funds fronts. Those rallies have failed to hold, however, as the market suffers from low liquidity and volume. Others on Wall Street have said the next cycle in crypto will be led by institutions rather than retail investors and could be slower to take off as the industry and policymakers lay the appropriate groundwork for them. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Spot Bitcoin ETFs haven\u2019t even been approved in the US, and yet already some see them as an existential threat to the futures-based funds that came before them.\n\nBlackRock Inc. leads a group of firms awaiting word from regulators on their filings to launch what would be the first US ETFs linked to the spot price of the largest cryptocurrency. Grayscale Investments is also in the mix after scoring a legal victory in its quest to convert its $16 billion Bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund. Proponents are optimistic that the heft of the issuers involved and Grayscale\u2019s recent court win may finally tilt the odds in favor of these funds being approved.\n\nRelated: Court Paves Way for Spot Bitcoin ETF in Grayscale Ruling\n\nAs of now, the closest US fund investors can come to investing in the cryptocurrency is through products that track Bitcoin futures contracts. When these funds debuted in October 2021, their coming out broke records \u2014 but they weren\u2019t able to sustain that same level of excitement for long, and their combined market value has since leveled off at about $1 billion. The arrival of spot-based funds \u2014 which analysts say would track the price of the coin more closely and at a potentially lower cost \u2014 may threaten even that toehold.\n\n\u201cWe would expect the assets and volume to coalesce around one or multiple spot-Bitcoin ETFs because they are superior products for most types of investors,\u201d said James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cNew money, particularly those looking to buy and hold over longer time periods, will be attracted to a spot product, which is also likely to be cheaper and more efficient than the current futures ETFs on US exchanges.\u201d\n\nRelated: Crypto Enthusiasts Stoked by Bitcoin-ETF Hype Shrug Off Ether-Fund Push\n\nIf approved, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market has the potential to grow into a $100 billion juggernaut in time, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.\n\nBitcoin-futures ETFs, of which the roughly $914 million ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (ticker BITO) is by far the largest, received a warm welcome because their approval marked a watershed moment for the crypto industry. After a years-long fight for such funds in the US, issuers were finally able to entice investors with a product that offered easier exposure to the digital-assets market.\n\nBut the funds have trailed Bitcoin\u2019s rally this year. The lag can, at least partly, be explained by which specific futures contracts the ETFs hold, and the expense associated with rolling them over as they expire, BI\u2019s Seyffart has found.

Fee wars are a familiar phenomenon in the increasingly crowded ETF arena \u2014 both in new categories as well as established asset classes \u2014 and many are expecting fierce competition between different issuers should Bitcoin ETFs launch.\n\n\u201cIf investors are faced with the choice of spot versus futures, they will likely always go with a spot ETF unless they\u2019re specifically looking for a leveraged or inverse product,\u201d said Roxanna Islam, associate director of research at VettaFi. \u201cSpot ETFs will have to come out with lower fees to remain competitive. This could be even more significant if we see a mass approval of spot ETF products where a lower fee could be what differentiates an ETF from its peers.\u201d\n\nWhichever way the rivalry among new issuers shakes out, they may not leave much room for anyone else.\n\n--With assistance from Sam Potter."

        "title": "$500 Million in Bitcoin Thrown Out With the Trash, Still the Strangest Crypto Tale Ever - autoevolution",
        "content": "Strange times bring forth the strangest stories, but few could hold a candle to this one. In the early days of the crypto market, one man mined thousands of Bitcoin \u2013 and then threw the hard drive with it into the trash.\n\nPhoto: BBC\n\nA tale not as old as time but as strange as the crypto bubble\n\nPhoto: Impossible_Ad_9325 / Reddit\n\nCouncil takes door number three\n\nPhoto: YouTube/Boston Dynamics\n\nIf you think viral pieces about someone losing the money for a new house in a national crypto scam are strange, you haven't heard nothing yet. That honor arguably goes to James Howells, a former IT professional from Newport, Wales \u2013 the multi-millionaire whose fortune lies in the local landfill, under tons of trash, and who just got denied (again!) from digging it up.For the past couple of years, Howells has been putting together an international team of experts, both in the field of data recovery and lost item recovery, after securing backing from two major investors. He's also been working on three approaches to the unique search and rescue mission, two of which required being granted access to the landfill by the Newport Council.His appeals have fallen on deaf ears once more, a local publication reports . Howells' appeal and his two plans have been denied on the same grounds as his previous appeals were shut down: there is no guarantee that the hard drive is at the location, the environmental risks for digging the landfill up are too great, and the operation would be a waste of council money.In the early days of the crypto market, Howells used to mine for Bitcoin out of the office in the home where he still lives today. He eventually had 7,500 Bitcoin (or 8,000, depending on which of his accounts you take into consideration) on a laptop hard drive. He placed the drive in a drawer after spilling lemonade on it, with the intention of recovering whatever was on it after it had dried.He never did because he forgot about it, just like he forgot about the Bitcoin. He ended up putting the drive in the garbage when he cleared out the room in 2013. He says he remembered the Bitcoin after he'd gone to bed, making a mental note to recover it from the trash before he took the bag to the bin.Howells' wife (now ex) woke up first, got ready for work, and took the garbage out on her way out. Howells says that he doesn't blame her for inadvertently throwing out his fortune, but they've since divorced. He's also spent the last decade trying to convince the council to allow him to dig around the landfill.And with good reason: whether you consider the crypto market the digital future or the biggest scam of modern times, there's no denying the fact that real money comes out of it. When Howells accidentally threw the drive into the trash bag, the Bitcoin on it was worth a few thousand dollars. At the peak of the crypto market, its value shot up to more than $500 million but has since dwindled to \"just\u201d $216 million as of August 2023.When we last covered Howells' strange case, he'd gathered a huge team of experts, including specialists from Ontrack, which previously assisted NASA with recovering the drive on the Columbia space shuttle that crashed on Earth in 2003, environmental specialists, and even former council workers.His number 1 plan was to concentrate his efforts on an area of the landfill measuring about 200 square meters (2,153 square feet) and 15 meters (49 feet) deep. The team would use a couple of Boston Dynamics robot dogs , landfill excavation, AI-powered sorting, and waste management to recover the drive, and Ontrack would do the rest, recovering the data on it \u2013 assuming it wasn't cracked \"in a million pieces.\"The Bitcoin fortune would then be divided into three: Howells would keep a chunk, his team would get the other, and the third would go to the council, the community, and a variety of environmental organizations. As Howells saw it, it was an everybody-wins-type of situation.Plan number 2 was the same, except it would extend to the entire landfill , so it would take as much as 3 years and a lot more money. Plan number 3 was to sue the council and force its hand. The council has clearly chosen door number 3, so they can kiss the 1/3 of the money Howells had promised goodbye.Howells says he's now put together a legal team, and they've sent the council a final warning: they have until September 18 to grant Howells access, or the matter is going to court. Howells argues that, since the hard drive left his home without his consent, it's technically theft of private property, so the council is an accomplice to theft by denying him the chance to recover it.As a slightly funnier aside, Howells says he has been unemployed all these years because he needed to focus on his rescue operation exclusively. Plus, he has no reason to work for someone else when he has $216 million buried in the ground. He swears he has no regrets about the incident but is actually proud of being an early crypto adopter Sometimes, looking at the brighter side of things reallythe only option.A spokesperson for the council says that they have no intention of reconsidering their original decision, which they communicated to Howells in 2013 and repeated several times already. Moreover, they won't be talking to the media anymore concerning the case because it's too much of a waste of time and public money."

        "title": "How to cash out your Bitcoin safely - Business Insider Africa",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s demand has increased dramatically. So, if you\u2019ve held onto your Bitcoin for some time, you can sell it for a profit. You may also trade Bitcoin and invest your money into something else. Regardless of your decision, you may want to know the safest way.\n\nMost people know Bitcoin as a digital currency. It doesn\u2019t exist physically but digital data in the blockchain. Blockchain technology makes Bitcoin secure; no central authority or government controls it. Its protocol limits the number of digital coins that will ever exist to 21 million tokens. This supply limit gives Bitcoin its value.\n\nAs miners near the supply limit, Bitcoin demand increases. That means you can sell the Bitcoins you bought a decade ago at a higher price. Most people purchase Bitcoin on platforms like Immediate Momentum. These allow individuals to sign up and use fiat money to buy Bitcoin. But how do you cash out your Bitcoin? Here\u2019s how to convert Bitcoin into cash.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrypto Exchange\n\nYou can quickly sell your Bitcoins via a crypto exchange. Crypto exchanges are digital platforms that bring together cryptocurrency buyers and sellers. Some specialize in Bitcoin, but others accept various cryptocurrencies. Using these platforms to cash out Bitcoin is straightforward. Register and load Bitcoins from your wallet into your crypto exchange account. After that, place a sell order to convert Bitcoins into cash. Send the funds to the bank account you used to register once you sell Bitcoins.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Trade\n\nDirect trade is also another option for cashing out Bitcoin. And this involves selling Bitcoins to somebody else via another entity. Online peer-to-peer platforms allow sellers to get offers from willing buyers. You will agree on the fiat currency the buyer will use to pay for the Bitcoins. A crypto exchange often facilitates these transactions. Once you decide to trade, the online platform will escrow your Bitcoins and release them after you confirm receiving the fiat money you agreed with the buyer.\n\nFace-to-Face Transaction\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou can also sell your Bitcoin at your preferred in-person location. For instance, you may find a family member or friend that wants to buy Bitcoin. However, this method requires knowledge of crypto wallets and how to transfer Bitcoins to another person.\n\nAlso, research is vital when using this method because Bitcoin\u2019s value fluctuates rapidly. Therefore, know this cryptocurrency\u2019s value when selling it. Nevertheless, you can use the current rates on a prominent crypto exchange to determine the price to sell your Bitcoin.\n\nSome places have physical shops or locations where you can sell Bitcoins. Nevertheless, be cautious when using this method to cash out Bitcoin to ensure you receive payment for your cryptocurrency. Release your Bitcoins only after receiving fiat money, especially when selling your crypto asset to a stranger.\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs enable cryptocurrency users to access their cash immediately using the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin ATMs operate differently from traditional ATMs because they require you to scan a QR code to sell Bitcoin and receive payment in fiat cash. You can use the internet to find a Bitcoin ATM near you. However, prepare to pay a higher transaction fee if you use this method to cash out your Bitcoins. Also, some Bitcoin ATMs allow users to buy Bitcoin but not sell it. Others allow only users with existing accounts to use them to trade Bitcoins, and the registration process takes time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFinal Word\n\nYou can cash out your Bitcoin in various ways. Crypto exchanges provide the most popular way to sell Bitcoin and receive fiat cash payments. Nevertheless, choose a well-known and reliable Bitcoin exchange to ensure you receive your funds after selling Bitcoin.\n\n--"

        "title": "Bitcoin data highlights 3 key reasons why investors don't care about BTC price - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Much has been made of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) poor price action as of late, with many analysts making the case for further bearish momentum in the weeks ahead.\n\nYet it wasn\u2019t too long ago that many investors and crypto pundits were raving about some noteworthy fundamental metrics that were, and continue to be, quite bullish.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at three Bitcoin metrics that bulls might keep in mind.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate hovers near a record high\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate, a metric showing the amount of computing power dedicated to mining BTC, recently hit a record high, indicating the overall strength of the network and continued interest from miners. There has never been more security in Bitcoin, and it highlights the fact that miners appear to have faith in the future of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThere\u2019s some controversy as to whether or not a high hash rate constitutes a bullish signal. Investors equate the increased hashing power as a sign of an impending price increase, while others say the opposite, or that no correlation exists at all.\n\nWhen looking at the past year\u2019s data, there does appear to be a distinct relationship between hash rate and price.\n\nBitcoin total hash rate vs. market price (USD), 1-year chart. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nThis makes perfect sense, given that miners will eventually begin to mine more when prices rise. The hash rate and miners\u2019 actions are also impacted by the Bitcoin difficulty adjustment that occurs roughly every two weeks. As the hash rate rises, so does the difficulty, meaning it requires more energy to mine 1 BTC.\n\nA higher hash rate can only sustain lower prices for so long because miners\u2019 cost of production increases with difficulty, while their profits diminish. Therefore, either the price must rise or the hash rate will fall at some point.\n\nCurrently, the price has fallen significantly relative to the hash rate. The last time this happened in June, a rally followed.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners need BTC price over $98K by the halving \u2014 Analysis\n\nIn addition to the hash rate rising, there appears to be renewed mining interest from nation-states. The country of Oman has announced plans to produce 7% of the Bitcoin hash rate less than two years from now.\n\nJUST IN: Oman plans to produce 7% of the global #Bitcoin hash rate by June 2025! pic.twitter.com/HOJDlCcyBU \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) September 10, 2023\n\nBitcoin addresses holding 0.1 BTC at all-time high\n\nBitcoin hodlers have remained strong throughout the bear market, with the number of wallets holding 0.1 BTC or more reaching 12 million for the first time. This trend has continued despite the current range-bound price action dotted with occasional corrections.\n\nBitcoin addresses with balance of over 0.01 BTC vs. price. Source: Look Into Bitcoin\n\nThis demonstrates a degree of trust in the asset class in spite of everything else happening in the market. Adoption is growing even as prices disappoint.\n\nWhile 0.1 BTC may have once been a trivial amount, today it\u2019s significant, as this represents about $2,500 at current prices. The fiat value can be much higher when priced in other currencies. 12 million entities having amassed this much Bitcoin shows how seriously the world has begun to take such an investment.\n\nBitcoin balances held on exchanges trend down\n\nThe number of wallets holding significant amounts of Bitcoin has also risen, while the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges has been trending lower since the collapse of FTX in November 2022. This trend has ramped up since April 2023. This indicates that individuals are taking self-custody of their coins, possibly highlighting their disinterest in selling in the near future.\n\nBTC price vs balance held on exchanges one-year chart. Source: Coinglass\n\nOver the last week, the BTC balance held on exchanges has declined from 1.88 million to 1.84 million. Historically, an influx of coins to exchanges has tended to precede a time of selling pressure, while outflows from exchanges have buoyed the Bitcoin price.\n\nTaken together, these three metrics show that investors\u2019 thesis for buying Bitcoin has grown stronger than ever. Bitcoin miners keep mining, hodlers keep hodling, and individuals continue to take custody of their coins.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Their proposed ETF, if approved, would provide investors with a more accessible and regulated means to gain exposure to the world's leading cryptocurrency.\n\nThe filing outlines plans for the Franklin Templeton Digital Asset Trust, which aims to track the performance of Bitcoin.\n\nSeveral other investment firms have submitted similar applications in recent years, but none have yet received SEC approval.\n\nStill, over the past few years, Bitcoin has garnered attention as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, driving institutions to diversify their portfolios.\n\nIn their filing, Franklin Templeton highlighted the benefits of a Bitcoin ETF, such as improved liquidity and ease of trading for investors, without the need for them to directly hold and manage cryptocurrency assets. This approach is expected to be more appealing to conservative investors who are still hesitant about the complexities of Bitcoin custody and security.\n\nHowever, the road to launching a Bitcoin ETF in the United States has been a challenging one, with the SEC consistently emphasizing the need for robust investor protections and market surveillance. Franklin Templeton's application will be subject to a thorough regulatory review, which could take several months before a final decision is reached.\n\nIf approved, the Franklin Templeton Digital Asset Trust would join the growing list of cryptocurrency ETFs available to U.S. investors, including the many Bitcoin Futures ETFs now live on various ex\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies witnessed a fall on Tuesday amid gains in the greenback. Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $25,729, down 0.53% while Ethereum (ETH), Tether USDt, BNB , USD Coin, XRP Dogecoin, Cardano and Solana fell up to 2%.ETH was trading at $1,580.67 while Dogecoin was at $0.06124.\"In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin briefly lost its crucial support at $25,000 for the first time in almost three months. For BTC to not enter panic mode, $24,500 support remains sacrosanct. This is the level above which BTC has been trading for almost 6 months now. As for ETH, which fell 2.8%, the support of $1,600 has been breached and it is currently trading around $1,550,\" Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk said.In Hudda's opinion, a major catalyst for SOL\u2019s ($17.95) sell-off is still Wednesday's expectation of FTX unlock, pointing out that this cryptocurrency was already down by around 50% from its recent high in July. \"Additionally, given that a majority of the SOL is time-locked for FTX, we could very well see a 'sell the rumor, buy the news\u2019 event playing out on Tuesday,\" he added.Prospects of cryptocurrency, which has an inverse relationship with the US dollar, will be hinging upon the movement in the USD as investors in different asset classes await US CPI Data slated for release today, along with the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data and the retail sales data which is expected to be published on Thursday.Among the top-performing cryptocurrencies, MKR leads with a remarkable gain of 120%, followed by OMG with 35%, ZIL with 26% and MATIC with 15%. The biggest losers include ENS with a significant drop of 69%, WAVES with 64%, COTI with 38%, GNS with 28% and REP with 26%.\"The 'Three Black Crows' candlestick pattern on the 4-hour time frame signals a continuation of the bearish trend. Bitcoin is currently in oversold territory with indicators such as the RSI below 30 indicating an exhaustion of sellers, which may lead to a brief bullish correction before another downtrend. MACD is also in a sell zone with bearish histograms below zero,\" Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin said.Vishwanath said that the Bitcoin price was currently below the 50-day EMA at $25,500, reinforcing bearish sentiment and BTC could face resistance around $25,400 and a small bullish correction to $25,600 may precede a deeper decline towards $24,800. \"The descending trend line at $25,600 is a significant barrier, but an upside breakout could push Bitcoin to $26,400 or even $46,000,\" he added.A break below $24,800 could lead to support at $24,000 the Unocoin CEO said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "The bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, FTX has unveiled assets worth USD $7 billion and billions of dollars in payments made to senior executives, including its Founder, Sam Bankman-Fried. FTX\u2019s financial disclosure, made in a court filing on Monday, preceded Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial which is expected next month.\n\nAccording to the court document, the company\u2019s assets comprise a mix of cryptocurrencies and real estate holdings. Notably, these assets include a substantial USD $1.16 billion in Solana (SOL) tokens, USD $560 million in Bitcoin (BTC), and USD $200 million worth of real estate holdings in the Bahamas.\n\nFTX\u2019s Controversial Executive Payout\n\nOne of the most contentious aspects of FTX\u2019s financial revelation is the disclosure of substantial payments to senior executives in the months preceding the bankruptcy Bankruptcy Bankruptcy or insolvency constitutes a legal term and refers to being unable to repay debts. A business and a person can declare bankruptcy. When a person or company claims bankruptcy, it is described as a voluntary bankruptcy, and when your debtors force you into bankruptcy, it is referred to as involuntary.

Founder Bankman-Fried, along with other executives like Nishad Singh, Gary Wang, and Caroline Ellison, allegedly received a staggering USD $2.2 billion in cash, crypto, equity, and real estate.\n\nBesides the digital assets holdings, the court document reveals the company\u2019s extensive real estate portfolio comprising 38 condos, penthouses, and other properties. The fate of these properties, like the rest of FTX\u2019s assets, remains uncertain amid the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nUnder the leadership of the new CEO, John Ray III, FTX has embarked on a mission to reclaim funds previously donated to politicians and charitable organizations. These efforts include endeavouring to recover donations made to institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which has decided to return USD $550,000.\n\nBesides that, FTX is pursuing payments made to high-profile athletes and sports teams as celebrity endorsements. According to a report by Finance Magnates, one of these payments includes the sought-after funds of $750,000 made to the former basketball professional Shaquille O\u2019Neal.\n\nFTX Pursue Payments Made to Celebrities\n\nAdditionally, FTX is seeking to recoup more than USD $300,000 and $270,000 paid to the Tennis player Naomi Osaka and the former basketball star David Ortiz, respectively. Many of these celebrities are facing class action lawsuits filed by former FTX's customers whose funds are now caught up in the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nBesides that, FTX has taken legal action against LayerZero Labs, a cross-chain protocol, seeking the recovery of an investment of $21 million. FTX claims that LayerZero withdrew the funds illegally before FTX collapsed despite being aware of the exchange\u2019s liquidity crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryan Salame, the former Co-CEO of FTX\u2019s Bahamian subsidiary and a close associate of Bankman-Fried, entered a guilty plea last week for making tens of millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations. As part of his plea, Salame has agreed to forfeit more than USD $1.5 billion."

        "content": "It is now two years after El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. Since September 7 2021, when the daring decision was made by President Nayib Bukele\u2019s government, numerous events of significance have transpired.\n\nThe Terra Luna ecosystem has crashed, the FTX debacle has occurred and on a more positive note, an African country, Central African Republic (CAR) sort of followed El Salvador\u2019s trajectory in 2022.\n\nRelated post: Central African Republic launches official crypto, Sango Coin\n\nHowever, has the El Salvador Bitcoin Law bettered the livelihood of its citizens? Are the pros more than the cons? Is it advisable for other countries to toe El Salvador\u2019s path? Let\u2019s have a look.\n\nThe state of Bitcoin as El Salvador\u2019s legal currency\n\nThe landmark decision, championed by President Nayib Bukele\u2019s government, demonstrated the trust vested in Bitcoin and it was well received by crypto enthusiasts at the time.\n\nHowever, two years down the line, trends have shown that the decision by the ambitious president might not be going as planned. Integrating Bitcoin into daily life has presented numerous challenges to El Salvadorians.\n\nFirstly, like almost every other developing country, cash is still king in El Salvador and almost 70% of its population is unbanked. Also, assessments say the Bitcoin transition leaves behind those who do not have a smartphone (predominantly older Salvadorans) and those without internet access.\n\n\n\nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele delivers his annual address to the nation marking his second year in office at the Legislative Assembly in San Salvador on June 1, 2021. (Photo by MARVIN RECINOS / AFP) (Photo by MARVIN RECINOS/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAdditionally, it can be found out that the project was not well thought out before it was implemented because many Salvadorans were clueless about Bitcoin before it was found out their country planned to make it legal tender. A poll of around 1,300 Salvadorans by the Central American University leading up to the rollout showed only about 10% of respondents fully understood cryptocurrency.\n\nRead also: Central African Republic (CAR) creates a 15-member committee to draft crypto bill\n\nAlso, it was discovered that many citizens just downloaded the Chivo Wallet App, spent the $30 bitcoin incentives and ditched the app, and bitcoin usage altogether.\n\nNayib Bukele takes pride in purchasing Bitcoin with government funds. To date, the government has acquired over 2,000 bitcoins. But since reaching a high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, the price of a single bitcoin has fallen, reducing the value of the country\u2019s Bitcoin holdings by over 60%.\n\nShould any country make Bitcoin a legal tender at this point?\n\nAs a nascent and speculative asset, it is not advisable for a country to embark on the experimental journey that El Salvador is attempting, at least for now.\n\nCentral Africa Republic, in April 2022 sort of followed the Central American country\u2019s footprint, although theirs was much on its proposed blockchain-based Sango Project. The reception in the African country has not been positive and no development of significance has been heard of the project recently.\n\nAlso, economists have speculated on a link between the El Salvador Bitcoin bonds and its debt crisis. This put the country in a terrible fix because the country has been chided by the International Monetary Fund which has constantly told Nayib Bukele to discard Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nWhat could be deduced from the whole scenario is that Bitcoin City plans, the Sango Project and other \u2018revolutionary ideas\u2019 being embarked on are too utopian, especially for developing countries in Africa.\n\n\n\nTop court in Central African Republic (CAR) rules against crypto purchase of e-residency, land and citizenship\n\nCAR aims to create a crypto island and a citizenship scheme based on cryptocurrency investment while the majority of its citizens still lack access to basic infrastructural developments like electricity, internet and smartphones.\n\nAlso, with major financial institutions like the IMF at odds with Bitcoin, making that move would complicate relationships with regional and international agencies. With this, it is important to consider the challenges attached before embarking on a project that might eventually end up as a bubble, affecting the lives of millions, in the process.\n\nLastly\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s decision to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender is a historic moment in finance. It demonstrates the nation\u2019s boldness in embracing innovation for the benefit of its citizens. Even though the country faces numerous challenges, its commitment to Bitcoin remains steadfast and could be applauded."

        "title": "How Bitcoin is boosting financial inclusion & empowering the unbanked - Business Insider Africa",
        "content": "Many people, especially in developing countries, face many challenges when accessing financial services. Unfortunately, the inability to access financial services and loans hinder them from participating in economic activities. The World Bank's 2017 report indicated that 1.7 billion adults are unbanked globally. These individuals need access to financial services like credit and savings accounts to start and grow businesses.\n\nThis report showed that 56% of the unbanked adults are in China, Bangladesh, Mexico, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Limited financial literacy, strict regulations, inadequate infrastructure, and poverty are some of the reasons for financial exclusion. Unfortunately, most unbanked people use risky, expensive, and unreliable financial services.\n\nHow Bitcoin Boosts Financial Inclusion to Empower the Unbanked\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin, they had this notion in mind. They knew that accessing and using financial services reduces poverty while enhancing economic growth. While Bitcoin dominates the crypto world, other digital currencies have emerged. Some are even products of various countries' central banks. For instance, you can invest and try luck in oil trading with online trading apps like Oil Profit. Nevertheless, many see Bitcoin as the beacon of hope for those with limited access to financial services. Here's why.\n\nEasy Access\n\nBitcoin allows individuals to access and use financial services from their mobile devices. To set up a crypto wallet and start receiving Bitcoin, you require a Smartphone that connects to the internet. That way, you can receive Bitcoin payments and transfer them. Also, you can join crypto exchanges to trade Bitcoin for profits.\n\nCurrently, several decentralized finance platforms provide various services to the unbanked. For instance, you can use these platforms to save money and access loans and insurance without the restrictions of traditional banks.\n\nFaster and Low-Cost Transactions\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nConventional financial institutions charge high fees for most transactions, including international remittances. Bitcoin does not require intermediaries because transactions are peer-to-peer, reducing costs significantly. When El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender, citizens' remittance costs dropped by 65%. Thus, even small businesses can lower transaction costs by embracing Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nBesides, Bitcoin transactions are faster because they do not involve intermediaries. Miners validate Bitcoin transactions within minutes. Thus, merchants can receive payments faster and invest funds in their operations by embracing this cryptocurrency.\n\nBorderless Transactions\n\nBitcoin's decentralized network facilitates cross-border transactions without intermediaries. This cryptocurrency enables individuals to transfer and receive funds globally without traditional bank accounts. And this is particularly beneficial for individuals in places with limited conventional banking infrastructure and migrants.\n\nFinancial Empowerment\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto wanted people to enjoy total control over their finances. This cryptocurrency can act as your bank. And you can access it anytime, anywhere. And this is particularly vital for people in places with economic and political instability or limited banking access. Bitcoin enables you to preserve wealth, enjoy financial autonomy, and protect your investment against inflation.\n\nEntrepreneurship Opportunities\n\nThe unbanked population can access the global economy by embracing Bitcoin. This digital currency enables individuals to engage in digital entrepreneurship by fostering the creation and growth of new business models. And this promotes economic growth by creating opportunities that individuals can exploit and boost their livelihoods.\n\nFinal Word\n\nBitcoin is a beacon of hope for the unbanked populations in many countries. It promotes financial inclusion by enabling borderless transactions, enhancing access to financial services, empowering people with financial autonomy, and reducing transaction costs. If the unbanked population embraces Bitcoin, it can exploit the opportunities that Bitcoin presents and achieve economic empowerment by participating in global economic activities. Nevertheless, understanding how this virtual currency works and the economic growth opportunities it presents is vital for unbanked and financially excluded people to benefit from it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n--"

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Confirms Double Top, How Low Can BTC Drop? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Yesterday\u2019s weekly close of the Bitcoin price below the $26,000 mark has raised concerns among analysts and traders. This move could potentially signal a further decline for the leading cryptocurrency, as it appears to be the first step to confirming a double top formation on the weekly chart.\n\nRekt Capital, a prominent figure in the crypto analysis sphere, took to Twitter to share his insights, stating, \u201cBTC has officially Weekly Closed below the ~$26,000 support. Technically, BTC has begun the first step in the process of validating this Double Top formation. Turn $26,000 into new resistance and the breakdown will likely be confirmed.\u201d\n\nHow Low Can The Bitcoin Price Drop?\n\nRemarkably, this isn\u2019t the first time Rekt Capital has voiced concerns about this price level. Already on August 7, the analyst warned, \u201cIf BTC drops to $26,000 by mid-September then a Double Top may be forming. A breakdown from $26,000 would validate the Double Top.\u201d\n\nDiving deeper into potential price movements, Rekt Capital has speculated that a breach of the $26,000 base could see Bitcoin tumble towards the $22,000 region. The analyst emphasized the importance of observing the price action this week, noting, \u201cif we see a weekly close below $26,000, followed by a rejection from $26,000, then we probably see a confirmed breakdown from this double top.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all gloom and doom. Rekt Capital also highlighted the dangers of getting overly bearish, advising traders, \u201cSo it\u2019s really important not to get caught in these downside wicks (below $26,000).\u201d On a brighter note, the analyst pointed to the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Bitcoin\u2019s weekly chart which played out in mid-March this year, suggesting that a retest of its neckline, around $24,000, might indicate the bottom of Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming move.\n\nDecentrader, a crypto intelligence platform, weighed in on the current market conditions, tweeting, \u201cThe market is currently experiencing the most sustained period of #bitcoin on-chain losses since the bear market lows. Is this a buy the dip opportunity or the start of a deeper pullback?\u201d\n\nThey further highlighted potential price movements, stating, \u201cBitcoin Liquidity Map: There is a significant amount of 3x, 5x, 10x liquidity from $23,500 down to $21,600. IF price did get down to $23,500 we could see a fairly swift liquidity escalation event that could move price down fast.\u201d\n\nFinal Correction?\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe, another esteemed analyst, provided a comprehensive historical perspective. He emphasized the significance of September as a historically challenging month for Bitcoin, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s a level which #Bitcoin must hold in order to avoid a significant crash. Bitcoin is currently holding onto a significant level of support. It\u2019s around the $25,500 barrier.\u201d\n\nVan de Poppe delved into the historical and cyclical aspects of Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. He highlights that the months of August and September, especially in a pre-halving year, have traditionally been tough for Bitcoin. In August 2015, Bitcoin experienced a substantial correction towards the 200-EMA but managed to stay above it. A similar pattern was observed in August 2019, with a significant correction followed by a smaller one in November 2019.\n\nDrawing parallels between the current market cycle and that of 2015, van de Poppe suggested that given the influx of new institutional participants, the current market could be mirroring the 2015 cycle. If this correlation holds, the current downturn could be the final correction before a potential rebound.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $25,692.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nEven as he pushes to get the world past \"the fax era of global payments,\" Bitcoin bull David Marcus said he doesn't believe that BTC will ever become a popular or common payment method.\n\n\u201cOur view is actually that Bitcoin is not the currency that people will use to buy things,\" the entrepreneur said during an interview with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Monday.\n\nThe comment may seem surprising coming from Marcus, who co-founded PayPal and now serves as the CEO of Lightspark\u2014a company building on Bitcoin\u2019s lightning network. But it is on that network\u2014a layer-2 scaling solution on top of the top cryptocurrency\u2014where he is placing his bets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We're trying to turn #Bitcoin into a global payment network. There's no universal protocol for money on the internet that enables value to be transported,\" says @lightspark CEO @davidmarcus. \"Our view is $BTC is not the currency people will use to buy things.\" pic.twitter.com/3fEBTzHxJS \u2014 Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) September 11, 2023\n\nThe lightning network is intended to make Bitcoin transactions faster, cheaper, and more practical for small payments. It processes BTC transactions separately before later settling them on the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to Marcus, the company\u2019s goal is to turn lightning into a \u201cuniversal protocol for money on the internet,\u201d similar to how texting is a universal protocol for communication. However, the currencies transferred over the network would still be the fiat currencies we know and use today.\n\n\u201cA fragment of a Bitcoin on top of lightning is like a small packet data packet on the internet only for value,\u201d said Marcus. Users could send any currency they\u2019d like\u2014including dollars, yen, or euros\u2014and receive any money of choice on the other side. Lightning acts as the \u201creal-time,\u201d \u201clow cost,\u201d and \u201ccash final\u201d settlement layer in between, he explained.\n\nMarcus did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe executive\u2019s views echo that of Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, whose company also leverages lightning for cheaper global currency transfers. The wallet app now enables worldwide lightning-based remittances to 65 countries like Argentina, Nigeria, and Ghana, where users can receive transactions as local currency within their bank account.\n\nBefore working on Bitcoin, Marcus worked on Meta\u2019s now-defunct stablecoin wallet app, NOVI. Between failed partnerships and backlash from regulators, Marcus stepped down from the firm in late November 2021, saying his \u201centrepreneurial DNA\u201d was encouraging him to move on. He launched Lightspark six months later.\n\nFellow PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel also speaks well of Bitcoin, considering it an alternative to today's \u201cbankrupt\u201d central banks and \u201cfiat money regime.\"\n\nAs a company, PayPal now allows users to buy, sell, and hold crypto, including Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC). Last month, the payment platform announced its own stablecoin, PYUSD, which means to \u201ctransform payments in Web3 and digitally native environments.\u201d"

        "content": "Fraudulent and scam cases are becoming more prevalent in India. We occasionally hear tales of people who have had their money stolen from them. The easiest way to prevent being a victim of such scams is to be wary of strangers and do extensive background checks on everyone you speak to online. Furthermore, one should exercise extreme caution while investing money and should not do it merely on the advice of others or on the promise of high returns. Financial advice from strangers can frequently have rather disastrous outcomes.\n\nAn Ahmedabad-based software engineer who met a woman through a dating website and followed her suggestion to spend close to \u20b91 crore in Bitcoin experienced a similar situation. The techie lost all of his money since the woman turned out to be a con artist.\n\nSoftware engineer loses more than \u20b9 1 crore\n\nA software programmer lost \u20b91 crore because a woman he met on a marriage website betrayed him. Fraud was committed against an Ahmedabad-based software engineer. He fell for a cryptocurrency fraud. He claimed to have lost \u20b91 crore as a victim of fraud in his police complaint to Gandhinagar. The victim of fraud was Kuldeep Patel.\n\nAditi was a young woman whom Kuldeep met online while searching for probable matches. He learned from the woman that she exports goods to the United Kingdom. Kuldeep was given the advice to make a deposit at Banocoin by the woman. Kuldeep did so by making a bank deposit of the funds.\n\nA $78 profit was seen on the initial investment of one lakh. As a result, he began making larger investments. Deposits of \u20b91.34 crore were made between July 20 and August 31. On September 3, he attempted to withdraw \u20b92.59 lakh but was told the account had been frozen.\n\nKuldeep was instructed that he must deposit an additional \u20b935 lakh in order to regain access to the account. Later, Kuldeep attempted to get in touch with the visitor he had met on the marriage website but was unsuccessful. This is how he came to the realisation that he was a fraud victim.\n\nWays to stay secure\n\nAvoiding giving your hard-earned money to strangers is the best way to protect yourself from such frauds. There are many reputable financial investors available that are equipped to assist you with your investments. If you are unclear about what investments you should make, it is advisable to speak with professionals rather than believing strangers.\n\nAdditionally, scammers are increasingly targeting people through dating and marriage apps. Therefore, even if you want to trust someone you met on such an app, make sure to meet them a few times first and get to know them as well as you can before you truly trust them.\n\nMilestone Alert!

They allow users to add features and functionality from independent developers. This could include custom user interfaces, notifications, and insights into transactions to spot malicious contracts.\n\nAs of now, users can choose from 34 different Snaps, including encrypted password managers, risk detectors, and wallet-to-wallet chat, among others.\n\n\u201cThe most important part of the Snaps story to me is that we now have a system at the heart of our wallet that allows us to step back and humbly invite the community to provide their own solutions to the hardest problems,\u201d said Dan Finlay, Co-founder of MetaMask.\n\nIn a move to foster innovation, Consensys is opening up Snaps\u2019 development so that any developer can build a feature for MetaMask and retain ownership of their code. Currently, each Snap must pass a security audit and gain a whitelist status from the MetaMask team. However, MetaMask plans to change to a permissionless approach in the future, where developers can list Snaps without approval."

        "content": "Many people are rushing to invest in Bitcoin, thinking it will lead to quick riches. The internet has lured many people into crypto investments with stories of Bitcoin millionaires. But is Bitcoin risk-free? Can somebody hack Bitcoin? This blog post debunks common security concerns about Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Security\n\nBitcoin provides opportunities for investors and traders to make platforms via platforms like granimator. Individuals and enterprises have made significant profits trading this cryptocurrency on such platforms. However, some people have also lost money, buying Bitcoin at a higher price and selling it when the value drops.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso, crypto scams have led to significant losses when individuals lose money to fraudsters. So, while Bitcoin presents lucrative opportunities for individuals and organizations to make money, it\u2019s wise to be wary of fraudsters and scammers.\n\nBlockchain Enhances Bitcoin Security\n\nBlockchain technology provides built-in security features, making Bitcoin challenging for criminals to hack or corrupt. Although hackers can take over the Bitcoin blockchain, they can only steal tokens from unconfirmed transactions, crypto exchanges, and digital wallets.\n\nBlockchain technology makes Bitcoin decentralized, meaning it has no failure point. Advanced encryption, consensus mechanism, and public ledgers enhance Bitcoin security. Any participant can view blockchain transactions. This transparency level helps prevent fraudulent activities on the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe consensus mechanism helps participants validate transactions on the blockchain without third parties. Computers must solve complex algorithmic puzzles to validate new transactions. Miners get new tokens or rewards after validating transactions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAny entity can corrupt the Bitcoin network only if it has sufficient computing power to control over half. So, although somebody can hack Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, it\u2019s unlikely to have such computing power.\n\nThe 51% Attack\n\nFor somebody to hack Bitcoin, they require control exceeding half of its blockchain. That\u2019s the only way they can corrupt its transaction history. This cryptocurrency hack is what Bitcoin protocol considers a 51% attack.\n\nEven after controlling over 50% of the Bitcoin hashrate or most of the blockchain\u2019s computing power, hackers can only change what miners have not confirmed. A Bitcoin transaction is successful once miners complete six confirmations.\n\nFor example, when you send 1 Bitcoin to your friend, miners confirm and record the transaction in one block, marking the first confirmation. Miners register that block into the next block and val; it before closing the block. And this marks the second confirmation. The exact process must happen four additional times for the network to consider the transaction complete. Hackers can reverse transactions that are yet to complete this process in a 51% attack.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTherefore, hackers can use the digital coins miners had yet to confirm after taking over half the computational power. Also, they can transfer them to anonymous addresses.\n\nOther Possible Hacks\n\nSkilled hackers can also exploit vulnerabilities in the blockchain code. Blockchain developers can make mistakes when coding Bitcoin-based projects. If a developer makes mistakes and takes longer to catch and fix them, hackers can exploit them, leading to losses. However, experts have tested the Bitcoin blockchain and proven it is more resilient to such exploitations.\n\nMost hacks happen in crypto wallets and exchanges. For instance, criminals use phishing attacks to gather the personal information of the crypto wallet holders and use it to access and transfer their Bitcoins. Also, hackers target centralized crypto exchanges will Bitcoins worth billions of dollars. Mt. Gox hack has remained a famous example of a crypto exchange hack in the history of cryptocurrencies. Many crypto experts recommend storing only the number of Bitcoins you intend to use in your trading activity in your crypto exchange account and transferring the rest to a safe digital wallet.\n\nFinal Word\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSomebody can hack Bitcoin. However, the Bitcoin blockchain is challenging to hack, requiring hackers to control over 50% of its computational power. Nevertheless, criminals can exploit vulnerabilities in the blockchain code and weak security measures in digital wallets and crypto exchanges to steal Bitcoins.\n\n--"

At the time of writing, the value of Bitcoin stood at the price point of $25,732 (roughly Rs. 21.3 lakh). Over the weekend, the most expensive cryptocurrency, did record a small drop in its value. Between last Friday and today, the value of cryptocurrency tumbled by $498 (roughly Rs. 41,305). As per Industry analysts, Bitcoin's current resistance is at $26,500 (roughly Rs. 21.9 lakh), If the price falls from the current level, then the immediate support level would be at $25,300 (roughly Rs. 21.8 lakh).\n\n\u201cBTC temporarily surpassed the $26,000 (roughly Rs. 21.5 lakh) level on Friday, but the bulls could not sustain the climb amid bearish market sentiments. This indicates a tussle between the bulls and bears,\u201d Edul Patel, Co-Founder and CEO, Mudrex told Gadgets 360.\n\nEther reflected a dip of 1.24 percent to trade at the price point of $1,612 (roughly Rs. 1.33 lakh). Ether lost $35 (roughly Rs. 2,902) over the weekend.\n\nAmong other loss-making cryptocurrencies, Tether, Binance Coin, Ripple, USD Coin, Cardano, Dogecoin, and Solana marked their names.\n\nPrice dips also struck Polkadot, Polygon, Litecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe valuation of the overall crypto sector dipped by 0.81 percent in the last 24 hours, holding on to $1.03 trillion (roughly Rs. 85,43,556 crore) in capitalisation, showed CoinMarketCap. The crypto fear and greed index continues to be in the fear zone with a score of 40/100 for the second consecutive day.\n\n\u201cThe crypto market traded sideways with downward pressure over the weekend. Investor sentiments seem to low as FTX may soon be able to liquidate its crypto holdings worth $3.4 billion (roughly Rs. 28,200 crore). If this happens, the market may witness a selling pressure which may dampen price action, especially for ETH and SOL,\u201d Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures told Gadgets 360.\n\nStellar, Leo, Underdog, and Husky \u2014 managed to reel-in small profits.\n\n\u201cMarkets are now looking forward to near-term triggers, like the release of US inflation data this week, which will set the course for upcoming interest rate policy. For the crypto market specifically, as a measure of probable approval of the BTC spot ETF, investors are keenly observing the fall in discount of Grayscale's GBTC to spot, which is now at its lowest level in a year,\u201d Chaturvedi further noted.\n\nWhile the crypto market is seeing volatility, industry experts from around the world are not looking to ban the technology. Rather, lawmakers are converging on one point, which is to draft globally acceptable rules to oversee the crypto sector.\n\nOver the weekend, New Delhi hosted the three-day G20 summit, with international dignitaries like US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak among others in attendance.\n\nGita Gopinath, the Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) thanked India for giving the digital assets sector a unified perspective on dealing with crypto assets.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nIs the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 the best foldable phone you can buy in India right now?

        "content": "New falls in the cryptocurrency market . Bitcoin (BTC) trades below $26,000 again and settles around $25,800, while Ethereum (ETH) drops to $1,610.\n\nThe market's mood remains subdued. Any minimally positive news quickly makes digital assets climb, especially the reigning cryptocurrency, but they fail to break above the levels at which they have been moving and end up back in the red after a short time. Last Friday, for example, rumors that JP Morgan would be developing a blockchain-based payments system sent BTC up to $26,200, but it didn't take long for it to trade back around current levels.\n\nCraig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, believes that Bitcoin is continuing to struggle, and arguably the industry as a whole, despite the recent victory for Grayscale over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For Erlam, that the regulator extended the deadline to rule on BlackRock's and other companies' spot ETFs is a particularly frustrating but necessary hurdle.\n\n\"In the meantime, Bitcoin finds itself back around $25,000 and looking rather uninspired. Of course, as we\u2019ve seen so often in the past, that can change in a heartbeat,\" the expert added.\n\nHowever, the data does not seem to provide grounds for a rebound in digital assets barring any major headlines in the crypto space. According to CCData, spot trading in cryptocurrencies is at its lowest level since March 2019: spot trading volume on centralized crypto exchanges retreated 7.78% to $475 billion in August, while derivatives volume fell more than 12% to $1.62 trillion, the second lowest since 2021.\n\nHowever, there are positive signs going forward. ARK Invest, a manager led by Cathie Wood and a driver of BTC and ETH spot ETFs, noted in a report the increased sentiment regarding the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF. According to ARK, GBTC's net asset value (NAV) discount, which represents the difference between the market value of the fund's holdings and the market value of the fund itself, fell to the lowest levels in about a year at an 18% discount after reaching 24% last August. This discount was as high as over 40% at the peak of this year's rallies.\n\nOn the other hand, it is still unclear how the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) recent advance on several decentralized finance companies (DeFi) may affect the market.\n\n\"I believe that these rapid legal developments, which are now expanding to include many aspects related to cryptocurrencies and associated technology, will continue to shape the regulatory and legislative environment for this market, even though they may temporarily frustrate traders. However, further actions by law enforcement authorities may contribute to reducing the state of uncertainty and loss of confidence in this market in the future, with clarity on what is legal and illegal,\" explained Samer Hasn, market analyst at XS.com.\n\nIn other market news, highlights include declines of 1% for Cardano (ADA), 2% for Solana (SOL) and 3% for Ripple (XRP)."

I equate it to the council harbouring stolen property for ten years, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nIt's value has fluctuated over the years, with James claiming two years ago that it was worth \u00a3342 million.\n\nHe previously explained the search was expected to take 9 to 12 months and would be aided by specially employed AI technology.\n\nHe said his plan has been backed by hedge funds who are willing to stump up for the cost of the search as well as the equipment involved in exchange for the lion's share of his fortune.\n\nHe has studied aerial photographs of the site and believes the hard drive is in a 200 metre squared area and could be as deep as 15 metres under the rubbish.\n\nJames' previous plans to trawl through the tip have included robotic arms, manual pickers and factory-standard machinery.\n\nBut over the years the council has repeatedly shut down his plans for excavation, citing a variety of reasons ranging from environmental permits to the likelihood of finding his device.\n\nJames, however, thinks \"the excuses are just fluff.\"\n\n\"We have experts that can mitigate every single concern. People who deal with landfills for a living. These are not new techniques [his team are proposing] - it\u2019s just about bringing them all together.\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to estimate what the hard drive will be like when we get it,\" he did admit.\n\n\"We could find it and it could be cracked into a million pieces. I accept that. But we could find it and it could be stuck under something and be fine - that is just as likely. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA Council spokesperson said: \"Newport City Council has been contacted multiple times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins, which may or may not be in our landfill site.\n\n\"The council has told Mr Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit, and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area.\n\n\"The council is the only body authorised to carry out operations on the site. We have been very clear and consistent in our responses that we cannot assist Mr Howells in this matter.\n\n\"Our position has not changed. We will be offering no further comments on this issue as it takes up valuable officer time which could be spent on delivering services for the residents of Newport.\"\n\n4 While he accepts the drive may be damaged beyond repair, he is insistent on searching for it anyway Credit: WNS\n\n4 A council spokesperson had said their position \"will not change\" Credit: WNS\n\nINVESTMENT WARNING\n\nBuying any cryptocurrency is incredibly risky.\n\nWith any investment, there is a risk that the value of your money could go down as well as up. That means you should only invest money you can afford to lose.\n\nCrypto can be riskier than other investments because they are volatile and speculative - their price often rising and falls very quickly, sometimes seemingly for not reason.\n\nMany cryptocurrencies have a short track record, making them difficult to understand and predict.\n\nThis type of investment is also not protected by the regulator which means you have no protection if things go wrong.\n\nThe UK regulator has warned that Brits risk losing ALL of their money if they invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf you are considering investing in any type of crypto, do your research first and only invest money you can afford to lose.\n\nBe wary of scams, too, as the crypto market is often a target for fraud.\n\nLook out for fake celebrity endorsements or social media profiles pushing certain coins."

        "title": "eToro: the latest news and a future price forecasting for Bitcoin - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article, we look at what are the latest market news for Bitcoin and a future price forecasting, according to investment broker eToro.\n\nAt the center of the discussions we find an issue related to cryptocurrency mining, which is increasingly becoming an incentive for energy sustainability, with a rare event in which a user paid 19 BTC, or about $500,000, as a fee on the crypto network.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s look at a price analysis and a forecasting of Bitcoin\u2019s future trend: are we close to the long-awaited bull market?\n\nAll the details below.\n\neToro and the latest market news for Bitcoin: mining boosts energy sustainability\n\nThe latest crypto news offered by eToro is primarily about an affair that has to do with Bitcoin mining and its predisposition to incentivize the use of renewable energy.\n\nLast week, one of Texas\u2019 leading computing power providers, Riot Blockchain, released its August results, revealing that it received a $32 million economic incentive for reducing its power consumption during peak hours when the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) struggles to support high demand.\n\nThis strategy is called \u201cdemand response\u201d and is precisely based on the voluntary decision by large industries to halt energy demand during the hottest hours so that the power grid can maintain its stability while avoiding heavy blackouts.\n\nAs a reward, ERCOT gave Riot a reward of $32 million in energy credits, which is a significant income compared to the mining company\u2019s monthly revenues.\n\nCompared to July, Riot managed to mine fewer BTC in August due to reduced energy consumption, while counting a significant increase in \u201cPower credits\u201d and \u201cDemand Response Credits.\u201d\n\nIn detail, counting a reduction in revenue from BTC sales of $3.5 million, we can observe an increase in economic incentives of $23.8 million.\n\nWhat happened with the mining company in August is proof that this sector can somehow incentivize energy sustainability by improving the operation of power grids.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin miners can be a release valve for renewable energy by allowing for a steady economic return, enabling them to partially abate the costs associated with building and maintaining photovoltaic panels and wind turbines.\n\nOf note in this regard is how in the United Kingdom last week there was a failure of a wind auction due to the associated uneconomic costs.\n\nDigital gold mining could in this sense offer an unconventional solution to support the development of renewable energy by contributing economically to its sustenance\n\nA massive $500,000 fee for a cryptocurrency network user\n\nAnother news report from eToro concerns a curious affair involving a Bitcoin whale and a whopping $500,000 fee paid for a single transaction.\n\nIndeed, looking at the data from \u201cMempool.space\u201d we can see how in block 807057 the total fees for miners amount to 20.013 BTC, much higher than those recorded in the previous block, where we see a total of 0.178 BTC.\n\nThe address bc1qr35hws365juz5rtlsjtvmulu97957kqvr3zpw3 is responsible for this anomaly since it paid a whopping 1,982,108,632 sat (about 19 BTC), equivalent to $510,770 to execute a single transaction on Saturday, September 9 at 7:10 PM (CET).\n\nThis is the largest commission paid to date within the Bitcoin network.\n\nUsually a user may decide to pay multiple fees to get priority confirmation of his tx, however in this case the order of magnitude seems so exaggerated as to suggest a typing error.\n\nOn average it costs about $2 to perform a transaction in Bitcoin according to current data.\n\nIn May, under the wave of Fomo ushered in with the advent of Ordinals, average fees came to cost about $30, an exaggerated value but extremely far from the half-million dollar figure.\n\nIn any case, looking at the address in question we can see a balance of more than 400 BTC, equal to more than $10 million, and a considerable amount of transactions that were executed after the one related to the huge fee.\n\nThus, the mishap has not hindered the whale, which while recording a painful mistake does not seem to have gone down, continuing its operations at a high pace.\n\nFuture price forecasting for Bitcoin by eToro: the week of truth?\n\nAfter reporting the news reported by the broker eToro, let\u2019s look at a future price forecast for Bitcoin. We are in a very important week that may decree the price action in the coming months until the end of the year.\n\nAt the moment BTC is at around $25,720, poised between a possible bullish restart and a tremendous bearish shakeout.\n\nPrices have been stagnating at this level now since 19 August giving signs that signal a likely descent ahead.\n\nThe only bullish attempt dated 19 August, on the news that Grayscale had won a very important lawsuit against the SEC, was promptly absorbed by the next two candles that erased all previous gains.\n\nMoreover, the directionality of the short trend is blatantly bearish with the asset holding firm below the EMA 10 and EMA 50.\n\nA break of the $25,000 would take us straight to $23,000 and then to $20,000, where major support is located.\n\nCountering the bears\u2019 assumptions is the RSI indicator, which shows us an interesting bullish divergence on a daily time frame: while in fact prices have been going sideways since mid-August, the RSI is rising and could lead prices to a pump in the coming days.\n\nAs such, a quick recovery of $28,000 and then $30,000 could invalidate bear theories and bring bulls back into the market.\n\nHowever, the outlook between now and the next few weeks remains negative, and it seems that we should wait until next year before an actual return to the bull market.\n\n2024 could be the year for us to be able to find Bitcoin at its all-time highs again, given the coincidence with the halving, which usually prompts the cryptocurrency to increase its price significantly in anticipation of reduced supply in the markets.\n\nHang on holders, it can\u2019t rain forever."
