        "title": "SEC approve new bitcoin funds - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday reluctantly approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin, saying it is still deeply skeptical about cryptocurrencies and that its decision did not mean it approves or endorses bitcoin.\n\nThe SEC said it gave the green light to 11 exchange-traded funds for bitcoin even though it only faced a deadline for one application. The agency said that would provide competition and a \u201clevel playing field.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETFs could open the door to cryptocurrencies to many new investors who don\u2019t want to take the extra steps involved in buying actual bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s a major win for Wall Street, particularly trillion-dollar fund managers like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Invesco that have pushed hard to get the SEC to approve their applications. It\u2019s also a win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has needed a win after nearly two years of turmoil that has resulted in the failure of several crypto firms, most notably FTX in November 2022.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval, however, was lukewarm at best. Gary Gensler, the agency\u2019s chairman, has repeatedly said cryptocurrencies need more regulation and investor protections.\n\n\u201cInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\u201d Gensler said.\n\nOther commissioners expressed alarm that the SEC agreed to approve the funds.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of U.S. households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets,\u201d Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw said in her dissent.\n\nAn exchange traded fund is an easy way to invest in assets or a group of assets, like gold, junk bonds or bitcoins, without having to directly buy the assets themselves. Cryptocurrency advocates hope the development thrusts the once niche and nerdy corner of the internet even further into the financial mainstream. ETFs can be purchased quickly with any brokerage and trade on an exchange like the Nasdaq stock market.\n\nThe regulatory greenlight has been anticipated for several months and the price of bitcoin has jumped about 70% since October as crypto investors speculated the broad use of bitcoin ETFs would drive up demand for the cryptocurrency. The price of etherium, the second-most popular cryptocurrency, has also risen on speculation that fund managers will create ETFs around it.\n\nSome analysts think that ETFs may help stabilize crypto prices by broadening their use and potential audience. But many remain concerned that broad use of crypto ETFs could put too much risk and volatility into Americans\u2019 retirement accounts.\n\n\u201cThe notorious price volatility of Bitcoin, as well as its fluctuating values against stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks,\u201d said Yiannis Giokas, senior director of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nIn a twist perhaps appropriate for the unpredictable crypto industry, a fake tweet from the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s account on X Tuesday stated that trading of bitcoin ETFs had been approved but the agency had not issued any approval.\n\nHere are some things to know about bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWHY ALL THE EXCITEMENT OVER A BITCOIN ETF?\n\nAn exchange traded fund, or ETF, is an easy way to invest in something or a group of things, like gold or junk bonds, without having to buy the things themselves. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs trade like stocks, which means they can be bought and sold throughout the day.\n\nSince the inception of bitcoin, anyone wanting to own one would have to buy it. That in turn would mean either having to learn what a cold wallet is or having to open an account at a crypto trading platform like Coinbase or Binance.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF could open the door to many new investors who don\u2019t want to take such extra steps.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has already soared in anticipation of the SEC\u2019s approval, with bitcoin trading at $45,890 Wednesday, up from around $27,000 in mid-October. The price had sunk as low as $16,000 in November of 2022 following the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX.\n\nHOW WOULD THE ETF WORK?\n\nThe Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has already been trading since 2021, but it holds futures related to bitcoin, not the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nThe new bitcoin ETF will perform like the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), which allows anyone to invest in gold without having to find someplace to store a bar or having to protect it. It\u2019s the same reason some people invest in the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK), which lets investors simply buy one thing instead of the more than 1,000 low-quality bonds that make up the index.\n\nHOW MANY BITCOIN ETFS COULD THERE BE?\n\nThe SEC said it gave approval to 11 ETFs, but more are certain to apply for trading in the coming months.\n\nWHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF AN ETF?\n\nLongtime crypto fans might object. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were created in part due to mistrust of the traditional financial system. Wall Street would become an intermediary between investors and cryptocurrency in the case of ETFs.\n\nETFs also charge fees, though they tend to be relatively low compared with the overall financial industry. These fees are shown through what\u2019s called the expense ratio, which indicates how much of a fund\u2019s assets the ETF will take each year to cover its costs.\n\nWHEN IS IT BETTER TO HOLD ACTUAL BITCOIN?\n\nAn ETF will not put actual cryptocurrency into investors\u2019 accounts, meaning that they cannot use it. Also, an ETF would not provide investors with the same anonymity that crypto does, one of the big draws for many crypto investors.\n\nWHAT CONCERNS SHOULD INVESTORS HAVE?\n\nThe biggest concern for an investor in one of these ETFs is the notorious volatility in the price of bitcoin.\n\nDespite failing to catch on as a replacement for fiat, or paper, currencies, bitcoin soared near $68,000 in November of 2021. A year later it fell below $20,000 as investors in general shunned riskier assets and a series of company blowups and scandals shook faith in the crypto industry.\n\nEven as regulators and law enforcement crack down on some of cryptos bad actors, like Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, the industry still has a modern \u201cWild West\u201d feel to it. The hack of the SEC\u2019s X account raises questions about both the ability of scammers to manipulate the price of bitcoin and SEC\u2019s own ability to stop them."

        "title": "US approves Bitcoin investment product. Here's why it matters - ABC News",
        "content": "Bitcoin ETFs could bring a flood of investments but also pose risks.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday gave its approval for some Bitcoin ETFs, just a day after a fake post on the agency's account on X made a similar announcement and sent the value of Bitcoin soaring.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin vaulted skyward on Tuesday afternoon after the SEC appeared to deliver a major breakthrough for the cryptocurrency.\n\nMinutes after the post went up Tuesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler punctured the euphoria, saying on X that a hacker had commandeered the agency's account and sent out a fake message. The price of Bitcoin plummeted.\n\nSome analysts say Bitcoin ETFs -- Exchange-Traded Funds -- could bring tens of billions of dollars of investment this year and catapult the price of Bitcoin.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Gensler confirmed the decision but offered a note of caution about cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter announcing that the SEC had \"approved the listing and tradition\" of some Bitcoin ETFs, Gensler added: \"We did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\"\n\nA Bitcoin ETF allows investors to buy into an asset that tracks the price movement of Bitcoin, while avoiding the inconvenience and risk of purchasing the crypto coin itself. But critics warn the investment product could do harm to investors exposed to the volatility and uncertainty of crypto.\n\nHere's what to know about Bitcoin ETFs and what's at stake in their potential approval:\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF uses a decades-old trading method as a means of easing investment in digital assets.\n\nAn ETF amounts to a bucket of securities that gives investors a way to bet that an underlying asset will increase in price without purchasing that asset.\n\nFor instance, an ETF for gold allows individuals and institutions to put money on the price movement of the precious metal rather than buy, lug and store the physical item.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF, in turn, gives investors access to the cryptocurrency market without facing the technical impediments and fees associated with navigating a crypto exchange.\n\nTraders could find Bitcoin on traditional trading platforms and markets that many of them find trustworthy, assuaging concern about relatively young and scandal-ridden crypto technology.\n\nTop investment firms like Fidelity and BlackRock were set to offer Bitcoin ETF products once federal approval is given.\n\nWhile nearly 90% of U.S. adults say they've heard at least a little about cryptocurrency, three-quarters say they aren't confident about the safety and trustworthiness of current means for investing in the products, a Pew survey in April found.\n\nWhat will happen after Bitcoin ETFs are made available?\n\nSome analysts say the new products could unleash a flow of investment and trigger a major spike in the price of Bitcoin, supercharging the most well-known and successful digital asset.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would elicit more than $14 billion of investment inflows within its first year on the market and nearly $40 billion by the end of the third year, according to Galaxy Digital, a crypto management and research firm.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during afternoon trading, Jan. 9, 2024, in New York. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nStandard Chartered Bank, a U.K.-based lender, offered a more bullish assessment, saying the financial instrument could induce as much as $100 billion worth of inflows by the end of this year, crypto outlet CoinDesk reported on Tuesday.\n\nUnder such a scenario, the price of Bitcoin could reach near $200,000 by the end of 2025, more than quadrupling the current value of the crypto coin, Standard Chartered Bank said, according to CoinDesk.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has jumped nearly 70% over the past six months, in part due to anticipation of a surge if the Bitcoin ETF gains approval.\n\nCritics of the financial instrument, however, say it could wreak significant damage to investors due to the volatility of Bitcoin as well as its potential use in illicit activities.\n\nDennis Kelleher, the CEO of nonprofit transparency group Better Markets, co-authored a letter to an SEC official last week warning of significant risk posed by the pending approval.\n\n\"It would be a grave if not historic mistake almost certainly leading to massive investor harm if the SEC approves the pending rule changes,\" Kelleher wrote.\n\nHe added, \"The massive and unrelenting fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin market means that approving these products would expose those investors to the very harms that the SEC exists to prevent.\"\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nThe crypto industry entered this year bruised after a series of high-profile collapses and company scandals.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, formerly one of the industry's most prominent figures, could serve decades in prison after he was convicted on fraud charges in a federal trial. Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, faces a jail sentence of up to 18 months after he pleaded guilty to federal charges of money laundering.\n\nGovernment approval for a Bitcoin ETF injects a much-needed jolt of good news for the ailing sector. But, as some critics fear, the financial product could widen the reach of crypto and pose further risk.\n\n\"We believe retail investors should wait to see whether these products can garner enough traction to see the light of day -- let alone see convincing performance,\" Manan Agarwal and Sabeeh Ashhar, analysts with financial services firm Morningstar, wrote in August."

        "title": "SEC gives bitcoin ETFs the green light - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nAfter a false start Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its approval Wednesday for some investment companies to offer \u201cspot bitcoin\u201d exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s highly anticipated move is expected to make bitcoin investing more accessible to Main Street investors, without requiring them to own the digital asset directly.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler made it clear in a statement on the SEC\u2019s website that the agency remains wary. \u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe SEC had a deadline of January 10 to offer a decision for just one of the 11 firms that applied to offer bitcoin ETFs. On Wednesday it offered approval to all 11 of them.\n\nBitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has a current market cap of roughly $900 billion. It has seen volatile price swings throughout its 15-year history. Most recently, after hitting an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, it fell below $17,000 during the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d of 2022 and has mostly been trading north of $45,000 in the run-up to the SEC\u2019s decision.\n\nAbout an hour after the news Wednesday, the price of bitcoin was up 0.3%% to nearly $46,000, according to data on coinmarketcap.com.\n\nAfter the stock market close on Tuesday, a post on the SEC\u2019s X account falsely claimed the regulatory agency had approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\n\nThat was quickly debunked by Gensler, and the SEC took down the message. According to X, an \u201cunidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party\u201d was responsible for the post. On Wednesday, the SEC said the FBI was looking into the matter.\n\nBitcoin ETFs, like bitcoin, carry risks for investors\n\nFor those considering jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon, it\u2019s important to note that the price of a bitcoin will be just as volatile whether you invest in it directly yourself or through an ETF.\n\nEarlier this week, Gensler posted a thread on X warning investors of the risks of crypto investing generally. \u201cInvestments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile. A number of major platforms & crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk,\u201d his post read.\n\nThose sentiments have been echoed by many financial advisers and the investor watchdog group Better Markets, which strongly opposed the SEC\u2019s approval of bitcoin ETFs. Among its objections is the bitcoin market\u2019s history of artificially inflated trading volumes known as \u201cwash\u201d trading.\n\nIn a scathing statement following the SEC\u2019s announcement, the group\u2019s president and CEO Dennis Kelleher pulled no punches. \u201cWith the flagrantly lawless crypto industry crashing and burning due to a mountain of arrests, criminal convictions, bankruptcies, lawsuits, scandals, massive losses, and millions of investor and customer victims, who would have thought that the SEC would come to its rescue by approving a trusted and familiar investment vehicle that will enable the mass marketing of a known worthless, volatile, and fraud-filled financial product to Main Street Americans.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are many crypto advocates who are very pleased with the move. \u201cA spot Bitcoin ETF is a bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of crypto. Allowing investors to partake in the bitcoin journey without the technical hurdles of direct ownership is a significant step towards inclusivity,\u201d said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation in an emailed statement.\n\nThe full list of companies that got SEC approval to launch bitcoin ETFs are: Ark Invest together with 21 Shares; Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Hashdex, Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie and VanEck. Some of their ETFs will be trading as soon as tomorrow."

Some of the largest financial firms in the world, including the asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity, were approved to offer the products, known as E.T.F.s, which could begin trading as soon as Thursday on traditional platforms like the Nasdaq.\n\nThe approvals were hailed as a sign that mainstream financial institutions remain willing to deal in digital currencies even after 18 months of market crashes and high-profile bankruptcies. Since the fall, Bitcoin\u2019s price has surged more than 60 percent, as traders bet that approval of the new crypto products would give the industry an imprimatur of regulatory legitimacy, drawing fresh investment from professional wealth managers and amateur traders.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin shot up on Tuesday after a post appeared on the S.E.C.\u2019s official X account announcing the approval of the E.T.F.s, but dropped swiftly when Gary Gensler, the S.E.C. chair, said the agency\u2019s account had been hacked."

        "title": "SEC's Approval of a Bitcoin Crypto ETF Is an Historic Mistake That Will Harm Investors, Markets, and Financial Stability - Better Markets",
        "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014 Dennis M. Kelleher, Co-founder, President, and CEO of Better Markets issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of a Bitcoin ETF:\n\n\u201cWith the flagrantly lawless crypto industry crashing and burning due to a mountain of arrests, criminal convictions, bankruptcies, lawsuits, scandals, massive losses, and millions of investor and customer victims, who would have thought that the SEC would come to its rescue by approving a trusted and familiar investment vehicle that will enable the mass marketing of a known worthless, volatile, and fraud-filled financial product to Main Street Americans. Bitcoin and crypto are worse than the chips you can buy at a casino because at least the casino is regulated; the spot Bitcoin market is not and that\u2019s what the ETF is going to be pricing. There will be no SEC regulation or policing of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it: the SEC\u2019s actions today are not required by or supported by the facts or law, including not required by the Grayscale court decision, as we spelled out in our comment letters here and here. The court in Grayscale merely said that the SEC failed to sufficiently explain its prior rejection. The SEC could \u2014 and should have \u2014 rejected the ETF applications and better detailed why it did so, importantly including a showing that \u201cas much as 77.5% of the total trading volume on unregulated exchanges was due to wash trading\u201d and as much as 95% of Bitcoin trading \u201ccould be due to wash trading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this approval of a Bitcoin ETF is an historic mistake that will not only unleash crypto predators on tens of millions of investors and retirees but will also likely undermine financial stability. It will be interpreted and spun as a de facto SEC \u2013 if not U.S. government \u2013 endorsement of crypto generally. The crypto industry\u2019s marketing machinery can be expected to claim or imply that this decision legitimizes crypto as a safe and appropriate investment for hardworking Main Street retail investors and those saving for retirement. However, the SEC\u2019s action today has changed nothing about this worthless financial product : Bitcoin and crypto still have no legitimate use; remain the preferred product of speculators, gamblers, predators, and criminals; and continue to be cesspools of fraud, manipulation, and criminality.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the SEC\u2019s action, America\u2019s investors will have at least four levels of false comfort : first, the SEC\u2019s imprimatur; second, a well-known, trusted ETF investment vehicle; third, the involvement and legitimacy of traditional and trusted financial firms like Blackrock and Fidelity; and fourth, a belief that there will be meaningful regulation and investor protections.\n\n\u201cThe truth is there is and will be no effective cop on the Bitcoin beat. The CFTC is supposed to be the cop on that beat, but CFTC Chair Behnam has been little more than a biased crypto cheerleader rather than an independent financial regulator. While meeting with FTX\u2019s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried 10 times in just 14 months, Behnam prioritized expanding the crypto market and his agency\u2019s jurisdiction over the protection of the public. He was a \u201ckey ally\u201d to FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried and worked to deliver them regulatory and legislative victories. Even after FTX went bankrupt and $8 billion of customer funds were reportedly missing, he continued to push their top legislative priority in giving crypto jurisdiction to the smallest, least funded, and most easily capturable agency. However, even if the CFTC had a Chair that wanted to be a cop on the beat, the CFTC cannot be one because it has been and continues to be chronically and grossly underfunded.[1]\n\n\u201cAnother highly consequential result of this decision will be that crypto gets more interconnected with the core of the traditional financial and banking systems, which will dramatically increase the risk of systemic crashes and bailouts. That\u2019s why this decision is similar to the decision to deregulate derivatives in 2000, which led in just a few years to the catastrophic financial crash in 2008. History may well see this action as lighting the fuse of a crypto boom and what will almost certainly lead to a crypto bust with likely crashes, contagion and worse.\u201d\n\n###\n\nBetter Markets is a non-profit, non-partisan, and independent organization founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to promote the public interest in the financial markets, support the financial reform of Wall Street and make our financial system work for all Americans again. Better Markets works with allies\u2014including many in finance\u2014to promote pro-market, pro-business and pro-growth policies that help build a stronger, safer financial system that protects and promotes Americans\u2019 jobs, savings, retirements and more.

Its enforcement budget is just $67 million with 172 full-time employees, which it needs to police the multi-trillion-dollar derivatives and commodities markets in addition to the bitcoin market. That\u2019s why the unseemly bragging about its so-called enforcement record against \u201cdigital assets\u201d is more rhetoric than reality. They aren\u2019t fooling anyone, including the crypto industry which continues to push for legislation putting the CFTC in charge of regulating them. There is a reason they are spending tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the CFTC as their regulator."

        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nBitcoin initially jumped as high as $47,901, its highest level since March 2022, according to Coin Metrics, before dropping to as low as $44,816.94. It was last trading lower by more than 1% at $46,162.79.\n\nThe SEC later deleted the post and said its account on X was compromised and it had not approved the ETFs.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell during late afternoon trading Tuesday following a false social media post from the X account of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that stated the agency had approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds for trading.\n\n\"The sell-off is showing a rattled market,\" said Michael Rinko, research analyst at Delphi Digital. \"This kind of high-volume boomerang event probably spooked some people and led to people taking some risk off the table, but the initial market reaction is encouraging.\"\n\nInvestors had expected an update from the SEC as soon as tomorrow, with some hoping the decision would come earlier. Wednesday marks the deadline for the SEC to either approve or deny the Ark 21Shares spot bitcoin ETF application. It is widely believed that the agency will approve several at once.\n\nBitcoin had traded below the $47,000 level for much of Tuesday, after crossing it one day prior for the first time since April 2022, as updated SEC filings from potential bitcoin ETF issuers bolstered investors' confidence that an approval is inevitable.\n\nSome investors say the day one effect of an approval has been overestimated and that it could be a sell-the-news event. Bitcoin has advanced about 60% in the past three months, primarily as a result of the ETF hype. Additionally, investors have been sitting on high unrealized profits \u2014 a trend that historically precedes price corrections \u2014 according to data from CryptoQuant.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "A California man who lost $100,000 in a 2021 SIM-swapping attack is suing the unknown holder of a cryptocurrency wallet that harbors his stolen funds. The case is thought to be the first in which a federal court has recognized the use of information included in a bitcoin transaction \u2014 such as a link to a civil claim filed in federal court \u2014 as reasonably likely to provide notice of the lawsuit to the defendant. Experts say the development could make it easier for victims of crypto heists to recover stolen funds through the courts without having to wait years for law enforcement to take notice or help.\n\nRyan Dellone, a healthcare worker in Fresno, Calif., asserts that thieves stole his bitcoin on Dec. 14, 2021, by executing an unauthorized SIM-swap that involved an employee at his mobile phone provider who switched Dellone\u2019s phone number over to a new device the attackers controlled.\n\nDellone says the crooks then used his phone number to break into his account at Coinbase and siphon roughly $100,000 worth of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, which alleges the company ignored multiple red flags, and that it should have detected and stopped the theft. Coinbase did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWorking with experts who track the flow of funds stolen in cryptocurrency heists, Dellone\u2019s lawyer Ethan Mora identified a bitcoin wallet that was the ultimate destination of his client\u2019s stolen crypto. Mora says his client has since been made aware that the bitcoin address in question is embroiled in an ongoing federal investigation into a cryptocurrency theft ring.\n\nMora said it\u2019s unclear if the bitcoin address that holds his client\u2019s stolen money is being held by the government or by the anonymous hackers. Nevertheless, he is pursuing a novel legal strategy that allows his client to serve notice of the civil suit to that bitcoin address \u2014 and potentially win a default judgment to seize his client\u2019s funds within \u2014 without knowing the identity of his attackers or anything about the account holder.\n\nIn a civil lawsuit seeking monetary damages, a default judgment is usually entered on behalf of the plaintiff if the defendant fails to respond to the complaint within a specified time. Assuming that the cybercriminals who stole the money don\u2019t dispute Dellone\u2019s claim, experts say the money could be seized by cryptocurrency exchanges if the thieves ever tried to move it or spend it.\n\nThe U.S. courts have generally held that if you\u2019re going to sue someone, you have to provide some kind of meaningful and timely communication about that lawsuit to the defendant in a way that is reasonably likely to provide them notice.\n\nNot so long ago, you had track down your defendant and hire someone to physically serve them with a copy of the court papers. But legal experts say the courts have evolved their thinking in recent years about what constitutes meaningful service, and now allow notification via email.\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2023, a federal judge in the Eastern District of California granted Dellone permission to serve notice of his lawsuit directly to the suspected hackers\u2019 bitcoin address \u2014 using a short message that was attached to roughly $100 worth of bitcoin Mora sent to the address.\n\nBitcoin transactions are public record, and each transaction can be sent along with an optional short message. The message uses what\u2019s known as an \u201cOP RETURN,\u201d or an instruction of the Bitcoin scripting language that allows users to attach metadata to a transaction \u2014 and thus save it on the blockchain.\n\nIn the $100 bitcoin transaction Mora sent to the disputed bitcoin address, the OP RETURN message read: \u201cOSERVICE \u2013 SUMMONS, COMPLAINT U.S. Dist. E.D. Cal. LINK: t.ly/123cv01408_service,\u201d which is a short link to a copy of the lawsuit hosted on Google Drive.\n\n\u201cThe courts are adapting to the new style of service of process,\u201d said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice. \u201cAnd that\u2019s helpful and useful and necessary.\u201d\n\nRasch said Mora\u2019s strategy could force the government to divulge information about their case, or else explain to a judge why the plaintiff shouldn\u2019t be able to recover their stolen funds without further delay. Rasch said it could be that Dellone\u2019s stolen crypto was seized as part of a government asset forfeiture, but that either way there is no reason Uncle Sam should hold some cybercrime victims\u2019 life savings indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t need the crypto as evidence, but in a forfeiture action the money goes to the government,\u201d Rasch said. \u201cBut it was never the government\u2019s money, and that doesn\u2019t help the victim. The government should be providing information to the victims of cryptocurrency theft so that their attorneys can go get the money back themselves.\u201d\n\nNick Bax is a security researcher who specializes in tracing the labyrinthine activity of criminals trying to use cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial instruments to launder the proceeds of cybercrime. Bax said Mora\u2019s method could allow more victims to stake legitimate legal claims to their stolen funds.\n\n\u201cIf you get a default judgment against a bitcoin address, for example, and then down the road that bitcoin gets sent to an exchange that complies with or abides by U.S. court orders, then it\u2019s yours,\u201d Bax said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen funds with a court order on them get frozen by the exchanges that decided it made sense to comply with orders from a U.S. federal court.\u201d\n\nBax\u2019s research was featured in a Sept. 2023 story here about how experts now believe it\u2019s likely hackers are cracking open some of the password vaults stolen in the 2022 data breach at LastPass.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot victims who have had life-changing amounts of money being seized and would like that money back,\u201d Bax said. \u201cA big goal here is just making civil cases more efficient. Because then people can help themselves and they don\u2019t need to rely solely on law enforcement with its limited resources. And that\u2019s really the goal: To scale this and make it economically viable.\u201d\n\nWhile Dellone\u2019s lawsuit may be the first time anyone has obtained approval from a federal judge to use bitcoin to notify another party of a civil action, the technique has been used in several recent unrelated cases involving other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and NFTs.\n\nThe law firm DLAPiper writes that in November 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida \u201cauthorized service of a lawsuit seeking the recovery of stolen digital assets by way of a non-fungible token or NFT containing the text of the complaint and summons, as well as a hyperlink to a website created by the plaintiffs containing all pleadings and orders in the action.\u201d\n\nIn approving Dellone\u2019s request for service via bitcoin transaction, the judge overseeing the case cited a recent New York Superior Court ruling in a John Doe case brought by victims seeking to unmask the crooks behind a $1.3 million cyberheist.\n\nIn the New York case, the state trial court found it was acceptable for the plaintiffs to serve notice of the suit via cryptocurrency transactions because the defendants regularly used the Blockchain address to which the tokens were sent, and had recently done so. Also, the New York court found that because the account in question contained a significant sum of money, it was unlikely to be abandoned or forgotten.\n\n\u201cThus the court inferred the defendants were likely to access the account in the future,\u201d wrote Judge Helena M. March-Kuchta, for the Eastern District of California, summarizing the New York case. \u201cFinally, the plaintiff had no alternative means of contacting these unknown defendants.\u201d\n\nExperts say regardless of the reason for a cryptocurrency theft or loss \u2014 whether it\u2019s from a romance scam or a straight-up digital mugging \u2014 it\u2019s important for victims to file an official report both with their local police and with the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (ic3.gov). The IC3 collects reports on cybercrime and sometimes bundles victim reports into cases for DOJ/FBI prosecutors and investigators.\n\nThe hard truth is that most victims will never see their stolen funds again. But sometimes federal investigators win minor victories and manage to seize or freeze crypto assets that are known to be associated with specific crimes and criminals. In those cases, the government will eventually make an effort to find, contact and in some cases remunerate known victims.\n\nIt might take many years for this process to unfold. But if and when they do make that effort, federal investigators are likely to focus their energies and attention responding to victims who staked a claim and can support it with documentation.\n\nBut have no illusions that any of this is likely to happen in a timeframe that is meaningful to victims in the short run. For example, in 2013 the U.S. government seized the assets of the virtual currency Liberty Reserve, massively disrupting a major vehicle for laundering the proceeds of cybercrime and other illegal activities.\n\nWhen the government offered remuneration to Liberty Reserve account holders who wished to make a financial loss claim and supply supporting documentation, KrebsOnSecurity filed a claim. There wasn\u2019t money much in my Liberty Reserve account; I simply wanted to know how long it would take for federal investigators to follow up on my claim, or indeed if they would at all.\n\nIn 2020 KrebsOnSecurity was contacted by an investigator with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who was seeking to discuss my claim. The investigator said they would have called sooner, but that it had taken that long for the IRS to gain legal access to the funds seized in the 2013 Liberty Reserve takedown."

        "title": "What is a spot bitcoin ETP? | Fidelity - Fidelity Investments",
        "content": "Potential pros of spot bitcoin ETPs\n\nMay make crypto more accessible to the public\n\nThose new to crypto can find it hard to understand the details behind buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Which platform should I use to buy crypto? Was my purchase recorded on the blockchain? Where are the coins I just bought stored? These questions can be daunting for first-timers.\n\nThen, once you\u2019ve made your purchase, there are financial planning considerations that differ from those of traditional assets. For example, when it comes to reporting taxes for traditional assets, your gains and losses can often be synced to tax preparation software with a single click through your brokerage platform. Reporting crypto taxes, however, may require uploading documents to your tax preparation software, as the ability to sync seamlessly with platforms offering crypto may not yet exist. Apart from taxes, there are also unique steps necessary for fitting crypto into your estate plan.\n\nThese factors may make those who are unfamiliar with crypto\u2019s nuances hesitant to invest. They can also make it harder for financial advisors to incorporate crypto into an investment plan for clients.\n\nBuying spot bitcoin ETPs, however, operates much like buying an index fund or sector ETF. Investors can complete everything through more traditional routes, including brokerage accounts, IRAs, and trusts, which simplifies many of the questions above. Tax and estate planning considerations may also be simpler to manage through this route.\n\nNote: Despite the potential advantages, remember that spot bitcoin ETPs hold bitcoin as their underlying asset. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and may be more susceptible to market manipulation than other securities.\n\nNevertheless, in general, the ETPs remove significant hurdles for investors who want exposure to bitcoin.\n\nMay have fewer security considerations compared to buying bitcoin\n\nThose who aren\u2019t familiar with the nuances of crypto cybersecurity may also find it confusing to learn how to keep their bitcoin secure. Protecting your bitcoin requires knowing the difference between hot and cold wallets, ways to avoid scams, features of reliable custodians, and other best practices.\n\nThese aspects are critical knowledge for bitcoin owners because there is no central customer service team in crypto. If you\u2019re hacked or scammed, or if the crypto exchange you\u2019re storing your coins on collapses, you may lose access to your investments forever.\n\nFor those who have been hesitant about buying crypto because of these risks, spot bitcoin ETPs are an alternative that potentially comes with fewer of these risks. With the ETP, you only need to protect the login to your financial platform, rather than learn and manage multiple cybersecurity nuances. However, note that you are still trusting that the ETP issuer is managing these cybersecurity nuances effectively.\n\nAdditionally, ETPs in general are subject to certain regulatory oversight from government agencies. This contrasts with the crypto market, which is currently less regulated. Some investors may feel more confident buying an asset that is subject to regulation."

Approved applicants for bitcoin ETFs include Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Hashdex, BZX, VanExk, WisdomTree, and Franklin.\n\nApplications for bitcoin ETFs first popped up in 2013, but had been repeatedly rejected by the SEC up until now.\n\nTrading can begin as early as tomorrow, January 11, 2024, with over a dozen bitcoin ETF applicants \u2014 including Fidelity, BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark Investments, and 21Shares \u2014 eager to launch new products.\n\n\"We've fought with the SEC for ages, and they have been really slow in accepting the cryptocurrency market,\" says Stuart John Barton, CFP and co-founder of Volatility Shares. \"The SEC has lost enough battles and is now realizing they may have been leaning too conservative and need to loosen up. The SEC should be working with the investment community to improve products and make them better, not just stand in the way of innovation.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about bitcoin ETFs.\n\nInvest in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether, and more with some of the best cryptocurrency exchanges. The best crypto trading platforms offer advanced chart tools, real-time market data, low trading fees, and account flexibility.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nA bitcoin ETF, not to be confused with a bitcoin futures ETF, is an exchange-traded fund that can directly hold bitcoin among other investable securities. Unlike bitcoin itself, which can only be bought and sold along the blockchain, bitcoin ETFs can be traded by retail investors through regular brokerage accounts.\n\n\"It opens the crypto market up to a broader world. Over time, we're likely to see a maturing market with more people trading and buying bitcoin,\" says Barton, \"In a more general sense, it just simplifies the process as most Americans have brokerage accounts. That means pretty much everybody has access to bitcoin ETFs.\"\n\nAlthough bitcoin futures ETFs were first introduced on the NYSE back in 2021, investors still haven't been able to invest directly in bitcoin through an ETF until today. But with bitcoin ETFs, people can more easily mitigate risk, simplify the investing process, and increase overall portfolio diversification.\n\nA bitcoin ETF doesn't have to just hold bitcoin, either. Just like any other exchange-traded fund, bitcoin ETFs can be a combination of crypto, stocks, bonds, and other commodities. Bitcoin ETFs, therefore, provide an easy way for investors to diversify their portfolios further.\n\nAdvantages of bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe launch of bitcoin ETFs could change the game of crypto trading by granting retail investors a more accessible means of exposure to the crypto world. Plus, ETFs are one of the most affordable ways to decrease volatility through portfolio diversification.\n\nInvesting in bitcoin through an ETF is now the simplest, least-risky way to get exposure to the crypto market. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and the market, in general, has been riddled with fraudulent activity and scams. However, more investors can get involved in the cryptocurrency market by being regulated by the SEC and trading on the traditional exchange.\n\nThat said, it's important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (even through an ETF) is still risky. Making bitcoin accessible through an ETF won't eliminate its hyper-volatile nature. So, only investors with a high-risk tolerance should invest in bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBarton theorizes how the bitcoin ETF may impact how bitcoin is traded down the line. \"Bitcoin ETFs are more investment-based than bitcoin futures ETFs are. I believe bitcoin ETFs will be more aimed at people who will put money in and leave it in there for a few years. If that's the case, we might actually see a reduction in the volatility of the bitcoin itself.\"\n\nWhere to invest in bitcoin ETFs\n\nLike most regulated securities on the market, you can invest in bitcoin ETFs through some of the best online brokerages and investment platforms. Dozens of platforms have already submitted applications to the SEC to begin trading bitcoin ETFs, and 11 have been approved so far, including Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Hashdex, BZX, VanExk, WisdomTree, and Franklin.\n\nFidelity, one of the most popular brokerages out there, has already posted several of its proposed bitcoin ETFs on its site. There are sure to be quite a few more brokers and popular cryptocurrency exchanges jumping on the opportunity to offer bitcoin ETFs to their users in the next few weeks.\n\nIf you're interested in investing in cryptocurrencies but don't know where to start, you can always consult with a financial advisor with crypto trading experience for professional insight."

        "content": "As of Thursday morning, the Securities Exchange Commission has approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The move is widely expected to bring more legitimacy to an industry marred by the recent collapse of cryptocurrency exchanges. Several large investment firms had filed applications for ETFs with the SEC, including BlackRock, ARK Invest, Invesco and Fidelity Investments. The approved ETFs have already begun trading Thursday on traditional SEC-regulated exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. An ETF is an investment fund that tracks the price of an underlying asset or index, much like a mutual fund, and can be bought and sold through a brokerage account.\n\n\n\nFor investors, \"an ETF might be perceived as safer than a direct investment through crypto exchanges,\" says Marcel Miu, a certified financial planner and founder of Simplify Wealth Planning. \"This is primarily due to the regulatory oversight governing ETFs \u2014 they are subject to the regulatory standards of financial markets that can offer a layer of security and transparency not always present in the crypto space.\"\n\nWhat this means for you\n\nAs a result of the approvals, investors can now buy ETFs through their existing brokerage accounts instead of dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges. Plus, they don't need to own crypto directly to have a stake in the market. In the past few weeks, the price of bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies has risen in anticipation of a new crop of potential buyers. However, the price of bitcoin tumbled on Tuesday after the SEC said that an announcement posted to X about bitcoin ETFs being approved was incorrect. As of late Thursday morning, bitcoin's price has regained those losses. Still, that doesn't change the risky nature of cryptocurrencies, which are highly speculative assets. \"Investing in a bitcoin ETF carries risks, similar to investing in cryptocurrencies directly,\" says Miu. \"The value of bitcoin can be highly volatile, influenced by factors such as regulatory news, technological developments and market sentiment.\" Indeed, bitcoin lost more than 75% of its value following the collapse of FTX in 2022, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges at the time. Although it has since bounced back, it remains volatile, with 5% to 10% daily price swings common.\n\nShould you invest in a bitcoin ETF?"

The spot bitcoin ETFs are expected to begin trading on Thursday.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs will help make investing in the cryptocurrency more accessible, bringing more investors and assets into the crypto space.\n\nSpot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are cleared to begin trading Thursday after receiving regulatory approval on Wednesday from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs Approved\n\nThe regulator gave the green light to the following products:\n\nARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB)\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC)\n\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\n\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW)\n\n\n\nIn a bid to appeal to investors, many issuers slashed and offered waivers to their spot bitcoin ETF fees ahead of the SEC nod.\n\nA Long Wait for Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nIt has been a long road for the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States. The journey began in 2013 when an entity affiliated with the Winklevoss twins sent the first application for such a financial product to the SEC.\n\nWhile that application was eventually rejected, bitcoin ETFs based on futures products were eventually approved by the SEC starting in 2021. Up until now, a large number of spot-based bitcoin ETF applications had been rejected on the grounds that bitcoin's unregulated nature creates too much risk for investors. Crypto asset manager Grayscale eventually sued the SEC to force more clarity on the matter.\n\nHowever, it was Blackrock's (BLK) application for a spot bitcoin product in June last year that gathered momentum behind the idea. As the investment giant from traditional finance stepped into the arena, many others such as Fidelity and Franklin Templeton followed suit. This was seen as a sign that regulatory approval was on the way due to the firms' pivotal role in the U.S. financial system.\n\nWhile regulators and issuers went back and forth to iron out details, there were some last-minute glitches. An unauthorized post announcing the approval on social media platform X from the SEC's account on Tuesday sent bitcoin prices soaring past $48,000 before the regulator clarified that its X account had been compromised.\n\nWhat This Regulatory Approval Means for Bitcoin\n\nThe SEC's sign-off serves as a significant regulatory seal of approval for the world's largest crypto asset, likely reducing some investor fears about investing in the space. It not only brings more regulatory safeguards but allows investors to invest with well-established financial firms. But SEC Chair Gensler warned investors to consider risks before putting their money into the product.\n\n\"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\" said Gensler in a statement.\n\nUntil now, retail investors have only been able to gain cryptocurrency exposure by buying coins directly or through ETFs that trade in cryptocurrency futures. A spot bitcoin ETF will allow investors, especially retail investors, to gain access to bitcoin without needing to hold their investment in a bitcoin wallet. Instead, they simply hold the ETFs in their brokerage account.\n\n\n\nAnalysts expect significant amounts of money to flow into bitcoin spot ETFs, and that optimism has helped boost the price of bitcoin substantially in recent months.\n\nAccording to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence, the spot bitcoin ETF market could grow to $100 billion over time. Financial services provider Galaxy estimates inflows in spot bitcoin ETF products could rise from $14 billion in the first year to $39 billion within three years.\n\nUpdate\u2014Jan. 10, 2024: This article was updated to add comments from the SEC."

        "content": "US regulators have approved a new breed of financial product that will give people a way to invest in bitcoin through their brokerage for the first time, as if it were a regular stock.\n\nA selection of financial institutions, including household names like BlackRock and Fidelity, have been given permission by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), whose value tracks the price of bitcoin. The approval comes after a peculiar incident on January 9, in which a hijacker used the agency's X account to announce the ETFs prematurely, leading to market chaos and forcing the SEC to publish a retraction.\n\nThe arrival of the spot bitcoin ETFs has been celebrated among investors as a source of new demand for the asset\u2014now available in a more accessible format\u2014that could push up the price. Yet a significant portion of the financial upside will be captured behind the scenes, not in the open market.\n\nThe ETF issuers will take a management fee, as a percentage of the sum people invest. One layer deeper, though, another subset of companies\u2014intermediaries that provide the plumbing necessary for a spot bitcoin ETF to function\u2014stand to earn big. These firms are responsible for storing bitcoin on behalf of the issuers, as appointed custodians, or creating new ETF shares and cashing in existing ones, in the case of authorized participants, or APs. The job of another set of third parties, market makers, is to help price ETFs accurately and ensure that trades run smoothly in the public market.\n\nThe pool of firms that perform these trading-related functions is limited, says James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, partly because of the amount of cash required to deal with large quantities of assets flowing in and out the door. With respect to custody, the Venn diagram of willing and qualified candidates is restricted further by the challenges of handling bitcoin, which sits on entirely different technical rails than regular shares. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different area,\u201d says Seyffart.\n\nAs such, the spot bitcoin ETF issuers will share a small group of service providers, at least at launch. Between them, crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini will provide custody services for practically all the new ETFs. Only JPMorgan, Cantor Fitzgerald, Virtu Financial, and Jane Street, all multinational financial services firms, have signed on as APs to date."

        "content": "Chesnot | Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved rule changes to allow the creation of bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., a long-awaited move that will give regular investors access to the controversial and volatile cryptocurrency. The decision will likely lead to the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which holds about $29 billion of the cryptocurrency, into an ETF, as well as the launch of competing funds from mainstream issuers such as BlackRock's iShares and Fidelity. The first funds are poised to begin trading Thursday. The approval may prove to be a landmark event in the adoption of cryptocurrency by mainstream finance, as the ETF structure gives institutions and financial advisors a familiar and regulated way to buy exposure to bitcoin. \"We think that the SEC approval, should we and others get it, is a green light for institutions. We've been talking to quite a few of them, and they're much more interested now that the SEC effectively is paving the way,\" Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Monday. Ark Invest has partnered with 21Shares on a proposed bitcoin fund.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe decision comes after an official SEC social media account on Tuesday falsely said that bitcoin ETFs had been approved. The SEC said the account had been compromised. The regulator has for years opposed a so-called spot bitcoin fund, with several firms filing and then withdrawing applications for ETFs in the past. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been an outspoken critic of crypto during his tenure. However, the regulator appeared to change course on the ETF question in 2023, possibly due in part to an August loss to Grayscale in a court decision that criticized the SEC for blocking bitcoin ETFs while allowing funds that track bitcoin futures. \"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities. Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission's views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws,\" Gensler said in a statement Wednesday. Optimism around approval first reemerged this year after asset management giant BlackRock filed an application in June, leading to a flood of applications from its rivals. The partnership of Ark Invest and 21Shares has the longest active filing, and a deadline for the SEC on the fund in January led many industry experts to expect that the first bitcoin ETFs would be approved shortly after the start of 2024.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "After a false start on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday finally approved spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn a filing, the agency announced that applications for 11 issuers, including BlackRock and Grayscale, had been approved\u2014the culmination of a process that began in 2013 when the Winklevoss twins unsuccessfully sought approval for the first Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWith the SEC approving the final forms from the issuers, trading is set to begin on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moment of traditional finance finally having broad-based, convenient access vehicles,\u201d said Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets for BlackRock, in an interview with Fortune.\n\nPipe dream\n\nETFs, or exchange-traded funds, have grown in popularity over the past two decades, providing investors access to a basket of assets such as stocks or commodities that can be traded in the form of shares on major exchanges.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF, which tracks the current price of the popular cryptocurrency, had long been a pipe dream for the crypto industry, with the hope it could open new flows of investment from wealth managers and everyday traders who otherwise would not buy digital assets on exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nUnder successive administrations, the SEC rejected applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing the immaturity of the market and the potential for manipulation. Even after the agency in 2021 approved a Bitcoin futures ETF, which trades derivatives on Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2013regulated exchanges, the SEC continued to deny applications for spot ETFs.\n\nThat dynamic changed when Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager that runs the largest Bitcoin trust, sued the agency in 2022 for allowing futures-based ETFs but not spot vehicles. In anticipation of a victory, BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023\u2014a signal to many that approval was inevitable. After Grayscale won its case in August, the timeline was set in motion.\n\nThe past few months have been filled with speculation over when approval might come, as well as how the mechanics around such novel products would work. After a flurry of meetings between prospective issuers and the SEC in December, the agency pushed a cash model for creation and redemption of shares, meaning the onus for buying and selling Bitcoin would be on the issuers.\n\nFinish line\n\nAnticipating that the SEC would relent\u2014even under the crypto-skeptical chair, Gary Gensler\u2014the Bitcoin ETF race attracted major players from across the worlds of traditional finance and crypto. While BlackRock remains the highest-profile issuer, thanks to its existing fleet of ETF products, other approved firms include Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK.\n\nCrypto-native firms, hoping to entice investors by touting their experience in the digital assets space, include Grayscale, Hashdex, and Valkyrie.\n\nThe frenzy also attracted other players that aren\u2019t issuing Bitcoin ETFs but assuming related roles. Coinbase is serving as the Bitcoin custodian for the majority of issuers, while firms such as JPMorgan, Jane Street, and Virtu are set as authorized participants\u2014partners who sit in between issuers and investors to handle the creation and redemption of ETF shares.\n\nGiven the crowded field of entrants, which includes 11 newly approved issuers, firms have spent the past few weeks undercutting one another by offering reduced fees and waivers. Others have relied on marketing campaigns with flashy television ads and appeals to the crypto community. One issuer, the asset manager VanEck, pledged 5% of profits to the developers who maintain Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe next development to watch will be how much capital flows into the newly opened market, as well as which issuers capture the most market share. In a Twitter Spaces last week, Matthew Sigel\u2014VanEck\u2019s head of digital asset research\u2014claimed that BlackRock anticipated $2 billion of capital to flow into ETFs from existing Bitcoin holders alone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of hype and fascination over the approval and launch and all that, but we really think of this over a much longer time horizon,\u201d Mitchnick told Fortune.\n\nThe decider\n\nOnlookers had Wednesday circled on their calendar because it was the deadline for the SEC to approve the first issuer in line, ARK. Despite assurances of the date, shock waves rippled through the crypto world on Tuesday when a tweet from the SEC\u2019s official account announced the approval of every Bitcoin ETF application. The agency quickly clarified that its account had been hacked, with the culprit still unknown.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval on Wednesday came before the official close of market, prompting further fears of a false start\u2014especially after the initial filing disappeared from its website.\n\nThis time, the green light proved real, with Gensler posting his own statement to the SEC\u2019s website warning that the agency\u2019s approval of the ETF is not a signal that it will approve the listings of other crypto asset securities.\n\nPerhaps most surprising, in a 3-to-2 vote, Gensler, a Democrat, sided with the commission\u2019s two Republicans in voting to approve the ETFs, with the two other Democrats dissenting.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws,\u201d Gensler wrote, adding that the approval was not an endorsement of Bitcoin.\n\n\u2018Historic milestone\u2019\n\n\u201cI am happy to confirm that the Grayscale team has received necessary regulatory approvals to uplist GBTC to NYSE Arca,\u201d Jenn Rosenthal, the firm\u2019s VP of communications, wrote in a statement to Fortune shortly after the news broke.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the SEC\u2019s decision and are excited to be at the forefront of providing U.S. investors a simpler means of allocating towards digital assets,\u201d Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, said in a statement shared with Fortune after the firm\u2019s final prospectus had been approved.\n\nCrypto-friendly lawmakers also celebrated the decision, including House Financial Services Committee chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and the chair of the Digital Assets Subcommittee, French Hill (R-Ark.)\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF approvals mark a historic milestone for the future of the digital asset ecosystem in the United States,\u201d they wrote in a statement shared with Fortune."

For example, Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, which is partnering with 21Shares to launch a bitcoin ETF, initially announced a fee of 0.8% but on Monday announced no fee for the first six months.\n\nOther issuers are also steeply discounting prices, with several (Bitwise, ARK, Invesco) offering 0% fee for the first six months, while Grayscale is charging 1.5%.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF fees\n\nBitwise (BITB) 0.0% (after first six months: 0.2%)\n\nARK Invest/21Shares (ARKB): 0.0% (after first six months: 0.21%)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) 0.0% (after first six months: 0.39%)\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) 0.12% (after first 12 months: 0.25%)\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) 0.25%\n\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) 0.29%\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) 0% (after July 31, 2024, 0.25%)\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (BTCW) 0.0% (after first six months 0.3%)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) 0.0% (after three months 0.49%)\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) 1.5%\n\nHashdex Bitcoin (DEFI) 0.9%\n\nInvesco's Galaxy Bitcoin ETF has set its expense ratio at 0.0% for the initial six months and the first $5 billion in assets, and goes to 0.39% after.\n\nSource: Bloomberg/SEC.gov\n\nHow will a spot bitcoin trade relative to bitcoin and bitcoin futures?\n\nOne of the main questions is how well a spot bitcoin ETF will track bitcoin and bitcoin futures.\n\nSimeon Hyman, ProShares' global investment strategist who manages the largest bitcoin futures ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) that launched in October 2021, noted that bitcoin futures ETFs have tracked bitcoin \"fairly well.\" But he also told me, \"The spot market for bitcoin is still not mature. The futures market is regulated and mature. We'll have to wait and see how well they track against each other.\"\n\nAnother issue is whether the bitcoin ETFs will trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value. In this case, the NAV is the value of the bitcoin owned by the ETF. Some are concerned that the creation and redemption process that was agreed upon to create spot bitcoin ETFs could result in a bitcoin ETF trading at a premium to its NAV."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CB=\n\nBLK\n\nGBTC\n\nCOIN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nOmar Marques | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nIt's cheaper than ever to buy bitcoin . After 10 years of rejections, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved 11 applications for bitcoin exchange-traded funds submitted by some of the biggest asset managers in the world, including BlackRock and Fidelity. In many cases, investors will pay lower fees than they would if they bought the digital currency from a crypto exchange directly. Instead of having to go to an asset exchange such as Kraken, Binance or Coinbase to purchase and hold a token like bitcoin, traders can now turn to a so-called spot bitcoin ETF for direct exposure to the digital asset market. An ETF allows investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin through the same mechanism they already use to buy stock and bond index funds. This also eliminates the burden of managing their holdings, which typically involves maintaining a cryptocurrency wallet and cold storage to safeguard that investment.\n\nwatch now\n\nMore than 52 million Americans own crypto today, but industry participants are hopeful that the slew of approvals will draw in new retail and institutional investors who have been waiting on the sidelines until traditional financial firms offered an alternative on-ramp to crypto. \"Imagine what will happen once ETFs are introduced and widely available,\" Coinbase Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi said on the company's most recent earnings call in November. \"RIAs, retirement funds, and other institutions that have been precluded from this asset class historically will gain access to crypto for the first time, and that's very powerful.\" Prior to Wednesday's approval, the $30 trillion advised wealth management industry in the U.S. had been mostly locked out from accessing the crypto asset class.\n\nwatch now\n\nwatch now\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC , has a few favorable characteristics. Most notably, it has been trading since 2015 as a closed-end fund. \"GBTC was something of a monopoly \u2014 they had investors stuck in GBTC paying 2% fees,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar, a provider of investment research. Though approval of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs translates to increased fee competition and a way out for current GBTC investors, many traders would take a capital gains tax hit if they exited their GBTC position to purchase another ETF.\n\nwatch now\n\nWhether the appetite for spot bitcoin ETFs is overblown is another key concern among investors. Research firm Bernstein, which billed the new spot ETFs as the \"largest pipe ever built between traditional financial markets and crypto financial markets,\" expects momentum to build slowly. Analysts with JPMorgan and Mizuho have also cautioned that investor appetite might not be there. Unlike other commodities that are difficult to own directly, such as a barrel of oil or a gold bar, bitcoin is easier to own. JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to investors on Nov. 21 that they see gold ETFs as the most apt gauge for a cryptocurrency ETF outlook. \"Gold ETFs are currently 1.4% of above ground (investible) gold,\" the JPMorgan analysts wrote. \"We believe that the cryptocurrency markets are pricing in an optimistic impact from Bitcoin ETFs that is likely to fall short of expectations.\" \u2014 CNBC's Jordan Smith contributed to this report.

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin rose in volatile trading Thursday after the Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light for the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs to trade in the U.S., as expected. The cryptocurrency was last up 1% at $46,289.15, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it punched above $49,000, reaching levels not seen since December 2021. Meanwhile, the price of ether jumped 5% to May 2022 highs. It last traded at $2,594.60. The ETF approval is a landmark victory for the crypto industry, which first sought to launch a bitcoin ETF more than 10 years ago. Optimism had been building since Grayscale's big legal win against the SEC in August over the regulator's refusal to let it convert its popular Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The flagship cryptocurrency's price has increased 80% since then.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin erases earlier losses after SEC greenlights bitcoin ETFs\n\nFollowing the SEC's decision, bitcoin initially edged lower, as expected by many traders. Although the volume of inflows into the new funds remains to be seen, bitcoin ETFs are still widely expected to drive the demand \u2013 and ultimately, price \u2013 of bitcoin higher. \"I'd expect to see bitcoin bounce around,\" said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. \"In the past, when ETFs have come to market on a particular theme, one often sees a run up in the underlying asset, a sell-the-news upon launch, and then a slower and steadier rally.\" \"I wouldn't make much of these bitcoin price moves in the next couple of days, but I do think that the approval is going to lead to some longer term price appreciation,\" she added. \"Trading on an exchange, without a digital wallet, [and] custody similar to any other fund product makes bitcoin exposure far more interesting to those institutions with bullish views on the asset class.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nEther's rally propped up other coins in the Ethereum ecosystem. The token tied to Polygon gained 7%, Chainlink advanced 5% and Uniswap rose 6%. \"Now that the bitcoin ETF speculation has come to fruition it looks like traders are rotating to ether to get ahead of the next narrative, an ETH ETF, while ETH looks relatively cheap compared to most other tokens,\" said Conor Ryder, head of research at the stablecoin company Ethena Labs. The SEC is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock , Invesco , Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale, which is seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. \"It's all about getting ahead of the narratives \u2014 bitcoin has rallied versus ether for the last six months thanks to spot ETF speculation, and ETF approval ties a bow on that narrative,\" Ryder said. \"Meanwhile ETH has struggled to find any momentum and has underperformed compared to most of the smaller Layer 1s,\" or blockchain networks, like Solana and Cardano. Ether lagged bitcoin in 2023, rising just 90% compared to bitcoin's 157%."

        "content": "Representations of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are placed on a PC motherboard in this illustration taken June 16, 2023. Dado Ruvic | Reuters\n\nSt. Moritz, SWITZERLAND \u2014 Top players in the crypto industry gathered at a lavish hotel in elegant Swiss ski town St. Moritz ahead of the Wednesday start of the Crypto Finance Conference. Many were at dinners and drinks when a post from the account of the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) on the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday claimed that the long-awaited bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) had been approved. It turned out it hadn't. Instead, the SEC said its account had been compromised.\n\nThe false news was enough to send bitcoin spiking briefly before falling. It also ruined the celebrations of the crypto industry players in St. Moritz, many of who have been waiting for years for a bitcoin ETF to get past skeptics at the SEC. \"We walked into the lobby bar, right as the tweet came out, and everyone was ecstatic ... and then five minutes later after all the drinks were ordered ... very sad,\" Meltem Demirors, head of strategy at CoinShares, told CNBC on Wednesday. \"But, look, I think if you're a screenwriter, you couldn't write the narrative of this industry, it's wild, its preposterous, its crazy.\" The false post has not dampened the mood among crypto bulls, who say that new bitcoin highs are possible this year. \"I think we are going over six figures by the end of the year,\" Demirors said, highlighting two key reasons \u2014 a bitcoin ETF approval and the so-called upcoming \"halving\" event.\n\nwatch now\n\nBoth of these factors underpinned the more than 150% rally in bitcoin of last year \u2014 a rise that has continued into 2024.\n\nETFs excitement\n\nMany are excited about a bitcoin ETF, which tracks the price of the cryptocurrency and allows market participants to invest in bitcoin without actually owning the crypto. The thought is that an ETF could bring in larger and more traditional investors, who didn't want to go near cryptocurrency. \"This is a watershed moment, no question about it. It's going to usher in a lot of institutional capital, it's going to change the dynamic of this asset class completely,\" Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nwatch now\n\nCrypto execs are not expecting that the SEC social media debacle will fully derail the ETF approval. Fred Thiel, CEO of bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings, told CNBC that the SEC may \"delay\" approval, but will likely give the green light soon. \"I have a feeling that they're likely going to approve a whole slew of them and then move on,\" Thiel said. Demirors of CoinShares said that the ETFs could potentially see capital inflows of $25 billion to $100 billion in their first year of trade, coming from various areas, including the trillions of dollars in U.S. retirement funds.\n\nWhere does the bitcoin price go in 2024?\n\nThe previous all-time high of bitcoin was logged just under $69,000 in November 2021. The bitcoin price collapsed in 2022, as projects failed, bankruptcies flooded the industry and major players such as the crypto exchange and FTX faced criminal probes in the U.S. Bitcoin then rose by more than 150% in 2023, with much of that increase owed to excitement around the ETF. But bitcoin also has historically traded in cycles, which include key events called halvings \u2014 when the rewards that miners earn from mining bitcoin are slashed in half. This reduces the amount of bitcoin supply in the market and has often preceded a bull run to all-time highs. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in circulation. The next halving is due to take place in April 2024. The anticipation over ETF and the halving has caused the crypto industry to get very bullish on bitcoin this year. \"I think bitcoin will either follow its historical cycle, which would have it increase in price, achieve the prior all-time high some time toward the end of this year, then new all-time highs towards the end of next year. That's if it follows historical patterns,\" Thiel said.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "New Bitcoin ETFs Will Make it Easier to Invest in Climate Destruction\n\nWashington, DC (January 10, 2024) \u2013 In response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) from BlackRock and Fidelity, Rolf Skar, National Campaigns Director at Greenpeace USA, said, \u201cThe approval of the Bitcoin ETFs is a watershed moment in the financial services industry\u2019s embrace of polluting Bitcoin. Without substantial and measurable changes to Bitcoin mining industry practices in the near term, this presents serious challenges for our efforts to reduce carbon emissions and avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis. As Bitcoin scales, it is incumbent on BlackRock, Fidelity, and all financial institutions investing in Bitcoin, to play an active role in solving its carbon emissions problem and ensure that the mining industry makes serious efforts to rein in its use of fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cSpeculation and hype alone about a potential Bitcoin ETF based on the current, or spot, price of bitcoin that trades on traditional stock exchanges has driven up bitcoin\u2019s price. Now that the Bitcoin ETF has been approved, it will make it easier for casual and institutional investors to bet on Bitcoin. When Bitcoin\u2019s price goes up, so does its environmental impact. More electricity is used by miners competing to win more valuable Bitcoin rewards in the giant guessing game called Proof-of-Work mining. That electricity is predominantly generated by fossil fuels which leads to more carbon emissions and water use. SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a win for executives at big Wall Street companies but a loss for the climate and society.\u201d\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Senior Communications Specialist at Greenpeace USA (+1) 631-404-9977, [email protected]\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "content": "The moment the crypto world wanted finally happened Wednesday. And this time it was for real.\n\nRegulators on Wednesday gave money managers the green light to launch 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, allowing everyday investors to get exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nThe ETFs, which begin trading Thursday, could make bitcoin a potential staple in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans and give it mainstream acceptance.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission made the announcement roughly 24 hours after a fake social media post claimed those approvals had already been granted.\n\nThe chaos triggered by that unauthorized post on X reverberated from Wall Street to Washington while attracting new scrutiny to the SEC, a longtime foe of the industry that is still in the middle of a widespread crackdown on some of crypto\u2019s major players.\n\nThe price of bitcoin seesawed Tuesday and Wednesday as investors tried to make sense of the mishap, which erased tens of billions in market value in just minutes.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler made it clear in a statement Wednesday that his agency \"did not approve or endorse bitcoin\" when it signed off on the new products and called Wednesday's announcement \"the most sustainable path forward\" following a key court defeat on this issue last summer.\n\n\"Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\" he said in his statement.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. (Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nOne SEC commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw, published a dissenting opinion that called the agency's actions \"unsound and ahistorical.\"\n\n\"I am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of US households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets,\" she said in her statement.\n\nThe SEC has rejected such applications in the past, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe list of applicants approved by the SEC Wednesday included some of the biggest names on Wall Street, from BlackRock (BLK) to Franklin Templeton (BEN), as well as a number of firms better known in the crypto world.\n\nThese issuers competed with one another in the run-up to their launches to offer the lowest fees, hoping to attract as many investors as possible once ETFs begin trading.\n\nOther big Wall Street players plan to be part of the action, as well. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are among the giant banks that have offered to help some of these money managers create and redeem shares of their new funds.\n\nOptimism about these approvals helped bitcoin surge 164% in 2023 and start 2024 by rising above $47,000, its highest level in nearly two years.\n\nA decade in the making\n\nThe crypto industry has been waiting more than a decade for this moment.\n\nThe first application to create a spot bitcoin ETF came in 2013 from crypto entrepreneurs and twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, famous for their early role in the creation of Facebook.\n\nEntrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. (Lucas Jackson/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nSince then, the SEC has denied more than 30 similar applications.\n\nA key turnaround moment came last year in June when the world\u2019s biggest money manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The interest from one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest names sparked other asset managers to follow suit.\n\nAnother important development came last August when one of the ETF applicants, Grayscale Investments, won a key legal victory over the SEC. Grayscale had sued the SEC in 2022 after it wasn't allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin offering.\n\nIts core argument was that the agency had already approved exchange-traded products that held bitcoin futures contracts and thus had \"acted arbitrarily and capriciously.\"\n\nA three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington sided with Grayscale, saying the firm had \"advanced substantial evidence\" its product was similar to bitcoin futures ETFs previously approved by the SEC.\n\nThat forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF application, along with others filed by rival money managers.\n\n\"We are now faced with a new set of filings similar to those we have disapproved in the past,\" Gensler said in his statement Wednesday. \"Circumstances, however, have changed.\"\n\nOne of the applicants, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, told Yahoo Finance that the dominant providers of spot bitcoin ETFs will be those that take in the most money from investors right out of the gate.\n\nThe winners \"will be a few and it will be the most liquid,\" she said.\n\nCathie Wood, ARK Investment Management's CEO. (David Swanson/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nHistorically, launches for other bitcoin products have sent bitcoin\u2019s price on a wild ride.\n\nIt happened in 2017 with the launch of the country\u2019s first bitcoin futures contracts and then in 2021 with the SEC\u2019s approval of the first bitcoin futures ETFs. Prices soared and then fell by large amounts in the year following the launches.\n\nIn recent weeks, much debate has raged over whether bitcoin will rise or fall once the lauded moment of approval comes to pass.\n\nGautam Chhugani, managing director of the research arm for Bernstein, said his team estimates such financial products will garner $10 billion or more in investment flows through the end of 2024 and \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" over a two-year period.\n\nThat, he added, will help push bitcoin\u2019s price even higher.\n\n\"We do think that bitcoin goes to $150,000 by 2025,\" Chhugani added.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, and more related to ethereum and bitcoin prices, crypto ETFs, and market implications for cryptocurrencies\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "As many investors patiently await approval for a spot bitcoin ETF (BTC-USD) , some may still be wondering what exactly they're waiting for. Yahoo Finance Anchor Brad Smith has them covered as he explains exactly the spot bitcoin ETF is and how investors can capitalize on the opportunity.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Approvals for Spot Bitcoin ETFs need to happen today as the SEC has pushed its decision up until the deadline. And investors keeping an eager eye out for any news on the exchange traded funds. Let's delve into this with Yahoo Finance's own Brad Smith to tell us what the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are and what they mean for the market. Hey, Brad.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Hey, Rachelle. Well, yes, it's still an ETF where you've already had many commonly traded assets or baskets of securities that make up ETFs in the past. But what is the purpose for this one specifically in Bitcoin? The purpose for this one is where a fund would hold Bitcoin with the investment value proposition being for the shares that they are then listing publicly to reflect the performance of the value of a Bitcoin at a more cost effective and commonly known trading mechanism than buying cryptocurrency.\n\nSo really it just takes us back to the question of how an ETF traditionally is created and what makes this one just slightly different because of the holding a much more riskier asset or commonly thought of as that in Bitcoin? Well, how an ETF is created. You've got an ETF manager. They basically file for these plans with the SEC. We've got multiples of these, and the SEC reviewing them for now years at this point.\n\nAnd then the sponsor, they're looking for some type of agreement and an authorized participant, a market maker. The m they acquire typically stock shares previously. But in this case, they would have Bitcoin that they would be able to put into a fund. And then ultimately, they would then list that ETF and put those ETF shares up in the public market. And so they would trade just like regular stock, but it would be a basket of stocks previously. In this case, it would be a basket of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is most prominently the submission that we've seen to this point.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo to try and simplify this, at the end of the day, the ETF is still going to be listed the same. It's really just the asset that is held in the fund. And we've got multiple funds now that are putting their ETF listings forward so that people can simply just go into their registered or customary brokerage and still place a trade the same way they would if they were buying a similar or just a single stock at the end of the day.\n\nAnd so what we're going to see coming forward from the SEC is, at the end of the day, if they're able to move this forward and give and grant a lot of these permissions to move forward and list these, then you could perhaps see an inflow of people that are just more comfortable buying on their exchange or their trading platform that they already purchased through at this point, Rachelle.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I appreciate that breakdown. I remember an analyst noting that if you weren't already comfortable buying Bitcoin-- don't get overexcited and jump into the ETF if you already weren't comfortable buying Bitcoin. Appreciate that breakdown. Our very own Brad Smith."

You'll get all the latest news first by subscribing, but we will publish many (but not all) of the forecasts a few days afterward online. Here\u2019s the latest\u2026\n\nIf you think stocks have been on a tear, just look at the market for cryptocurrency, where prices soared at dizzying rates last year. What\u2019s behind this rally, and can it continue?\n\nStart with Bitcoin. It\u2019s up 69% recently, thanks to a rally that began in early October. After tumbling in 2022, the best-known digital token doubled last year. Less familiar Bitcoin alternatives rose even more. Shares in one crypto company, Coinbase Global (COIN), shot up a staggering 391% in 2023.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Financial regulators are due to decide whether to allow several Bitcoin ETFs, exchange-traded funds, that would give investors much easier access to Bitcoin via their brokerages. BlackRock, Fidelity, Wisdom Tree and Invesco are some of the sponsors hoping to launch such ETFs.\n\nThe supply of new Bitcoin is also due to slow thanks to an upcoming \u201chalving.\u201d Every four years, the algorithm that governs Bitcoin (BTC/USD) cuts the amount \u201cminers\u201d get paid to unlock new coins by half. The energy-intensive computing power miners need to solve the increasingly complex computing problems that unlock new Bitcoin could become too costly. Previous halvings led to big jumps in the currency\u2019s price.\n\nThere\u2019s also hope that cryptocurrency is shaking off its sketchy image. The frauds perpetrated by one-time crypto kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried showed the ugly side of crypto as a potential medium for ripping off na\u00efve investors. His recent prosecution, plus other legal actions against bad actors in the industry, could renew public trust.\n\nClearly, more people are buying and selling various digital coins. The number of accounts that can receive crypto has doubled over the past two years, to 15 million. And more investors with deep pockets are getting involved. Venture capital flowing into the market hit $11 billion last year and is expected to increase in 2024.\n\nAnd yet, there are plenty of reasons to be wary. Cryptocurrency is famous for booms and busts. Prices peaked in 2021, crashed in 2022, and soared again in 2023 but haven\u2019t regained their former tops. Plenty of money has been lost on that wild ride.\n\nMost crypto is still used for speculation, not as a medium of exchange, which was its original purpose. Few people buy things with crypto, and few businesses accept it as a payment option. For most users, it\u2019s more like digital gold, a new asset that offers an alternative to traditional investments and the hope of getting rich fast.\n\nYet, scams still abound, and regulation remains patchy at best. In the U.S., crypto is generally regulated under existing regulations for other products and commodities. There is no overarching, crypto-specific set of rules to create a level playing field and give investors the confidence that they truly understand how the market works.\n\nThis forecast first appeared in The Kiplinger Letter, which has been running since 1923 and is a collection of concise weekly forecasts on business and economic trends, as well as what to expect from Washington, to help you understand what\u2019s coming up to make the most of your investments and your money.

        "content": "The new year is starting off strong for crypto: Bitcoin prices are hovering around $45,000, their highest in almost two years. But can the digital currency continue to rise, or will the streak of gains it kept up through the past year peter out?\n\nThe last 12 months have seen a comeback for both bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry at large. While 2022 was fraught with controversial headlines (FTX collapse, anyone?) and price troughs, 2023 saw bitcoin values rise by over 155%. At least some of this success can be chalked up to an improving overall economy; job gains, the deceleration of inflation and the prospect of interest rate cuts this year have helped to bolster stocks, which have been shown to follow similar price patterns as cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, that's all in the past \u2014 anything can happen in 2024. Where are bitcoin prices likely to go this year? Here\u2019s what experts are saying.\n\nBitcoin ETFs and halving event cause great expectations\n\nThe biggest bitcoin-related event of the year is set to occur this spring, and experts think it could be a boon to prices. Every four years, a change to the cryptocurrency\u2019s infrastructure comes via a bitcoin halving.\n\nBitcoin is created through a mathematical process called \u201cmining.\u201d Miners use computers to solve math problems for a reward of newly minted bitcoin. When a halving event occurs, the total bitcoin reward is cut in half \u2014 meaning it then takes twice as much effort as before to earn the same number of coins. Historically, bitcoin halving events have preceded major gains; when the last one occurred in May 2020, prices rose by over 200% by the end of that year.\n\nAnother major event just happened: the long-awaited approval of a bitcoin spot ETF. These crypto-centric exchange-traded funds will allow investors to purchase a stake in bitcoin without having to directly own the asset. On Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 companies' bitcoin spot ETF applications; now, many believe these funds will bring bitcoin to the investing mainstream in a big way.\n\n\u201cETF approvals and the upcoming halving could make 2024 a record year for cryptocurrencies,\u201d says Ben Weiss, co-founder of crypto ATM provider CoinFlip. \u201cAs such, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if bitcoin breaks six figures.\u201d\n\nWeiss adds that the ETF approvals are likely to pull large investing institutions into crypto, \u201ccausing a positive feedback loop between price and demand\u201d to the benefit of investors.\n\nDan Weiskopf, co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, puts similar stock in these two events as major price determinants over the next year.\n\n\u201cWe see bitcoin reaching new highs in 2024 because of more institutional access through ETFs and a broader narrative as a store of value,\u201d Weiskopf says, adding that the halving and further regulation of the cryptocurrency industry are likely to produce positive results for investors.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s plenty of evidence out there to suggest that cryptocurrency price movements are influenced heavily by the stock market. Improving economic factors outside of crypto, then, could be good signs for bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve's policies and the broader governmental stance on monetary issues will play a significant role in shaping the crypto market landscape,\u201d says Martin Leinweber, digital assets product specialist at MarketVector Indexes.\n\nIndeed, crypto benefited during 2023 in spite of the Fed's interest rate hikes. The central bank's upcoming cuts, which would make the cost of borrowing money cheaper, could make tailwinds even stronger for speculative assets like bitcoin because they typically raise investors\u2019 tolerance for risk.\n\nAds by Money.

Learn More\n\nWhere will bitcoin prices go?\n\nAll of these factors are creating a lot of excitement among experts, but it's crucial to keep in mind that many crypto experts are perpetual optimists, especially when it comes to wider adoption of the technology.\n\nWith that in mind, the popular opinion among those interviewed seems to be that bitcoin is bound to break its record price of almost $69,000 \u2014 or go even beyond that.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a high probability that a new all-time high will be reached this year,\u201d says Bob Ras, co-creator of cryptocurrency company Sologenic.\n\nEven if the ETF approval doesn't kick off a bullish run, Ras says \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of room for bitcoin to run here.\u201d Similarly, Weiskopf says that \u201cthe previous high set of $68,000 last November 2021 will be eclipsed, and then we are off to higher round numbers.\u201d\n\nThat in itself is a bullish prediction. If bitcoin were to rise to its old all-time high by this December, it would mean a return of almost 63% on the year \u2014 six times bigger than the average S&P 500 annualized return of around 10%.\n\nThere are other, even bolder predictions being made, as well. Leinweber, for instance, has a median forecast that places the cryptocurrency\u2019s median price at $150,000.\n\nThis story was updated Wednesday afternoon to include news of the SEC's bitcoin spot ETF approval.\n\nNewsletter Make smarter money decisions in just a few minutes every day Subscribe to Daily Money to get more of the latest personal finance news, stories, and analysis delivered everyday to your inbox.

        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday the FBI is investigating the hack of the agency\u2019s social media account that rocked the bitcoin world earlier this week ahead of the regulator\u2019s approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund late Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe SEC continues to investigate the matter and is coordinating with appropriate law enforcement entities, including the SEC\u2019s Office of the Inspector General and the FBI,\u201d an SEC spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe SEC said that the \u201cunauthorized content\u201d on the agency\u2019s verified account on X (formerly known as Twitter) was \u201cnot drafted or created by the SEC.\u201d\n\nBitcoin prices briefly jumped on Tuesday after the SEC\u2019s account on X posted a message saying the regulator approved multiple bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSEC approval has been highly anticipated by crypto investors as it would help bring bitcoin further into the mainstream and make it easier for people to buy. One crypto exchange, Coinbase, even posted a celebratory message on social media Tuesday.\n\nHowever, 15 minutes later SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the agency\u2019s account was \u201ccompromised,\u201d allowing for an \u201cunauthorized\u201d tweet to get posted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that unauthorized access to SEC accounts could undermine our markets and the agency\u2019s mission,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nBrown said he expects the SEC to keep the committee updated and encouraged the Office of the SEC Inspector General to look into the incident as well.\n\nRepublican Sens. JD Vance and Thom Tillis slammed the SEC in a letter to Gensler on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that the agency entrusted with regulating the epicenter of the world\u2019s capital markets would make such a colossal error,\u201d they wrote.\n\nRegulating the regulator\n\nThe false announcement could have had huge, market-moving implications: ETFs for bitcoin could drive as much as $100 billion in investment this year if approved, said Nick Smart, director of intelligence at Crystal Blockchain.\n\nBitcoin and other digital assets experienced significant price fluctuations after the fake message was posted Tuesday: Bitcoin prices shot up by more than 2.5% before falling again as the news crossed and misinformation quickly spread across various media platforms. On Wednesday, after the SEC released its official decision to approve an ETF, the cryptocurrency rose by 0.3% to nearly $46,000, according to data on coinmarketcap.com.\n\nA spokesperson for X later said that the SEC\u2019s social media account lacked the basic security measure of two-factor authentication, raising serious questions about the agency\u2019s cybersecurity protocols.\n\nThat alleged lack of security is particularly befuddling, given the SEC\u2019s previous ruling that social media posts could serve as public announcements for investors.\n\nThe financial community is closely monitoring the SEC\u2019s response to this breach, which could lead to significant changes in how financial information is disseminated in the digital age.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nicole Goodkind"

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s official social media account on X (formerly Twitter) posted a notice on Tuesday evening falsely claiming it had approved listings for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which has since been deleted. Moments later, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a post on his own account that the agency\u2019s account was \u201ccompromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted.\u201d\n\nThe SEC followed up with a post reiterating Gensler\u2019s statement. A spokesperson for the SEC also confirmed to CNBC that an \u201cunknown party\u201d had accessed its account.\n\nLate Tuesday night, an unsigned post sent from the @Safety account said, \u201cBased on our investigation, the compromise was not due to any breach of X\u2019s systems. but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party.\u201d\n\nLast week, a report from Bleeping Computer highlighted how hackers are increasingly targeting government or business profiles on X to promote crypto scams and phishing sites. Access to these accounts, which are identifiable by their gold (for business) and gray (for government profiles) checkmarks, are even up for sale on the dark web, according to a report from the cyberintelligence company CloudSEK.\n\nMandiant, the cybersecurity firm owned by Google, was just one of the high-profile accounts that had fallen victim to hackers, as its account was hijacked last week to advertise a crypto scam that drained users\u2019 wallets. The blockchain security firm CertiK also had its account taken over earlier this week to post crypto phishing links.\n\nThe post from @Safety does not indicate X will adjust its security policies in light of these recent incidents.\n\nThe illegitimate post sent from the SEC\u2019s account said, \u201cToday the SEC grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities. The approved Bitcoin ETFs will be subject to ongoing surveillance and compliance measures to ensure continued investor protection.\u201d It included an image of Gensler next to the quote, but it was clearly missing any link to the SEC\u2019s website that would normally accompany this kind of news.\n\nScreenshot by Emma Roth / The Verge\n\nWhoever compromised the SEC\u2019s account also began liking posts from crypto-focused accounts that expressed excitement about the SEC\u2019s false approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Even though the SEC\u2019s fake post was only live for a matter of minutes, it still managed to trigger a steep spike in the price of Bitcoin that brought it from around $46,746 to $47,863. That price has since sunk to $45,633 at this time of writing, according to data from CoinDesk, though it\u2019s since risen to $46,173.\n\nCan you tell when the SEC\u2019s fake announcement went out? Screenshot by Emma Roth / The Verge\n\nExchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are bundles of assets that work sort of like mutual funds, with shares of the ETFs trading on exchanges as stocks do. A Bitcoin ETF would make it easier for investors to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without having to hold Bitcoin directly. That also lets them avoid setting up their own cryptocurrency wallets and so on. The SEC has previously rejected all attempts at a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nUpdate January 9th, 7:15PM ET: Added new information from the SEC and an updated Bitcoin price."

The SEC\u2019s X account posted a message saying the regulator had approved them, but SEC Chair Gary Gensler quickly published a message on his own X feed indicating the agency\u2019s account had been hacked.\n\n\u201cThe @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\u201d\n\nThe @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products. \u2014 Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) January 9, 2024\n\nThe SEC soon after posted a similar message on its account. Later, a spokesperson for the regulatory agency sent out the following statement: \u201cThe SEC has determined that there was unauthorized access to and activity on the @SECGov x.com account by an unknown party for a brief period of time shortly after 4 pm ET. That unauthorized access has been terminated. The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct.\u201d\n\nX said in a post that it investigated the incident. It said the SEC\u2019s account was compromised because of an \u201cunidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party.\u201d X noted the SEC did not have two-factor authentication enabled on its account \u2013 a layer of security that could prevent some kinds of unauthorized access.\n\nThe crypto community has been eagerly awaiting (and largely expecting) the SEC to finally approve the launch of bitcoin ETFs, which would make bitcoin investing more accessible to Main Street investors, without requiring them to own the digital asset directly. More than a dozen investment companies \u2014 including household names like Fidelity, BlackRock, Invesco and Franklin Templeton \u2014 have applied to offer spot bitcoin exchange-traded products for retail investors.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, notoriously volatile, didn\u2019t seem to go too wild in response to the false alarm. At 5:15 pm on Tuesday evening it was trading around $45,660 after very briefly spiking to nearly $48,000 around 4:15 pm, according to data from coinmarketcap.com. While the price has risen considerably in the past year, it\u2019s still far below its all-time high of more than $68,000 hit in 2021.\n\nSome had a good sense of humor about the false messaging, with one person posting \u201cspot bitcoin ETFs were approved for 0.07 scarmuccis [sic]\u201d - referring, of course, to the extremely short tenure of White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, who served for less than a week in the Trump administration."

        "content": "\u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin,\u201d said SEC chairman Gary Gensler, in a statement. \u201cInvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d\n\nFor the last 10 years, the SEC has denied every attempt to create a Bitcoin ETF, which is a bundle of assets that sort of works like a mutual fund. Unlike a mutual fund, though, these vehicles trade on exchanges, where stock market participants can easily buy and sell them. That\u2019s crucial here \u2014 it means, basically, you can invest in Bitcoin without the bother of setting up your own wallet.\n\nThat might be enough for certain kinds of investors who\u2019ve been sitting on the sidelines to take the plunge into cryptocurrency. Crypto investors have been frothing about this \u2014 because in order to back their funds, the companies that issue ETFs will have to buy matching amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin hardly budged on today\u2019s news. In the long run, however, a Bitcoin ETF makes it easier for traditional institutional investors to enter crypto. Pension funds and insurance funds, for instance, might be able to speculate on Bitcoin price for the first time, which would push up demand for Bitcoin.\n\nRight now, the proxy for investing in cryptocurrency has been buying shares of crypto-focused companies such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy, which owns more than $8 billion of Bitcoin as of January. The entrance of a Bitcoin ETF may make those companies less valuable.\n\nUntil recently, the SEC has rejected applications for Bitcoin ETFs, saying they aren\u2019t safe enough for investors. But last April, a court ruled that the SEC\u2019s denial of a Grayscale ETF was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d clearing the way for today\u2019s approval. An ETF of Bitcoin futures already exists, after all."

        "content": "Bitcoin prices have been soaring amid reports that spot bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) could soon hit the market.\n\nThe price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value climbed as high as $47,900 Tuesday evening after a tweet on the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) suggested the regulatory agency approved a spot bitcoin ETF. However, the SEC immediately issued a follow-up tweet that indicated its X page was hacked and that the tweet was fake. Bitcoin prices quickly turned tail.\n\nStill, Bitcoin has more than doubled over the past 12 months \u2013 effectively ending the crypto winter from 2022 \u2013 and is now trading at levels not seen in nearly two years. \"Bitcoin has stormed higher again \u2026 on the back of more ETF chat,\" says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA . \"There's clearly a lot of excitement about the prospect of a bitcoin spot ETF, as is evident by such a surge on speculation of something that was already expected to eventually get over the line.\"\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Sign up\n\nBitcoin was little changed late Wednesday after the SEC actually did approve rule changes that will allow for spot bitcoin ETFs to begin trading in U.S. markets, paving the way for institutional investors and retail traders to more easily access exposure to the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis follows a major ruling last summer from a federal appeals court that overturned the SEC's attempt to block Grayscale Investments' application for a spot bitcoin ETF. Judge Neomi Rao said the SEC's decision to approve two bitcoin future ETFs but reject the application for the spot market fund was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" This effectively paved the way for today's decision.\n\nWhat's the difference between a spot vs futures ETF?\n\nIn 2021, cryptocurrency traders scored a win when the SEC approved the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) \u2013 the first crypto ETF on the market that was not tied to stocks. The fund was so popular it accumulated more than $1 billion in assets under management by its second day.\n\nThere are plenty of other Bitcoin and crypto ETFs on the market, but none that are tied to a digital asset's spot price \u2013 or where it is trading at right now so that it can be bought for immediate delivery. This differs from futures prices, which are where the cryptocurrency is expected to be trading in the future. Futures traders buy contracts that lock in this price for a delivery of the asset at a later date.\n\nThe SEC had previously rejected approving a spot bitcoin ETF, citing risks such as market manipulation and fraud.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs will drive demand by investment advisors and wealth and private banking integrated products, as well as provide easier access to ETFs in direct broker accounts, says Gautam Chhugani , senior analyst of Global Digital Assets at Bernstein. The analyst thinks total managed crypto assets will reach $500 billion to $600 billion over the next five years, up from the current $45 billion to $50 billion.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe ruling likely won't have a negative impact on the crypto industry, says Julius de Kempenaer , senior technical analyst at Stockcharts.com. \"It opens up access to a broader group of participants which means more turnover, more adaptation and very likely in-flow from investors who so far have not taken the plunge to allocate to crypto for various reasons.\"\n\nAs for any negatives, \"the only thing I can come up with is when there would be very strict regulations, restrictions and policies attached to buying and selling the bitcoin ETFs,\" de Kempenaer adds.\n\nFollowing today's decision, spot bitcoin ETFs could start trading as soon as tomorrow, January 11. A number of firms including Grayscale, Ark Invest and Fidelity have already submitted paperwork to launch their own funds.\n\nThe high demand among asset managers is good news for investors as many issuers are cutting their fees on the bitcoin funds. Invesco, for instance, is waiving the 0.59% fee for its Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) for the six months on the first $5 billion in assets.\n\nShould I buy a bitcoin ETF?\n\n\"Bitcoin ETFs give investors a sense of security \u2013 there's a layer of protection,\" says Karim Nurani , chief strategy officer at private investing firm Linqto . \"Most people still regard cryptocurrency as a wildly volatile and unsafe asset class and they're discouraged by the complexity of self-custody and the ever-present danger of cryptocurrency hacks, scams and exploits. Having trusted financial entities provide spot bitcoin ETF mitigates these risks and responsibilities.\"\n\nInvestors may not want to rush out and scoop up shares of these new ETFs , though. At the moment, cryptocurrencies remain highly speculative and should be approached with extreme caution. For market participants interested in dipping their toes into the crypto space, it is crucial that they do their research and only use money they can afford to lose.\n\nOne benefit of buying exchange-traded funds is that they spread risk across a basket of assets. However, when it comes to crypto ETFs, this is likely more true for funds that are made up of stocks vs those that are tied to futures or spot prices of a digital currency."

        "content": "In this article COIN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nBrian Armstrong, chief executive officer of Coinbase Global Inc., speaks during the Messari Mainnet summit in New York, on Thursday, Sept. 21, 2023. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nNow that the SEC has approved the creation of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, Coinbase's position in the crypto market is poised to take a dramatic turn. In the weeks ahead, Coinbase will help shepherd some of the biggest names in asset management, including BlackRock , Franklin Templeton, and WisdomTree, into the digital asset ecosystem as their custodial partner of choice. That means Coinbase will be central to the storage and safekeeping of the assets for those firms. While custody revenue presents a big growth opportunity for Coinbase in the near term, some industry analysts are concerned that the company's core transaction business is at risk due to the myriad ways investors will be able to access bitcoin. Instead of having to go to an asset exchange such as Kraken, Binance, or Coinbase, they'll be able to invest in the digital currency through the same mechanism they already use to buy stock and bond ETFs. In a report Dec. 4, analysts at Bernstein predicted that in less than five years, 10% of the global supply of the world's largest cryptocurrency, or roughly $300 billion, will be managed by ETFs. The firm called it the \"largest pipe ever built between traditional financial markets and crypto financial markets.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nIn 2023, Coinbase's stock was one of the top performers in the tech industry, soaring almost 400%. Much of that rally was tied to bitcoin, which increased 150%. But part of the outperformance relative to bitcoin was due to the excitement that new ETFs would drive more interest in crypto and be a boon for Coinbase. \"ETFs should expand the pie and bring new people and institutions into the cryptoeconomy,\" Coinbase Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi said on the company's most recent earnings call in November. \"They should add credibility to the market, and we should see increased liquidity and market stability as we've seen with other asset classes such as gold.\" From June 15, the day that BlackRock \u2014 with its $9 trillion in assets under management \u2014 filed for a so-called spot bitcoin ETF and named Coinbase its crypto custodian, shares in the exchange rose from around $54 to over $170 by the end of the year.\n\nwatch now\n\nJPMorgan analysts wrote in a November report that Coinbase would be a key beneficiary of the coming ETF boom, given the immediate upside of custody fees from asset managers. \"We estimate Bitcoin custody and surveillance revenue will more than offset decline in Bitcoin trading volume as assets migrate to ETFs,\" the analysts said. Some of the momentum on Wall Street has faded to start 2024, with the stock down 14% since the calendar turned. According to Mizuho analysts, there could be more pain to come. \"With the hype around Bitcoin ETFs likely to reach a climax in the coming weeks, COIN bulls could experience a rough awakening when they realize how minimal the revenue impact is,\" Mizuho wrote in a note Thursday. Mizuho's analysts have the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock and were bearish throughout last year's rally, finishing 2023 with a $54 price target, by far the lowest among analysts tracked by FactSet.\n\nThe battle for market share\n\nAlmost half of Coinbase's revenue comes from the fees it charges on transactions, meaning the company needs people to keep using the exchange to buy and trade bitcoin and other digital currencies. In the third quarter in 2023, total transaction revenue accounted for 46% of net revenue. However, Coinbase has been diversifying into new businesses. In 2022, transactions made up closer to 75% of revenue. More than one-quarter of Coinbase's revenue in the third quarter came from interest income on the exchange's stablecoin reserves, including Circle's U.S. dollar-pegged USDC coin. Stablecoin revenue more than doubled from a year earlier primarily due to rising interest rates.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"A few years ago, our business at Coinbase was 95% trading fees, and we made a big effort around the time it went public to start diversifying our revenue,\" CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in a recent interview. \"What's great is that now we have multiple sources of revenue \u2014 some of them in a high interest rate environment go up, some of them in a low interest rate environment go up.\" Still, transaction fees remain a key income driver for the exchange. And unlike trading platform Robinhood , which enables investments in a wide array of asset types, Coinbase doesn't allow for trading of ETFs. \"Spot bitcoin ETFs appear poised to take volume away from crypto exchanges,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. JPMorgan anticipates that new account growth will slow as \"novice crypto investors get their initial exposure and possibly final exposure through ETFs rather than Coinbase,\" adding that many of these neophyte traders will never go beyond bitcoin, \"thus never needing the services of a Coinbase.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nMizuho sees the income from custody fees as fairly modest given how far investors have pushed up the stock. The firm predicts ETF approval may add just $25 million to $30 million in annual custody fees, with another $200 million to $210 million of new revenue \"if incremental Bitcoin inflows generate additional spot trading opportunities.\" With a collective gain of up to $240 million in additional annual revenue, \"this represents just mid-to-high single-digit percentage upside vs. current 2024 consensus,\" the Mizuho analysts wrote. They said they \"do not believe the nearly 400% increase in the stock in anticipation of ETF approval justifies our reasonable estimate for the ETFs' actual contribution to revenue.\" A Coinbase spokesperson told CNBC in an emailed statement that, in addition to custody fees, the company will make money by providing services such as agency trading, matching and settlement, and financing to ETF issuers.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The platform believes that spot ETFs will be a positive catalyst for the entire crypto space, adding credibility, increasing liquidity, and bringing new participants and institutions into the cryptoeconomy,\" the spokesperson said, reiterating prior comments from Coinbase executives. Competition could also create pricing pressure. ARK, Invesco, Fidelity, WisdomTree, and Valkyrie are all offering deals that involve fee-free trading for a certain period of time. Others are opting for discounted fees. Coinbase's transaction fee varies, with a max of 0.6% on transactions up to $10,000 in value. In the company's most recent quarterly earnings call, Choi said that Coinbase doesn't plan to reduce transaction fees to make them more competitive with other platforms where ETFs are being traded at significantly lower prices.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe transaction charges on Coinbase also vary between its Pro platform and the retail app, where fees are higher. For retail transactions up to $1,000, the fee ranges from 1.5% to 3%. However, JPMorgan analysts said greater efficiency and transparency in equity markets, paired with lower costs to execute, could drive more cryptocurrency trading to ETFs over time, which could ultimately \"pressure Coinbase to lower commissions and to narrow trading spreads, reversing the multi-quarter increase we've witnessed in Coinbase's retail revenue capture.\" Still, Coinbase has its believers among crypto enthusiasts, such as Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures. \"They are essential infrastructure in terms of custody, trading, and surveillance for the majority of the ETF proposals,\" Carter said. \"Even though it might affect their fees at the margin I think they are still winners here.\" WATCH: Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton on changes in bitcoin trading"

After a landmark victory in August by crypto firm Grayscale, one of the prospective issuers for the Bitcoin ETF, in a lawsuit against the agency, the SEC began to reconsider the applications, which now included major players including BlackRock.\n\nEven after Gensler\u2019s retraction, the SEC is likely to approve the applications as soon as Wednesday, when it is required to issue a decision for one of the prospective issuers, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK.\n\nTwitter blew up with speculation over whether the errant tweet was the result of a scheduling error or a hack.

The SEC account also appeared to tweet out \u201c$BTC\u201d and delete it right before its fake approval post.\n\nOthers pointed out the irony that the long-dreaded market manipulation seemed to come from the SEC itself, or at least its cybersecurity practices. \u201cI expect @SECGov Enforcement to send the SEC\u2019s Social Media and Cybersecurity teams a Wells Notice any minute,\u201d wrote Gemini cofounder Tyler Winklevoss, who is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with the agency.\n\nThe initial X post claiming the ETFs had been approved was deleted about 25 minutes after it went up."

In a post late Tuesday night, the X safety team wrote it had conducted a \"preliminary investigation\" and determined the compromise was \"not due to any breach of X's systems, but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party.\"\n\nThe SEC \"did not have two-factor authentication enabled at the time the account was compromised,\" the X safety team wrote.\n\nThe SEC is widely expected to give the green light this week for a number of financial firms to offer spot bitcoin ETFs, including industry giants BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Franklin Templeton. The approvals could spur investment in bitcoin and bolster cryptocurrency industry, pouring billions of dollars into the turbulent digital assets market, according to experts.\n\n\"Either @secgov was hacked, or @garygensler was hacked, or the SEC just bungled their own announcement. All 3 possibilities are the same - the SEC was responsible for this one,\" Mike Belshe, CEO of crypto custodian Bitgo, said in a post on X.\n\nThe price of bitcoin jumped from $46,730 to nearly $48,000 after the false bitcoin ETF news surfaced, and then dropped to roughly $45,000 following the SEC's denial that it had approved the investments, according to CoinDesk Indices' bitcoin price tracker.\n\nIt remains unclear how the SEC's social media accounts became compromised. The SEC appeared to have regained control of its account shortly after Gensler's statement on the hack.\n\nThis isn't the first time there has been phoney information about the future of bitcoin. A false report back in October implied that fund manager BlackRock had gotten approval for a bitcoin ETF, causing bitcoin prices to surge.\n\n\u2014The Associated Press contributed to this report."

        "title": "Bitcoin swings sharply after false claim that SEC approved ETFs - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nPrices of cryptocurrencies swung sharply on Tuesday after a false post on the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s official X account claimed the regulator had approved the first-ever US spot bitcoin exchange traded funds.\n\nThe fake post declared just after 4pm Washington time that the SEC \u201cgrants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges\u201d. It was picked up immediately on social media, business news websites and Bloomberg TV.\n\nJust over 10 minutes later, the SEC chair poured cold water on the announcement. Gary Gensler posted on his personal account on X: \u201cThe @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\u201d\n\nAn SEC spokeswoman said the original post \u201cwas not made by the SEC or its staff\u201d. By 5pm SEC staff had regained control of the X account and the false post had been deleted.\n\n\u201cThe SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct,\u201d the SEC said, attributing the unauthorised access to \u201can unknown party.\u201d\n\nIn a post from an official account late Tuesday, X said its initial investigation indicated \u201cthe compromise was not due to any breach of X\u2019s systems, but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party.\n\n\u201cWe can also confirm that the account did not have two-factor authentication enabled at the time the account was compromised,\u201d the post stated, referring to an added layer of cyber security beyond a password. \u201cWe encourage all users to enable this extra layer of security.\u201d\n\nBitcoin rallied immediately after the post, for a 1.5 per cent gain on the day, but swiftly reversed on confirmation that the news was fake and the price slid as much as 3.4 per cent.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts are on tenterhooks as the SEC is expected to decide later this week whether to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, in what would be a watershed moment for the digital asset.\n\nAt least 11 asset managers have applications pending before the SEC to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. The SEC faces a deadline of Wednesday to approve some of the applications.\n\nAlthough the watchdog has previously resisted such products, it now has less room for manoeuvre. A federal appeals court last year ruled that the SEC\u2019s rejection of an application filed by Grayscale to convert its $29bn bitcoin trust into such an ETF was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d.\n\nSo far this year, the volatile cryptocurrency has gained about 7 per cent on hopes the SEC would grant approval.\n\nSeveral applicants have said they received feedback from commission staff indicating that approval was possible this week.\n\nThe applicants range from large asset managers BlackRock, Invesco and Franklin Templeton to smaller firms such as Ark Investment Management and Bitwise. Earlier this week, the firms disclosed fees for their prospective products, with several of the hopefuls either substantially cutting their fees or agreeing to waive them altogether shortly after inception.\n\nThe SEC has long argued that spot bitcoin ETFs cannot guarantee the same level of protection to investors as traditional investment products. Gensler on Monday posted a short thread on X outlining potential drawbacks to investing in cryptocurrency products, noting that issuers \u201cmay not be complying (with) applicable law\u201d and that crypto investments \u201ccan be exceptionally risky (and) are often volatile\u201d.\n\nETFs hold assets like mutual funds but trade on exchanges like stocks and usually enjoy preferential tax treatment in the US. Each of the pending ETFs are meant to invest solely in bitcoin, an evolution over previous products that invest in cryptocurrency futures or companies involved in the crypto industry.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hannah Murphy"

        "title": "\u2018Bitcoin Rodney\u2019 Pushed Crypto With Jamie Foxx and Rick Ross. Now He\u2019s Under Arrest - Rolling Stone",
        "content": "This article was produced in collaboration with Court Watch, an independent outlet that unearths overlooked court records.\n\nThe dream of making a quick and easy fortune in cryptocurrency took yet another hit on Friday with the arrest of Rodney Burton, a.k.a. \u201cBitcoin Rodney,\u201d a relentless promoter who sold himself as a high-tech financial guru and was often seen out with celebrity pals including Jamie Foxx, Rick Ross, Marlon Wayans, and Tiffany Haddish.\n\nBurton, whose 2021 \u201cReinvent Yourself With Crypto\u201d event in Miami also included appearances by singer Akon, FUBU founder and Shark Tank regular Daymond John, and convicted fraudster Jordan Belfort (whose memoir The Wolf of Wall Street inspired the Martin Scorsese film), was taken into custody in Florida and is awaiting transfer to Maryland, where he\u2019s being charged. The criminal complaint that was filed rests on an affidavit by a special agent of the IRS who found probable cause to believe that one of the crypto operations that Burton was involved in was an \u201cunlicensed money transmitting business.\u201d Burton is accused, in short, of illegal transfer of currency \u2014 but the broader accusations in the legal filing paint a picture of a pyramid scheme operated by several people, including Burton. (Burton did not respond to requests for comment through social media or his public defender.)\n\nThe statement describes Burton\u2019s role in advising people to invest in HyperVerse (previously called \u201cHyperfund\u201d), a purported decentralized finance crypto investment platform established in 2020, alongside two other HyperVerse promoters unnamed in the document (\u201cIndividual 1\u201d and \u201cIndividual 2\u201d). The IRS special agent alleges that this entity made \u201cfraudulent promotional presentations to investors and potential investors.\u201d Touted as the \u201cworld\u2019s most sustainable passive rewards program,\u201d HyperVerse sold investor \u201cmemberships\u201d that promised double or triple returns \u2014 up to one-percent daily \u201crewards,\u201d paid for in part using \u201clarge-scale crypto mining operations.\u201d But it had no mining capability, and, according to the charging document, the investors \u201cwere paid with funds collected from more recent investors.\u201d The fund collapsed in mid-2023, costing consumers approximately $1.3 billion. (Last week, a Guardian investigation found that its CEO, Steven Reece Lewis, \u201cdoes not appear to exist,\u201d though HyperVerse\u2019s founders gave no comment for the story.) Editor\u2019s picks\n\nNeither Burton nor the Southern District of Florida Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office, which is currently representing him, responded to requests for comment from Rolling Stone, and no others have been arrested in connection with HyperVerse to date. The fund was created by Zijing \u201cRyan\u201d Xu of China and Xue \u201cSam\u201d Lee of Australia, two other crypto entrepreneurs whose Blockchain Global crypto exchange platform ACX.io imploded in 2019, with creditors still owed around $50 million. Blockchain Global itself collapsed in 2021 and entered voluntary administration.\n\nHyperVerse was run as what various financial regulators around the world warned was a potential pyramid scheme, and that\u2019s what seems to be presented in the charging documents: members invested money that was converted into \u201cHyperUnits,\u201d or HU, that could then be withdrawn and converted into Tether, a so-called \u201cstablecoin\u201d that was established in 2014, whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar and can easily be converted to fiat currency. Investors were also encouraged to reinvest what they made and refer new customers for commission fees. According to the charging statement, Burton, on at least several occasions, paid \u201crewards\u201d to investors out of his own HyperVerse account.\n\nAccording to the IRS investigator who wrote Burton\u2019s charging document, \u201cbeginning in at least July 2021 HyperFund began blocking investors\u2019 ability to convert HU to cryptocurrency.\u201d Yet Burton continued to accept checks and wire transfers from customers through early 2022, the affidavit states, and took in $5,833,562 in these transactions, even though HU was by then effectively worthless. Burton, the filing says, also instructed Individual 1 to ask customers for wire transfers or checks with the inaccurate memo line \u201cConsultation/Training\u201d to avoid scrutiny from banks. Furthermore, the entities he used to conduct these transactions failed to register a money transmitting business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as required by the U.S. Treasury, per the IRS agent. Related\n\nAfter Burton\u2019s initial court appearance, the government moved to reseal his criminal complaint, possibly indicating that other defendants are to be charged in connection with HyperVerse.\n\nBurton has cut a flashy figure in the crypto world, wearing crypto-themed clothes and jewelry, buying designer cars with Bitcoin, throwing yacht parties, apparently commissioning his own rap anthem, and earning shoutouts for his business acumen by the likes of Rick Ross, who in 2022 said Burton was \u201cgetting real money\u201d compared to \u201cfake-rich\u201d crypto hustlers. This high life has extended to hobnobbing with other celebrities, including Jamie Foxx and music mogul Breyon Precott. In recent years, the likes of Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, Tom Brady, Jimmy Fallon, Soulja Boy, Lil Yachty, Kim Kardashian, and Floyd Mayweather have all faced lawsuits and SEC charges for their roles in promoting crypto, in some cases allegedly failing to disclose that they were paid to do so. Most of those suits have already been settled, while Kardashian paid an SEC fine of about $1.3 million in 2022. Burton\u2019s most famous supporters, however, do not appear to have directly endorsed his HyperVerse venture.\n\nIn addition to his consulting services, investment tutorials, and event appearances, Burton\u2019s website also advertises an AI-powered crypto trading platform. Yet another link plugged on Burton\u2019s Instagram profile redirects to a cannabis lifestyle site called Cannaglobe. Burton appears to be the name behind the Cannaglobe product \u201cRyz,\u201d a \u201csexual enhancer breath refresher\u201d that costs $99.99.\n\nIn a November 2021 interview on the popular morning radio show The Breakfast Club, Burton said he\u2019d discovered crypto investing in 2017 and had been passionate about it ever since. Asked by host Angela Yee why people might suspect a crypto opportunity of being a \u201cscam,\u201d Burton replied that not every investment he\u2019s made has been \u201con the up and up.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of these deals I\u2019ve made money, some of these deals I failed miserably,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I\u2019m doing so well now, it\u2019s because I know exactly what to look for.\u201d He also acknowledged that USI Tech, one of the first crypto platforms he promoted, was a Ponzi scheme \u2014 it collapsed in April 2018, with tens of millions of dollars vanished \u2014 claiming that he didn\u2019t recognize it as such because he was still new to the field.\n\n\u201cI always tell everyone, make sure you have a coach, instructions, direction before you go there and do it, because you can lose everything you made, or earned in life, in crypto,\u201d Burton said."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission said it has approved proposals for 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on an accelerated basis, in a document that was uploaded to the SEC website.\n\nThe document lists 11 spot bitcoin ETFs by Bitwise, Grayscale, Hashdex, BlackRock, Valkyrie, BZX, Invesco, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity and Franklin.\n\n\"After careful review, the Commission finds that the Proposals are consistent with the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,\" the document states.\n\nThe document notes that fraud or manipulation that would impact prices in spot bitcoin markets would likely impact bitcoin futures prices in similar ways. This is a nod to the recent court case that found the SEC acted in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner when rejecting Grayscale's earlier bid to pivot GBTC to an ETF.\n\n\u201cI am happy to confirm that the Grayscale team has received necessary regulatory approvals to uplist GBTC to NYSE Arca, and we will share a press release with additional information shortly,\u201d said a Grayscale spokesperson.\n\nAfter the document was first picked up, it quickly went to a 404 error. A short while later it appeared in the correct part of the SEC website and the SEC told The Block that the filing was accurate.\n\nAlongside the omnibus approval order, the SEC published a speech by Chair Gary Gensler. He confirmed the approvals but added a warning. \"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\" he said.\n\nWhile the document approves the issuers' 19b-4 forms all in one go, they will still need their S-1 forms to be effective for trading to start.\n\nEarlier today, the Cboe BZX exchange sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, requesting \u201cacceleration of registration\u201d for proposed spot bitcoin ETFs. A few hours later, it issued listing notifications for six prospective ETFs saying that trading would begin on Thursday. This was prior to any approvals by the SEC.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nPotential inflows\n\nOnce trading gets underway, these products could see large inflows. Valkyrie Investments co-founder and CIO Steven McClurg said he expects $200 million to $400 million of investors\u2019 funds coming to Valkyrie\u2019s ETF, and all participants might see $4 to $5 billion of inflows over the first couple of weeks.\n\nVanEck estimated that $1 billion of funds would arrive in the first few days, and $2.4 billion within a quarter. Galaxy expects $14 billion within the first year. Bitwise said it anticipated the market for spot bitcoin ETFs to reach around $72 billion within five years.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SEC\u2019s X account was compromised and a post went out claiming the SEC had granted approval for listing bitcoin ETFs on all registered securities exchanges with an image showing a quote by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. It was shortly deleted with follow up posts claiming it was unauthorized and that spot bitcoin ETFs had not been approved by that point.\n\nPreparing for spot bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe issuers have also lined up seed funding for their products. VanEck has taken the lead with direct investment, noting that it has seeded its potential spot bitcoin ETF with $72.5 million. Bitwise has seeded its proposed ETF with $500,000, according to its amended S-1 form, but Pantera Capital has also said that it is interested in putting $200 million into the fund if approved. BlackRock has seeded its potential spot bitcoin ETF with $10 million.\n\nPrior to approval, the ETF applicants had been waging a war for who can offer the lowest fees. Bitwise went the lowest, with zero fees for the first six months or until $1 billion of assets, and 0.2% afterward \u2014 which it lowered from 0.24% just days before. BlackRock maintained its offering of a discounted 0.2% for the first 12 months or until the fund hits $5 billion in assets, and 0.3% from then on. Other fees range up to 1.5% at the highest.\n\n\n\nUpdate: This article has been updated with additional information. The headline was amended for clarity.\n\n"

        "title": "The SEC just approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Here's what investors should know. - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday granted approval to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, backed by Wall Street, a key regulatory step expected to drive significant investment in the digital currency.\n\nThe agency gave the green light to multiple financial firms to offer spot bitcoin ETFs, including asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Franklin Templeton that cater to retail investors. Until now, only bitcoin futures ETFs had SEC approval. Bitcoin prices have shot up on the SEC's approval of the ETFs, more than doubling since last year, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index shows. Prices for the cryptocurrency had already risen 61% since October on expectations that the SEC planned to grant approval of spot ETF applications, CoinDesk reported.\n\nHere's what to know about spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhat's an ETF?\n\nETFs are pooled investments, like a mutual fund, but that trade on stock exchanges like a stock or bond and that track a specific index, sector or asset class.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF. Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs vs. buying bitcoin: What's the difference?\n\nInvesting in spot bitcoin ETFs differs from buying bitcoin directly in a few ways.\n\nFirst, investors who put money into bitcoin ETFs do not own any bitcoin outright, Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, told CBS MoneyWatch. Second, financial firms will charge fees for trading and managing a bitcoin ETF. By contrast, people who buy bitcoin directly pay a transaction fee, but there are no costs for managing the investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are some advantages to owning bitcoin through an ETF. For example, investors can hold and track their bitcoin ETF in the same brokerage account as their other investments.\n\nWhat could be the impact of the SEC approving bitcoin ETFs?\n\nInvestors are betting that the emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs will pump billions of dollars into the digital currency by making it easier and less intimidating to invest.\n\nFirms like BlackRock and Fidelity are household names in financial services, and their move to enter the sector nudges bitcoin further into the mainstream as an investment class while conferring some some legitimacy to the shadowy and highly volatile crypto industry. And as demand for bitcoin rises, so too will its price, likely spurring even more investment and interest in crypto, experts say.\n\nIncreasing investment in bitcoin, coupled with the introduction of new products from reputable financial players, could also accelerate passage of sensible regulations aimed at eliminating fraud and normalizing crypto as a way to invest, make payments and more generally conduct business."

        "title": "Fake bitcoin post shows SEC crypto quandary - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe prospect of bitcoin exchange traded funds leaves cryptocurrencies teetering on the cusp of mainstream respectability. A fake post this week claiming regulatory approval again illustrates the proliferation of crypto scams. It is certainly an argument against using social media for market-moving announcements. But it is unlikely to derail the funds.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission was forced to refute a post on its X account that claimed it had approved the listing of spot bitcoin ETFs. Gary Gensler, SEC chair, used the platform to clarify that the SEC\u2019s account had been \u201ccompromised\u201d. The price of bitcoin, which had jumped 2 per cent, promptly fell more than 3 per cent.\n\nCrypto purists envisage a decentralised financial world without tedious oversight from governments and regulators. More pragmatic bitcoin holders see regulators as the key to larger digital asset markets and thus higher prices.\n\nThe prospect of regulatory approval for bitcoin ETFs has already bolstered prices, counteracting the negative effects of scandals such as the collapse of stablecoin Terra and crypto platform FTX. At $45,525 the price is up by more than 150 per cent in the past 12 months, though it remains a third below the all-time high. One analyst at Standard Chartered predicts SEC approval of bitcoin ETFs could send it as high as $100,000.\n\nInvestors who have followed the SEC\u2019s concerns about market manipulation and its attempt to reject bitcoin ETFs may steer clear. Another dubious attempt to juice prices plays into sceptics\u2019 concerns.\n\nBut the regulator\u2019s hand is in effect being forced: it lost a court case against Grayscale Investments, which wants to convert a bitcoin trust into an ETF. The ruling noted the similarity between existing ETFs trading in bitcoin futures and potential spot bitcoin ETFs. Fidelity, BlackRock and Ark Investment Management are already competing on fees, despite spot products not yet being available. If the SEC gives the nod, expect these to be available in a matter of days.\n\nGensler has made his concerns clear, outlining the case against investment in crypto including fraudulent schemes and volatility. But the US \u2014 and the regulator \u2014 is hampered by the failure to agree the sort of overarching rules that Europe and the UK are putting in place. Europe\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation aims to reduce the likelihood of scams in part by requiring users to supply identifying information.\n\nCrypto-curious US investors who hope mainstream products will safeguard their money may be disappointed. Without drastic change, it is not obvious that regulators can solve the problems inherent in a system that prizes anonymity."

        "title": "With the fake Bitcoin ETF approval, Gary Gensler created his own worst nightmare - Fortune",
        "content": "Proof of State is the Wednesday edition of Fortune Crypto where Leo Schwartz delivers insider insights on policy and regulation.\n\nSometimes I struggle to find a meme to feature at the bottom of this newsletter. Today was not one of those days.\n\nAfter weeks of frenzied reporting and anticipation, everyone seemed to settle on Wednesday as the finish line for the great Bitcoin ETF scramble, with Gary Gensler\u2019s SEC likely approving some\u2014if not all\u2014of the applications for the long-awaited financial vehicle at the close of markets.\n\nWe were all taken by surprise when the SEC Twitter/X account instead posted yesterday at 4:11 pm that it had granted approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, with gleeful accompanying posts from the biggest accounts on Crypto Twitter announcing that every single application\u2014including the SEC nemesis Grayscale\u2014had been given the green light.\n\nIt all seemed too good to be true. In the aftermath, I spoke with one prospective issuer who told me they were immediately dubious. They were expecting to receive word from their listing exchange partner after the SEC moved its 19b-4 from pending to approved, or else they would get a call from SEC staff granting an order of effectiveness on its S-1. It\u2019s the kind of mind-numbing bureaucratic legalese that has permeated this process, but ultimately reflects that its conclusion is unlikely to take place on a social media platform run by Elon Musk. After the SEC had followed all of the correct procedures for months, it just didn\u2019t feel right, the issuer told me. \u201cThat was my gut,\u201d they said.\n\nSo what happened? The Fortune newsroom looked like a scene out from an Oscar-bait movie about a bygone era, with my editors and myself shouting back and forth across cubicles about whether the Twitter account had been \u201ccompromised,\u201d as Gensler\u2019s Twitter account soon announced, or hacked. In other words, did some poor staff member set the wrong day when they scheduled a Tweet, or had someone gotten access to a key governmental social media account?\n\nAs the smoke has cleared, the latter seems most likely, although conspiracies will continue to swirl. Around 6:32 pm, an SEC spokesperson emailed reporters that there was \u201cunauthorized access and activity\u201d on its Twitter account, which had been terminated, and that it was working with law enforcement to investigate what happened.\n\nA few hours later, the \u201cSafety\u201d account for Twitter\u2014if there is such a thing anymore\u2014reiterated the assertion, posting that an \u201cunidentified individual\u201d had seized the SEC account by obtaining control over a phone number associated with the account through a third party. It included a cheeky reminder for users to enable two-factor authentication, which the SEC apparently had not done.\n\nAs many have pointed out on Twitter, the real upshot of the episode is a pervading sense of irony. For years, the SEC has cited market manipulation as a reason not to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, which would grant investors the ability to trade the popular cryptocurrency in the form of shares on major exchanges. On the eve of its approval, spurred by the agency losing a landmark court case against Grayscale, the SEC is the one who fell victim to manipulation, with the tweet spurring $90 million in liquidations due to Bitcoin price volatility.\n\nAs always, observers will view the scandal as a Rorschach test and retreat to their tribal corners. Crypto critics are claiming this is evidence that crypto is too immature to handle an ETF, while advocates\u2014including prominent lawmakers\u2014are taking the opportunity to escalate their denunciation of Gensler\u2019s SEC.\n\nThe only thing we can all agree on is that this is another embarrassing misstep for Gensler in the Bitcoin ETF circus. As Georgetown finance professor James Angel astutely pointed out in Capitol Account, all the SEC has done with its drawn-out process of litigation and approval is to create a marketing cyclone for the financial vehicle, which otherwise could have just been a niche way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. While the agency\u2019s laborious approach, such as working with issuers on the mechanics of cash vs. in-kind creates and redemptions, is no doubt constructive, it has also invited a degree of scrutiny and attention that seems wholly unnecessary.\n\nThe latest scandal is just the cherry on top. You can bet that if the SEC finally grants issuers the green light tonight, it won\u2019t be on Twitter.\n\nLeo Schwartz\n\nleo.schwartz@fortune.com\n\n@leomschwartz\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nThe once-prolific trading firm Jump has largely retreated from the crypto industry, including sitting out the recent Bitcoin ETF frenzy.

        "content": "It was the moment that the crypto world had been waiting for. Then it wasn't.\n\nThe price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) soared to nearly $48,000 Tuesday afternoon after the Securities and Exchange Commission appeared to announce on X, formerly Twitter, that the regulator had granted approval for the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe SEC had been expected this week to rule on whether as many as 14 different money managers would be allowed to issue the ETFs, which would allow everyday investors to get exposure to bitcoin without having to own it.\n\nFifteen minutes later, SEC Chair Gary Gensler declared that message to be both \"unauthorized\" and inaccurate. In his own message on X, Gensler said the SEC's account on that platform had been \"compromised\" and that \"an unauthorized tweet was posted.\"\n\n\"The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products,\" he added.\n\nThe price of the world's largest cryptocurrency fell back to $45,500, losing $63 billion in market value over just a matter of minutes.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson said shortly after the incident that the unauthorized public message on X \"was not made by the SEC or its staff.\"\n\nThe agency offered more explanation hours later, saying in a statement that it determined there had been unauthorized access on the agency's @SECGov X account \"by an unknown party for a brief period of time shortly after 4 pm ET\" and that the unauthorized access \"has been terminated.\"\n\n\"The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct.\"\n\nThe @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted.

A number of major platforms & crypto assets have become insolvent and/or lost value. Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk.\"\n\n2\u20e3 Investments in crypto assets also can be exceptionally risky & are often volatile.

        "content": "Key Takeaways The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to approve the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) this week.\n\nThe world's top cryptocurrency by market capitalization that would be traded in the new ETFs surged more than 100% in 2023 and analysts see large bitcoin investment inflows for in 2024.\n\nETF providers are sharing their proposed fee structures for these new bitcoin instruments as competition heats up, and several are waiving or offering lower-than-usual fee structures.\n\nThe widely expected approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) this week has sparked competition among providers, with some waiving fees until they see strong investor adoption.\n\nBlackRock (BLK), VanEck, ARK Investment Management LLC, and Bitwise Asset Management Inc., are among the firms hoping to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, and their recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings show that they are planning to undercut the average market rate for ETF investor fees in the U.S.\n\nBitwise on Tuesday lowered the bar with disclosure of a planned 0.20% management fee for its spot bitcoin ETF, compared with the 0.37% average for existing U.S. ETF products and mutual funds in 2022, the latest data available, according to Morningstar Inc. investment research data. Given that all ETFs track bitcoin, the fees they charge could help investors set them apart.\n\nBitwise is followed by VanEck, and ARK Invest's 21Shares with planned 0.25% ETF expense fees, and BlackRock is set to charge 0.30%. BlackRock added fuel to a rally in bitcoin last year after it submitted its bitcoin ETF application.\n\nThe SEC has until Wednesday to decide on the first spot bitcoin ETF application, and a Bloomberg ETF analyst said the chance of rejection by the regulator has fallen to just 5%.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts are hopeful that a Bitcoin spot ETF will lead to an increase in institutional and retail investor adoption. Investment bank Standard Chartered Monday said in a research note that it expects investment flows of $50 billion to $100 billion in 2024 alone once an ETF is approved.\n\nETF providers are hungry for potential investment inflows and have heated up the fee arms race with waiver periods. Bitwise said it would waive fees for new spot bitcoin ETFs for the first $1 billion invested for its fund's first six months, while BlackRock set a waiver period of 12 months or the first $5 billion invested. The 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, released in partnership with ARK Invest, said its waiver would be for six months, or the first $1 billion invested in its bitcoin ETF, with a fee of 0.25% after."

        "content": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Approved by SEC, Cleared To Start Trading Thursday Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are cleared to begin trading Thursday after receiving regulatory approval on Wednesday from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator gave the green light to the following products (and their proposed ticker symbols): Blackrock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n\nARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW)\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB)\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\n\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI) It has been a long road for the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States. The journey began in 2013 when an entity affiliated with the Winklevoss twins sent the first application for such a financial product to the SEC. However, it was Blackrock's (BLK) application for a spot bitcoin product in June last year that gathered momentum behind the idea. The SEC's sign-off serves as a significant regulatory seal of approval for the world's largest crypto asset, likely reducing some investor fears about investing in the space. It not only brings more regulatory safeguards but allows investors to invest with well-established financial firms. -Kyle Torpey\n\nEquity Indexes Wrap: Magnificent Seven Gain Amid Broad Rally The Dow Home Depot (HD) led the index, gaining 3.1% after analysts at Wedbush upgraded the stock to \u201coutperform,\u201d citing the reversal of several factors that hurt the home improvement retailer in 2023, including plummeting home sales and a shift in consumer spending from goods to services. Microsoft (MSFT) gained 1.9% to close just below its record high. Salesforce (CRM) rose 1.1% amid reports it was implementing a hiring freeze in its tech and product divisions. Boeing (BA) found its footing, rising 0.9% as its CEO vowed in an all-hands meeting that the company would approach reviews of its safety and manufacturing with \u201ccomplete transparency.\u201d Apple (AAPL) added 0.6%. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) led the laggards, falling 2.7%. Intel (INTC), one of several semiconductor stocks to struggle Wednesday, fell 1.2%.\n\nThe S&P 500 Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) added 3.5% after it raised its annual dividend by 33% and authorized an additional $5 billion in stock buybacks. Competitors PulteGroup (PHM) and D.R. Horton (DHI) rose 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. Howmet Aerospace (HWM) rose 3.5% after analysts at Trust Securities upgraded the stock to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201chold\u201d and raised their price target to $74 from $47. Juniper Networks (JNPR) added 2.1%, climbing for a second day after Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) confirmed it would buy the networking infrastructure company for about $14 billion. Hewlett Packard rose 1.7%, recovering some of yesterday\u2019s losses. Quest Diagnostics (DGX) led the index\u2019s losers, falling 3.6%. It was followed closely behind by Capital One Financial (COF) and Phillips 66 (PSX), down 3% and 2.8%, respectively. Etsy (ETSY) lost 2.7% after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock on consumer spending concerns. Est\u00e9e Lauder (EL) fell 2.6% after fund manager Terry Smith, dubbed \u201cBritain\u2019s Warren Buffett,\u201d sold his fund\u2019s stake in the cosmetics company.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) jumped 10.3% after reporting better-than-expected preliminary fourth-quarter results. Tech and cybersecurity stocks charged higher with Palo Alto Networks (PANW) adding 5.2%, while Atlassian (TEAM) and MongoDB (MDB) each climbed 3.8%.

Alphabet (GOOGL) rose 0.9%. Chip stocks GlobalFoundries (GFS) and Onsemi (ON) lagged, falling 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively. Gilead Sciences (GILD) also fell 1.8% after a California court ruled the company could face negligence claims over delays in the development of new HIV drugs.\n\nWD-40 Stock Jumps as Profit and Sales Exceed Estimates Shares of WD-40 Co. (WDFC) skyrocketed Wednesday as the maintenance and household products manufacturer posted better-than-expected results on strong demand for its namesake lubricant. WD-40 reported first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.28, with revenue increasing 12% to $140.4 million for the period ended Nov. 30, 2023. Both exceeded forecasts. Net sales rose 10% in the Americas to $64.08 million, as sales of WD-40 Multi-Use Product rose 12%. The company noted it benefited from promotional programs. Net sales jumped 20% to $48.75 million in the Europe, India, Middle East, Africa (EIMEA) region, and by 6% to $27.59 million in the Asia-Pacific market. WD-40 shares on Wednesday soared 14.5% in intraday trading, reaching their highest level since April 2021. -Bill McColl TradingView.\n\nMeta, Nvidia Stocks Surge to Close in on Major Milestones Shares of both Meta Platforms (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) jumped Wednesday, putting the Magnificent Seven stocks within striking distance of two distinct milestones. Meta was up about 4% Wednesday afternoon, putting it just 4% off both an all-time high and a $1 trillion market cap. Meta became only the fifth U.S. company to reach that milestone in June 2021. That was before the company\u2019s shares peaked at a record high of $384 in September of that year and plummeted to just $89 in November 2022. Nvidia, meanwhile, was up more than 2%, adding to yesterday\u2019s gains, which carried it to an all-time high. Since entering the $1 trillion club in May, the stock has continued to climb higher. With Wednesday\u2019s gains, Nvidia\u2019s market cap surpassed $1.3 trillion, putting it closer to catching America\u2019s fourth-most valuable company, Amazon (AMZN), which has a market cap of $1.59 trillion. The difference is considerable; it\u2019s about the size of Netflix ($211 billion), McDonald\u2019s ($211 billion), or Intel ($202 billion). But if any company can close that gap in the blink of an eye, it\u2019s Nvidia, which added $184 billion in one day last May.\n\nMidday Movers Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) shares jumped after the maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical device reported preliminary fourth quarter and full-year revenue that exceeded estimates. Shares of Lennar (LEN) advanced as the home builder raised its dividend by $0.50 to $2 per share and said it would buy back up to $5 billion in additional stock. Shares of rival home builders gained as well. Amazon (AMZN) shares gained as the tech giant announced it was cutting hundreds of jobs from its Prime Video, MGM Studios, and Twitch units. Est\u00e9e Lauder (EL) shares dropped as Terry Smith, a hedge fund manager known as \u201cBritain\u2019s Warren Buffett,\u201d dumped his stake. Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD) declined when a California court ruled it could face claims of negligence over a delay in releasing a safer treatment for HIV. American Express (AXP) shares slipped as BMO Capital Markets downgraded the stock, saying the banking sector faces headwinds. -Bill McColl\n\nIntuitive Surgical Stock Jumps After Company Reports Strong Preliminary Q4 Results Shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) moved sharply higher Wednesday as the maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical device said it anticipates better-than-expected results on a rise in surgical procedures. The company, in reporting preliminary fourth-quarter results, said revenue rose 17% to $1.93 billion, beating analysts forecasts. Full-year sales climbed 14% to $7.12 billion, also ahead of estimates. Intuitive Surgical said that worldwide da Vinci procedures jumped 21% in the latest quarter, mainly because eased COVID-19 restrictions in China led to an increase in operations there. The company is expected to report final results on January 23. Intuitive Surgical shares were up 6.5% at $351.98, their highest level since July, in midday trading. -Bill McColl\n\nAmazon Stock Ticks Up Following Streaming, Studio Layoffs Shares of Amazon (AMZN) rose more than 1% Wednesday morning after the company said in an email to employees it would lay off hundreds of employees in its streaming and studio businesses. Amazon also announced it would lay off 500 employees at its Twitch live-streaming unit. The cuts represent 35% of all Twitch staff. \u201cFor some time now the organization has been sized based upon where we optimistically expect our business to be in 3 or more years, not where we\u2019re at today. As with many other companies in the tech space, we are now sizing our organization based upon the current scale of our business and conservative predictions of how we expect to grow in the future,\u201d the company said in a Twitch blog post. Amazon is also not the only streaming company to pull back on content investment in the last year. Disney (DIS) cut its content budget by $3 billion last February, then cut it another $3 billion in August amid the writers and actors strikes. Netflix (NFLX) in May was reportedly aiming for $300 million in production cuts in 2023. At the same time, the price of streaming services rose dramatically in the last two years as companies came under pressure to turn a profit after years of bleeding money.\n\nBitcoin, Coinbase Fall Ahead of ETF Decision Bitcoin slid Wednesday morning to about $45,000 ahead of a long-awaited decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission on a spot Bitcoin ETF. Crypto advocates have been hoping for a spot Bitcoin ETF for years, and their hopes were thought to be realized for a brief moment yesterday afternoon when the SEC tweeted that it had approved the products. The post was quickly refuted by the regulator and removed from its page. \u201cThe @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products,\u201d tweeted SEC Chair Gary Gensler after the incident. Bitcoin jumped to nearly $48,000 immediately following the disputed tweet before tumbling to around $45,500. Despite the SEC\u2019s assertions that the tweet was false, markets and prospective ETF issuers are all but certain it represents more of a false start than anything else.\n\nSteven McClurg, chief investment officer of Valkyrie, which has an ETF application before regulators, told Bloomberg on Tuesday he is \"95% sure that we will be trading [a spot ETF] on Thursday.\" Wednesday is the deadline for regulators to decide whether to approve or deny ARK Invest and 21Shares\u2019 joint ETF application, and many expect the SEC will approve several applications simultaneously to avoid playing kingmaker. ETF applicants like BlackRock and VanEck, anticipating both approvals and fierce competition, filed a slew of updates with the SEC earlier this week outlining their fee structures, with many offering reduced fees\u2014or waiving them entirely\u2014upon launch. Shares of Coinbase (COIN) followed Bitcoin lower, dropping 4.5% in early trading on Wednesday. Still, the crypto exchange, which has been named the asset custodian for several proposed ETFs, has seen its stock soar more than 200% in the past year.\n\nStocks Making the Biggest Moves Premarket Gains: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG): Shares jumped about 5% after the company said it had placed 415 da Vinci robotic surgical systems in the fourth quarter and 1,370 in all of 2023, increases of 12% and 8%, respectively, over the prior year.\n\nToast Inc. (TOST): Shares of the restaurant payment systems provider rose more than 5% to about $20 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d and set a price target of $24.\n\nLennar Corp. (LEN): Shares of the homebuilder gained 2% after it raised its annual dividend by 33% to $2 per share and authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases.\n\nLosses: Aehr Test Systems (AEHR): Shares of the company, which makes test systems for semiconductors, plummeted 18% after it cut its fiscal-year revenue forecast amid a slowdown in the electric vehicle market.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN): Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange fell 3% after the SEC said a tweet claiming it had approved spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading was false. Other Bitcoin-exposed stocks, like miners Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), were also lower.\n\nEtsy Inc. (ETSY): Shares of the e-commerce platform slipped almost 2% after Goldman Sachs analysts downgraded the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy,\u201d saying Wall Street\u2019s estimates fairly reflected the company\u2019s near-term growth prospects."
