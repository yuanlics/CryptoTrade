        "title": "A tokenized version of Bitcoin is launching on Solana. Here\u2019s what you need to know - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency on the planet, and as such it has become central to the industry, which spans many blockchains.\n\nBut Bitcoin as a transactable asset has its limits. Although it hosts the most valuable coin, the Bitcoin blockchain is slow to adopt new features, and executing smaller transactions is slow and often costly.\n\nTo solve these drawbacks and allow investors on different blockchains to use and leverage Bitcoin, the Threshold Network, backed by Threshold DAO, created the first \u201ctokenized\u201d version of Bitcoin, tBTC, which launched Tuesday on the Solana blockchain.\n\nBut what is a tokenized version of a cryptocurrency, and what are the advantages of tBTC that give it the potential to level up DeFi on Solana? Matt Luongo and Maclane Wilkison, two key architects of the tBTC protocol, are here to explain.\n\nWhat is tokenized crypto?\n\nYou can put native Bitcoin in a hardware wallet or in a software wallet, or send it to someone, Luongo told Fortune, but it\u2019s limited in how it can be used by smart contracts, even with the Lightning Network, a layer-2 protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network to expedite smaller transactions.\n\nWhen someone mints tBTC on Solana, they send Bitcoin to be \u201cwrapped,\u201d which involves a process of decentralized review. The crypto is held in custody in a wallet that is validated by 51 of 100 people operating \u201cnodes\u201d on the Threshold Network that review and agree the crypto you\u2019ve sent is correct and authentic.\n\nYou can then mint the same number of Bitcoin that you wrapped, but in tBTC, which can be used on the Solana blockchain. The tBTC, therefore, serves as a receipt that allows you to prove you have a certain number of Bitcoin. If you want your Bitcoin back, simply trade for it with tBTC. After 51 of 100 validators sign off, you can claim your original Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a single party going bankrupt and you can\u2019t get your money, or a single party walking off\u201451 people have to have tried to actively be malicious to prevent you from getting your money back when you want it,\u201d Luongo explained.\n\nWhy is this useful?\n\nThe original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, remains the hardest to use, added Luongo, also CEO of Thesis, the venture studio behind the Threshold Network.\n\n\u201cBitcoin by itself is not that useful\u2014Lightning has been limited,\u201d Luongo said. \u201cTools like Solana, and like some of these other layer-2s in the ecosystem, are alternatives to Lightning. They\u2019re alternatives to scaling Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIf you want to take out a loan against your Bitcoin, you often have to turn to centralized lenders, like BlockFi, which filed for bankruptcy in November. This puts your crypto at risk. With tBTC, investors can take out loans against Bitcoin on the Solana blockchain while avoiding the limitations of the Bitcoin Network and the risk of using a centralized loan platform.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s cool about tBTC is, we\u2019re saying okay, if you have Bitcoin, you can go to Solana and you can get USD loans,\u201d Luongo said. \u201cYou can start earning yield on your Bitcoin, and that\u2019s something that a lot of holders just have not had access to at all.\u201d\n\nWilkison, CEO of the crypto infrastructure company Nucypher, added that other uses range from loaning out Bitcoin to others to trading it on decentralized exchanges to using it as a liquidity token.\n\nDo other tokenized versions of BTC exist?\n\nThere are ways to tokenize Bitcoin that are more centralized. For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin, or wBTC, allows users to create a tokenized version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum network. Luongo pointed out that he believes wBTC is less safe than tBTC because it involves crypto being held by a single custodian instead of in a wallet controlled by a series of validators like with tBTC.\n\nApart from Solana, Threshold has launched tBTC on other blockchains\u2014Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. The current supply of tBTC is about $29 million across all blockchains, according to Dune, compared with $4.2 billion of wBTC.\n\nSolana has been rebuilding its credibility after taking a hit last year because of associations with Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX and Alameda Research, which declared bankruptcy in November. But Luongo said he believes on-chain DeFi is making a comeback.\n\n\u201cI think tBTC is going to be the beginning of a renaissance for DeFi on Solana,\u201d he added.\n\nAlameda had been a big source of Bitcoin liquidity for the Solana blockchain, but tBTC may be able to help fill that gap, according to Wilkison, who added: \u201cOne important piece is bringing back Bitcoin to Solana, but another is bringing it back in a way that\u2019s not exposed to those types of centralized risks.\u201d"

        "title": "BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin Bets Are Bad For The Planet - greenpeace.org",
        "content": "BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin Bets Are Bad For The Planet\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is placing a big bet on Bitcoin that could drive up the digital asset\u2019s price and its climate-damaging pollution. Despite pledges to reduce carbon emissions and acknowledgement that climate risks are investment risks, BlackRock is investing in dirty Bitcoin without acknowledging its energy intensity or carbon emissions. This is bad news for the planet.\n\nIn June 2023, BlackRock applied for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to the price of Bitcoin. This first-of-its-kind product made headlines and was followed by a spike in the price of bitcoin.\n\nAn ETF is basically a way for investors to bet on Bitcoin\u2019s value without having to actually buy and hold bitcoin, which can be tricky as well as risky. A Bitcoin ETF managed by a large company like BlackRock could attract many more mainstream investors. But the potential profits for BlackRock and investors would come at a sharp cost to the climate and the rest of society. When Bitcoin\u2019s price and trading volume goes up, so does its energy consumption and carbon emissions. With Bitcoin\u2019s annual carbon emissions already at the scale of a mid-sized industrial country, the world simply can\u2019t afford to support Bitcoin\u2019s price growth.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s ETF proposal builds on other products and services the company offers that enable investing in Bitcoin. In 2022, the company launched a private bitcoin trust that would let institutional investors bet on the price of Bitcoin. This was part of a larger effort to make it more convenient for investors to manage Bitcoin alongside their standard portfolios of stocks and bonds. BlackRock partnered with Coinbase, the crypto exchange company, to integrate Bitcoin into the Coinbases popular investment management platform called Aladdin which would let clients track their bitcoin holdings and trade bitcoin via Coinbase\u2019s exchange.\n\nBlackRock is also putting some of its massive assets into Bitcoin mining companies \u2013 the facilities that create Bitcoin\u2019s large carbon footprint. Greenpeace USA research finds that BlackRock controls nearly $600 million worth of shares in Bitcoin mining companies and has shares in most of the large publicly traded miners. These investments are vital for mining companies to access funding for their energy-intensive facilities. For example, BlackRock controlled over 28 million shares valued at $300 million in Riot Platforms, which owns the most energy-intensive U.S. crypto mine in Rockdale, Texas that uses as much electricity as the nearest 300,000 homes. And nearly all that energy is supplied by fossil fuels.\n\nBlackRock also has ties to Bitcoin miners keeping dirty coal power plants alive. The company owns $2.8 million worth of bonds in Marathon Digital whose mining facility helped keep the coal-fired Hardin Generating Station in Hardin, MT operating past its planned closure in 2018. In 2021, this led to 755,700 tons of CO2 emissions and local air pollution with 304 tons of sulfur dioxide and 245 tons of nitrogen oxides. BlackRock also controls a nearly 6% share in Greenidge Generation Holdings, a company that converted a closed coal plant to fossil gas in upstate New York to power a Bitcoin mine. Regulators and the public have scrutinized the facility for its pollution.\n\nAnd when mining companies struggle financially, BlackRock has helped them stay afloat. When Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy in 2022, BlackRock joined a group of creditors that lent the company around $500 million, chipping in $38 million, and contributing another $17 million loan to help Core Scientific operate during bankruptcy.\n\nYet, BlackRock could turn its resources, expertise, and clout towards transforming Bitcoin and mobilizing stakeholders to work on innovative solutions that slash Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint while maintaining its key features. Cryptocurrencies don\u2019t have to use massive amounts of electricity. Most don\u2019t, and they can change. Now is the time for BlackRock to acknowledge Bitcoin\u2019s pollution and help solve the problem."

It\u2019s not a passing fad.\n\nFor all of the legal trouble that entrepreneurs like Sam Bankman-Fried are in and the regulatory mess that companies like Binance find themselves in, people keep buying cryptocurrency.\n\nEven as the price of Bitcoin fell precipitously in 2022, the percentage of people in the United States owning crypto grew to 11 percent from 3 percent in just a year. It\u2019s at 12 percent this year, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, and Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen more than 75 percent from its 2022 low.\n\nCrypto conviction \u2014 or just curiosity \u2014 is not something that merits condescension from the olds and scolds of personal finance. It just requires you to ask a few questions about who you are and why you find crypto alluring.\n\nIt is true that younger adults are more open to this way of putting money to work. If you\u2019re under 40, you\u2019re more likely to own crypto than people over 60, according to the N.B.E.R. research. You\u2019re also more likely to be male."

        "title": "Michael Saylor's Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bet Has Rebounded - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nMichael Saylor, MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and executive chairman, has seen his bold bet on bitcoin vindicated as BTC\u2019s price has risen dramatically since his resignation as CEO.\n\nA longtime Bitcoin advocate, Saylor began publicly purchasing large amounts of bitcoin in 2020, devoting MicroStrategy\u2019s resources to several high-profile acquisitions that built up a reserve of nearly $2 billion worth by 2022. Although he began these purchases with the bitcoin price at around $10,000, the price had reached more than $30,000 by August 2022, roughly where the price sits at the time of this writing. Many of the firm\u2019s largest purchases were at the higher end of this premium, and Saylor resigned from his position as CEO that same month as MicroStrategy reported a $1 billion loss related to a bitcoin price slump.\n\nAfter Saylor\u2019s resignation, poor performance from bitcoin turned worse as the cryptocurrency exchange FTX cratered in spectacular fashion in November 2022. Through the rest of the year, the bitcoin price remained at around half of what it was when Saylor and MicroStrategy made many of its purchases. However, rising from these lows, the cryptocurrency rose dramatically and consistently throughout 2023 until seeming to generally recover from this valley.\n\nOne year on from his departure from leading MicroStrategy, it seems that Saylor\u2019s persistence is bearing fruit. Although he resigned from his position as CEO, responsible for day-to-day management and operations of his company, he did retain a role as executive chairman of its board, leading the company\u2019s shareholders and representing the firm publicly. With a focus on continuing the firm\u2019s bitcoin strategy, Saylor continued buying thousands of bitcoin at reduced prices, and his commitment seems to be paying off.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Saylor noted MicroStrategy\u2019s 254% increase in stock price since the beginning of his strategy, comparing it to the stock prices of firms like Google and Apple, which rose 78% and 74%, respectively. The decision to publicly tie MicroStrategy\u2019s fortune to bitcoin has, at least for now, led to gains unrelated to the firm\u2019s core products and offerings. This month, the company revealed a plan to sell $750 million of its stock, ostensibly to make further large purchases of bitcoin, and its value rose when the news broke.\n\nSaylor\u2019s work with Bitcoin has gone beyond this high-profile advocacy, as he has taken to development work on the Lightning Network in the past year as well. More than anything, these displays of conviction have shown that his commitment to Bitcoin\u2019s economic vision are genuine, rather than based merely on the dollar price at any given time.\n\nThis decision to wholeheartedly back Bitcoin has seemingly turned into a durable business strategy, capable of weathering and surmounting significant tempests in the global economy.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Listen to this article Listen to this article\n\nOnce the pariah of the financial world, Bitcoin\u2019s staying power has won over Wall Street. Asset managers now are racing to bring the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency to millions of Americans.\n\nBlackRock is leading the charge in a new spate of filings to launch a Bitcoin (BTC) spot price ETF. Invesco, VanEck and WisdomTree are in hot pursuit of their proposed funds.\n\nYet the Securities and Exchange Commission has been on a regulatory tirade against crypto this year, launching investigations into Coinbase and Binance and threatening to freeze their access to the U.S. banking system.\n\nWhere is Wall Street and the US government\u2019s clash over crypto headed?\n\nSpot ETFs aren\u2019t the only thing that is happening. Newcomer crypto exchange EDX Markets, funded by finance titans like Charles Schwab and Fidelity Digital Assets, opened trading for BTC and ether (ETH) last month.\n\nThe institutional adoption of crypto is wider than the US too. Across the pond in Europe, Deutsche Bank also revealed it had applied for a digital asset custody license in Germany.\n\nThe news has triggered a price pump for Bitcoin that recently went north of $31,000, reaching new 14-month highs. Yet the regulatory chess game is far from over. The industry is sitting tight as it awaits the SEC\u2019s next move.\n\nGoing mainstream?\n\nWhile Wall Street is keen to bring BTC into the financial big league, regulators in Washington still need to be ready to give it an entry pass. On June 30, the SEC claimed BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s filings were insufficient and lacked clarity. However, that has yet to deter BlackRock, and the world\u2019s largest asset manager served up a refreshed filing just days later.\n\nThe direction of travel seems toward greater adoption, and some financial advisors see the asset\u2019s time has come.\n\n\u201cWall Street will prevail, just a matter of when, not if,\u201d says Bryan Courchesne, CEO of Digital Asset Investment Management (DAIM). \u201cBlackRock and Fidelity aren\u2019t going to waste their time with repeated filings. They must feel like there is a high likelihood of succeeding in the near future. Maybe they have to amend small details and refile, but we think that within eight months, there will be at least one spot BTC ETF available to investors.\u201d\n\nIf it does hit the market, the question for investors interested in crypto then becomes whether to buy up this unique ETF vs. mutual funds that offer exposure to blockchain technologies. And if so, whether to trade on short-term fluctuations in price or go long and hold on for good (or to \u201chold\u201d as it is known in the crypto community).\n\nDespite its relatively short history, investors who have invested in actual Bitcoin typically have a long-term horizon. On-chain analysis from February this year shows the average time that Bitcoin (BTC) stays in an address before being transferred is 3.8 years (or around 45 months), a testament to the confidence in the asset\u2019s long-term prospects. Age is another factor; crypto investing is also particularly prevalent among younger investors.\n\nA 2022 survey from Investopedia shows millennials are the most bullish on crypto, with 38% owning some form of cryptocurrency investment. They were followed by Gen X and Gen Z investors, with 28% and 23% holding crypto assets, respectively.\n\nNot all crypto assets are made equal, and investors should be aware of the fundamentals behind the quirky names and shiny logos of new de-fi projects. Courchesne warns crypto investors to avoid altcoins \u2013 a term for non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies.\n\nThey are controlled by entities that need naive investors to provide liquidity so that they can dump their coins and make money,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf you are going to invest in crypto, we highly recommend sticking to BTC and ETH for now,\u201d Courchesne says. \u201cWe would weight a portfolio more to Bitcoin since it is still relatively safer than ETH.\u201d\n\nOthers extend a cautious word of warning for any form of blockchain-based coin.\n\n\u201cWe advise against clients holding any portion of their portfolio in cryptocurrency,\u201d Caleb Vering, associate wealth adviser at Farnam Financial. \u201cWe consider any crypto to be an extremely volatile and highly speculative asset unsuitable for most investors.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is broadly used as a hedging asset and, similarly to gold, as a digital store of value. Some experts see BTC may have already achieved that state.\n\n\u201cTo some extent, Bitcoin is already in the past,\u201d says Chris Chen, CFP and wealth strategist at Insight Financial Strategists. \u201cIt has already achieved a status analogous to gold as a safe haven.\u201d\n\nYet can it serve as an international reserve currency like the gold standard did before the end of the Bretton Woods system? BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink may consider it a new \u201cinternational asset,\u201d yet Bitcoin is unique among cryptocurrencies for its resilience and longevity, its relationship to nationalized fiat currencies is more dubious.\n\nA major disrupter could be the arrival of state-backed stablecoins that function on blockchain technology but remain run by government authorities. Depending on adoption, stablecoins could undermine Bitcoin\u2019s utility and puncture a hole in its market value.\n\nChen says the US government is unlikely to cede the power it gains from the greenback to a decentralized currency that is out of its hands. \u201cIt is much more plausible that our government will introduce its own blockchain-based currency that it will control,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe Chinese yuan is already partially on blockchain \u2026 many other major currencies are exploring blockchain applications. While the future of currency is likely to be associated with blockchain implementations, they are going to be controlled by governments as they are today.\u201d\n\nThe arrival of a BTC-based ETF simplifies crypto investing and enables retail investors to easily add exposure to Bitcoin in retirement plans and brokerage accounts as they would gold or oil futures, potentially rocketing adoption levels to new heights. Yet the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term value will be determined by whether it can fulfill its promise as a form of digital gold in the global financial system.\n\nUltimately, the value of crypto will be determined by regulations and the success of the government\u2019s efforts to produce a state-centric clone that would once again kick Bitcoin to the sidelines of the global financial system. In any case, the \u201cdigital gold\u201d saga has a long way to go yet."

Source: Euronext Amsterdam\n\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, the offering was touted as the first spot or physical-backed Bitcoin (BTC) fund that would allow investors to gain exposure to a financial product that is physically backed by BTC.\n\nThe new exchange-traded fund (ETF) is set to trade under the BCOIN ticker, while the product was approved by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission back in October 2021. As reported by Blockworks, Fidelity Digital Assets will handle the custodial elements of the BCOIN ETF.\n\nRelated: Grayscale Bitcoin ETF decision could happen this week, pundits say\n\nThe asset management firm also highlighted the environment and socially friendly nature of the fund, having added a renewable energy certificate (REC) to the ETF.\n\nThe fund taps into external data to measure the energy usage of the Bitcoin network and buys and retires the RECs. The RECs are also accounted for on a blockchain service, which is aimed to allow investors to verify the eco-friendly claims of the fund.\n\nBCOIN makes use of the FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index to access real-time average Bitcoin price data from certain cryptocurrency exchanges. The spot ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the Bitcoin market without having direct ownership or custody of the underlying asset.\n\nThe launch of the spot Bitcoin ETF marks a milestone for Europe, while United States regulators are yet to approve a number of similar spot Bitcoin ETF applications from major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nA statement from Jacobi CEO Martin Bednall highlighted the continent\u2019s progressive attitude toward cryptocurrency investment products as a potential catalyst for further adoption:\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to see Europe moving ahead of the US in opening up Bitcoin investing for institutional investors who want safe, secure access to the benefits of digital assets using familiar and regulated structures like our ETF.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF follows the debut of a Bitcoin Equities ETF on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange by Melanion Capital in June 2023. The ETF is designed to track the Melanion Bitcoin Exposure Index, which is a custom basket of European and American stocks closely tied to BTC\u2019s market price.\n\nThis differs from the spot ETF in that investors gain exposure to the fund, which comprises stocks from companies with significant investments in Bitcoin holdings, cryptocurrency exchanges and mining operations.\n\nThis includes the likes of technology firm MicroStrategy, which holds over 140,000 BTC, as well as major Bitcoin mining companies, such as Riot, Marathon Digital and Hut8.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: SBF ordered to jail, Bitcoin ETF delayed and SEC to appeal Ripple case: Hodler\u2019s Digest, Aug. 6\u201312"

        "content": "From The Markets Jacobi AM Lists Europe\u2019s First Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nFirst decarbonised digital asset fund compliant with SFDR Article 8\n\nLeading index provider, Wilshire Indexes, partners with Jacobi to provide the benchmark for BCOIN and future products\n\nVerifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution supplied by Zumo; differs from carbon offsetting by transparently and quantifiably addressing electricity consumption of BTC investing\n\nJacobi Asset Management (Jacobi) has listed Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF on Euronext Amsterdam. The Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF (the \u201cETF\u201d) represents the first decarbonised digital asset fund compliant with SFDR Article 8. Jacobi has implemented a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution which allows institutional investors to access the benefits of Bitcoin whilst also meeting ESG goals.\n\nThe ETF, regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC), trades under the ticker BCOIN. Custodial services are provided by Fidelity Digital AssetsSM, with Flow Traders operating as market makers and Jane Street and DRW as Authorised Participants. Fund benchmark, the FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index, is provided by Wilshire Indexes with the REC solution created in collaboration with digital asset platform, Zumo.\n\nCEO of Jacobi Asset Management, Martin Bednall said: \u201cIt is exciting to see Europe moving ahead of the US in opening up Bitcoin investing for institutional investors who want safe, secure access to the benefits of digital assets using familiar and regulated structures like our ETF. Unlike other products in the European market which are debt instruments, our fund owns the underlying asset directly. Jacobi is proud to be supported by Tier1 partners at the forefront of this digital asset market evolution whilst also pioneering an innovative, environmentally sound solution for European investors.\u201d\n\nMark Makepeace, CEO of Wilshire Indexes, added: \u201cThe launch of the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is an important milestone for the digital asset industry and a transformative moment for the global financial industry. We are excited about the partnership with Jacobi and, as a leader in the development of institutional grade digital asset benchmarks, we are committed to helping accelerate the advancement of the entire digital asset ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF offers an ESG-aligned digital asset solution where environmentally conscious ETF buyers can consider Bitcoin within their investment portfolio, as well as independently audit the environmental claims. Jacobi\u2019s solution differs from carbon offsetting products by quantifying the electricity consumption attributable to Bitcoin in the ETF and purchasing equivalent RECs, the standardised instrument for procuring clean power. This provides digital proof of RECs, transparently recorded on a blockchain.\n\nKirsteen Harrison, Environmental Manager, Zumo, commented: \u201cThe decarbonisation of crypto is one of the most pressing challenges facing the nascent digital assets sector, and there is increasing pressure on all businesses to have credible plans to decarbonise. We\u2019ve been working closely with Jacobi Asset Management to help them build out an ESG-aligned, future-proofed crypto offering for their customers. It\u2019s hugely exciting to see it come to life in the shape of Europe\u2019s first Bitcoin ETF. We\u2019re creating the investment products of tomorrow \u2013 what a moment for the industry.\u201d\n\nEmanuel van Praag, lawyer at Kennedy Van der Laan, commented: \u201cWe are proud to have provided legal counsel to Jacobi AM in its listing of the first SFDR Article 8 digital assets fund.\u201d\n\nSource: Jacobi"

        "title": "Bitcoin trading sideways; NFT transactions soar; Nvidia leads Wall Street rally - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin edged higher on Tuesday morning in Asia but failed to breach the US$29,500 resistance level. Ether also edged up, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to higher. Solana\u2019s SOL led the winners. As risk sentiment improved in the wake of weak U.S. inflation data, last week saw an inflow for digital asset investment products after three consecutive weeks of outflows. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index moved up after the NFT market logged the largest weekly total transactions since February 2022. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed higher Monday on the back of a rally led by chipmaker Nvidia.\n\nA blessing in disguise\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.35% in the last 24 hours to US$29,408.45 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, and logged a weekly gain of 0.91%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$29,660.25 early Tuesday morning.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has remained largely within the $29,000 to $30,600 range for the past seven weeks, causing frustration among investors seeking higher rewards. However, low volatility could be a blessing in disguise, Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThis newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,\u201d Green said.\n\n\u201cThis stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,\u201d he added.\n\nMatteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note that low volatility does not necessarily mean low investor interest in the coin.\n\nGreco pointed to the Bitcoin long-term holder level \u2014 a metric that measures the percentage of Bitcoin holders who have held the coin for over 155 days \u2014which reached its highest ever level over the first week of August.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe data shows how the vast majority of BTC holders did not execute trades in the last few months, as the low volumes and the almost inexistent volatility recorded in the last two months suggest,\u201d said Greco.\n\n\u201cThese numbers are also typical to be observed during the summer months, especially July and August, and do not reflect a decrease in investors\u2019 interest towards the digital asset market,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, digital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending August 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million \u2014 roughly 93% of the total inflows.\n\nThe inflows to digital asset investment products are \u201clikely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,\u201d CoinShares wrote in the report.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether gained 0.22% to US$1,844.14 and added 1.05% for the past seven days. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded higher with the exception of Dogecoin, which inched 0.06% lower to US$0.07477 but gained 2.05% for the week.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL led the winners, rising 3.50% to US$25.17 for a 9.42% weekly gain.\n\nSynesis One, an artificial intelligence (AI) data crowdsourcing platform based on the Solana blockchain, launched its new train-to-earn application \u201cWorkspace by Synesis\u201d on Monday.\n\nThe app allows users to train AIs as data providers while earning cryptocurrencies as rewards. This process, Synesis One claims, will result in a \u201cfully traceable and auditable\u201d data supply chain.\n\nWe are proud to announce the launch of the Synesis One AI data crowdsourcing app on @solana Mainnet! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89https://t.co/L4Bjq5upgT\n\n\n\nMore information in the \ud83e\uddf5below! pic.twitter.com/eyd4wtBHYD \u2014 Synesis One (@synesis_one) August 14, 2023\n\nOutside the top 10 cryptos, HBAR, the utility token of distributed ledger technology platform Hedera Hashgraph, saw its price surge 13.59% in the past 24 hours to US$0.06666. That contributed to a weekly jump of 12.89%.\n\nHBAR received a boost after Dropp, a Hedera-based micropayments application, was added to the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s instant payments platform FedNow. The Fed-run service allows merchants to \u201caccept small-value purchases digitally without paying large transaction fees\u201d following its launch in July.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization moved up 0.40% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume rose 47.95% to US$28.52 billion.\n\nWeekly NFT transactions hit year-long high\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index moved up 0.39% in the past 24 hours to 2,486.89 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, and notched a 0.27% gain for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Polygon NFT indexes also logged gains, while the indexes for Solana and Cardano dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 22.88% in the past 24 hours to over US$16.48 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all logged gains, while volume on the Bitcoin blockchain dipped.\n\nIn the week ending August 13, NFT sales topped US$101 million after sitting short of US$100 million for three consecutive weeks. Meanwhile, NFT transactions for the week totaled more than 2.80 million, a high not seen since February 2022.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, commenting on the past week\u2019s surge in NFT sales, said that he saw the emergence of low-priced collections as key to a sustained potential uptick in the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a glimpse of the future of NFTs. More affordable prices, higher volume, likely big brands and this is what we\u2019re seeing in DraftKings, DMarket, Gods Unchained, and Sorare,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nCombined, Petscher noted, those three collections alone notched 872,185 transactions \u2014 nearly a third of the week\u2019s total transactions.\n\n\u201cThe question is, is this sustainable? I think it is, and that\u2019s exactly why this will be the future. Traders haven\u2019t really left NFT, they just ran out of liquidity since there\u2019s no profits. But they can afford NFTs that are priced at just a few dollars,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based DeGods saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. The collection surged 144.25% to over US$2.21 million after the project launched its \u201cSeason 3\u201d digital art collection on Sunday.\n\nRather than introducing new NFTs, Season 3 allows its holders to upgrade their original DeGods NFT and receive four generative artworks.\n\nMythos Chain-based DMarket and ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained \u2014 two video game-adjacent collections \u2014 came in second and third place in terms of 24-hour sales volume.\n\nMeanwhile, global beverage giant Coca-Cola Company introduced its \u201cMasterpiece\u201d NFT collection on Monday. The collection combines classic and contemporary art pieces with virtual coca-cola bottles, the company said.\n\nCheck out the link below to see the full Masterpiece collection https://t.co/PQoKJCmUWe \u2014 Coca-Cola (@CocaCola) August 13, 2023\n\nThe collection is issued on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum layer-2 network recently launched by crypto exchange Coinbase.\n\nNvidia leads US equities rally\n\nNvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong following gains at the close of trading Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the gains with a rise of 0.34%.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes traded mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved higher.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia Corporation posted a rise of 7.09% on Monday, its highest daily rise since May. That jump followed a note from multinational investment bank Morgan Stanley that described the U.S. tech giant as its \u201ctop pick\u201d amid a \u201cmassive shift in spending towards AI.\u201d\n\nNvidia\u2019s highly anticipated quarterly earnings report is due for release next week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first day in a while that tech has really significantly outperformed,\u201d Jay Hatfield, CEO of U.S.-based investment advisor Infrastructure Capital Advisors, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s indicative of the fact that you have this blockbuster Nvidia report coming up and that could support the tech market pretty substantially,\u201d Hatfield added.\n\nU.S. investors now await the release of retail sales data on Tuesday, followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting minutes on Wednesday, for further insight on the health of the U.S. economy and the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level since January 2001. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 88.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s central bank unexpectedly lowered the rate of its medium-term lending facility (MLF) by 15 basis points to 2.5% on Tuesday, only two months after the previous rate cut in June.\n\n\u201cThe slightly earlier timing and a larger than expected 15 basis point rate cut of MLF show that Beijing feels the urgency to take more policy easing actions to stabilize expectations and growth,\u201d Xiaojia Zhi, chief China economist at international banking group Credit Agricole, told Bloomberg.\n\nZhi added that China could see more monetary easing in the coming months.\n\nThe decision was announced shortly before China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics reported disappointing economic data for July. That data included a rise in the urban unemployment rate, as well as decelerated and smaller-than-expected growth in retail sales and industrial production, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "title": "Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Over the 15 years since Bitcoin was created, there has been no shortage of crazy conspiracy theories about how it was made and where it came from.\n\nSome believe Bitcoin was the work of \u201ca bunch of engineers\u201d in the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 presumably for world domination; others claim Bitcoin is the work of benevolent aliens to help humans evolve.\n\n\n\nBut one theory with circumstantial evidence supporting it has persisted over the years \u2014 and it involves one of America\u2019s most secretive intelligence-gathering agencies.\n\nThere\u2019s a small sect of Bitcoiners that believes Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 the creator of Bitcoin \u2014 is, in fact, the United States National Security Agency in disguise.\n\n\n\nMany more, of course, think the idea is ridiculous and point out there\u2019s no absolutely no solid evidence to support it.\n\nBut where does the theory stem from? Well, one only needs to look into Bitcoin\u2019s source code.\n\nIt\u2019s in the code\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin so secure lies in its use of Secure Hash Algorithm 256, or SHA-256 (read as sha), which is used for everything from deriving transaction IDs and block hashes to addresses and Merkle trees.\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s a mathematical formula that garbles data into a string of seemingly random text, and it\u2019s why Bitcoin is basically impossible to crack.\n\nWell, it just so happens that this algorithm is the direct work of Glenn M. Lilly, a mathematician who, under the direction of the NSA, designed and eventually published the algorithm in 2001. Lilly later became the NSA\u2019s chief of mathematics research.\n\nThe NSA was also one of the first organizations to describe a Bitcoin-like system in a 1996 paper titled How To Make A Mint: The Cryptography Of Anonymous Electronic Cash.\n\nIn the paper, the authors proposed a system that uses public-key cryptography to allow users to make anonymous payments without revealing their identity.\n\nThe NSA\u2019s 1996 plan to create anonymous electronic cash. (archive.org)\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is code for the CIA?\n\nOf course, some Bitcoiners don\u2019t think the NSA invented Bitcoin\u2026. they reckon it was the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe name of Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, can be interpreted as a reference to the U.S. spy agency. Nakamoto, loosely translated from Japanese, means \u201ccentral,\u201d while the name Satoshi means \u201cintelligent.\u201d\n\n\u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d means \u201ccentral intelligence\u201d in Japanese. Really. Look it up. (Ancestry.com)\n\nSpeaking of Satoshi, their identity has never been uncovered, prompting some to believe they are likely to have had some form of intelligence training.\n\nIn an interview with Impact Theory\u2019s Tom Bilyeu in June, former Goldman Sachs executive and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal revealed he\u2019s believed for years that Bitcoin could be the result of the NSA and the United Kingdom\u2019s government experimenting with potential ways to get out of future potential financial disasters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence it came out in the financial crisis. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that the halving cycle and all of this is all related.\u201d\n\nFinally they're saying it\u2026but it's not Bitcoin and never was.(Remember guys like him are the same ones that have been shouting Bitcoin and Ethereum for years. Why is he just now admitting he's known this all along?) pic.twitter.com/4nFlUN45N6 \u2014 Digital Asset Investor.XRP (@digitalassetbuy) June 9, 2023\n\nSo, did the NSA create Bitcoin?\n\nJeff Man, a former NSA cryptanalyst, tells Magazine that it\u2019s \u201cfeasible\u201d that the NSA could have created Bitcoin as a means to gather intelligence about its enemies, but is doubtful.\n\nMan joined the NSA in 1986 at the tail end of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the time, the NSA was hiring around 100 people a week to fill roles in critical skills, including engineering, mathematics and computer science, he says.\n\nOne of the NSA\u2019s main missions is to gather signals (or communications) intelligence necessary for the country\u2019s defense. This became an even higher priority following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the World Trade Center.\n\nPlumes of smoke billow from the World Trade Center towers. (Michael Foran, CC BY 2.0, Wikicommons)\n\nAsked about whether Bitcoin could have been created to gather intelligence about foreign agents and powers, Man said the agency certainly had the resources to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a possibility. It\u2019s certainly feasible,\u201d says Man.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not outside of the realm of possibility that there would be a concerted effort to set up something like this.\u201d\n\nHowever, Man has strong doubts about it, based on his experience at the agency. He notes that one of the outcomes of the Watergate scandal in 1972 put a congressional spotlight on America\u2019s three-letter agencies, which were found spying on American citizens without proper warrants.\n\n#Spystuff! The NSA's headquarters, known as the \"Crypto City,\" spans an impressive 2.6 million square feet! It houses cutting-edge technology, top-notch analysts, and a vast intelligence library. Talk about a fortress of knowledge and innovation. pic.twitter.com/Sg2isODJXy \u2014 Robert Morton (@Robert4787) June 6, 2023\n\nMan believes, at least based on his years at the NSA, that the agency had since been very cautious not to breach its charter and that devising Bitcoin could be seen as spying on its own citizens.\n\n\u201cHistorically, in my experience, NSA takes very seriously its charter to only do what NSA does to foreigners, and not U.S. citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it would be hard to prove or disprove perhaps who the targets were, or who were the potential targets. It would be hard to say definitively: \u2018We did not do any of this capability \u2014 we did not set it up and target any U.S. citizens.\u2019 That makes me doubt that it happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nMan, however, noted that he left the agency back in 1996 and conceded that the 2001 terror attacks and the subsequent Patriot Act may have changed this.\n\nThe Edward Snowden leaks in 2013 alleged the NSA had been gathering data on domestic internet communications without the proper warrants, an idea the U.S. government has denied.\n\nNo, the whole idea is silly\n\nOf course, most Bitcoiners completely dismiss the idea the NSA invented Bitcoin.\n\nWhile SHA-256 is used in Bitcoin, it also just happens to be one of the most widely used hash algorithms, making its presence in anything from digital signatures to password authentication.\n\nThe fact it was made public in 2001 means that everyone had access to it long before Bitcoin was invented. And no one has ever identified a secret backdoor into the SHA-256 algorithm or suggested a credible way it could be cracked.\n\nThey also patented SHA256 under a royalty-free license. \u2014 Alex Waltz (@raw_avocado) June 30, 2021\n\nSilicon Angle\u2019s Mellisa Tolentino addressed the notion that \u2018Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019 could be a veiled reference to \u201cCentral Intelligence\u201d, writing that the argument is \u201cnot very compelling.\u201d Satoshi Nakamoto is a fairly common Japanese name, and spy agencies don\u2019t tend to leave easter eggs calling attention to the fact they\u2019re involved.\n\n\n\n\u201cWould the NSA really have given the creator of its \u2018secret project\u2019 such an obvious name? If the NSA really is behind Bitcoin, naming it \u201cCentral Intelligence\u201d would not be a very intelligent move.\u201d\n\nOthers have argued that Bitcoin\u2019s first proof-of-concept software was more of a \u201cclever patchwork\u201d of old cryptography algorithms, which wouldn\u2019t be something an organized intelligence behemoth would come up with.\n\nAnd the idea that Nakamoto must have intelligence-training credentials, given that he has remained anonymous all these years also falls apart the closer you look at it.\n\n\u201cIt ignores the fact that thousands (if not millions) of people manage to remain anonymous online everyday,\u201d Ian DeMartino wrote in a Cointelegraph editorial.\n\n\u201cI have had internet friends that I talked to for years, on message boards and elsewhere, without ever meeting or talking on the phone. I suspect many reading this have had similar experiences. I don\u2019t suspect all of them are CIA agents.\u201d\n\nWill we ever find out if the NSA invented Bitcoin?\n\nIt seems unlikely we\u2019ll ever know for certain whether the NSA was involved in Bitcoin, at least not in our lifetime, says Man.\n\n\u201cYou will never get the answer to that definitively until it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s this honeypot type of scenario, where it\u2019s a resource for information [\u2026] and it\u2019s still providing results and information, you\u2019re never going to get the definitive answer,\u201d he adds.\n\nEvery time someone non-ironically calls me a \"Spook,\" I remind them that #Bitcoin runs on NSA encryption and that \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" means \"central intelligence.\" The response is usually thishttps://t.co/0HPSh4v2KY pic.twitter.com/Kr2sHbm2gh \u2014 Jason Lowery (@JasonPLowery) April 30, 2023"

        "content": "A recent report by the research firm Delphi Digital illustrates the predictable consistency of price action and trends within the crypto market. The report delves into the interconnectedness between the four-year Bitcoin (BTC) cycle and broader economic trends.\n\nAccording to Delphi Digital analysts, the ongoing consolidation at $30,000 is similar to the period between 2015 and 2017, with indicators pointing toward an all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nEconomic cycle's impact on Bitcoin's performance\n\nDelphi\u2019s analysis draws attention to the inherent cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market. This cyclicality is demonstrated by the timing between peak-to-trough bottoms, recovery periods to previous cycle highs and the timing of price rallies to new cycle tops. Using Bitcoin as a benchmark, Delphi outlines the general blueprint of a cryptocurrency market cycle.\n\nBitcoin price in USD (log scale) reflecting four-year cycles. Source: Delphi Digital\n\nThese four-year cycles include Bitcoin hitting a new ATH, experiencing an approximate 80% drawdown, then a bottom around one year later. This tends to be followed by a two-year recovery to prior highs and, finally, a price rally for another year leading to a new all-time high.\n\nThe research reveals a fascinating correlation between Bitcoin price peaks and changes in the business cycle, as indicated by the ISM Manufacturing Index.\n\nBitcoin/USD year-over-year (orange) vs. U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index year-over-year (white). Source: Delphi Digital\n\nDuring Bitcoin\u2019s price peaks, the ISM often demonstrates signs of topping out, and active addresses, transaction volumes and fees reach their highest point. Conversely, as the business cycle signals recovery, so do network activity levels.\n\nThe report emphasizes the Bitcoin halving\u2019s role in these cycles. The last two halvings occurred about 18 months after BTC bottomed and roughly seven months before a new ATH. This historical pattern indicates a projected new ATH for Bitcoin by the fourth quarter of 2024, aligning with the expected timing of the next halving.\n\nBitcoin price action looks similar to the 2015-2017 pre-bull run phase\n\nThe report also suggests that the current market environment shares striking similarities with the period between 2015 and 2017. The alignment of market behavior, economic indicators and historical trends indicates that the current phase is akin to a time of increased risk exposure and potential growth, just as was experienced during that period.\n\nThe report notes that the market\u2019s trading patterns, especially in the S&P 500, closely resemble the trajectory observed during 2015-2017. Even during times of uncertainty, such as an earnings recession, these patterns persist, mirroring the sentiment of that period.\n\nThe consistent pattern of Bitcoin\u2019s cycle, its synchronization with broader economic shifts and the imminent halving in 2024 all contribute to this thesis.\n\nU.S. ISM Manufacturing Index, current (orange) vs. 2013-2019 cycle (white). Source: Delphi Digital\n\nDelphi highlights parallels between the bleak global growth outlook during 2015-2016 and the recent period of economic uncertainty in 2021-2022. Factors such as the strength of the U.S. dollar and changes in global liquidity cycles echo the past.\n\nThe report underscores how gold\u2019s performance around that time, influenced by currency debasement concerns, exhibits remarkable similarities to the present. These parallels bolster the argument that macroeconomic conditions are following a familiar trajectory.\n\nGold price in USD (log scale), current (orange) vs. 2015-2019 cycle (white). Source: Delphi Digital\n\nRelated: Is Bitcoin\u2019s record-low volatility and decline in short-term holders a bull market signal?\n\nThe crypto market reflects an optimistic outlook, with some red flags\n\nDelphi\u2019s analysis provides compelling evidence that the crypto market operates within cyclical patterns that mirror broader economic changes. The report\u2019s prediction of a new all-time high by the fourth quarter of 2024 aligns with historical halving patterns. This timing, coupled with the state of indicators like the ISM and expectations of renewed liquidity cycles, strengthens the argument for a cycle akin to the one seen in 2015-2017.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 further adds credence to the firm's expectations of a possible bull market by the fourth quarter of that year. While the analysis is not without its risks and uncertainties, the overall outlook for the cryptocurrency market in the next 12-18 months appears promising, given the stacking catalysts and historical precedent.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "SEC delays set deadlines for Bitcoin ETF approval to early 2024 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u2014 the financial regulator with the final say over allowing a spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2014 may be moving closer to giving the investment vehicle the green light after several years of applications.\n\nIn June, the world\u2019s largest asset management firm, BlackRock, added its application to the bundle of Bitcoin (BTC) ETF filings currently being reviewed by the SEC, creating renewed interest among investors in and out of the crypto space. The company later added a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase following reports the SEC could be more open to accepting an ETF application under such conditions.\n\nBlackRock is one of many firms with crypto ETF applications in the SEC pipeline. ARK Invest, under CEO Cathie Wood, filed to list its ARK 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF in May 2023 and received the most recent delay from the SEC on Aug. 11, pushing back the deadline another 21 days as the regulator opens the proposal to public comments.\n\nUnder SEC guidelines, the federal regulator has the authority to delay ETF applications for up to 240 days \u2014 by opening them to public comment or otherwise \u2014 from the first filing in the Federal Register. Even so, the SEC has never approved a spot Bitcoin ETF proposal from any firm in the United States and only started accepting investment vehicles tied to BTC futures in October 2021.\n\nOne of the challenges behind getting the SEC to allow a spot crypto ETF may be the nature of the investment vehicle. Bitcoin futures-linked ETFs also enable individuals and companies to invest in the crypto asset without an exchange, while a spot BTC ETF could involve holding Bitcoin within a fund for more direct investment.\n\nGemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were the first to apply for a crypto exchange-traded product listing using their Bitcoin Trust in July 2013, when many regulators might not have even understood digital currencies and the SEC ultimately rejected the application.\n\nStuart Barton, co-founder and chief investment officer of Volatility Shares \u2014 the firm behind the listing of a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF in June \u2014 told Cointelegraph its process of applying with the SEC involved back-and-forth negotiations. The regulator proposed changes to disclosure documents but was generally \u201ccooperative.\u201d He speculated that smaller firms might have more of an edge with the SEC on a spot crypto ETF offering.\n\n\u201cBig companies have been doing the same thing they\u2019ve been doing for years,\u201d said Barton. \u201cYeah, there are new applications, new filings\u2026 they haven\u2019t really moved the argument along.\u201d\n\nAt the time of publication, major asset management firms with spot Bitcoin ETF applications under review by the SEC include BlackRock, ARK Invest, Bitwise Asset Management, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco and Galaxy Digital, Fidelity and Valkyrie. With the maximum 240-day extension window available to the SEC, the final deadline for ARK\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is in January 2024, while approval or disapproval of all the other firms\u2019 offerings could come as late as March 2024.\n\nRelated: SEC decision on Bitcoin ETFs won\u2019t leave out Wall Street giants\n\nPart of the SEC\u2019s seeming reluctance to sign off on a spot crypto ETF could be from the nature of the crypto market in the United States, which, while regulated, has left many lawmakers and industry leaders calling for greater clarity and oversight. The SEC is currently pursuing enforcement cases against Coinbase, Binance and Ripple, and it has already levied financial penalties against firms such as Bittrex. Barton added:\n\n\u201cBoth sides are going to bend a little bit. I think the SEC are going to have to be a little bit more open-minded [...] There\u2019s going to be a lot more bending, I think, from the crypto side.\u201d\n\nU.S. lawmakers are currently considering legislation to better define the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should have in regulating digital assets. In addition, both the regulator and industry may have to consider court decisions until regulations are better defined, as a judge in the SEC vs. Ripple case largely ruled that XRP was not a security, creating ramifications for everyone dealing with crypto in the United States.\n\n\u201c[The ETF application process] puts the SEC in an incredibly powerful position,\u201d said Barton. \u201cGensler has a great amount of sway in that; the political makeup of the commission definitely influences that.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?\n\nAs of August, certain analysts have suggested that the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved in the U.S. are close to 65% based partly on BlackRock\u2019s application. Both Cathie Wood and Grayscale \u2014 the asset manager currently suing the SEC over its ETF application \u2014 have hinted that the regulator could approve multiple applications simultaneously to avoid any company having an advantage over another."

        "title": "Is Bitcoin's record-low volatility and decline in short-term holders a bull market signal? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The latest report from Glassnode Insights, titled \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\" emphasizes that Bitcoin has reached historically low levels of volatility. This has led to a mere 2.9% separation between the asset\u2019s Bollinger Bands, indicating an exceptionally narrow trading range.\n\nThis situation has only been observed twice in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) history: in September 2016, when BTC traded near $604, and in January 2023, when the asset maintained a steady value of $16,800.\n\nAs outlined in the report, periods of reduced volatility, combined with investor fatigue, prompt the movement of coins based on their cost close to the current price. This implies that traders are likely making marginal profits or losses with their exits. The report concludes that establishing a new price range is necessary to stimulate fresh spending, potentially contributing to an anticipated increase in volatility.\n\nIs Bitcoin\u2019s low volatility a reflection of broader markets?\n\nThe constrained range within which Bitcoin has traded \u2014 specifically, $29,050 to $29,775 over the past three weeks \u2014 is atypical, and it does not require advanced mathematical analysis to understand. This has resulted in an exceptionally low annualized 30-day volatility of 17%. The key question is whether this trend is isolated to cryptocurrencies or if it's a phenomenon also observed in the traditional markets, including stocks, oil, bonds and currencies.\n\nS&P 500 (blue), WTI (green), DXY (orange), 10-year Treasury (purple) 30-day volatility. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice how the S&P 500 and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price 30-day volatility are currently at their lowest levels since November 2021. Interestingly, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) didn't follow this trend, as the metric rose to 8% from 6% in May 2023. Additionally, the 10-year Treasury yield\u2019s 30-day volatility recently rose from its 18-month low of around 10% to the current 16%. These trends could have potentially influenced the decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s volatility.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, there\u2019s a significant concentration of short-term holders\u2019 price distribution between $25,000 and $31,000. This pattern is reminiscent of similar periods during past bear market recoveries. However, the data shows that many of these investors are still holding positions with losses, creating short-term selling pressure.\n\nEntity-adjusted unspent BTC realized price distribution. Source: Glassnode\n\nMoreover, the analytics firm highlights a noteworthy drop in short-term holder supply to a multiyear low of 2.56 million BTC. On the flip side, the supply held by long-term holders has reached an all-time high of 14.6 million BTC, as mentioned in the report.\n\nBitcoin long-term and short-term holder threshold. Source: Glassnode\n\nAssuming a relatively optimistic scenario where only 10% of the 1.77 million BTC held by long-term investors at $47,000 or higher change their positions before Bitcoin surpasses $40,000, this amounts to about six and a half months of the current mining output. This illustrates the importance of not disregarding the potential impact of a global economic recession on Bitcoin\u2019s price, beyond the fact that short-term holders are becoming scarce.\n\nThis hypothesis doesn\u2019t invalidate Glassnode\u2019s idea of increased positions by \u201clong-term conviction holders.\" Nevertheless, no historical data can account for the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields nearing their highest level in 16 years or the 30-year fixed average mortgage rate in the United States flirting with the 7% mark.\n\nDespite the current trend, long-term holders still could flip their sentiment and actions in the event of adverse economic conditions.\n\nHigher yields in equities could attract investors, leading to possible volatility, while rising government and corporate borrowing costs might strain budgets and profitability. Concurrently, real estate markets might slow due to the impact on mortgage affordability. Such circumstances would likely compel central banks to implement fiscal policies to support economic activity, often resulting in upward inflation pressure.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s ascension as a $50 billion asset class occurred merely six years ago, making it uncertain how holders will react to the stress faced by some traditional markets. This contradicts the historically low volatility in the S&P 500, oil and Bitcoin markets.\n\nThis raises the question: Could this tranquility be preceding a period of turmoil, and will Bitcoin serve as a hedge against escalating inflation? Only time will provide the answers.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "But not everyone\u2019s on board with the crypto ETF train. Critics argue that Bitcoin-linked ETFs could be even worse than centralized exchanges for the crypto market. Their main beef? There\u2019s zero possibility of withdrawing the underlying instrument. This means the holders are never able to take advantage of the single most important feature of Bitcoin: the ability to control their funds without a need to trust anyone.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just talk. The potential of these investment vehicles is already being realized in markets like Canada. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF, for example, raked in over $400 million in assets under management within just two days of its launch. It\u2019s no longer a question of whether crypto is an asset class.\n\nIt\u2019s like a starter pistol has been fired, and the institutional investors are off to the races, setting the stage for a seismic shift in the financial landscape, with crypto ETFs as the starting block.\n\nCrypto ETFs unleash a domino effect\n\nETFs are a huge business. BlackRock alone managed circa $3 trillion in client assets in ETFs at the end of March 2023 across a range of stocks, bonds and commodities.\n\nThe approval of crypto ETFs indicates more than just mainstream acceptance \u2014 it can drive market maturity, establish price stability and foster innovation, leading to the creation of ETFs for a broader range of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, similar to how the approval of the first ETF in 1993 led to a diverse range of ETFs today.\n\nRelated: BlackRock\u2019s misguided effort to create \u2018Crypto for Dummies\u2019\n\nBut not everyone\u2019s on board with the crypto ETF train. Critics argue that Bitcoin-linked ETFs could be even worse than centralized exchanges for the crypto market. Their main beef? There\u2019s zero possibility of withdrawing the underlying instrument. This means the holders are never able to take advantage of the single most important feature of Bitcoin: the ability to control their funds without a need to trust anyone.\n\nWith the potential to become as mainstream as their stock or bond counterparts, crypto ETFs could usher in a diverse range of investors. But the real disruptive element? Institutional-grade custody.\n\nRace for crypto ETFs fuels the impetus for institutional custody\n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not just the custody technology that is disruptive but also the investor protection standards imposed on licensed custodians. As traditional financial institutions take the plunge and launch crypto-related trading products in the United States, the demand for institutional-grade custody solutions is skyrocketing. Early August alone saw six major asset managers file applications to launch Ether (ETH) futures ETFs to U.S. customers.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s expansion into crypto this past year has been bolstered by its partnership with Coinbase, which, according to filings, would be in charge of safekeeping the Bitcoin in the BlackRock ETF and provide market surveillance to reduce fraud and market manipulation.\n\nThe crypto custody market itself is expanding rapidly. According to Markets and Markets, the crypto custody market was worth an estimated $223 billion in January 2022, up from $32 billion in January 2019. And it\u2019s not slowing down anytime soon, with estimates predicting a compound annual growth rate of 26.7% through 2028.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nThe complexity and risk associated with a broader range of digital assets necessitate robust custodial services. As we transition into Custody 3.0 \u2014 an era characterized by active participation in the decentralized economy \u2014 these services are evolving to include connectivity to on-chain services and DeFi applications. The key for digital asset custodians is to build on existing infrastructure and offer comprehensive services to monetize digital assets within a high-standard operational framework.\n\nIn this context, fully licensed digital asset custodians become trusted partners, enabling financial institutions to integrate digital assets into their business operations in a safe, scalable, compliant manner.\n\nRegulatory hurdles and triumphs\n\nIt\u2019s been a brutal stretch for the crypto industry since the market peak in late 2021, but the frenzy of crypto ETF filings from Wall Street\u2019s biggest names has shown that this corner of the market is generating attention.\n\nRegulation remains the biggest hurdle in the United States. Various fund companies have been trying for years to get crypto ETFs approved, only to be rejected over concerns of fraud and market manipulation.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all gloom on the regulatory front. Outside of the U.S., we\u2019re seeing a global trend toward clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets. It\u2019s like a regulatory domino effect, paving the way for the creation of strategic digital asset hubs in locations such as Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and Europe. The implementation of these frameworks will not only accommodate the growth and diversity of the crypto market but also increase transparency and investor protection, benefiting both the industry and its participants. And as they become more robust, they\u2019re laying the groundwork for investment vehicles like crypto ETFs, further fuelling institutional demand.\n\nWith Hong Kong recently debuting retail crypto trading via licensed exchanges, it may not be long before we see the first spot crypto ETF in Asia.\n\nGradually, then suddenly\n\nThe domino effect triggered by crypto ETFs is not just a shift \u2014 it\u2019s a revolution. It\u2019s an impending transformation that will redefine the financial landscape. And it\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s about the potential for a more inclusive, transparent and efficient financial system that paves the way for broader market access.\n\nSo, the question is not whether to embrace the crypto revolution to get ahead but rather how to do so effectively or risk getting left behind. The dominos are falling. The time to act is now.\n\nCalvin Shen has more than 10 years of financial services and investment experience across fintech startups and asset management.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether are trading pretty flat after a relatively uneventful weekend for crypto. Joining us now to discuss this is Athena head of research and data Connor, writer, welcome Connor. Hey Lawrence, thanks for having me. Glad to have you on. So, uh we haven't seen much movement in the majors and Bitcoin. You see a potential here for the ALTs. Are we seeing that necessarily in market dominance? What's going on uh for the ALTs the like? So she knows some of these uh uh you know, more meme coins, things like that. Yeah. Well, look for, yeah, we're seeing kind of open interest for eyes for she, but we're seeing a bit of interest start to pick up. But as far as all coins are concerned, really, I think if we're going to see any movement in all coins, we really need to see a Bitcoin or Ethereum led rally to start with. Um and I think we're a while away from that. Obviously, there's a lot of old coins that kind of have securities regulatory risk overhanging them. Um But yeah, as I said, we're going to need to kind of see a Bitcoin or Ethereum price move, which we just have an ad over the last two or three weeks. There's actually been remarkable lack of volatility really in markets, which is, which is pretty crazy for crypto assets to be honest. But um I think what we're seeing is kind of investor apathy starting to seek to seep into markets right now. Investors are kind of looking around for that next catalyst, whatever that may be. Um Otherwise they'll kind of keep their money on the sidelines. We're seeing that just in like retail volumes in July was the lowest um in terms of monthly volume we've seen since November 2020. Um last Friday, in fact was a, was a low for Bitcoin volume this year daily volume. And so yeah, we're kind of seeing that a bit into markets right now and there's a handful of catalysts that could lift us out of this. But otherwise we're kind of, yeah, we're expecting, I guess more subdued markets in the near term until one of those catalysts hits. So some of the catalyst, you know, we keep talking about a potential Bitcoin ETF for for a few weeks away from knowing whether or not that will happen. But we're also seeing in the process, um the adoption of stable coins by paypal. Uh are those, are those two things that can coexist or does one kind of take the thunder from the other? In other words, if we see paypal adopt stable coins does that sort of take away this interest and excitement around a, um, Cryptocurrency that can be used across borders? I mean, here you have paypal that would create a, or, you know, basically sponsor a, a stable coin that could be used to cross borders. I, you know, I guess, I guess the question is, does the paypal News offset? Actually the ETF news, does it actually have a little bit of a, an injury to it rather than a uh a help? I don't think so. I think the two can coexist pretty easily. Um And basically because I think they target two different sectors of really crypto markets. And if we take the paypal first, that I think is really great for like retail adoption, right? That's been talked about obviously ad nauseum for the last few days, but paypal has over 400 million users that all those users are getting on boarded into the, right. It's tough to remember a bigger kind of on board moment for crypto. Um And if you were to ask for like a web two centralized issuer that would back a stable coin and put their name behind. But paypal is arguably one of the better ones to, to do they obviously payments as their bread and butter stable coins have long had issues with having access to kind of payment rails, right? So usually stable coins and crypto are kind of used for buying other crypto assets on exchanges whereas now we're actually seeing a new kind of market being opened for stable coins as payments, right? So um if you take ebay, for example, 70% of ebay transactions use paypal. So now all of a sudden, you've got about 70% of ebay transactions have the option to use stable coins. And so that's and then obviously you have the on and off around the capabilities of paypal. Crypto is also long struggled. And especially lately with fiat and off ramps, we've seen particularly some us exchanges struggle um to kind of and we've seen them temporarily suspend us d deposits and withdrawals. Now this hopefully solves a large portion of that those issues. Um So that's the kind of paypal side of things and that's really great for retail adoption. I have other views on whether or not the staple coin actually moves the needle itself um in terms of kind of centralization worries. But then if you take this O ETF, that's kind of targeting a whole another sector of the market, in my opinion, really, it's targeting investment funds institutions that currently so basically what we have now is futures. ETF S and futures ETF S essentially is a good way to kind of light your money on fire in terms of paying fees, paying fees to middle men. And the average kind of essentially when you have expiring futures like these futures. ETF S are built upon, you have to roll into a new contract once that expires and there's historically been premium and that's paid for essentially in fees. So you're looking at about 10 to 12% fees for futures ETF S and compared to actually holding the actual spot ETF itself, so there'd be a big improvement for the institutions there. And that should see a kind of new wave of, of, of institutional money coming in. And if you look at the kind of futures ETF S right now, they just underperform Bitcoin. So year to date the top um Bitcoin Futures ETF is pro shares and they, the year to date their performance being 45% compare that to Bitcoin 75%. So we're near, we're nearly seeing them by 30% under performance there with futures ETF S. So no institution really, that's where their money is happy about investing in that futures. ETF whereas the spot TF will see them kind of their interest peaked, I guess so. No, to go back to your original question to me, they kind of they're responsible for two different sectors of the market. One is great for kind of retail adoption and one should be really good for institutional adoption as well. Connor, thank you very much for joining the show this morning. Happy Monday. Thank you guys. Thanks for having me. That was Athena's head of research and Data Conor Rider."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Solana - What's the Difference? - Securities.io",
        "content": "There are a lot of reasons why so many people seek to learn the crucial differences between Bitcoin and Solana. These networks are among the top options for traders with both being listed on major CEXs and having a strong following. So how does the world's first cryptocurrency stack up against a third-gen powerhouse? Here's some valuable insight into Bitcoin vs. Solana.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was the first successful attempt at making a reliable and secure decentralized currency. The network changed the world forever when Satoshi Nakamoto published the now-famous Whitepaper in 2008. The paper described how a network of nodes could act as the validation system rather than leveraging a central group like a bank.\n\nBitcoin filled a need in the market for a permissionless electronic peer-to-peer cash system. Now, Bitcoin has seen its use-case shift from day-to-day spending to include store-of-value purposes. The network has seen considerable growth with an all-time high of over $68,000.\n\nToday, Bitcoin has started to regain some of its day-to-day currency capabilities thanks to new technologies such as the lightning network. This off-chain protocol enables Bitcoiners to cheaply send up to 1,000,000 tps \u2013 which is significantly faster than the mainnet. This development has helped Bitcoin stay relevant in a market with increasingly capable competitors.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana is a third-generation programmable blockchain. The network is the brainchild of Anatoly Yakovenko who founded Solana in 2017. At that time, the focus on the market was to introduce a programmable blockchain that could outperform Ethereum and provide more scalability.\n\nSolana entered the market to fulfill these goals. The platform was a hit with developers due to its open infrastructure. Additionally, traders enjoyed its low fees and high performance. Today, Solana is a vibrant blockchain community that features a combination of DEXs, DeFi, and Dapps.\n\nWhat Problems Was Bitcoin Built to Alleviate?\n\nGiven that no one knows the Bitcoin founder directly, one can only speculate on Bitcoin's true purpose. In the coin's whitepaper, Nakamoto states that the protocol would operate as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Aside from its technical purpose, there are some higher levels of purpose that Bitcoin fulfills.\n\nNakamoto hints at some of the coin's goals such as providing a more transparent and fair option to the market. In the Bitcoin genesis block, which is the first block of its blockchain, Nakamoto embeds a reference to the Bank of England receiving a massive bailout. This reference can be seen as a clue as to one of the reasons why Nakamoto created this game-changing invention.\n\nBitcoin opens the world for a global economy using digital currency. The expansion of the internet has made this concept even more possible than ever before. Bitcoin remains a pioneer in terms of freedom and openness in the market. Its community still holds the torch regarding fulfilling Nakamoto's dream of a fair economy for all.\n\nWhat Problems Was Solana Built to Alleviate?\n\nWhen Solana entered the market scalability concerns were wreaking havoc on networks. Ethereum and Bitcoin were suffering from crushing congestion that made both networks nearly unusable. There were instances when it cost more to send these tokens than the actual amount you were trying to send.\n\nThis congestion left Dapp developers and users in search of more scalable alternatives. This is the time when Solana entered the market. Cryptocurrencies were in a breakout year with the introduction of the ERC-20 token standard and the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) craze. Solana entered the market to fill a need for a high-performance programmable network.\n\nThe network integrated a new consensus mechanism that improved its performance considerably compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin can handle around 7 tps on its mainnet. In comparison, Solana has been bench tested to 29,171 tps. Part of this performance comes from the improved block times. Bitcoin has a 10min block approval time. Solana approves blocks every 2.34 seconds. Additionally, the developers were sure to leave room for the network to scale vertically in the future to meet growing demands.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nBitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to operate. This system eliminates central groups and replaces them with network nodes called miners. These participants are responsible for approving blocks of transactions every ten minutes. Once approved, these blocks get added to the chain of transactions to form the blockchain.\n\nWhile all miners approve transactions, only one receives the rewards. The reward is given to the miner that is the first to figure out a complex mathematical equation called SHA-256. This equation is so difficult that your computer concludes it's easier to make random guesses than do the actual computations.\n\nWhen you hear about Bitcoin miners, these are devices that are built to complete this equation faster. Today's Bitcoin network miners use advanced ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Chips) that are thousands of times better at solving the SHA-256 equation versus your PC.\n\nBTC\n\nBTC is a cryptocurrency that operates on the Bitcoin network. As the first cryptocurrency, BTCs first technical purpose was to act as digital money. Consequently, it's limited in its technical capabilities versus today's advanced networks. Notably, there are only 21M Bitcoin slated for issuance.\n\nHow Does Solana Work?\n\nSolana is a third-generation blockchain that employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus system to remain valid. This style of blockchain does away with miners and replaces them with stakers. Stakers agree to lock their tokens in a smart contract to participate in the approval process.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it's more environmentally sustainable, doesn\u2019t require expensive equipment, and is designed to be more democratic. Anyone can use their tokens to secure rewards. The downside of staking networks is that they are not as proven as PoW networks like Bitcoin, which have over a decade of secure operations, and are known to suffer from outages.\n\nSolana integrates an additional timestamp into its blocks of transactions which improves referencing. The cryptographic clock means that nodes don\u2019t have to approve the entire state of the blockchain every time. They can leverage these snapshots to improve performance, which acts as another layer of validation.\n\nSOL\n\nSOL is the main utility token for the Solana network. This advanced token serves multiple roles in the ecosystem. For one, it's used to pay transactions and smart contract execution fees. It can also be used to send value globally. Token holders can stake SOL to gain passive rewards.\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL)\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) are each available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nBitcoin vs. Solana\n\nNow that you have more insight into the Bitcoin vs. Solana discussion, you're more informed and prepared to make your decision. Both networks have strong followings and a bright future. Bitcoin has proven to be the industry leader with a secure network, but Solana has its mainnet beat in terms of capabilities and performance. For these reasons, both networks are a smart addition to your portfolio. You can learn more about Bitcoin and Solana via the links."

        "title": "Monero (XME) Cryptocurrency: Definition, Mining, Vs. Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Monero (XMR) Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrencies are increasing in popularity. These are virtual or digital currencies that are decentralized and can be used to trade or spend using blockchain technology. Many of them are aimed to enhance privacy and anonymity, and whether they achieve success is unpredictable. A few of these currencies allow public viewing of all transactions, while others make privacy optional. And still, others keep the privacy feature strictly implicit.\n\nWhen most of us think of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is usually the first one that comes to mind. It was one of the first of its kind, using peer-to-peer technology to allow users to make payments with their coins. But there's another currency that has achieved a high level of popularity and acceptance, mainly for its privacy-oriented features. This one is called Monero. This article explains the key concepts, features, and challenges of Monero.\n\nKey Takeaways Monero is an open-source, privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that was launched in 2014.\n\nIts blockchain is opaque, which makes transaction details and the amount of every transaction anonymous by disguising the addresses used by participants.\n\nInvestors can mine Monero using their own CPUs, which means they don't need to pay for special hardware.\n\nIts privacy features make Monero easy to use for illicit activities as well as for use on the dark web.\n\nUnderstanding Monero (XMR) Cryptocurrency\n\nMonero (XMR) is an open-source, privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that was launched in 2014. It is built and operates on the concept. These blockchains, which form the underlying technology behind digital currencies, are public ledgers of participants' activities that show all the transactions on the network.\n\nMonero's blockchain is intentionally configured to be opaque. It makes transaction details, like the identity of senders and recipients, and the amount of every transaction, anonymous by disguising the addresses used by participants.\n\nAlong with anonymity, the mining process for Monero is based on an egalitarian concept. This is the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal opportunities. Its developers did not keep any stake for themselves when they launched Monero but they did bank on contributions and community support to further develop the virtual currency.\n\nAs of Aug. 26, 2023, Monero was trading at $146.22 and had a market capitalization of $2.68 billion. That's a big difference from the closing price of $89.12 on Aug. 26, 2020. The market cap on that date was $1.58 billion.\n\nHow Is Monero Different from Bitcoin?\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency on the market. It works on a protocol that attempts to shield the participant's identity using pseudo name addresses. These pseudo names are randomly generated combinations of alphabets and numbers.\n\nBut this approach offers limited privacy as both Bitcoin addresses and transactions are registered on the blockchain, opening them to public access. Even pseudonymous addresses are not fully private. A few transactions carried on by a participant over time can be linked to the same address, allowing the possibility of others to become aware of an address owner's trends and their identity.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAnother advantage of Monero over bitcoin is fungibility. This means that two units of a currency can be mutually substituted with no difference between them. While two $1 bills are equal in value, they are not fungible, as each carries a unique serial number. In contrast, two one-ounce gold bars of the same grade are fungible, as both have the same value and don\u2019t carry any distinguishing features. Using this analogy, a bitcoin is the $1 bill, while a Monero is that piece of gold.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe transaction history of each bitcoin is recorded on the blockchain. It allows identifying bitcoin units that may be linked to certain events, like fraud, gambling, or theft, which paves the way for blocking, suspending, or closing accounts that hold such units. Imagine receiving a few bitcoins today that were previously used for gambling, and they are banned in the future, leading to a loss.\n\nMonero has a non-traceable transaction history, which offers participants a much safer network where they don\u2019t run the risk of having their held units be refused or blacklisted by others.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nMonero is among the top 30 most popular cryptocurrencies in the industry.\n\nHow Does Monero Improve Privacy?\n\nMonero alleviates privacy concerns using the concepts of ring signatures and stealth addresses. Ring signatures enable a sender to conceal their identity from other participants in a group. Ring signatures are anonymous digital signatures from one member of the group, but they don\u2019t reveal which member signs a transaction.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nTo generate a ring signature, the Monero platform uses a combination of a sender\u2019s account keys and clubs it with public keys on the blockchain. This makes it unique as well as private. It hides the sender's identity, as it is computationally impossible to ascertain which of the group members' keys was used to produce the complex signature.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nStealth addresses add additional privacy, as these randomly generated addresses for one-time use are created for each transaction on behalf of the recipient. The use of these stealth addresses enables concealing the actual destination address of a transaction, and it hides the identity of the receiving participant.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nRing Confidential Transactions, or RingCT, also enable hiding the amount of a transaction. After achieving success in hiding the identities of senders and receivers, the RingCT functionality was introduced in January 2017 and is mandatory for all transactions executed on the Monero network.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nMonero's Challenges\n\nWhile privacy fuels the rapid adoption of Monero, it also brings with it several challenges. For instance, the non-traceability and privacy features allow them to be used for disreputable purposes and at questionable marketplaces, including those like drugs and gambling. This is one of the reasons why markets that were popular on the dark web, like AlphaBay and Oasis, showed increased use of Monero before they were shut down.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nReports by CNBC cite the case of hackers creating malicious software that infected computers to mine Monero and send it to North Korea. Monero is essentially open to be used for illicit activities and for evading law enforcement, as it remains outside of capital controls with no traceability.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nHow to Mine Monero\n\nMonero runs on all leading OS platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD. The currency supports a mining process where individuals get rewarded for their activities by joining mining pools, or they can mine coins individually.\n\nMonero mining can be performed on a standard computer and does not need any specific hardware such as the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). An ASIC is a costly form of hardware that is commonly used to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Instead, you can use the CPU or GPU of your own computer to mine the currency. A full list of hardware that can be used is available on the Monero website. Users can also install certain software, which may cost a developer fee.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAccording to the company's website, Monero relies on proof-of-work mining.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff This is an algorithm that provides security to certain cryptocurrencies like Monero. This system prevents problems surrounding double-spending, which can skew the supply, showing there's much more than actually available.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nPurchasing the currency is as easy as going on an exchange or looking for a seller who's willing to unload their supply. You can also buy Monero through an automated teller machine (ATM) that is enabled for cryptocurrencies.\n\nYou don't need any special hardware to mine Monero. The currency runs on all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD\n\nIs Monero Illegal? Monero is not an illegal cryptocurrency. Unlike others, it is a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that provides users with anonymity. This means it is not traceable. This characteristic, however, does make it very popular on the darknet and for use with certain activities such as gambling and the sale of drugs.\n\nIs Monero a Good Investment? If you're interested in cryptocurrencies, Monero may be a good investment. The price of the currency jumped more than 64% between Aug. 26, 2020, and Aug. 26, 2023. Additionally, it doesn't cost much to start, as you don't need any special hardware. You can actually use the CPU of your own computer to mine it, and Monero works with all major operating systems. This will save you a lot of money in fees and charges.\n\nWhere Can I Buy Monero? You can purchase Monero through a digital or virtual currency exchange. Or you can search for an individual seller or an ATM enabled for cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Mine One Monero? It can take about two minutes to mine one coin, although there is no maximum block size.\n\nCan XMR Be Traced? Monero, or XMR, is untraceable. Unlike other coins, such as Bitcoin, Monero has a non-traceable transaction history. This characteristic offers participants a much safer network where they don\u2019t run the risk of having their held units be refused or blacklisted by others.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCryptocurrencies are a very popular investment for many people. But the popularity\u2014and price\u2014of Bitcoin may be a turnoff. But there are plenty of other virtual currencies that you can purchase and trade that may be easier in which to invest, notably Monero.\n\nThe privacy-rich attributes have helped Monero become a recognizable cryptocurrency and one to keep an eye on. Investors can trade in Monero on leading cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken, Poloniex, and Bitfinex. However, it's important to remember that what makes Monero so popular\u2014namely, its privacy features\u2014can also lead to some major challenges, such as its use in illegal activities.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs. Since each individual's situation is unique, a qualified professional should always be consulted before making any financial decisions.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Moving Sideways: BTC Could Fall to $11000 - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin has been moving sideways since July 24\n\nIf the level holds a move to $35,200 could be seen\n\nBut if the level breaks, it could signal a larger downtrend to $11,000\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been moving sideways since July 24, when it fell to $29,000. It has been hovering around $30,000 with low volume and volatility and formed a horizontal range.\n\nWith its July 13 high of $31,730 being the yearly high, could this sideways movement be interpreted as redistribution before a significant move? And if so, where is Bitcoin likely headed?\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nFrom November 21 when the price fell to $15,500, we have seen the start of an uptrend that recovered it by 105% measured to its highest point in July. An ascending channel formed, which is typical for an uptrend.\n\nFrom June 14 it retested the ascending channels support level and bounced from it once more at $24,820 making another higher high. July high was only a minor one with a 4.5% difference from the prior one made in mid-April.\n\nSome cryptocurrencies didn\u2019t make a new higher high in July compared to April\u2019s, like Ethereum, Binance coin, Cardano, and so on.\n\nThis minor difference shows us that momentum is slowing down as with each push, buyers have less strength, and taking into account that generally speaking, the market as a whole (total cryptocurrency market capitalization) hasn\u2019t reached a new yearly high in July, we can definitely conclude the diminishing momentum.\n\nThe sideways range from July 24, came after the price made a dip below the $30,000 mark and now we are seeing yet another interaction with the ascending channel support level.\n\nIf a breakout occurs to the downside, which looks highly likely, that could be an early signal of the starting downtrend.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nIn some of our previous analyses, we have pointed out that the price of Bitcoin has two scenarios in play \u2013 a bullish one and a bearish one. In a bullish case, the price is going to make a final attempt to continue its uptrend resulting in another higher high and is then headed for its first major correction to $20,000.\n\nAlternatively, according to a bearish scenario, July high marked the completion of a bear market correction and is now headed to a new bear market low of potentially $11,000.\n\nConsidering the negative context we are currently in let\u2019s revisit the bearish scenario.\n\nOn the daily log chart above from Coinbase, we can see that the price made a corrective Elliott Wave count of 3 waves until November 21, from mid-April 2021. The main difference between a bullish and a bearish scenario is whether or not the bear market ended in November as an ABC correction of the highest degree. Looking at the sub-waves the possibility of we are in wave 4 from the higher degree wave C on the rise from June 18, 2022, is high.\n\n\n\nThis is so because from June 18 there was some positive price action but it resulted in a lower low in November, and the wave structure from August to November doesn\u2019t appear to have been the ending bear market wave.\n\nInstead, according to this count, the rise from November until now is the third sub-wave of the ABC correction from June 18, 2022.\n\nIf this is true, then a larger descending move could now lead the price of Bitcoin to a final bear market low.\n\nSince Bitcoin already fell below its previous bull market ATH, it is likely to continue down to its next significant support point on the expected downfall which is around $11,000.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs stated, there is also a bullish case to be made, in which the price started its bull cycle on November 21. If that scenario is in play, the price should now make a final higher high to $35,200 before falling back down to $20,000 on its first major correction.\n\nThis is why the currently seen interaction with the ascending channel support level is going to be important.\n\nIf the level gets broken and the price starts falling down, then the likelihood of a bearish scenario increases. But if the level holds and we see a bounce, the price will likely be headed toward the $35,000 zone."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. gold: Are market cap and other comparisons actually relevant for investors? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The connection between Bitcoin and gold goes back to Bitcoin\u2019s origin. While it is not mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto actually referred to gold\u2019s rarity in a Bitcointalk forum post when introducing the first version of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2009. This was to emphasize the importance of a limited supply of 21 million coins.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market value is frequently matched up against gold, which boasts a total worth of $12.8 trillion, and many crypto pundits often point to the approval of a gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2004 as the catalyst for the asset\u2019s price appreciation.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin encounters resistance at the $30,000 mark, and its inability to surpass this level could lie in how institutional investors perceive the comparison of BTC and gold as stores of value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s present market cap of $570 billion outshines traditional giants like Visa, Taiwan Semiconductor and JPMorgan Chase. However, it\u2019s still 55% behind silver and significantly trails the world\u2019s foremost tradable asset, gold.\n\nThis raises a crucial question: How closely are the prices of these two assets linked? In simpler terms, do their prices actually have a noticeable connection?\n\nGold prices in USD and correlation vs. Bitcoin (orange). Source: TradingView\n\nThe explanation becomes clear when considering Bitcoin's heightened volatility. For example, the 30-day correlation indicator can shift from positive to negative within a matter of weeks. This lack of consistent price connection can be attributed to Bitcoin\u2019s relatively modest adoption and the uncertainty that investors still grapple with concerning its potential and practical applications.\n\nInvestors and analysts continue to debate whether Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and limited supply validate its role as a financial reserve, while others counter that its price instability hinders its viability as a medium of exchange. Nonetheless, there\u2019s no barrier to evaluating Bitcoin\u2019s market cap alongside major global stocks and other commodities.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market capitalization relative to gold. Source: TradingView and Cointelegraph\n\nExamining Bitcoin\u2019s market cap in comparison to gold unveils an interesting trend, highlighting resistance levels at 10% and 4.5%, which could potentially explain the $30,000 resistance.\n\nBitcoin investment products vs. gold ETF\n\nAccording to CryptoCompare, investment vehicles linked to Bitcoin amassed a total of $24 billion in July. This encompasses products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and exchange-traded notes from various providers. This translates to about 4.2% of Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap of $570 billion. Even considering the more generous estimate of 1.66 million BTC reportedly held by institutional investors, that\u2019s still only 8.5% of the total market cap.\n\nComparatively, gold-backed ETF products were valued at $215 billion in June, a mere 1.7% of gold\u2019s market cap. However, for a fair assessment against Bitcoin, it is worth considering physical gold holdings, which are favored by governments and banks. At the same time, regulations often push fund managers toward exchange-listed BTC products, causing this discrepancy.\n\nFor instance, central banks and the International Monetary Fund hold a hefty 46,603 tonnes of gold, equivalent to $2.84 trillion. Private investments in bars and coins add 45,000 tonnes, worth an extra $2.74 trillion. In total, investors hold $5.8 trillion in gold, accounting for 45.2% of its market cap.\n\nThis analysis implies Bitcoin\u2019s adoption as a store of value among institutional investors is around 81% smaller than gold. This partly explains why Bitcoin\u2019s market cap of $570 billion is a substantial 95.5% lower than that of gold, the dominant precious metal.\n\nRelated: PayPal to roll out Cryptocurrencies Hub for select users\n\nBitcoin could succeed regardless of its use as a store of value\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cap could potentially multiply fivefold, reaching $2.9 trillion, even without complete adoption as an institutional store of value. This surge might stem from the escalating demand for decentralized digital trading. With conventional financial systems encountering hurdles, Bitcoin\u2019s role as a global, censorship-resistant transaction medium gains prominence.\n\nMoreover, its increasing integration into e-commerce and online markets could amplify transaction volumes. As individuals seek alternatives to traditional payments, Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and utility might establish a self-reinforcing value cycle. This distinctive blend of factors implies that Bitcoin\u2019s price surge may not exclusively hinge on institutional adoption as a store of value.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nYet another high-profile politician is backing Bitcoin.\n\nIn an unexpected victory, presidential candidate Javier Milei, known for his pro-Bitcoin and libertarian economics, earned the top spot in Argentina's primary yesterday.\n\nMilei and his coalition, La Libertad Avanza (\"Liberty Advances\"), raked in over 30% of the votes, beating second-place contender, the center-right coalition, Juntos Por El Cambio (\"Together For Change)\", by slightly less than a 2% margin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUp until Sunday\u2019s shocking results, La Libertad Avanza was considered a reasonably small party that offered minor representation in Congress\u2013despite its successful first foray.\n\nFounded in 2021, during its first legislative elections (which took place the same year) the coalition surprisingly received 17% of the votes In Buenos Aires, becoming the third most-voted coalition in the district.\n\nThose elections earned the coalition two congressional seats, which were occupied by none other than Javier Milei and his now-running mate Victoria Villarruel.\n\nThe candidate\u2014which critics have placed on the far right of the political spectrum\u2014has been lauded by so-called protest voters, and among them cryptocurrency advocates.\n\nAdam Dubove is an Argentine Bitcoin enthusiast who voted for the first time in eight years, \u201cbecause of Milei.\u201d Dubove is a political theorist, who has been on myriad talk shows over the years discussing the country\u2019s political and economic situation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe told Decrypt that it\u2019s not necessarily because of Bitcoin, but rather \u201ca different mindset,\u201d and someone who will \u201cstir up the hen.\u201d\n\nMilei has appeared on multiple talk shows before and during his presidential campaign, preaching the benefits of Bitcoin and crypto.\n\nThe self-proclaimed libertarian economist has called Bitcoin (and some of its competition, like Ethereum) a \u201creturn of money to its original creator: the private sector.\u201d\n\nHe also touted Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply and considers cryptocurrency a safer alternative to transacting in gold or silver.\n\nNot all is rosy in Milei\u2019s connection to cryptocurrency, however.\n\nMilei, Ponzi schemes and the central bank\n\nHe was sued for allegedly promoting a Ponzi scheme in Argentina called Coinx, which is being accused of stealing at least $800,000 in Argentine pesos.\n\nIn a 2022 interview, Milei denied any wrongdoing by the company, which offered high monthly interest rates--to the tune of 8%. According to him, \"Their business model is the same as that of a bank,\" with the only difference being that \"since their interest rate isn't regulated by the central bank, they can pay more.\"\n\nAccording to Manuel Ferrari, a board member of the NGO Bitcoin Argentina, this connection is a concern.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPromoting projects like Coinx makes me not trust him, yet,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nFerrari, a co-founder of Money on Chain, a BTC-backed stablecoin protocol, explained that he doesn\u2019t think Milei is pro-Bitcoin\u2013pointing to a 2019 video of the candidate declaring he \u201cisn\u2019t a specialist in cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThat said, Ferrari told Decrypt that he does think Milei is the \u201cleast likely\u201d of presidential candidates to get things wrong about Bitcoin\u2013and that introducing the freedom to choose currencies \u201cdoes interest him.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s mainly known for is his unabated bashing of the country\u2019s central bank.\n\nLast year he claimed he would \u201cblow it up,\u201d which he has called a scam for cheating \u201cgood people\u201d through inflationary tax.\n\nArgentina currently suffers from rampant inflation, clocking in at 135% this year.\n\nAlthough the country\u2019s Central Bank made anti-crypto moves through a recent ban on digital wallets, not much has changed in the burgeoning crypto scene, which according to Chainalysis, ranks Argentina\u2019s crypto adoption at 13th worldwide.\n\nWhile some in the crypto space are hopeful Milei might push for an El Salvador-style Bitcoin standard, or other similar pro-crypto measures, the eccentric presidential hopeful might not be so willing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast month, for example, he announced his intentions to \u201cdollarize\u201d the Argentine economy."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEurope has beaten the U.S. with the roll-out of the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as London-based Jacobi Asset Management today announced the product's listing on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nAfter receiving approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) in October 2021, the firm initially planned to launch its Bitcoin ETF product last year.\n\nIt, however, decided to postpone the launch, deeming it an inopportune time due to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and the bankruptcy of the FTX crypto exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is finally live, trading under the ticker BCOIN. It charges investors a 1.5% annual management fee.\n\nFidelity Digital Assets handles custodial services for the fund, while Flow Traders takes on the role of market maker. Authorized participants include Jane Street and DRW.\n\n\u201cThis fund has been designed to give institutional investors a simple, secure, and transparent access to Bitcoin whilst addressing their sustainability requirements,\" Jacobi CEO Martin Bednall told Decrypt. \"We believe this ETF launch will be the catalyst for institutional adoption of digital assets.\"\n\nJacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is also billed as the first decarbonized digital asset fund compliant with Article 8 of the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which applies to funds promoting environmental and social objectives.\n\nThe firm partnered with digital asset platform Zumo to implement a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution, which offers institutional investors the ability to deal in Bitcoin while also meeting their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the Jacobi CEO explained to Decrypt, RECs, and offsets are inherently different and should not be confused. Whilst offsets can be used for any aspect of a company\u2019s carbon footprint (one offset represents one tonne of CO2e), RECs relate to electricity consumption only (one REC represents 1 MWh of electricity).\n\nThe REC solution verifies the utilization of renewable energy sources, contributing to the fund's overall decarbonization and adherence to sustainable principles.\n\n\u201cThis makes RECs an ideal tool to use for crypto, where the most material part of the carbon footprint relates to electricity consumption,\" Bednall told Decrypt. \"Furthermore, the use of RECs is recognized under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as a Market-Based accounting method and can be used to claim full decarbonization, whereas the same claim cannot be used for offsets.\u201d\n\nJacobi makes leap from crypto ETNs\n\nThe firm emphasized that as an open-ended fund, its Bitcoin ETF will mark a major shift from the traditional exchange-traded notes (ETNs), to date the most widely spread structure in Europe for crypto-backed financial instruments.\n\nOne key distinction between an ETN and an ETF lies in the ownership structure and the nature of the investment. In the case of an ETF, shareholders possess a stake in the underlying assets held by the fund. ETN investors, on the other hand, own a debt-security.\n\n\u201cETFs are approved by regulators and are overseen by regulated managers. These managers sign off all activities and report on a regular basis to the regulator. ETNs do not have such a party providing this level of investor protection,\u201d Bednall told Decrypt.\n\nETFs are restricted from using leverage or incorporating derivatives, which helps mitigate the potential risks associated with market manipulation. Conversely, ETNs may incorporate leverage or derivatives, thereby introducing an additional layer of risk.\n\nThe launch of Jacobi\u2019s Bitcoin ETF would also mean that European investors will be ahead of their American counterparts in accessing the much sought-after product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGemini, the crypto exchange helmed by the Winklevoss twins, was the first U.S.-based entity to apply for a Bitcoin ETF ten years ago, and American investors are yet to see any of such a product.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has repeatedly rejected or postponed any application it received, citing, among other concerns, market manipulation.\n\nThere's renewed hope that, after years of rejections, a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. will eventually receive regulatory approval.\n\nA new wave of applications recently reached the SEC's door, beginning with Wall Street giant BlackRock's entry into the space last month and followed by more filings submitted by Fidelity, Valkyrie, and Invesco among others."

However, the regulator said in a Friday filing that it will solicit public comment on the ETF proposal, effectively pushing back the deadline.\n\n\u201cMore SEC responses will also be expected during the first week of September, when seven other Bitcoin ETF filings are required to receive a response from the SEC. The possibility is high that several Bitcoin ETFs would be approved in short order, igniting the next leg higher in Bitcoin prices as those ETF providers would spend considerable marketing expenses to draw in retail and institutional capital,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin prices could decline by September to about US$26,000 to US$27,000 as the summer lull ends, Thielen cautioned, adding that this could be an attractive buying opportunity for the seasonal rally in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cBitcoin prices would struggle until September before they start their ascent again. This is happening, and our inclination of being very cautious in managing our positions in the short term but we are eying another perfect buying opportunity to prepare for the year-end rally and the expectations for a strong 2024,\u201d he added.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving event is expected in April 2024, when the amount of new Bitcoin issued is cut in half, increasing its scarcity and pushing up the token\u2019s price.\n\nDogecoin led losers in the past 24 hours, followed by Solana, although both posted gains on the week. Dogecoin lost 1.90% to US$0.07491 in the last 24 hours but gained 0.32% on the week.

        "content": "Grayscale Investments, which has been seeking to convert its Bitcoin (BTC) trust into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, could be getting a decision on its lawsuit against the federal securities regulator before the week\u2019s end.\n\nIn an Aug. 11 tweet, Scott Johnsson, a general partner of Van Buren Capital, explained that law clerks in the United States District Courts generally cycle out in August, pushing judges to clear out the caseload \u201cbefore the new guard arrives.\u201d\n\nHe noted that 30 out of 32 cases in March of 2021 and 2022 were heard by United States District Courts within 160 days of oral testimony, which also landed them in August, adding that it has also been 160 days since Grayscale delivered its oral arguments in its suit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7.\n\nMarch '21/'22 cases with decisions within 160 days of oral: 30/32 (94%)\n\n\n\nDays since Grayscale (March '23) oral: 160 days\n\n\n\nWhy should we expect August? Because law clerks for DC generally cycle in/out this month, so judges aim to clear prior caseload before the new guard arrives. https://t.co/vVj0dHus90 \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) August 14, 2023\n\nAs of now, including Grayscale, there are only a small number of unresolved March-argued cases that remain, Johnsson added.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart says the decision could even come as early as Aug. 15, noting the date has been his \u201ctheoretical Grayscale lawsuit decision date\u201d for some time.\n\n8/15 has been my theoretical Grayscale lawsuit decision date for a while now but it\u2019s really just an educated guess. I didn\u2019t even do detailed analysis on the court decisions like @SGJohnsson did. But I did a little bit of it and also had convos with @NYCStein about timelines \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 14, 2023\n\nJohnsson added in his thread that Seyffart\u2019s prediction is a \u201cpretty decently good bet.\u201d\n\nRelated: An ETF will bring a revolution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\nIn June 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its GBTC to a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn response, Grayscale sued the securities regulator, saying it was acting arbitrarily by failing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles.\n\nA number of industry commentators, including ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood and ETF analyst Nate Geraci, have tipped Grayscale to win the lawsuit.\n\nA lot of noise out there, so here\u2019s my formal prediction on spot bitcoin ETF\u2026\n\n\n\nFirst, I think Grayscale wins lawsuit.\n\n\n\nSecond, combo of Grayscale lawsuit win + COIN SSA is enough for SEC approval IMO.\n\n\n\nIn other words, I think we\u2019re getting a spot bitcoin ETF. Like close to 100%. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 9, 2023\n\nGrayscale recently voiced that the SEC should approve all Bitcoin spot ETF applications simultaneously to prevent firms from having an advantage over other applicants.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019"

        "title": "More Bitcoin ETF Decisions Are Already Looming After SEC Declines to Rule - Wealth Management",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin ETF candidates got another dose of disappointment when US regulators on Friday punted on making a decision on such a product. But the next time they hear from them might be just a few weeks away.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission needs to come to a conclusion on the Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust by Sept. 1, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence tally. Regulators can reject, approve or delay. Decisions for applications from BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree and Invesco are due just a day later, with others following closely behind.\n\nRelated: SEC Delays Decision on ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Filing\n\nCrypto adherents are keeping track of the dates because expectations are running high that this time around \u2014 unlike past attempts \u2014 an exchange-traded fund that invests directly in Bitcoin could receive the regulatory greenlight. In particular, many have glommed onto the fact that BlackRock, the asset-managing powerhouse, has thrown its name into the race \u2014 it has a near-pristine record of getting ETFs launched.\n\nStill, the road to a potential spot fund hasn\u2019t been easy nor quick.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect a delay in those decisions as well,\u201d said James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThe only thing that could possibly change that view is if we get a decision in Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the SEC, and even then, it\u2019s likely we\u2019d see a delay by those deadlines as well.\u201d Grayscale is suing the SEC as it attempts to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nMany in the crypto community \u2014 and fans outside of it \u2014 have been longing for a spot-Bitcoin ETF for years. They argue that it would not only make investing in Bitcoin more accessible to everyday investors, but that it would also help bring the digital-assets space closer into traditional financial markets. On the other hand, regulators have consistently cited fraud and manipulation as some of the reasons not to approve such a product. Gemini, founded by brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, was the first firm to try for a physically backed Bitcoin ETF with a 2013 filing. It was rejected by the SEC.\n\nBut the recent excitement has emboldened issuers to not only try their hand at Bitcoin ETFs but more exotic vehicles as well. A number of companies have submitted paperwork for Ether-futures or Bitcoin-and-Ether-futures-medley funds. Such ETFs don\u2019t currently trade in the US and the SEC had earlier this year rejected attempts for Ether-futures ETFs.\n\nAnother potentially positive signal on the SEC softening its stance toward crypto ETFs might be the launch of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (ticker BITX), according to the Coinbase Bytes newsletter. That fund debuted in June and has amassed more than $20 million in assets. It was the first of its kind to start trading.\n\nRead more:Cathie Wood Says SEC Will Approve Multiple Bitcoin ETFs at OnceWhy Crypto Is Counting on Spot Bitcoin ETFs: QuickTake\n\nThe SEC initially has 45 days within which to come to a determination on the spot-fund applications. That\u2019s followed by another 45 days, then 90 and then 60, for a total of 240. It will have to make a decision within 240 days, Seyffart said.\n\nPlenty of market observers also expect another delay in September.\n\n\u201cThe base case for the ETF application has to be that the administrators will do what they have for years and use all their powers to delay the decision,\u201d said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive of FRNT Financial, an institutional platform focused on digital assets. \u201cEven if these products were ultimately approved, it would be very surprising to see them approved at the first instance they are able to be.\u201d"

        "title": "BTC price breakout by end of August? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is painting a classic August picture as it starts the new week \u2014 volatility is nowhere to be seen.\n\nIn a continuation of some of the quietest BTC price action ever seen, the largest cryptocurrency remains locked in a narrow trading range below $30,000.\n\nWhether it be long or short timeframes, Bitcoin is giving market observers cause for increasing frustration. Despite a tug-of-war between bulls and bears on exchanges, neither party seems able to set a new BTC price trend in motion.\n\nWill the status quo remain this week?\n\nWith few macroeconomic triggers in store, catalysts for change will need to come from elsewhere. Whales are accumulating, data suggests, fueling an argument that Bitcoin is preparing its next major breakout phase in classic style.\n\nA similar conclusion comes from some of the narrowest volatility recorded for Bitcoin courtesy of the Bollinger Bands metric, with current conditions rivalling September 2016 and January 2023.\n\nBy definition, it may simply be a matter of time before history repeats itself.\n\nBitcoin copycat move begins new rangebound week\n\nThe weekly close saw a modicum of volatility return to Bitcoin spot price performance, but just like last week, this was short lived.\n\nFollowing the new weekly candle open, BTC/USD dipped to test $29,000 before returning to its previous position \u2014 one that still holds at the time of writing, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, noted the similarities while repeating his view that $29,700 is the level for bulls to reclaim.\n\nOver the weekend, van de Poppe described the lack of volatility overall as \u201cextremely astonishing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe classic dump on Sunday evening took place on Bitcoin,\u201d he told X subscribers alongside a chart showing relevant areas of interest.\n\n\u201cHolding onto support, all good. Continue the range. Party starts above $29,700.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe/X\n\nPopular trader Daan Crypto Trades held a similar opinion on short-term movements, noting that even weekend conditions were trending toward unusually calm extremes.\n\n\u201cDancing around the CME Close price as expected. It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen anything different,\u201d he summarized.\n\n\u201cVolatility this time around was extremely low. Even for a weekend.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Daan Crypto Trades/X\n\nAn accompanying chart put the CME Bitcoin futures closing price for the week prior at $29,465 as the focal point for the start of the week.\n\nWeekly close clinches key BTC pric level\n\nThe weekly close itself nonetheless did manage to offer a glimmer of hope for those analyzing longer-term trends.\n\nBitcoin, by a hair, managed to close the weekly candle above $29,250 \u2014 a key level highlighted in recent weeks by popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital.\n\nIn an X post just before the event, Rekt Capital referenced previous BTC price behavior after a close at $29,250 or higher.\n\n\u201cBTC upside wicked into the ~$30200 region, much like last week and in April 2023,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cBut if BTC is able to Weekly Close above ~$29250, then that upside wick won\u2019t be as bearish.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Rekt Capital/X\n\nProviding a potential headwind was relative strength index (RSI) data, which on on-week timeframes continued to print a bearish divergence with price.\n\n\u201cWeekly Bearish Divergence for BTC will continue to remain intact unless the RSI is able to break its downtrend (green),\u201d Rekt Capital commented about the phenomenon.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart with RSI. Source: Rekt Capital/X\n\nHistorical data gives few clues as to how BTC/USD might behave before the monthly close.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, August is a mixed bag when it comes to BTC price performance, and so far, Bitcoin has barely moved compared to the end of July.\n\nData from monitoring resource CoinGlass shows that current gains of 0.6% mark Bitcoin\u2019s quietest August month on record.\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns chart (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass\n\nLow volatility spurs BTC price breakout predictions\n\nIt is hard to avoid the topic of volatility \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 when analyzing the current state of Bitcoin.\n\nDespite heavy press coverage, even outside the crypto realm, the near total absence of snap price moves has been the defining characteristic of BTC price action for much of Q2.\n\nThe latest data lays bare just how static the landscape has become \u2014 and what should come afterward.\n\nThe Bitcoin Historical Volatility Index (BVOL) currently measures 9.57 on weekly timeframes, rapidly retracing to all-time lows from the start of this year.\n\nWhat happened when Bitcoin broke out from a downtrend in January is no secret, with its Q1 upside totalling 70%.\n\nBitcoin Historical Volatility Index (BVOL) 1-week chart. Source: TradingView\n\n\u201cThe volatility on Bitcoin is getting lower and lower,\u201d van de Poppe thus stated.\n\n\u201cA matter of 1\u20132 weeks before we\u2019ll be having a big move on the markets.\u201d\n\nSimilar findings come from the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator, now also repeating behavior from the start of 2023.\n\nBollinger Bands narrowing preclude a price breakout, and while it\u2019s unknown whether this would be up or down, the extent of price compression has market participants preparing for dramatic change.\n\n\u201cThe spread between the Upper and Lower Bollinger Bands for Bitcoin is just 2.9% and is as tight as it has ever been,\u201d Checkmate, lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode, wrote in part of an X post on Aug. 14.\n\nCheckmate revealed that Bitcoin had printed tighter Bollinger Bands just twice in its history \u2014 in September 2016 and January 2023.\n\n\u201cWild stuff,\u201d he concluded.\n\nBitcoin Bollinger Bands Range annotated chart. Source: Checkmate/X\n\nWhale \u201creaccumulation\u201d narrative strengthens\n\nPreviously, Cointelegraph reported on interesting shifts among Bitcoin whales underneath stale BTC price action.\n\nThis is continuing, analysis shows, and what looks like accumulation is becoming an ever-larger talking point for those seeking signs of the bull market returning.\n\n\u201cIn the past two weeks, about 10 Bitcoin whales, each holding at least 1,000 BTC (worth a minimum of $29.4 million), have joined the network!\u201d popular trader Ali noted at the weekend.\n\nGlassnode data puts the total number of addresses with a balance of at least 1,000 BTC at 2,015 as of Aug. 13 \u2014 up from 2,005 on Aug. 1.\n\nBitcoin number of addresses with balance over 1,000 BTC chart.
