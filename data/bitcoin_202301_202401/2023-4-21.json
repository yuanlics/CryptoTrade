        "title": "Violation at a Pennsylvania drilling site raises questions about lack of Bitcoin regulation - alleghenyfront.org",
        "content": "This story comes from our partners at WPSU\n\nA gas and oil company mining for cryptocurrency in Elk County, Pennsylvania, was found to be in violation of state regulations when it installed equipment before getting approval from the state Department of Environmental Protection, but the company says it is following the rules.\n\nA March 1 DEP inspection at Diversified Gas and Oil\u2019s Jay Township site found the company had put in place tools for cryptocurrency operations. The company does have a General Permit. But, according to the DEP, Diversified did not have a permit to install the air pollution sources used to generate power for crypto mining. That specific permit is currently under review.\n\nA DEP spokesman said the violation might result in an enforcement action.\n\nThe inspection report notes equipment that was at the Longhorn C pad site, including four natural gas microturbines to make electricity along with two trailers with equipment for cryptocurrency. An engine, generator and oil tank were also there, but were not in operation. The DEP spokesman said the department could not confirm if the cryptocurrency equipment was installed and operating before March 1.\n\nDiversified, headquartered in Alabama, is reportedly the biggest oil and gas well owner in the country. A statement from a company spokesman said Diversified is complying with state rules.\n\n\u201cWe believe operations at the Longhorn C pad are permitted and also operating through exemptions with the Department of Environmental Protection, and that we are in compliance with the requirements,\u201d the statement says.\n\nRead More\n\nEnvironmental groups oppose plan\n\nCrypto mining has been growing in Pennsylvania, raising questions about oversight.\n\nJay Township supervisors had written to DEP earlier this year, saying they were getting complaints about the noise coming from the site. Residents near other crypto mining sites in Pennsylvania have made similar complaints. When reached for comment, a supervisor said the company had addressed the township\u2019s concerns and the site was quieter now.\n\nThree environmental organizations, PennFuture, Clean Air Council and Earthjustice, submitted comments asking the DEP to deny or withdraw approval of Diversified\u2019s plan. Their letter points to the company\u2019s previous violations in Pennsylvania \u2014 operating without valid authorization at 19 locations \u2014 that are listed in a DEP filing.\n\nRob Altenburg, director of the PennFuture Energy Center, said the bitcoin mining industry is not highly regulated.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re seeing a whole lot of violations at a company, it certainly does raise questions: Are they prioritizing public health and environmental protection in their operations,\u201d Altenburg said.\n\nBitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency, currently has a price of about $30,000. Bitcoin mining uses computer systems to solve complex problems, in an effort to do it more quickly than other miners and get rewarded with a coin. But, those supercomputers use a lot of energy.\n\n\u201cAcross the whole Bitcoin network, it uses about as much energy as the state of New York \u2014 more than many entire countries,\u201d Altenburg said.\n\nAltenburg said he and others are trying to raise awareness at the state and federal levels.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this problem here, and it\u2019s bad now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s pollution happening now, but it has the potential to get worse.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin fell 8.48% in the week from April 14 to 21 to trade at US$28,114 at 7:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading below US$30,000 since Wednesday. Ether rose 8.66% over the week to US$1,923.\n\nBitcoin fell below US$29,000 on Thursday for the first time since April 10, leading to the liquidation of over US$266 million worth of long positions in a 24-hour period, according to futures data provider Coinglass.\n\n\u201cThe drop below US$30,000 may have been [caused] by built-up leverage, which resulted in liquidations, but it\u2019s unlikely to last,\u201d John Isige, an analyst at crypto trading platform Vauld told Forkast in a LinkedIn message. \u201cInvestors can look toward US$27,500 ahead of a larger bounce back above the now pivotal US$30,000.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.19 trillion on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 7% from US$1.28 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$544 billion market cap accounted for 45.73% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$231 billion accounted for 19.4%.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler addressed the House Financial Services Committee during a congressional oversight hearing on Tuesday, where he repeatedly evaded the opportunity to clarify whether Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, should be labeled as a security.\n\nThe European Parliament voted in favor of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) on Thursday, a framework to standardize regulations for crypto assets across the world\u2019s third-largest economy. It is now pending approval from the European Council.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin, other cryptos fall as investors book profit\n\nBiggest gainers: OKX & CSPR\n\nThe OKX crypto exchange\u2019s utility token (OKB) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap, rising 10.92% to US$52.82. The token started picking up on Monday, after OKX announced that it would add layer-1 blockchain Sui\u2019s token (SUI) to their jumpstart program. This will allow investors to trade OKB for SUI at a discount.\n\nProof-of-stake blockchain Casper Network\u2019s CSPR coin was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer, with an 8.06% price increase to trade at US$0.04919. The coin started its rally last Saturday, days after announcing the launch of the Casper Wallet on April 11.\n\nNext week: Bitcoin\u2019s US$27,500 resistance\n\nAccording to a March 31 court filing, the U.S. government seized 51,351.89 Bitcoin (worth US$1.4 billion) from Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the darknet marketplace Silk Road. The government sold 9,861 Bitcoin (US$279 million) on March 14 and is planning to sell the remaining 41,490 Bitcoin (US$1.1 billion) in four batches this year.\n\nBitcoin values will decline further in the short term as \u201cthe U.S. plans to sell its remaining 41,490 Bitcoin, which I\u2019m expecting to happen soon,\u201d said Kasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital. \u201cBitcoin is up 70%+ year to date. It\u2019s only expected that investors are taking profits or derisk,\u201d he added.\n\nVauld analyst Isige said that US$27,500 will be a key price level next week.\n\n\u201cBitcoin needs a weekly close above US$27,500 or the 50-day EMA on the daily timeframe to weaken its downside potential and confirm an upward trend. Primary support traders will be looking at US$24,000, although US$27,500 is a price level we must watch keenly. Its upside is primarily capped by the seller congestion at US$30,000,\u201d wrote Isige.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns over interest rate hikes in the world\u2019s largest economy have reignited as Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said it is too early to consider pausing interest rate hikes. The U.S. inflation rate dropped to 5% in March, above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\n\u201cConsidering they called inflation \u2018transitory,\u2019 it is reasonable to assume we will get a potentially long and hard recession that affects risk assets, such as Bitcoin. The stock market additionally seems to be setting up for a difficult second half of 2023, which would likely drag Bitcoin and crypto, as well. [As low as] US$9,000 remains in play,\u201d wrote Santos.\n\n\u201cThe price will need to hold above US$30,500 for 5-7 weekdays to confirm the low. Until then, moves to the upside are nothing more than bear market rallies,\u201d he added.\n\nSee related article: Crypto firms hardpressed to find U.S. bank partners as industry blames \u2018Operation Choke Point 2.0\u2019"

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Gold: Which One Is a Better Investment? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Over the past decade, Bitcoin (BTC -0.22%) has catapulted into the spotlight as the premier cryptocurrency. Along the way, multiple narratives have arisen to justify an investment in Bitcoin. One of those is that it is like \"digital gold\" because, like gold, it can act as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.\n\nSo if Bitcoin is basically digital gold, which is the better investment?\n\nThe tale of the tape\n\nTo start, let's talk about the concept of a store of value. A store of value is an asset that preserves wealth and acts as a counter to economic declines and inflation, with the expectation that it will also appreciate over time. Gold has long been considered to meet this criterion.\n\nWhen we compare the price of both since Bitcoin was created in 2009, it becomes clear that while gold does a fair job at preserving wealth, it comes nowhere near the combination Bitcoin provides of preserving and growing wealth.\n\nWhat the numbers say\n\nSince 2009, the inflation-adjusted return of gold annually has been about 3.3%, and the total return has been about 57%. In the same period, Bitcoin has an inflation-adjusted annualized return of nearly 145% and a total return of 33,983,965%.\n\nNow, clearly there is a flaw in this comparison because gold has been in existence for millennia and Bitcoin has only been around for 14 years. So let's take it back further.\n\nSince 1980, gold's performance has proven lackluster, generating an annualized return of 3.1% before inflation. After we account for 40 years of inflation, gold produced an unappetizing annualized return of -0.24% and a total return of -10.1%.\n\nFrom this angle, it becomes clear that not only does Bitcoin outpace gold in terms of preserving wealth as a store of value and as a hedge against inflation, it also does an excellent job of growing wealth.\n\nWhy Bitcoin?\n\nBut to truly understand how Bitcoin has risen to this level, it helps to understand how it improves upon some of the primary characteristics that originally made gold attractive to investors.\n\nBitcoin and gold both exist in finite amounts. But Bitcoin takes this a step further. While gold is finite in the sense that it is a physical resource that needs to be mined, its supply is not fixed and can fluctuate based on mining activity and new discoveries. However, Bitcoin's supply is fixed at 21 million coins, and new coins will gradually enter circulation at a diminishing rate until the year 2140, when the last Bitcoin will be mined.\n\nAnother advantage of Bitcoin over gold is its portability and ease of transfer. Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes, without the need for intermediaries such as banks or payment processors. All one needs is an internet connection.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin has a high degree of divisibility, with each coin divisible into 100 million satoshis. This makes it easier to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange for small transactions, something that isn't as feasible with gold. While Bitcoin as form of currency hasn't quite materialized like some might hope, there is progress being made thanks to growing adoption of payment solutions like the Lightning Network.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning the technological advancements that Bitcoin represents. Bitcoin is built on blockchain technology, a decentralized digital ledger that is immutable and transparent. This means that every transaction that takes place on the Bitcoin network is verified and recorded on the blockchain, making it virtually impossible for anyone to alter or manipulate the data. This level of transparency and security is unprecedented in the world of finance and represents a significant leap forward.\n\nConsider these additional characteristics and the simple fact that Bitcoin has recently dominated gold in terms of its performances as a store of value and inflation hedge, and it becomes clear that an investment in Bitcoin today could prove valuable. In a world that is becoming increasingly digital and as the need for alternatives to inflation-prone fiat currencies persists, Bitcoin is in a unique position to benefit for decades to come as increased demand runs up against its finite supply."

        "title": "The game theory of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies make them an interesting subject for game theory analysis, as they can help explain the incentives and behaviors involved in trading and investing. This article discusses the concept of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, mining cryptocurrencies and blockchain forks that are relevant to the game theory of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIntroduction to game theory and cryptocurrencies\n\nGame theory is a mathematical framework that helps explain decision-making in strategic situations. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC), have become a popular subject for game theorists due to their decentralized nature and potential to disrupt traditional financial systems.\n\nThe prisoner\u2019s dilemma and cryptocurrency mining\n\nIn the classic game theory scenario known as the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, two parties must make a choice without knowing what the other will do. In the context of cryptocurrency mining, the prisoner\u2019s dilemma can help explain why miners may act in their own self-interest, even if it is not in the best interest of the network as a whole.\n\nThe first miner to successfully solve a challenging mathematical equation receives fresh BTC units. Both computer power and energy usage are essential requirements for the mining operation. The tragedy of the commons, which happens when individuals prioritize their own interests over the needs of the whole, is one of the biggest obstacles in cryptocurrency mining. By mining cryptocurrencies, miners may put their individual financial gain ahead of the network\u2019s overall security and stability.\n\nA helpful foundation for comprehending this behavior is provided by the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. In the scenario, two people are arrested for a crime, and they are offered the option to work together or turn on one another. If they both cooperate, their sentences are both lowered. When one betrays the other, the betrayer is given a lighter punishment, while the other is given a lengthier one. Both receive a moderate penalty if they betray one another.\n\nRelated: How does blockchain solve the Byzantine generals problem?\n\nMiners confront a similar decision-making process while mining cryptocurrencies. The network is safe and secure if all miners collaborate by mining honestly and making a contribution. Yet one miner may benefit more from mining maliciously or not contributing to the network if they choose to behave in their own self-interest.\n\nLet's look at the below diagram illustrating an example of two miners in a cryptocurrency pool to understand how the prisoner's dilemma can be applied to the context of cryptocurrency mining.\n\nIn the above diagram, Miner A and Miner B are two miners in a cryptocurrency mining pool. They have the choice to cooperate (continue mining together) or defect (leave the pool and mine independently). The rewards and payoffs are based on the classic prisoner's dilemma scenario:\n\nIf both miners cooperate, they both receive a reward (e.g. a share of the mining profits).\n\nIf Miner A defects while Miner B cooperates, Miner A receives a temptation payoff (e.g. a larger share of the mining profits), while Miner B receives a suckers payoff (e.g. a smaller share of the mining profits).\n\nIf Miner A cooperates while Miner B defects, Miner A receives a suckers payoff, while Miner B receives a temptation payoff.\n\nIf both miners defect, they both receive a punishment (e.g. lower overall mining profits).\n\nThis diagram illustrates how the prisoner's dilemma can be applied to the context of cryptocurrency mining. It shows the potential rewards and payoffs for each combination of cooperation and defection, and can help miners make decisions about whether to stay in a pool or mine independently.\n\nThe defector will receive a larger share of the profits because they are not sharing their earnings with the other miner. On the other hand, the cooperator who remained in the pool will receive a smaller share of the rewards because they are now contributing more computing power but still receiving the same share of the rewards as before.\n\nTo address this challenge, cryptocurrency networks can implement various incentives and mechanisms to encourage miners to act in the interest of the network as a whole. For example, networks can reward miners who contribute to the network with lower fees or increased mining rewards. Additionally, networks can implement penalties or defensive mechanisms to discourage malicious behavior.\n\nThe game theory of blockchain forks\n\nBlockchain forks are another scenario where game theory can help explain the decision-making process of participants. A fork occurs when a blockchain network splits into two separate paths, often due to disagreements among participants about the direction of the network.\n\nA fork can be thought of as a coordination game from the perspective of game theory. Two or more players must work together to attain a common objective in a coordination game. Participants in a blockchain fork must work together to decide which fork to promote and which to reject.\n\nThe Bitcoin network split into two distinct forks in 2017: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This is one of the most well-known instances of a blockchain fork. Disagreements within the Bitcoin community on how to expand the network to handle an increasing volume of transactions led to the creation of this fork.\n\nIn this case, members of the Bitcoin community had to choose between sticking with the old Bitcoin network and switching to the new Bitcoin Cash network. The choice was not easy because each fork has pros and cons of its own. For instance, while Bitcoin Cash offered quicker transaction times and lower fees, Bitcoin had a larger network and higher acceptance.\n\nParticipants in this scenario had to take into account their personal preferences and opinions regarding the potential future worth of each network in the context of game theory. Participants would be motivated to promote Bitcoin Cash even if it meant leaving the original Bitcoin network if they thought it had a stronger chance of long-term growth.\n\nRelated: How to buy Bitcoin Cash: A beginner\u2019s guide for buying BCH\n\nLet's look at the below diagram, illustrating two miners facing the choice of whether to adopt a new fork in the blockchain or continue on the old fork to understand how game theory can be applied to the context of blockchain forks.\n\nThe above diagram depicts the strategic decision-making of two miners, Miner A and Miner B, on a blockchain, as they face the choice of either adopting a new fork or continuing on the old fork. The rewards and penalties are based on the following assumptions:\n\nIf both miners adopt the new fork, they both receive a reward (e.g. increased mining efficiency).\n\nIf Miner A adopts the new fork while Miner B continues on the old fork, Miner A receives a penalty (e.g. decreased mining efficiency), while Miner B receives a reward.\n\nIf Miner A continues on the old fork while Miner B adopts the new fork, Miner A receives a reward, while Miner B receives a penalty.\n\nIf both miners continue on the old fork, they both receive a temptation payoff (e.g. maintaining control over the blockchain).\n\nThis diagram illustrates how game theory can be applied to the context of blockchain forks. It shows the potential rewards and penalties for each combination of adopting or not adopting a new fork, and can help miners make decisions about whether to switch to a new fork or stick with the current one.\n\nTo address this challenge, cryptocurrency networks can implement various mechanisms to ensure that forks occur as smoothly as possible. For example, networks can implement replay protection, which prevents transactions on one network from being replayed on the other."

        "content": "Babylon, a crypto security blockchain using Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work security to integrate with proof-of-stake chains, plans to expand beyond the Cosmos.\n\nDesigned by David Tse and his team at Stanford\u2019s Blockchain Consensus Protocol Lab, Babylon was created using the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK). It communicates with Bitcoin through a Bitcoin timestamping protocol.\n\nThis means that it interacts with the Bitcoin chain by sending events on Babylon onto the Bitcoin chain, Tse told Blockworks in an interview.\n\nIn Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original Bitcoin white paper, the author noted how they wanted to build Bitcoin to become a timestamping server, Tse said.\n\n\u201cIn his case, he was interested in timestamping Bitcoin transactions,\u201d Tse said. \u201cIt turns out that you can also put arbitrary data onto the Bitcoin chain, so this allows you to timestamp not only Bitcoin transactions but also events happening outside of the Bitcoin chain.\u201d\n\nUsing this knowledge, Babylon is able to timestamp events occurring on different proof-of-stake chains.\n\nRead more: The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Consensus Mechanisms\n\nWait, so how does it make the blockchain more secure?\n\nExisting proof-of-stake chains such as Osmosis already have a handful of validators signing off on transactions.\n\nWhat Babylon does through Bitcoin timestamps is bring in a second-level committee to certify the transaction.\n\n\u201cFor smaller transactions of $1,000 or a few hundred, the proof-of-stake committee is enough \u2014 they\u2019re fast to validate and approve transactions, but if you have a transaction that has very high value or transactions that actually affect the security of the proof-of-stake chain, that will deserve an extra level of protection from Bitcoin,\u201d Tse said.\n\nAn example Tse notes would be unbinding transactions, where the transaction itself will affect the security of the validators. \u201cBitcoin is slower, but it has a much higher level of security,\u201d he said\n\nBabylon is currently integrated with 16 different app chains on their testnets that have a value of $1.4 billion. These 16 different app chains are secured using Bitcoin\u2019s $600 billion.\n\nBeyond the Cosmos\n\nBabylon currently exists as a testnet and plans to launch its mainnet in Q3 or A4, Tse said.\n\nThe Cosmos ecosystem has been its focus for a handful of reasons \u2014 notably its powerful interoperability capabilities through its inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) which enables automatic time stamping from all these chains to Babylon, but also due to its diverse app chain ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThis gives us very broad exposure to different kinds of applications\u2026We learn quite a bit working with them and understanding how they want to use Bitcoin security,\u201d Tse said.\n\nAlthough this is the case, Babylon is also looking at ways it can expand beyond the Cosmos. This is currently being explored in two different directions, one of which is implementing smart contracts on Babylon that create timestamping.\n\n\u201cThis allows us to go outside the Cosmos ecosystem\u2026it doesn\u2019t even have to be chains, it could be specific applications that are running on Ethereum that want additional security,\u201d Tse said. \u201cBitcoin is very powerful, very secure, but it has a very big limitation\u2026which is it doesn\u2019t have smart contracts, so Babylon deals with the difficult work of interacting with the not-so-smart chain Bitcoin and enables it to interact with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nThe second direction, Tse notes, is to integrate with interoperable chains \u2014 such as Axelar.\n\n\u201cAxelar is interoperable with many chains outside the Cosmos, then we can get timestamps for all these chains Axelar is integrated with as well,\u201d he said.\n\nUsing Bitcoin security to build dapp projects\n\nInstead of competing directly with Ethereum, Tse believes it is possible to bring existing proof-of-stake chains to an even more secure Bitcoin through interoperability.\n\n\u201cEthereum has been very successful in building an ecosystem that incorporates brilliant new technology,\u201d Tse said. \u201cSo what we\u2019re saying here is that Bitcoin is an arguably even more secure chain and it has a 14-year history.\u201d\n\nBabylon is not the only project that Tse and his team are working on.\n\nUsing ordinal technology, Tse and his team are currently looking into ways to use Bitcoin block space to eliminate censorship of transactions on proof-of-stake chains.\n\n\u201cYou could put these transactions onto the Bitcoin block space and because Bitcoin has [a] very strong censorship resistance property, that would allow that transaction to survive the censorship\u2026 that is another type of protocol that is on our roadmap,\u201d Tse said.\n\nRead more: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: Which Is Better?\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining heat is energy gold. Let's make use of it - Forkast News",
        "content": "Despite concerns over Bitcoin mining\u2019s energy consumption, Bitcoin mining has the potential to be a net positive for humanity\u2019s relationship with energy and sustainability. This can be achieved by the mining industry using intermittent, stranded and waste power sources and subsidizing sustainable energy. A less-explored opportunity is to collect and redirect the excess heat generated by Bitcoin mining for other heating needs. This Earth Day, let us consider how Bitcoin mining can not only help our planet and improve humanity\u2019s relationship with energy by serving as a buyer of zero-carbon energy, but it can also serve as a producer of recyclable and reusable energy.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s energy recycling potential\n\nMany of Bitcoin\u2019s critics are understandably worried about Bitcoin\u2019s rising energy consumption. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s electricity consumption has only ever gone up since the digital asset\u2019s inception. Similarly, Bitcoin\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 although there have been ups and downs \u2014 have also grown over time.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is not the whole story.\n\nBitcoin mining produces a lot of heat, and harnessing and redirecting that excess heat is not just a theoretical possibility. In fact, there are already plans for a Canadian city to be heated by Bitcoin miners. An energy provider, Lonsdale Energy Corporation, and MintGreen, a Bitcoin mining company, are partnering up to provide at least some of the heat demanded by the residents of North Vancouver.\n\nMintGreen will recycle about 20,000 tons of toxic gas per megawatt that would have otherwise entered the atmosphere and contributed to global warming. Instead, this liability of toxic emissions will be turned into an asset: Over 95% of the energy that the miners initially consume will be converted into thermal energy that will be used to heat several buildings. Since Bitcoin miners can run continuously, and because there will almost certainly always be a supply of Bitcoin miners available, the city will be able to rely on their excess heat during any month of any year.\n\nThis endeavor is not a pie-in-the-sky dream. MintGreen had already made deals with the Vancouver Island Sea Salt facility and Shelter Point Distillery to sell them heat during frigid Canadian winters.\n\nBitcoin mining\u2019s versatility also allows its excess heat to be used for recreational ends. For example, it costs between US$2,000 and US$5,000 to heat a typical swimming pool. Bitcoin mining can turn this money sink and associated energy consumption into a zero-cost endeavor. All you have to do is connect your Bitcoin mining machine to your pool\u2019s water pump. You simultaneously earn the hardest asset ever created and heat your pool at no additional charge.\n\nWhile heating a swimming pool is an amusing application, Bitcoin miners\u2019 excess heat has more profound use cases for humanity. Companies are already collaborating with researchers to create greenhouses that are heated by Bitcoin mining.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the heat from Bitcoin mining is warming a greenhouse for tulips and cutting the flower farmers\u2019 reliance on gas, which has become more expensive since Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. In Sweden, another mining company\u2019s 600-kilowatt ASIC machines\u2019 heat is directed toward warming a 300-square-meter greenhouse in which fruit and vegetables are grown. The miners are embedded in a data center container, which is fitted with an air duct apparatus that draws heat from the ASICs and sends it to the greenhouse. In theory, this would keep the greenhouse at 77 degrees Fahrenheit continuously. Considering that the temperature of the area drops to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit in wintertime, the potential savings on heat costs and use are significant.\n\nJust as Bitcoin mining can make good use of intermittent, stranded and waste energy sources, recycling and reusing miners\u2019 waste heat can potentially increase the profitability and sustainability of indoor farming and food production. As one researcher said, \u201cA 1 [megawatt] data center would have the ability to strengthen the local self-sufficiency up to 8% with products that are competitive on the market.\u201d\n\nSimmering tensions\n\nNot everyone is excited about Bitcoin miners\u2019 heat, especially those who suffer from its unintended consequences. For example, residents near Seneca Lake in upstate New York have complained that a nearby power plant\u2019s collaboration with over 8,000 miners has caused their lake to \u201cfeel like you\u2019re in a hot tub.\u201d\n\nThe power plant takes in 139 million gallons of water from the lake and gives back 135 million gallons every day. The water that is recycled back into the lake gets up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. To be sure, solutions can in principle be found, but we must nevertheless admit that sometimes miners\u2019 heat can affect a community\u2019s environment in ways that people do not enjoy.\n\nSustainable energy sources still matter\n\nAside from Bitcoin mining helping subsidize renewable energy, our ability to harness and direct its excess heat is yet another way that Bitcoin can help combat climate change. Less than a decade ago, Imperial College London estimated that heating residential and commercial buildings accounted for almost half of all energy consumption and 40% of all energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. If all of this heat could be provided by carbon-neutral sources, it could be the most revolutionary impact on climate change in a generation.\n\nOn the face of it, replacing carbon-emitting heat sources with the excess heat of Bitcoin miners may not make enough of a difference. After all, if Bitcoin miners are themselves fueled by carbon-intensive fuel sources, then heating one\u2019s home with miners\u2019 excess heat does not necessarily reduce enough emissions for us to meet our climate goals.\n\nBut Bitcoin miners are unique in their ability to render viable renewable energy sources that would have not been profitable in the miners\u2019 absence. Heating commercial and residential buildings with miners\u2019 excess heat really could help put a dent in humanity\u2019s carbon emissions \u2014 provided that the miners themselves are powered by, say, solar energy.\n\nWe have already seen that heating buildings and powering indoor farms with Bitcoin miners\u2019 excess heat is not a pipe dream but a reality. It may not be a big leap to imagine what a difference it could make on our planet if Bitcoin miners could themselves be fueled entirely by carbon-neutral sources."

        "title": "3 Top Cryptos That Could Soar Higher Than Bitcoin - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the crypto market, all eyes are on Bitcoin (BTC -0.07%), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. At one point, Bitcoin was up more than 80% for the year, as it soared to a price of $30,000. However, Bitcoin has started to pull back in recent days and is now up only 3% over the past 30 days.\n\nAt the same time, a number of cryptos are keeping pace with Bitcoin's overall performance. For example, Ethereum (ETH -0.89%) is up more than 63% for the year and 10% over the past 30 days. And both Avalanche (AVAX 2.69%) and Cardano (ADA -1.75%) are up more than 64% for the year. Here's a closer look at why these three cryptos could be ready to soar higher than Bitcoin.\n\nThe Layer 1 blockchain thesis\n\nAll three of these cryptos are premier Layer 1 blockchains. You can think of these blockchains as the \"building blocks\" of the crypto industry. Once you have a Layer 1 blockchain like Ethereum, you can start to build on top of it. That means enjoying things like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, and web3 decentralized applications.\n\nImportantly, these are all innovations the Bitcoin blockchain was not designed to offer. Bitcoin is, first and foremost, a potential store of value, similar to gold. Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, also designed it to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. But beyond that, Bitcoin does not offer nearly the functionality and diversification that you find with the big Layer 1 blockchain networks. If you want to get involved in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), for example, you go to a blockchain like Ethereum.\n\nAs a result, one powerful investment thesis right now involves Layer 1 blockchains. All three of these Layer 1 blockchains -- Ethereum, Cardano, and Avalanche -- are highly diversified, and all of them rank as Top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. In terms of market cap, Ethereum trails only Bitcoin. Cardano, which launched back in 2017, now ranks as the No. 7 crypto in terms of market cap.\n\nOf these three, Avalanche (No. 15 in terms of market cap) may be the least-known among casual investors. However, during the last crypto bull market rally, Avalanche was routinely discussed as a potential \"Ethereum killer\" and comes with a solid pedigree. And in January 2023, Avalanche signed an important partnership deal with Amazon Web Services to offer blockchain services to large corporate and government clients.\n\nThe flight to quality\n\nHowever, not all Layer 1 blockchains are seeing the same type of performance as Ethereum, Cardano, and Avalanche. For example, if you look at the next tier of smaller Layer 1 blockchains, many of them are actually struggling right now. For example, Aptos (CRYPTO: APT) is down 9% over the past 30 days, and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO) is down 11%.\n\nThe big factor here appears to be an overall flight to quality by investors. While sentiment has turned markedly bullish for crypto in 2023, there is still a realization that we're not out of the woods yet. Case in point: Bitcoin seemed to be unstoppable for the first three months of the year but now is struggling to soar past $30,000.\n\nAs a result, investors are still searching out high-quality names. This generally means a focus on cryptos with huge market caps and the biggest blockchain ecosystems. This explains why some Layer 1 blockchains are doing so well while others are not.\n\nWhich Layer 1 blockchain is the best investment?\n\nIn choosing between top Layer 1 blockchains, the obvious choice would be Ethereum. This crypto, just like Bitcoin, is a favorite of institutional investors. It has a huge market cap, a well-diversified ecosystem, and a huge developer base. Ethereum also ranks No. 1 in terms of NFT trading volume and No. 1 in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), which is a key metric for determining how much activity is actually taking place on a blockchain. Moreover, in late 2022, Ethereum completed a highly successful technological transformation -- known as The Merge -- that sets the stage for strong long-term growth.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a dark horse candidate that might end up outperforming Ethereum over the long run, it's Cardano. This crypto, which has never traded higher than $3.10, is en fuego this year. It's up 64% for the year, which is keeping pace with both Ethereum and Bitcoin. And it has a new strategy based around DeFi that is going gangbusters. The latest first-quarter 2023 metrics for Cardano are now in, and all signals are flashing green.\n\nNow is the time to invest in high-quality Layer 1 blockchains that have diverse blockchain ecosystems and solid long-term growth prospects. The three names on my list right now are Ethereum, Cardano, and Avalanche."

        "content": "Fresh data from Glassnode demonstrates that Bitcoin's (BTC) Lightning Network is significantly cheaper to use than legacy payment networks.\n\nThe median fee rate, or the cost of sending value across the Lightning Network, is 0.0029%, 1,000 times cheaper than that of Mastercard or Visa payment processors.\n\nJames Check, the lead analyst at Glassnode, told Cointelegraph that the median fee rate, or the fee charged per 1 BTC sent across the Lightning Network, is currently 3,000 satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin). That is \u201cequivalent to $0.84 to send $28,800 worth of value [...,] which is a fee of 0.0029%.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty remarkable when you think about it.\u201d\n\nIn a post on the Nostr social media protocol, Bitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair noted that this rate is many times less than that charged by major credit card companies.\n\nThe Lightning Network, a layer-2 payments solution built atop the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, was first proposed as a way to make Bitcoin effective as a payment method. These data points demonstrate that it is not only fast but low-cost, with the mean fee rate steadily trending lower since November 2021.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nLegacy payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard charge merchants a fee of around 2-3% per transaction, making them an expensive option for businesses. In an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary shot in Cape Verde, the business owner of one of the few businesses to accept Bitcoin explained that accepting foreign Visa and Mastercard costs over 8%.\n\nMoreover, Glassnode\u2019s Check referred to users who run their own nodes and manage their own channels. Many Lightning users take advantage of custodial wallets, such as the Wallet of Satoshi and Alby, to make micropayments on social media apps such as Nostr.\n\nSome Bitcoin early adopters have noted the growing preference for custodial solutions (the Bitcoiner mantra is \u201cnot your keys, not your coin\u201d), although semi-custodial solutions such as Fedi and Cashu could undermine reliance on fully custodial solutions.\n\nRelated: MicroStrategy\u2019s Saylor fuses work email address with Bitcoin Lightning\n\nFurthermore, the throughput of the Lightning Network could be called into question. Check explained:\n\n\u201cOf course, we must also consider that the typical channel is smaller than 1 BTC. The median channel size is 0.02 BTC and the mean is 0.08 BTC, so overall the Lightning Network remains well suited to payments below $1,000.\u201d\n\nIn the below graph, the channel size is trending higher but still well under $10,000. In such an environment, payments over $1,000 may be better suited to the Bitcoin base chain in order to avoid payment failure or misfire.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "To say that Bitcoin (BTC -0.07%) has been on a tear in 2023 would be an understatement: The world's leading cryptocurrency is up more than 70% so far this year as of April 20. This gain not only easily outpaces the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, but it is also a greater rise than Ethereum, another popular digital asset.\n\nAfter eclipsing the $30,000 mark, investors might be thinking of a much larger target to set their eyes on. Can Bitcoin reach $100,000? While it might not happen this year, there is a very real possibility that it will occur in the next five. Here's why.\n\nAll eyes on the Fed\n\nJust around the time when the Federal Reserve indicated that inflation might not be so transitory after all, Bitcoin peaked at nearly $69,000, in November 2021. Throughout 2022, when the central bank hiked interest rates at the fastest pace in history, the digital currency got crushed, losing 65%, a much bigger loss than the stock market and about in line with the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nInvestors can glean one very important insight from this type of price action. For now, it's evident that Bitcoin trades more like a growth tech stock, influenced by macroeconomic news like recent inflation data or the Fed's actions. At the start of this year, risk assets have generally performed well, a possible sign that investors think rate hikes are coming to an end soon.\n\nAnd Bitcoin is up significantly since the start of the regional-bank fiasco more than a month ago. Perhaps investors also view this top digital asset as a safe and reliable holding amid the turmoil. While these catalysts can drive greater demand for Bitcoin, I don't think they are enough to push the price to $100,000, especially not in 2023.\n\nBitcoin as a store of value\n\nThese catalysts do, however, bring more attention to Bitcoin, which should benefit over the long term as more dollars flow in as well, despite the inevitable ups and downs. I think Bitcoin's most compelling use centers on it becoming a more widely adopted store of value, something that individual and institutional investors will propel. And the growing number of businesses that provide easy access to buying Bitcoin will make it more accessible to the masses.\n\nBut this raises the question: What fundamental reason is there that would make investors want to buy and hold Bitcoin over extended periods of time? Bulls point to one thing and one thing only, and that is the fact that there will only ever be 21 million coins in circulation, an absolutely finite cap that should support a higher price many years from now. And in about a year, Bitcoin's block reward for processing transactions will be cut in half, usually a positive indicator for its price trajectory.\n\nWhat's more relatable is Bitcoin's superiority when inflation is still soaring and governments all over the world -- including the U.S. -- have debased their currencies throughout history. More dollars chasing fewer bitcoins bodes well for the latter's future price. And although Bitcoin won't move in lockstep with the consumer price index, its total return of nearly 48,000,000% (since July 2010, based on the earliest data provided by coinmarketcap.com) certainly proves that it not only preserves purchasing power, but also raises it.\n\nAccording to consulting firm McKinsey & Co., the total global net worth was more than $600 trillion at the end of 2021. This means that Bitcoin's current market cap of $590 billion accounts for less than 0.1% of this astronomical value, even after its huge run-up this year. This means there is still a very long runway for the crypto to find itself in more portfolios.\n\nTo be fair, to get from Bitcoin's current price to $100,000 in five years, there needs to be regulatory clarity, especially in the U.S., allowing the country to lead development of the global framework for this asset class.\n\nEven more important, people just need to learn more about Bitcoin's value proposition in the broader financial landscape. Once this happens, it's hard not to be bullish."

The value of Bitcoin is down 7.6% in the past week as of noon ET on Friday, and that leads to a lot of lost value for miners and related companies.\n\nAccording to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, shares of Canaan (CAN -1.44%) have fallen 15.7% since Friday's close, HIVE Blockchain (HIVE -0.32%) is down 17%, Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%) has dropped 17.6%, Hut 8 Mining (HUT) is down 16.9%, and Cipher Mining (CIFR 7.81%) has fallen 22.7%. But will the drop continue?\n\nSo what\n\nYou can see in the chart below how these companies follow the price of Bitcoin, at least over the short term. And with good reason.\n\nWhether you're mining Bitcoin or creating chips or other products for miners, the price of Bitcoin itself is very important. It's the equivalent to the price of a commodity for miners in the commodity industry. If the price falls, so does revenue.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, miners often hold Bitcoin they mine on the balance sheet. This puts additional leverage on these companies, making the volatility worse both when Bitcoin goes up and when it goes down.\n\nThe reliance on high Bitcoin prices is evident when you start looking at net income for each of these companies.\n\nThey need Bitcoin to remain elevated to make money. If the bounce above $30,000 doesn't hold, they might continue losing money.\n\nNow what\n\nWhat's not clear at this point is whether the Bitcoin rally will continue. There's been renewed interest in blockchain assets after the U.S. began cracking down on some companies in the wake of SVB's failure, but both could actually lead to the U.S. crypto industry being even smaller.\n\nInternationally, the news is better, with countries like the U.K. and Hong Kong creating rules that make crypto easier to own. It's possible that the U.S. will follow a similar path eventually, given Congressional pressure, but that has yet to happen.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for these miners is that competition is much stronger than it has been in previous crypto cycles. Some other blockchains are faster, cheaper, and less energy intensive, reducing the market opportunity for Bitcoin.\n\nCombine that with miners' reliance on the price of Bitcoin itself, and this is a tough business in which to generate long-term value. Most Bitcoin mining companies are just leveraged plays on Bitcoin, and investors who are looking for exposure to Bitcoin can just buy the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nI have not been bullish on Bitcoin miners for a long time, and this week's move is a good example of why. They carry more risk than Bitcoin and often just exaggerate the cryptocurrency's moves."

        "title": "Bitcoin Options Specialist Bitnomial Rolling out Block Trades - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin-focused derivatives exchange Bitnomial is rolling out block trading for the first time in an industry bid to capitalize on a long time traditional finance practice, as US institutional interest in bitcoin and ether options has booked a marked uptick.\n\nOpen interest in the US and in other countries plummeted in the fourth quarter of 2022 as digital asset markets collapsed. But in the first quarter of this year, open interest, a metric that reflects the number of outstanding contracts on a given unsettled options contract, has recovered.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was down about 7% in the last seven days through the stock market close in New York on Thursday.\n\nIn terms of bitcoin options on Deribit, \u201crecovered\u201d is an understatement \u2014 they hit an all-time high last month, as previously reported by Blockworks. Volume on Deribit, long one of the world\u2019s largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency option exchanges, exceeded $20 billion at the time, the company said.\n\nOptions on digital assets in the US are limited to bitcoin and ether (ETH) by regulators.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Blockworks on Thursday, Bitnomial President Michael Dunn said the exchange is rolling out block trading this week because \u201cnow\u2019s a good time as we see a lot of crypto-native firms coming in\u201d to the bitcoin options trading space with dry powder to splurge.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve been asking, according to Dunn, for customized baskets of bitcoin option books specifically. Crypto hedge fund managers, family offices and other types of traders typically shop around for market makers on digital asset options, often tapping a number of counterparties to try to lock in the best possible price, coupled with the best possible execution.\n\nBlock trading is an over the counter (OTC) arrangement that results in an agreement between a market maker and a buy side counterparty to take on a specified number of derivatives at a specified cost of carry.\n\nIt\u2019s more time consuming than executing an algorithmic trade on BTC options tied to underlying bitcoins. But traders find the practice worthwhile if they\u2019re buying in enough bulk that they snap up futures contracts at a discount to where the market is pricing the cost of opening and closing them.\n\n\u201cCrypto native [traders], they came knocking on our door saying, \u2018Hey, you guys have a lit order book and electronic execution, that\u2019s great. But we\u2019re looking to do more complex, structured trades that actually make sense to do atomically and in bigger size and kind of poke around and do block deals.\u201d\n\nBelow are some additional excerpts from Blockworks\u2019 interview with Dunn, who formerly worked in the Chicago options trading scene and has experience with quantitative market making of options on traditional option classes as a result.\n\nBlockworks: Given your and the exchange\u2019s background on the algorithmic side of things, what\u2019s your take on trends you\u2019ve been noticing from a technical perspective? What\u2019s been interesting to you generally, institutional or retail moves from a trading perspective?\n\nMichael Dunn; Source: Bitnomial\n\nDunn: There is something kind of fascinating that we noticed.\n\nBack in December of last year is when we noticed that backwardation occurred in the bitcoin futures curve in our markets and other comparable markets like CME \u2014 which is fascinating to us, because that just creates a lot of opportunity for people who have bitcoin on their balance sheet to go in and capture those spreads and actually make money moving Bitcoin into the futures ecosystem, which is really awesome.\n\nThat\u2019s a real advantage our exchange has because CME is a cash-settled product. So, moving your bitcoin to capture those spreads, it\u2019s very difficult. There\u2019s a lot of slippage. You\u2019re doing a lot of weird trades to get in and out of that product \u2026\n\nNow, from the end of the quarter last year to now, we\u2019re seeing more of a steepening of the curve, which is what I would expect given the interest rate environment that we\u2019re in right now.\n\nBlockworks: Who do you view as your direct competition now?\n\nDunn: That\u2019s a great question. If I\u2019m going to be honest, nobody.\n\nWe\u2019re the only ones that are focusing on the physical deliverable space in the US, the only ones that are continuing to build that out. And I think that\u2019s obvious from our customers who we talked to. There\u2019s just not a lot of options out there.\n\nBlockworks: How would you answer that same question last fall?\n\nDunn: I\u2019ll be honest, the way that we view [or viewed] other exchanges, particularly FTX, is that we didn\u2019t really view them as competition.\n\nBecause ultimately, it\u2019s a different customer base. You had a lot of US firms that were setting up these offshore businesses to go and trade those. But that necessarily wasn\u2019t our target market.\n\nLook, when you look at a lot of the US firms now, they\u2019re not willing to set up those offshore companies. They\u2019re not. It\u2019s too much risk for them \u2014 particularly after the FTX collapse.\n\nThat\u2019s actually been great marketing for us because you know, like, even look at Deribit. There\u2019s a lot of platform risks there that are being underappreciated from a risk perspective. One thing we saw with Deribit: it had [at one point] like $20 billion of open interest.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nBitnomial\u2019s trading team booked its first block trade in recent weeks, which was executed between crypto trading firm DV Chain and Electric Capital, a long time digital assets-focused investment manager with a venture capital arm and other investment strategies under its trading purview.\n\nA spokesperson for the company told Blockworks that the exchange\u2019s largest transaction was booked on April 5, adding that Bitnomial\u2019s interest \u201chit record levels since the beginning of\u201d the first quarter.\n\nDunn said that the exchange\u2019s view is that competition is coming, and that it\u2019s \u201cwhen, not if\u201d that Wall Street banks start making markets on crypto options in real numbers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

(CoinDesk/TradingView)\n\nThe chart shows that the total market cap of altcoins (white line, blue arrows) rose more than 60% to $1.39 trillion in the two months after the BTC dominance rate turned lower from 48% in July 2021.

        "content": "A Greenville-based cryptocurrency business led by a former gubernatorial candidate says a bankrupt vendor that provides high-powered computers vital to its operations is threatening to pull the plug unless it's paid more money.\n\nGEM Mining has asked a judge to intervene in its dispute with Austin, Texas-based Core Scientific Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection in December.\n\nThe legal battle provides a glimpse into the murky world of bitcoin mining, an industry that relies on thousands of computers to solve complicated math equations to earn the world's most valuable form of crypto.\n\nGEM said in court documents that data processor Core Scientific has repeatedly threatened to reject contracts to provide computer equipment, known as \"miners,\" as part of its restructuring unless GEM agrees to renegotiate the agreements \"with a materially higher hosting rate.\"\n\nDuring a conference call last month, Core Scientific executives said they would \"intentionally shut down\" GEM's equipment by April 3 if GEM did not agree to terminate or rework the deals, according to court documents.\n\nJudge David Jones called the allegations \"troubling\" in an April 13 order requiring Core Scientific to provide uninterrupted service to GEM pending a hearing on May 22.\n\nJohn Warren, GEM's president and a 2018 candidate for South Carolina governor who previously founded Lima One Mortgage, did not respond to requests for comment last week. Neither did an attorney representing Core Scientific.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing stems in part from the shakeup following last year's epic collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the subsequent arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried on fraud charges. Bitcoin tumbled from a 52-week high of $42,945 to a low of $15,516 in the wake of the scandal. Prices have since stabilized at around $30,305 but are still far below their peak.\n\nCore Scientific \u2014 which provides mining services for itself and clients at data centers in five states \u2014 also felt the brunt of soaring energy costs, with electricity to power and cool the company's high-speed computers one of its biggest expenses. The company listed about $1.3 billion in debts and has obtained financing to reorganize its business."

        "content": "Macro Markets, hosted by crypto analyst Marcel Pechman, airs every Friday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel and explains complex concepts in layman\u2019s terms, focusing on the cause and effect of traditional financial events on day-to-day crypto activity.\n\nThis week\u2019s show starts by discussing the mutual fund industry, including the well-known BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard, and how the top 15 asset managers handle over $54 trillion. Can you believe it? That money could buy all the companies listed in the S&P 500 Index, plus all the gold, fiat bills and coins in circulation on the planet.\n\nPechman explains how the $120 trillion managed by these mutual funds relies heavily on fixed income and why it remains their top bet despite paying below inflation for the past three years. Moreover, the show discusses how passive investment strategies might catapult Bitcoin (BTC) into a whole other sphere, instantly gaining adoption among institutional investors.\n\nThe next segment of Macro Markets answers a question from \u201cFilm City,\u201d who posed a question in last week\u2019s YouTube video comments. Pechman explains why the 40-year low unemployment rate in the United States is not necessarily bullish for risky investments. On the other hand, the analyst illustrates how an increase in the unemployment rate, especially above 10%, is certainly detrimental to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe show concludes by examining the U.S. credit default swap (CDS) rates, which recently reached an 11-year high. Those insurance instruments activate if the debt issuer fails to honor their payments \u2014 in this case, the U.S. government Treasury. Pechman explains why the U.S. CDS is not worrisome at the moment and how one should analyze specific risks to the U.S. dollar currency.\n\nIf you are looking for exclusive and valuable content provided by leading crypto analysts and experts, make sure to subscribe to the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

        "content": "Robert Kiyosaki, the world-renowned investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book, \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d has once again voiced his support for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a tweet on April 21, he declared his love for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, citing its independence from government and central bank control as one of its primary strengths.\n\nKiyosaki\u2019s tweet reminisces about the time when Bitcoin first hit $20,000 and then subsequently crashed to zero. He initially believed that the digital currency was finished, but over time, he watched as it climbed back up to $6,000. It was then that he decided to invest heavily in Bitcoin because, in his words, \u201cpeople support BC, not FED or Gov.\u201d\n\nKiyosaki is confident that Bitcoin will continue to rise in value, predicting that it will eventually reach $100,000. He believes that the currency\u2019s popularity and adoption will continue to grow as more and more people recognize the benefits of using a decentralized currency that is not subject to the whims of governments or central banks as it does not need to be bailed out by the government or the federal reserve.\n\nWHY I \u2764\ufe0fBITCOIN: Years ago I watched BC climb to $20k then drop to 0. I thought BC finished. Slowly watched BC climb to $6 k & I bought lots. WHY? Because people support BC not FED or Gov. BC did not need FED or Gov bailout because BC people\u2019s money. BC to $100k. Long live BC. \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 21, 2023\n\nKiyosaki on Bitcoin\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of the digital asset, according to the author, is its independence from government or central bank control. Unlike fiat currencies, which governments and central banks can manipulate, Bitcoin\u2019s value is determined solely by the market forces of supply and demand.\n\nThis feature makes the cryptocurrency a popular investment option for people who are concerned about the traditional financial system\u2019s instability and volatility.\n\nKiyosaki also had harsh words for the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and President Biden, whom he accused this week of lying about the state of the US economy. In his opinion, the US is on the verge of a financial collapse, and investors should be looking for alternative investments like Bitcoin to protect their wealth.\n\nHe also predicted a massive backlash for the US dollar, stating that it is no longer the world\u2019s reserve currency. He believes that the US is no longer the \u2018playground bully\u2018 and that other countries, particularly China and Russia, are working to undermine the dollar\u2019s dominance."

Therefore, many gaming platforms require a minimum of information from you.\n\nProvably fair\n\nEvery Bitcoin slots online casino offers proof of fairness. Various algorithms are used here to verify and in turn, confirm that all games are fair. This way you can play in peace and not have to worry about playing unfair games.\n\nCrypto slots casino also has a higher RTP percentage.

Namely, there is no single center where the result of each round is generated. In other words, the network is supported by many users around the world.\n\nDisadvantages of Crypto Slots Online\n\nResponsibility\n\nWhen you start playing crypto slots you immediately take responsibility for all payment transactions. This is where you need to be very careful and take it seriously. The fact is that once you send a transaction it will be impossible to roll it back or refund it. So watch what you do and how you do it.\n\nFewer options\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency has become popular it is still very young and has some drawbacks. You can note the scarcer selection of Bitcoin online slots than traditional fiat slots.

There are wagering requirements for each bonus you receive at the Bitcoin casino. For example, you received a Match Bonus of 1 BTC with a wager x45.

You need to become familiar with the games as well as the technology used in them. So we have deduced some tips on how to play vest crypto slots.\n\nThe first thing you need to remember is to choose games that have an RTP of at least 95%. This will help you get back more for fewer spins Choose slots with Low Volatility until you get the hang of it. Why? Because Low volatility will allow you to make more frequent, but smaller winnings. So you'll stay afloat longer. Once you get the hang of it, you can choose other Volatility options Try to choose games that have no jackpot or a low jackpot value. This will allow you to earn higher winnings When you're on the lookout for games with big winnings, start playing the slots with the biggest jackpot figure. Undoubtedly, this is very risky. But, if you win, you will recoup all your expenses and efforts You can use the bonuses and take part in the Loyalty Program. This will enable you to start playing with larger amounts of money so that you can increase your chances of winning big money Be sure to set a win-loss minimum and a lose-lose maximum at which you must stop playing.

        "title": "Will Crypto Recover? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies suffered tremendously in 2022. Scandals and bankruptcies rattled several large and popular names in the space, against a backdrop of raging inflation and painful anti-inflation policies. From market-darling growth stocks to overpriced real estate properties, anything risky took a massive price cut.\n\nOf course, cryptocurrencies led that race to the bottom, and many investors lost their enthusiasm for the crypto sector after price cuts like these:\n\nCryptocurrency Price 12/31/2021 Price 12/31/2022 Change Bitcoin (BTC -0.12%) $47,192 $16,604 (65%) Ethereum (ETH -1.02%) $3,715 $1,199 (68%) XRP (XRP -1.65%) $1.36 $0.35 (59%) Cardano (ADA -1.95%) $0.84 $0.25 (82%)\n\nWas that the beginning of the end for crypto investments? Did the crypto bubble pop once and for all last year? Or should you expect at least some of these plunging coins to make another comeback?\n\nHere's what I think about these burning questions. Let's see if you agree or not.\n\nHistorical perspective\n\nLet's rewind to 2013. Bitcoin was the only name in the game back then, but that was more than enough fuel for some head-turning market action. The token was worth less than $13 per coin when it performed its first \"halving\" in November 2012. That's a preordained 50% cut in the rewards earned for mining a new Bitcoin block, scheduled to occur roughly every four years. The inflation-killing event inspired more people to try their hand at Bitcoin mining and the token soon soared.\n\nBitcoin prices rose to $130 by August 2012 and then peaked at $1,151 in December. That's when a leading cryptocurrency exchange was hacked, popping that bubble with authority. Bitcoin retreated to roughly $180 per coin amid loud proclamations that the whole cryptocurrency concept was just a mirage with no real value. We Fools poked fun at the fledgling crypto market with the fictional FoolCoin launch on April 1, 2014. Har de har har.\n\nAnother surge, peak, and crash followed in 2017, about one year after the next halving. This time, Bitcoin's moves led the pricing action in thousands of newer cryptocurrencies, including all the names listed in the table above. The trading volumes were also much higher and the price moves saw more coverage in traditional news outlets. Bitcoin prices nearly reached $20,000 per coin this time. Yet, another crypto winter followed and plenty of investors swore off cryptocurrencies forever. The old joke just wasn't funny anymore, right?\n\nThe next halving during the COVID-19 lockdowns in May 2020 didn't seem to do much at first, as Bitcoin prices held firm for several months at roughly $10,000. Still, another bull run followed in 2021 and Bitcoin prices soared above $60,000 a couple of times. Some of the same people who had given up on crypto in 2018 took this market seriously again. Non-fungible tokens were red-hot for a while. Some store chains started accepting payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even Dogecoin (DOGE 8.56%).\n\nAnd then, you know, the inflation-inspired retreat from risky investments followed. The eternal death of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Cardano was announced from the rooftops. This is different somehow. This really is the end. There's no coming back from the devastating price cuts you saw in that handy little data table.\n\nRight?\n\nDon't call it a comeback (crypto has been here for years)\n\nWell, the rumors of crypto's death have been exaggerated many times before and I expect another full recovery. You see, these nifty digital currencies have game-changing implications for every corner of the financial world. The market is off to a good start in 2023, too.\n\nThe government seems to have tamed the inflation beast at long last. The economy may go through a recession this year but should come out stronger on the other side. Investors are interested in riskier growth-oriented ideas again, including cryptocurrencies. The four digital currencies listed above are up by at least 43% year to date, led by Bitcoin's 73% upward charge.\n\nAnd there are several additional growth catalysts in the cards right now:\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is about one year away. The exact date depends on how quickly people and companies are earning their Bitcoin-mining rewards, but the last block at the current rewards rate should fall near the end of April 2024. You've seen what usually happens a few months later. History doesn't repeat itself but it does tend to rhyme. This cyclical pattern alone seems almost certain to spark a fresh bull run next year.\n\nRegulators and crypto projects are hammering out a future framework for crypto regulation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against XRP's managing body, Ripple Labs, is awaiting a judgment after more than three years of claims, filings, and high-profile media sparring. When that gavel bangs, it should bring some much-needed clarity to how the SEC and other government agencies should treat the crypto market as a whole. Even a draconian ruling in the SEC's favor would be better than the rudderless boat crypto investors have been stuck with so far.\n\nThe inflation crisis gave a lot of people the idea that traditional financial systems may not be perfect after all. Cryptocurrencies could have the power to right many of the old-school banking market's wrongs, for example. Just a couple of usable and widely adopted decentralized finance (DeFi) apps would light a fire under whichever blockchain network powered the new app. Even a smaller hit could do the trick for a modestly sized crypto like Cardano, while Ethereum's needle is harder to move.\n\nBitcoin's predictable halving events may set the rhythm of the crypto market, but in the long run I'm much more interested in robust regulations and mass-market adoption of DeFi apps. That's where the crypto market's real value springs from. Without developers and app users, cryptocurrencies don't mean a thing.\n\nSo there is no doubt in my mind that cryptocurrencies will soar again. The timing and magnitude of the next rise is up for discussion, though. Again, look for successful DeFi apps and invest in the cryptocurrencies that make them tick. Ideally, you already own some before the rocket launch starts without much advance notice."

        "content": "123RF\n\nNinepoint Partners is changing the name and investment objective of its Bitcoin ETF to focus more broadly on digital asset and blockchain companies.\n\nUnitholders approved Ninepoint\u2019s proposed change in a vote on Thursday. At the end of May, the Ninepoint Bitcoin ETF will become the Ninepoint Web3 Innovators Fund (TSX: TKN; TKN.U), investing in companies operating in the decentralized internet, blockchain and digital assets.\n\nThe fund may continue to own bitcoin indirectly through other Canadian cryptocurrency ETFs, according to a notice sent to unitholders last month.\n\n\u201cBitcoin, while important, is now one of several significant innovations enabled by blockchain,\u201d the notice said. \u201cThe new strategies will give unitholders access to a much larger investment universe, while remaining focused on digital asset innovation.\u201d\n\nMore Web3 and digital asset companies have gone public, Ninepoint said, creating investment opportunities.\n\nThe Ninepoint Bitcoin ETF launched in January 2021 and other manufacturers released similar products around the same time, as the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soared.

        "content": "Bitcoin price in India and international markets dropped on Friday, after days of seeing its value rise. Industry experts say that at present, the selling pressure on investors has increased, triggering a period of volatility for crypto assets. On Friday, the world's most popular cryptocurrency opened with a loss of 2.22 percent to trade at $28,245 (roughly Rs. 23.2 lakh). While it remains the most expensive cryptocurrency, BTC is currently trading at a similar price on both national as well as international exchanges. In the last 24 hours, the value of Bitcoin has dropped by $613 (roughly Rs. 50,370).\n\n\u201cBitcoin dropped for the second consecutive session due to an increased selling pressure,\u201d Edul Patel, CEO of crypto investment platform Mudrex told Gadgets 360. Selling pressure garners heat when majority of the traders begin selling, indicating that the majority is betting on the market price to decrease. \u201cThis resulted in the loss of the rally and wiped out the weekly gains of Bitcoin. Despite this, there is still substantial support down to the late-March lows of $26,500 (roughly Rs. 21 lakh) and Bitcoin has seen a 40 percent increase over the past six weeks.\u201d\n\nEthereum followed Bitcoin in a conventional market movement and reflected a loss of 0.10 percent at the time of publishing. The value of Ether is hovering around the mark of $1,940 (roughly Rs. 1.60 lakh) after having fallen by $157 (roughly Rs. 12,899) in the last three days.\n\nOn Friday, most cryptocurrencies saw their prices fall alongside Bitcoin and Ether. These included altcoins like Tether, Binance Coin, USD Coin, Ripple, and Cardano as well as Dogecoin, Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot.\n\nShiba Inu, Avalanche, and Tron also saw their values drop on Friday.\n\n\u201cMarket performance has been sideways with a downward bias in the last 24 hours. The two-day continuous drop could be triggered by a $400 million (roughly Rs. 3,268 crore) sell order on Binance. On the regulatory front, the US seems to be lagging as market liquidity seems to be moving away from the country. Greed seems to be on a decline, as the crypto fear and greed index stands at 50, down two points in the last 24 hours and lowest since March 15,\u201d Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch told Gadgets 360.\n\nThe overall crypto market valuation dipped by 1.45 percent over the last 24 hours. As of Friday, the crypto market cap stood at $1.20 trillion (roughly Rs. 98,26,980 crore), showed the data by CoinMarketCap. In the otherwise top-to-bottom loss-ridden price chart, LEO and Bitcoin SV managed to record miniscule price hikes.\n\nWhile there are several factors that could have led to the crypto market hitting a speed breaker after rallying for days, it could also be due to the possibility of stricter oversight that could make it risky for miscreants to engage with the sector. The European Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly backed the European Union's (EU) first set of rules to regulate the cryptoasset markets.\n\nCalled MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets \u2014 these rules largely revolve around consumer protection and prevention of market manipulation and financial crimes in the crypto sector. The MiCA bill is aimed at preventing insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation of crypto-assets.\n\n\u201cThe crypto market faces headwinds, but long-term tailwinds for Bitcoin are highlighted in 3iQ's 2023 Outlook. Key market indicators showed a \u2018Sell' sentiment amidst prices of BTC and ETH decreasing after a good run in the past few days. Investors must proceed with caution,\u201d Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX told Gadgets 360.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nApple is opening its first stores in India, one in Mumbai and the other in Delhi.

        "title": "Israel's Central Bank Launches Digital Currency; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Signuptoken.com Can Capitalize - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In recent years, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have gained significant attention as widely used digital currencies. However, alongside these established players, newer cryptocurrencies like Signuptoken.com (SUT) have also emerged as potential contenders in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nAmidst this changing payment landscape, Israel\u2019s Central Bank is reportedly considering the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which refers to a digital form of fiat currency issued and regulated by a country\u2019s central bank.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Digital Shekel Or SHAKED?\n\nThe Steering Committee on the Potential Issuance of a Digital Shekel, or \u201cSHAKED,\u201d is in charge of the Bank of Israel\u2019s investigation into the feasibility of releasing a digital shekel. They have identified a number of scenarios that could influence the creation and use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), including things like CBDC issuances by other nations, a decline in the use of cash in transactions, the adoption of stablecoins or other private payment methods, competition within the domestic payment system, and technological developments in the payments industry.\n\nThe Bank of Israel acknowledges the necessity to proactively address these issues and maintain control over the nation\u2019s payment system as the landscape of digital currencies continues to change. As a viable means of navigating these adjustments and ensuring that Israel stays at the forefront of financial innovation, CBDC is being taken into consideration. Although negotiations over the creation of \u201cSHAKED\u201d are ongoing, no official decision has been made.\n\nWhy Does Signuptoken.com Gain Attention\n\nSignuptoken.com (SUT) has unveiled groundbreaking features poised to revolutionize the crypto world, positioning it as a valuable asset comparable to gold.\n\nSUT, an ERC-20-based cryptocurrency, is committed to generating financial growth for its members. Despite being a relatively new player in the crypto space, Signuptoken.com has ambitious plans to launch on the Uniswap blockchain once it reaches one million sign-ups.\n\nWhat sets Signuptoken.com apart from other altcoins is its unique approach to fundraising. Unlike traditional initial coin offerings (ICOs) or presale programs, Signuptoken.com only collects email addresses, ensuring equal opportunity for all to increase their financial assets. By joining the exclusive Millionaires Club email list, members may even become eligible for early retirement.\n\nPoised to be a safe asset, Signuptoken.com (SUT) has responded to the clamor from its esteemed Millionaires Club members by introducing a highly anticipated referral system. Also, SUT ensures the security of its funds by taking measures to instill confidence in its platform. It acquired audits and secured listings on established crypto platforms such as CoinSniper and Solidity Finance.\n\nBitcoin And Ether \u2014 Likened To Gold\n\nAccording to CoinTelegraph, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether are similar to safe-haven investments like gold in that they offer stability during macroeconomic turbulence. She cites their endurance over the most recent banking crisis, outperforming other asset classes, as proof of their widespread acceptance and adoption, pointing to a potential upheaval of the established order of things.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies gain popularity and come under regulatory pressure from the US government, Wood anticipates that they will play a significant role in the upcoming election. But only some people are as enthusiastic about this idea as she is. The world\u2019s largest hedge fund\u2019s founder, Ray Dalio, is skeptical of Bitcoin due to its volatility and central banks\u2019 unwillingness to accept it as a legitimate form of payment. After the US dollar and the euro, gold continues to be a substantial reserve held by central banks, according to Dalio.\n\nThe emergence of cryptocurrencies and the growing interest in CBDC by Israel\u2019s Central Bank reflect the changing landscape of digital assets. With \u201cgold\u201d cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SUT establishing their existence in the crypto world and CBDC being considered a potential digital currency by central banks, the future of payments and financial systems is likely to be shaped by the continued evolution of digital assets.\n\nProvide Your Email on the Signuptoken.com Roster\n\nWebsite: https://www.signuptoken.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SignUpToken_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/SignUpToken\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could be facing resistance at key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000, with the potential for a stock market downturn with the Federal Reserve tightening into a recession that could affect all risk assets.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have had a pivotal status since 2020, with definable diminishing supply and low but increasing adoption making a strong case for long-term bullishness.\n\nOn April 21, Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone stated that the yield curve\u2019s highest probability since 1982 suggests a growing consensus that the worst of a US recession may be over. However, this could potentially lead to large pullback risks, according to McGlone.\n\nMcGlone tweeted: \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 may be running into a wall of resistance at the key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000. Our bias is bullish in the long term for the top cryptos, but an overwhelming force of the stock market going down with the Fed tightening into a recession has the potential to lower the tide for all risk assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the riskiest.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are among high-risk assets. Source: Mike McGlone\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and Ethereum is closely tied to technological advancements and increasing adoption. Many experts believe that these cryptocurrencies will continue to gain mainstream acceptance as more businesses and individuals recognize the benefits of decentralized financial systems.\n\nSince the turn of the year, Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase of approximately 70%, while Ethereum has climbed just above 60%. Interestingly, a recent historical pattern has emerged as the value of Bitcoin has again reached 15 ETH after six years.\n\nDespite the impressive performance of these digital assets and surpassing key price levels of $30,000 and $2,000 in April, both have experienced significant pullbacks in the last week. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $28,077, down 1.88% on the day and 8.91% over the previous week. Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second-largest asset by market cap, is currently trading at $1,908, down 1.75% in the last 24 hours and 9.86% in the last week.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s recent pullbacks may cause temporary concern, their overall upward trend and potential for long-term growth remain. Investors should remain vigilant of potential downside risks, especially in light of broader market conditions.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The users of the widely used Telegram messaging app now have the ability to purchase, withdraw, and exchange Bitcoin (BTC). It is noteworthy, however, that the Wallet bot and its associated services, which allow for these functions, were created by a third-party, as opposed to being developed by Telegram itself.\n\nIn fact, the Wallet bot and such similar services are created by third-party developers using Telegram\u2019s open bot API. This means that anyone can utilize the API to develop their own crypto-related bot, without any direct involvement from Telegram.\n\nThus, users of the @wallet web interface can now access buy, withdraw, exchange, and make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions directly through Telegram\u2019s web interface in Bitcoin, as per the latest announcement from the @wallet account on April 21. This move builds upon the existing services surrounding cryptocurrencies that are already popular within the chat program. Notably, the announcement states:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is now available on the @wallet web interface, along with a new instant exchange. You can now buy, withdraw, exchange, and make P2P transactions with BTC directly through our updated web interface. It is now possible to buy Bitcoin using a bank card or the P2P market in the \u201cBuy & Sell\u201d section of our user-friendly interface.\u201d\n\nThe announcement also reminded users that the updated \u201cExchange\u201d of the platform can now instantly swap Bitcoin, Tether (USDT), and Telegram Open Network (TON) with each other.\n\nAs the popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies continue to grow, it will be interesting to see how Telegram and other third-party industry players continue to innovate and adapt to meet the changing needs and expectations of users around the world."
