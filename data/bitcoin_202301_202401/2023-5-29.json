This will make it more difficult for someone to view your private key at a glance. Step 5: Send crypto to your paper wallet. After sending your crypto, keep the wallet in a secure location, away from potentially damaging elements like moisture and heat. Since crypto is virtual, you can send crypto to any wallet, whether paper, digital or physical, as long as you have an address to use.\n\nWhat You Need to Open a Cryptocurrency Account\n\nOpening a cryptocurrency account is quick if you have the necessary details. A few wallets even allow you to open multiple user accounts on the same wallet. Remember, you'll need to provide the necessary KYC details; these details help exchanges and wallets keep money laundering and other financial crimes in check.\n\nResearch the Cryptocurrency Account\n\nRunning background checks before you sign up with an exchange/wallet is crucial. These checks save you a lot of headaches and prevent you from falling into the hands of scammers posing as legitimate business owners. The first place to look is the company's website. There are several questions to ask, including:\n\nDoes the website look suspicious?\n\nDoes the URL correspond with the company's name?\n\nWho runs the exchange?\n\nAlthough many things are anonymous in the crypto space, owners of wallets/companies rarely are. If you\u2019re satisfied with the company\u2019s website authenticity, head to social media to check out its official social media handles. Also, pay attention to any red flags and listen to what other people are saying about the company. Do a lot of people say it\u2019s inefficient?\n\nSign Up\n\nTo use a cryptocurrency wallet/exchange for the first time, you need to sign up with some details and documents to give the exchange some background information on you. Here is the information most exchanges require:\n\nName\n\nDate of birth\n\nEmail address\n\nPhone number\n\nHome address\n\nSocial Security number\n\nDriver\u2019s license or passport\n\nUnderstand the Basics\n\nSince cryptocurrency is money, it needs to be kept safe: away from hackers, scammers, and other bad actors. If these people get ahold of your crypto, they can send it to another wallet or sell it for money, leaving you with nothing. In choosing a crypto wallet storage option, consider one with a security system that makes it difficult for anyone to hack your wallet and steal your assets.\n\nThere are different types of secure wallet options you can go with, including crypto exchanges, cold storage wallets, paper wallets, and hot crypto wallets. If you want to access your crypto more quickly, choose either a crypto exchange or hot crypto wallet. If you\u2019d like to focus more on security and storing cryptocurrency offline, cold storage or paper wallets are ideal options.\n\nCryptocurrency Exchange\n\nA crypto exchange is an application that lets you access crypto and carry out crypto-related transactions. Most wallets are free to download but involve a transaction fee for sending or selling cryptocurrency. Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken are all popular examples of cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nCold Storage Wallet\n\nA cold storage wallet is a type of wallet not connected to the internet. With these types of wallets, your crypto is safe from hackers, so these are ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency. Many users go for Trezor and Ledger.\n\nHot Crypto Wallet\n\nUnlike a cold wallet, a hot crypto wallet is connected to the internet. That means you need an internet connection to access your crypto. Although these wallets are more susceptible to hacks, they make accessing your crypto frequently for transactions easier. Numerous hot crypto wallets are available on the market today, but Guarda and Mycelium are good picks based on security.\n\nPaper Wallets\n\nAlthough paper wallets are now phasing out, they\u2018re still practical for storing cryptocurrencies. A typical paper wallet contains your private keys and your address printed on it. Paper wallets are relatively safe, but if the paper gets stolen or goes missing, the thief could easily read your keys and take your crypto, or you lose your crypto forever.\n\nKnow the Risks\n\nNo cryptocurrency storage method is 100% safe, even with the various security measures.\n\nRisks of Storing Cryptocurrency in an Exchange\n\nStoring your crypto on an exchange is often regarded as the easiest way to keep it, but you can also quickly lose it to hackers. If your exchange gets attacked, you could permanently lose your crypto, even though your passwords and private keys are safe.\n\nRisks of a Cold Storage Wallet\n\nTypically, cold storage is the safest way to store your crypto away from online hacks and security breaches. But you can also lose your crypto, especially if you lose your device or it gets stolen. Furthermore, water or fire damage can permanently cause your crypto to go down the drain, especially if you did not back up your seed phrase.\n\nRisks of a Hot Crypto Wallet\n\nHot crypto wallets pose almost the same risk as storing crypto on exchanges. However, they\u2019re relatively safer. If your device gets hacked or you accidentally install malware, your wallet could be completely drained.\n\nRisks of a Paper Wallet\n\nYour paper wallet is highly vulnerable to physical damage or wear and tear. These wallets are pretty inexpensive, but they\u2018re easy prey for attackers. The attacker only needs to get a hold of the paper to rob you. So, even if you have copies of the paper wallet, it doesn't help much since your private keys are on any copy you print out or keep in your device\u2019s storage as a soft copy.\n\nFactors to Consider When Opening a Cryptocurrency Account\n\nSecurity: Review an exchange\u2019s security features before setting up an account. We recommend you go with one that offers two-factor authentication or an additional security measure to the usual password feature.\n\nFees: Many exchanges charge a small fee for sending, selling, or buying cryptocurrencies. If you would like to trade cryptocurrency often, your best bet is to go with an exchange with moderately low fees to save you the extra money spent on charges.\n\nNumber and quality of supported cryptocurrencies for options trading: If your goal is to trade a variety of crypto assets, you will need to choose an exchange that offers more than just BTC and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nStorage and custody: Using a custodial storage option like a hot crypto wallet is better if you're not too good with keeping passwords and passphrases. These options keep your crypto for you and can help you recover your password if you forget it.\n\nCustomer service: Although many exchanges have a customer care center or an email to reach them in case of issues, it\u2019s preferable to go for one with a live chat option. Those have faster reply times and can be convenient for wallet-related emergencies.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow Do You Store Large Amounts of Cryptocurrency? You can store large amounts of cryptocurrencies by any storage method, but storing them in cold wallets is best. Cold wallets are the most secure option and can store any amount of cryptocurrencies for a long time.\n\nCan You Store Cryptocurrency Offline? You can store cryptocurrency online as well as offline. Offline storage options include cold storage wallets and paper wallets. These days, people rarely use paper wallets. You should get a solid, secure cold wallet to keep your crypto offline.\n\nAre Cryptocurrency Exchanges Safe? Cryptocurrency exchanges are not entirely safe. An exchange can easily be hacked, and your wallet might be part of the unfortunate ones affected. You should store crypto on exchanges mostly if you make a lot of crypto transactions or trade crypto.\n\nCan You Store Multiple Cryptocurrencies in One Wallet? Yes, you can store multiple cryptocurrencies in one wallet. Many cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges automatically create separate wallets for as many cryptocurrencies as they support. In a few cases, you\u2019ll have to manually add a new wallet for the new crypto you want to store. The best wallet to store all cryptocurrency would be a cold, portable and secure one."

        "title": "Preparing for The Bitcoin Halving Event Projected in April 2024 - ReadWrite",
        "content": "Bitcoin halving is an event that takes place approximately every four years, or more precisely every 210,000 blocks. This event reduces the amount of new Bitcoin created and earned by miners by half. The halving is part of Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmonetary policy,\u201d encoded in its software, to control inflation by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation.\n\nHow Bitcoin Halving Works\n\nWhen Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, the reward for miners was 50 Bitcoins per block. After the first halving in 2012, this reward was reduced to 25 Bitcoins per block. The second and third halvings, in 2016 and 2020 respectively, further reduced the reward to 12.5 and then 6.25 Bitcoins. This trend will continue until all 21 million Bitcoins have been mined, which is estimated to occur around the year 2140. After that, miners will be compensated with transaction fees.\n\nWhy Mine Bitcoin At All\n\nMining Bitcoin, a process where transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, called the blockchain, can offer several potential benefits. Here\u2019s why someone would consider mining Bitcoin:\n\nFinancial Rewards: One of the primary reasons individuals mine Bitcoin is for the potential financial rewards. Bitcoin miners are rewarded with Bitcoin itself. Given its value (hovering at roughly $25,000 currently per coin), even mining a fraction of a Bitcoin can yield a considerable financial return. The Bitcoin rewards can either be held as an investment (anticipating future price increases) or sold for immediate cash. Supporting the Bitcoin Network: Bitcoin mining plays an essential role in securing the Bitcoin network. The process of mining involves solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. This process ensures the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network, preventing double-spending and maintaining the decentralized nature of the system. Entry into the Cryptocurrency Space: Bitcoin mining offers an entry point into the broader cryptocurrency and blockchain technology world. It\u2019s a hands-on method of learning about how blockchain technology works and understanding the intricacies of cryptocurrencies. Potential for Increased Value: If the price of Bitcoin rises, miners could make substantial profits. When Bitcoin\u2019s price increases, the value of the rewards also increases. Given the historical performance and growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, some miners choose to hold onto their coins with the hope that they will be worth more in the future. Independent Income: For those willing to invest in the necessary hardware and who have access to cheap electricity, Bitcoin mining can be a form of independent income. Once the initial investment in equipment is covered, miners can continue earning Bitcoin as long as they can cover the ongoing costs of electricity. Advancement in Tech Knowledge: Mining Bitcoin can be a fascinating hobby for tech enthusiasts. It provides the opportunity to learn about advanced computer hardware, software, and networking.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s crucial to note that Bitcoin mining is not for everyone. It requires substantial upfront investment in specialized hardware, and the cost of electricity can be high. Moreover, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin increases over time, meaning that the potential rewards decrease unless you continually upgrade your equipment. Therefore, it\u2019s important to research thoroughly and understand the financial and technical implications before embarking on a Bitcoin mining venture.\n\nWhy Bitcoin Halving Occurs\n\nBitcoin halving serves several key purposes:\n\nControlled Supply and Scarcity: Bitcoin\u2019s inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed Bitcoin with a maximum supply of 21 million coins to maintain its scarcity, mimicking the supply rate of commodities like gold. Halving ensures the steady, predictable release of new Bitcoins into the economy. Inflation Control: By reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, halving controls inflation. The decrease in supply can increase demand, potentially driving up the price. This deflationary measure distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional fiat currencies, which often depreciate over time due to inflation. Miner Incentives: Miners play a critical role in maintaining and securing the Bitcoin network. The block reward, though periodically halved, provides an incentive for miners to continue their work. Over time, as the block reward decreases, transaction fees become a more significant portion of miners\u2019 income, ensuring the network\u2019s long-term sustainability.\n\nThe Implications\n\nBitcoin halving can significantly impact the cryptocurrency\u2019s price and the broader crypto economy. In the past, halvings have often led to price increases due to the reduced supply of new coins and increased demand. However, these events also introduce uncertainty, as the reduced mining reward can lead to decreased mining activity if miners find the endeavor less profitable.\n\nFor Bitcoin holders, halving represents a moment of potential opportunity but also risk. Predicting how the market will react to a halving event is challenging. While there\u2019s often excitement leading up to the event, the actual price response can vary.\n\nFrom the perspective of a new Bitcoin user, here are some considerations for the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024:"

        "content": "Bitcoin miners can breathe a sigh of relief as a plan by the White House to impose stiff taxes on the sector appears dead in the water following a larger deal between President Joe Biden and senior Republicans to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its debt.\n\nThe tax was initially floated by the White House in early May under a proposed law titled the Digital Assets Mining Energy excise tax. Known as the DAME Act, the bill called for a 10% tax on the electricity used by Bitcoin and other crypto miners beginning in 2024, with that figure rising to 30% by 2026.\n\nWhile the White House has yet to provide a further update on the tax proposal, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) said on Sunday that the mining tax will not take effect.\n\n\u201cYes, one of the victories is blocking proposed taxes,\u201d Davidson tweeted on Sunday in response to a crypto executive who noted the excise tax did not appear in a new bill describing the terms to raise the so-called debt ceiling. The exchange came after Davidson tweeted a link to the bill, which reflected a compromise between the White House and Republican leadership over raising the federal debt limit.\n\nThe Treasury Department did not immediately respond to an enquiry from Fortune about the status of the DAME Act, but the legislation appears to have no path forward for now given that another senior Republican has said the debt ceiling deal \u201cblocks Democrat demands for new taxes and rejects all $5 trillion of Biden\u2019s proposed tax increases.\u201d\n\nIn its initial proposal, the White House claimed that the DAME Act would have raised $3.5 billion in revenue over 10 years.\n\nCryptocurrency mining has become a prominent target of environmentalists and Democratic policymakers in recent years, who claim that it needlessly burns vast amounts of energy while providing few benefits\u2014and, in some cases, higher electricity bills for consumers\u2014in towns where mining operations are based. Crypto advocates, in turn, claim the environmental case against Bitcoin mining is overstated, and that critics misunderstand the industry, much of which is based on renewable energy in the U.S.\n\nWhile Bitcoin does require considerable energy to operate, newer blockchains use only a relative trickle of electricity in comparison because they rely on a different system known as proof of stake. This includes the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, which adopted proof of stake last fall.\n\nEven though the White House plan to tax crypto mining appears dead for now, the debt ceiling deal still faces hurdles, and must pass both the House and the Senate before it goes into effect."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe days of Bill Clinton appearing on stage at cryptocurrency conferences and Matt Damon starring in crypto exchange ads are long gone. Speculative mania has given way to more sober reflection. In the US, the energy usage of miners is under fresh attack. The White House has suggested that mining companies pay tax equal to 30 per cent of the cost of electricity they use.\n\nDespite this, the price of bitcoin has climbed 67 per cent this year, exceeding $30,000 in April before falling back. Ethereum, the second- largest digital token, is following the same trajectory. It may be less than half its high point, but the pause on interest rate rises has lifted bitcoin\u2019s price. A technical event known as the halving could drive it higher still.\n\nThere will only ever be 21mn bitcoin in circulation. Every four years, rewards for mining bitcoin are chopped in half. Right now, miners receive 6.25 bitcoin for verifying a new block of transactions on the blockchain. Next year this will drop to 3.125. Eventually the reward will be cut to $0. The lead-up to previous halvings has coincided with bitcoin price rises.\n\nIt is possible, however, that dwindling enthusiasm for the crypto industry will damp the halving\u2019s impact. Venture capital funding for crypto and blockchain start-ups dropped 80 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2022, according to data from PitchBook. Excitement around artificial intelligence that has lifted prices in semiconductor companies and other tech stocks has not extended to crypto companies. Regulator warnings have made banks more skittish about holding their assets after FTX\u2019s failure.\n\nBitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis as a decentralised alternative. But the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this year did not trigger renewed conversion to bitcoin. Lack of transparency remains a problem. So does criminal activity. Price moves dictated by technical mechanisms that create scarcity show how far the digital asset is from ushering in a brand-new financial system."

        "title": "Bitcoin is on a collision course with 'Net Zero' promises - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Each year at the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP), individual countries are pressured to ramp up their emissions reductions promises and showcase evidence they are taking steps to meet them.\n\nWith Bitcoin mining blamed for using as much power as an entire country, and politicians searching for easy targets to strike, the industry appears to be on a collision course with these global commitments to achieve net-zero emissions.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not possible to ban Bitcoin completely, lawmakers and regulators can tank the price and make life very difficult in the years ahead for the number one cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are signs it\u2019s already happening.\n\n\n\nA report from the European Commission at the end of 2022 stated that EU countries \u201cmust be ready to block crypto mining,\u201d and the trading block\u2019s new MiCA rules were at one stage set to include a ban on Bitcoin mining. The recently adopted legislation still leaves this door ajar, however, aiming to \u201creduce the high carbon footprint of crypto-currencies\u201d by making service providers \u201cdisclose their energy consumption.\u201d\n\nAcross the pond, the Biden administration has proposed a 30% excise tax on the power consumption of U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations. The tax would be imposed regardless of whether the power is renewable, with the administration arguing Bitcoin mining\u2019s power consumption of renewable energy will slow down the transition to Net Zero. That\u2019s in contrast to a New York moratorium on Bitcoin mining in 2022 that exempted firms powered by renewable energy.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government appears to be taking to heart the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy\u2019s September 2022 report that claimed the environmental impact of producing cryptocurrencies could \u201cimpede U.S. efforts to combat climate change.\u201d\n\n\n\nFormer member of the Bitcoin Mining Council and independent researcher Hass McCook doesn\u2019t mince his words about threats to ban mining.\n\n\u201cGovernments should focus on greening their grids, which miners rely upon, as opposed to trying to ban an unbannable technology.\u201d\n\nThe Swedish government was behind last year\u2019s push to outlaw crypto mining in the EU and, last month, took steps to price Bitcoin miners out of the market by abolishing various tax incentives. Starting in July, Sweden will increase the electricity tax by 6,000% from 0.006 Swedish kronas ($0.0006) to an extraordinary 0.36 kronas ($0.035) per kilowatt-hour (kWh).\n\n\n\n\u201cGovernments around the world are actively looking at Bitcoin mining\u2019s energy consumption,\u201d explains Brad van Voorhees, co-founder and CEO of Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol, which incentivizes the use of renewables for mining.\n\nArtist Benjamin Von Wong created \u201cThe Skull of Satoshi\u201d sculpture. He says he\u2019s not anti-Bitcoin, he just wants to lower emissions. (VanWong)\n\n\u201cSweden has already imposed a 6,000% tax on energy for BTC mining, and the Biden administration has proposed a 30% tax, which would undoubtedly mean miners move offshore,\u201d he adds.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe tax will likely never pass in the U.S., but nonetheless, the sector should focus on clean energy use and data transparency to mitigate this risk.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers agree with van Voorhees that Net Zero is an opportunity to set Bitcoin mining on a new and more sustainable path. Morten R\u00f8ngaard is a member of the Nordic Blockchain Association and CEO of Reality+, a Web3 and blockchain company.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe collision between Bitcoin and Net-Zero commitments is a call to action. It\u2019s an opportunity to harness the power of innovation and renewable energy, steering both towards a greener and more inclusive landscape,\u201d he says.\n\nGood cop, bad cop\n\nThe focus on Bitcoin mining power usage was given additional impetus after Ethereum moved to proof-of-stake last year and saved 99.95% of its energy consumption as a result. While Bitcoiners believe PoS stands for \u201cpiece of shit,\u201d the success of the blockchain\u2019s energy transformation has made Bitcoin look like it is stuck in a corner using anachronistic tech.\n\nThere are now groups demanding changes to Bitcoin\u2019s underlying protocol as well.\n\nThe Change the Code lobby group is using the Merge to lobby for changes to Bitcoin. (Change The Code)\n\nGreenpeace\u2019s Change the Code Not the Climate (Clean Up Bitcoin) lobby group is pushing to change Bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work, to proof-of-stake.\n\n\u201cWe know a basic software code change would reduce Bitcoin\u2019s energy use by 99.9%. If only 30 people \u2014 the key miners, exchanges, and core developers who build and contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s code \u2014 agreed to reinvent proof-of-work mining or move to a low-energy protocol, Bitcoin would stop polluting the planet. So why isn\u2019t Bitcoin changing its code?\u201d\n\nThis is misinformation, however, given the Bitcoin community needs to agree on a change, rather than a small group of just 30 people. The Bitcoin community split over the much smaller change of increasing the block size in 2017, leading to the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV forks, so the chances of an agreement to change the fundamental nature of the technology are hard to envisage at this point.\n\nThe industry\u2019s big hope to date has been that progressively moving away from fossil fuels to rely more on sustainable and renewable power, such as wind, solar and hydroelectric power, will placate governments.\n\n\n\nBut as the Swedish and U.S. governments have said, that may not be enough. For governments and regulators trying to comply with their international climate change commitments, there will be a bunch of hard decisions to be made. Even a mining industry 100% powered by renewable energy could be a target, as that emissions-free energy could be freed up at the stroke of a pen to help a more politically valuable industry, like manufacturing, meet emissions targets.\n\nHow much power does Bitcoin use?\n\nIt\u2019s probably just water vapor. (Pexels)\n\nThe Cambridge Bitcoin electricity consumption site estimates Bitcoin network power demand and is updated every 24 hours and works with all major actors to cut down on carbon emissions. It conducts \u201cexperiments\u201d to evaluate Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint assuming the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nBy using the latest annual power consumption estimates of 143.63 TWh and, assuming that all this energy comes exclusively from coal, and is generated in an inefficient coal-fired power plant, the Bitcoin footprint would be 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. That\u2019s around 0.35% of the world\u2019s total annual emissions.\n\nBitcoiners point out that the network uses less power than the banking system (200 TWh) and a majority of the power used by the industry is renewable. They also claim mining can incentivize renewable electricity generation and make marginal green power projects viable.\n\nBut even taking these factors into account, mining still uses a ton of power, to which Bitcoiners argue that it\u2019s energy well-spent securing the hardest and best money known to humanity.\n\nBut non-Bitcoiners tend to look at the power use of the alternatives. The site estimates that Ethereum is using around 6.76 GWh per year. In other words, Bitcoin is using 21,000 times more power per year.\n\nAccording to the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, before its transition to proof-of-stake, a single Ethereum transaction used 200.05 kWh of electricity, on par with how much the average U.S. household uses in 6.7 days.\n\n\n\nAccording to Digiconomist, that consumption is now as low as 0.03 kWh, and the carbon footprint stands at 0.01 kgCO2, which is equivalent to the energy used when watching two hours of YouTube.\n\n\n\n(Please don\u2019t email us to point out that the network uses the same amount of power regardless of the number of transactions \u2014 we know, it\u2019s just illustrative).\n\n\n\nDigiconomist\u2019s Ethereum Energy Consumption Index highlights just how radically different PoW power consumption is to PoS.\n\nEthereum\u2019s energy consumption plummeted after it moved to proof-of-stake in 2022.\n\nU.K.-based Block Dojo describes itself as \u201cthe largest Bitcoin blockchain incubator in the world,\u201d but in fact, it\u2019s based on the Bitcoin fork Bitcoin SV. It claims to be responsible for 24% of all blockchain investments in the United Kingdom. Chairman James Marchant says the energy use of Bitcoin is an opportunity for other blockchains like Bitcoin SV.\n\n\u201cThe total energy use versus the number of transactions BTC can process per day is catastrophic. BTC does not implement the protocol as per the Satoshi white paper. We are seeing developers and entrepreneurs turning to a scalable blockchain solution away from BTC, and Net-Zero objectives is one of several key reasons for this,\u201d he says.\n\nMovement for change\n\nThe people driving the crypto industry forward are likely to be the younger demographic, Generation Z, which is increasingly sensitive to climate change concerns.\n\nBut the industry is not hiding its head in the sand, with bodies like the Bitcoin Mining Council attempting to address such concerns.\n\nWelcoming Bitcoin miners of all shapes and sizes \u2014 it accounts for about half the world\u2019s miners now \u2014 the Council is a voluntary forum that shares best practices and \u201ceducates the public on mining.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Council is led by Michael Saylor (BMC)\n\nIts most famous, and first, member is MicroStrategy boss Michael Saylor, who arranged the first meeting of the Council and is a strong adherent for managing miners\u2019 energy use and employing sustainable alternatives.\n\nIts latest quarterly report (based on self-reports from a survey and then estimated across the remainder of the industry) suggests miners are currently using a 58.9% sustainable energy mix.\n\nRenewable energy can potentially mitigate Bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact. There are many examples of mining facilities now powered by solar, wind or hydroelectric energy or using \u201cstranded\u201d energy or mining using flared gas that would otherwise be wasted. If the renewable energy lobby\u2019s claim that green power is the cheapest form of electricity, then miners will inevitably use more of it, explains McCook. \u201cBitcoin mining is a perfectly competitive industry. This means players will do anything to maximize profit. Anything. This means they chase the cheapest possible electricity available. This is increasingly becoming renewable,\u201d he says.\n\nDarren Franceschini, co-founder of Fideum Group \u2014 a London-based crypto funding company \u2014 agrees the industry is embracing wind and solar as much for economic reasons as anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith fossil fuel prices soaring, miners are economically driven to achieve Net-Zero emissions,\u201d he says. Carbon pricing mechanisms and green energy subsidies could further promote the adoption of renewable energy sources within the mining sector.\n\nWill regulators believe Bitcoin can incentivize renewables?\n\nThere is a PlanB, however. (Pexels)\n\nBitcoin advocates like Nic Carter argue that mining can play a role in growing the sustainable energy sector by using excess electricity capacity for energy efficiency or helping to finance renewable projects.\n\n\u201cThe need for electricity in the creation of Bitcoin is obviously a concern. At the same time, it is one of the best-use cases for excess electricity capacity vital in the renewables sector,\u201d says Toby Lewis, co-founder of Ordinals Bot. \u201cWith the right incentives, Bitcoin can become a financing mechanism for the renewable grid.\u201d\n\nThe question is not whether or not this argument is correct \u2014 and it\u2019s a source of contention even in the crypto community \u2014 it\u2019s whether governments and regulators can be convinced it is.\n\nIt will be a hard sell to convince lawmakers, but Josef T\u011btek, a Bitcoin analyst at hardware wallet provider Trezor, argues that Bitcoin mining is a net positive for climate change.\n\n\u201cContrary to some claims, Bitcoin mining is beneficial for the environment and bootstraps renewable energy generation,\u201d he says, noting mining pops up wherever there\u2019s cheap renewable power.\n\n\u201cFor example, just recently, we have learned that the kingdom of Bhutan has been mining Bitcoin with its hydroelectric stations for years.\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether the result of a clampdown on mining by bigger countries will see mining nomads shift operations to crypto-friendly countries that provide sustainable power like Bhutan.\n\nThe small hermit kingdom in the Himalayas is watered by glaciers in the mountains. It has huge stores of hydroelectricity, providing 30% of the country\u2019s GDP and literally fuelling the homes of nearly all of its 800,000 residents. According to Forbes, the country is following the example of El Salvador by becoming one of two countries to run a state-owned mining operation.\n\nNick Jones, CEO of Zumo \u2014 a crypto-as-a-service platform \u2014 believes that crypto is well-placed to quickly reduce emissions.\n\n\u201cAll sectors need to rapidly decarbonize, and crypto has an opportunity to do this more quickly than most. Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint is due almost entirely to electricity consumption, and we have the technology to rapidly decarbonize. Significant progress has been made, but there is still much to do,\u201d he says.\n\nSurging demand for Bitcoin\n\nThe unexpected recent addition of NFTs and tokens to Bitcoin via Ordinals has created a huge wave of additional demand for the blockchain. Last month, the daily record for inscriptions using Bitcoin Ordinals was broken four times as users flooded the network with images, games and other content.\n\nDaniel Santos, co-founder of Gamepay, argues that Ordinals is the first successful protocol built on Bitcoin and will result in more adoption, which in turn will mean more mining and more power to be generated.\n\n\u201cGovernments will step in and regulate mining for sure, especially as Ordinals take hold. There will also be a drive for green energy, even if a lot of Bitcoin mining is done with green energy,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI suspect governments will require miners to have licenses to mine.\u201d\n\nOrdinals could be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back for Bitcoin and its energy consumption. Moreover, as the crypto winner begins to thaw, the demand for the currency is also expected to surge as the currency\u2019s price climbs.\n\nThis is an issue that will run for years to come. Prepare for demonstrations against Bitcoin and more proposals to ban either the protocol or mining.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is unbannable, there is a need to address emissions and to be on the front foot in the public debate. Whether change comes from within the industry or via external intervention is a question the crypto community needs to urgently address."

The company said it will launch a Bitcoin mining arm in Uruguay, a country that generates 94% of its electricity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. On top of that, the stablecoin issuer said it will also invest in Uruguay's energy production industry and hire more team members to support its expansion.\n\nThe move is part of Tether's treasury management strategy, which involves investing up to 15% of its net profit in Bitcoin. Previously, Tether revealed it held about $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, which accounts for around 2% of its total reserves. Tether said it aims to minimize the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining through the use of renewable energy sources, while also adding to the security of the Bitcoin network."

        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Tuesday morning trading in Asia, giving up a portion of Monday\u2019s gains on what looked like profit taking. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses. XRP was the exception, rising on speculation the token is underpriced considering potentially positive developments in the lawsuit XRP developer Ripple Labs faces in the U.S. Stock futures in the U.S. moved higher after President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin Mccarthy agreed to raise the government\u2019s debt ceiling over the weekend, averting a default. However, inflation and interest rate hikes might now come back into focus for investors.\n\nBitcoin dips, XRP gains\n\nBitcoin fell 1.45% over the last 24 hours to US$27,792 at 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still trading 2.95% higher for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency peaked at US$28,300 on Monday morning in Asia, the highest price since May 8.\n\n\u201cWith both parties in the US finding agreement to raise the debt ceiling, investors were allowed a dose of optimism,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cOn the short run, though, this might indeed be an opportunity for profit taking, for traders thinking the global economy is still due for more pain and a hard landing,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nEther fell 0.96% to US$1,898, while holding a weekly gain of 3.62%.\n\nXRP was the only top 10 non-stablecoin token logging gains for the past 24 hours, rising 2.09% to US$0.4922 and moving up 6.72% for the week. The token received a boost from developments in the lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Ripple Labs, whose blockchain payment protocol uses XRP.\n\nThe court will make public internal documents showing former SEC director William Hinman in 2018 said sales of Ether tokens were not securities transactions, which could undermine the SEC allegation that Ripple Labs sales of XRP were an illegal securities sale, tweeted pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton on Sunday.\n\nDeaton, who said the Hinman documents will move into the public domain even if the SEC and Ripple agree to settle, added that XRP is underpriced and predicted it will attract more buyers and climb to US$1 and beyond.\n\nThe total market cap of cryptocurrencies dropped 1.13% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while the 24-hour market volume dipped 5.54% to US$29.64 billion.\n\nForkast 500 gains; Bitcoin NFT sales fall\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.34% to 3,409.12 in the 24 hours to 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 0.66% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 18.19% in the past 24 hours to US$16.06 million, according to CryptoSlam data. The Solana, Polygon and Cardano networks also saw increased NFT sales in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain, vying with Ethereum for NFT supremacy, saw its 24-hour NFT sales drop 33.64% to US$4.31 million as the hype for $OXBT BRC-20 NFTs faded. The newly launched NFT collection, which accounts for more than a third of sales on the Bitcoin network, posted a 50.97% sales slide in the 24 hours to US$1.52 million.\n\nNakamigos, an Ethereum-based NFT collection, saw the largest sales in the same period across the market, rising 12.27% to US$2.06 million.\n\nElsewhere, Reddit Collectible Avatars, an NFT collection launched by Reddit in July 2022 that act as customizable avatars on the popular social media, had almost 10 million holders as of Tuesday morning, according to data from Dune Analytics, signalling a milestone for Reddit\u2019s Web 3.0 initiatives.\n\nThe growing popularity of Reddit\u2019s NFT project lies in its simplicity, said Web3 technology firm Redeem Co-Founder Toby Rush in an earlier commentary. \u201cImportantly, Reddit\u2019s activation avoided any mention of NFTs. The assets were easy to understand and use, brought real utility to those who held them, and could be purchased with traditional fiat, not crypto.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures gain\n\nU.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 1:50 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures moved up 0.11%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.23%, and the Nasdaq futures rose 0.39%.\n\nThe gains came on the back of the debt ceiling deal in Washington, likely removing the risk of a U.S. government default. The bill would suspend the debt limit until January 2025, and will be voted on by Congress on Wednesday.\n\nThe bill included a block on a proposed tax on electricity used by cryptocurrency miners, a positive for the U.S. crypto mining industry.\n\nWith the debt ceiling threat seemingly removed, U.S. investor focus could return to interest rates after the personal consumption expenditures price index released on Friday showed inflation remains a risk, indicating the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on June 14 to decide on rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 40.4% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 59.6% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, down from 63% on Monday, but still a sharp increase from 25.7% on May 22.\n\nBoosted by the rate hike expectation and relieved debt ceiling concerns, treasury futures linked to the U.S. government bond market rallied on Monday, according to Bloomberg, which could add to the pressure on riskier assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nOther economic data out this week include the U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on Thursday, a measure of the health of manufacturing industries. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 a contraction."

However, on-chain and options market data allude to incoming volatility in June.\n\nThe Bitcoin Volatility Index, which measures the daily fluctuations in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price, shows that the 30-day volatility in Bitcoin\u2019s price was 1.52%, which is less than half of the yearly averages across Bitcoin\u2019s history, with values usually above 4%.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the expectation of volatility is a \u201clogical conclusion\u201d based on the fact that low volatility levels were only seen for 19.3% of Bitcoin\u2019s price history.\n\nThe latest weekly update from the on-chain analytics firm shows that Glassnode\u2019s monthly realized volatility metric for Bitcoin slipped below the lower bounds of the historical Bollinger Band, suggesting an incoming uptick in volatility.\n\nBolinger Bands for Bitcoin monthly realized volatility metric. Source: Glassnode\n\nLong-term Bitcoin holders metric points to a price breakout\n\nThe on-chain transfer volumes of Bitcoin across cryptocurrency exchanges dropped to historically low levels. The price is also trading near short-term holder bias, indicating a \u201cbalanced position of profit and loss for new investors\u201d that bought coins during and after the 2021-2022 bull cycle, according to the report. Currently, 50% of new investors are in profit, with the rest in loss.\n\nHowever, while the short-term holders reached equilibrium levels, long-term holders were seen making a move in the recent correction, which underpins volatility, according to the analysts.\n\nGlassnode categorizes coins older than 155 days in a single wallet under long-term holder supply.\n\nThe gray bars in the image below show the long-term holder (LTH) binary spending indicator, which tracks whether LTH spending averaged over the last seven days is adequate to decrease their total holdings.\n\nIt shows previous instances when LTH spending increased, which was usually followed by a volatility uptick.\n\nLong-term holder spending binary indicator.

However, prolonged compression of volatility can indicate a big incoming move in terms of price.\n\nBitfinex\u2019s latest Alpha report shows that the DVOL index, which represents the market\u2019s expectation of 30-day future implied Bitcoin volatility, slipped to 45 from a reading of 50 right before the expiry, which represents a yearly low.\n\nThe DVOL index for Bitcoin options.

        "content": "A big part of the appeal of investing in cryptocurrency is the chance to get a massive return on your investment. Because crypto is so volatile, it could make you rich. Or, you could lose practically everything you invested in the blink of an eye.\n\nIf you keep up with crypto at all, you've probably read stories about people who have put all their money in it. The lucky ones have even come out ahead, with some making millions of dollars. Success stories like these get a lot more common during bull markets, and they're enough to make you wonder \"what if?\"\n\nLet's say you decided to invest all your money in crypto. While there's no predicting exactly what the results would be, there are a few things you can expect with complete certainty.\n\nYou'll have an extremely volatile and stressful portfolio\n\nThere's no overstating how volatile cryptocurrency is. Take Bitcoin (BTC) as an example. If you had invested in 1 Bitcoin at the start of 2020, it would have cost you $7,195. Here are some of the ups and downs you would've then experienced if you held on to your 1 Bitcoin:\n\nApril 14, 2021: $63,577 (up 784%!)\n\n$63,577 (up 784%!) July 21, 2021: $29,972 (down 53%)\n\n$29,972 (down 53%) Nov. 10, 2021: $69,045 (up 130%!)\n\n$69,045 (up 130%!) Nov. 9, 2022: $18,562 (down 73%)\n\nThis kind of volatility is a whole lot easier to stomach when it's all hypothetical, or when you have just a small portion of your portfolio in crypto. When crypto is 100% of your portfolio, the volatility becomes far less exciting and much more stressful.\n\nSafe storage becomes even more important\n\nOne of the challenges of cryptocurrency is deciding where to store it. There's no perfect solution, which is especially worrying if you put all your money in crypto.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others. In fact, you've probably used this company's technology in the past few days, even if you've never had an account or even heard of the company before. That's how prevalent it's become. Sign up today for Stock Advisor and get access to our exclusive report where you can get the full scoop on this company and its upside as a long-term investment. Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount. Get started\n\nThe simplest option is to store your crypto with the app, exchange, or stock broker where you buy it. This works best from a convenience perspective, as you don't need to transfer your crypto anywhere. Also, if you lose access to your account, you can reset your password to get back in. But storing your crypto this way also has some downsides:\n\nCrypto exchanges are a popular target for scammers. You'll need to keep your login information safe and watch out for phishing scams.\n\nYou'll need to keep your login information safe and watch out for phishing scams. You're at risk of losing your crypto if the exchange goes bankrupt. As the collapse of FTX shows, exchanges aren't always nearly as safe as they seem.\n\nYou could also use one of the many crypto wallets for storage. With a wallet, your crypto is entirely in your possession. That means you're not at risk of losing it if the exchange where you bought it collapses. But if you lose access to your wallet and your recovery phrase for it, then you've lost access to your crypto, and there's no way to get it back.\n\nYou'll have tough decisions to make even if you're successful\n\nThe best-case scenario is that your crypto investments are successful. To be clear, this is a long shot. Even if it happens, what comes next can be much more challenging than people realize.\n\nLet's say you had $50,000 to invest, and you put it all in crypto. Six months later, your decision was a success, and your investments are worth $100,000. Here's the question -- what do you do now? You could:\n\nKeep everything the same and let it ride. After all, you don't want to miss out if those cryptocurrencies continue to increase in value.\n\nAfter all, you don't want to miss out if those cryptocurrencies continue to increase in value. Take some profits and also keep some money invested. For example, you sell $50,000 worth to get your initial investment back, and keep the remaining $50,000 in crypto.\n\nFor example, you sell $50,000 worth to get your initial investment back, and keep the remaining $50,000 in crypto. Sell everything and take your $50,000 in profits. This way, you're not at risk if those cryptocurrencies decrease in value.\n\nIt's a good position to be in, but it's not an easy decision to make. And if you decide to sell anything, you're going to owe short-term capital gains taxes, because you didn't hold your investment for at least one year. Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. Depending on how much you make and your income from other sources, you could end up owing 30% or more of your profits in crypto taxes.\n\nMany investors like to add crypto to their portfolio as an alternative investment. There's nothing wrong with that, within reason. If you want to devote 5% to 10% of your portfolio to crypto because you think it's the future or you're excited about the profit potential, go for it. But putting everything in crypto isn't recommended. It's far too risky, which is the opposite of what you want in an investing strategy."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dropped below US$28,000 on Monday afternoon in Hong Kong after breaching the mark earlier in the day. All top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, excluding Tron (TRX), rose in the 24 hours leading to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Ethereum leading gains at 2.8%.\n\nAsian markets were mixed while European bourses and U.S. stock futures gained. A tentative agreement on Sunday between U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin Mccarthy to raise the world\u2019s biggest economy\u2019s debt ceiling boosted investors\u2019 risk-taking appetite.\n\nSee related article: Beijing releases Web3 white paper, highlights challenges in talent, rules\n\nJustin Sun-linked tokens on the watch\n\nBitcoin\u2019s see-saw of around US28,000 was part of its 2.51% rise over the past 24 hours, bringing its weekly gain to 3.95%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, traded at US$1,900.\n\nTRX, the native cryptocurrency of the Tron blockchain founded by blockchain entrepreneur Justin Sun, fell 0.27% to US$0.07721. However, it managed a 0.95% increase over the previous week. TRX has been deflationary in recent months, with more than 13 million TRX tokens burned on Sunday, blockchain data shows.\n\nHuobi Token (HT), another cryptocurrency affiliated with Sun through his stake in the cryptocurrency exchange of the same name, also posted losses on Monday, falling 0.2%. This occurred despite Huobi\u2019s announcement of offering spot and managed services to professional and retail customers. With a market value exceeding US$533, HT ranks as the 79th largest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nHuobi said it officially submitted an application notice to the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission on Monday, to obtain a virtual asset exchange license.\n\nHong Kong will allow retail trading for investors from June 1, as the city aims to become a crypto hub.\n\nThe total crypto market volume rose 56.34% to US$33.67 billion, while total crypto market capitalization gained 2.04% to US$1.16 trillion in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum NFT sales surge\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn non-fungible tokens, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.37% in the 24 hours to 6.45 p.m. in Hong Kong. Forkast ETH NFT Composite remained unchanged in 24 hours but dropped 0.32% on the week.\n\nOver the same period, Ethereum NFT sales rose 12.78% to US$14.89 million, according to CryptoSlam data. Mutant Ape Yacht Club recorded the highest sales volume among NFTs in the Ethereum blockchain, with US$1.93 million.\n\nSales of $OXBT BRC-20 NFTs, a Bitcoin Ordinals collection launched last Thursday, topped US$2.39 million in the past 24 hours, playing a major role in boosting NFT sales on the Bitcoin network by 12.86% to US$6.81 million.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, there is a big difference forming between what we are seeing on Ethereum and what we are seeing on Bitcoin. The community is splitting into people who value [user experience], and corporate partners and one who values ultimate security/scarcity and immutability. While I think there are strengths to each, there IS a place for both,\u201d said Yohann Calpu, chief marketing officer at Forkast Labs.\n\nU.S. futures rise, Asian markets mixed\n\nCNC Laser cutting of modern industrial technology. Image: Envato Elements\n\nAsian stock markets were mixed on Monday as traders assessed China\u2019s declining industrial profits data amid a shaky economic recovery. Profits of China\u2019s industrial firms slid 20.6% in the first four months of 2023, with the manufacture of computers, communication and other electronic devices seeing a 53.2% plunge in profits. According to Bloomberg on Monday, the data points to turmoils in China\u2019s post-Covid economic recovery.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite gained 0.28%, the Shenzhen Component Index lost 0.80% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index fell 1.16%.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 1.03% to close at a 33-year high on Monday on news that a preliminary deal to raise the debt ceiling was reached over the weekend. Japanese stocks reported strong earnings this month, while a weak yen will likely boost the country\u2019s exports.\n\nEuropean stocks rose on Monday, with Germany\u2019s DAX 40 adding 0.22% while the benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.13% on successful U.S. debt ceiling talks. Investors are now looking forward to estimates of the Eurozone\u2019s inflation rate, worldwide purchasing managers\u2019 index, and the jobs report in the U.S. due for release on Friday.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures moved up 0.14%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.21%, and the Nasdaq futures rose 0.40%. U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.\n\nPresident Biden announced on Sunday a bipartisan budget agreement with House Speaker Mccarthy, which, according to Biden, would avoid a U.S. government default, and is ready to move to Congress for votes.\n\nHowever, the deal could still face objections in the Congress.\n\nOn the U.S. inflation front, the April personal consumption expenditures price index rose 4.4% on the year, accelerating from 4.2% in March. The data points to a robust labor market and stubborn inflation in the U.S., which could open doors to further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Fed will meet on June 14 to decide its next move on interest rates, now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 37% chance the central bank will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 63% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 25.7% on May 22."

Over the same time, Ether rose 0.31% to US$1,904.\n\n\u201cThe sideways of Bitcoin is very much related to the current market risks and the fear,\u201d Aziz Kenjaev, the chief security officer of trading platform WuuTrade, said in a statement. \u201cInvestors\u2019 activity during any economic risk talks is cautious. Hence the sideways in US$26,000 \u2013 US$30,000. Positive talks about the U.S. economy will break this crab walk in a positive way.\u201d\n\nXRP led the day\u2019s gains among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, rising 4.67% over the past 24 hours to US$0.5028. The coin started picking up momentum after pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton tweeted on Sunday, that the court will make public internal documents from 2018 showing former Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman saying sales of Ether tokens were not securities transactions, which could undermine the regulator\u2019s case against Ripple Labs.\n\nThe U.S. securities watchdog sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in December 2020, claiming that XRP was a security and that Ripple had conducted unregistered securities transactions by selling the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales rally dampens\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.98% in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong while rising 0.56% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s secondary non-fungible token (NFT) sales fell 23.14% to US$4.2 million in the last 24 hours, with $OXBT BRC-20 NFTs dropping 50.20% to US$1.3 million, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 2.08% to US$15.6 million, boosted by Nakamigos sales rising 72.04% to US$1.5 million. Sales for the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, also rose 52.91% to US$1.2 million.\n\nAmong Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast POL NFT Composite was the only loser over the past day with a 1.98% decline. Secondary NFT sales volume on the Polygon network has dropped 21.8%, CryptoSlam\u2019s data shows. Matic, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum scaler, recorded Tuesday\u2019s largest drop among cryptocurrencies, with a 2.52% fall to US$0.9052.\n\nAsian stocks rise, U.S. debt deal boosts futures\n\nHong Kong stock market exchange and charts information via led computer monitor displayed in Mong Kok.

Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.30%, the Shanghai Composite increased 0.086%, and the Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.44%.\n\nInvestors are looking ahead to the release of China\u2019s Purchasing Manager Index data scheduled for Wednesday. The economic signal may provide insights into the post-pandemic recovery trajectory of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nGlobal investor sentiment received a significant lift by U.S. President Joe Biden announcing on Sunday that a preliminary deal to raise the government\u2019s US$31.4 trillion debt ceiling was reached, a move intended to avert a \u201ccatastrophic default.\u201d The House Rules Committee is slated to vote on the bill Tuesday afternoon, with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy anticipating that over 95% of Republicans will support the bill.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, as concerns over a governmental default eased.

He also cautioned the US dollar's global dominance is under threat, and higher interest rates will be necessary to rein in soaring prices.\n\nThe cofounder of George Soros' Quantum Fund also slammed US lawmakers for the current debt-ceiling debacle, touted commodities as the best hedges against inflation, and dismissed the idea that governments will embrace bitcoin.\n\nHere are Rogers' 7 best quotes, lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\n1. \"The next bear market will be the worst in my lifetime, because the debt has gone up by such staggering amounts in the past 14 years.\" (Rogers said the 2008 crash was caused by excessive amounts of debt, and borrowing has ballooned since then, suggesting a far worse downturn lies ahead.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \"We should always be concerned about Washington. They don't have a clue what they're doing. And they prove it day in and day out.\" (He was discussing the current political gridlock over raising the debt ceiling.)\n\n3. \"You should be extremely worried. If you're not, you don't know what's going on. Many countries are starting to look for alternatives to the US dollar, partly because of its horrendous debt problem. I'm looking every day, because I know that something bad is going to happen in the currency markets in the next two or three years.\" (Rogers was commenting on de-dollarization fears.)\n\n4. \"Interest rates are going to go higher worldwide. I don't know how high they have to go to kill inflation this time around. The world has never seen the debt and the spending and the money printing like in the last few years. So something is going to have to be very, very ruinous to solve this problem this time.\"\n\n5. \"There'll be trouble in all the markets \u2014 property markets, stock markets, bond markets, currency markets, everything. You have to learn about cash or selling short in order to survive what's coming.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \"I don't think that the world is going to convert to bitcoin. It will be computer money, but it will be government computer money.\"\n\n7. \"The best place to be when you have inflation is real assets, and real assets are commodities. The cheapest asset that I know is still commodities.\" (Rogers said he owns some silver and gold currently.)"

Discover SCENE\n\nAs the details of the agreement reached between President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on the U.S. debt ceiling were made public Sunday, one notable part of the deal appears to have blocked some taxes proposed by the Biden administration, including the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax.\n\nIf passed, it would impose a 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining firms\u2014a move that the Biden administration argued was required to limit the environmental and societal damage caused by crypto mining operations.\n\nPierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot Platforms, questioned whether \"the Administration's DAME excise tax proposal is gone?\" given that Bitcoin mining wasn't mentioned in the text of the bill, dubbed the \u201cFiscal Responsibility 5 Act of 2023.\u201d U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH-08) responded in a tweet that, \"Yes, one of the victories is blocking proposed taxes.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe debt ceiling agreement, which still faces thorough scrutiny and debates in Congress, comes in the form of a comprehensive 99-page bill aimed at suspending the nation's debt limit until 2025, thereby preventing a federal default, while simultaneously imposing restrictions on government spending.\n\nYes, one of the victories is blocking proposed taxes. \u2014 Warren Davidson \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@WarrenDavidson) May 29, 2023\n\nWhat is the Digital Asset Mining Energy tax?\n\nThe idea of implementing an energy tax was initially suggested in March of this year. Notably, the proposed Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) tax would be applicable to both digital asset miners operating on Proof-of-Work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks like Ethereum, regardless of the substantial differences in their energy consumption levels.\n\nUnder the proposed tax framework, digital asset miners would be obligated to disclose information such as the amount of electricity they consume, the source of that electricity (whether it is derived from renewable sources or not), and its corresponding value. This requirement would extend to off-grid power generation, including the utilization of otherwise wasted natural gas.\n\nIn a recent report released by the White House, the Biden administration reiterated its position that imposing financial constraints on miners is in the best interest of American communities and the environment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe proposal, however, faced criticism from crypto advocates.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining uses about the same as video games, and no one is calling for a ban on those,\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on Twitter earlier this month. \u201cThe environmental argument is a selective pretext to suppress anything that threatens elite power structures.\u201d\n\nYes, energy use is a concern (though somewhat overstated), but bitcoin mining uses about the same as video games and no one is calling for a ban on those. The environmental argument is a selective pretext to suppress anything that threatens elite power structures. Bitcoin, for\u2026 \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) May 3, 2023\n\nRepublican Senator Cynthia Lummis also blasted the proposal during the recent Bitcoin 2023 conference, saying that a thriving Bitcoin mining industry is not only a matter of national security, but also an issue of energy security.\n\nWhile urging Bitcoin enthusiasts to participate in groups that advocate for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency as part of the U.S. economy, Senator Lummis also expressed conviction that the proposed energy tax \u201cisn't going to happen.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals are the latest layer-2 solution enabling decentralized storage of digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals will now allow users to migrate their Ethereum ERC-721-based nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to the Bitcoin blockchain with the launch of the BRC-721E standard.\n\nThe BRC-721E standard was jointly launched by the Ordinals market \u2014 an Ordinals-based marketplace \u2014 and the Bitcoin Miladys NFT collection. The new BRC-721E standard enables the conversion of immutable, verifiable ERC-721 NFTs to Ordinals. Initially, metadata is not stored on-chain, but users can store a lower-quality preview image and include a reference to the Ether (ETH) burn in the raw image data.\n\nThe migration process starts by burning the ERC-721 NFT with an ETH call function. The burning of the NFT is an irreversible process and acts as an on-chain inscription method. To claim the ETH burn on Bitcoin, the user must inscribe valid BRC-721E data, after which the bridged NFT will appear on a custom Ordinals market collection page with complete metadata.\n\nThe indexers that check the burned NFT data inscriptions ensure that a token has no more than one valid inscription and that the genesis address matches the burn transaction call data.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals surpass 10M inscriptions as creator Rodarmor steps down\n\nThe Ordinals market claimed the fundamental principles of BRC-721E and the flexibility of the indexers allow for the protocol to evolve over time, despite the fact that metadata is initially not stored on-chain.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals has attracted widespread reaction from the crypto community since its launch in January 2023. The launch of the BRC-20 token standard in March created an experimental fungible token standard designed specifically for the Bitcoin blockchain. The combination of BRC-20 with Ordinals opened new gates for minting tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, with the crypto community seeing the emergence of many popular BRC-20 tokens, such as Ordinals (ORDI), Vmpx (VMPX) and Pepecoin (PEPE).\n\nThe number of BRC-20 tokens has skyrocketed from a few hundred in its first week to over 25,000 at the time of publication. However, the rise of Ordinals and the new token minting era has not been unanimously well-received, with many Bitcoin (BTC) proponents criticizing the new method as inefficient and wasteful.\n\nMagazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin \u2014 The Silk Road hacker\u2019s story"

        "content": "Change is in the air. Crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT) have been in a pretty brutal bear market for almost exactly a year now, which many, myself included, had projected to last for years.\n\nBut now, there are signs of life springing up all around, being driven by Bitcoin NFTs, and recent news of China opening the door for citizens to engage the blockchain again. The bear market may be over sooner than we had thought, so let\u2019s get into what\u2019s making me think that NFTs might just be back.\n\nNoteworthy Happenings\n\nChina is coming into NFTs and crypto, and Russia will use crypto to settle payments across borders. These two major announcements are bringing excitement back to the NFT and crypto markets and lead many to believe that these alone can turn the market around.\n\nCollectors are eying high-priced NFTs ahead of a potential incoming pump from Chinese investors looking to snatch NFT grails like CryptoPunks, BAYC and Azuki. An x-factor that not enough people are talking about yet is, what if they decided to dive into the mostly unexplored world of Bitcoin NFTs where opportunities may be even greater than the already expensive Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n9c5633eec1494d4082106924f68b42e7\n\n6cb7e0d5822d4f94890b7c0403522c78\n\nBitcoin NFTs are really starting to cook, and just yesterday the 10 millionth Ordinal was inscribed . This massive milestone many thought improbable just a few months ago, but believers in Bitcoin NFTs never had a doubt. At this point, no one can deny that Bitcoin\u2019s NFTs are here to stay, but the question of \u2018Will Bitcoin NFTs flip Ethereum NFTs?\u2019 is another story. I think they will.\n\nA new token standard was created on Bitcoin yesterday called BRC-721E . This will let traders bridge their Ethereum NFT over to Bitcoin by \u201cburning\u201d the Ethereum NFT and re-creating it on Bitcoin. Now we\u2019ll get to see traders\u2019 convictions on the Bitcoin ecosystem play out in real time.\n\nA new meta is emerging in NFTs which is to drop a new cryptocurrency (an ERC-20 or BRC-20 token) and then build an ecosystem around it, likely with NFTs. $OXBT is the new hottest BRC-20 collection on Bitcoin, and there are teases of upcoming utility for this token. Fun fact , $OXBT is now held by more wallets than any other individual digital asset on the Bitcoin blockchain other than BTC itself and its smaller denomination, Satoshis.\n\nStory continues\n\na4599e0a4dd145aeb61cc2d24f2dd35b\n\nThis hot new meta recently took off with new meme coins like $PEPE, $TURBO, $BEN, and $PSYOP looking for ways to drive more users to the token, and the concept now seems destined to shape the NFT scene for the foreseeable future.\n\nGaming on the cusp of taking over Web3\n\nGaming is on the cusp of taking over Web3. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, now has over 20 blockchain games listed on their store with some like Defimons now entering a closed beta.\n\nIf Mythos Chain\u2019s DMarket, and ImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained are any indication of what\u2019s to come (they are), we\u2019re in for a meteoric rise in NFT adoption. Just look at how the buyers/sellers and transactions compare to a typical PFP project.\n\n\n\n2a9870b110894ef6afe55c2126bd4afc\n\nSales from these two projects have propelled them into the top five for the past seven days, foreshadowing what\u2019s to come as blockchain games begin to enter the mainstream.\n\nd8d1482d3ccc4c458ecb33ecf14db76e\n\nPeep the charts\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m fascinated to see who Bitcoin\u2019s growth impacts more, Ethereum and its layer 2s, or Solana? Take notice of which chains aren\u2019t in the top 10 NFT Collection Rankings by Sales Volume for the past 7 days, and you\u2019ll see who it may be.\n\nNakamigos have had a sudden surge, as have Jack Butchers\u2019 art project Openens, pushing both ahead of Milady Maker and into the Top 10. Milady Maker continues to hang around with the big dogs, now with extra action that revolves around the new BRC-721E bridge that originated in the Milady project.\n\n\n\n\n\n5c6fad5d8fee4767872aa5e437fb3e7f\n\nBitcoin continues to fall from its previous seven-day highs, but other ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum are on the upswing. I expect this tug-of-war to continue until new users come into the space, and bring liquidity to be able to push both up at the same time.\n\n(Disclosure: The author of this commentary holds $OXBT)"

Can short-timeframe strength lead to an overall trend breakout?\n\nOpinions differ as May ends and brings a macroeconomic showdown that is already making itself felt: the United States debt ceiling deal.\n\nWith an agreement to raise the ceiling and avoid a U.S. government default almost here, risk assets may see relief across the board. However, since stock markets are closed until May 30, it will be a game of \u201cwait and see\u201d for Bitcoin traders to start the week.\n\nBItcoin itself, of course, is always open, and the debt ceiling appears to have formed an impetus for optimism despite representing little in terms of macroeconomic policy trends.\n\nWith that, the conversation within crypto is all about what happens next.\n\nCointelegraph looks at these and some other important factors to consider when it comes to BTC price action in the coming days.\n\nDebt ceiling deal nears Congress\n\nAfter several weeks of negotiations between Republican and Democrat lawmakers, the Biden administration has formed and presented a solution to the U.S. debt ceiling debacle and presented it to Congress.\n\nWhile it remains unknown whether it will pass, bets are already front-running the outcome.\n\n\u201cI think it is virtually certain that it will be passed,\u201d Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania, told CNBC, summarizing a popular theory.\n\nAn actual doom scenario, others have pointed out, is unlikely, as the deal stalling at this point does not immediately open the U.S. to a default scenario.\n\n\u201cThe coming week will still bring uncertainty around the debt ceiling as the agreement makes its way through Congress,\u201d trading firm Mosaic Asset said in the latest edition of its newsletter series, The Market Mosaic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll also get an updated report from the ISM on manufacturing sector activity, plus the May jobs report.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the dominant NFT platform in terms of trading volume and overall value, Bitcoin has undoubtedly swallowed up much of the buzz in the NFT space via the recent rise of the Ordinals protocol. And for Ethereum NFT holders who\u2019d rather be on Bitcoin, there\u2019s now a migration solution\u2014but it\u2019s a one-way trip.\n\nBitcoin Miladys, an NFT project that offers derivatives of the Ethereum-based Milady Maker profile picture (PFP) project, launched a bridge in partnership with marketplace Ordinals Market and the Xverse Bitcoin wallet. The BRC-721E token standard, as it\u2019s called, enables the bridge to migrate artwork and data over to Bitcoin via Ordinals.\n\nThe bridge lets holders of Ethereum NFTs\u2014defined by the ERC-721 token standard\u2014effectively move the asset to the Bitcoin blockchain via a burn-and-mint process. The original Ethereum NFT is sent to an inaccessible \u201cburn\u201d address, which means it\u2019s essentially destroyed on the chain, but then the asset is recreated on Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin Miladys were initially minted on Ethereum, so the bridge was initially designed to let its holders bring them over to Bitcoin. But as the Ordinals Market page describes, the BRC-721E token standard and bridge can work with any compatible Ethereum NFT.\n\nSome cross-chain bridges use an escrow wallet in the middle and hold the original NFT or asset, then create a new version on the target chain. That makes it possible to reclaim the original asset on the original chain by burning the secondary version.\n\nIt\u2019s a one way bridge by the way\ud83e\udd2d pic.twitter.com/vTCj8paFV6 \u2014 Bitcoin Miladys\ud83d\udc9e\ud83c\udf4a\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf38 (@BitcoinMiladys) May 28, 2023\n\nBut that\u2019s not possible with NFTs migrated to Bitcoin via the BRC-721E process. As mentioned, it\u2019s a one-way journey, and the original NFT is essentially destroyed in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe process may still prove appealing to Bitcoin aficionados, or perhaps NFT holders who believe that the buzzy rise of Ordinals will give their migrated NFT more value. However, there are potential risks to switching blockchains.\n\nFor example, back in February, a Bored Ape Yacht Club owner burned his original Ethereum NFT and minted a new version on Bitcoin via Ordinals. Soon after, one of the Bored Ape co-creators at Yuga Labs tweeted that the holder had \u201ceffectively given up\u201d the license to the myriad benefits and perks tied to Bored Ape NFT ownership.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol, launched in January, creates a way for people to \u201cinscribe\u201d digital media like artwork, PFPs, and even functional apps and games to the Bitcoin blockchain. Each \u201cdigital artifact\u201d is inscribed to a single satoshi, which is 1/100,000,000 of a full Bitcoin.\n\nMore than 10 million inscriptions have been made to date, with that milestone reached on Monday. The month began with just 3 million total inscriptions, and the latest surge has been fueled primarily by the rise of the BRC-20 standard, which uses Ordinals inscriptions to let users mint fungible tokens on Bitcoin\u2014such as meme tokens."

        "title": "Bitcoin 2030: Get ready for Hyperbitcoinization! - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Tue 30 May 2023 \u25aa 13 min of reading \u25aa by Satosh\n\nHyperbitcoinization is a concept that has been theorized by some of Bitcoin\u2019s most ardent supporters. It refers to a hypothetical state where Bitcoin would be universally accepted as currency. Is this truly credible, and what would be the consequences for the global economy?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s quest for world domination\n\nFor the past few years, an especially optimistic idea has been brewing within the Bitcoin community: hyperbitcoinization. It would be a state of adoption in which bitcoin is firmly established on a global scale, supplanting the US dollar as the new monetary standard.\n\nHyperbitcoinization scenario 1: Credible investment and unit of account\n\nIn the first scenario that can be imagined, bitcoin would be considered a reliable unit of account by a critical mass of individuals. In this scenario, Bitcoin would replace and even go beyond the gold standard. The asset would be accepted by numerous financial institutions, people would consider it a relatively stable investment (at least as stable as gold), and a reliable method for transferring money abroad.\n\nThis could happen after decades of slow adoption of Bitcoin, with ups and downs, without disrupting the social order. It doesn\u2019t require a fantastic imagination; it\u2019s a scenario that could naturally unfold over time.\n\nBut what does this mean for our economy? If Bitcoin becomes a reliable unit of account, it could have a significant impact on how we do business. International transactions could become simpler and more efficient. Individuals and businesses would have more control and sovereignty over their money.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that this hyperbitcoinization scenario doesn\u2019t mean that all transactions will be conducted in BTC. It\u2019s likely that fiat currencies will continue to play a significant role in the global economy.\n\nA few projections\n\nWe can envision some developments for Bitcoin within the framework of this first scenario. We can reasonably expect a reduction in Bitcoin\u2019s volatility but also an increase in transaction fees.\n\nIndeed, if the fees are not significantly higher, the network would be insecure. A malicious actor in one corner of the world could attempt to seize Bitcoin or launch a devastating attack to disrupt economies that have adopted it.\n\nHyperbitcoinization scenario 2: H-Bomb on the Fed\n\nLet\u2019s move on to the second hyperbitcoinization scenario.\n\nIn this scenario, Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise would lead to the creation of an economic regime in which any party that chooses not to use or is excluded from the Bitcoin network would be placed at an economic disadvantage. In this scenario, fiat currency would lose its luster. Gradually, the value of the dollar, euro, or British pound would converge towards zero. Why? Because they would become less desired by economic actors. When demand for an asset wanes, its price also plummets, all else being equal.\n\nFiat currencies still have power\n\nIt\u2019s important not to confuse the observation of a currency\u2019s inflation with its decline. Historically, inflation is a long-term structural observation, and it is expected to continue in the future. Nevertheless, major currencies like the dollar are by no means in decline. A one-dollar bill may be worth less than it was 20 years ago, but the dollar is more powerful than ever. The growth in the role of the dollar goes hand in hand with the volume of goods denominated in dollars, and there are undoubtedly more and more of them.\n\nTherefore, fiat currencies currently show no signs of decline, even if individual units are losing purchasing power due to central bank manipulations.\n\nThe H-Bomb Hyperbitcoinization scenario is only possible if nation-states voluntarily choose to relinquish their monetary power or, for some reason, lose their ability to issue fiat currencies.\n\nA slightly utopian scenario\n\nThis second scenario is therefore much more radical and controversial. It suggests that Bitcoin could not only fill the gaps of fiat currencies but completely replace them.\n\nThis means that those who don\u2019t adopt Bitcoin could find themselves economically disadvantaged. Just like if you were to do away with fiat currency today, you would likely face immense difficulties in receiving your salary or paying your electricity bills.\n\nVersion 2 of hyperbitcoinization requires the United States, China, the European Union, and other powerful economic entities to accept the helplessness caused by the loss of their monopoly over monetary production. Meanwhile, hundreds of trillions of dollars in value are absorbed by a headless protocol. Additionally, the rapid collapse of a fiat currency often constitutes a major disruption to the social order.\n\nThis (slightly utopian) scenario raises many questions. For example, how could such a situation come about? What could drive people to completely abandon their fiat currency in favor of Bitcoin? And what would be the effects on the global economy?\n\nA coalition of Bitcoin-Leading states?\n\nIn the context of this total conquest scenario, we have to consider a world in which Bitcoin is controlled by a central entity. This entity could be a coalition of powerful nations or large corporations. From this perspective, those who control Bitcoin would literally control the global economy. The incentives to form coalitions and take control of the network would be extremely high.\n\nHowever, even after a centralization event, we could expect market mechanisms to constrain the central validator to follow certain standards of behavior. For example, if the central validator becomes censorious or extortionate, Bitcoin would experience a depreciation in its value as users start losing trust and seeking alternatives. It\u2019s simply an application of game theory.\n\nA scalability issue\n\nThe Lightning Network is a second-layer solution for Bitcoin that enables instant and low-cost transactions. It\u2019s important to note that even in the case of hyperbitcoinization, the number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain would remain limited. The number of Lightning channels that can be created or closed is limited by the number of transactions on the blockchain.\n\nFor hyperbitcoinization to occur, the financial system would need to accommodate billions of users by adding additional scalability layers (Layers 2, Layers 3, and so on). At this stage, it\u2019s not clear how this could happen without financial institutions or states issuing digital debt acknowledgments (or even \u201cBitcoin paper\u201d) that are essentially fiat, with the degree of trust that comes with it and the ability to print more than the protocol allows.\n\nHyperbitcoinization and decentralization\n\nUnder the assumption of hyperbitcoinization that retains its decentralization attributes, certain properties would remain in place as they are today:\n\nMining remains decentralized, and no cartel forms to monopolize the network.\n\nMiners select transactions with the highest fee level and do not engage in censorship.\n\nWe could also expect the following:\n\nVolatility is reduced. To become a reliable unit of account, volatility must have decreased in terms of real purchasing power. Otherwise, people wouldn\u2019t use it as a unit of account.\n\nA significant portion of businesses would use it. The network would be well-established and far-reaching.\n\nThe total value would be much greater than today. If everyone uses it all the time, the demand would be incredibly high.\n\nThe total fee market should be significant. If the fee market isn\u2019t much larger, the network would be insecure.\n\nWhy would a state support Bitcoin?\n\nLet\u2019s recap the factors that could rationally motivate a state to adopt Bitcoin:\n\nPolicymakers believe that Bitcoin facilitates trade , perhaps because it offers a superior method for settling commercial transactions with foreign partners. However, in most domestic situations, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t add a significant advantage compared to the local currency.\n\n, perhaps because it offers a superior method for settling commercial transactions with foreign partners. However, in most domestic situations, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t add a significant advantage compared to the local currency. The state seeks to attract businesses or wealthy individuals to foster its economic development.\n\nto foster its economic development. Policymakers believe that the price of Bitcoin will increase significantly and would like the state\u2019s coffers to benefit from this rise. It\u2019s simply a form of speculation, as seen with the position taken by the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. Of course, the downside risk must also be taken into account. Even if it works over a certain period, it\u2019s not the same as building a sustainable growth model.\n\nIt\u2019s simply a form of speculation, as seen with the position taken by the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. Of course, the downside risk must also be taken into account. Even if it works over a certain period, it\u2019s not the same as building a sustainable growth model. The nation lacks a true sovereign currency and is at the mercy of central banks under external control (for example, consider the West African and Central African CFA francs).\n\n(for example, consider the West African and Central African CFA francs). A nation with liberal, democratic, and capitalist principles sees Bitcoin as a subversive means to introduce its anti-state values into the monetary production system.\n\nsees Bitcoin as a subversive means to introduce its anti-state values into the monetary production system. Policymakers are corrupt or selfish, and they might see Bitcoin as a way to enrich themselves. They could synchronize their own purchases or sales to anticipate policy changes that could affect BTC demand. For example, if a nation-state decides to acquire Bitcoin for the treasury, selfish officials could acquire massive amounts in the days preceding the announcement. Corrupt officials could also consider Bitcoin a reliable option for accepting bribes from foreign lobbyists.\n\nWhy would a state reject Bitcoin?\n\nLikewise, several factors could deter states from adopting the Bitcoin protocol:\n\nBitcoin: \u201ca speculative thing\u201d\n\nPolicymakers believe that Bitcoin is little more than a casino-like entity that drains resources from productive economic development. Moreover, it\u2019s an energy-intensive casino at a time of energy transition.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s an casino at a time of Policymakers believe that the speculative cycle could leave behind a trail of toxic debts that would significantly harm the economy. While many stock market crashes are due to herd dynamics, a nation-state should also consider the possibility of an adversary orchestrating a malicious rugpull.\n\nNeutralizing the competition\n\nThe local sovereign currency fights inflation, and the addition of a fixed-supply competitor could exacerbate inflationary pressures. In general, economic policymakers pursue growth policies that maximize real growth and not just protect the value of their currency. However, if the value of the currency declines to the point where inflation hampers economic activity, policymakers would be wise to take measures to combat it. This could backfire. A ban on Bitcoin could be perceived as a desperate attempt to save a failing currency and push more citizens to hold BTC.\n\nPreserving monetary privilege\n\nThe nation-state would prefer economic growth to flow into their own currency rather than sharing wealth with international holders. They see their economy as more productive compared to other national economies. If domestic economic growth occurs within a Bitcoin economy, the network\u2019s purchasing power increases, enriching other parties that may or may not have contributed. Free-rider dynamics are not conducive to protecting one\u2019s own interests.\n\nThey see their economy as more productive compared to other national economies. If domestic economic growth occurs within a Bitcoin economy, the network\u2019s purchasing power increases, enriching other parties that may or may not have contributed. The nation-state benefits from using its own currency as an international reserve (notably the US and their exorbitant privilege, which allows them to borrow without bearing the real cost of such irresponsibility). Encouraging Bitcoin\u2019s growth risks losing this advantage.\n\nHyperbitcoinization is a fascinating concept that raises many questions about the future of our global economy. While the idea of universally accepted uncontrollable currency is appealing, there are still many hurdles to overcome before it becomes a reality. Regardless of what the future holds, even if hyperbitcoinization doesn\u2019t occur, it doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin lacks value. Bitcoin has already proven its worth as a censorship-resistant store of value. It has already changed the way we think about money and finance, and it will likely continue to do so in the years to come.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry has once again captured the attention of investors and financial institutions as Bitcoin (BTC), the leading crypto by market cap, experienced a significant surge in value. In a surprising turn of events, JP Morgan, one of the largest investment banks, has acknowledged Bitcoin\u2019s potential by projecting a price of $45,000.\n\nMoreover, analysts are making bold predictions about Tradecurve (TCRV), a market disruptor currently in its presale phase, foreseeing a staggering 100x increase in value. Let\u2019s take a closer look at why.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nJP Morgan states Bitcoin (BTC) may soar to $45K\n\nAccording to JPMorgan analysts, given that many investors view the two assets as being interchangeable, the price of gold implies that Bitcoin (BTC) should be trading at a significant premium to where it is now trading.\n\nOn May 24th, the experts stated that Bitcoin would trade at about $45,000 in a message to clients. Currently, Bitcoin is trading hands at $26,698.92 with a market cap of $517B, which is a rise of 0.77% in the last 24 hours. This is about 40% less than the Bitcoin level that JP Morgan analysts predicted.\n\nAlso, analysts believe that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will take place next April or May, will also impact its price. This bullish outlook from JP Morgan represents a significant shift in the narrative surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) could see a 100x increase after its launch\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge is grabbing headlines, analysts are turning their attention to Tradecurve , a rising presale star garnering significant interest. These analysts project an astonishing 100x increase in Tradecurve\u2019s value after its launch. Tradecurve, a decentralized trading platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, aims to revolutionize the online trading industry by providing a safe, private, and borderless trading environment.\n\nIts innovative features include a high leverage starting at 500:1, VIP account service, exclusive deposit bonuses, and a copy trading feature where users may subscribe to experienced traders and copy trades that they are doing. Another distinctive feature of Tradecurve that will significantly increase its chances of rivaling already established players such as Binance and Coinbase is that it will offer cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities as trading options on a single account.\n\nMoreover, privacy will be at the forefront of Tradecurve as it eliminates all sign-up KYC checks. Users can just create an account using their email, connect it to a crypto wallet, and make a deposit \u2013 trading in complete anonymity. This fact positions Tradecurve as a vital player in the future of decentralized finance. Many individuals are now looking for privacy and security, which traditional trading platforms such as eToro and Crypto.com overlook.\n\nAt the core of this platform will be its utility token, TCRV, which is now in Stage 3 of its presale and has a value of just $0.015. Holding this token will give users governance voting rights, staking bonuses, and access to VIP levels. Analysts claim that the track record for these kinds of ICOs will give Tradecurve the edge. They point to the Huobi ICO, which began in 2018 for $1.25 but quickly reached its all-time high of $39.81.\n\nAnd given the distinctive features of Tradecurve and the fact that in April 2022, the value of transactions on the world\u2019s foreign exchange markets surpassed $7.5 trillion daily \u2013 the Tradecurve ICO has all the potential to reach the same or greater values as the Huobi ICO did.\n\nBecause of this, analysts predict a 50x increase for TCRV as the presale advances and a 100x rise when it gets listed on a major exchange such as Uniswap after its launch. Follow the links below and purchase this potential blue-chip token for a low price.\n\nFor more information about TCRV presale tokens:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "The first high-level language smart contract on BTC - CoinGeek",
        "content": "This post was first published on Medium.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the first successful smart contract written in a high-level programming language on the BTC network.\n\nThe contract involves two transactions, which can be viewed using a block explorer:\n\nIt is crucial to understand that the entire smart contract logic is enforced at Layer-1 in the form of Bitcoin Script, which is embedded in the witness data.\n\nWe provide a step-by-step guide on how to deploy an sCrypt smart contract on BTC, from compiling to deploying and finally calling it. Also we will elucidate the current limitations of the BTC chain and how they hinder development.\n\nWhat is sCrypt?\n\nsCrypt is a TypeScript framework for writing smart contracts on Bitcoin. It allows developers to program smart contracts directly in TypeScript\u00b9, one of the most popular high-level programming languages known by millions of developers worldwide. An sCrypt smart contract compiles to Script, Bitcoin\u2019s native scripting language, which is then included into a transaction to enforce an arbitrary spending condition. It provides a more developer-friendly abstraction over Script.\n\nsCrypt is originally and primarily designed for Bitcoin SV, but the script it compiles can also be applied on other Bitcoin forks and derived chains, such as BTC, BCH, LiteCoin, or DogeCoin, since they use compatible Bitcoin Script.\n\nThe following is how the most popular smart contract on Bitcoin today, namely Pay to Public Key Hash, is coded in sCrypt.\n\nP2WSH\n\nPay to Witness Script Hash (P2WSH) is a type of locking script in BTC, introduced in the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade. It is similar to a Pay to Script Hash (P2SH), except that it uses SegWit.\n\nHere\u2019s a simplified overview of how P2WSH works:\n\nCreation: A P2WSH UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) is created by sending bitcoins to the hash of a witness or redeem script, as in P2SH. This redeem script is the compiled sCrypt smart contract in our case. Spending: To spend these bitcoins, the spender presents the original redeem script and any required witness (i.e., sCrypt smart contract public method arguments). The Bitcoin network verifies that the provided redeem script matches the hash in the previous output and that the script executes successfully with the given witness.\n\nMulti-party hash puzzles\n\nIn a hash puzzle contract, the spender has to provide a preimage x that hashes to a predefined value y to unlock a UTXO. It can be extended to multiple parties so that multiple preimages have to be provided such that y1 = H(x1), y2 = H(x2), \u2026, yN = H(xN).\n\nThis can be easily coded in sCrypt.\n\nDeploy and Call\n\nFor demonstration purposes, we will deploy a multiparty hash puzzle contract.\n\nWe first compile the contract and create an instance, i.e., initialize it with randomly generated values:\n\nNow we can extract our redeem script:\n\nconsole.log(instance.lockingScript.toHex())\n\nThis will print the serialized script:\n\n0000018257615179547a75537a537a537a0079537a75527a527a7575615279008763537952795279615179517993517a75517a75619c77777777675279518763537952795279949c7777777767006868\n\nNow, let\u2019s broadcast a P2WSH transaction containing the hash of this script. For this we use the Python library bitcoin-utils:\n\nThis will print the serialized and signed P2WSH transaction, something like the following:\n\n02000000000101219a8eb380a72d2b54ebdeca158b0126e7c81e1b84f43d6587556cf3f5e6d5a60000000000ffffffff01435e0400000000002200203463b81678556aea41c76646be324ee16b676331d652dd650c1add2c83e064aa02473044022011f96e5e79905a7cb45a3952dad27df25bb7aa5de0a9d36bd37dcc5d3b0f70ec022055f54335ef75d1a32433c19d47356efc40705c950e80a55924516fa5f5094957012102e53bd683720e9e759ea9b958d3faaeaaeda3345db42ffe77be3db212535f465600000000\n\nWe can broadcast it by simply copying and pasting it to this site, and click \u201cBroadcast transaction.\u201d\n\nOnce broadcast, we can construct the redeeming transaction that will spend our P2WSH output. Again, we use a Python script:\n\nThe most significant part of the script above is when we set the witness data, which contains the right preimages at Line 25\u201327.\n\nAfter running the script we get the raw transaction like this:\n\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\n\nAgain, we can simply broadcast using the same link as before.\n\nVoila! We have successfully deployed and called an sCrypt smart contract on the BTC blockchain.\n\nBTC\u2019s severe limitations\n\nBTC suffers from several grave drawbacks for the development of complex smart contracts, primarily due to its many disabled op-codes and artificially imposed limitations on transaction and script size.\n\nBy contrast, BSV releases the full unconstrained power of Bitcoin smart contracts, by restoring all opcodes and removing all artificial limits. There have been a Cambrian explosion of smart contracts developed, such as Zero-knowledge proof, Turing machines, ZK-Rollup, and Deep Neural Networks. None of this is possible on BTC and other Bitcoin compatible chains.\n\nAs a concrete example, the aforementioned multiparty hash puzzle can be optimized by using the concatenating opcode OP_CAT, which is re-enabled on BSV but still disabled on BTC. Previously, all N hashes have to be included in the locking script, bloating the transaction when N is large. Instead, we can combine all y\u2019s into a single y. For example, when N is 3, we let y = H(H(H(y1) || y2) || y3) , in which || is concatenation. The new optimized contract is as follows:\n\nIn Line 20, concatenation (+) is used, which does not work on BTC.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated how an sCrypt smart contract can run on BTC. Similarly, it can run any Script-compatible chains like BCH, LiteCoin, and DogeCoin. Due to their crippling limits, it runs extremely inferiorly than on BSV, which is the only unbounded and scalable chain to realize sCrypt\u2019s full potential.\n\nThe full code is here.\n\nNOTE:\n\n[1] More precisely, it is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) embedded in TypeScript.\n\nWatch: sCrypt makes smart contracts possible on the BSV blockchain\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Binance Australia selling bitcoin $6k cheaper than other exchanges - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "On Tuesday morning, Binance was selling one bitcoin for about $36,000, while local players BTC Markets, Independent Reserve and Bitpay were selling one bitcoin for about $42,000. The spread has been as wide as $14,000 last Friday, and as much as $9000 on Monday evening.\n\nASIC moves\n\nBinance has faced an increasingly difficult operating environment in Australia this year.\n\nLast month, Binance Australia\u2019s derivatives licence was cancelled by the Australian regulator which had been investigating operations at the Dubai-based exchange.\n\nBinance asked the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to cancel the licence, which the regulator\u2019s chairman, Joe Longo, suggested may have been because ASIC had \u201cfurther engagement planned\u201d.\n\nBinance is also facing legal action brought by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which sued the exchange earlier this year, along with its chief executive Changpeng Zhao, who is largely based in Dubai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe regulator alleges Mr Zhao and another executive were operating an illegal exchange and a sham compliance program. The lawsuit also alleges Binance \u201cwillfully evaded\u201d US law as it solicited American customers for its derivatives business.\n\nBrisbane-based crypto broker Swyftx has long used Binance to facilitate the bulk of its liquidity for its 600,000 customers. But a spokesman said the inability of Binance to facilitate Australian dollar withdrawals would not affect operations at Swyftx.\n\nHe said customers deposited Australian dollars with the broker, which then converted them into US dollars before swapping them for bitcoin using Binance\u2019s international services, not the local one.\n\n\u201cWe were offering an [Australian dollar] onramp before Binance Australia came to the market and that\u2019ll continue,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nLocal crypto exchange Independent Reserve sources its liquidity from its own platform, connecting traders with each other rather than buying assets through a third party.\n\nBinance is fighting regulatory fires around the world. It was forced to discontinue operations in Canada earlier this month after the country issued a series of new guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges including investor limits and mandatory registrations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Binance is the most high-profile exchange, the entire industry has been in the sights of regulators around the world, especially since the collapse of its rival, FTX, in November, which triggered a rout in digital coins.\n\nMore than $1 trillion was wiped from the industry\u2019s market value last year, and legislators and securities regulators are demanding tighter guidelines for disclosures on how the crypto companies operate and hold customer funds."

        "content": "After it opened the week with bulls and bears fighting for domination, Bitcoin (BTC) has started to move in a more positive direction and is about to make a historical golden cross chart pattern, a bullish sign that will likely lead to a significant price gain for the decentralized finance (DeFi) asset in the near future.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin is nearing the first golden cross between the moving averages (MA) on 20 observed time periods and that of the 200 periods, which has never occurred in its history, according to the observations by the cryptocurrency market analyst Moustache, also known as el_crypto_prof on May 30.\n\nBitcoin price trend analysis. Source: el_crypto_prof\n\nGolden vs. death cross\n\nAs the crypto expert further clarified, \u201cat the same time, both bands are serving as support right now,\u201d whereas the death cross in September 2022 had happened right before the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, adding that:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to put the dark times behind us.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, a golden cross refers to a situation when a short-term MA moves above a longer-term MA, typically representing a bullish trading signal. On the other hand, a death cross happens when a short-term MA drops below a longer-term MA, usually suggesting a bearish trading sign.\n\nAt the same time, another pseudonymous crypto trading specialist, Trader Tardigrade, stressed that analysts could divide the macro Bitcoin chart into four phases in each cycle and that the maiden cryptocurrency was at the time of publication \u201cin between Recovery bull phase (Bull 1) and Parabolic bull phase (Bull 2).\u201d\n\nBitcoin macro chart. Source: Trader Tardigrade\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin has reached the price of $27,850, recording a decrease of 0.10% in the last 24 hours, a 1.88% gain across the previous seven days, while losing 4.69% on its monthly chart, as per the latest data retrieved by Finbold on May 30.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nEarlier, crypto expert Ali Martinez noted that Bitcoin had neared the \u2018hope\u2019 stage in the psychology of a market cycle, which indicates a belief that \u2018recovery is possible\u2019 and which preceded the \u2018optimism\u2019 stage in which \u2018this rally is real,\u2019 while whales and sharks continued to accumulate.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
