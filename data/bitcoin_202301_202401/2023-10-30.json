        "content": "Northwestern Engineering\u2019s Dongning Guo was awarded the 2023 Bitcoin Research Prize at the Chaincode Labs Bitcoin Research Day event, held October 27 in New York City.\n\nThe winning paper, \u201cBitcoin's Latency\u2014Security Analysis Made Simple,\u201d published in the Proceedings of the Fourth ACM Conference on Advances in Financial Technologies in September 2022, is coauthored by Ling Ren, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\nGuo is a professor of electrical and computer engineering and (by courtesy) computer science in the McCormick School of Engineering. He is a member of the Communications and Networking (Commnet) Laboratory and the Institute for Data, Econometrics, Algorithms, and Learning (IDEAL).\n\n\u201cFor the past decade, I've been fascinated with Bitcoin and its profound implications on the monetary system, decentralization, and the concept of economic freedom for the masses. Several years ago, I took some risk to pursue this new research area with my PhD student, Jing Li, and later started collaborating with Dr. Ling Ren,\u201d Guo said. \u201cThis prize stands as a deeply gratifying testament to the contribution my co-author, Dr. Ling Ren, and I have made to the field.\u201d\n\nSponsored by Bitcoin research and development center Chaincode Labs, the Bitcoin Research Prize recognizes outstanding research papers \u2014 in domains including cryptography, theoretical computer science, network theory, and economics \u2014 that advance Bitcoin and the Lightning Network payment protocol. An award committee selects the annual winning paper based on its research impact. Eligible papers must be published in a peer-reviewed venue after January 2019.\n\n\u201cThe collaboration with Ling was filled with technical twists and turns and an abundance of enjoyable moments as we overcame one challenge after another,\u201d Guo said. \u201cI consider myself exceptionally fortunate to have had the opportunity to elucidate a fundamental property of Bitcoin and the underlying Nakamoto consensus protocol through the elegance of a theorem.\u201d\n\nGuo explained that, by design, the decentralized Bitcoin mining network allows users to join or leave at any time. Incentivized by mining rewards, honest miners run protocols to validate the transaction information in a blockchain block. Each transaction is approved or rejected by the network via consensus mechanisms.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual for the ledger to fork into competing blockchains that disagree about recent transactions, but the deeper a transaction is in a longest blockchain, the more likely that all honest miners reach consensus about it,\u201d Guo said.\n\nGuo and Ren\u2019s paper resolved a fundamental latency-security trade-off by providing a pair of closed-form formulas to upper- and lower-bound the safety of a transaction as a function of the confirmation depth, the mining rates, and a network delay parameter.\n\nAt the Bitcoin Research Day event, Guo introduced a follow-up result that further tightens the upper and lower bounds. He is currently working with a graduate student on the question of whether the gap between the bounds can be eliminated.\n\n\u201cWe aim to pin down exactly what is the worst possible attack to Bitcoin and similar systems,\u201d Guo said."

        "content": "The price of bitcoin could rise to $150,000 by 2025, Bernstein said Tuesday in a note citing optimism about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nBernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said the firm expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a bitcoin ETF by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe bullish estimate is about five times the current price of around $34,000 and more than double bitcoin's all-time high of more than $67,000 set in November 2021.\n\nBernstein also expects that ETF approval would shift up to 10% of bitcoin's circulating supply toward ETFs. The approval would allow conventional investors to get bitcoin exposure directly from their investment portfolios. The only similar product is Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust , or GBTC, which presently holds around 3% of outstanding bitcoin, according to the note.\n\n\"You may not like Bitcoin as much as we do, but a dispassionate view of Bitcoin as a commodity, suggests a turn of the cycle,\" Chhugani wrote. \"A good idea is only as good as its timing - SEC approved ETFs by world's top asset managers (BlackRock, Fidelity et al), seems imminent.\"\n\nThe prediction came in a note where Chhugani initiated coverage on several bitcoin mining firms, saying that the bitcoin \"halving\" in April 2024 \u2014 in which bitcoin rewards will be halved as part of a planned and recurring event baked into the currency's underlying code \u2014 will force \"losing miners\" to be \"washed out,\" paving the way for big gains by the survivors.\n\nLast week, the price of bitcoin reached $35,000, its highest level since May 2022. Investors have said they remain hopeful for a green light on the ETF by the end of the year after the SEC declined to appeal a key court ruling in Grayscale's lawsuit against it.\n\nHowever, the court ruling does not guarantee the SEC will approve a bitcoin ETF. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long criticized the crypto industry as being rife with \"fraudsters and scam artists,\" so whether the regulator will continue to fight against crypto ETFs is an open question.\n\nThe crypto industry has faced recent struggles, including the SEC's lawsuit against Binance for securities violations earlier this year. Last year, crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is currently on trial for fraud.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these CNBC PRO stories:"

        "content": "Bitcoin miners are making the world even worse.\n\nNew Book Tuesday is the best day of the week Chez Auffhammer. Especially when there is a new Michael Lewis release in the pile. Going Infinite describes the rise and fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of Alameda Research and the Crypto exchange FTX. Lewis got unprecedented access to Bankman-Fried and in nail-biting fashion describes one of the bigger implosions in finance history. I complained about crypto in 2018, but had sort of lost interest. Severin had pondered grid stability and crypto mining in another post. But this book made me wonder how the ole mining business is doing.\n\nGPUs are amazing things. They are gadgets that allow you to do massive amounts of computations in parallel, but they consume an enormous amount of power and generate significant heat! I moved mine into a refrigerated basement across campus, as my office resembled a sauna. And no, I am not mining crypto. I am using these gadgets to figure out climate impacts.\n\nSo in my recent reading journey across the nerdverse, I came across a piece by Anna Papp, Doug Almond and Shuang Zhang called \u201cBitcoin and Carbon Dioxide Emissions: Evidence from Daily Production Decisions\u201d. The first thing I learned is that the US overtook China in 2021 as the number one location for cryptomining, since China banned mining for crypto. Some US states even went as far as providing significant incentives for miners to locate within their borders, which reminds of an older literature on jurisdictional competition. You might think that this is a good thing, as on average, the grid here is cleaner than in China.\n\nTurns out things are trickier than they appear. What really matters is how much actual mining is done and how the electricity used to mine is generated. You might think that these miners just buy from the grid, so we should think about this issue the same way we think about plugging in an EV and contemplating which type of power is at the margin.\n\nThe paper shows a worrying case study of the Scrubgrass Power plant in Kennerdell, Pennsylvania. This is the type of plant you want to phase out if you care about mother earth. It burns waste coal and is relatively inefficient. It\u2019s a literal dumpster fire. It was on its way to be phased out (yay) until a cryptominer bought it and moved in their GPUs. Yes, you read that right. This is a power plant that generates electricity and mines crypto on site. In the alternate crypto free universe, this power plant would have been mothballed.\n\nSo is this bad? This is where the paper gets interesting. The cryptobros have all kinds of delusional stories about why this currency is making the world a better place. This paper is a pretty powerful counterexample. What they do is look at the price of crypto, which we observe, and look at what happens to the emissions at Scrubgrass. They have thousands of price movements and observe emissions (since the plant has Continuous Emissions Monitoring System, CEMS). These serious scholars think carefully through issues that might confound the effect of price on emissions and I am convinced by what they find.\n\nAre you ready? They find a long-run price elasticity of 0.33-0.40 and a bigger short-run elasticity of 0.69-0.71. What does that mean Max? If you take the most recent estimate of the social cost of carbon of $190 a ton, this implies that a $1 increase in daily Bitcoin price leads to an additional $3.11-$6.79 worth of daily damages from carbon emissions at Scrubgrass. Year to date the price of Bitcoin has gone up almost $20,000, so their results imply large emissions increases.\n\nDo I really need to point out that this is really dumb and something that should not be allowed to happen? Miners are creating value which they get to deposit in their bank accounts, while the rest of us pay $3-6 for each dollar they make. This is \u201cI literally spit out my coffee when I read that abstract\u201d stupid. So what do we do?\n\nTwo things. Price carbon. Globally. Not gonna happen just yet (although I am curious what will happen when the Trump tax cuts expire), or follow China in banning the mining of crypto domestically. If we don\u2019t like bans, at least prevent these firms from buying old dirty power plants. If the estimates from this paper are right, then it might make sense to buy these out using public funds and mothball them. That would sure beat turning them into carbon mines. And along the way, it might help discourage scaling up cryptononsense.\n\nKeep up with Energy Institute blogs, research, and events on X @energyathaas\n\nSuggested citation: Auffhammer, Maximilian, \u201cSaving Coal \u2013 One Bitcoin at a Time\u201d, Energy Institute Blog, UC Berkeley, October 30, 2023, https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2023/10/30/saving-coal-one-bitcoin-at-a-time/"

        "title": "Where is the bitcoin ATM market headed? | Commentary - Kiosk Marketplace",
        "content": "What's driving the bitcoin ATM market? There are several factors to consider including security and accessibility. However, there are also issues holding it back. Let's take a look at both.\n\n(Editor's note: An earlier version of this article ran on ATM Marketplace, a sister publication of Automation & Self-Service, Kiosk Marketplace and Vending Times.)\n\nBitcoin ATMs have quickly become a ubiquitous staple in many retail spaces. You can find them in places ranging from gas stations to supermarkets. In fact, there are now more than 37,000 machines in operation worldwide, according to CoinATMRadar.\n\nThere are multiple factors driving this growth, including accessibility.\n\n\"Bitcoin ATMs are still a popular investing avenue for consumers because they offer accessibility in an industry that otherwise still has high barriers to entry,\" Gabriella Kusz, CEO of the Global Digital Asset and Cryptocurrency Association, said in an email interview. \"As more people become interested in buying crypto with cash, the easy-to-use, familiar technology allows consumers to securely expand and diversify their portfolio. Bitcoin ATMs offer a safe alternative to buying cryptocurrency, taking various steps to mitigate fraud risk and implement safeguards for investors. As the demand for bitcoin ATMs continues to grow, we will likely continue to see them placed everywhere from bustling cities to quiet suburbs.\"\n\nRetailer benefits\n\nBitcoin ATMs are also easier to use on the retailer's side as well, while also providing a profit.\n\n\"The regulatory environment for cryptocurrency varies from country to country, but in many places, there are few restrictions on bitcoin ATMs. This has made it easier for operators to set up new machines and expand their networks,\" Mark Fidelman, founder of SmartBlocks, said in an email interview. \"Bitcoin ATMs can be a profitable business for operators, as they often charge a percentage fee on transactions. As more people use bitcoin ATMs, the potential for profits increases, which can encourage more investment in the market.\"\n\nThe security side is also important as users can more easily make transactions on bitcoin ATMs and ensure the cryptocurrency stays on their own wallets, rather than having to go through an online exchange.\n\n\"Some people prefer to use bitcoin ATMs for the privacy they offer. Unlike some online exchanges, bitcoin ATMs do not require users to provide personal information, which can be appealing to those who want to keep their transactions anonymous,\" Fidelman said.\n\nChallenges remain\n\nHowever, there are also some issues within the bitcoin ATM industry. For one, the growth of bitcoin ATMs has slowed down significantly \u2014 in some cases many bitcoin ATMs have been removed. On Feb. 28, for example, there was a net reduction of 1,061 bitcoin ATMs. In addition, the speed of installations has dropped, currently sitting at around three deployed per day, according to CoinATMRadar.\n\nThere have been several suggestions as to why the market is being held back. One is that despite it being simpler than some cryptocurrency companies, there is still a lack of regulatory clarity.\n\n\"While the regulatory environment for cryptocurrency is generally becoming more favorable, there is still a lack of clarity in some jurisdictions regarding the legality and regulation of bitcoin ATMs. This can create uncertainty for operators and potential users of the machines,\" Fidelman said.\n\nOne example of this is the recent push by the Financial Conduct Authority of the U.K. to crack down on unregistered crypto ATMs. The authority is claiming cryptocurrency ATMs in the country are not registered, which can lead to money laundering. In the U.K., all cryptocurrency companies must register with the FCA.\n\nFidelman said other factors holding back the industry include limited acceptance of cryptocurrency, high transaction fees and security concerns.\n\nBankruptcy raises concern\n\nThere is also the issue of a major bankruptcy in the industry. Recently, Cash Cloud, an operator of Coin Cloud ATMs, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada. The company was in debt for an amount between $100 million and $500 million.\n\n\"The recent bankruptcy of Coin Cloud, a bitcoin ATM operator, has raised concerns about the overall health of the bitcoin ATM industry. Some industry experts suggest that the bankruptcy of Coin Cloud may be an indicator of a larger issue in the bitcoin ATM market,\" Fidelman said.\n\n\"The industry is relatively new and rapidly evolving, with many operators lacking the experience, financial backing, or business acumen needed to succeed in a competitive market. Furthermore, the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrency is often uncertain, presenting challenges to bitcoin ATM operators. However, despite the challenges, the bitcoin ATM market has continued to grow in recent years, with an increasing number of machines being deployed worldwide, and more people using them to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Thus, while the bankruptcy of Coin Cloud has raised concerns, some analysts view it as an isolated incident, rather than a reflection of broader issues in the industry.\"\n\nEducation needed\n\nLastly, a major issue that needs to be addressed is educating the public on cryptocurrency. While it has become more mainstream, many businesses are unaware of the benefits of deploying a bitcoin ATM.\n\n\"Despite industry shakeups, investors are still interested in crypto but often don't know where to start,\" Kusz said. \"Even though bitcoin ATMs employ simple to use technology, companies still need to offer guidance and education within the crypto space to ensure that new investors are making educated decisions that align with their financial goals. In providing two-way communication and trustworthy customer support, companies can encourage return customers and increase participation in the DeFi community.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin white paper turns 15 years old - Blockworks",
        "content": "Fifteen years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 whose true identity remains a mystery \u2014 published their seminal white paper titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d\n\nSpanning just nine pages, this document offered up a blueprint that reimagined the way we perceive and transfer value in a digital age. It delved into the intricacies of cryptographic hashing, the architecture of blocks and the timing mechanisms that would be used to sustain them.\n\nOne of the white paper\u2019s main innovations was its proposed proof-of-work system. While not Satoshi\u2019s invention, its application in the context of a decentralized cryptocurrency was novel. Building upon ideas like Adam Back\u2019s \u201cHashcash,\u201d the author adapted the preexisting proof-of-work concept in order to address the double-spending problem. This ensured that every transaction on the network was verified through consensus, without relying on a central authority.\n\n\u201cOnce the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it,\u201d Nakamoto wrote in the whitepaper.\n\nRead more: Proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake: Which is better?\n\nThe CEO of Luxor, a firm that provides firmware for bitcoin mining machines and a hashrate derivatives trading platform, called what Nakamoto envisioned \u201cmagical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin blockchain is somewhat magical in that it grows stronger as time goes on\u2026which is somewhat against the laws of the universe. As things get older, generally they degrade and break down,\u201d Nick Hansen told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cI think Satoshi probably envisioned that,\u201d Hansen added.\n\nAt present, the bitcoin blockchain has surpassed 522 GB in size, essentially making any attempt at tampering with the distributed ledger a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nHansen said he thinks Nakamoto likely also saw a future where institutions and large companies would be the ones dominating the effort to mine bitcoin, especially as the network grew larger and the computational need grew with it.\n\n\u201cSince Satoshi early on did design this to be a global payment rail, I think it would be foolish to assume that the mining portion of that ecosystem [wouldn\u2019t] probably need to be done by massive institutional grade companies,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cI would say that yes, he probably figured that bitcoin mining would become a massive commodity business.\u201d\n\nNakamoto drew a parallel to gold mining in the \u201cincentive\u201d section of the whitepaper, which detailed how bitcoins would initially circulate. Essentially, \u201cmining\u201d refers to the process of verifying transactions on the network.\n\n\u201cThe steady addition of a constant of [sic] amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended,\u201d Nakamoto wrote.\n\nWhat Nakamoto may or may not have envisioned was how bitcoin could be used to aid those suffering under the reign of dictators.\n\nThe Human Rights Foundation (HRF), a nonprofit championing human rights, views bitcoin as a pivotal weapon against despotism. Its decentralized nature allows those under autocratic regimes to transact outside the confines of government-controlled fiat currency.\n\nFurther championing this cause, the HRF\u2019s Bitcoin Development Fund extends grants to innovators working to improve the bitcoin network. One notable beneficiary was the developer behind lnp2pBot, an initiative that bolsters privacy by enabling users to exchange dollars for bitcoin without the need for KYC (know your customer) identification.\n\nThe HRF\u2019s chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein told Blockworks he\u2019s \u201cmuch more bullish\u201d on bitcoin these days because of how much easier it is to use it since 2013, when the HRF first started working with bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe apps are better, they have better UX,\u201d Gladstein said. \u201cWe have the Lightning Network, which we didn\u2019t have then, so we don\u2019t have to wait around 10 minutes for confirmation and you can send bitcoin (BTC) instantly. We have much better privacy tools than we used to have back then, which is really important for activists.\u201d\n\nGladstein also noted Nakamoto\u2019s curious choice to release the bitcoin whitepaper on Oct. 31. That was the same date Martin Luther nailed his revolutionary 95 theses to a church\u2019s door in protest of Catholicism over 500 years ago.\n\nLuther\u2019s arguments against the church had the first whisperings of the concept of separating religion from the state, whereas the bitcoin white paper argued for the separation of money from the state, Gladstein said.\n\nAnother explanation for the publication date could be that Halloween is quite befitting for someone who later became the most famous masked anonymous figure in all of crypto.\n\nOr, the specific date of Oct. 31 may not have been chosen for any particular reason other than perhaps being timed right around some of the worst declines in the traditional stock market in history.\n\nEither way, Nakamoto\u2019s thoughts, motives and intentions will likely be fertile ground for speculation for years to come.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe collapse of cryptocurrency exchange giant FTX marked the depths of the crypto downturn. Yet the ensuing trial of founder Sam Bankman-Fried, accused of defrauding customers, has not dragged crypto prices down further. Despite negative publicity, the price of bitcoin has doubled in the past year.\n\nThis has been attributed to two things. In early 2024, rewards for bitcoin miners are expected to drop by 50 per cent. The result is a tightening of supply that could lift prices. At the same time, the US could be on the cusp of regulatory action that confers new legitimacy on to digital assets.\n\nNext year, bitcoin buyers expect the US Securities and Exchange Commission to give BlackRock and other financial companies permission to launch exchange traded funds that invest directly in bitcoin. This, they believe, could spur more adoption by institutional investors and act as a challenge to nefarious, unregulated crypto platforms.\n\nBoth assumptions are wrong, even if the SEC grits its teeth and grants approval. ETFs may be more appealing than setting up wallets and buying tokens directly from unregulated exchanges, but their existence does not eliminate scams and volatility that investors find off-putting. When ProShares launched the first ETF that tracked contracts speculating on the future price of bitcoin in late 2021, bitcoin prices rose. The ETF finished its first day of trading at close to $42. It now trades at $17.50.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap has fallen from a $3tn market cap to about $1.3tn. Elon Musk, an outspoken supporter of digital assets, has not opted to expose his electric car company Tesla to further price swings. Tesla invested $1.5bn in bitcoin in early 2021 to \u201cmaximise returns on our cash\u201d. At the last count, its digital assets were just $184mn.\n\nLiquidity is in short supply. Remaining platforms are under pressure from regulators. Trading volumes at Coinbase, the largest US digital asset platform, fell 55 per cent in the first six months of the year. Without a supply of new money, the latest price rally is unsustainable."

        "title": "Bitcoin: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Over the past seven days, Bitcoin (BTC -3.16%) is up a head-spinning 20%, making it one of the best weeks for the world's most popular cryptocurrency in nearly two years. And, as might be expected, that sizzling recent performance has energized the Bitcoin bulls, who are now predicting that it could be on one of its historic runs as we head into 2024.\n\nAnd that's exactly what has me so concerned. The market could be overheating, pulling in a lot of unsuspecting investors who are hoping to make a quick profit from a rapid price appreciation in the token. As Warren Buffett once remarked, \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy only when others are fearful.\" Of course, Buffett (who famously does not invest in Bitcoin) was talking about stock, not cryptocurrencies, when he made that comment, but it's a useful way to think about what's happening right now with Bitcoin.\n\nPay attention to the Fear & Greed Index\n\nWarren Buffett's insight into investor psychology and market sentiment is why I'm keeping a careful eye on Bitcoin's Fear & Greed Index, which suddenly shifted into \"greed\" territory this week. In fact, the Fear & Greed Index is at its highest greed level since Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $69,000 back in November 2021. Back then, Bitcoin was hitting stratospheric new highs every day, and investors were convinced that the upward trajectory would continue forever. But if you were tracking the Fear & Greed Index, then you knew that there were obvious warning signs, and that the chances for a crypto market correction were increasing.\n\nThe Fear & Greed index is one of my favorite tools for gauging sentiment in the crypto market, primarily because it is so easy to track and understand. There are several different versions of this index, but the one that I use can be found displayed at the top of the homepage of CoinMarketCap. That Fear & Greed index ranges from 0 to 100. The closer the index is to zero, the more likely there is \"extreme fear\" in the market, and the closer the index is to 100, the more likely that there is \"extreme greed\" in the market. Right now, the index stands at 72, which is right at the boundary of \"greed\" and \"extreme greed.\"\n\nFinding value in the crypto market\n\nOf course, the Fear & Greed Index can't tell you whether or not to buy a certain cryptocurrency. It only offers an insight into the broad state of crypto investor psychology at a certain point in time. The more fear there is in the marketplace, the greater the chance that inventors will be dumping every token they own, which can lead to some bargain investment opportunities. The more greed there is in the marketplace, the greater the chance that investors are irrationally bidding up certain cryptocurrencies, increasing the chances for a market correction.\n\nIf used properly, the Fear & Greed Index can be a useful tool for determining if cryptocurrencies are undervalued or overvalued at any point in time. However, as Buffett suggested with his comment, this requires a certain amount of contrarian thinking. The knee-jerk reaction, of course, is to buy as much Bitcoin as you can if the price of Bitcoin is going up. However, the fact that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index was in the mid 50s a week ago and has suddenly surged up into the low 70s could be a warning signal that those buying today are overpaying for Bitcoin. In other words, the price of Bitcoin could be overheating.\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin?\n\nOne way to take fear and greed out of the investment equation is by adopting a strategy such as dollar-cost averaging, which is a commitment to buy fixed dollar amounts of an asset on a recurring schedule, regardless of the price of that asset. Thus, for example, you might commit to buying $50 of Bitcoin each week, regardless of whether its price is going up or going down. This prevents you from becoming too fearful or too greedy.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, you should only buy Bitcoin if you believe that its long-term growth prospects justify a very high valuation. If you are only buying Bitcoin because everyone else is buying Bitcoin, then you are probably doing it all wrong. Remember: The goal is to buy low and sell high. If you are getting too greedy, you might end up buying high and selling low."

It's just like we don't use gold as an asset class for our clients,\" he said. \"It's not that people can't invest in there. We just look at asset classes or, you know, what belongs in a long-term portfolio, what has intrinsic value, has cash flows to it? And those are the asset classes we steer people towards. And so we don't go towards bitcoin or gold or any other of those stable assets.\"\n\nA spokesman later told Insider that Vanguard views the investment case for cryptocurrencies as weak.\n\n\"Unlike stocks and bonds, most cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic economic value and generate no cash flows, such as interest payments or dividends,\" he said. \"Further, cryptocurrencies have proven to be highly volatile, which runs counter to Vanguard's goal to generate positive real returns to investors over time.\"\n\nCurrently, BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF application remains under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the regulator allows bitcoin futures ETFs, it has been largely critical of the cryptocurrency sphere, and has previously denied such applications.\n\nBut in August, Grayscale Investments won its court case against the SEC, which had earlier rejected an application to turn its over-the-counter traded bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe court decision raised hopes that the regulatory obstacles would be cleared, allowing for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF soon.\n\nMeanwhile, enthusiasm for a potential spot bitcoin ETF continues to grow on Wall Street. Earlier this month, crypto-bull Mike Novogratz told CNBC that it would make zero sense for an ETF to be blocked.\n\nMarkets are also demonstrating a readiness, and inflows into digital asset funds have jumped to their highest weekly level since July 2022.\n\nAccording to the latest Coin Shares report, digital asset investment inflows hit $326 million for the week, with bitcoin making up 90%.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "The U.S. government on Friday published an application by crypto giant Grayscale to launch an Ethereum ETF for the spot market. Grayscale first applied for the ETF in early October, but the petition\u2019s appearance on the Federal Reserve is significant because it starts a 240-day clock by which the Securities and Exchange Commission must respond.\n\nThe start of the Ethereum ETF process also coincides with a surge in crypto prices this month that analysts believe is correlated to impending decisions by the SEC on a batch of Bitcoin ETF applications by Grayscale, BlackRock, and others.\n\nSince the start of October, Bitcoin prices have jumped around 27% while Ethereum has climbed 7%.\n\nMany in the crypto industry believe the approval of ETF products, which make it easy for retail investors to buy various assets in the form of shares, will result in a flood of new liquidity into the markets.\n\nWhile Grayscale has sought to launch a Bitcoin ETF for years, the SEC has rebuffed these efforts, leading the company to sue the agency last year. In late August, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a unanimous and resounding decision that opened the door to widespread expectations that the SEC would issue an approval soon.\n\nMany industry watchers have circled early January for when the SEC is likely to grant approval, in part because that will coincide with another \u201cshot clock\u201d deadline for a Bitcoin ETF application by the crypto hedge fund Ark Invest.\n\nWhile Ark is currently at the head of the approval queue, it remains to be seen if the SEC will approve its application first or instead approve a larger batch of applicants all at once. It\u2019s also possible, though unlikely, the agency will find a new pretext to delay or not approve the Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nThe process has been slow and convoluted in part because it involves a two-part approval\u2014one to permit exchanges to list crypto ETFs, and a separate one for individual companies to issue the ETFs.\n\nIn a quirk of the regulatory process, the SEC has approved futures ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. While these are also crypto ETFs, the underlying assets they contain are not digital assets but instead futures contracts that are well understood only by investors well-versed in derivatives.\n\nIn response to a request for comment about the ETF application, a company spokeswoman said: \u201cThe filing reflects Grayscale\u2019s ongoing commitment to converting its entire family of crypto investment products to ETFs.\u201d"

This happens every four years, with the next halving set for April 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs halving essentially cuts down on bitcoin supply, crypto miners are less likely to sell accumulated tokens, because they anticipate higher future prices. Already, 70% of bitcoin tokens have not sold in the last 12 months, Bernstein pointed out.\n\nAt the same time, the currency is undergoing increased demand from new buyers, especially with the Securities and Exchange Commission expected to approve spot bitcoin ETFs soon.\n\nThough the SEC originally tried to block such efforts, its rejection of a Grayscale crypto ETF was defeated in court in August, potentially paving the way for a regulatory turnabout.\n\n\"We expect US regulated ETFs to be the watershed moment for crypto and we expect a SEC approval by late 2023/Q1, 2024,\" Chhugani wrote. \"Post halving, we expect the bitcoin spot demand via ETFs to outstrip miner selling by 6-7 times at peak. We expect bitcoin ETFs to be equivalent to 9-10% of spot bitcoin in circulation by 2028.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalysts expect bitcoin to rally into the ETF approvals and the initial post-approval response, followed by some profit-taking going into halving, then a \"major inflection\" after halving.\n\nHalving will also have implications on the crypto mining industry, leading to more consolidation. As the amount of rewarded tokens drops, high-cost miners will face the most pressure, and the least efficient of them will likely not survive, leading to consolidation.\n\nInstead, Chhugani points investors towards two miners worth paying attention to: Riot and CleanSpark.\n\nCalling them a \"high-beta way to gain exposure,\" the note cited their low power cost in mining tokens, high liquidity, and unlevered balance sheets. Both were given outperform ratings."

        "title": "Worst Kind of Mining for the Environment? It Might Be Bitcoin. - DISCOVER Magazine",
        "content": "Mining resources from our planet can take a devastating toll on the environment, both local and global. Even beyond this, using the resource could cause disastrous effects to our planet and dependence on a single resource can wreak havoc on a country's economy. Yet, many of these resources are needed for our daily life -- sometimes as a luxury, sometimes as a necessity. Any responsible country or company should always take pause to consider what impact mining of any kind can have on the planet.\n\nIt turns out that these days, one type of mining might be the worst for Earth's environment: bitcoins. Yes, the \"mining\" of virtual currency makes its mark on the our planet. The unequal distribution of Bitcoin mining across the globe means that some countries are making a much large dent into the planet's climate and environment than others ... all for a \"resource\" that is far from necessary for our society.\n\nBitcoin mining using a lot of computing power to solve the crypographic puzzles that lie at the heart of the industry. As of today (October 30, 2023), each Bitcoin is worth over $34,000 and with the multitude of other cryptocoins out there, using computers to unlock more can be a profitable endeavor. Almost half a trillion dollars of the global economy runs on these \"virtual currencies\".\n\nWhat is the Environmental Impact of Bitcoin Mining?\n\nRarely do people who mine Bitcoins stop to ponder the environmental impact of their \"extraction.\" A new study by Sanaz Chamanara and others in Earth's Future, a journal from the American Geophysical Union, lays out some of the startling numbers that come from Bitcoin mining.\n\nHere are some of the most eye-popping:\n\nIn 2020-21, Bitcoin mining consumed more electrical power than the country of Pakistan (population: 230 million).\n\nThe sources of this electrical power released over 85 megatons of carbon dioxide. That's the same as 190 natural gas power plants or ~5 Yellowstone calderas. This is based on the actual carbon dioxide emitted by the different styles of generation, so this isn't a maximum value.\n\nIf your power comes from hydropower, the loss of water from evaporation and other means led to Bitcoin mining consuming 1.65 cubic kilometers of fresh water. That's more than the domestic water use of over 330 million people in the rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf your power comes from biofuels, it takes almost 1,900 square kilometers of land to produce the source crops. That's the bigger than the state of Rhode Island.\n\nThe biggest culprit for energy use for Bitcoin mining are not shocking: China and the United States. However, some of the other top ten power users are more of a surprise to many people: Kazakhstan, Russia, Malaysia, Iran, Ireland, Singapore. This means that 45% of all the power used to mine Bitcoins comes from the worst carbon dioxide emitted for energy generation, coal.\n\nIn many ways, the race for Bitcoin mining superiority has caused some countries to head directly towards calamity. Iran, a country already strapped for water, used over 19 million cubic meters of water for Bitcoin mining in 2020-21. That's nearly 20% of the country's domestic water use per year (in 2021), all going to energy production for Bitcoins.\n\nAs the price of Bitcoins rise, so does the power people use to mine it. As Chamanara and others point out, when Bitcoin prices spiked 400% in 2021, electric usage from Bitcoin mining also spiked 140%. If you live somewhere with an already-taxed electrical grid, this sort of change could easily use that grid over the edge.\n\nIs Bitcoin Mining Worth the Cost?\n\nWho exactly benefits from Bitcoin mining is unclear. Although corporations, banks and even some countries profess a desire to expand the use of Bitcoins and related virtual currencies, so far there is little evidence that they have looked at how amassing and exchanging these coins will impact the environment. Add on the impact that continuing (and growing) carbon dioxide emissions and water use of populations and our climate, you wonder why Bitcoin mining is allowed at all.\n\nThat is what is really boils down to: how much do we value our planet's climate and environment over amassing personal or corporate wealth? So many sectors of our economy have been trying to move to modes that are much less destructive, yet the emerging cryptocurrency markets are doing just the opposite. Instead, they have been exploiting the planet's resources no differently than putting a massive open pit mine in a National Forest or drilling for even more oil on the North Slope of Alaska.\n\nIt is up to the world's governments to decide if regulating Bitcoins like it regulates all traditional mining is needed. You can't just go and open your own mine in many countries without permission and an assessment of the impact that mine will have. It might be high time for the same guard rails be installed in the realm of Bitcoins."

        "title": "County commission OKs Bitcoin lawsuit settlement - WJHL-TV News Channel 11",
        "content": "JONESBOROUGH, Tenn. (WJHL) \u2014 A controversial Bitcoin mine in Limestone must shut down by March 2026 after Washington County commissioners approved a proposed lawsuit settlement in a called meeting Monday.\n\n\u201cKnowing that it would come to an end would make us feel much better,\u201d Preston Holley, who lives across from the facility that opened in early 2021, told commissioners before they voted 13-2 in favor of the deal. Holley was one of five citizens who spoke during a public comment period and more than 40 who turned out for the meeting.\n\nHolley said the operation was brought to the community without their knowledge. He said it has affected many people living around the facility.\n\n\u201cFor myself and the neighbors around me, being at our own home has been changed tremendously,\u201d Holley said. \u201cYou don\u2019t go outside and hear the same things and see the same things that we looked for when we all built our homes out in the country in this beautiful place.\n\nOther people have had you know, loss of property value. They\u2019ve had real estate transactions to go bad as a result of this. And, you know, it definitely changed the way we live out in Limestone.\u201d\n\nThe Red Dog facility would close down even earlier if the company finds another location and starts operation there. According to Washington County zoning rules, no zoning districts currently allow cryptocurrency mining, so any local relocation would likely have to be in either Johnson City or Jonesborough.\n\nThe settlement also levies monetary fines against Red Dog and BrightRidge, the local utility that leases land and sells power to Red Dog and that was the initial defendant.\n\n\u201cTo set a date, not in the timeframe that we want them out because I would like to have seen them out yesterday or the day before or the day before, but this is an opportunity,\u201d Commissioner Josh Edens said before joining the 12 other commissioners who voted yes. \u201cNot the way we want it, but to see them out with a hard stop date that is enforceable by contract.\u201d\n\nThe settlement, already approved by BrightRidge and Red Dog\u2019s leadership, will now to go Washington County Chancery Court Judge John Rambo for approval.\n\nMayor Joe Grandy said the March 2026 date coincides with Red Dog\u2019s contract agreement with the TVA and BrightRidge.\n\n\u201cIt probably seems like a long time, but you got to realize they\u2019ve been operating out there for three years,\u201d Grandy said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re more than halfway through the contract period already. So this agreement will give a date certain at a maximum time that they will be shut down.\u201d\n\nHow we got here\n\nBrightRidge leased Red Dog property next to its substation on Bailey Bridge Road in the pastoral New Salem community in late 2020 after getting the property rezoned to A-3 (agriculture business) in February 2020. BrightRidge told county commissioners at that time it planned a \u201cblockchain data center\u201d but made no mention of another business or of a Bitcoin mine.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any doubt about how or why we got here it\u2019s because of BrightRidge,\u201d Commissioner Freddie Malone said while commissioners discussed whether to accept the deal.\n\nCommissioner Marty Johnson (right) represents the district where the facility is and was one of two commissioners voting no. (Photo: WJHL)\n\nNeighbors began complaining of incessant loud noise at the site in May 2021, several months after Red Dog brought the mine to full capacity with $10 million of computer equipment that can use up to 25 megawatts of power. Red Dog is BrightRidge\u2019s largest customer.\n\nShortly after, commissioners learned Washington County\u2019s zoning administrator and attorney said the use didn\u2019t meet guidelines. The noise comes from high-powered fans used to cool the \u201cmine\u2019s\u201d computers, which perform complex equations in a race to \u201cunearth\u201d new coins of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\nThey told BrightRidge to shut the mine down in September 2021. BrightRidge refused and said the county\u2019s issue was with Red Dog. Red Dog said they were simply operating under the terms of their lease with BrightRidge, which had gotten the rezoning in the first place.\n\nThe county sued BrightRidge in November 2021, claiming the Bailey Bridge Road site violated zoning rules and had been constructed without a permit. In June 2022, the county commission approved a settlement agreement that would have allowed Red Dog to build a new mine at the Washington County Industrial Park in Telford.\n\nCommissioners Larry England, Freddie Malone, and Suzy Williams. (Photo: WJHL)\n\nThat decision drew a backlash in a new community, and after seven new commissioners came on post-election last fall, they voted to back out of the still unfinalized settlement. Early this year, Washington County Chancellor John Rambo set a February 2024 trial date.\n\nSeveral commissioners expressed their dissatisfaction with some details of the proposal, including how long it allows Red Dog to operate \u2014 and BrightRidge to sell it massive amounts of electricity. But Jeff Ward, the attorney who has joined Washington County Attorney Allyson Wilkinson in representing the county, said additional costs were about to kick in as the case entered a new phase of document filings and pre-trial work.\n\nHe and Wilkinson also noted the possibility the county could lose the suit, despite Rambo already having ruled the operation did violate zoning rules \u2014 and they said if the county won, appeals would likely make it at least 2025 before the mine could conceivably shut down. That would be after substantial additional legal fees to the county.\n\nA number of commissioners registered their complaints about the length of time before Red Dog would have to shut down, and several questioned how enforceable the agreement would be. Ward said the fact that it would be viewed as a contract would make a judge likely to file an injunction to shut down the mine if Red Dog violated the terms.\n\n\u201cThe proposal being provided to you tonight is basically a take-it-or-leave-it proposal,\u201d Ward said.\n\n\u201cI know everybody would like to have more time, I know the citizens would like to have more time.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Jim Wheeler made a motion to approve, saying \u201cI think we have an opportunity here to settle this with a firm date and we have as much opportunity to enforce this as we do any other outcome I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nAttorney Jeff Ward addresses commissioners. (Photo: WJHL)\n\nSettlement details\n\nIn addition to a contractual guarantee the Limestone operation would shut down no later than March 2026, the proposal carries several costs for both Red Dog and BrightRidge.\n\nThe first would come within 30 days of Rambo entering an order dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice (meaning it couldn\u2019t be refiled). By that point, Washington County would receive a lump sum payment of $25,000, with half the money coming from Red Dog and half from BrightRidge.\n\nAdditionally, Washington County would collect $200 a day, payable the fifth of each month, for as long as the mine continues operating at its Bailey Bridge Road location \u2014 again with half the money coming from BrightRidge and half from Red Dog.\n\nIf the settlement were finalized quickly in court and the mine stayed open until the deadline, those penalties would total right around $100,000.\n\nThe 51 homes and one church that BrightRidge has been providing free high-speed internet for since last year will continue to receive that until the mine shuts down as well. The cost will be shared by Red Dog and BrightRidge and is estimated to be valued at $150,000.\n\nWithin 120 days of shutting down the current site, Red Dog would have to remove all equipment from the site, including the pods (storage-unit like buildings) housing the servers. Within 120 days after that, BrightRidge would have to remove all the supporting equipment it provided.\n\nResolution would bring an end to a long dispute that has created a high degree of citizen concern and damaged relations between BrightRidge and the county commission. Ward said he realized the specifics of the deal weren\u2019t likely to seem completely just.\n\n\u201cI know some of you don\u2019t really feel strongly that it\u2019s in the county\u2019s best interest, but that it still satisfies most of what you\u2019re trying to do for your citizens and hopefully gives them some surety of what\u2019s coming down the line, and hopefully gets a chance to build back trust with your partner entity BrightRidge down the road,\u201d Ward said."

        "content": "Leading investor Warren Buffett is well-known for his sharp investment eye and buying companies and acquiring stock and watching values rise over the years.\n\nOne sector that Buffett has shied away from is cryptocurrency. Here's a look at Buffett's thoughts on cryptocurrency and how investors may have wanted to avoid the Oracle of Omaha's advice in this particular case.\n\nWhat Happened: Buffett has been a vocal critic of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) for many years. The bearish position of the Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK)(NYSE:BRK) CEO even made him named Bitcoin enemy number one by entrepreneur Peter Thiel previously.\n\nIn January 2018, Buffett warned investors about investing in cryptocurrency.\n\n\"In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending,\" Buffett said at the time. \"If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I'd be glad to do it but I would never short a dime's worth.\"\n\nRelated Link: Exclusive \u2013 Scaramucci On What Warren Buffett Gets Wrong About Bitcoin\n\nA few month later, Buffett took his feelings on Bitcoin further during an interview with CNBC.\n\nReiterating Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger's thoughts that Bitcoin is \"rat poison,\" Buffett told CNBC anchor Becky Quick that the cryptocurrency is \"probably rat poison squared.\"\n\nBuffett has said that he wouldn't buy Bitcoin even if it dropped to $25.\n\nWhile the billionaire investor has not bought cryptocurrencies and has continued to speak out against them, he does own shares of a company that has bet on Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs Benzinga previously reported, Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are shareholders in Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU), a Latin American digital bank. Nu Holdings is a crypto-friendly bank and has launched several cryptocurrency products along with allocating a portion of its cash to Bitcoin.\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga\u2019s exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets. Tickets are flying: Get yours!\n\nInvesting $1,000 in Bitcoin: While Buffett said he wouldn't invest in Bitcoin even if it hit $25, some investors have chosen to allocate a portion of their investments or holdings in the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin traded between $9,695.12 and $9,964.50 on May 5, 2018 \u2014 the day of Buffett's \"rat poison squared\" comment.\n\nAn investor could have purchased 0.1004 BTC at the coin's high price of that day.\n\nThe $1,000 investment would be worth $3,462.82 today based on a price of $34,490.19 for Bitcoin at the time of writing. This represents a return of 246.3% since Buffett's comments.\n\nFor comparison, shares of Berkshire Hathaway are up 76.2% over the same time period, based on a starting price of $294,720 each.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index, is up 56.8% over the same time period, based on a starting price of $266.89.\n\nAs investors can see, Bitcoin has outperformed both the S&P 500 and Berkshire Hathaway since Buffett's now famous quote about the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Buffett has said he wouldn't touch cryptocurrency even if it hit $25 per coin, investors who bought when the legendary investor made his quote would be glad that they did.\n\nReady to win big?

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC), which got rangebound over the past two-and-a-half months, is up again. Bitcoin has been on a rally over the past couple of weeks, surging more than 25%. The cryptocurrency jumped over 14% last week itself and briefly crossed the $35,000 mark.\n\nSince then, it has been hovering over $34,500. The sudden surge comes as expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the coming days.\n\nThe anticipated green light from the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF is expected to boost demand. This is likely to enable more traditional investors to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through conventional stock markets.\n\nMoreover, it is predicted to draw fresh investments into the crypto industry, potentially leading to an increase in demand.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only reason behind the recent Bitcoin rally. The rally comes amid mixed earnings results from a spate of big tech companies. Investors have lately been ditching the stock market to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nDuring uncertain times, investors tend to gravitate towards safer, less speculative options. Bitcoin, being the most trusted among all cryptocurrencies, has been benefiting the most from this situation.\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency market is not generally regarded as stable or secure, even within this sphere, investors often seek refuge in Bitcoin during periods of surges or rallies in the crypto market.\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nBlackRock, Inc.

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been rising steadily over the past two weeks, growing more than 25%. In the last week itself, it has gone up more than 14% and has briefly breached the $35,000 mark. Currently, it holds firm above the $34,000 support.\n\nThis broad-based BTC rally has coincided with mixed earnings numbers coming in from big tech in the stock market, and there is a visible shift being witnessed in investors who are fleeing the stock market to apply buy-side pressure on Bitcoin. It is widely speculated that the benchmark crypto might breach the $40,000 mark very soon.\n\nBeing the most well-known and \u201creliable\u201d digital coin, BTC has solidified its position within the market itself. In an uncertain environment, investors turn less speculative and rush to safety. The crypto market itself is hardly ever considered stable or safe, but even in this space, investors are prone to clinging to BTC in times of crypto rallies.\n\nWith growing institutional acceptance for crypto across geographies, the benchmark digital currency might be entering a period of less volatility and sustained growth. Multiple traditional financial houses applying for a Bitcoin ETF have also acted as a tailwind. However, this recent rally might be even more significant because it lends credence to the notion that investors are considering Bitcoin as a viable option in times when the stock market is getting routed over a period of time. It will be prudent to watch a few bitcoin-exposed stocks in this light.\n\nBlock Inc. SQ is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants.

        "content": "In a compelling tale of persistence and financial prudence, a Reddit user embarked on a unique investment experiment, demonstrating the potential rewards of consistently investing small amounts, or dollar cost averaging, into Bitcoin.\n\nThe Redditor, going by the handle u/Gorillahair2000, initiated an experiment to determine whether allocating just $5 per day into Bitcoin was a worthwhile endeavor, over the course of one full year, diligently recorded their progress.\n\nAfter 365 days of investing $5 per day, the Redditor accumulated a total stack of 0.075 Bitcoin. The average purchase price stood at $24,108.58, while the current price of Bitcoin was $34,158.20.\n\nThe total expenditure over the year amounted to $1,825.00, and the current value of the investment was $2,585.75, yielding a net change of +41.68%.\n\nThe Redditor also noted that they accounted for the 0.5-1.0% spread on each of their purchases, meaning the gains remained after adjusting for fees. The user indicated that they buy with Strike, a popular Bitcoin Lightning wallet, and then withdraw the Bitcoin to a hardware wallet, in line with industry best practices.\n\nIn a year's time, they transformed the daily expense equivalent to a Starbucks coffee into $2,500 in current value, or a $750 gain.\n\nThe experiment conclusively proves that even with a modest budget, investing in Bitcoin can yield significant returns, and demonstrates the power of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy that involves consistently purchasing assets at fixed intervals, regardless of their price, thereby mitigating the effects of market volatility.\n\nFurther, it also highlights Bitcoin's main advantages as a sound money, one that doesn't depreciate like fiat currencies and other traditional savings vehicles.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Today marks the 15th anniversary of the release of the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Happened: On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto shared the whitepaper, titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\u201d to a mailing list of cryptographers.\n\n\"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party,\" Satoshi famously said in the opening sentence before linking the document titled: \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\"\n\nJust two months later, on January 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined, marking the launch of the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency. Nakamoto\u2019s breakthrough came after being influenced by Wei Dai\u2019s b-money, an earlier electronic peer-to-peer cash system.\n\nMohammed AlKaff AlHashmi, co-founder of HAQQ Network, a blockchain network that issues Islamic Coin, its native cryptocurrency, emphasized the monumental milestone the whitepaper represents. \u201cThe Bitcoin whitepaper\u2019s 15th anniversary is a monumental milestone, not just for the crypto industry but also for the broader financial landscape.\"\n\nHe wrote in a note to Benzinga. \"..the paper laid the groundwork for decentralized finance, challenging the traditional financial systems that have been in place for centuries. Bitcoin has become a store of value.\u201d\n\nReiterating AlHashmi's stance, Robert Quartly-Janeiro, CSO at Bitrue crypto exchange said, \" Bitcoin itself has emerged as the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion.\"\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

U.S. monetary policy may gradually ease next year and currently, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike may peak in the short term. The likelihood of Bitcoin spot ETF approval has significantly increased.\u201d\n\nAs we move into 2024, Lee suggests that after a period of ranging market conditions, the market fundamentals are expected to gradually improve with clear regulatory stances. \"The FOMC meetings in November and December will also set the tone for decisions regarding interest rate hikes and the duration of elevated interest rates. \"\n\nHe added, \"Bitcoin has the potential to break above its recent high of around $32,000 in early 2024, with key levels to watch above at $34,000, $38,000, and $42,000.\"\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $34,318.16, up 0.10% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nPhoto by Oier Aso on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

Discover SCENE\n\nEarn a free on-chain NFT by taking our free course, Crypto Investing:Fundamentals First. Decrypt will cover gas fees for the first 10,000 mints!\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain went live on January 3rd, 2009. At its inception, the Bitcoin network started releasing its own eponymous currency or money. Every ten minutes, the network released 50 BTC to a tiny community of cryptography enthusiasts. Although starting from humble beginnings, its creator Satoshi Nakamoto had an ambitious goal for Bitcoin to be a \u201cpeer-to-peer version of electronic cash\u201d for the world.\n\nAt first, Bitcoin didn\u2019t have a set monetary value because there wasn\u2019t a marketplace for BTC. Without goods and services being offered for Bitcoin, it was difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to determine its price in a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar (USD).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMarket Forces Determine Prices\n\nThe cost of goods, fiat exchange rates (USD to EUR for example), and the spot price of commodities (such as corn and oil) are determined by the laws of supply and demand. When in-demand supplies are created in surplus, prices typically go down when demand remains constant. Likewise, a supply shortage tends to make prices appreciate (assuming demand remains constant). This dynamic also holds true for BTC and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Price Markets: Then and Now\n\nOn May 22, 2010, 10,000 BTC were exchanged for two pizzas in what is widely considered the first BTC purchase (at the time, one BTC was worth $0.004). Subsequently, others started accepting goods and services in exchange for Bitcoin which created a market big enough for robust price discovery \u2014 which is simply the free market method for determining an asset\u2019s price. Since then, people have purchased everything from luxury goods to real estate using BTC.\n\nSince 2010, the price has risen dramatically as demand has typically outpaced supply. From July 2020 onwards, the Bitcoin price has remained above $10,000 and reached an all-time high price of $69,990.90 in November 2021. Eschewing BTC-to-pizza markets, price discovery is now determined primarily on centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) where BTC is traded for fiat (USD, EUR, KRW) and a variety of other cryptocurrencies such as ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC).\n\nWhy Is BTC in Demand?\n\nPut simply, many who purchase and use BTC view it as a fiat currency and payment system alternative. With its limited supply and decentralized nature, some purchase it as an inflation hedge, store of value, or as an investment. Others who have lost confidence in their banking system or national currency prefer an asset that is difficult to confiscate and doesn\u2019t need a trusted third party to make transactions.\n\nBitcoin Price Predictions Vary Widely\n\nFrom being called a \u201cglobal reserve currency\u201d to \u201cabsolutely worthless,\u201d Bitcoin price forecasts vary from zero to over $1 million. Ultimately, the opinions of Bitcoin proponents and detractors won\u2019t determine the price. Like fiat exchange rates and the price of other assets, BTC\u2019s market price is determined by the laws of supply and demand.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

These tales act as a terrifying reminder of the unpredictable nature and volatility present in the cryptocurrency markets and the need to adopt stringent security measures.\n\n1. James Howells and the lost 7,500 BTC\n\nA British man named James Howells unintentionally threw away a hard drive in 2013 that contained 7,500 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at over $258 million. The hard disk is still buried; he can\u2019t figure out where it is, even after making several desperate attempts to retrieve it from the landfill in New Port, Wales. Howell\u2019s story serves as a reminder that digital gold could be turned into digital dust.\n\nJames Howells makes a fresh plea to excavate the landfill site where his discarded hard drive containing 7,500 #Bitcoin likely resides. https://t.co/93AYMQEnrn \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 14, 2021\n\n2. Stefan Thomas and the 7,002 BTC conundrum\n\nSan Francisco-based programmer Stefan Thomas (formerly the chief technology officer at Ripple) was plunged into a Kafkaesque nightmare after he lost the password to his digital wallet. Thomas was left with just two password attempts before the security system would encrypt his fortune forever, rendering them unusable and unreachable, with 7,002 BTC at stake.\n\nThe hard drive, named the Iron Key, boasts an impenetrable design engineered to withstand all types of attacks. Users are granted only ten wrong password attempts before the drive permanently locks out.\n\n\u201cI would just lay in bed and think about it,\u201d Thomas told The New York Times. \u201cThen I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn\u2019t work, and I would be desperate again.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 25, crypto recovery firm Unciphered extended an open letter, offering to unlock an IronKey hard drive owned by Thomas, which holds 7,002 BTC. Despite the offer, Thomas has not taken any action on this matter yet.\n\nA painful memory. I hope others can learn from my mistakes. Test your backups regularly to make sure they are still working. An ounce of foresight could have prevented a decade of regret.\n\n\n\nThat said, I'll do what I always do which is focus on building things, e.g. @Interledger. https://t.co/pCgObeAf4Z \u2014 Stefan Thomas (@justmoon) January 12, 2021\n\n3. Mt. Gox\u2019s mysterious 850,000 BTC vanishing act\n\nMt. Gox \u2014 the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world at the time \u2014 declared bankruptcy in 2014 after a hacker stole 850,000 BTC, estimated to be worth $450 million at the time. The catastrophic collapse, veiled in intrigue, sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community, making investors and enthusiasts fearful and hopeless.\n\nThe unexplained circumstances surrounding the loss further added mystery to the story of Mt. Gox\u2019s collapse. For a very long time, it was unknown exactly how the Bitcoin was stolen and who was behind the hack. The incident sparked investigations, legal disputes and rampant speculation within the crypto community.\n\nOn Oct. 9, the United States Justice Department charged Russian nationals Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner with laundering around 647,000 BTC from the Mt. Gox hack. Bilyuchenko is also charged with operating the illicit exchange BTC-e from 2011 to 2017.\n\nAlmost 10 years later, the victims of Mt. Gox are still waiting for compensation.\n\n4. Gerald Cotten and the $215 million puzzle\n\nIn December 2018, Gerald Cotten, the CEO of QuadrigaCX, embarked on his honeymoon in India with his wife \u2014 a trip that would take a tragic turn. While in India, Cotten, who suffered from Crohn\u2019s disease, faced complications from his illness and passed away, leaving the crypto world in shock.\n\nCotten was the only individual who held the keys to QuadrigaCX\u2019s crypto vault, meaning he had sole access to millions of dollars worth of customer funds.\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrency exchanges, Cotten had not set up a fail-safe mechanism to ensure the transfer of these assets to others in case of his demise. This meant that, when he died, users were left with their funds stranded in the exchange\u2019s wallets.\n\nThe public remained unaware of Cotten\u2019s death for 36 days until January 2019, when the news surfaced. Following Cotten\u2019s death, QuadrigaCX filed for creditor protection, acknowledging the exchange\u2019s dire financial situation, with debts totaling $215 million in cash and Bitcoin owed to its 115,000 investors. Investors, already concerned about their investments, were now faced with a grim reality: their funds might be irretrievably lost due to the lack of access to the exchange\u2019s holdings.\n\nAs investigations unfolded, suspicions regarding the authenticity of Cotten\u2019s death arose. However, the emerging truth was equally shocking: the Ontario Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that before his demise, Cotten had depleted most of the funds through fraudulent trades. This revelation shattered investor trust.\n\n5. The enigmatic journey of the $1.06 billion Bitcoin heist\n\nIn 2018, the seventh-largest Bitcoin wallet at that time, containing a substantial 69,000 BTC, was unexpectedly discovered in a less explored corner of the internet.\n\nThe Bitcoin had been dormant since April 2013. The wallet\u2019s origins were traced back to the shuttered Silk Road darknet market. The marketplace was closed in late 2013 due to illicit activities, and in 2015, its founder, Ross Ulbricht, received a double life sentence plus 40 years with no chance of parole.\n\nNotably, the funds had remained inactive for years after their initial deposit. Then, for the first time in seven years, the billion-dollar worth of BTC witnessed movement in 2018 out of the Bitcoin address 1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx.\n\nAccording to Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder at Elliptic, an encrypted file had been circulating on hacker forums since its discovery, purportedly containing the cryptographic keys required to seize the BTC at this address. If genuine, cracking the password on this file would have allowed the BTC to be moved.\n\nApart from this movement, 101 BTC were sent to BTC-e in 2015, a cryptocurrency exchange notorious for being favored by money launderers that was subsequently taken down by U.S. law enforcement in 2017.\n\nAccording to Robinson, the transfer of the BTC could have been initiated by Ulbricht or a Silk Road vendor accessing their funds. However, the possibility of Ulbricht conducting a Bitcoin transaction from prison seemed unlikely. Alternatively, the encrypted wallet file might have been genuine, and the password could have been successfully cracked, enabling the BTC to be moved.\n\nUpon deeper scrutiny of the Bitcoin address, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office and Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation agents discovered its connection to Individual X (individual\u2019s identity known to concerned authorities), who was found to have hacked funds from Silk Road. Subsequently, following the investigation into the hack, law enforcement confiscated several thousand Bitcoin on Nov. 3, 2020, valued at around $1.06 billion at that time.\n\n6. The cryptocurrency conundrum of Brad Yasar\n\nBrad Yasar, an entrepreneur residing in Los Angeles, has spent numerous hours trying to regain access to his wallets that contain thousands of Bitcoin he mined during the technology\u2019s early days, now valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. Unfortunately, he lost the passwords long ago and has stored the hard drives in vacuum-sealed bags, keeping them out of sight.\n\n\u201cThrough the years I would say I have spent hundreds of hours trying to get back into these wallets,\u201d Yasar told The New York Times. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be reminded every day that what I have now is a fraction of what I could have that I lost,\u201d he said.\n\n7. Gabriel Abed\u2019s 800 Bitcoin loss in a laptop mishap\n\nIn 2011, Gabriel Abed, founder and chairman of Abed Group and co-founder of Bitt, suffered a significant loss when a colleague accidentally reformatted his laptop. This laptop held the private keys to a Bitcoin wallet, resulting in the loss of approximately 800 Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe risk of being my own bank comes with the reward of being able to freely access my money and be a citizen of the world \u2014 that is worth it,\u201d Mr. Abed told The New York Times.\n\nMr. Abed said that the incident had discouraged him, stating that the transparent nature of Bitcoin granted him complete access to the digital financial realm for the very first time.\n\nLike many in the industry, I have made a lot of mistakes with my keys in the early days. In this latest New York Times article about persons who lost their keys, I recap a story of how a reformatted computer would result in a loss,\u2026https://t.co/VNGtRDrPAI https://t.co/cmzxufUWsi \u2014 Gabriel Abed (@Gabriel__Abed) January 12, 2021\n\n8. The unfortunate erasure of Davyd Arakhmia\u2019s cryptocurrency fortune\n\nDavyd Arakhmia, a Ukrainian politician, accidentally deleted an encrypted file from his hard drive containing 400 BTC, unknowingly discarding his private key. Before his political career, Arakhmia ran a business that accepted Bitcoin payments. In an attempt to create more storage space on his hard drive, he deleted the file along with a few movies.\n\nCryptocurrency security: The key to digital wealth protection\n\nIn the volatile cryptocurrency world, digital asset protection is critical. The tales of lost Bitcoin fortunes highlight how important it is to implement strong security measures. Safeguarding cryptocurrency holdings and ensuring private key accessibility should be top priorities for all investors.\n\nEssentials include secured connections, frequent backups and a trustworthy, self-custodial wallet. Moreover, two-factor authentication provides an additional line of protection, while distributing assets among several wallets protects against losses. Also, it is equally important to remain vigilant against phishing efforts and keep up with the latest developments in security procedures."

        "title": "Bitcoin futures data highlight investors' bullish view, but there's a catch - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price surged by 26.5% in October, and several indicators hit a one-year high, including the BTC futures premium and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) discount.\n\nFor this reason, it\u2019s challenging to present a bearish thesis for BTC as data reflects the post-FTX-Alameda Research collapse recovery period and is also influenced by the recent increase in interest rates by the United States Federal Reserve.\n\nDespite the positive indicators, Bitcoin price remains around 50% below its all-time high of $69,900, which was hit in November 2021. In contrast, gold is trading just 4.3% below its $2,070 level from March 2022. This stark difference diminishes the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s year-to-date gains of 108% and highlights that Bitcoin\u2019s adoption as an alternative hedge is still in its early stages.\n\nBefore deciding whether the improvement in Bitcoin futures premium, open interest and the GBTC fund premium signal a return to the norm or the initial signs of institutional investors\u2019 interest, it\u2019s essential for investors to analyze the macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe U.S. budget issue sparks Bitcoin\u2019s institutional hope\n\nOn Oct. 30, the U.S. Treasury Department announced plans to auction off $1.6 trillion of debt over the next six months. However, the key factor to watch is the auction size and the balance between shorter-term Treasury bills and longer-duration notes and bonds, according to CNBC.\n\nBillionaire and Duquesne Capital founder Stanley Druckenmiller criticized Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s focus on shorter-term debt, calling it \u201cthe biggest blunder in the history of the Treasury.\u201c This unprecedented increase in the debt rate by the world\u2019s largest economy has led Druckenmiller to praise Bitcoin as an alternative store of value.\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin futures open interest, reaching its highest level since May 2022 at $15.6 billion, can be attributed to institutional demand driven by inflationary risks in the economy. Notably, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has become the second-largest trading venue for Bitcoin derivatives, with $3.5 billion notional of BTC futures.\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin futures premium, which measures the difference between two-month contracts and the spot price, has reached its highest level in over a year. These fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are requesting more money to delay settlement.\n\nBitcoin two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe demand for leveraged BTC long positions has significantly increased, as the futures contract premium jumped from 3.5% to 8.3% on Oct. 31, surpassing the neutral-to-bullish threshold of 5% for the first time in 12 months.\n\nFurther bolstering the speculation of institutional demand is Grayscale\u2019s GBTC fund discount, narrowing the gap to the equivalent underlying BTC holdings. This instrument was trading at a 20.7% discount on Sept. 30 but has since reduced this deficit to 14.9% as investors anticipate a higher likelihood of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the United States.\n\nNot everything is rosy for Bitcoin, and exchange risks loom\n\nWhile the data seems undeniably positive for Bitcoin, especially compared to previous months, investors should take exchange-provided numbers with caution, particularly when dealing with unregulated derivatives contracts.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate has surged to 5.25%, and exchange risks have escalated post-FTX, making the 8.6% Bitcoin futures premium less bullish. For comparison, the CME Bitcoin annualized premium stands at 6.8%, while Comex gold futures trade at a 5.5% premium, and CME\u2019s S&P 500 futures trade at 4.9% above spot prices.\n\nRelated: Will weakness in Magnificent 7 stocks spread to Bitcoin price?\n\nThe Bitcoin futures premium, in the broader context, is not excessively high, especially considering that Bloomberg analysts give a 95% chance of approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Investors are also mindful of the general risks in cryptocurrency markets, as highlighted by U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis\u2019s call for the Justice Department to take \u201cswift action\u201d against Binance and Tether.\n\nThe approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF could trigger sell pressure from GBTC holders. Part of the $21.4 billion in GBTC holdings will finally be able to exit their positions at par after years of limitations imposed by Grayscale\u2019s administration and exorbitant 2% yearly fees. In essence, the positive data and performance of Bitcoin reflect a return to the mean rather than excessive optimism.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) options volumes experienced a significant surge on Oct. 23 and Oct. 24, marking the highest level in over six months. This activity coincided with a remarkable 17% BTC price rally over two days. Traders are now pondering whether the increased activity in the BTC options market can be solely attributed to the anticipation of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) or if the optimism has dwindled following the recent price surge above $34,000.\n\nThe recent gains are a rare sight in 2023, even considering Bitcoin\u2019s impressive 108% year-to-date performance. Notably, the last instance of such price action occurred on March 14 when Bitcoin surged from $20,750 to $26,000 in just two days, marking a 25.2% price increase.\n\nDeribit BTC options daily volume, in BTC. Source: Deribit\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting the significance of the fact that a staggering 208,000 contracts changed hands in a mere two days. To put this into perspective, the prior peak, which occurred on Aug. 18, saw a total of 132,000 contracts exchanged, but that was during a period when Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted by 10.7% from $29,090 to $25,980 in just two days. Interestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s options open interest, which measures outstanding contracts for every expiry, reached its highest level in over 12 months on Oct. 26.\n\nThis surge in activity has led some analysts to emphasize the potential \u201cgamma squeeze\" risk. This theoretical analysis seeks to capture the need for option market makers to cover their risk based on their likely exposure.\n\nthe #bitcoin gamma squeeze from last week could happen again\n\n\n\nif BTCUSD moves higher to $35,750-36k, options dealers will need to buy $20m in spot BTC for every 1% upside move, which could cause explosiveness if we begin to move up towards those levels\n\n\n\nmore pic.twitter.com/OA9tJ0ZaK9 \u2014 Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) October 30, 2023\n\nAccording to estimates from Galaxy Research and Amberdata, BTC options market makers may need to cover $40 million for every 2% positive move in Bitcoin\u2019s spot price. While this number may seem substantial, it pales in comparison to Bitcoin\u2019s staggering daily adjusted volume of $7.8 billion.\n\nAnother aspect to consider when assessing Bitcoin options volume and total open interest is whether these instruments have primarily been used for hedging purposes or neutral-to-bullish strategies. To address this ambiguity, one should closely monitor the demand difference between call (buy) and put (sell) options.\n\nBitcoin options put-to-call volume ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nNotably, the period from Oct. 16 to Oct. 26 saw a predominance of neutral-to-bullish call options, with the ratio consistently remaining below 1. Consequently, the excessive volume observed on Oct. 23 and 24 was skewed toward call options.\n\nHowever, the landscape changed as investors increasingly sought protective put options, reaching a peak of 68% higher demand on Oct. 28. More recently, the metric shifted to a neutral 1.10 ratio on Oct. 30, indicating a balanced demand between put and call options.\n\nHow confident are Bitcoin option traders?\n\nTo gauge whether investors using options have grown more confident as Bitcoin\u2019s price held above $34,000 on Oct. 30, one should analyze the Bitcoin options delta skew. When traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the delta 25% skew tends to rise above 7%, while periods of excitement typically see it dip below negative 7%.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe Bitcoin options\u2019 25% delta skew shifted to a neutral position on Oct. 24 after residing in bullish territory for five consecutive days. However, as investors realized that the $33,500 support level proved more resilient than anticipated, their confidence improved on Oct. 27, causing the skew indicator to reenter the bullish zone below negative 7%.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin\u2019s bull move might not be over yet \u2014 Here are 3 reasons why\n\nExtraordinary options premiums and continued optimism\n\nTwo noteworthy observations emerge from this data. Bitcoin bulls utilizing options contracts prior to the 17% rally that began on Oct. 23 were paying the highest premium relative to put options in over 12 months. A negative 18% skew is highly uncommon and signifies extreme confidence or optimism, likely fueled by expectations of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhat stands out most, however, is the present negative 13% skew after Bitcoin\u2019s price surged by 26.7% in the 15 days leading up to Oct. 27. Normally, investors would seek protective puts to hedge some of their gains, but this did not occur. Consequently, even if the initial demand for call options was primarily driven by ETF expectations, the prevailing optimism has endured as Bitcoin soared above $34,000.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

However, in a September 2022 interview, he revealed he had sold it in light of central banks imposing tightening measures.\n\nHe did, however, say the digital asset sector would flourish in the event that people lose faith in the central banking system, making an example of the Bank of England after the British pound plummeted in mid-2022.\n\n\u201cI could see cryptocurrency having a big role in a Renaissance because people just aren\u2019t going to trust the central banks.\u201d\n\nDruckenmiller founded Duquesne Capital Management in 1981 and closed the fund in 2010. During that time, he achieved an average annual return of 30% and never experienced a down year.\n\nHis investment philosophy revolved around holding a group of stocks long, a group of stocks short and using leverage to trade futures in times of rising and falling markets.\n\nHe\u2019s also praised blockchain technology, predicting that a ledger-based system could replace the United States dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency in the future.\n\nIn 2021, Druckenmiller said Ethereum is like \u201cMyspace before Facebook\u201d and predicted that Ether (ETH) would eventually flip BTC.\n\nRelated: \u2018Bitcoin is an international asset' \u2014 BlackRock CEO\u2019s bullish remarks\n\nSentiment toward Bitcoin among Wall Street firms has warmed up over the last year, most notably evidenced by a wave of proposed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund filings from major financial firms.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry still has its fair share of critics, though.\n\nCharlie Munger has called bitcoin Rat Poison.\n\n\n\nWarren Buffett has called it Rat Poison Squared.\n\n\n\nBut here's the thing.\n\n\n\nIf Rat Poison is a BIG *negative* (eg, -1,000,000), shouldn't Rat Poison Squared be an EVEN BIGGER *positive* (eg, +1,000,000,000,000)?\n\n\n\nIt's just math, folks! pic.twitter.com/UYobxYU08L \u2014 10-K Diver (@10kdiver) July 2, 2021\n\nWell-known veteran investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have long referred to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as \u201crat poison\u201d and an asset class that produces no value.\n\nMagazine: Gary Gensler\u2019s job at risk, BlackRock\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF and other news: Hodler\u2019s Digest, June 11\u201317"

The fund will work by purchasing and selling a mix of call and put options contracts that \u201cutilize the bitcoin futures ETF as the reference asset,\u201d the prospectus says. Unlike typical covered call ETFs, the fund will not be selling call options on a security that it already owns. Instead, it would gain exposure to bitcoin futures through options contracts that use the bitcoin futures ETF as the reference asset.\n\n\u201cThe benefit of using bitcoin for a covered call strategy is that bitcoin is extremely volatile,\u201d etf.com analyst Sumit Roy said. \u201cThat volatility makes options for bitcoin valuable, increasing the income potential for strategies that sell those options.\u201d\n\nThe price of notoriously volatile bitcoin has surged 27% this month on expectations that a spot bitcoin ETF may be launched in the U.S. this year. Cryptocurrency investors appear to be betting the so-called crypto winter has thawed and are looking for ways to boost their exposure to the asset.\n\nJEPI-Like Call Options Gain Popularity\n\n\u201cHowever, the volatility cuts both ways,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWhile the potential for high income is there, so too is the potential for big losses should bitcoin go down.\u201d\n\nThe fund will generate income by selling call options that reference the bitcoin futures ETF, but this technique will also limit the amount that the fund can see potential upside of bitcoin futures ETF\u2019s share price.\n\n\u201cI think where you'd get in trouble with a Bitcoin covered call ETF is that you're cashing in the tail risk to upside, but keeping the tail risk to the downside,\" said analyst at Morningstar Bryan Armour.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fund will pay income to investors monthly. The ETF can also hold some traditional call option positions, according to its filing.\n\nRoundhill\u2019s move to launch the fund comes as multiple ETF issuers, including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, are vying to launch an ETF that tracks spot bitcoin. While the SEC allows ETFs that track bitcoin futures, the largest being the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the agency has historically rejected funds that track physical bitcoin based on concerns of market manipulation.\n\nAfter the smashing success of JPMorgan\u2019s Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), which took in $12.7 billion this year, firms have also been looking to call options as a way to generate income for investors. Goldman Sachs, as well as BlackRock, have both launched options writing funds this fall.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a regulated derivatives exchange that lists Bitcoin (BTC) futures, now stands just behind Binance in terms of notional open interest to rank second in the list of BTC futures exchanges.\n\nThe CME\u2019s open interest hit $3.58 billion on Oct. 30, pushing the regulated derivatives exchange platform to jump two positions from the previous week. The CME overtook Bybit and OKX with $2.6 billion and $1.78 billion in open interest, respectively, and is just a few million away from Binance\u2019s $3.9 billion.\n\nBitcoin Futures Exchange rankings by open interest. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe standard Bitcoin futures contract offered by CME is valued at five BTC, while the micro contract is worth a tenth of a Bitcoin. Perpetual futures, instead of ordinary futures contracts, are the main focus of open interest in offshore exchanges, as they come without an expiration date and use the funding rate method to maintain their price parity with the market price.\n\nBitcoin open interest refers to the total number of outstanding Bitcoin futures or options contracts in the market. It measures the amount of money invested in Bitcoin derivatives at any given time. The open interest measures the capital flowing in and out of the market. If more capital flows to Bitcoin futures, the open interest will increase. However, if the capital flows out, the open interest will decline. Hence, increasing open interest reflects a bullish sentiment, whereas a declining open interest indicates bearish sentiment.\n\nRelated: Blockchain congestion and transaction queues actually deter \u2018nefarious actors\u2019: Study\n\nThe CME\u2019s rising open interest not only helped the regulated futures exchange to climb to the second spot among futures crypto exchanges but also saw its cash-settled futures contracts exceed 100,000 BTC in volume. The rising interest of traders in the Bitcoin futures market has also propelled the CME to attain 25% of the Bitcoin futures market share.\n\nA majority chunk of investment into CME futures has come via standard futures contracts, indicating an influx of institutional interest as Bitcoin registered a massive double-digit surge in October, helping it reach a new one-year high above $35,000.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

        "content": "Supply and demand dynamics could mitigate concerns of a potential Bitcoin (BTC) market supply shock during the upcoming mining reward halving in 2024, according to Bitvavo CEO Mark Nuvelstijn.\n\nThe co-founder of the Netherlands-based cryptocurrency exchange weighed in on Bitcoin-related market movements in conversation with Cointelegraph during the European Blockchain Convention held in Barcelona.\n\nRelated: There are now nearly 40M Bitcoin addresses in profit \u2014 A new record\n\nNuvelstijn expressed his belief that exchanges would likely have sufficient Bitcoin supply to meet the demand from users:\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s more demand, the price will increase, and it will keep increasing until there\u2019s a match between price and demand.\u201d\n\nThe Bitvavo CEO added that the potential booming demand for Bitcoin would increase prices until demand cools and prices stabilize. As a result, Nuvelstijn is not concerned that exchanges like his would run out of BTC to meet trading demands:\n\n\u201cAs a platform, we\u2019re agnostic to that. We are just matching buy and sell orders to make trades possible. If there\u2019s a lot of demand for Bitcoin, it\u2019s only a good thing for the sector.\u201d\n\nNuvelstijn also weighed in on Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications filed in the United States over the past year and the potential impact their approval could have on the value of Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more attention, more interest in the crypto market. You saw how steeply the Bitcoin price increased over the past two weeks. It was up 20 or 30 percent, which is a massive jump.\u201d\n\nBitvavo has seen an increase in web traffic, as well as customers visiting their platform and using their app. The exchange has onboarded new customers as well, while Nuvelstijn added that these numbers were still short of the levels it saw in 2021:\n\n\u201cAs you mentioned, the ETFs are not yet approved, right? So this is, let\u2019s say, a pre-event. The event itself still needs to happen.\u201d\n\nNuvelstijn also explained that while Bitvavo\u2019s core markets remain the Netherlands and Belgium, it is eyeing steady expansion into jurisdictions including France, Spain and Italy. He also believes that the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) will drive market maturity and ease of doing business:\n\n\u201cIt will open up the European market, so you no longer need a license per country. The regulation will become more harmonized, meaning you can easily do cross-border business.\u201d\n\nNuvelstijn also sees MiCA laying the foundation for cryptocurrency companies to offer more financial services, drawing comparisons to conventional financial regulations:\n\n\u201cIt will be easier for crypto companies to offer financial services and for financial services to offer crypto services. I think you will see those kinds of business models being more commingled.\u201d\n\nA report from a Standard Chartered analyst in July 2023 suggests that growing institutional demand for Bitcoin could drive the price of BTC to around $120,000 by the end of the year, driven by increased mining profitability, which will ease the need to sell mined coins.\n\nMagazine: The Truth Behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution: An on-the-ground report"

        "content": "Update: This article has been updated to highlight that the UN report referenced the Mora et al. 2018 paper, which overestimated the emissions of mining operations by including unprofitable mining rigs in their analysis.\n\nA recent study conducted by the United Nations suggests a direct correlation between the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and the energy needed for mining operations.\n\nUN scientists evaluated the activities of 76 Bitcoin mining nations during the 2020\u20132021 period and found that the global Bitcoin mining network consumed 173.42 terawatt-hours of electricity. During this timeframe, the crypto ecosystem was undergoing a bull run, and Bitcoin rallied to mark its all-time high of $69,000. The UN report highlighted:\n\n\u201cA 400% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price from 2021 to 2022 triggered a 140% increase in the energy consumption of the worldwide Bitcoin mining network.\u201d\n\nAt the time, fossil energy sources accounted for 67% of the electricity generated for Bitcoin mining. However, crypto entrepreneurs have taken proactive measures to increase their dependence on green energy.\n\nHydropower satisfied over 16% of the total electricity demand of the global Bitcoin mining network; nuclear, solar and wind energy sources provided 9%, 2% and 5%, respectively.\n\nHowever, members of the crypto community called out the UN report for referencing the Mora et al. 2018 paper, which had overestimated the carbon emission levels of Bitcoin mining rigs by including unprofitable mining rigs in their analysis.\n\nOne of the crazy things about the UN paper is that the authors did read the rebuttals to the Mora et al paper because they cite the Houy 2019 paper, but only to note that BTC price is a factor in determining BTC mining profitability. The UN authors completely ignored the opening\u2026 \u2014 Margot Paez / jyn urso (@jyn_urso) October 25, 2023\n\nNic Carter criticized the UN report for citing \"completely fake academia in their papers (mora et al 2018)\".\n\nAccording to the UN report, the top 10 Bitcoin mining nations at the time \u2014 China, United States, Kazakhstan, Russia, Malaysia, Canada, Germany, Iran, Ireland and Singapore \u2014 were responsible for 92%\u201394% of the global carbon, water and land footprint of Bitcoin.\n\nThe global push for greener alternatives to fulfill the grid demand will also help reduce the carbon footprint of Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining is becoming more environmentally friendly\n\nRecently, Genesis Digital Assets Limited, a mining and data center company with over 400 megawatts (MW) of power generation worldwide, opened a new data center in Sweden running 1,900 Bitcoin mining machines, driven by the country\u2019s burgeoning renewable energy surplus.\n\nChristian Anders, founder of BT.CX, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin mining is not very common due to high energy prices. However, he added:\n\n\u201cSweden, Finland and Norway have a surplus of energy and negative energy prices from time to time, and primarily renewable energy in the form of hydropower in a remote location which is hard to distribute.\u201d\n\nIn parallel, Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturers continue to deliver energy-efficient hardware. At the World Digital Mining Summit on Sept. 22, Bitcoin miners shared their plans to help decarbonize the crypto ecosystem.\n\nBitmain rolled out its efficiency-focused Antminer S21, while Nazar Khan, chief operating officer of TerraWulf, highlighted that the role Bitcoin rig manufacturers play \u201cis locating our Bitcoin mining loads in places where that\u2019s happening and how do we facilitate that decarbonization process.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?"

        "content": "The mega-cap tech stocks, which saw a robust start in 2023, are now grappling with massive trillion-dollar losses, leaving their shareholders concerned. Wall Street\u2019s unease over surging bond yields and higher interest rates has cast a shadow on these companies. Traders are now pondering the potential impact on Bitcoin (BTC) if the S&P 500 downtrend continues.\n\nConsequently, investors must investigate the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 and consider whether cryptocurrencies can thrive in an environment of high interest rates.\n\nBloomberg Magnificent 7 index vs. S&P 500 equal weight index. Source: Bloomberg\n\nThe seven-largest tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla, collectively constitute a staggering 29% of the S&P 500, marking the highest concentration ever recorded in this stock market index. However, since the end of July, these tech giants have witnessed a substantial erosion in their market value, with a staggering $1.2 trillion loss.\n\nReal Money\u2019s James DePorre notes that \u201c73% of stocks in the market are more than 20% below their highs,\u201d which technically defines a bear market. This underscores growing worries in the broader economy apart from the top seven stocks.\n\nIn its endeavor to regain credibility in combating inflation, the United States Federal Reserve has indicated its intention to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period. Crescat Capital warns that a significant decline in the S&P 500, coupled with a widening of corporate credit spreads, could elevate the likelihood of an economic downturn.\n\nHigher interest rates impact stocks and commodities\n\nCrescat Capital has also raised concerns about the wave of corporate and sovereign debt maturing in 2024, which will necessitate refinancing at substantially higher interest rates. They recommend exposure to commodities due to their historical resilience during inflationary periods, exacerbated by the challenge faced by commodity producers in investing in fixed assets.\n\nDespite the vast difference in market capitalization, totaling $10.5 trillion for Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla, compared to cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins), which fall short by over nine times, there are some intriguing parallels.\n\nFirst, both markets exhibit a scarcity quality that correlates with the monetary base. In essence, both react similarly to the actions of the Fed, where increased circulation benefits scarce assets, while a restrictive policy with high interest rates favors fixed-income investments.\n\nAdditionally, the trend toward digitalization has transformed the way people use apps and mobile services, particularly in financial services. Given the limited adaptability of traditional providers, often due to regulatory constraints, it\u2019s not surprising that the public is embracing cryptocurrencies, even in the form of stablecoins. The growing demand for fully digital services is a secular trend that positively influences both the crypto and tech sectors.\n\nDecoupling of the S&P 500 and cryptocurrencies\n\nThe performance of the top seven S&P 500 stocks can decouple from cryptocurrencies regardless of the time frame. Currently, Bitcoin is trading approximately 50% below its all-time high, while Apple and Microsoft are down 13% and 7% from their peaks, respectively. This discrepancy is partly due to investor concerns about a looming recession or a preference for companies with substantial reserves, whereas cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins, lack cash flow or earnings.\n\nHistorical 30-day correlation between Bitcoin/USD and S&P 500 futures. Source: TradingView\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, stocks and cryptocurrencies inhabit different realms, but this contrast underscores how Bitcoin can grow independently of retail adoption and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as evident by MicroStrategy\u2019s $5.4 billion direct investment in the cryptocurrency.\n\nRelated: \u2018Sodl\u2019 too soon: US gov\u2019t missed Bitcoin gains now total $6B\n\nThe top seven tech companies hold a combined $596 billion in cash and equivalents, enough to purchase the entire circulating supply of Bitcoin, assuming 3.7 million coins are lost forever. Furthermore, these companies are projected to generate $650 billion in earnings within the next five years. So, even if those companies continue to decline, their cash position could eventually shift to commodities including Bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. housing market, another pinnacle of savings for the economy, is facing problems of its own due to record-high mortgage rates. Sales of previously owned homes in September dropped to the slowest pace since October 2010, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nUltimately, a downturn in the S&P 500, whether driven by mega-cap tech stocks or other factors, may not necessarily spell doom for cryptocurrencies. Investors often seek diversification to mitigate risk, and Bitcoin\u2019s low correlation with traditional markets, along with early signs of trouble in the real estate sector, offers an attractive condition for alternative hedges, as signaled by legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "The bitcoin price chart just flashed a bullish signal that typically heralds a big rally is on the horizon. On Monday, the cryptocurrency formed a \"golden cross,\" a pattern that's drawn when the 50-day moving average crosses through, and above, an ascending 200-day moving average. Traders and analysts use it as an indicator that a market trend is about to turn more positive. The opposite, or so-called death cross, indicates a bearish change. \"Golden and dark crosses tend to develop during overbought or oversold environments respectively,\" Rob Ginsberg, an analyst at Wolfe Research, told CNBC. \"They help to reinforce the improving or deteriorating trend but, by definition, they lag the price action that has already occurred, which is why you tend to see modest consolidation after such a signal.\" Bitcoin has already turned higher, as growing optimism around the likelihood a bitcoin exchange-traded fund will debut in coming months pushed its price to $35,000 last week. The cryptocurrency finished the week up 10%, its best week since June, according to Coin Metrics. While it wouldn't surprise analysts to see the price pull back after a rally of that size, bitcoin is still near its latest peak. Ari Wald, a chart watcher at Oppenheimer, sees the golden cross as a confirmation of the recent uptrend rather than an actionable price signal because the pattern occurs after the price has already moved. \"Every big price move starts with a positive cross, but not every positive cross leads to a big move,\" he told CNBC. Investors are closely watching the outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting that wraps up Wednesday, and Chair Jerome Powell's language on the future direction of interest rates. Historically, a high rate environment has hurt bitcoin, and some traders are expecting current central bank policy to cast a shadow over crypto even in the face of two positive catalysts: the regulatory approval of an ETF and the Bitcoin halving. Bitcoin's 50-day moving average last closed above the 200-day average on Sept. 11. However, the last \"golden cross\" with an ascending 200-day moving average took place Feb. 11, according to Coin Metrics. The slope of the 200-day moving average should continue to point higher as long as the breakout above the second-quarter peaks hold, Wald said. \u2014 CNBC's Nick Wells contributed reporting."

        "title": "In Texas, Bitcoin Springs from Gas Wells | Mint - Mint",
        "content": "Big swings in the price of natural gas whipsaw producers. Chris Alfano thinks the solution lies in something even more volatile: bitcoin.\n\nThe 29-year-old recently led a group of oil-and-gas veterans through a field of pipelines and wells outside Fort Worth, Texas, passing two giant orange generators before reaching a gleaming white structure about the size of a tractor trailer. Alfano\u2019s company, 360 Mining, mines bitcoin here, using power generated from natural gas produced by the wells.\n\nAlfano\u2019s pitch to these prospective clients: They can earn $10 or more from burning a thousand cubic feet of gas to mine the cryptocurrency instead of selling it for $1.50 or less. \u201cThis is wildcatting on the bitcoin side,\" he shouts over the generators\u2019 roar.\n\nIt\u2019s an expensive bet on a risky asset. Building a gas-powered mine costs at least a million dollars, and bitcoin\u2019s value is notoriously unstable. But natural-gas prices have slumped to about half of their levels a year ago, largely because of last year\u2019s warm winter denting demand.\n\nThat oil-and-gas producers would even contemplate bitcoin mining shows how desperate they are for solutions, even outlandish ones.\n\nThe goal isn\u2019t to replace natural gas. Instead, bitcoin serves as a counterweight. When gas prices go up, the producers will sell that. When prices go down, they can burn it to run banks of power-hungry computers cranking out reams of random numbers to generate freshly minted crypto coins.\n\nTo Alfano, a self-described \u201cspreadsheet guy\" who built his own gas-powered bitcoin mine during the pandemic, the logic is straightforward. The oil-and-gas veterans aren\u2019t so sure what to make of the ephemeral world of crypto.\n\nUsing their own gas will minimize bitcoin mining\u2019s major expense: power. But their revenues will rise and fall with bitcoin\u2019s value, which has swung between about $3,000 and $60,000 over the past five years. Their returns also will be threatened by competition. The number of coins they will earn can be reduced by new miners joining the fray and by old ones upgrading their machines.\n\nDespite the risk, some producers are taking the plunge. Todd Hallmark, 37, oversees the family-run Bob Hughes Oil Company, named after his grandfather. Hallmark had no interest in crypto-anything until last year. The operator of the pipeline that transports gas from his 14 wells in Eldorado, Texas, jacked up rates so much he would have been better off burning it than selling it.\n\nHallmark considers himself pretty handy and has worked on oil rigs since he was eight years old. He still hired Alfano to help build his bitcoin mine. He couldn\u2019t imagine doing it on his own.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a small oil and gas company,\" he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not computer people.\"\n\nAlfano never aspired to become the oil-patch\u2019s bitcoin Johnny Appleseed. He grew up in Manhattan Beach, Calif., the son of a car-dealership owner and a homemaker. He studied finance and economics at Southern Methodist University and, like many others, caught the bitcoin bug in 2020 when the pandemic sent the digital currency\u2019s value soaring. He was astonished by the profits that could be made by \u201cjust plugging in a computer.\"\n\nAlfano was living in Austin, married to his college sweetheart with two young daughters, and mining was something he could do on his own. The autonomy reminded him of a business he ran in middle school, scouring local shops for underpriced used surfboards and selling them for a profit on Craigslist.\n\nTexas had oodles of gas, and buying his own wells would give him even more control over his fate, assets that reassured the investors he needed and the option to sell gas should bitcoin collapse. He thought it would be easy.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t.\n\nAlfano raised $6 million from investors in October 2021 when bitcoin was trading around $60,000. He closed on his site outside Fort Worth, bought hundreds of high-end computers, installed a state-of-the-art liquid-cooling system and leased seven generators to power the setup. Mining started in February 2022.\n\nThings didn\u2019t go to plan. Generators kept shutting down. Servers didn\u2019t run properly. The cooling system didn\u2019t cool. Over the next four months, bitcoin tumbled to $30,000 in May and $20,000 in June.\n\nBy then, Alfano concluded his mine\u2019s design was fatally flawed. He shut it down and started selling his gas instead.\n\nYet even as the \u201ceasy\" profits evaporated, Russia invaded Ukraine. Natural-gas prices soared to more than $9 per thousand cubic feet from about $3.50 at the start of the year.\n\nThat bought him time. Alfano redesigned and rebuilt his mine. In March of this year, after natural-gas prices collapsed and bitcoin had begun to rebound, he was ready to start mining again.\n\nToday, Alfano uses his initial failure as a selling point.\n\nAmong the lessons he learned: you can\u2019t hook the wells up directly to generators that power the mine. They need a steady flow of fuel. To provide that, Alfano installed two rocket-shaped tanks that moderate the flow of fuel between the wells and generators.\n\n\u201cThis was a lot of sleepless nights,\" he tells his recent tour group, \u201ca lot of lost money before we put these things in.\"\n\nThe oil-and-gas veterans remain skeptical, but don\u2019t dismiss Alfano\u2019s pitch.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see how you can buy something and call it a coin, but yet it never falls into anyone\u2019s hands,\" said Bobby Flournoy, 75, president of Dallas-based Energy Investment Partners, an oil and gas exploration and production company. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a product, in my opinion, being generated here.\"\n\nSandy Pofahl, 82, who has developed oil and gas properties since the 1980s, said he has similar doubts about crypto. Yet, after taking Alfano\u2019s tour, he is looking into organizing a group to link some wells to a mine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s for real,\" he said about bitcoin. \u201cBut it persists. It\u2019s been around a long while and sure it goes up and it goes down, but it goes up three and comes down two and it\u2019s been doing this forever. Bottom line, it\u2019s hung in there.\"\n\nWrite to Bob Henderson at bob.henderson@wsj.com\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "Bitcoin Trading Sideways But $38600 BTC Price Expected - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin started a sideways movement on October 24.\n\nOn-chain evidence suggests a strong buying activity ahead.\n\nChart analysis shows a new high to come at $38,600.\n\nAfter reaching its new yearly high of $35,000 on October 24, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been trading sideways. It managed to maintain trading around this high and is now back slightly below the level.\n\nWith some new on-chain evidence suggesting investors\u2019 interest, there are reasons to believe it can continue rising to a new high. Can the BTC price make it to its next resistance at $38,600?\n\nOn-chain Data\n\nBitcoin\u2018s on-chain data suggests that significant investors, often referred to as whales, have been active during its recent surge above $35,000. According to blockchain analytics company IntoTheBlock , there were 23,400 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain involving transfers of $100,000 or more in BTC, marking a yearly peak, as reported last week.\n\nThis peak occurred on October 24 and has since decreased to 12,230, but it continues to reflect a bullish sentiment.\n\nAnalyzing the distribution of holdings, there is a noticeable 4.85% increase in the category of large holders with holdings ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 BTC. This surge in supply distribution among whales has been observed since its peak on October 24, suggesting that whales have been accumulating the coin at these levels and are now likely providing price support.\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nAnalyzing Bitcoin\u2019s price, the chart suggests there\u2019s room for a potential growth. The recent uptrend started on October 12 appears to be forming a five-wave pattern, with the last high on October 24 being the wave 3.\n\nThe sideways movement observed since the peak likely represents a consolidation phase, considered wave 4, preceding a potential upward surge that would mark the anticipated completion of wave 5.\n\nThis forthcoming ascent could approach just below the $40,000 mark, in alignment with a significant resistance level at $38,600. However, as this might conclude the final wave of a trend that commenced on November 21, a substantial decline could ensue.\n\nShould this signal the initiation of a new bullish phase following an extended downtrend, the next crucial step would be establishing the first higher low in this bull market. This may manifest as an ABC correction, signifying a higher-degree wave 2. Ideally, this dip should not dip below $25,000.\n\nIf the price nears the projected $40,000 peak and then experiences a 38% decline, it may prompt short-term traders to reevaluate their investments. Conversely, it could provide more favorable entry points for long-term holders and potentially stimulate another buying surge, essential for the next significant upswing.\n\nIn the short term, bullish momentum is likely to prevail in surpassing the current local resistance at the last high. Following an encounter with the $38,600 level, we will reevaluate our projections. However, for now, a more substantial downward movement is anticipated afterward.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF: What Could Go Wrong? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is on its way to Wall Street, if market prognosticators are to be believed, and this will be great for the crypto industry.\n\nThat\u2019s not as universally believed as recent price rallies might suggest.\n\nAnalysts from CryptoQuant said that the approval of such a product\u2014which investors have been waiting on for over 10 years\u2014will mean institutions flood the space with cash, in turn leading the price of Bitcoin to rocket.\n\nThis may\u2014or may not\u2014be true. Others, like Hayden Hughes, co-founder of social-trading platform Alpha Impact, who spoke to Bloomberg, have posited that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF has already been priced in, meaning there\u2019s a low chance the price will sustain any massive gains.\n\nBut even if the market cap and price of Bitcoin does go through the roof and the entire crypto industry thrives, will it be a good thing? Privacy-focused Bitcoiners have even said that such a product goes against everything that Bitcoin stands for.\n\nExperts like those at Nym Technologies and Wasabi Wallet previously told Decrypt that Wall Street interest in the cryptocurrency could lead governments to strongarm crypto users into restriction, penalties, or taxes.\n\nThe reasoning is that lawmakers are already cracking down on the crypto industry and are increasingly focused on anti-money laundering (AML) procedures\u2014as seen with major crypto brands like Coinbase and Binance.\n\nOthers have argued that with Wall Street titans barging in on the market, the cryptocurrency will become more centralized and correlated with traditional stocks. Bitcoiners have been waiting and hoping for years that the coin would decouple from securities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBob Bodily, CEO of Ordinals marketplace Bioniq, told Decrypt that a Bitcoin ETF could ruin Bitcoin\u2019s original censorship resistant promise.\n\n\u201cThe worry with a Bitcoin ETF is that we\u2019ll have so much Bitcoin locked up in ETFs that now we have compromised the original vision for Bitcoin where we have tons of Bitcoin in ETFs that are highly correlated to stocks, behave like stocks, people buy and sell them like stocks and in the large majority of cases we\u2019re going to have central custodian ownership,\u201d he said.\n\nBodily was referring to Bitcoin\u2019s quality of allowing anyone to use the network and make transactions\u2014without getting shut down by a government or authority. The idea is that anyone who can download Bitcoin wallet software, run a node, and complete transactions can do so without being stopped. And typically it\u2019s hard to stop that.\n\nBut if Bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street and centralized custodians become the norm\u2014and perhaps the only known way\u2014for people to get exposure to Bitcoin, users could eventually get banned from the network.\n\n\u201cAs long as you can self-custody, then you can be a unique, individual participant in the Bitcoin network,\u201d added Bodily. \u201cIf Bitcoin ETFs become the only legal way to access Bitcoin, and self-custody is illegal (like Gold was back in the 70s), then this would compromise Bitcoin\u2019s core value proposition because people couldn\u2019t legally self-custody their assets.\u201d\n\nCraig Raw, developer of the Bitcoin Sparrow Wallet, added that privacy and profits don\u2019t always go hand-in-hand. While the cypherpunks, advocates who want social change via cryptographic tools, want people to have private interactions. Institutions care about their bottom line, \u201cSometimes these goals will align, sometimes they will not,\u201d Raw said.\n\n\u201cWhat is key to the cypherpunks is that individuals can continue to find privacy in the tools regardless of institutional adoption,\u201d he explained. Such tools already exist in the Bitcoin and wider crypto world. There are apps, like CoinJoin, which people use to obfuscate Bitcoin transactions.\n\nThere are already tensions between privacy advocates in the crypto world and authorities: feds last year banned U.S. citizens from using the Tornado Cash app, a \u2018coin mixer\u2019 which allows users make private transactions on the Ethereum network; America\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Coinbase then slammed the government\u2019s reasoning for doing so and has since funded a lawsuit against the Treasury department.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLarry Fink, BlackRock CEO, says crypto \"is digitizing gold\" and \"#Bitcoin is an international asset.\" pic.twitter.com/et1nT4c3FZ \u2014 Real Vision (@RealVision) July 6, 2023\n\nThe idea that traditional finance entering the crypto world isn\u2019t necessarily good is not a new one.\n\nCustodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long said back in 2018 that while such a product could be good for the industry, the financialization of the crypto world could be bad if it leads to too much liquidity from leveraged traders wanting quick, short-term gains entering the market.\n\nThis in turn could push long-term HOLDers to \u201cresist it simply by keeping their coins away from the financial system.\u201d\n\nAnalysts right now say that\u2014for better or worse\u2014it\u2019s now just a matter of time before a Bitcoin ETF hits Wall Street. JP Morgan has even said it could happen before Christmas. The product is likely to lead to a ton of money flooding into the space\u2014but will Bitcoin keep its original qualities?\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Warren Buffett may still view cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin (BTC) as \u201crat poison squared,\u201d but he is generating big profits from his position in a crypto-friendly bank in 2023.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s \u201ccrypto bet\u201d up $130 million in 2023\n\nThe \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d purchased 107 million shares of Nu Holdings, a Brazil-based fintech company and owner of the crypto-friendly Nubank, via his firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in two separate rounds in 2021.\n\nBerkshire invested $500 million in Nu Holdings in June 2021 and raised its stake by another $250 million in December 2021. The firm has not sold a single share since, according to its second quarter 2023 earnings report.\n\nNu\u2019s share price is currently up nearly 106% year-to-date (YTD), meaning Buffett\u2019s $750 million position is now worth around $879.50 million, assuming Berkshire has still not sold any of its Nu shares. However, at its peak in February 2022, the position was worth over $1 billion.\n\nNu daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nWhy is Nubank crypto-friendly?\n\nNubank has been dubbed crypto-friendly because some of its divisions offer crypto-related services to over 1.35 million users. Therefore, investing in Nubank can be seen as having indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThat includes Easynvest, a trading platform that offers a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) product, and Nubank, a digital financial services platform that offers BTC and Ether (ETH) trading. Nubank also launched a loyalty token on the Polygon blockchain.\n\nMoreover, Nu Holdings allocated 1% of its cash holdings to Bitcoin in May 2022.\n\n\u201cThis move reinforces the company\u2019s conviction in Bitcoin\u2019s current and future potential in disrupting financial services in the region,\u201d Nubank stated at the time.\n\nNubank is the largest fintech bank in Latin America, with over 80 million customers in Brazil.\n\nNu crushes Apple and Amazon stocks\n\nUnderperforming Nu stocks are Buffett\u2019s other top holdings, Amazon and Apple, which have gained 54.65% and 36%, respectively. Apple is by far the biggest holding of Berkshire Hathaway, comprising roughly 45% of its $354 billion investment portfolio as of September 2023.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin continues to outperform Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio, and the gap is set to widen\n\nNu has also outperformed Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stock, which has risen 9.25% YTD.\n\nNu vs. Amazon, Apple and Berkshire Hathaway YTD performance chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin price performance catches up with Nu stock\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin has finally caught up to the price performance of Nu stock this year. In fact, BTC price is now also up 106% YTD amid \u201cUptober\u201d and recent Bitcoin ETF euphoria.\n\nNu vs. BTC/USD YTD performance chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInterestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s rapid rise to catch up with Nu over the past weeks has coincided with BTC decoupling from the stock market in October.\n\nBut while this is generally seen as a bullish sign, some commentators argue that Bitcoin ETF \u201chopium\u201d is the driver of BTC price gains presently.\n\nIndeed. Lots of historical data that shows bitcoin is tightly correlated to the stock market. The recent \u201cdecoupling\u201d is driven imo by hopium over the ETF.

Pal\u2019s X post highlighted the correlation between the rising fiat market supply and the start of the crypto bull run.\n\nPal, in an X (formerly Twitter) post, shared a graph comparing Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) yearly performance against the global M2 money supply, indicating the simultaneous rise of Bitcoin and global M2 supply. Historically, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets have started outperforming the traditional financial markets with a rise in global M2 supply.\n\nBitcoin vs. global M2 supply.

However, the halving is not the sole factor behind the surge, as several macroeconomic factors also play a key role.\n\nOver the past decade, Bitcoin\u2019s price has made significant gains during the fast growth of M2, owing to a reduction in interest rates, quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus. On the contrary, during times of monetary tightening by central banks, the cryptocurrency market has struggled to gain bullish momentum.

        "content": "Today marks 15 years since the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, shared the Bitcoin white paper to a mailing list of cryptographers on Oct. 31, 2008 \u2014 a date also annually celebrated as Halloween.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on a new electronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party,\u201d Satoshi famously said in the opening sentence before linking the document titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d\n\nSatoshi\u2019s email notifying other cypherpunks about their release of the Bitcoin white paper.

Transactions would be initiated and completed by a broadcast message to all participants, which would update the account balances of those involved in a specific transaction.\n\nIn many ways, it could be seen as a precursor to the nodes of Bitcoin\u2019s protocol, which keep a record of the constantly growing blockchain.\n\nThis process requires proof-of-work, a form of cryptographic proof in which one party proves to others that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended.\n\nSatoshi implemented this into Bitcoin, citing Adam Back\u2019s invention of Hashcash in 1997, which incorporated proof-of-work to limit email spam and denial-of-service attacks.\n\nThe Cypherpunks and Fathers of #Bitcoin:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Hal Finney: Reusable PoW\n\n\u2022 Adam Back: Hashcash\n\n\u2022 Wei Dai: B-money\n\n\u2022 David Chaum: DigiCash\n\n\u2022 Nick Szabo: BitGold\n\n\u2022 Phil Zimmermann: PGP\n\n\u2022 Bram Cohen: BitTorrent\n\n\u2022 Tim May: Crypto Anarchist Manifesto\n\n\n\nAnd Satoshi Nakamoto: Bitcoin \u2014 Crypto Leroy (@TheBitLeroy) June 27, 2020\n\nTimestamps are another core property of Bitcoin, which was successfully implemented by Satoshi.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s timestamp server works by taking a hash \u2014 akin to a unique serial number \u2014 of a block of transactions and timestamping it when the block is added to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nThe hashes cryptographically link one block to the next, ensuring the integrity of Bitcoin data. Timestamps also prevent double spending on Bitcoin, making the network tamper-proof and immutable.\n\nSatoshi cited work from Henri Massias, Scott Stornetta, Stuart Haber and Dave Bayer in implementing timestamping into Bitcoin\u2019s protocol.\n\nMeanwhile, Merkle trees were implemented into Bitcoin to verify transaction data through digital signatures.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWith the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF seemingly in sight, it has seemed like the entire crypto industry is optimistic about how such a product could bolster Bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy in the investing world, ignite institutional adoption, and send the price of BTC to the moon.\n\nFor the most part, that includes Bitcoin mining firms\u2014companies that run large computer fleets dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network and earning newly minted coins. However, a key fact about the current Bitcoin investing landscape may leave investors in mining firms a bit concerned.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic about the ETFs, and there are indications it will be positive,\u201d Isaac Holyoak, CleanSpark's Chief Communications Officer, told Decrypt. Mining stocks, he noted, tend to inherit Bitcoin\u2019s positive momentum during bullish periods.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough Bitcoin itself is up over 100% this year, public mining stocks have averaged even stronger returns \u2013 alongside other BTC-adjacent firms. Until now, such companies have acted as regulated, more traditional leverage plays on BTC for investors in the absence of an ETF.\n\nYet therein lies the rub: Though Bitcoin ETFs may appear promising, they may also suck capital away from stocks that investors have until now treated as the next best thing.\n\nFor their part, CleanSpark remains optimistic, keeping its focus on Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cRecent developments\u2014both the false claim of an ETF and the hinting of one with the CUSIP listing\u2014both spurred an increase in the price of bitcoin,\u201d highlighted Holoyak.\n\nSince most of a mining firm\u2019s revenue stems from fixed BTC block rewards, a rising BTC price translates to higher USD-denominated revenue for the entire industry.\n\nAnticipating higher future prices, Cleanspark has been dumping millions of dollars into mining equipment this year to give it the greatest competitive edge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn an October mining industry report shared with Decrypt, J.P. Morgan equity analyst Reginald L. Smith labeled CleanSpark (CLSK) an overweight stock, thanks to having acquired hardware and facilities at \u201cdeeply discounted prices,\u201d and running a highly efficient fleet. CLSK is up 122% year to date.\n\nAnother firm to make major infrastructure investments this year is Iris Energy (IREN)\u2014a renewable-focused miner that\u2019s particularly bullish on the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Smith also rated Iris shares, which are up 161% this year, as \u201coverweight.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The halving] historically involved an additional price catalyst as coins become even scarcer,\u201d said Daniel Robert, co-founder and co-CEO of Iris Energy. \u201cAdd in a potential easing of macro monetary conditions over the next 6-12 months and we could be in for a very interesting period for Bitcoin.\"\n\nRegarding an ETF, Roberts noted that SEC approval could open \u201csubstantial pools\u201d of capital to the Bitcoin market, compounding with bullish effects from the halving and easing macro conditions.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF differs from existing Bitcoin investment products in the United States, in that its shares would be directly redeemable for a fixed amount of BTC held by the provider and its partners.\n\n\u201cA spot ETF would be infinitely preferable to the fund options on the market today,\u201d explained HIVE Digital CEO Aydin Kilic to Decrypt. \u201cIt would unlock this asset class for professional investors and retail retirement accounts.\u201d\n\nOne of the primary options in the stock market today is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has high fees and doesn't accurately track the price of Bitcoin.\n\nShares in the trust currently trade at a discount to the fund\u2019s underlying BTC holdings. This discount has narrowed over time as confidence grows that the fund\u2019s efforts to convert into a spot Bitcoin ETF will prove successful, and will vanish entirely if/when approved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile some might prefer to purchase and personally hold BTC outright, many retail investors may be less comfortable with buying coins from crypto-specific platforms, which are often unregulated. Furthermore, as Iris\u2019s Roberts elaborated, physical Bitcoin investment is outright impossible for many larger firms.\n\n\u201cBoth institutional investment mandates, as well as those of general retail stockbroking services, often prohibit investment of client capital outside specifically defined instruments and securities,\u201d he said. \u201cAn ETF is likely to solve this.\u201d\n\nAfter GBTC, some of these options include the crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN.;+120% YTD) and the futures-based ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO; +64% YTD). Beyond them, however, are the more than dozen publicly traded miners that have performed well against Bitcoin\u2014so far.\n\nIn a podcast interview this week, J.P. Morgan\u2019s Smith highlighted Marthon Digital and Riot Platforms\u2014two of the largest Bitcoin mining companies\u2014as indirect Bitcoin investments that may be inferior to an ETF.\n\n\u201cIt gives you a cleaner play on Bitcoin than buying Riot or Marathon,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that type of purchase you\u2019re dealing with hashrate, outages, things like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt also could introduce a whole other realm of arbitrage opportunities, where maybe it's cheaper to buy Bitcoin outright and lever up versus buying indirectly through one of the miners,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked about this dynamic, Bitcoin mining firm and pool operator Foundry acknowledged how an ETF could produce \u201ccounterintuitive negative consequences\u201d for the industry.\n\n\u201cOver the past few years, mining companies have been used as proxies to get access to Bitcoin exposure in the public markets,\u201d said Alex Altman, CFA and Senior Manager of Corporate Development at Foundry. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how these new ETF vehicles will impact public miner valuations as investors will now have a more direct, cost-effective way to access the asset class.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

The upcoming US Federal Reserve interest rate decision has the potential to make or break Bitcoin\u2019s price rally.\n\nAltcoins like Ethereum will probably follow Bitcoin\u2019s coattails. A vast majority of market participants expect the interest rate to remain unchanged and a small percentage anticipate a rate cut by the US central bank.\n\nAlso read: Federal Reserve Preview: Powell set to lift US Dollar by leaving door open to more hikes\n\nUS Fed interest rate preview: Two scenarios for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices\n\nScenario 1: US Fed leaves rates unchanged\n\nAccording to the CME Fed Watch Tool, there is a 98% probability that the US Ccentral bank will leave interest rates unchanged on November 1. In September 2023, Bitcoin price noted no stark movements as the Fed left interest rates unchanged. A similar outcome is expected, in response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s November 1 decision.\n\nCME Fed Watch tool and expectation of interest rate hike\n\nBitcoin price could witness short-term volatility, with BTC hovering close to the $34,400 level. BTC is likely to momentarily retrace its weekly gains of 4.33%, a recovery in the asset\u2019s price could follow soon after.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally is largely driven by the anticipation of a spot BTC ETF approval by the US financial regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC\u2019s decision could therefore influence BTC price directly, as opposed to unchanged interest rates.\n\nScenario 2: US Fed cuts interest rates\n\nMarket participants believe that there is a 1.8% probability of an interest rate cut. In the event of a rate cut, risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins are expected to rally. Typically, a rate cut makes it cheaper to borrow funds and engage in leveraging risk assets like Bitcoin for gains. An increase in demand and inflow of funds to the asset likely drive prices higher.\n\nIt is important to note that the interest rate cut is highly unlikely. Investors are focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech to identify whether more interest rate hikes are on the horizon.\n\nExpert analysis on likelihood of further rate hikes\n\nYohay Elam, lead analyst at FXStreet analyzed the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision and the possibility of future rate hikes in his post here. Elam notes that the Federal Reserve's overnight rate stands at a range of 5.25%-5.50%, above both measures of inflation. The US Central bank has slowed the pace of its rate hikes and settled for one interest rate increase in the past three meetings.\n\nWhile market participants expect another \u201cno change\u201d decision from the US Fed, the Central bank left room for another hike in 2023. Elam says,\n\n\u201cThe bank's dot plot showed a target of 5.6% by year-end, leaving the door open to another move. With no new forecasts at this juncture, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely insist on another move, leaving his options open. One reason to do that is the buoyant jobs market.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum prices hover at crucial levels\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are hovering around crucial levels, ahead of the bank\u2019s decision on Wednesday. Bitcoin price sustained above $34,400 while Ethereum is trading above its $1,800 psychological level."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin's price could surge to $150,000 by 2025, according to a new prediction by investment research firm Bernstein.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani cited optimism around the potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the next two years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a report from CNBC, Chhugani wrote in the note that he believes the SEC will likely approve a Bitcoin ETF in the first quarter of 2024. His prediction echoes that of JP Morgan analysts, who say there's a 90% chance investors get an BTC fund before January 10.\n\nBernstein, along with most other Wall Street firms, had ruled out BTC as an investment asset in 2018. But the company was still paying attention by tracking Bitcoin mining companies and publishing its own take on the contagion that spread from firm to firm in mid-2022.\n\nNow, the firm says, a Bitcoin ETF would allow mainstream investors to gain exposure to BTC directly from their portfolios for the first time via an SEC-regulated investment product. Currently, the only similar product is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which holds around 3% of outstanding BTC supply.\n\nThe $150,000 target is nearly five times Bitcoin's current price of around $34,000 and more than double its all-time high of $67,000 from November 2021. If realized, Bernstein's lofty prediction would signify a massive turnaround for the cryptocurrency from its steep sell-off last year.\n\nBitcoin has rallied recently, reaching $35,000 last week for the first time since May 2022. Investors are increasingly hopeful the SEC will approve a Bitcoin ETF after declining to appeal a court ruling in Grayscale's lawsuit. However, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been highly critical of the crypto industry, so whether regulators will embrace a Bitcoin ETF remains uncertain.\n\nBernstein also noted the upcoming \"halving\" event in 2024 will help boost BTC's price by forcing out inefficient miners. The firm initiated coverage on several BTC mining stocks, expecting the survivors to see significant gains.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was written with the assistance of AI.

        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) educator based in Tanzania has scaled Africa\u2019s highest peak, Kilimanjaro, financing the entire trip through Bitcoin and Nostr donations.\n\nKweks poses with a Bitcoin and NOSTR flag at the summit of Kilimanjaro. Source: X (formerly Twitter)\n\nKweks (not his real name) crowdfunded over $1,700 in Bitcoin (0.0018 BTC) to cover the costs of the hike, which doubled as an announcement for a new Bitcoin education academy in Tanzania.\n\nKweks and his wife recently moved to a new city in Tanzania to open a learning center called the \u201cProof of Work Academy,\u201d or POWA. Kweks told Cointelegraph that while POWA is a pun on Bitcoin\u2019s consensus protocol, proof-of-work, it also refers to the Zwahili word \u201cPoah,\u201d which means fresh or cool.\n\nTo promote the new school and subtly hint at his affinity for decentralized protocols, including Bitcoin and Nostr (notes and other stuff transmitted by relay), Kweks funded the ascent to nearly 6,000 meters in satoshis or sats, which are the smallest denomination of Bitcoin equal to 100 millionth of 1 BTC.\n\nBitcoin Lightning Network donations streamed in from all around the world via crowdfunding on Geyser Fund and through Zapraising, which is Bitcoin Lightning Network crowdfunding via Nostr (also called Zaps.)\n\nThe moment Kweks reached the fundraising milestone. Source: X\n\nKweks carried and waved a giant Nostr flag while sharing status updates throughout the multiday hike on X, Nostr and WhatsApp. Speaking from Tanzania, Kweks explained to Cointelegraph that while the money raised was meaningful to cover the costs of the climb, the impact was primarily educational:\n\n\u201cI thought it [the ascent] would be a great case study to show what Bitcoin can do and then introduce some people to Bitcoin as well.\u201d\n\nThe ascent demonstrated to his local community that a global base of Nostriches (users of Nostr) and generous Bitcoin advocates worldwide were happy to support Kweks\u2019 climb and educational work on the ground in Tanzania.\n\nPlus, Kweks received a tip from one of the guides leading the party to the summit of \u201cKili,\u201d as it\u2019s known locally, showing that there is grassroots Bitcoin adoption in Tanzania.\n\nThere is, evidently, some understanding of Bitcoin in Tanzania, Kweks explained \u2014 but one of the key challenges is off-ramps into local currency. The likes of Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini do not operate in Tanzania, so swapping cash for Bitcoin and vice versa can be challenging.\n\nThroughout the hike, Kweks received questions and curious comments from Tanzanians about how he funded the adventure and the inevitable query: \u201cWhat is Bitcoin?\u201d\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin adoption in Tanzania is very different from the United Kingdom, where Kweks spent 25 years of his life before moving to Tanzania.\n\nRelated: Hashing It Out: What happens when crypto meets fintech in Africa?\n\nThere is, he explains, more of a barter system in place in East Africa. It can be a challenge to explain money and hyperinflation and the reasons why a currency with a programmed inflation rate, such as Bitcoin could offer an alternative economic system to society.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived in Tanzania ten years ago, $1 was 1,500 hundred Tanzanian shillings. As of today, [$1 equals] 2,600. That\u2019s ten years later. It\u2019s crazy!\u201d\n\nUltimately, the key to unlocking Bitcoin education is to use terms relevant to people: \u201cI do speak to them about how much bread is going up and how much fuel is going up, and they understand that,\u201d Kweks explained.\n\n\u201cThey see that it\u2019s harder to make ends meet. So with these concepts, they understand that Bitcoin the tool can help them \u2014 and that\u2019s the work. That\u2019s the work that needs to be shared and explored.\u201d\n\nKweks continues to post and share educational resources on Nostr and X, while the educational resource POWA offers free educational classes to Tanzanians based near Kilimanjaro.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens continued their bullish momentum in the new week on Monday. All the crypto tokens stepped in the early trades, continuing the weekend momentum. The euphoria around regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing helped the crypto surge lately.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to remain firm as the largest crypto token gained about a per cent and managed to hover strongly above 34,000-levels. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was also seen half a per cent each but remained below $1,800-level. Majority of the altcoins were trading with gains.\n\n\n\nBitcoin sustained its position above the $34,000 threshold, driven by the prevailing positive outlook regarding the potential approval of Bitcoin Spot ETF applications in the United States, said Edul Patel, Co-Founder & CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) witnessed its second-largest trading week to date, racking up $1.7 billion in trading volume, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded $800 million in trading volume, possibly amplifying the overall market's positive sentiment. Ethereum, on the other hand, maintained its trading value above $1,700,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll of the majority of top crypto tokens were trading higher on Monday. Solana surged about per cent, while Chainlink and Polkadot gained 3 per cent each. Polygon, Cardano and XRP gained about 2 per cent each in the early trade. Even the dollar pegged stablecoins inched up.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.26 trillion-mark, as it jumped about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 13 per cent to $27.37 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin concluded the week with a remarkable 15 per cent gain. Throughout the weekend, BTC maintained a positive stance but remained below its local resistance at $35,000. Currently, the price hovers around $34,300, while ETH is trading slightly above the local support level of $1,765, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"It's worth noting that this week carries significant weight for the crypto market due to various macro events, including the US FOMC meeting, the monthly announcement of the US unemployment rate, US job openings, and the US non-farm Employment Change. These events have the potential to introduce volatility to the crypto market,\" it added.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nChainlink (LINK) is currently in a major rally on the back of RWA (Real world assets) narrative and wider positive sentiment in the market. The token has been on the sidelines for most of 2022 and 2023 but recently saw a considerable surge in price. LINK went from $5.9 in early September to $11.2 today, a 90% surge in price.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-Chainlink\n\n\n\nThe token has broken the $10 key resistance level, and continued strong development is likely. The Bollinger Bands are currently wide as the price volatility increases near the $9 mark and the price action is trending well above the indicator\u2019s mean line. The upward shift has propelled the RSI index to the overbought territory and is currently sitting at 76.9. If the price manages to successfully surpass the $12 mark, this could lead to further increase towards the resistance level of $13.5.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $10, $9, $7.85\n\nResistance: $12, $13.5\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

The widespread expectation is that the Fed will maintain the existing interest rate, fostering positive sentiment across financial markets, including the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nNotably, institutional interest in Bitcoin is on the rise. In September, Bitcoin-centric products made up 73.3 percent of the market. Their assets under management (AUM) grew by 11.1 percent, totaling $23.2 billion.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Weekly Surge & Market Events\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC) showcased a stellar week, ending with a notable 15% uptick.

Immediate barriers are at $34,500, then $35,250 and $36,150.\n\nOn the flip side, anticipated support is at $33,000, coinciding with the 38.2% Fibonacci level, with subsequent levels at $32,450 and $31,800, which match the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci marks.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s graphical trends show strength above a double bottom foundation at $33,450, safeguarded by the 23.6% Fibonacci mark against major declines.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum prices lift on ETF hopes while JPM coin\u2019s daily transactions exceed $1 billion\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) surged at the beginning of the past week, moving from around $30,600 to over $34,500 and has since shifted sideways to now remain at that level.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalisation, moved in a similar way, starting the week off at around $1,650 and jumping to a $1,850 high before enduring a small correction to now trade at $1,815.\n\nThe prices of most digital assets surged over the week after it was revealed that BlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) had been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which provides post-trading clearing, settlement, custody, and information services for Nasdaq.\n\nIt was revealed shortly after, however, that the ETF had been listed on the DTCC\u2019s website since August. The move was nevertheless interpreted as a signal that the ETF could get approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the near future, boosting prices, to the point that BTC reached $35,919 on OKX.\n\nAs a result Bitcoin short sellers lost nearly $180 million over 24 hours, showing how strong demand for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US appears to be. Backing that up, a recent report from crypto forensics firm Chainalysis revealed that the largest market in the cryptocurrency world is North America, with an estimated transaction volume of $1.2 trillion between July 2022 and June 2023.\n\nPer the report, North America\u2019s crypto transactions account for 24.4% of the total and are driven by institutional activity, with large transactions of over $1 million or more making up 76.9% of its total volume. Decentralised finance and centralized exchange, the report notes, share the region\u2019s on-chain activity.\n\nElliptic debunks claims of Hamas raising millions in crypto\n\nBlockchain forensics firm Elliptic has over the week clarified that the numbers that are being used to show how much crypto Hamas has raised aren\u2019t correct, noting there\u2019s little evidence showing terrorist groups are using digital assets effectively.\n\nElliptic said that Hamas started asking for Bitcoin donations in 2019, but stopped all public crypto fundraising in April. It said that Hamas was worried about the safety of donors using crypto. Per Ellitpic, only about $21,000 in crypto donations were sent to Hamas following its attack on Israel on October 7.\n\nThe possible use of cryptocurrencies by terrorist organisations gained attention earlier this month after the Wall Street Journal reported, using Elliptic data, that Hamas and other militant groups raised millions in crypto before launching its attack on Israel. The report was cited by more than 100 US lawmakers.\n\nElliptic clarified that there\u2019s no evidence suggesting \u201cthat crypto fundraising has raised anything close to this amount, and data provided by Elliptic and others has been misinterpreted.\n\nChainalysis has itself in a separate report that claims of millions of dollars in crypto being moved to fund Hamas\u2019 operations are likely to be \u201coverstated\u201d.\n\nJPMorgan moves more than $1 billion daily with its JPM coin\n\nJPM Coin, the digital asset launched by JPMorgan in 2020, is being used for over $1 billion in daily transactions, according to the company\u2019s global head of payments, Takis Georgakopoulos.\n\nGeorgakopoulos said that current payment systems are slow, especially for cross-border transactions. He also said that they separate money and information, which makes tracking and reconciling transactions difficult, and reduces the fungibility of money.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles III, King of the United Kingdom and the 14 other Commonwealth realms, has approved a bill that will help law enforcement agencies confiscate and freeze cryptocurrency that has been used for crime.\n\nIn the US, Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has argued that the Securities and Exchange Commission has overstepped its authority when it classified cryptocurrencies it listed as securities.\n\nCoinbase said in a recent court document that it wants to end the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against it. In it, the firm claimed the regulator\u2019s definition of a security was too broad and disputed that the cryptocurrencies the exchange offers were not within the SEC\u2019s authority.\n\nOver in Europe, Binance announced it will end its Visa debit card services in the European Economic Area (EEA) on December 20 over a decision from the card issuer, Contis Financial System.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

In fact, it is this name \u201cYHWH\u201d (\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4) which implies something like \u201cthe breaths of the Creator who spoke the world into existence.\u201d Christians may recognize this as \u201cYahweh\u201d Or \u201cJehovah.\u201d This name for the Creator also appears in the common word of praise: \u201cHallelujah!\u201c\n\nHebrew scholars will criticize my reductionism here (and I will encourage you to spend some time studying the Hebrew language and numerology so you can criticize me too,) but the name contains the jots and tittles that signify breathe itself, and it\u2019s those heavily breathed words which \u201clet there be light\u201d to all of reality. So, in short, it can be said that the number 15 and its breath is actually the formula for creation itself.\n\nConsidering the seismic shifts that Bitcoin has triggered in our economic systems and the probability that the Bitcoin white paper was written through spoken word dictation, the divine grace of 15 years feels especially poignant.\n\nSmall blockers\u2019 wet blanket\n\nTo douse the magic of the Creator, James Donald was the first person to respond to Nakamoto on Halloween 2008, and his response came with a skepticism now symbolizing an enduring clash between different visions for Bitcoin. Donald expressed concern about scalability, arguing that every user needed to run a full node for the network to function. Satoshi, however, saw a future less confined to such limitations and laughed off the first small blocker. Fifteen years later, the debate rages on, with innovations and divisions coloring the landscape of blockchain assets.\n\nOctober 31: A day of reformation\n\nOctober 31 holds a rich tapestry of cultural and historical significance. The ancient Gaelic festival Samhain, All Hallow\u2019s Eve, All Saints Day, and Martin Luther\u2019s Ninety-Five Theses in 1517 all share this date. Each revolutionized human thought in their own right\u2014from the convergence of old-world and new-world spiritual beliefs to the decentralization of church governance. Satoshi likely chose October 31 for its symbolic value, aligning Bitcoin with a long history of paradigm shifts.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s all of that or none of that\u2014taking in this recollection of pain from Bitcoin\u2019s troubled creator.\n\nMy father told me I would never succeed. 31 Oct is his birthday. Now you know why I released bitcoin that day. Happy birthday dad. Fu. \u2014 Dr Craig S Wright (@Dr_CSWright) October 31, 2022\n\nCentralization to Decentralization: Bitcoin\u2019s promise\n\nWhen Bitcoin\u2019s white paper was released, it proposed a peer-to-peer system for \u201cCommerce on the Internet.\u201d Its distributed and competitive structure promised to lower transaction costs, making micropayments not just feasible but efficient. The launch in January 2009 saw the genesis block contain extra text data stating \u201cChancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks,\u201d emphasizing the need for a more equitable system or maybe just the value of time-stamped data on a public ledger\u2014depending on who you ask.\n\nJust as All Saints\u2019 Eve combined elements from Christian and pagan traditions to become Halloween, Bitcoin absorbs and amplifies best practices from the financial systems that preceded it\u2014mixing the best powers of gold and cash with the magic of the internet. Yet, it also sidesteps most of their shortcomings, introducing a level of transparency and fairness hitherto unimaginable.\n\nHowever, so much of Bitcoin\u2019s promise seems far off in the aether in a perpetual place of \u201csomeday soon\u201d as the acts of the Bitcoin Civil War trudge forward and the businesses that use Bitcoin fail to be truly sticky in the new economy. May Bitcoin be realized so that our fallen world can be set back in place to continue forward the quest for economic fairness and transparency.\n\n15 years on: The road ahead\n\nAs we celebrate this significant 15-year mark, we must remain attuned to the need for continued innovation and vigilance against the forces of obfuscation and centralization. The spirit of October 31\u2014a day of transformation\u2014must continue to inspire the Bitcoin world. After all, 15 years in the world of technology is both an eternity and a fleeting moment.\n\nThe challenge now is to keep the essence of Satoshi\u2019s vision intact for the next 15 years and beyond.\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Whitepaper Section One: The Introduction\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "IF THERE\u2019S one thing that crypto enthusiasts love more than the digital assets themselves, it\u2019s memes. A frenzy of crypto-based memes have gained fresh momentum last week as Bitcoin rallied.\n\nGrowing expectations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will authorise exchange-traded funds that invest directly in Bitcoin pushed the largest crypto by market value up by more than 25 per cent over the past two weeks to around US$35,000 on Wednesday (Oct 25) \u2013 its highest level in about 18 months. The breakout gives bulls some hope even as reminders of the industry\u2019s recent woes linger. Just last week, Sam Bankman-Fried took the stand in his own defence of criminal charges stemming from the collapse of his crypto exchange FTX. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMemecoins such as Pepe Coin surged along with Bitcoin. The coin based on the Internet meme of a green anthropomorphic frog that has been around since the early 2000s increased 77 per cent on Friday from the week before, according to data from crypto market tracker CoinGecko. Pepe Coin, which was issued this year, soared to a market value of more than US$1 billion in May before reversing course and plummeting more than 60 per cent in the following days, according to data tracker CoinMarketCap.\n\n\u201cThe bear market put a dampener on meme activity, especially in terms of market value, but it stayed quite lively anyway,\u201d Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said. \u201cNow that sentiment is feeling more confident, the meme tokens will come to represent even more the fun, Yolo side of crypto investing.\u201d\n\nMemes, from Baby Yoda to Bob Ross, have been a part of the cryptocurrency space since its early beginnings \u2013 and in 2013, they began trading as digital tokens known as memecoins. Dogecoin, often cited as the first memecoin, was valued at as much as US$50 billion in 2021, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.com. Dogecoin ascended to stardom when Elon Musk tweeted memes based on the coin, inspiring other dog-themed memecoins such as Shiba Inu. Now, there are hundreds of memecoins that range from being worth almost nothing to having market values of US$100 million or more.\n\n\u201cCrypto attracts rebels who believe that money is not serious, legacy systems aren\u2019t to be trusted, the future is uncertain and those in charge are corrupt, so they might as well have fun,\u201d Acheson said.\n\nSEE ALSO MicroStrategy launches second note sale this month to buy more Bitcoin\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU Monday, 3.30 PM Garage The hottest news on all things startup and tech to kickstart your week. Sign Up We have other newsletters you might enjoy. Take a look.\n\nThis is not the first time that memecoins are in lockstep with overall market sentiment. During the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the most popular memes, \u201cmoney printer go brrr\u201d, was about how the Federal Reserve was \u201cprinting\u201d an endless amount of US dollars and how that enhanced the value of Bitcoin, which has a capped amount of tokens. The demise of that meme came in October 2022, leaving the average investor caring little whether there is a finite amount of the digital asset.\n\n\u201cWe can roll our eyes at these tokens\u2019 lack of fundamental value, but in my opinion that overlooks that, in the end, the market decides,\u201d Acheson said. \u201cMeme tokens are cultural expressions with monetary value, and in the crypto market there will always be a degree of eager participation.\u201d BLOOMBERG"
