        "title": "What Grayscale's Victory in Bitcoin Case Means for Crypto Market - Bloomberg Law",
        "content": "The US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit grabbed the attention of legal and crypto communities when it ruled, in Grayscale Investments v. SEC, that the agency had acted unlawfully in denying Grayscale\u2019s application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund or ETF.\n\nAlthough the decision was a significant win for Grayscale and the crypto industry, commentators may have missed important nuance. The decision appears to reflect a technical application of standard administrative law doctrine\u2014and perhaps not, as commentators have assumed, a blanket rebuke of the SEC\u2019s reluctance to embrace crypto.\n\nGrayscale Decision\n\nThe case stems from the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s application to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, versus a Bitcoin futures ETF, on a national exchange. An ETF is an investment vehicle designed to track an asset\u2019s value. While spot ETFs hold the asset itself, other ETFs hold derivates such as futures, which are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a later date.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision teed up a quintessential administrative law issue: whether the agency\u2019s action was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d and therefore unlawful, under the Administrative Procedure Act or APA.\n\nIn a unanimous opinion, a three-judge panel ruled that the SEC\u2019s action was indeed arbitrary and capricious, as the agency\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF couldn\u2019t be squared with the agency\u2019s prior approvals of Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nAccording to the panel, the SEC\u2019s inconsistent treatment of the products violated a bedrock principle of administrative law: An agency must treat like cases alike.\n\nAlthough the SEC had attempted to thread the needle between them\u2014noting that Bitcoin futures ETFs enjoy superior market-surveillance and fraud-detection mechanisms compared with spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2014the panel rejected the SEC\u2019s proffered distinctions.\n\nFor both products, the panel observed, the relevant surveillance-sharing agreements were identical and equally likely to detect fraud. The panel also highlighted the SEC\u2019s failure to explain why fraud in the spot Bitcoin market was no obstacle to approving Bitcoin futures ETFs but was a basis to reject spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSignificant But Limited Victory\n\nSoon after, commentators celebrated the Grayscale decision as a resounding rebuke of the SEC\u2019s reluctance to embrace, if not hostility toward, the crypto industry. They particularly emphasized the panel\u2019s unanimity.\n\nThe opinion\u2019s Trump-appointed author, Judge Neomi Rao, had joined an Obama-appointee, Judge Sri Srinivasan, and a Carter appointee, Judge Harry Edwards, to rein in the SEC and safeguard crypto from the agency\u2019s power grab. Reports also seized on the harsh phrase that the panel had repeatedly employed to describe the SEC\u2019s conduct: \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThen again, to quote former D.C. Circuit Judge Abner Mikva, \u201c\u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 is a term of art in the hands of a reviewing court and has connotations less pejorative than the plain meaning of the words would suggest.\u201d\n\nThe APA\u2019s arbitrary-and-capricious review, as US Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained, requires a court to \u201censure[] that the agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the decision.\u201d\n\nPut simply by former Justice Byron White, the standard\u2019s touchstone is \u201creasoned decision-making.\u201d Across a broad array of subjects, courts have routinely applied this familiar formula to strike down agency actions as \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nFrom this perspective, the decision may not represent the resounding legal and political rout that the crypto community has deemed it. The case was technical, narrow, and the latest in a series of decisions reflecting methodical and dispassionate applications of APA arbitrary-and-capricious review.\n\nThe three panelists here\u2014Judges Rao, Srinivasan, and Edwards\u2014are known for their scholarly approaches to appellate judging and deep expertise in administrative law.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nThe SEC may petition for a rehearing with all the D.C. Circuit\u2019s judges. But such en banc review requires a majority vote and is warranted only to \u201cmaintain the uniformity of the court\u2019s decisions\u201d or to resolve \u201cquestions of exceptional importance.\u201d It\u2019s doubtful the panelists\u2019 peers would view this straightforward case as a worthy candidate.\n\nThe SEC may also petition the Supreme Court for certiorari review. But even assuming that the panel erred, the court isn\u2019t in the business of mere error correction, and the decision\u2014a run-of-the-mill application of the APA\u2014doesn\u2019t appear to raise an issue that would move the court to exercise its jealously guarded certiorari jurisdiction. Nothing is certain, however.\n\nIf the SEC doesn\u2019t appeal the decision, it must comply. Yet the agency has room to maneuver. For example, the SEC could approve all spot Bitcoin ETF applications simultaneously\u2014not only Grayscale\u2019s, but also its competitors\u2019\u2014thus defeating any first-mover advantage.\n\nOr the SEC could deny Grayscale\u2019s application on an alternative ground. The SEC could even backtrack on its prior decision to approve Bitcoin futures ETFs. To comply with the equal-treatment principle, an agency need not equalize up\u2014it may also equalize down.\n\nSome of the Grayscale decision\u2019s biggest winners are conventional investors and their financial advisers.\n\nCompared with Bitcoin futures ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs permit investors to avoid roll costs\u2014those generated in a futures market after an investor rolls a short-term contract into a longer-term contract.\n\nAnd compared with directly purchasing Bitcoin, the ability to invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF might assuage investors, and their advisers, who seek exposure to Bitcoin but would find comfort in the familiarity of traditional investing.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.\n\n\n\nAuthor Information\n\nAndrew L.

        "title": "McLennan County resolves Bitcoin settlement after admitting funds seized in \u2018error\u2019 - KWTX",
        "content": "WACO, Texas (KWTX) - McLennan County officials have resolved a lawsuit that claimed sheriff\u2019s investigators unlawfully seized funds from a Bitcoin ATM after an 82-year-old Crawford woman reported scammers convinced her to convert $15,000 into Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\nLux Vending, which does business as Bitcoin Depot, agreed to dismiss the lawsuit and allow the woman to keep her money after McLennan County Judge Scott Felton admitted that the funds were seized \u201cin error\u201d and that it was premature for the sheriff\u2019s office to have returned the money to her.\n\nLux\u2019s lawsuit against the sheriff\u2019s office alleged investigators violated due process procedures when it obtained a search warrant to seize the money from one of its kiosk machines at a Sunoco store at 7500 Bosque Blvd. The suit also asked a judge to declare Bitcoin Depot the rightful owner of the cash.\n\nMcLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara, who said in June that his officers \u201cdid everything right\u201d and that Bitcoin Depot officials \u201ccan go to hell,\u201d declined comment Wednesday about the dismissal of the lawsuit. He also declined comment when asked about Felton\u2019s comments in a letter to Bitcoin Depot\u2019s chief operating officer that said the funds were seized in error.\n\nScott Buchanan, COO for Bitcoin Depot, said in a statement that the company cully cooperated with McLennan County law enforcement throughout the process. Buchanan reiterated Bitcoin Depot\u2019s \u201cdiligence in protecting its customers from illegal activity, cooperating with law enforcement officials to reach a resolution and enacting procedures to help identify and eliminate future bad actors seeking to take advantage of unsuspecting citizens.\u201d\n\nFelton did not respond to messages from KWTX on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe seizure of the money at that time was an error based on a misunderstanding that the funds belonged solely to the customer, not the company,\u201d Felton wrote in a letter to Bitcoin Depo obtained by KWTX. \u201c\u2026Due to the timing of the communication and the return of the funds happening at the same time, the money was not maintained by law enforcement officials and, instead, was provided to the victim.\u201d\n\nFelton wrote that because of a \u201cmisunderstanding and the difficulty in communication,\u201d McLennan County officials were not aware of the company\u2019s terms and conditions. He acknowledged the money no longer legally belonged to the customer at the time the cash was returned.\n\n\u201cThe release of the money to the McLennan County resident was based on a good faith belief that there were no competing claims for the legal interest of the money,\u201d Felton wrote. \u201cOfficials later determined that it was premature to have distributed the money which was seized for \u2018evidentiary purposes.\u2019\u201d\n\nFelton wrote he appreciated the company\u2019s cooperation in trying to identify the scammer.\n\nWaco attorney Mike Dixon, who represents the county, said Bitcoin agreed to dismiss the lawsuit and the woman got to keep her money. The county paid Bitcoin Depot nothing, he said.\n\n\u201cAll Bitcoin wanted was a letter showing they weren\u2019t the bad guys here, that they had procedures and warnings in place to try to stop this from happening and that they tell people not to send Bitcoin to wallets the person does not control,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cSo it was more about making it clear that Bitcoin Depot wasn\u2019t the scammer. This was a third-party international scammer and Bitcoin Depot was helpful in assisting and trying to locate the scammer.\u201d\n\nThe Crawford woman reported the elaborate scam to the sheriff\u2019s office on April 27, and a detective got a search warrant on May 3 to seize the money from the Bitcoin kiosk.\n\nAccording to the search warrant affidavit, the woman said she was online looking up cooking recipes when she received an email with a link to view a recipe. She clicked the link, which the affidavit said appears to have activated a \u201cRansomware\u201d computer virus.\n\nShe contacted \u201ccustomer support\u201d and was transferred to a \u201cfraud investigator,\u201d the affidavit states. She was told all her personal information had been compromised and that the fraud department could help her work through the problem.\n\nThe woman said she should contact her bank and law enforcement but was told it was not necessary because at that point, nothing had happened with her bank account and a \u201ccomputer virus\u201d was not something law enforcement would respond to, according to the affidavit.\n\nNext, the \u201cfraud investigator\u201d asked if she had written a check for a laptop. She said no, and the \u201cfraud investigator\u201d said a check just cleared the bank that someone wrote to pay for a laptop.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018fraud investigator\u2019 then told (the woman) he could see where a check was written to a construction company in the amount of $15,000, which had not cleared yet. (The woman) was then given instructions on how to prevent the loss of this amount of money,\u201d the affidavit states.\n\nThe woman was told to drive to her bank, make a $15,000 cash withdrawal and then go to the store and deposit it into the Bitcoin machine. She said she knew nothing about Bitcoin and told the man she was going to call law enforcement.\n\n\u201c(The woman) said the person on the phone stressed that essentially the longer she took to get the money out of the bank the closer the check could be to clearing,\u201d the affidavit says. \u201c(The woman) said she followed the instructions and that the guy stayed on the phone with her the entire time. (The woman) said she deposited $15,000, $100 at a time.\u201d\n\nMcNamara said in June the issue is no different than his agency recovering stolen cars, guns or four-wheelers and returning them to their rightful owners.\n\nCopyright 2023 KWTX.

        "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Anthony Scaramucci Says Bitcoin Could Hit $150K To $250K On BTC ETF Launch - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The founder of SkyBridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci, is known for many things, including his entrepreneurial endeavors, investment acumen, and a brief stint at the White House.\n\nIn recent years, investors have come to learn that Scaramucci is a big believer in the future of digital assets, specifically Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin could be a hedge against higher inflation and a national debt that has to be monetized, Scaramucci told Benzinga.\n\n\u201cI think those things will have value over time,\u201d he said of Bitcoin and digital assets during a recent appearance on \u201cThe Raz Report.\u201d\n\nScaramucci said, unlike other assets, you can\u2019t inflate away the value of Bitcoin given its fixed supply. The investor said Bitcoin might be the only asset on the planet with higher demand that can\u2019t have the supply increased.\n\n\u201c [If] you have higher demand for gold, we\u2019ll build more mines. Bitcoin has a finite supply.\u201d\n\nScaramucci told Benzinga that he has a couple of hundred million dollars invested in the cryptocurrency space, including holding Bitcoin on the SkyBridge and his own personal balance sheet.\n\nThe investor also partnered with FirstTrust to launch the FirstTrust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF (NYSE: CRPT) in 2021.\n\nThe ETF \u201chas publicly traded companies that are linked to digital assets,\u201d Scaramucci said.\n\nA look at the top holdings shows the following five companies:\n\nMicroStrategy Inc (NYSE: MSTR): 23.9%\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN): 21.2%\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT): 9.2%\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA): 8.4%\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings (OTC: BRPHF): 7.4%\n\nRelated Link: Trump's Former Communication Director Casts Doubt On FTX's Revival\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: Like other Bitcoin investors, Scaramucci is optimistic about the cryptocurrency's potential price surge, a sentiment that could be bolstered by future Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nScaramucci said that nobody knows where the price of Bitcoin is heading, but a look at SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) ETF could illustrate what inflows into Bitcoin ETFs could do. Scaramucci highlighted that when investments poured into the gold ETF, gold's price rose. He suggests that as financial institutions venture into Bitcoin through ETFs, a similar trend might occur.\n\nIf Bitcoin ETFs do $100 billion in allocation to Bitcoin, the price of the cryptocurrency could go to $150,000 or $250,000, Scaramucci added.\n\n\u201cI believe it could.\u201d\n\nScaramucci mentioned many stocks that have gone up by 10x or more in the past and added that Bitcoin going to $150,000 to $250,000 is only a five to eight-bagger. \u201cIf I\u2019m right, we could be sitting at $150k, $250k Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCatch the full episode of Anthony Scaramucci on The Raz Report Friday at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nRead Next: Exclusive: Mark Yusko On Bitcoin's Future, 2024 Price Target\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event - Future of Digital Assets.

        "content": "The high-tech phenomena of crypto-mining is spreading throughout the Natural State, and a recent proposal for a new facility near DeWitt, Arkansas, has locals up in arms.\n\nTuesday morning, the Arkansas County Quorum Court passed an amendment to make a noise ordinance aimed at crypto mines stricter.\n\nThere is a lot of spirit in DeWitt and Arkansas County as a whole, and the potential threats posed by a new crypto mine have brought local outcry to a fever pitch.\n\n\"This affects every single Arkansan in the state of Arkansas. We will no longer be the Natural State; we will be the Bitcoin State,\" said DeWitt business owner Jackie Johnson. \"And this is one of the only states that did not have Bitcoin mining. It's Sarah Huckabee Sanders and our legislature welcomed them [with] open arms. It's something else too, bitcoin miners are not little mom and pop businesses, they are big conglomerates that don't even live in the United States.\n\nWhen it was announced in July that the company Jones Digital planned on constructing a crypto mine next to DeWitt, locals became worried, having heard of crypto mine issues other towns around the state are already facing.\n\nConcerns range from power grid and water usage to environmental threats, hunting and agriculture being essential to the local economy.\n\n\"I'm here representing the farmers here concerning electricity and water. Two vital things that farmers need to survive and make a living. We don't want anything to jeopardize those in any way,\" said Kenneth Graves, chairman of the Arkansas Rice Growers Association.\n\nArkansas' government opened the door for crypto-mining businesses in the state with the recently signed into law Act 851, which severely limits the local government's ability to regulate crypto mines.\n\n\"The rest of the businesses and farmers that are in the area...we have to abide by regulations, we're regulated, we're taxed\u2014and this business is not. They're exempt from sales and use tax, and they're getting a cut-rate from Entergy because of the amount they use,\" said Tami Hornbeck, who owns a coffee shop in DeWitt.\n\n\"It just seems like our rights are being discriminated against and taken away in order for this one business to come in that's not going to provide jobs, it's not going to provide any economic benefit for our community,\" Hornbeck said.\n\nHornbeck and others have started a petition to prevent crypto mines from coming to Arkansas County\u2014after only two weeks, nearly half the town of DeWitt signed it.\n\nWith locals scrambling to find ways to keep out crypto mines, on Tuesday the county's Quorum Court made a noise ordinance (existing before Act 851 went into effect) stricter with an amendment, taking a stand with what may be seen as a violation of the new law.\n\n\"This is a gray area. And I do think there is a chance we will end up in court over this,\" said Tim Blair, prosecuting attorney for Arkansas County.\n\n\n\nDeWitt and other communities around the state facing unwanted crypto mines are asking for the governor to call a special session to re-evaluate Act 851."

        "title": "Top 10 Bitcoin Mining Countries and Their Renewable Electricity - Visual Capitalist",
        "content": "Top 10 Bitcoin Mining Countries & Their Renewable Electricity Mix\n\nBitcoin miners use an estimated 348 terawatt hours of electricity per year, and with the world increasingly moving to renewables, some are asking the question: just where does Bitcoin get its electricity?\n\nTo answer that question, we partnered with HIVE Digital to visualize data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and Ember, a climate-oriented energy think tank, to look at the Bitcoin network\u2019s electricity mix.\n\nThis is part one in our How Green is Bitcoin? series, which examines the cryptocurrency\u2019s sustainability.\n\nThe World According to Bitcoin\n\nThe top 10 countries for Bitcoin mining represent 93.8% of the entire network by hashrate\u2014a measure of computational power\u2014with the U.S., China, and Kazakhstan rounding out the top three. Together these three countries hosted nearly three-quarters of the network at the end of 2021.\n\nCountry Hashrate (%) Renewable (%) U.S. 37.8% 22.5% China 21.1% 30.2% Kazakhstan 13.2% 11.3% Canada 6.5% 69.7% Russia 4.7% 18.5% Germany 3.1% 43.0% Malaysia 2.5% 19.1% Ireland 2.0% 38.6% Singapore 2.0% 2.4% Thailand 1.0% 15.5% Rest of the World 6.3% 30.1%\n\nSource: Hashrate (%): Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance as of December 2021; Renewable (%) Ember, as of 2022.\n\nChina used to be the top spot for Bitcoin mining, up to 75% of global capacity, but a crackdown in the summer of 2021 saw their share drop to nil in just a couple months. Many miners relocated to nearby Kazakhstan, attracted by cheap electricity, loose regulations, and a \u2018stable\u2019 political climate, while others opted for the United States. A sizable covert mining scene has also emerged in China, now that the dust has settled.\n\nAt the bottom of the top 10 are Ireland, Singapore, and Thailand, which together host 4.9% of the network. Ireland\u2019s reported share\u2014and this applies to sixth-place Germany, as well\u2014is thought to be a significant overstatement caused by miners in other countries masking their true locations.\n\nThe Role of Renewables\n\nOn a national basis, the U.S., China, and Kazakhstan each had renewable shares of 22.5%, 30.2%, and 11.3% respectively. For context, renewables made up 30% of the world\u2019s electricity generation in 2022 (not including nuclear).\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s dismal renewable share is due to their heavy reliance on coal (60%), which is also a major export of the central Asian country. At the same time, coal contributes a similar amount of the electricity in China (61%), but their overall renewable share is higher because of their breakneck expansion of wind and solar power.\n\nWagons Ho?\n\nJust where a Bitcoin miner sets up their rig is important, because unlike many other industries with factories or big head offices, they are mobile (Google \u2018Bitcoin mining shipping containers\u2019 if you need convincing).\n\nWhere they choose to put out their shingle is based on things like the regulatory regime, price of electricity, and because Bitcoin rigs generate a lot of heat, the average outdoor temperature. On this last point, here is how the top 10 breaks down by mean annual temperature:\n\nIncreasingly, though, with climate change driving the push to renewables, many Bitcoin miners are looking more closely at where their electricity is coming from. This could be why Canada\u2014with its embarrassment of hydroelectric riches\u2014has crept up the ranking from less than one percent of the network in 2019, to six-and-a-half percent at the end of 2021.\n\nBut considering that top renewable countries such as Iceland, Paraguay, and Norway together only hosted just over one percent of the global network, there\u2019s still a lot more room left for growth."

        "content": "Investor appetite for ether futures exchange-traded funds has remained muted, despite a surge in new listings.\n\nSix new ether futures funds from Bitwise Asset Management, ProShares and VanEck launched on Oct. 2. As of Thursday's close, all six funds have posted losses of 5% or greater since their debuts.\n\nThe broader outlook for crypto is partly to blame, Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Bob Pisani on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" last Monday.\n\n\"When [the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) ] generated a billion dollars on its launch of bitcoin futures, that was because it was brand new,\" said Edelman. \"Frankly, bitcoin was doing fabulous at the time in 2021 and a lot of folks really didn't understand exactly what that fund was, being bitcoin futures. You fast-forward a couple of years, people have learned a lot.\"\n\nThe six ether futures funds that debuted Oct. 2 attracted just $1.92 million collectively on their first day of trading, according to LSEG. When the BITO ETF \u2014 a futures product based on bitcoin \u2014 launched in late 2021, it saw approximately $1 billion of inflows in its first two trading days alone.\n\nCryptocurrencies underlying the futures-based products are still well off their all-time highs reached in November 2021. Bitcoin is hovering near $27,000 \u2014 more than $40,000 below its peak \u2014 while ether is down more than 60% from its high, currently valued near $1,500.\n\nEdelman added that the nature of futures ETFs may be keeping some investors on the sidelines.\n\n\"People are recognizing, 'I don't ordinarily buy futures, so if I'm not buying futures in the stock market, why would I buy futures in the crypto market?'\"\n\nCurrently, regulators are weighing the approval of cryptocurrency spot ETFs that trade based on the current market price of the underlying asset, rather than futures contracts.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has previously blocked spot bitcoin ETFs from coming to market, but a federal appeals court in August overturned a ruling that would prevent Grayscale from converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The SEC has until Friday to appeal the decision.\n\nAccording to Edelman, consumer safety is at stake.\n\n\"The absence of a spot bitcoin ETF isn't stopping people from buying crypto. It's just forcing them to pay for exotic products that cost more and have less liquidity and higher risk,\" he said.\n\nDisclaimer"

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: A Detailed Comparative Study - Clarion Ledger",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nAs the digital age moves ahead, the Bitcoin vs. Ethereum debate continues to captivate financial markets globally. Bitcoin enjoys worldwide recognition and the highest market cap in the industry, whereas Ethereum stands as a versatile contender, enriching the crypto ecosystem with its multifaceted functionality and solidifying its place as the second most valuable cryptocurrency. Investors, faced with the formidable task of selecting between these two titans, are in dire need of an in-depth comparison to make well-informed decisions. This is where this detailed article can bridge the information gap, providing you with the clarity required in this dynamic crypto race.\n\nWhat follows is a comprehensive comparison of the two, exploring their underlying technology, investment potential, and future prospects, delivering a compelling argument for prospective investors and blockchain enthusiasts alike.\n\nInitially, it is vital to recognize the foundational technology that underpins these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the vanguard of digital currencies, operates on a simple, unalterable blockchain technology, ensuring a secure, decentralized ledger for transactions. Its primary purpose is to serve as a digital substitute for traditional fiat currencies. Ethereum, conversely, expands upon this foundational blockchain concept by integrating \u201csmart contracts\u201d\u2014autonomous scripts that execute transactions when predefined conditions are met. This enables Ethereum to function not just as a currency but as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), thus providing a broader functionality.\n\nTransitioning from technology to investment potential, the inherent characteristics of both Bitcoin and Ethereum significantly influence their respective financial value. Bitcoin's greatest investment appeal lies in its scarcity; with a predetermined limit of 21 million bitcoins, it is often likened to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d This artificial scarcity has fueled its value, rendering Bitcoin an intriguing hedge against inflation. Ethereum, however, holds a different investment proposition through its potential for growth. As the fuel for dApps, its utility extends beyond being a mere currency, which could potentially lead to increased demand and, subsequently, value.\n\nSimultaneously, it's crucial to cast an analytical eye on the future prospects of these cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, with its robust security and simplicity, is steadily gaining acceptance as a viable form of payment, hinting toward a promising future. Yet, its lack of a broader technological use poses a challenge to its long-term relevance. Ethereum, on the other hand, is projected to undergo significant technological upgrades, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0. This shift towards a more energy-efficient model, paired with its increasing utilization in the burgeoning field of decentralized finance (DeFi), suggests a future of endless possibilities.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently industry leaders, their future depends on a multitude of factors, including regulatory pressures, market sentiments, and technological advancements. However, it is crucial to remember that the world of cryptocurrency is replete with risk and unpredictability. Investors are strongly advised to conduct thorough research and consult with financial advisors before venturing into the turbulent seas of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum share the common foundation of blockchain technology, their purposes, investment potential, and future prospects diverge significantly. With its straightforward operation and scarcity-based value, Bitcoin offers a stable yet limiting experience. Ethereum's more complex and innovative approach provides a wider array of applications but requires a higher tolerance for potential volatility. Choosing between these two depends largely on an individual's investment goals and risk tolerance. If you're interested in staying informed about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency market, including the Ethereum price and Bitcoin price, it's suggested to follow reputable sources and stay up-to-date on market trends. As the crypto saga continues to unfold, these digital currencies\u2019 distinct characteristics will shape their respective journeys, influencing the future of the digital financial market.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "How Does Bitcoin & Crypto Fare During Geopolitical Events? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Geopolitical events are not uncommon in the global financial scene, and they frequently cause rippling effects in traditional markets. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have arisen as an alternative asset class in recent years, and their response to geopolitical turbulence has garnered substantial attention. We investigate how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have historically performed during geopolitical events and whether they exhibit features that distinguish them from traditional investments during times of uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin: The Digital Gold Story\n\nBitcoin, also known as \"digital gold,\" has gained popularity as a potential safe-haven asset during geopolitical crises. According to this narrative, Bitcoin is analogous to gold in that it may be used as a store of value and a hedge against economic volatility.\n\nHistorically, when international tensions rise or traditional markets face difficulty, Bitcoin's price fluctuates. Some investors and analysts feel this demonstrates its growing importance as a risk-off asset. During such occasions, investors looking for alternatives to traditional financial instruments may turn to Bitcoin to diversify their portfolios.\n\nGeopolitical Unrest's Impact on Bitcoin: A Closer Look\n\nThe ongoing Middle East conflict is sending ripples through the crypto market. The war's extension into its fourth day has raised concerns about Bitcoin and other riskier assets.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nGlobal market worries focus on the potential expansion of the conflict to nearby oil-producing countries, keeping investors on edge. This uncertainty has already affected the crypto market, causing a 2% dip on Monday due to surging oil prices and concerns about international trade.\n\nDespite this, there's a ray of hope for cryptocurrencies, which have shown early signs of resilience. Notably, they weathered the storm after previous geopolitical shocks, such as the aftermath of the U.S. imposing sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in March of the previous year.\n\nIt's essential to consider that Bitcoin and other digital assets can be significantly influenced by geopolitical conflicts. During such events, investors often turn to traditional safe havens like gold, while cryptocurrencies, seen as riskier, may face temporary setbacks.\n\nMonitoring oil and energy markets can provide insights into Bitcoin's future trajectory. Rising oil prices can trigger equity sell-offs and heighten expectations of tighter monetary policy, presenting risks to both Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.\n\nIn our interconnected world, global conflicts have far-reaching consequences, making it crucial for the crypto community to stay vigilant about the impact of geopolitical events on digital assets.\n\nCase Study: Bitcoin During the Trade War Between the United States and China\n\nThe trade war between the United States and China that raged between 2018 and 2020 is an important case study of Bitcoin's reaction to geopolitical events. As trade tensions rose, Bitcoin saw moments of increased price volatility. While it is too soon to declare Bitcoin a safe-haven asset, the correlation between escalating geopolitical tensions and Bitcoin price changes implies a possible link.\n\nDuring this time, Bitcoin gained increased interest from institutional investors and hedge funds wanting to diversify their portfolios amid market turmoil. This interest fostered the idea of Bitcoin as a geopolitical risk hedge.\n\nResilience of the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nAside from Bitcoin, the larger cryptocurrency market has shown resilience in the face of geopolitical events. While the market is recognized for its natural volatility, it has also demonstrated a strong tendency to recover rapidly after periods of instability.\n\nThe decentralized structure of cryptocurrencies is one probable explanation for their endurance. Cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional assets tied to specific governments or institutions, operate on decentralized networks, making them less vulnerable to the direct impact of geopolitical events.\n\n.\n\nFurthermore, cryptocurrency can provide individuals in economically troubled areas with a way to preserve their capital. In nations where there is currency depreciation, hyperinflation, or capital controls, cryptocurrencies can be a lifeline, allowing people to move and preserve their possessions.\n\nRegulatory Obstacles\n\nDespite the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies during geopolitical crises, they are nevertheless subject to regulatory scrutiny in a number of nations. Governments and regulatory agencies are concerned that cryptocurrencies are not utilized for illegal purposes such as money laundering or terrorism financing.\n\nAs investors react to news of prospective regulatory changes, this regulatory scrutiny may cause heightened volatility in bitcoin markets. Some say, however, that regulatory clarity and acceptance can ultimately help to legitimize and stabilize the bitcoin industry.\n\nThe Evolution of Cryptocurrency as a Financial Instrument\n\nCryptocurrencies are growing into increasingly sophisticated financial tools as geopolitical events continue to unfold. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tied to the value of fiat currencies, provide stability during market volatility. These digital assets have the potential to serve as a link between the existing financial system and the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, decentralized finance (DeFi) systems have grown in popularity, providing a wide range of financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without the use of intermediaries. DeFi applications are available to everyone with an internet connection, making them especially useful in areas where traditional financial services are unavailable.\n\nVolatility vs. Long-Term Prospects\n\nIt is critical to recognize that cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are notorious for their volatility. While they may provide potential as safe-haven investments during geopolitical crises, their price swings can be significant and may not correspond with all investors' risk tolerance.\n\nSome regard this volatility as a short-term trait, while others focus on cryptocurrencies' long-term potential. Bitcoin's fixed quantity of 21 million coins, as well as its decentralized character, continue to entice many who believe it can serve as a long-term hedge against fiat currency depreciation and economic instability.\n\nDiversification Plan\n\nDiversification is a fundamental principle for investors considering cryptocurrencies as part of their portfolio. While cryptocurrencies may exhibit distinct features amid geopolitical events, they should be viewed as one component of a larger investment plan.\n\nBefore devoting a portion of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives. Consultation with financial advisors or industry professionals can provide significant insights and help on incorporating cryptocurrencies into a diverse investment strategy.\n\nFinally, a Growing Asset Class\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are still relatively new in the financial world, and their reaction to geopolitical events is continuously evolving. While they exhibit qualities that are consistent with the concept of safe-haven investments, their intrinsic volatility necessitates caution.\n\nCryptocurrencies may play an increasingly important role in providing investors with options during times of geopolitical turbulence as the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, regulatory clarity increases, and institutional usage grows. For the time being, they are a dynamic and evolving asset class that requires careful analysis within the context of investing strategy."

He spoke to someone claiming to be an employee of Microsoft online services and was allegedly told that fraudulent activity had been detected in his Bank of America account.\n\nThe Chandler man was allegedly told to move his assets to a more \"secure\" location like a bitcoin ATM located inside a liquor store on Arizona Avenue, records show.\n\nScammers using cryptocurrency ATMs and QR codes to dupe money out of people has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, according to the FBI. It can be more difficult for law enforcement to recover funds exchanged through this type of transaction so the FBI advises citizens to be cautious of entities demanding cryptocurrency as payment.\n\nThe man in Chandler allegedly deposited about $60,000 into the bitcoin ATMs before he objected to the process and then was instructed to make alternative forms of payment.\n\nRecords show the man placed $40,000 in a cardboard box and was told to give the box to a woman who later visited his neighborhood.\n\nThe following day, the man was contacted again and encouraged to buy up to $78,000 in gold from a local jewelry shop. After buying the gold coins, the Chandler man would get instructions on how to hand off the gold.\n\nAfter Chandler police were contacted, they decided to create a \"bait package\" containing a GPS device that would be delivered to the unknown person picking up the gold.\n\nOn Oct. 9, the Chandler man was told to meet someone at a location and hand off the parcel. Undercover detectives then trailed the car that picked up the package and followed it to a local hotel, records show.\n\nPolice eventually conducted a traffic stop and detained two men. Court records identify the individuals as 24-year-old Jeet Panchal and 28-year-old Farhan Shaikh.\n\nIn an interview with police, Shaikh allegedly told investigators that Panchal had agreed to pay him $200 for a ride to Arizona. He denied having knowledge about the package picked up by the other suspect.\n\nBoth men were booked into jail and are facing charges of theft and fraud.\n\nA list of common scams involving bitcoin ATMs can be found here."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) failed to hit $100,000 during the 2021 bull market because defunct exchange FTX kept selling BTC, analysis claims.\n\nIn an X (formerly Twitter) post on Oct. 12, Joe Burnett, senior product marketing manager at Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, joined voices arguing that FTX executives suppressed BTC price strength.\n\nFTX testimony reveals mass BTC selling\n\nAs the trial of former FTX CEO Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried continues, new testimony paints a picture of potential market manipulation.\n\nThis week, Caroline Ellison, former CEO of affiliated firm Alameda Research, reportedly told the court that Bankman-Fried asked her to sell BTC should its spot price breach $20,000. This was done using FTX customer funds, which neither had the right to deploy.\n\nAUSA: What are these?\n\nEllison: Notes from a conversation with Sam.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) faced a 4.9% correction in the four days following its failure to break the $28,000 resistance on Oct. 8, and derivatives metrics show fear is dominating sentiment in the market \u2014 but will it be enough to shake Bitcoin price from its current range?\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, Bitcoin is holding up admirably, especially when compared with gold, which has fallen by 5% since June, and Treasury Inflation-Protected (TIP) bonds, which have seen a 4.2% drop during the same period. Merely maintaining its position at $27,700, Bitcoin has outperformed two of the most secure assets in traditional finance.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s price rejection at $28,000 on Oct. 8, investors should analyze BTC derivatives metrics to determine whether bears are indeed in control.\n\nBitcoin/USD vs. inflation-protected TIP ETF vs. gold. Source: TradingView\n\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities are U.S. government bonds designed to safeguard against inflation. Consequently, the value of TIP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tends to rise with increasing inflation since the bond principal and interest payments adjust to inflation, preserving the purchasing power for investors.\n\n$27,600 Bitcoin is not necessarily a bad thing\n\nRegardless of how you frame this historic achievement, Bitcoin enthusiasts may not be entirely satisfied with its current $520 billion market capitalization, even though it surpasses the market caps of global payment processor Visa ($493 billion) and Exxon Mobil ($428 billion). This bullish expectation is partly based on Bitcoin\u2019s previous all-time high market cap of $1.3 trillion in November 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies \u2014 including the euro, Swiss franc and British pound \u2014 is nearing its highest level in 10 months. This indicates a strong vote of confidence in the resilience of the U.S. economy, at least in relative terms. This alone should be enough to justify reduced interest in alternative hedge instruments like Bitcoin.\n\nSome may argue that the 3% gains in the S&P 500 index since June contradict the idea of investors seeking cash positions. However, the top 25 companies hold a combined $4.2 trillion in cash and equivalents, in addition to being highly profitable. This explains why stocks are also being used as a hedge rather than a risk-seeking venture.\n\nIn essence, there is no reason for Bitcoin investors to be dissatisfied with its recent performance. However, this sentiment changes when we analyze BTC derivatives metrics.\n\nBitcoin derivatives show declining demand from bulls\n\nTo begin with, Bitcoin\u2019s futures contract premium, also known as the basis rate, reached its lowest level in four months. Normally, Bitcoin monthly futures trade at a slight premium compared to spot markets, indicating that sellers demand additional money to postpone settlement. As a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at an annualized premium of 5% to 10%, a situation not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe current 3.2% futures premium (basis rate) is at its lowest point since mid-June, before BlackRock filed for a spot ETF. This metric indicates a reduced appetite for leverage buyers, although it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect bearish expectations.\n\nTo determine whether the rejection at $28,000 on Oct. 8 has led to decreased optimism among investors, traders should examine Bitcoin options markets. The 25% delta skew is a telling indicator, especially when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nRelated: Did SBF really use FTX traders\u2019 Bitcoin to keep BTC price under $20K?\n\nIf traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and periods of excitement tend to have a -7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs shown above, the Bitcoin options\u2019 25% delta skew switched to \u201cfear\u201d mode on Oct. 10, with protective put (sell) options currently trading at a 13% premium compared to similar call (buy) options.\n\nBitcoin derivatives metrics suggest that traders are becoming less confident, which can be partly attributed to the multiple postponements of the spot Bitcoin ETF decisions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and concerns regarding exchanges\u2019 exposure to terrorist organizations.\n\nFor now, the negative sentiment toward cryptocurrencies seems to invalidate any benefits arising from macroeconomic uncertainty and the natural hedge protection provided by Bitcoin\u2019s predictable monetary policy. At least from a derivatives perspective, the likelihood of Bitcoin\u2019s price breaking above $28,000 in the short term appears slim.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Mainstream Bitcoin (BTC) adoption won\u2019t happen until it bridges to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) \u2014 the first point of entry for many real-world assets moving on-chain, a Web3 executive argues.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, the founder of cross-chain infrastructure firm Botanix Labs, Willem Schro\u00e9, claimed Bitcoin \u201cneeds to start playing in the EVM world\u201d for it to build real-world use cases to increase its adoption and utility.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the most technologically secure and truly decentralized protocol [and] the EVM has proven itself to be the application layer for the global financial system,\u201d Schro\u00e9 said.\n\nOur Botanix Protocol positions Ethereum as a Layer-2 solution on top of #Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWe've added Ethereum onto the Bitcoin Network's secure foundation to harness the security of its Proof-of-Work mechanism.\n\n\n\nAlso, enjoy the developmental ease of Ethereum. \u2014 Botanix Labs (@BotanixLabs) September 25, 2023\n\nWhile Bitcoin is typically used as a peer-to-peer payment system or for storing value, Schro\u00e9 said its potential won\u2019t be fulfilled unless the cryptocurrency can connect to the broader financial system, such as with security and commodity markets.\n\nConnecting Bitcoin to Ethereum-based real-world assets, stablecoins, decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens via the EVM is the first step in that direction, Schro\u00e9 argued.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge amount of value and development waiting to happen.\u201d\n\nSchro\u00e9\u2019s Botanix Labs aims to connect the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems through its \u201cSpiderchain\u201d \u2014 a proof-of-stake layer 2 that implements EVM to EVM bridges to enable Bitcoin to interact with the EVM.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum may seem like opposites, but they can co-exist and complement each other.\n\n\n\nHowever, this does present some challenges.\n\n\n\nMulti-chain ecosystems with cross-chain bridges can have security and centralization risks, hindering the potential of collaboration. \u2014 Botanix Labs (@BotanixLabs) October 2, 2023\n\nStaked assets are secured by a decentralized multisignature mechanism, and its design doesn\u2019t require Bitcoin to be forked.\n\nSchro\u00e9 believes the current solutions involving wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains are problematic and argues they are susceptible to censorship and regulatory scrutiny, as they\u2019re operated by the centralized United States-based company BitGo.\n\nA similar proposal to bring Ethereum functionality to Bitcoin is also being proposed through \u201cdrivechains,\u201d also known as the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-300, which Bitcoin developers are again discussing. If implemented, it would allow \u201csidechains\u201d to be built on the network.\n\nOn Oct. 9, Bitcoin developer Robin Linus released a white paper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin,\u201d which details how Ethereum-like optimistic rollup smart contracts could be made on the Bitcoin network.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoiners teach 12-year-olds how to send sats\n\nUnlike the Spiderchain, BIP-300 would require Bitcoin to soft fork and would be activated by miners \u2014 similar to the Taproot soft fork in November 2021 that paved the way for the NFT-emulating Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nThe BIP\u2019s creator, Paul Sztorc, says those favoring BIP-300 believe it will offer new privacy and scaling use cases to Bitcoin, among other benefits.\n\nSo far at @tabconf:\n\n\n\n* Many pro Bip300 -- popular usecases are Privacy, Scaling, and experimentation (get new OP codes now)\n\n* Very popular question is: when is my debate with Peter Todd (Friday at 2 PM)\n\n* Many complained about off-base Twitter dialog and nonsense propaganda\n\n*\u2026 \u2014 Paul Sztorc (@Truthcoin) September 7, 2023\n\nHowever, not everyone likes the idea of expanding Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem beyond its current use cases.\n\nCory Klippsten, the CEO of BTC-only exchange Swan Bitcoin, believes drivechains and solutions that bring other assets to Bitcoin will bring an influx of scammers.\n\nSaifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, opposes the idea of issuing altcoins on Bitcoin, suggesting that \u201cgood money\u201d is the only token needed.\n\nPeople only think tokens are a good idea because we live in a world of broken money.

        "content": "Leer esta p\u00e1gina en: Espa\u00f1ol\n\nhttps://deceleration.news/wp-content/uploads/speaker/post-40153.mp3?cb=1697041822.mp3 Listen to this story\n\nDeceleration illustration. Based on work by Valery Santillana via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nTargeting high water use, energy waste, and round-the-clock noise, skeptics are challenging Bitcoin efforts in Navarro County and the state of Texas, the author of \u2018Let Them Eat Crypto\u2019 writes.\n\nPeter Howson\n\nTexas loves crypto. At least, that\u2019s what you\u2019d think listening to the deafening drone of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining hubs springing up across the state. They run at around 85 decibels. The noise is equivalent to having a hair dryer blowing full power next to your face 24/7.\n\nCrypto mining globally is responsible for using a big, developed country\u2019s worth of electricity every year. The industry spits out thousands of tons of burned-out e-waste and toxic \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d These are the cancer-causing fluids that never break down, but are used and dumped without remorse to cool noisy Bitcoin machines.\n\nOver the last two years Texas has overtaken China as the global Bitcoin superpower. Using mainly gas and coal, no other jurisdiction on Earth creates more crypto than the Lone Star state.\n\nTexas has always had a haphazard approach to keeping the lights (and Bitcoin machines) on. Unlike most other US states\u2014which benefit from integration with the Eastern or Western Interconnections power grids\u2014Texas operates its own grid and is uniquely vulnerable to poor energy planning. When the lights go out here, people die. After hundreds died from hypothermia during a winter storm in 2021, US regulators recommended urgent upgrades to ensure the Texas network\u2019s reliability in extreme weather conditions. The recommendations were ignored.\n\nWith an increasing body count, in 2022 the state grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), devised a new energy management strategy. To prepare for more frequent and severe weather events caused by climate change, Texas would turn to Bitcoin.\n\nThe reason given for the seemingly bizarre energy policy was \u201cload balancing.\u201d Bitcoin miners escaping from corrupt regimes overseas (otherwise known as countries with environmental laws) promised to \u201cstabilize\u201d the Texas grid. These incoming Bitcoiners negotiated 10-year fixed-supply agreements, paying around 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity pulled from the grid. The going residential rate is 18.5 cents.\n\nA \u201cdemand\u2013response program\u201d would enable power suppliers to ask Bitcoiners to shut down their operations when demand across the grid was high. If they did so voluntarily, ERCOT would pay the company credits towards future power. Miners from all over the world flocked to Texas enticed by the low energy prices and lax environmental regulation. As of mid-2023, the state was home to around 10 percent of all the world\u2019s Bitcoin miners, who together were adding 20,000 megawatts of demand to the Texas grid. That\u2019s roughly equal to the amount of electricity used by the whole of Houston.\n\nHeatwaves have brought \u201dexceptional drought\u201d conditions to much of Texas\u2014the highest categorization of dryness\u2014denoting \u201cwidespread crop loss, dead rangeland, producers not planting fields, forestry, tourism, and agriculture sectors reporting significant financial loss, and extreme sensitivity to fire danger.\u201d Last year, hundreds of Texans suffered heat-related deaths. Many endured rolling blackouts.\n\nMeanwhile in Rockdale, Texas, Riot Platforms\u2014owners of the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin-mining center\u2014were sucking up millions of gallons of cool fresh water.\n\nAlexa Neuendorf, Kimberlee Walter, Jackie Sawicky, and Monica Vickery protest the arrival of bitcoin mining in Navarro County, Texas. Image: John Blewitt\n\nThe huge amount of electricity Riot needs is enough to power every home in the county ten times over. One Texas-based activist, Jackie Sawicky, told me that the additional water demand would be enough to fill two Olympic-sized swimming pools every day. \u201cThese people are parasites,\u201d Sawicky said.\n\n\u201cRiot spoke to us at a town hall meeting. They were honest. They said, \u2018You people have two very important things for Riot: water and the Navarro County electrical switching station.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Bitcoiners were there to fix the grid without the need for government interference. \u201cA lot of people view Bitcoin as a consumer of energy,\u201d said Cruz at an event in October 2021. \u201cThe perspective I\u2019m suggesting is very much the reverse, which is [using Bitcoin] as a way to strengthen our energy infrastructure.\u201d\n\nFor Sawicky, the Bitcoiners\u2019 intentions were clear: \u201cThey\u2019re coming here to exploit the shit out of us,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to energy management services firm Voltus, miners relocating to Texas could generate up to 10 percent of their total revenue from demand-response credits. Credits would be paid to miners from the bills of residential customers who would in turn see their rates rise by an estimated five percent. Today, ordinary Texans are reportedly subsidizing the profits of Bitcoin miners to the tune of $1.8 billion every year. Some of the Bitcoin miners benefiting from Cruz\u2019s crypto policy weren\u2019t even in Texas.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s finally found a real-world use-case for crypto-currency: NOT mining it,\u201d Tweeted MSNBC news host Chris Hayes in response to news that ERCOT was paying Bitcoiners in Colorado $13 million to switch off their machines.\n\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind that across the U.S., you are more likely to be killed by a hamster than you are to come across a business accepting payment in crypto.\n\nIn my new book, Let Them Eat Crypto: The Blockchain Scam That\u2019s Ruining the World, I explain how this technology\u2014one that virtually no one uses\u2014comes with huge costs for communities and the environment.\n\nCryptocurrencies are gambling tokens. Other than naive speculation, they are used almost solely for ransomware, extortion, and sanctions evasion. It is no surprise that many in Texas have had enough of it.\n\nThe growing groundswell of opposition to Bitcoin here is thanks in part to action by local pressure group, Concerned Citizens of Navarro County. This October, the group is launching a Week of Action to raise awareness of the huge costs ordinary Texans are paying for crypto. The outreach events are supported by the environmental advocacy organization Greenpeace.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been arranging town hall meetings and block walking every weekend\u201d, Sawicky tells me. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense of hope and momentum. This is people power.\u201d\n\nTexas is the epicenter for what is perhaps the most purposefully polluting industry in the world today. While the negative impacts of asbestos toothpaste and leaded gasoline were once a byproduct of something useful, the same cannot be said for the wasted resources from the crypto industry. Luckily there\u2019s a growing grassroots movement standing up to it.\n\n-30-\n\nPeter Howson is a technology writer, researcher, and assistant professor in international development.

        "title": "Navigating the Bitcoin Minefield: Key Factors to Watch - Asbury Park Press",
        "content": "William Mullane\n\nContributor\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have taken the financial world\u2019s interest, offering a possible alternative to traditional fiat currencies. However, the volatility of Bitcoin, coupled with its nascent status, presents a veritable minefield for potential investors. This article seeks to illuminate some key factors affecting Bitcoin's value and offers insights on what investors should vigilantly monitor.\n\n1. Market Demand and Adoption: Cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, hinge on market acceptance. As more businesses, consumers, and investors embrace Bitcoin, its value appreciates. The integration of Bitcoin into major financial institutions, from PayPal to Fidelity, indicates a growing adoption curve. However, investors need to be wary. While acceptance is growing, it is not universal. Regulatory scrutiny, a lack of understanding, and technological barriers can limit broader market adoption, affecting Bitcoin's price.\n\n2. Regulatory News and Policies: Regulatory decisions significantly sway Bitcoin's value. Governmental regulations worldwide fluctuate widely, from outright bans to wholehearted endorsements. Any news of stringent regulations or bans can result in a substantial sell-off, leading to a decline in Bitcoin's price. Conversely, supportive regulatory climates can encourage investment and usage, driving prices upwards. Investors need to stay abreast of the latest regulatory developments across the globe and understand the implications on their Bitcoin holdings.\n\n3. Technological Developments: Bitcoin's open-source nature means constant evolution and improvement. Technological advancements, such as the Lightning Network, enhance scalability and usability, making Bitcoin more appealing to a broader audience. However, potential technological vulnerabilities or security breaches can impact investor confidence, leading to price fluctuations. Consequently, a grasp of the current technological landscape and future developments is crucial.\n\n4. Macroeconomic Factors: Bitcoin's price is susceptible to macroeconomic movements. Inflation, geopolitical unrest, financial crises, and shifts in investor sentiment can all lead to Bitcoin price volatility. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic instability recently led many investors to consider Bitcoin a potential \"digital gold,\" driving up the value. Investors need to be cognizant of the broader macroeconomic environment and understand how these elements may influence Bitcoin's value.\n\n5. Bitcoin Halving: This unique factor related to Bitcoin's supply happens approximately every four years, halving the rewards that miners receive for validating transactions and creating new Bitcoins. Historically, these halving events have led to substantial price increases due to the supply-demand dynamics. Investors should be aware of when the next halving will occur and understand its potential impact on Bitcoin's price.\n\nNavigating the Bitcoin market can be likened to traversing a labyrinth filled with untold riches and potential pitfalls. Each turn represents a factor that could significantly alter the landscape. The key to successful navigation lies in understanding these factors \u2013 market demand and adoption, regulatory news and policies, technological developments, macroeconomic factors, and the Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe cryptocurrency world remains a volatile and uncertain one. By gaining a solid grasp of these factors, investors can equip themselves with the tools necessary to make informed decisions, thereby mitigating potential risks and maximizing rewards. It is crucial to approach this dynamic arena with a calculated strategy informed by an understanding of these parameters.\n\nAs an investment vehicle, Bitcoin offers significant opportunities and challenges. It is a complex asset class that requires vigilance, understanding, and a keen eye for detail. By understanding the factors affecting its value, investors can avoid the proverbial mines and chart a course through the exciting world of Bitcoin investment.\n\nThis is for informational purposes only. Please invest at your own risk."

        "content": "In their arsenal of modern warfare, Hamas uses rockets, drones, and even paragliders. In the digital sphere, they leveraged mobile phones and internet connections to broadcast their actions globally. But, the burning question is, where did the money for all this come from?\n\nCryptocurrency. Yes, you heard it right. The darling of the decentralized financial world, crypto, has a dark side, too. It's not just a tool for rebellious libertarians or tech-savvy traders; it's also the secret weapon of militant groups.\n\nHuge Seizures\n\nIn August 2020, the US government managed to seize millions of dollars from a number of groups that had been using crypto to fund their activities. But, here's the shocker: Palestinian Islamic Jihad, one of the groups responsible for seizing Israeli hostages, still managed to collect a staggering $93 million worth of cryptocurrency between June 2021 and August 2023, according to the WSJ. Hamas, the heavyweight of Palestinian groups, also raked in around $41 million in digital payments Payments One of the bases of mediums of exchange in the modern world, a payment constitutes the transfer of a legal currency or equivalent from one party in exchange for goods or services to another entity.

And, here's a staggering figure to chew on \u2014 the UN estimates that crypto accounts for a whopping 20% of global terror funding.\n\nCalls for Donations since at Least 2019\n\nHamas affiliates, including its notorious military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, have been openly asking for Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term donations since at least 2019. But, here's the kicker: these groups are not choosy. They've dabbled in various currencies, from dogecoin, which Elon Musk casually tweets about, to stablecoins like Tether and USDC, tied to the mighty US dollar. Amazingly, these calls were still happening even as the militants attacked. Israel Police's Lahav 433 cyber unit was working with Binance to lock down accounts linked to Hamas and to transfer the funds to the state. Since 2021, the authorities have confiscated 189 crypto accounts tied to Palestinian militant groups on Binance.\n\nIsrael Police Freeze #Crypto Accounts Held at #Binance Allegedly Used by Hamas https://t.co/fxxURZk5ul \u2014 Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) October 11, 2023\n\nIn a report from August 2023, Elliptic, a watchdog for crypto compliance, even mentioned that wallets it was keeping tabs on indicated that these terror groups were investing in DeFi protocols and making money using Solana, the crypto superstar backed by FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nHow Does This Happen?\n\nNow, you might wonder how these organizations manage to get their hands on crypto when they can't exactly stroll into the New York Stock Exchange. The answer? Smart contracts that conveniently sidestep those pesky \"know-your-customer\" (KYC) checks. According to Elliptic, some of these groups are even into crypto mining, which is essentially profiting from the nuts and bolts of cryptocurrency networks.\n\nTo counter this, Israeli and US officials have been trying to rope in crypto exchanges like Binance to block access for users tied to these groups. They're focusing their efforts on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body setting the rules to prevent money laundering. The FATF still lists dozens of countries on its \"grey list\", meaning they haven't met these standards. And, it includes names like Jordan, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates."

        "content": "Things seem to have taken a turn lower in the crypto market, but bitcoin offers a glimmer of hope and Wolfe Research is defending its long view of the asset. The crypto market continues to struggle from low volume and liquidity that have dragged on for most of the year. It has traded in a narrow range between $25,000 and $30,000 all year, which many had seen as encouraging, demonstrating that although investors weren't building positions, they weren't exiting either. \"That changed this week with Monday seeing over $105 million in crypto liquidations, and the equal weight crypto index we track breaking down in turn,\" Wolfe Research's Rob Ginsberg said in a note Wednesday. \"We have repeatedly touched on how uninspiring the price action has been outside of bitcoin, and it appears the cracks are finally starting to show.\" \"While the resiliency of Bitcoin continues to be the one silver lining, it's growing increasingly clear just how alone it stands,\" he added. \"[It's] rolling over again in the near term, but our thesis on bitcoin is simple: [as] long as $25,000 support is holding, we'll remain long.\" It takes a patient investor, however. Although bitcoin is up about 61% this year, it's off its all-time high by as much. Not only has it been unable to break out to new highs above $30,000 this year after hitting it for the first time this year as early as April, but it has also underperformed equities for the better part of two years. On top of that, Treasury yields remain high amid stubbornly high inflation and uncertainty around the Israel-Hamas war. \"Higher yields have historically proven to be a headwind to crypto and growth alike,\" Ginsberg said. \"Having failed to take advantage of this pullback thus far, if yields reaccelerate like we think, it should throw some added pressure on BTC.\" Crypto stocks are also trading down, but may be finding support now, according to Wolfe. \"If these bases are for real \u2026 which we believe they are, a next leg higher will have to come soon,\" Ginsberg said. He also highlighted the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF , which is back to its February highs and up about 90% this year. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

It's nowhere near solving scalability.\n\nWe need more complementary things.\n\n\n\n> this is just another defi on bitcoin attempt.\n\n\n\nAgain, the motivation behind BitVM by the author was not DeFi. It was scaling. \u2014 Hampus (@hampus_s) October 12, 2023\n\nHowever, Super Testnet tells Cointelegraph that BitVM is scaling-focused rather than being about implementing smart contracts and an avalanche of altcoins:\n\n\u201cThe real killer app is scaling Bitcoin. [Robin Linus isn\u2019t] a big fan of smart contracts. He\u2019s not a big fan of increasing Bitcoin\u2019s expressivity. He really is interested in making it so that Bitcoin can process millions of transactions per second.\u201d\n\nSuper Testnet said he doesn\u2019t want BitVM to be flooded with EVM-like tokens because it\u2019ll bring bad actors to Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see everything from the Ethereum ecosystem because most of it is Ponzi schemes.\u201d\n\nBuilding a decentralized exchange on Bitcoin would be a \u201cstep backward,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Super Testnet notes that BitVM won\u2019t be an \u201cinstant death\u201d for Ethereum\u2019s altcoins, as some have suggested, though it could take demand away from them.\n\nHot Off the Press: BitVM White Paper Drops!

But one thing that Lightning doesn\u2019t do well is payment reliability.\u201d\n\nRiver, a Bitcoin-only exchange, revealed its Lightning payments success rate was 99.7% in August across 308,000 transactions.\n\nHe hopes BitVM can reach 60% of the transaction speed of the Lightning Network.\n\nBitVM: The 24 hour update.\n\n\n\nAfter thousands of Twitter posts and hours of spaces and discussions, we know much more about BitVM than we did yesterday.

If you want your money safe, keep it safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompute anything\u201d misconception\n\nSuper Testnet also clarified a possible misunderstanding, explaining that BitVM, in its current state, cannot compute \u201canything\u201d like its white paper suggests.\n\n\u201cWe have to build more primitives in order to make it so that anything can run in it.\u201d Implementing SHA-256 and encryption are some of the additions that need to be made, they noted.\n\nHowever, Super Testnet revealed on Oct. 12 that BitVM is already processing basic functions:\n\nUpdate: bitvm can perform *3* functions now and I'm in the middle of making a webpage where you can play with it pic.twitter.com/bXYOZKx2GV \u2014 Super Testnet (@super_testnet) October 12, 2023\n\nLinus and Super Testnet met at a Bitcoin conference around 18 months ago and have been working to scale Bitcoin at the scripting level ever since, he said.\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market staged a solid rebound this year after a disappointing 2022 as the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary tightening campaign, which saw aggressive interest rate hikes to combat multi-decade high inflation, weighed on cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB), have been rangebound over the past three months as investors are yet to get a clear picture about the Fed\u2019s future course of action with its interest rate hikes.\n\nBitcoin particularly had been on a rally till July, with its price hitting $31,500. However, the Fed has since hiked interest rates once in July, following which cryptocurrencies took a hit once again. In fact, Bitcoin has been falling since hitting its 52-week high in early July.\n\nHowever, it has also solidified its position over the past few weeks and is now hovering around $26,900 after falling as much as $25,400 in late August and September.\n\nThe rebound has been taking place since the Fed kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged in its September FOMC meeting to its current range of 5.25-5.25%.\n\nA higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies. The Fed\u2019s aggressive monetary tightening policy has also raised worries that the economy might slip into a recession.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, in his first post-FOMC comment, said that inflation remains elevated, which might require the central bank to hike interest rates by another 25 basis points before it starts cutting interest rates in 2024.\n\nFollowing Powell\u2019s hawkish comments, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note surged to its highest level since 2007. The 10-year Treasury yield holds immense significance as it mirrors market participants' outlook on the nation's economic situation, influencing consumers, businesses and government entities.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies are once again trying to rebound from their recent lows as investors\u2019 sentiments have been upbeat following dovish comments from a number of Fed officials. These officials believe that the recent tightening of credit conditions may make the central bank decide not to go for another interest rate hike in its November FOMC meeting.\n\nOur Choices\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.

        "content": "In a recent interview with CNBC, billionaire hedge fund manager and legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones expounded on his bullish stance on Bitcoin amidst mounting global tensions and economic uncertainties.\n\nJones, an influential figure in the investment world, highlighted the current geopolitical environment as one of the most \u201cthreatening and challenging\u201d he has ever witnessed and emphasized the importance of diversifying investment portfolios with assets like Bitcoin and gold.\n\nJones told CNBC, \u201cI love gold and bitcoin together. I think they probably take on a larger percentage of your portfolio than they would [historically] because we\u2019re going to go through both a challenging political time here in the United States and we\u2019ve obviously got a geopolitical situation.\u201d\n\nNow Is The Time To Buy Bitcoin And Gold\n\nRecent global events have exacerbated these sentiments. Over the weekend, the Israeli government launched a military response against Hamas following an attack on Israel, escalating tensions in an already fragile Middle Eastern region. Additionally, Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine and growing discord between China and the US have further rattled global markets and economies.\n\nIn the same breath, Jones remarked on the US\u2019s alarming fiscal position, stating it\u2019s \u201cprobably in its weakest fiscal position since World War II.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns about the potential impact of high interest rates on Bitcoin, Jones delved deeper into the dynamics of gold and market trades preceding a recession. He stipulated, \u201cI think on a relative basis what\u2019s happened to gold, it has been clearly suppressed. But you know that more likely or not we are going into a recession.\u201d\n\nJones underscored a few hallmarks of recessionary trading environments, indicating, \u201cThere are some pretty clear recession trades. The easiest are: the yield curve gets very steep, home premium goes into the backend of the debt market and the 10-year, 30-year, 7-year paper, the stock market typically right before recession declines about 12%.\u201d This decline, according to Jones, is not just plausible but likely to transpire at a certain juncture.\n\nAdditionally, he emphasized the prospective bullish market for assets like Bitcoin and gold during economic downturns, stating, \u201cAnd when you look at the big shorts in gold, more likely or not in a recession, the market is typically very long; assets like Bitcoin and gold.\u201d\n\nJones further prognosticated a substantial influx into the gold market, speculating, \u201cSo there\u2019s probably $40 billion worth of buying coming in gold at some point before now and when that recession actually occurs.\u201d Expressing his asset preference amidst the aforementioned conditions, Jones concisely noted, \u201cSo, I like Bitcoin and I like gold right now.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s endorsement of Bitcoin isn\u2019t new as the investor had previously championed the digital currency in several interviews, citing its potential as a hedge against inflation and lauding its immutable mathematical properties.\n\nHe once remarked, \u201cBitcoin is math, and math has been around for thousands of years.\u201d By mid-2021, Jones even increased his Bitcoin allocation from 1-2%, labeling it as a \u201cbet on certainty amid uncertain economic conditions.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s remarks came at a time when the cryptocurrency saw an approximate 63% increase year to date, making it the best-performing asset in 2023.\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,116, down roughly 2% over the past 24 hours. Amidst the recent price drop, BTC initially found support at the 200-day EMA (blue line), which the bulls should hold at all costs to avoid further downward momentum.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "A new report from Glassnode, an on-chain analytical firm, has buttressed recent data indicating Bitcoin holders are adding to their holdings. These long-term Bitcoin investors, often known as \u201cHODLers,\u201d don\u2019t appear to be phased by the recent volatility in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, long-term holders have been rapidly amassing Bitcoin, adding more than 50,000 BTC each month to their holdings.\n\nMonthly Accumulation Of BTC Worth $1.35 Billion\n\nBitcoin is currently showing signs of slowing down, as its price just dipped below $27,000. It would appear that short-term speculators are mostly to blame for the persistent selling pressure, as data shows whale investors are seeing this opportunity to buy more BTC at a discount rather than secure profits.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s HODLer Net Position Change metric, long-term holders are purchasing an average of 50,000 BTC worth $1.35 billion at the current price of Bitcoin every month.\n\nAnother metric, the Long-Term Holder Supply, which measures the amount of BTC\u2019s market cap with holders, also reached an all-time high of 14.859 million BTC. This means 76.1% of the total circulating supply has not moved in the past five months. Consequently, 94.8% of the total Bitcoin supply has not moved in the past month.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nTo back up this data of increased accumulation, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared chart data from Santiment showing Bitcoin whales have purchased around 20,000 BTC since the beginning of October, worth roughly $550 million.\n\nAt this rate, the number of BTC vaulted by holders is poised to pass 50,000 in October. This increased accumulation suggests that long-term holders remain confident in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential and see this price correction as temporary.\n\n#Bitcoin whales have purchased around 20,000 $BTC since the beginning of October, worth roughly $550 million! pic.twitter.com/47ZePiaIII \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2023\n\nBTC price falls below $27,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nBitcoin Supply Tightens\n\nAccording to Glassnode, only 11.5% of BTC\u2019s circulating supply changed hands in the last 3 months, indicating a prolonged inactive period of on-chain activity.

        "title": "Halving 2024: how it will affect Bitcoin - Bit2Me",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies has always been full of unique terms and events, and one of the most important is the Bitcoin halving. This event occurs approximately every four years and has a significant impact on the world's most famous cryptocurrency. In this article, we will explore in detail what is bitcoin halving, how bitcoin halving works and what implications it could have for investors and the crypto industry in general.\n\n\u00bfWhat is Bitcoin halving?? The Bitcoin halving is a scheduled event within the cryptocurrency protocol that halves the reward miners receive for validating blocks on the blockchain. In simpler terms, you could say that it is a halving in the amount of Bitcoin that is created and put into circulation with each new block created. The main goal of the halving is to control Bitcoin inflation and ensure that the supply of the cryptocurrency is limited. The Bitcoin halving process is based on a predefined and automatic algorithm. Every 210.000 blocks mined, approximately every four years, the reward miners receive is halved. Initially, when Bitcoin was launched in 2009, the reward was 50 BTC per block. With this mechanism in place, the first halving in 2012 reduced the reward to 25 BTC per block, and then to 12,5 BTC in the second halving in 2016. With the third halving in 2020, the reward was reduced to 6,25 BTC and finally with the fourth halving which will take place in 2024, the Bitcoin reward will drop to 3,125 BTC. This cycle will continue to be fulfilled as long as Bitcoin and its network continue to function, until the last cycle is fulfilled, in the year 2144. All of this following the economic plan of the network: issue a maximum of close to 21 million coins and drive the revaluation of BTC as its adoption and economic plan progress.\n\nImpact of Bitcoin halving and the industry Now, the impact of this new Bitcoin halving on the crypto industry and on cryptocurrency is enormous. Thus, we can measure this impact in the following fundamental spaces:\n\nMining, scarcity and demand Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are created and transactions are validated on the network. Miners use their computing equipment to solve complex mathematical problems that verify and secure Bitcoin transactions. In exchange for their work, miners are rewarded with newly generated bitcoins. The Bitcoin halving has a direct impact on cryptocurrency mining. And every 210.000 blocks mined (approx. 4 years), the reward miners receive per block is reduced by half. At the time of writing, the current block reward is 6,25 bitcoins, but after the 2024 halving, this will drop to 3,125 bitcoins. This reduction in reward has several implications. First of all, reduces the number of bitcoins entering circulation, contributing to the cryptocurrency's scarcity. This can have a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin in the long term, as the limited supply can increase its value. In second place, Halving affects the profitability of mining. When the reward is halved, miners receive fewer bitcoins for their work. This may make mining less profitable for some miners, especially those with higher electricity and equipment costs. Some miners may be forced to shut down their operations if they cannot cover their expenses. However, Halving can also have a positive effect on long-term mining profitability. If the price of Bitcoin rises enough, the reduction in the block reward can be offset by the additional value of the mined bitcoins. Additionally, halving can increase demand for mining equipment, which can benefit manufacturers and related service providers. In summary, the Bitcoin halving has a significant impact in cryptocurrency mining. It reduces the block reward, which can affect the profitability of miners and the supply of bitcoins in circulation. However, it can also contribute to scarcity and increase the value of Bitcoin in the long term. Besides, Bitcoin halving has its own phases and it is important for miners to understand these changes and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n\nVolatility La bitcoin volatility It is closely related to the halving due to several factors. First, the reduction in the amount of Bitcoin created and circulated may create scarcity in the market. As a result, demand for Bitcoin may increase, which may lead to an increase in the price of Bitcoin. However, this growth in demand can also lead to greater volatility, as investors and traders react to changes in price. Furthermore, halving also has an impact on the profitability of the company. bitcoin mining. With the reward for miners decreasing, some may choose to exit the market if profitability decreases. This can affect the hash rate of the Bitcoin network and, in turn, the stability and volatility of Bitcoin. It is important to note that volatility is not necessarily negative. For some traders, volatility can present significant profit opportunities, especially those who trade Bitcoin options. However, it is also important to consider the risks associated with the volatility and speculative nature of Bitcoin. In summary, the Bitcoin halving Volatility may increase due to shortages and increased demand, as well as changes in mining profitability. Traders can use Bitcoin options to capitalize on this volatility, but it is essential to understand the risks and have a good knowledge of how Bitcoin options work.\n\nAdoption and awareness The Bitcoin halving also generates a increased interest and awareness around cryptocurrency. The media often covers this event, which can attract new investors and increase overall Bitcoin adoption. As more people become familiar with the halving, we may see an increase in the number of people interested in learning about Bitcoin and participating in its market."

        "content": "Introduced in October 2008, Bitcoin marked a revolution in the history of global finances. This digital currency enabled peer-to-peer payment without any support or framework of financial institutions.\n\nBitcoin witnessed massive growth over the past few years. For example, its price jumped to around $20,000 during the bull market of 2017. Prices touched $60,000 in 2021 as the popularity of digital currency grew massively during the pandemic.\n\nWhat Makes Bitcoins Better Investments for the Future?\n\nBitcoin is right now the most prominent cryptocurrency worldwide in terms of market capitalisation. This digital currency has inspired the launch of several other cryptos in recent years.\n\nIt is a decentralised cryptocurrency that is not issued by any recognised banking system or by the government. This digital currency is produced through the computational powers of individuals, miners, and other groups of people involved in transaction verifications. They are then rewarded with Bitcoins.\n\nHere are the few parameters that make Bitcoins an exciting investment option for the future:\n\nTransparency and Security\n\nBitcoin transactions take place on a highly secure, decentralised, and encrypted system. The complex algorithms used on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain make it difficult to manipulate.\n\n\n\nThis makes Bitcoin one of the most secure and transparent systems for the future.\n\n\n\nWidespread Acceptance\n\nBitcoin being the largest and the oldest digital currency, is now accepted by various top global multinational companies, including Microsoft, AMC, Shopify, and more. This has further increased its legitimacy and popularity.\n\n\n\nNotably, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as its legal tender.\n\n\n\nBaseline Value\n\nIn addition to having a robust and efficient blockchain technology, Bitcoin comes with significant intrinsic value. There are still millions of individuals who don\u2019t have access to basic banking facilities.\n\n\n\nThey can use this digital currency platform to transfer money across the globe. However, Bitcoin has yet to realise its non-banking potential.\n\n\n\nFlow\n\nFor Bitcoin, the market is fairly liquid.\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoins?\n\nThere is no doubt that Bitcoin will remain the most significant player in the crypto space in the upcoming years. Crypto enthusiasts looking to invest in Bitcoins can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Investors need to set up an account on any cryptocurrency investment platform that is available.\n\nStep 2: They need to complete the identity verification process and then deposit money from their bank accounts.\n\nStep 3: Now, they can purchase the number of Bitcoins they want.\n\nIn addition to crypto exchanges, one can buy Bitcoins with selected stockbrokers and on payment apps.\n\nOnce the money from the bank account gets transferred to one\u2019s exchange account, he/she can purchase Bitcoins. Investors need to specify the amount they wish to spend to buy the coins, review all necessary transaction details, and then confirm the purchase.\n\nRisks Involved\n\nOwning a Bitcoin can be highly profitable, given the astronomical rise this crypto has registered in the past few years. This crypto is now the most famous digital currency worldwide.\n\nRegardless of the profit and upside potential involved, it can be a volatile and high-risk investment.
