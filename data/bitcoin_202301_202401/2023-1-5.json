        "title": "How to Invest in Bitcoin - Acorns",
        "content": "Bitcoin \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency that first came onto the scene in 2009, and is now one of the largest and best-known digital currencies \u2014 frequently makes headlines with its high volatility.\n\nEven with the dramatic ups and downs that Bitcoin investors weather, buying a piece of the virtual asset is one way to diversify a portfolio. Diversification involves mixing up your investments so that you have a variety of different assets in your portfolio. If you experience losses in one area of your portfolio, gains in other areas can help cushion the blow.\n\nCryptocurrency isn\u2019t the only way to diversify your portfolio, and it\u2019s important to know the pros and cons before getting started. Let\u2019s take a look at how investing in Bitcoin works so you can decide if it\u2019s the right investment for you.\n\nHow does Bitcoin work?\n\nCryptocurrency isn\u2019t issued or backed by a government entity the way the currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro are. Digital currency is completely decentralized and doesn\u2019t rely on a central bank. Instead, it runs on blockchain technology.\n\nThis is a database that\u2019s managed by a huge computer network. Bitcoin transactions are processed together as a block and added to the database. It\u2019s a permanent record that can\u2019t be edited. If you buy or sell Bitcoin at any time, it will be visible on the blockchain.\n\nThis technology also allows for secure payments between buyers and sellers \u2014 no bank or other third party is necessary, and you don\u2019t need to divulge any personal information. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your cryptocurrency investments are \u201csafe,\u201d though \u2014 there are still risks, like volatility, potential hackers, and even exchange collapse (more on that later). And cryptocurrency is not FDIC insured.\n\n3 ways to invest in Bitcoin\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in investing in Bitcoin, there are several ways to go about it, with pros and cons for each.\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nAn ETF is a basket of investments that trades like a stock. It typically tracks a market index, such as the S&P 500, and allows investors to buy a variety of securities (a term that just means types of investments you can buy and sell). What\u2019s more, ETFs can provide built-in diversification at a relatively low cost.\n\nSome ETFs carve out space for cryptocurrencies. With Acorns, for example, you can choose to allocate up to 5% of your portfolio in a Bitcoin-linked ETF. Instead of investing directly in Bitcoin, it invests in Bitcoin futures. This gives you some exposure to Bitcoin by investing in its potential value, without actually having to own a piece of the cryptocurrency itself. That\u2019s important given cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility and the other potential risks of investing directly in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin trading platforms\n\nYou can also invest in Bitcoin by buying individual coins, or pieces of coins, through cryptocurrency exchanges. Some recognizable names include Binance, OKX, and Coinbase. Some areas have Bitcoin ATMs that allow you to buy bitcoin with a credit card or cash.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know that cryptocurrency trading platforms have been in the headlines recently as several large exchanges have collapsed. Investors who use an exchange that collapses are at risk of losing their money.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve bought a piece of Bitcoin, you store it in a digital wallet. Each exchange typically offers its own crypto wallet. There are two different kinds of wallets: \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d wallets.\n\nHot wallets are connected to the internet and accessed through your phone, but can come with security risks. If a hacker gains access to your wallet, or the exchange your wallet is connected to collapses, your Bitcoin could be lost for good.\n\nA cold wallet, on the other hand, isn\u2019t connected to the internet. An external flash drive or hardware wallet are good examples of cold wallets. Cold wallets can be more secure, though accessing your Bitcoin may feel more cumbersome, and it\u2019s possible to misplace it because it\u2019s a physical item.\n\nTo access your wallet, you use a pair of virtual keys. A public key receives transactions, and a private key accesses your Bitcoin and proves your ownership. It\u2019s the only way you can retrieve your digital assets. If you lose it, there\u2019s no password recovery function to get it back, and if someone steals it, they could access your Bitcoin and transfer it elsewhere.\n\nBitcoin-related stocks\n\nAnother way to get Bitcoin exposure in your portfolio is by investing in Bitcoin-related companies that are publicly traded. Bitcoin-adjacent companies could include those that are involved in Bitcoin mining (a term that describes digitally creating new Bitcoin), the exchanges themselves, or even payment companies that support the buying and selling of Bitcoin.\n\nIf it\u2019s a public company, and it makes money by interacting in some way with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, buying shares is one way to add Bitcoin exposure to your portfolio. Of course, if that company isn\u2019t doing well, your investment could take a hit.\n\nIs Bitcoin volatile?\n\nWhen it comes to investing, there\u2019s a direct relationship between risk and return. High-risk investments can have high potential returns \u2014 but they can also have great potential for loss.\n\nIt\u2019s a balancing act. Having some exposure to risk can help investors grow their wealth and keep pace with inflation over the long term. At the same time, you may want more stable assets to mitigate risk. If you put all your savings into Bitcoin and it underperforms, what will that mean for your financial health?\n\nLike all cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is considered extremely volatile. It doubled its value in 2021, but then lost most of that gain in early 2022. The truth is that no investment is a sure thing. Diversifying your portfolio can protect you against market volatility.\n\nIs investing in Bitcoin right for you?\n\nBefore you put all your money into Bitcoin, take a step back and think about what you want to get out of investing. Your investment strategy will likely be determined by your age and risk tolerance. Your long-term financial goals are equally important.\n\nThere\u2019s a learning curve that comes with investing in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. And just like any other investment, returns are never guaranteed."

        "title": "El Salvador's Bitcoin strategy evolved with the bear market in 2022 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency adoption has been on the rise in El Salvador in recent years, with the country becoming the first in the world to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender. This landmark decision has attracted the attention of the global cryptocurrency community and has sparked discussions on the potential benefits and challenges of widespread adoption.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s controversial move with its cryptocurrency adoption would not have been possible if it was not due to President Nayib Bukele, who garnered international attention after announcing the Bitcoin adoption plan and passed it into law. The legislation required all businesses within the country to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for goods and services. As a legal tender, Bitcoin now has the same status as traditional fiat currencies, which worries other regulators, economic experts and many everyday Salvadorans.\n\nThe country\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender has made it easier for Salvadorans living abroad to send money back to their families in the country through remittances. Chivo Wallet, the official wallet of the Salvadoran government, claimed to have onboarded 2.2 million Salvadorans a month after declaring Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThis could potentially increase financial inclusion for these individuals, who previously relied on cash transactions or informal financial services. Every user who successfully downloaded the app immediately received $30 in Bitcoin. However, this massive adoption was not as smooth as hoped, as it was faced with numerous roadblocks, including missing funds, system issues and disinterest from everyday citizens.\n\nClick \u201cCollect\u201d below the illustration at the top of the page or follow this link.\n\nBukele also proposed the creation of a low-tax Bitcoin city at the base of the Conchagua volcano, which would power the city's infrastructure and crypto mining operations. The project would be funded through the sale of $1 billion worth of bonds known as Bitcoin bonds or volcano bonds, which have an annual interest rate of 6.5% and are intended to be in effect for 10 years.\n\nThe adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador has generated a lot of interest and has the potential to pave the way for the wider adoption of cryptocurrency in other countries, but it remains to be seen how this experiment will play out.\n\nWhat worked and what didn't?\n\nEl Salvador's decision to make Bitcoin legal tender has caused concern among its citizens due to the cryptocurrency's volatile nature and the uncertain success of the plan. While some parts of the implementation of Bitcoin as a legal tender went according to plan, many didn't, which resulted in some unintended consequences.\n\nEl Salvador's credit rating and ties with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have suffered as a result of Bitcoin adoption. Local borrowers have been forced to charge higher interest rates as investors have become less willing to lend to the nation. Moreover, due to the significant risks to financial and market integrity, financial stability and consumer protection, the IMF advised El Salvador to revoke Bitcoin's legal lender status due to its volatility as well as its usage in fraud and other criminal activities.\n\nRecent: Crypto companies aim to build trust within future products and services\n\nThe World Bank has also raised worries about the negative environmental effects of cryptocurrencies that El Salvador's Bitcoin strategy has brought to light.\n\nThe majority of Salvadorans still lack knowledge about Bitcoin. Despite promises of economic freedom and servicing the unbanked, blockchain tech can be clunky from a user experience perspective, and many find it easier to continue to transact in U.S. dollars.\n\nFurthermore, El Salvador is a poor country with one of the lowest rates of internet use in the Americas. There are many vendors, street hawkers and farmers who are not equipped to handle cryptocurrency transactions. Thus, the usage of Bitcoin for everyday transactions is low, despite the government's big push.\n\nHowever, the decision to open up the economy to Bitcoin has managed to attract foreign investment to the country. Carlos G. Alfaro, technical sales manager at blockchain software firm Koibanx, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cI have managed to meet several foreign investors who have come because of the Bitcoin Law but are not only investing in the blockchain industry \u2014 they are also investing in different areas such as hotels, real estate, and franchise companies.\u201d\n\nBefore the Bitcoin Law, a large portion of Salvadorans lacked a mechanism to retain their money digitally and conduct transactions with one another. Hence, the project introduced many residents to the idea of savings and investments.\n\nAnd while participation and use of Bitcoin may remain relatively low among the populace, Alfaro stated that the $30 Bitcoin reward from the Chivo Wallet has served as a catalyst to get citizens more interested in savings and investments, adding:\n\n\u201cI think that, little by little, the average citizen is finding how to use it, from having a small bank account, sending money between countries both personally and with companies, being able to save a little and learning how investments work.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s investment strategy has also become more moderate. The country has bought Bitcoin 11 times at different amounts and purchase prices based on tweets posted by Bukele himself. The latest such purchase was 80 BTC for $1.5 million on June 30, 2022, but now El Salvador is buying 1 Bitcoin per day using a dollar cost averaging strategy to minimize the impact of Bitcoin's volatility on the country's economy.\n\nExpectations for 2023 and beyond\n\nDemand for Bitcoin in El Salvador is still present, and with the announced plans to build a Bitcoin city, the country hopes to continue to attract BTC investors in the years to come.\n\nIn 2023, El Salvador is expected to expand its administrative capacities for dealing with cryptocurrency use in its economy, including addressing any possible criminal activities. Guillermo Contreras, CEO of DitoBanx, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cIn this sense, there has been a lot of openness, cooperation and communication between the different government institutions and the companies that are operating under this heading, and now precisely this issue is being further consolidated with the opening of the National Bitcoin Office that will function as a central entity to deal with all issues related to it.\u201d\n\nThe new Digital Assets Issuance Law, which will be implemented in 2023, permits the issuing of El Salvador's Bitcoin bonds to fund the infrastructure of the Bitcoin city and buy more Bitcoin. This law will also permit the development of blockchain-based business models in a controlled setting.\n\nRecent: Redeeming physical NFTs: Easier said than done?\n\nEl Salvador continues to take concrete steps so that Bitcoin will be incorporated into financial literacy programs across the country. In 2023, the country\u2019s Ministry of Education is expected to address educational concerns at a mass level with a training module in financial education that incorporates updated content such as cryptocurrencies and electronic wallets.\n\nContreras concluded: \u201cThe implementation of Bitcoin and digital wallets allowed more than four million people to safeguard their money, receive money from remittances and other sources safely and instantly. At the beginning, of course, there was a feeling of fear of the unknown, but fortunately, El Salvador had already experienced something similar when we adopted the U.S. dollar as legal tender instead of the Salvadoran colones. It is a process that took a bit of time, but finally users were able to confirm that it was real money just like any other currency, and although there are still some challenges to overcome, the path is well marked and there is a good perspective.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, closed last year with a loss of more than 60%. Additionally, the mining industry suffered from BTC's sharp price declines, with revenues falling 37.5% in 2022 to $9.55 billion.\n\nBitcoin Miners' Revenue Took a Dive in 2022\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, mining revenues stood at $15.3 billion in 2021. However, the high-profile collapse of the TerraUSD ecosystem in May and the FTX crypto exchange in November negatively affected the industry as a whole.\n\nMoreover, rising interest rates worldwide have increased pressure on risk assets, including equities. Cryptocurrencies, which are highly correlated with the stock market, have also begun to lose, negatively affecting the condition of digital assets mining companies.\n\nThe miners' daily revenue index reached a record high of $63 million in November 2021. However, by the end of 2022, it was at only $16 million, recording a very dynamic depreciation.\n\nKeep Reading OKX Joins Growing List of Crypto Exchanges with Singapore's MPI License\n\nDoug Brooks\n\nAccording to Doug Brooks, a Senior Advisor at XinFin Foundation, there are three main drivers for the strong decline in revenues: large increase in energy prices, lower value of Proof of Work currencies like Bitcoin and rising competition.\n\n\"There are more miners than ever now, some are even publicly listed companies, so there is less bounty for each miner since the pot size is limited,\" Brooks commented.\n\nBTC Miners' Debts Grow\n\nAs revenues and profitability declined, Bitcoin miners found it increasingly difficult to repay their liabilities. According to Luxor data, the debt-to-equity ratio has tripled for many popular and publicly listed mining companies.\n\nFor Core Scientific, one of the BTC miners from Wall Street, the ratio reached 26.7. In addition, Argo Blockchain (NASDAQ:ARBK), one of the world's largest miners, increased its debt, with the debt-to-equity ratio jumping to 8.7.\n\nBTC Miners Dept-to-Equity Rartio\n\nCore Scientific was $1.3 billion in debt as of 30 September 2022, ultimately leading to a bankruptcy filing. On the other hand, Greenidge and Stronghold decided to restructure their current liabilities. The total debt among the ten miners analyzed by Luxor reached nearly $3.5 billion.\n\nWill 2023 bring more debt and bankruptcies? According to Brooks, it \"can most certainly be expected in the mining industry this year, particularly if the prices of BTC and other PoW-based currencies drop even further.\"\n\n\"Any significant reduction in energy prices is not apparent and conversion to a more sustainable and cost-effective energy source, where possible, would take time and be costly. Many miners are already operating near or below break-even levels, so their survival until any significant price bounce must be in doubt. Any further increase in cost or reductions in revenues will accelerate the shutting down of those in the weakest positions,\" Brooks added.\n\nSignificant Losses of Bitcoin Mining Companies\n\nAlthough the largest publicly traded mining companies have not yet released their reports for the fourth quarter and the entire year of 2022, the most recent trading updates and third-quarter reports showed a significant deterioration in the industry's health.\n\nCanaan Inc. (NASDAQ:CAN), a cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturer, reported a significant drop in revenue and net income in November. During the three-month period that ended on 30 September 2022, the computing solutions provider achieved a revenue of $137.5 million, which is 26% lower than in 2021. On top of that, net income slid 90% quarter-over-quarter to $8.6 million.\n\nBitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF), a cryptocurrency mining company, reported a decline in revenue in the same quarter, despite rising BTC production. The company mined 1,515 BTC in the third quarter, nearly 500 more than a year earlier.\n\nArgo Blockchain found itself on the brink of bankruptcy Bankruptcy Bankruptcy or insolvency constitutes a legal term and refers to being unable to repay debts. A business and a person can declare bankruptcy. When a person or company claims bankruptcy, it is described as a voluntary bankruptcy, and when your debtors force you into bankruptcy, it is referred to as involuntary.

It clearly shows that despite the harsh conditions, the industry's competition has constantly been increasing.\n\nBitcoin Network Mining Difficulty\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, it took 24 trillion hashes (TH) to generate a brand new Bitcoin, while 12 months later, the indicator reached a new all-time high of 37 TH. Since then, the difficulty of mining has decreased slightly to 35 TH but remains in the range of record highs."

        "title": "Noise Pollution from Crypto Mining is Destroying This Town - Popular Mechanics",
        "content": "It was nearly midnight in late April when Lynell Morris\u2019s husband, Michael, returned home after a shift at work.\n\nAs he fumbled his keys, the motion-sensing light on their front doorstep flicked on. His eye caught a glint of gold: a .22 bullet on his doormat. It seemed odd as he and Lynell own a different-\u200bcaliber firearm. Nevertheless, he brought it inside and set it on their kitchen table.\n\nA few days later, he remembered to ask Lynell about it. Immediately, she yelped, \u201cPolitics!\u201d Neither Lynell nor Michael is running for office. But over the last few months, Lynell had become enmeshed in local politics after a cryptocurrency mine set up shop in their town of Murphy, North Carolina, in September 2021. \u201cMine\u201d is a misnomer, as these facilities are clusters of computing units, solving complex problems to help transact and generate virtual currency, with large\u2014and noisy\u2014fans to cool them.\n\nSitting in the foothills of the Appalachian and Blue Ridge Mountains, Murphy is a lush oasis promising an uninterrupted soundtrack of nature, and attracting those who value that quiet. Within weeks of when the mine began running, angry residents started complaining about the incessant noise on Facebook and Nextdoor. They likened this new, pervasive sound to a highway, a jet engine on the runway, or a semi idling in their driveway, and said it was disrupting their sleep and eroding their sense of peace.\n\nThe Morrises are lucky. They only hear the mine from their home when there\u2019s no other noise outside. But Lynell was frustrated by her neighbors\u2019 stories and began speaking out on their behalf at bimonthly county commissioner meetings. \u201cI take up for the underdogs,\u201d she says. Lynell has always been a leader. Before moving to Murphy three years ago with the intent to retire there, she ran a small business with her husband. And, as she puts it: \u201cI was blessed with a mouth.\u201d\n\nLynell ran her mouth on April 18, at the Cherokee County (Murphy is the county seat) board of commissioners meeting. More than six months had passed since the mine began causing a disturbance, and she was fed up with the lack of transparency from her elected officials, who had yet to act upon the concerns of their citizens. Residents have three minutes to make a statement during the public comment period at these meetings. Lynell took the podium and spoke for more than 20 minutes, pressing the commissioners on why they\u2019re backing the mine and what they\u2019re planning to do to mitigate the noise.\n\nAfter the bullet appeared on her doorstep, she wondered if she had said too much. \u201cI\u2019m a Southern girl. I don\u2019t scare easily,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a threat, nevertheless.\u201d\n\nJuan Diego Reyes Murphy resident Lynell Morris. Juan Diego Reyes The bullet found on her front step.\n\nThe Sound of Cryptocurrency\n\nFollow Highway 64\u2014or as the residents call it, the four-lane\u2014east from town for about three miles. Turn right on Harshaw Place and left on Harshaw Road at the stop sign. Drive parallel to the highway for about half a mile, and you\u2019ll see it on your left: large white boxes housing blue containers in a cornfield, partially surrounded by a gray wall. It looks out of place in western North Carolina, something so modern.\n\nAs you approach the mine, which is owned by the San Francisco-based firm PrimeBlock, you begin to hear the roar. During the day, its low-frequency hum\u2014which, directly outside, may go up to 95 decibels\u2014can make it seem like you\u2019re next to a running motorcycle. From the mine, roads weave like a spider\u2019s web. Harshaw Road continues east. Back at the stop sign, Mulkey Place goes straight. The two are bisected by Club House Road, which then turns into Poor House Mountain Trail. All the streets wind with hairpin turns up into the lush hills, splitting into side streets. Many houses off Harshaw, Mulkey, and Poor House Mountain surround what used to be the 18-hole Cherokee Hills Golf and Country Club, which closed at the end of 2016.\n\nSound travels in waves and tends to travel farthest in open landscapes. And low-frequency sounds, like the rumble from the crypto mine, travel farther than high-frequency sounds (think: a scream, or nails on a chalkboard) because the longer waves of a low-frequency noise cover more ground before losing energy. In Murphy, residents who can hear the indelible hum most prominently live near an unobstructed path from it. During winter, the noise gets worse without leaves on trees to help absorb the sound. But year-round, residents living up to a mile away from the mine can hear it.\n\nIn December, Lynell and fellow resident Cyndie Roberson started a private Facebook group for people to share their experiences and grievances. In a town of about 1,855 people, up to 800 families live within a mile of the mine.\n\nMany residents have installed apps on their phone to track the sound levels. It\u2019s so loud that Gene Johnson, whose ears were damaged during his stint in the military and who now wears hearing aids, can still hear the low rumble when the aids come out. He lives on Beaver Ridge Trail, which breaks off Harshaw immediately after you pass the mine. It\u2019s so loud that Mike and Jennifer Lugiewicz, who lived two houses down from the mine, could watch but not hear their neighbor mow their lawn. (They have since moved to be farther from the mine.) The din can hide the sound of cars, so now Shannon Coleman helps her mom, who lives a half mile past the mine on Harshaw, retrieve the mail from her box across the street on a blind turn. Her mother, who is legally blind, can\u2019t discern the sound of an oncoming car from the sound of the mine, and fears getting hit.\n\nJuan Diego Reyes Murphy resident Gene Johnson says he can still hear the mine without his hearing aids.\n\nThe noise, residents say, is especially terrible at night and early in the morning, when it wakes them up. Some say it\u2019s caused them to become depressed and anxious. They\u2019ve been showing up, as Lynell has, to county commissioners meetings bedraggled, frustrated, and angry that their elected officials have done very little to protect their health.\n\nPatricia Callahan lives in the townhouses on Club House Road. Her unit is the closest to the mine, about a quarter mile away as the crow flies.\n\nCallahan moved to Murphy three years ago, after completing a work-study program at the John Campbell Folk School, an artisan school for adults just outside Murphy, in Brasstown. Her youngest had just left for college, and Callahan was looking for a spot where she could retire. She was taken by Murphy\u2019s art scene, but more importantly, the tranquility, and decided to buy in Murphy. After her real estate agent showed her the townhouse, Callahan sat outside at its picnic table and thought, \u201cI have found my peace and quiet.\u201d\n\nThose qualities were crucial for Callahan. A car accident 15 years ago left her with a brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. \u201cI arranged my life to keep my stress low,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole body will go into a hypervigilant fight-or-flight mode when I\u2019m around too much noise.\u201d\n\nWhen the mine came online last fall, Calla han\u2019s way of life was upended. She used to open the windows at night to cool her bedroom (she prefers not to use air conditioning because she lives on a strict budget), but she must close her windows now to lower the noise. Even that, along with wearing noise-canceling headphones, is not enough. The only time she\u2019s been able to get a good night\u2019s sleep is when she\u2019s in a hotel or camping.\n\nThe noise is a constant, Callahan says. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just my hearing. It affects my whole body, triggering PTSD symptoms,\u201d she says. Many older residents with underlying health issues who have retired in Murphy express a similar sentiment: The noise and sleep interruptions caused by the mine are making their conditions worse.\n\nCallahan says she can\u2019t sell her house to move somewhere quieter. \u201cNothing is within my budget,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trapped here.\u201d\n\nMining New Money\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital form of currency that can be used like cash or a credit card. Unlike the U.S. dollar, there is no central authority that prints more coins, or maintains the value of a cryptocurrency. This lack of oversight and regulation is appealing to many who wish to grow their wealth without traditional banking institutions.\n\nBitcoin became the first viable cryptocurrency in 2009, and over the last 13 years, demand for cryptocurrencies has only skyrocketed. Now, there are more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies valued around $1 trillion in total, and a 2021 Pew Research study found that one in six Americans use them. \u201cThere is a general movement of making finance more for the people,\u201d Matteo Benetton, PhD, an assistant professor of finance at University of California, Berkeley, says of cryptocurrency\u2019s appeal. Cryptocurrency mining is computers solving complex algorithms to record crypto transactions that prevent people from spending their currency more than once. After a certain amount of work, a mine is paid in newly created cryptocurrency. This computing relies on an astronomical amount of power. The Murphy mine, according to Scott Wade, the head of operations at Exponential Digital, the company that operates the mine and was acquired by PrimeBlock last January, uses anywhere from 5 to 15 megawatts annually, enough to power up to 13,500 homes. (A gaming laptop, by comparison, would use 0.02 megawatts running year-round.)\n\nJuan Diego Reyes The PrimeBlock crypto currency mine on October 14, 2022. A section of the partial enclosure can be seen in the background.\n\nUp until 2021, most of the world\u2019s crypto mines were housed in China. But when the country banned the use and mining of cryptocurrency that fall\u2014largely because of the Chinese government\u2019s fear that cryptocurrencies are a gateway to financial crime and have a negative impact on the environment\u2014miners flocked to the U.S. According to the Bitcoin Mining Map developed by the University of Cambridge in the U.K., the U.S. now makes up the majority of the total global hashrate, or the computational power processing cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nIn the U.S., crypto companies generally set up shop in places like the Finger Lakes region in upstate New York, eastern Washington, South Dakota, and towns like Murphy along the Tennessee Valley. They all offer cheap electricity, and often, mines can be built in repurposed factories.\n\nNot only is noise pollution an issue, but the annual electricity use worldwide from exclusively mining Bitcoin\u2014just one type of crypto currency\u2014is extensive. Some studies estimate it can even exceed that of entire countries. This overall higher community electricity use raises the cost for residents.\n\nThe Pain of Noise Pollution\n\nBecause cryptocurrency is relatively new, there are few peer-reviewed studies that specifically link it to how its mines affect human health and the environment. Twenty-\u200btwo state legislators have written to the EPA to monitor the environmental impact of mining cryptocurrency. But noise is the primary complaint in Murphy, and plenty is known about how loud, persistent, low-frequency sounds can lead to a host of problems.\n\nIn the 1970s, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Noise Abatement and Control recognized noise as a pollutant and began taking steps to limit community exposure. Through the now-defunct office, researchers determined that, to ensure their health and welfare, residents shouldn\u2019t be exposed to more than an average of 55 decibels over the course of a day. Anything higher, in terms of sound level or length of exposure, could increase an individual\u2019s chances of hearing loss. Even though the world around us has gotten noisier since then\u2014particularly in cities and largely due to industrial noise\u2014our ears can\u2019t adapt accordingly, says Deanna Meinke, PhD, an audiologist who studies dangerous decibels at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley.\n\nOver the last few decades, researchers have seen that prolonged exposure to noise can lead to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues, and even exacerbate mental health disorders. What\u2019s more, noise pollution can be more detrimental at night, when our bodies are much more vulnerable to sounds during sleep.\n\nAnd sound-level guidelines for health impacts beyond hearing loss don\u2019t yet exist. \u201cWe don\u2019t have limits for a noise level that would prevent heart attacks, or prevent high blood pressure, or prevent depression,\u201d says Rick Neitzel, PhD, a noise pollution expert at the University of Michigan.\n\nIn 2020, an international team of researchers published a study in European Heart Journal where they followed about 500 healthy adults for five years. They found that every five-decibel increase over a baseline 45 decibels for a 24-hour span was associated with a 34 percent jump in heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular issues.\n\nAnd in the early 1990s, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sponsored several studies to determine how loud an airport could be without making residents seriously annoyed. They found that about half of the residents reached that threshold of annoyance when exposed to an average of 75 decibels over a 24-hour period, although they didn\u2019t characterize how that manifested in health impacts. But about 20 years later, a group of German researchers tracked over 2,300 residents who lived in the flight path of Frankfurt Airport, and found that the individuals who reported to be \u201cstrongly annoyed\u201d by the noise were twice as likely as others to feel depressed or anxious.\n\nResearchers have seen that prolonged exposure to noise can lead to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues, and exacerbate mental health disorders.\n\nJuan Diego Reyes Downtown Murphy, North Carolina.\n\nThe annoyance and resulting stress that Callahan and her neighbors face shouldn\u2019t be discounted, says Neitzel. \u201cAnnoyance is a huge byproduct of noise exposure, and we don\u2019t really understand how important that is in terms of putting someone at risk.\u201d\n\nWhen noise becomes a stressor\u2014as it has been in Murphy\u2014it activates the adrenal system, which not only responds to stress but also regulates an individual\u2019s immune and cardiovascular system. \u201cIt\u2019s not good to spend 8, 10, or 12 hours a day in that condition,\u201d Neitzel says. It can drive up heart rate and blood pressure, and cause problems down the line.\n\nEnvironmental Exodus\n\nAs soon as the mine came online, residents in the surrounding neighborhood began noticing changes in animal behavior. Ronny and Kathy Williams, who live atop Poor House Mountain Trail, lament the decline of birds in their backyard, where they keep multiple feeders. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen very few goldfinches this year. The house finches came and went. And I\u2019ve only seen one Carolina wren this year,\u201d Ronny says.\n\nMeanwhile, Phyllis Cantrell, who lives about as far from the mine as the Williamses, has noted that hawks and eagles no longer nest nearby. The hummingbird feeders on her deck she used to refill four times a day are now going three days before she replenishes them. The area near the mine used to be prime habitat for wild turkey and deer. Now, they\u2019re moving farther up the mountains. Morris, for instance, has recently found deer in her backyard for the first time.\n\nA herd of horses that live on a patch of land across from the mine on Harshaw have been trying to flee more frequently, too, according to the Lugiewiczes, who live across from where they\u2019re kept. On a warm weekend last December, on a day when the fans from the mine were especially loud, Jennifer and Shannon Coleman spent an hour trying to wrangle the horses\u2014who seemed spooked by the noise\u2014all the while shouting over the din, standing just five feet away from each other. And dogs begin howling, says Cantrell, when the mine is especially loud at night.\n\nResearch shows that hundreds of animal species are affected by noise, says Clinton D. Francis, PhD, an evolutionary ecologist who studies noise pollution at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.\n\nThe ability to perceive sounds and respond is a part of a \u201cuniversal threat detection system\u201d across vertebrates, he says. \u201cHearing is used to passively listen for threats while we\u2019re doing other things.\u201d\n\nThe impact of noise pollution is perhaps best characterized for birds. They may modify their songs to be at a higher pitch or sing more frequently to stand out amid the noise. Some field research shows that about a third of birds may completely leave an area because of noise pollution, with major ecological consequences. In 2012, Francis and his colleagues published a study that showed low-frequency industrial noise from gas wells and compressors (clocking in at around 95 decibels) reshaped areas of the Rattlesnake Canyon Habitat Management Area in northwestern New Mexico. Birds there are critical in dispersing seeds of the Colorado pinyon pine. And now, some preliminary research from Francis\u2019s group suggests that noise pollution may lead to inheritable changes in specific species and populations. In other words: Noisy enterprises like crypto mines can alter the wildlife near it for generations to come.\n\nBut Francis is heartened by the fact that when the source of noise is removed, animals reclaim where they once lived. Think back to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, when the songs of the white-crowned sparrows in San Francisco grew more frequent when the din of the city subsided, or lions napped along traffic-free roads in South Africa.\n\nJuan Diego Reyes Beaver Ridge Trail loops around the neighborhood next to the mine.\n\nLax Zoning Laws and Few Answers\n\nDespite the annoyance, the deleterious health effects, and the damage to the ecosystem, there\u2019s no legal protection for the residents of Murphy due to scant zoning laws in Cherokee County, which would otherwise protect residential areas from industrial development. Already, there are three mines in the county, and citizens fear more may be coming.\n\nSome Murphy residents have left because of the noise from the mine. Others who have put their life savings into their idyllic mountain home have no choice but to fight for change and show up to the commissioners meetings in droves. So far, the residents\u2019 concerns about noise mostly have fallen on deaf ears. They\u2019re also frustrated by the lack of answers from their five commissioners as to how the mine ended up there in the first place. They\u2019re trying to get their elected officials to enforce a 1999 county ordinance under which perpetrators are fined $50 a day for sustained noise above 50 decibels. But the commissioners say that the ordinance is unenforceable without the zoning laws that Cherokee County lacks.\n\nAnd without zoning laws, it\u2019s impossible for anyone to find a legal standing to hold anyone accountable. In Limestone, Tennessee, where the cryptocurrency company Red Dog set up shop, residents had recourse because Red Dog violated an existing zoning ordinance. That county sued and won. The mine is set to shut down by the end of 2024, pay associated penalties, and relocate away from a residential area.\n\nThe Cherokee County board of commissioners\u2014particularly Dan Eichenbaum, Gary Westmoreland, and Randy Phillips, who locals refer to as \u201cthe triad\u201d for their similar voting patterns on controversial issues\u2014are not keen on changing the status quo. None responded to comment on this story. And amid the calls for zoning reform, a quieter contingent of Murphy residents don\u2019t want any government interference in land use or rights.\n\nSince the Murphy mine was set up last fall, it was partially enclosed by wall sections in February, but locals say that only made the sound worse, as the openings between the walls funnel sound in very specific directions. Wade, of Exponential Digital, said that this partial enclosure helps them \u201cmaintain and preserve natural cooling and airflow, resulting in a more energy- efficient operation while further mitigating sound.\u201d Moving forward, Wade says, the company will work closely with the commissioners to ensure the facility doesn\u2019t generate more noise.\n\nFor now, Morris hopes that this year\u2019s election will help, as the residents can vote for someone who will make decisions in their interests. \u201cUntil you get the commissioners behind this and really start pushing for it, change isn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt starts with them.\u201d\n\nSince the bullet on her doorstep, Morris has taken a backseat at the meetings, but she\u2019s still attending and staying engaged. Already, not even a year out, she\u2019s tired, and looking forward to what\u2014eventually\u2014could come after the mine. For her, it means peace and quiet, and the paradise that Murphy promised."

        "content": "Marathon Digital Holdings Announces Bitcoin Production and Mining Operation Updates for December 2022\n\n- Achieved a New Record in Quarterly BTC Production\n\n\n\n- Produced 475 BTC in December 2022, 1,562 BTC in Q4 2022, and 4,144 BTC In Fiscal Year 2022\n\n- Increased Unrestricted Cash to $103.7 Million and Unrestricted Bitcoin Holdings to 7,815 BTC as of December 31\n\n\n\nLAS VEGAS, Jan. 05, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) (\"Marathon\" or \"Company\"), a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, today published unaudited bitcoin (\u201cBTC\u201d) production and miner installation updates for December 2022.\n\nManagement Commentary\n\n\u201cIn 2022, we made significant progress in increasing our hash rate while also transitioning to more sustainable power sources,\u201d said Fred Thiel, Marathon\u2019s Chairman and CEO. \u201cDespite challenges earlier in the year, we doubled our hash rate to 7.0 exahashes per second year-over-year, with a majority of it now located at the King Mountain wind farm in West Texas. We finished the year with one of our most productive quarters to date, producing 1,562 bitcoin in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cIn December, we expanded our agreement with Applied Digital to deploy roughly 12,000 S19 XPs, which are approximately 30% more energy efficient than the prior generation of servers, at their Jamestown facility in North Dakota. This site is already constructed and operational, and our expectation is for miners to come online within the next month. In Garden City, installations of miners remain underway, as we now have roughly 2.1 exahashses installed and pending energization.\n\n\u201cWe also took proactive measures to strengthen our liquidity position and enhance the performance of our mining fleet. Given the macroeconomic uncertainty heading into 2023, we decided to fully pay down outstanding balances under our revolving credit agreement. This freed up bitcoin that was previously held as collateral, increasing our unrestricted bitcoin holdings from 4,200 BTC as of November 30 to 7,815 BTC (approximately $129.3 million) as of December 31. We finished the year with $103.7 million in cash on hand.\n\n\u201cDuring December, we tested overclocking and underclocking servers and began researching dual-phase immersion cooling systems. We also continued working with the new operator of the King Mountain site on improving operations and the curtailment strategy to optimize production. These efforts position us to develop our competitive advantages further and become a more efficient and resilient business as we continue to grow.\n\n\u201cAs we enter 2023, we remain confident in our ability to scale Marathon into one of the largest and most energy efficient Bitcoin mining operations globally. We have thousands of miners ready to be energized over the coming months, which we expect to more than triple our current production capacity to approximately 23 exahashes by mid-year.\u201d\n\nRecent Highlights\n\nProduced 475 BTC in December 2022 and 1,562 BTC in Q4 2022\n\nProduced 4,144 BTC in fiscal year 2022, a 30% increase from 3,197 BTC produced in fiscal year 2021\n\nAs of January 1, operating mining fleet consisted of approximately 69,000 active miners, capable of producing approximately 7.0 EH/s\n\n2.1 EH/s is currently pending energization after 1,000 S19 XPs were installed in December\n\nDepending on Applied Digital\u2019s energization timeline, the Company expects to have between 12.0 EH/s and 15.0 EH/s online by March 31, 2023\n\nReduced revolver borrowings from $30 million as of November 30 to $0 as of December 31, 2022\n\nUnrestricted bitcoin holdings on December 31, 2022 were approximately 7,815 BTC with a fair market value of approximately $129.3 million\n\nTotal bitcoin holdings increased to 12,232 BTC as of December 31, 2022\n\nUnrestricted cash on hand was approximately $103.7 million at December 31, 2022\n\n\n\nTechnology Update\n\nIn November, Marathon began an immersion-cooled pilot project, which involves submerging Bitcoin mining servers in a dielectric fluid to determine if the Company can improve the efficiency and/or performance of its operations. In December, Marathon\u2019s team successfully increased the hash rate of an S19 J Pro by 20% while reducing its power draw on a per terahash basis by approximately 4%. The Company also increased the hash rate of an S19 XP by 20%, marginally increasing the number of joules per terahash from 21.5 to 23.7 joules per terahash.\n\nMarathon is routinely looking for ways to stay ahead of the technology curve, and our latest exploration is into the potential benefits of dual-phase immersion. Our initial findings suggest that this technology could reduce capital expenditure on servers by approximately 10% versus traditional air-cooled setups and almost 7% compared to single-phase immersion systems. This is achieved by eliminating the need for aluminum chassis, heat synchs, and other parts, which are no longer required in dual-phase immersion cooling. In addition, energy consumption may also be reduced by approximately 7% versus single-phase immersion systems, as dual-phase immersion increases the heat density by 2.5 times, enabling more servers to be racked closely together.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if such improvements in performance can be consistently replicated and implemented at scale, the Company is encouraged by these preliminary results and their ability to potentially increase Marathon\u2019s competitive advantages.\n\nMiner Energization and Installations Updates\n\nAccording to the latest information made publicly available, construction of facilities and installation of miners at Applied Digital\u2019s data center sites remain underway as Applied Digital awaits regulatory approval to energize its newest facilities.\n\nIn December, Marathon secured an additional 33 megawatts of hosting capacity with Applied Digital at its Jamestown, North Dakota facility. As a result of this new arrangement the Company expects to deploy approximately 12,000 S19 XPs in the coming month as this site is fully constructed and has the necessary requirements for energization.\n\nAs of December 31, Marathon\u2019s operating fleet consists of approximately 69,000 bitcoin servers, theoretically capable of producing approximately 7.0 EH/s when operating at full capacity. An additional 2.1 EH/s is currently pending energization after an additional 1,000 S19 XPs were successfully installed in Texas during the month of December.\n\nOnce all of Marathon\u2019s previously purchased miners are installed, approximately 66% of the Company\u2019s hash rate is expected to be generated by S19 XPs, which are approximately 30% more energy efficient that the prior generation of mining servers. The Company still expects to have approximately 23 EH/s of capacity installed near the middle of 2023.\n\nInvestor Notice\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and forward-looking statements described under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2022. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that event, the value of our securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future.

        "content": "David Zell is a co-founder of the Bitcoin Policy Institute and Director of Policy at BTC Inc. In this interview, we discuss how the Bitcoin Policy Institute engages to educate politicians in DC through combating FUD, distinguishing Bitcoin from crypto, and aligning Bitcoin with US National Security interests and American values.\n\n- - - -\n\nBitcoin was developed on the shoulders of the cypherpunks building new forms of money outside of government control and oversight. Permission was not sought, as permission would not have been granted. Government actively disrupted the cypherpunk vision, seeking to destroy it. Bitcoin\u2019s emergence was therefore antithetical to the concerns and endorsement of decision-makers.\n\nBut, some believe that the initial battle has been won. Bitcoin is now 14 years old. It has spread to all corners of the globe, and radically changed the mindset of those who have interacted with it. This includes some of those in the corridors of power, who have been won over by its ideology and technical resilience. The question now is how Bitcoin development continues.\n\nBitcoin could continue to evolve without seeking to engage with the levers of the state. Experience suggests that this would marginalise Bitcoin and Bitcoiners within the US. In the meantime, other protocols and blockchains would continue to curry favour with lawmakers and mould the regulatory framework to their needs. Who would win in this situation?\n\nOr, through advocacy and education and cooperation with those in DC, Bitcoin could be allowed to develop openly within the United States. Much like the internet, the risks posed by this new innovation wouldn\u2019t be allowed to throttle the huge benefits it has to offer both individuals and society.\n\nIn a grand scenario, Bitcoin could allow the United States to continue to compete for hegemonic power whilst continuing to champion individual freedom and sovereignty. This is a huge prize. Perhaps the biggest prize. This is why there are people willing to put in the hard graft to develop and nurture bodies like the Bitcoin Policy Institute. The future owes them gratitude."

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin with Apple Pay? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency exchanges are introducing various ways to buy Bitcoin (BTC) using the Apple Pay payment method. This comes as a good move for Bitcoin adoption since the Apple Pay digital wallet accounts for more than 507 million mobile wallet downloads and a dominating market share of 43.5% in the United States mobile payments market.\n\nThis ability to now integrate and buy Bitcoin with Apple Pay paves new crypto opportunities for iPhone users. This article explains how to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using Apple Pay.\n\nWhat is Apple Pay digital wallet?\n\nApple Pay, introduced in 2014, is a mobile payment service for web payments using iOS and is supported by Apple products. It is most commonly used as an Apple Pay application on iPhones and Apple watches. It allows users to pay for music, movies and apps with one simple touch.\n\nWith the introduction of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, offline stores are also now accepting Apple Pay leading to a surge in Apple Pay contactless payments. NFC is a proximity-based wireless connectivity technology that utilizes magnetic fields to enable communication between devices when they are brought near each other. Apple Pay is supported by thousands of apps and offline stores worldwide, allowing users to purchase numerous goods and services, as well as buy Bitcoin with their iPhone and Apple Watch using NFC.\n\nVarious ways to buy Bitcoin with Apple Pay\n\nWhile Apple does not directly have a Bitcoin or crypto integration on its devices, many popular applications and platforms facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency. Here are the various ways to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay.\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Apple Pay through Coinbase\n\nCoinbase is a U.S.-based crypto trading and investment platform which offers a range of services and enables users to buy, sell, exchange and store cryptocurrencies. Coinbase has been expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency space through partnerships with major giants like Visa and Mastercard for offering on and off ramp crypto trading through instant purchases with credit and debit cards.\n\nTo enable a more convenient option for iOS users, Coinbase in June 2021 introduced the purchase of Bitcoin using Apple Pay linked to a debit card. However, selling crypto and cashing out options are not available with this mode yet.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay on Coinbase\n\nLogin to the Coinbase account on the website or app using a device supporting Apple Pay. Select Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency options. Enter the amount of Bitcoin to be purchased in the \u201cBuy BTC\u201d option. Select Apple Pay from the list of available payment methods. Confirm Bitcoin purchase using Apple Pay.\n\nIt is important to note that Apple Pay will appear automatically as a payment option if a Visa or Mastercard debit card is linked to the underlying Apple Pay digital wallet. If not, ensure to do so first before following the above steps.\n\nThe limit to purchase BTC using Apple Pay on Coinbase is dependent on the sum of the debit card\u2019s transaction limit and Coinbase limits and also subject to change as per policy, geographical region and location. One can check these limits in the Coinbase app under Settings ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) can also be purchased using Apple Pay on Coinbase in a similar fashion.\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Apple Pay on Binance\n\nBinance first introduced and started providing Apple Pay integration to buy cryptocurrencies using credit and debit cards only to citizens of the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area (EEA). In December 2022, Binance announced Apple Pay (for debit cards only) to deposit USD and purchase crypto for U.S. account holders.\n\nThis opens avenues to not only purchase but also make Bitcoin and crypto investments using Apple Pay on Binance.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay on Binance\n\nLogin to the Binance app on your iOS device. Click on \u201cWallet,\u201d select U.S. dollar and deposit USD. Click \u201cAdd Payment Method\u201d and add Apple Pay.\n\nEnter the amount of USD and tap \u201cDeposit.\u201d Add Apple Pay as the chosen payment method.\n\nProceed to purchase BTC or other cryptocurrencies with this deposit.\n\nIt is important to note that Apple Pay for the U.S. will only work for debit card integrations, while for U.K. and EEA, a credit card is an additional option. Also, there is a 3.75% fee applied to the deposit amount when using Apple Pay in the U.S. and approx 2% per transaction in the United Kingdom, subject to change as per policy. Users must ensure to check fee changes on the exchange they transact with.\n\nBuy Bitcoin using Apple Pay on BitPay\n\nBitPay is the largest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment service provider based in Atlanta, Georgia. It allows businesses, merchants and institutions to accept cryptocurrency payments and convert them to fiat currencies. BitPay gained massive popularity as it charges merchants flat 1%transaction fees in comparison to credit cards which are known to charge higher fees ranging to 3% and sometimes more.\n\nBitPay added Apple Pay in 2021 as a payment option to allow its users to buy, exchange and shop with BTC and other cryptocurrencies using Apple Pay digital wallet. BitPay does not allow in-app crypto purchases yet, but contactless crypto purchases using NFC are possible in-store and online using Apple Pay on supported devices.\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin, BitPay also supports popular stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) and BinanceUSD (BUSD) for Apple Pay purchases. Users need to add their BitPay crypto debit card to Apple Pay and then can use Bitcoin to make purchases wherever Apple Pay is accepted globally. BitPay partnered with Simplex and Wyre to enable these Apple Pay payments.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay on BitPay\n\nLogin to the BitPay app. Load BTC on your BitPay debit card. Add the BitPay Card to Apple Pay in the BitPay App.\n\nUse the BitPay card BTC funds to make purchases using Apple Pay.\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Apple Pay using MetaMask\n\nMetaMask, the Ethereum cryptocurrency wallet provider, also now allows users to purchase cryptocurrencies via Apple Pay. MetaMask announced its Apple Pay support in April 2022. Since this is not an integration with Apple directly, MetaMask users are redirected to Wyre, allowing them to make the payment via credit/debit card or through Apple Pay. Wyre is a cryptocurrency exchange that offers crypto to fiat via API and integrates with Apple Pay.\n\nMetaMask allows its Apple Pay users a maximum daily deposit limit of $400 into their wallet and charges a gas fee as well as its own transaction fees (0.875% of the transaction amount). Moreover, purchasing crypto through MetaMask allows users to use it across different decentralized applications (DApps) and Web3 services where MetaMask is available. However, in-store contactless purchases are still not available through this method.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin using Apple Pay through MetaMask\n\nLogin to your MetaMask account on browser or app. Set up Apple Pay via the app. Ensure Know Your Customer on the card connected with Apple Pay. Tap \u201cAdd Funds,\u201d click \u201cBuy BTC\u201d and input the amount. Select Apple Pay as the payment method. Authenticate and complete the transaction.\n\nWhile the above four methods are quite known, there are many other wallets, exchanges and platforms where one can avail the benefits of buying Bitcoin with Apple Pay including and not limited to Exodus, Paxful, CEX.io, Lumi Wallet, Crypto.com and more. Users must acquaint themselves with terms, conditions, fees and others before selecting their preferred method.\n\nShould you buy crypto with Apple Pay?\n\nThere is no straight answer to whether or not users should choose to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using the Apple Pay method. However, there are both benefits and drawbacks to doing so.\n\nThe positives include quick, easy and straightforward transactions. Apple Pay\u2019s contactless payment method technology makes it a preferred payment method among millennials and Gen Z users in the United States. Apple Pay statistics claim that its contactless payment method is accepted by 85% of U.S. retailers for fiat payments. This user preference is also reflected by the multitude of crypto platforms, exchanges and wallets that are bringing in contactless Apple Pay integrations.\n\nHowever, the negatives to watch for include the threat of monetary loss due to scams, hacks and malware as well as crypto volatility which may incur frequent fluctuations in prices while making purchases. Therefore, users must make informed decisions and do thorough research before using various crypto payment methods available in the market."

They likewise use standard deviation to determine the upper and lower bounds of price action within a defined period. Multiple use cases arise, including the ability to assess comparatively volatile or nonvolatile price action, as well as associated entry and exit points.\n\nCurrently, the two bands are \u201csqueezed\u201d around the central moving average on BTC/USD, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows, leading to assumptions that volatility should now ensue.\n\nFor creator John Bollinger, however, the length of the squeeze is not necessarily pertinent to the timing or strength of future volatility.\n\n\u201cIn my experience prolonged Squeezes are rarely valuable signals.

        "content": "Glassnode data analyzed by CryptoSlate showed a divergence between super whales and retail, with the former remaining in aggressive accumulation mode going into the new year.\n\nBitcoin Accumulation Trend Score\n\nThe Accumulation Trend Score (ATS) looks at the relative size of entities that are actively accumulating or distributing their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe ATS metric uses a spectrum between 0 to 1. A reading closer to 0 indicates distribution or selling. While a score closer to 1 shows accumulation or buying.\n\nAnalysis of the chart below showed that substantial accumulation happened during the FTX collapse around early November 2022, even as the Bitcoin price reacted negatively to the news.\n\nThis suggests that investors, as a whole, saw value in buying at discounted prices.\n\nThe ATS has since turned more neutral, with distribution bias, reflecting lingering macro uncertainties going into 2023.\n\nCohort analysis\n\nCohort analysis gives a graphical representation of accumulation and distribution across six cohorts, ranging from minnows with less than one BTC to super whales holding more than 10,000 BTC.\n\nAs the FTX saga was blowing up, all cohorts were accumulating aggressively. This consistent trend ended around mid-December 2022 when whales (entities holding between 1,000 and 9,999 BTC) began heavily distributing.\n\nThe change in whale sentiment spread across other cohort groups, which also began distributing, but not to the same extent as the whales. Conversely, throughout this period to the present, super whales remained net accumulators to a strong degree.\n\nMega-Whale Address Count\n\nAnalysis of the Bitcoin Mega-Whale Address Count Balance showed entities with more than 10,000 BTC surpassed 120 addresses at the tail end of last year. This encompassed a 30-day change of over 20 additional addresses, marking the fastest growth rate since 2018.\n\nCoupled with the above charts detailing aggressive super whale accumulation, it\u2019s fair to conclude smart money investors were buying the dip.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "The Winklevoss twins are in a big mess\u2014and it has to do with crypto - Fortune",
        "content": "The Winklevii\u2014or Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, to use their given names\u2014first rose to fame in the mid-2000s when they sued Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, claiming he had stolen their idea for Facebook when they studied together at Harvard. The 6-foot-5 brothers\u2019 story was eventually detailed in the 2010 film The Social Network, including the part where Zuckerberg paid them millions to walk away.\n\nRowing fans might recognize the Winklevii from their sixth place finish in men\u2019s pairs rowing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, too, but in recent years, the brothers have been in the news for an entirely new reason: cryptocurrencies. The early Bitcoin adopters tapped into the digital asset boom of the early 2010s before launching a crypto exchange, Gemini, in 2014.\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss compete on day one of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, Aug. 9. Jonathan Ferrey\u2014Getty Images\n\nBy late 2021, Gemini was on fire and crypto prices were soaring to new record highs each day, leaving the identical twins with a combined net worth of over $7 billion. Industry analysts claimed that the party was just getting started, but after the Crypto Winter wiped out more than $2 trillion in value from the fledgling industry, the worm has turned for the Winklevii.\n\nNow, lawsuits are pending and the brothers are engaged in a very public battle with their former friend, the crypto billionaire Barry Silbert, over what will happen to the frozen funds of more than 340,000 users of Gemini\u2019s Earn platform.\n\nThe Facebook saga leads to early adoption\n\nHundreds of thousands of people worldwide have been affected by Gemini\u2019s recent issues, and none of it would have been possible without Facebook.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Cameron and Tyler had moved from their privileged upbringing in Greenwich, Conn.\u2014their father is Howard Winklevoss, former professor of actuarial science at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s legendary Wharton business school\u2014and were studying economics in the leafy confines of Harvard. Along with their classmate Divya Narendra, they came up with the idea for a social network called ConnectU to bring university students together and enlisted the help of a sophomore computer science major named Mark Zuckerberg to build out their site.\n\nThe Winklevii and Narendra alleged that Zuckerberg stole their idea to create Facebook. They sued in 2004, and after a legal battle that lasted four years, eventually settled with the Meta CEO for $65 million in mediation.\n\nThe brothers used their settlement money to invest in dozens of startups through their family office, Winklevoss Capital, and also made a timely investment in what was then a little known digital token, Bitcoin.\n\nIn April 2013, they revealed that they had invested $11 million in Bitcoin when it was trading at just $120. A year later, they launched a cryptocurrency exchange, Gemini, on the back of the investment, and everything was going according to plan until the Crypto Winter of 2022.\n\nThe birth of Gemini\n\nIn an interview with Fortune on the eve of Gemini\u2019s launch, Tyler Winklevoss described how he hoped to lean into regulation in order to make cryptocurrencies accessible to retail investors, while also attracting the institutional crowd.\n\n\u201cWall Street\u2019s not in Bitcoin yet, and part of Gemini and the licensing is to get them there,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe exchange grew quickly, barring a brief period of turbulence in the 2018 bear market, and developed a reputation as a secure U.S.-based option for crypto investors. The Winklevii became some of the first Bitcoin billionaires during Gemini\u2019s rise.\n\nBut as the pair raked in a fortune while crypto fervor grew, they also began leaning into riskier investments. Gemini started NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in 2018, but the platform quickly experienced security issues and was surpassed by the competition before being integrated into Samsung\u2019s NFT platform.\n\nIn September 2021, Cameron Winklevoss also told Fortune about one\u2014let\u2019s call it, unique\u2014investment into a startup that was attempting to revive woolly mammoths to combat climate change, saying that he saw the endeavor making money via television ads or \u201ceven parks for extinct animals, like Jurassic Park.\u201d\n\nEarlier that year, the Winklevii had launched their most important business yet, Gemini\u2019s Earn platform. The crypto lending service offered juicy returns of \u201cup to 7.4%\u201d for depositing crypto, promising that customers could redeem their funds \u201cat any time.\u201d By comparison, the average savings account in the U.S. offers just a 0.2% return today.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s investors know that a smart, diverse portfolio includes crypto\u2014it\u2019s an investment in their future selves,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss said in a press release at the launch. \u201cWe designed a program that allows our customers the ability to generate a real return on their crypto holdings without having to sell one of the best performing asset classes of the decade.\u201d\n\nAnother victim of the Crypto Winter?\n\nThe only problem for Gemini was that in order to offer high returns to investors, the company needed to make relatively (or definitely) risky bets with their customers\u2019 crypto. That\u2019s not so difficult in a bull market, but when prices begin to fall, finding a stable return can be a challenge.\n\nOne of the ways Gemini created these returns was through Genesis Global Capital, the lending arm of crypto investment firm Genesis Global Trading, which is owned by Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group. Gemini lent users\u2019 funds to Genesis, which in turn loaned them out to institutional borrowers.\n\nThe Winklevii were confident that cryptocurrency prices would continue to rise, which would enable them to offer high yields to customers consistently through this plan. In September 2021, during the height of the crypto boom, Cameron Winklevoss even told Fortune that he believed Bitcoin would end the year at $100,000 (it was less than $47,000).\n\nBut when prices for cryptocurrencies tanked in 2022, it was a whole new world for Gemini and the Winklevii, and Gemini Earn users were particularly at risk. By June, Gemini was forced to slash 10% of its workforce. And just months later, reports surfaced that the firm would need to raise at least $1 billion to stave off bankruptcy for its Gemini Earn platform.\n\nThe issue was made even worse when Genesis decided to stop issuing redemptions to clients such as Gemini after the collapse of FTX\u2014which was once the world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange. The decision meant that Gemini didn\u2019t have the money to pay returns or redeem funds on their Earn platform.\n\nIn an open letter to Silbert this week, Cameron Winklevoss said that over 340,000 users have more than $900 million in crypto trapped at Silbert\u2019s Genesis Global Capital, and in total Silbert\u2019s companies owe Gemini $1.675 billion. He argued that Silbert was engaging in \u201cbad faith stall tactics\u201d to avoid paying back customers.\n\n\u201cThe idea in your head that you can quietly hide in your ivory tower and that this will all just magically go away, or that this is someone else\u2019s problem, is pure fantasy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBarry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group Joe Buglewicz\u2014Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nSilbert responded by saying that he did not borrow $1.675 billion, and that he \u201cnever missed an interest payment.\u201d And some critics have argued that a collapse was inevitable owing to the unsustainable returns offered by Gemini. BlockFi, another crypto lender that offered high returns to investors, filed for bankruptcy in November amid the Crypto Winter and the collapse of FTX.\n\nYet Cameron Winklevoss said that he is trying to return funds to customers, but can\u2019t because of Silbert.\n\n\u201cThere you go again,\u201d he said. \u201cStop trying to pretend that you and DCG are innocent bystanders and had nothing to do with creating this mess. It\u2019s completely disingenuous.\u201d\n\nWinklevoss went on to ask if Silbert would commit to refunding $1.1 billion of what he owes by Jan. 8, but he got no response.\n\nNow, Gemini\u2019s Earn users are suing Silbert and the Winklevoss twins, alleging that Silbert breached his contract by pausing redemptions, and the Winklevii sold interest-bearing accounts without properly registering them as securities.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed a suit against the twins for misrepresenting the way their exchange and futures contracts operated back in 2017 when they sought regulatory approval.\n\nGemini\u2019s main business, its crypto exchange, is meanwhile in danger of fading into irrelevance. The exchange\u2019s spot trading volume over the past 24 hours was just $32.8 million. By comparison, the world\u2019s leading crypto exchange, Binance, had volumes of more than $8.3 billion over the same period."

        "title": "Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: A crypto beginner\u2019s guide to Nonfarm Payrolls and its effects on BTC - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nThe Nonfarm Payrolls announcement is scheduled for January 6 at 13:30 GMT.\n\nThe expectations hover around 200K as compared to the previous month\u2019s 263K.\n\nIf the NFP number comes in higher than expectations, investors can expect a short-term selloff in Bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price and the general crypto markets have been highly correlated with the stock markets since the COVID-19 crash in March 2020. Since then, macroeconomic news have been affecting Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins, and the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) monthly release is one such significant event, with the December version to be published on January 6 at 13:30 GMT.\n\nWhat are Nonfarm Payrolls?\n\nThe Nonfarm Payrolls, also known as NFP, is a measure of the number of workers that are employed during the prior month in the United States (US). The statistic is provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and excludes jobs like farm workers, government workers, private households, proprietors, and non-profit employees.\n\nWhy is NFP important?\n\nAccording to the BLS, the Nonfarm Payrolls number consists of jobs that directly or indirectly contribute roughly 80% to the United States Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Hence, the NFP provides an important assessment of the job landscape and, in turn, gives an outlook of current market conditions.\n\nAdditionally, NFP are also closely scrutinized by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve (Fed), to assess their monetary policy. The Fed does have a double mandate to keep both employment and inflation figures at healthy levels for the economy. Therefore, the measure of the jobs added or lost will set the tone for the upcoming Fed interest rate hike decision.\n\nHere are some quick examples.\n\nInstance 1: If the NFP data for December comes in higher than the prior month, it indicates that more jobs have been added. This is a positive development and will indicate a stronger economy, allowing the US Dollar to strengthen.\n\nA stronger US Dollar is usually negative for the stock market. Hence, a higher Nonfarm Payroll number that exceeds expectations usually causes the stock market to temporarily take a hit. Since the crypto markets have been highly correlated to the traditional markets in recent times, it will likely cause a similar effect on Bitcoin price.\n\nInstance 2: If NFP numbers come in lower than expectations, it may lead to a weaker US Dollar, which will inadvertently cause the stock and crypto markets (including BTC) to rally.\n\nVisualizing crypto vs. NFP\n\nTaking a look at the big picture of Nonfarm Payrolls data vs. Bitcoin price, this provides a generalized view of what has happened so far and what to expect next.\n\nThe chart attached below shows that Bitcoin price has almost always dropped when the actual NFP data has come out higher than expectations or forecasts. The only exceptions can be seen in August and December 2022, where BTC saw a short-term uptick despite the weak NFP numbers.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart vs. NFP\n\nDecember NFP report expectations and ADP\n\nOn January 6, the December Nonfarm Payrolls numbers will be announced at 13:30 GMT and the forecasts hover around 200k. To assess where the NFP numbers will land, investors can take a look at the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment numbers, which were released on Thursday.\n\nADP tracks the level of nonfarm private employment and is published usually two days before the BLS publishes the NFP numbers \u2013 although this week the data came out on Thursday due to the shortened week on New Year celebrations. Hence, market participants can use ADP to get a basic understanding of what to expect from Nonfarm Payrolls.\n\nAccording to the ADP numbers released on January 5, private employment increased by 235,000 last month as opposed to the expectations of 150,000. Since ADP numbers beat expectations, investors are expecting a similar trend for the NFP.\n\nSo, a higher-than-expected number will be better for the US Dollar, which will negatively impact the stock and cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBitcoin price could tank\n\nBitcoin price is struggling to overcome the resistance level at $16,836, which is the highest volume traded level since November 5. Interestingly, it also coincides with the midpoint of the larger range that BTC has set up, extending from $15,443 to $18,230.\n\nSince the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is already retracing from the overbought zone, the chances that bulls will make a comeback are slim. Additionally, strong NFP numbers will result in a sell-off for BTC.\n\nA breakdown of the $16,000 psychological level could likely result in a sweep of the equal lows at $15,443.\n\nBTC/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nIf the sell-off caused by the announcement of the NFP numbers is followed by a quick rise in buying pressure and a recovery rally, things could favor the bulls. If such a situation happens, the RSI should bounce off the midpoint at 50.\n\nIn such a case, Bitcoin price could bounce off the $16,624 support level and trigger another leg-up to $17,306 and even $18,401.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price may drop 12% before it reaches $1,300"

        "content": "During the winter storm in Texas in December 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) mining operators returned up to 1,500 megawatts of energy to the distressed local grid. It became possible due to the flexibility of mining operations and the ancillary services, provided by the state authorities.\n\nIn his commentary to Satoshi Action Fund, Texas Blockchain Council president Lee Bratcher stated that miners returned up to 1,500 megawatts to the Texas grid. This amount of energy would be enough to heat \u201cover 1.5 million small homes or keep 300 large hospitals fully operational,\u201d according to the calculations from the Bitcoin advocacy group.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no specification regarding the exact time period in which miners have accumulated such an amount of power, the global Bitcoin mining hash rate dropped by 30% on Dec. 24-25, 2022. Miners appeared to be the model participants of ancillary services in the state, which stimulates customers to reduce their consumption during peak demand in order to stabilize the grid.\n\nRelated: Public Bitcoin mining companies plagued with $4B of collective debt\n\nThe winter storm in North America was so severe that it shut down Binance\u2019s cloud mining products from Dec. 24-26. During the days leading up to Christmas, a \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d unleashed extreme temperatures across the United States, leaving millions without electricity and claiming dozens of lives.\n\nBack in March 2022, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) established an interim process to ensure that new large loads, such as Bitcoin miners, can be connected to the ERCOT grid. Software providers have also begun working with miners to ensure they have the tools needed to properly enable grid balancing.\n\nWith its 14% share in Bitcoin hash rate, Texas is among the top states for Bitcoin mining in the United States, along with New York (19.9%), Kentucky (18.7%) and Georgia (17.3%)."

        "content": "Welcome to Forkast Forecasts 2023. In this series, leaders, innovators and visionaries in blockchains share their industry predictions for the year ahead.\n\nDennis Jarvis\n\nDennis Jarvis is the Tokyo-based chief executive officer of Bitcoin.com, a Bitcoin exchange and cryptocurrency wallet developer. Previously, Jarvis held global leadership roles at Apple, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten and blockchain startup Orb.\n\nPredictions for 2023\n\nRegulators may tip the scale in DeFi\u2019s favor\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closer now than ever on the DeFi (decentralized finance) side with creating that [user] experience. I\u2019m optimistic that in 2023, we\u2019re going to see this experience gap between what centralized exchanges were able to offer and what decentralized exchanges are able to offer narrow even further. And this is going to be in combination with regulators who may be clamping down where they can on centralized exchanges and CeFi. Hopefully, that\u2019s going to create a tipping point in DeFi\u2019s favor. And it\u2019s up to us in the industry to make sure that we are narrowing that user experience gap, making it as easy as possible for people to explore the world of crypto and to seize control of their own financial future and prosperity and economic freedom with tools that are as easy to use as centralized finance tools were in the past, but for DeFi.\u201d\n\nThe FTX contagion will emphasize the need for DeFi\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the future looks particularly bright for centralized exchanges going into 2023. The fallout from the slew of centralized crypto businesses going insolvent recently is going to continue probably well into next year. There are probably risks of further insolvencies. It\u2019s going to take time for all the opaque dealings of centralized exchanges and businesses to unwind around the failures that happened earlier this year and also more recently with FTX. The businesses that have already declared bankruptcy are going to make their way through that process. It\u2019s going to provide more headlines in the news about how badly they mismanaged their funds. And it\u2019s not going to be great for investors and customers of these companies. But to shine a light on centralized exchanges is a necessary thing for the industry. We\u2019re going to see a lot of centralized institutions say goodbye to their businesses and the ones that remain will probably be stronger and more regulated in the future. But this is really going to emphasize the necessity of DeFi and decentralized exchanges in crypto. And I see this as more of a turn to crypto fundamentals like self-ownership and self-sovereignty over funds.\u201d\n\nThe industry will return to the fundamentals of decentralization\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a welcome reversal of the past few years where massive amounts of money have poured into crypto, but it\u2019s been in centralized custodial solutions and exchanges. The industry has moved away recently from the fundamentals of self-custody, decentralization, censorship, resistance and transparency. This is going to precipitate a shift back to those fundamentals. And this is a great opportunity for everybody in the industry who is focused on DeFi and crypto fundamentals to educate the public, especially people who have joined the space recently about how important it is to be decentralized, to be resistant to censorship and to have sovereignty of your own funds. And in fact, we\u2019re doing that with our centralized exchange education fund, where we\u2019re incentivizing users through our token program to explore the entire world of DeFi.\u201d"

Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 last November.\n\nSchiff, a well-known financial analyst and investor, has been very vocal in his criticism of Bitcoin. He believes that cryptocurrency does not have any intrinsic value, as it has yet to prove itself as a safe store of value or currency.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , the gold bug recently warned that Bitcoin was heading to zero.\n\nSchiff is concerned that Bitcoin's lack of tangible utility makes its high market valuation difficult to justify and argues this renders it vulnerable to high volatility.\n\nHis Bitcoin price predictions have been largely inaccurate. In 2018, he predicted that the currency would fall to $1,000 and urged people to sell their Bitcoins before it happened. He also predicted in 2020 that the currency would reach zero. Neither of these predictions came true.\n\nWhile Schiff's forecasts have not been accurate, it should be noted that he was right about the cryptocurrency bubble of 2021 when Bitcoin rose to an all-time high and then crashed soon after. He correctly identified this bubble before it popped, although he failed to predict its effects or exact timing accurately."

        "title": "What Is Bitcoin Gold? - OKX",
        "content": "Bitcoin Gold is an experimental fork of Bitcoin that aims to simplify and decentralize Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin Gold shares many of the same fundamental principles as Bitcoin, like a finite supply. However, the project differentiates itself from Bitcoin by implementing a unique equihash proof-of-work consensus mechanism that favors GPU mining rigs. It makes Bitcoin Gold\u2019s mining process far more accessible and straightforward for the general public than Bitcoin and is one of the features that miners love about Bitcoin Gold.\n\nThe Bitcoin Gold vision is to advance the crypto industry by providing a blockchain similar to Bitcoin that facilitates an open environment for new developers and technologies. By lowering the barriers of entry associated with Bitcoin mining, the Bitcoin Gold blockchain offers users a more accessible crypto mining experience. But what is Bitcoin Gold\u2019s token, BTG?\n\nBTG is the native token of the Bitcoin Gold blockchain. It can be used as a currency of exchange and is used to pay transaction fees and secure the network.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Gold: Key Points\n\nBitcoin Gold is an experimental network seeking to make mining more accessible\n\nBitcoin Gold\u2019s unique consensus mechanism favors GPU mining, as opposed to the highly specified ASIC mining used by Bitcoin miners\n\nGPU mining makes BTG mining possible for anyone. It helps to restore network decentralization\n\nBTG can be traded as a digital asset, used as a currency in exchange for goods and services, and is required to pay transaction fees on the Bitcoin Gold blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Gold is a hard fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Gold Work?\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of what Bitcoin Gold is, let\u2019s take a look at how Bitcoin Gold works. The Bitcoin Gold network is powered by its own equihash proof-of-work consensus mechanism. While this is very similar to the original proof-of-work model made famous by the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the equihash model has its own distinct features.\n\nBitcoin Gold\u2019s specialized equihash consensus model links block processing and throughput to the available storage memory of the computing infrastructure. This results in hash power being directly affected by the memory size of the miner. In simple terms, this completely levels the playing field and effectively means that powerful ASIC mining rigs have no competitive advantage over standard GPU processors.\n\nThis technology reinforces Bitcoin Gold\u2019s goal of \u2018making Bitcoin decentralized again.\u2019 Bitcoin Gold makes mining accessible to everyone, much like Bitcoin mining was initially intended to be before powerful miners monopolized it.\n\nBitcoin Gold also boasts certain privacy features that set the network apart from Bitcoin. Unlike most other blockchains, Bitcoin Gold aims to increase anonymity on the network by omitting transaction details when broadcasting transactions to the blockchain.\n\nBTG Pay\n\nBTG Pay is an additional program provided by the Bitcoin Gold team. BTG Pay is a complete crypto payments solution for e-commerce businesses that allows online retailers to accept payments using the Bitcoin Gold network.\n\nThe BTG Pay program allows buyers to pay for goods using crypto. BTG pay benefits from seamless integration with common eCommerce platforms like Woocommerce, Prestashop, and Magento, facilitating fast international payments at minimal transaction fees.\n\nHow Is BTG Used\n\nBTG is primarily used as a digital currency and asset. It means it can be exchanged for goods and services or held as an investment. BTG is widely supported and listed on over 75 popular cryptocurrency exchanges. As the native token of the Bitcoin Gold blockchain, BTG is used daily to process transactions and secure the network. E-commerce merchants can also use it to accept crypto payments using BTG Pay.\n\nAccording to the last Bitcoin Gold roadmap update, the team plans to make the BTG token interoperable and bring cross-chain functionality to the network. It would open BTG to a world of possibilities in the realm of decentralized finance, with the team aiming to get BTG listed on lending platforms like AAVE.\n\nBitcoin Gold History\n\nBitcoin Gold was initially founded in 2017 to create a more democratic and decentralized mining environment. The original founding team is composed of 6 integral members led by Hang Yin and Jack Liao.\n\nThe launch of the Bitcoin Gold blockchain was anything but smooth. On the day of the network\u2019s launch, the chain was victim to a coordinated DDOS attack on its cloud site. To make matters worse, early BTG miners accused the team of not communicating the network\u2019s 0.5% mining fees. It tied in with initial concerns that Bitcoin Gold\u2019s source code was not as secure as the team had claimed and was vulnerable to exploits.\n\nFortunately, these concerns were unfounded, and the Bitcoin Gold blockchain has remained secure since its launch. Bitcoin Gold has since enjoyed steady growth and stable price action and has remained in the coveted top 100 cryptocurrency list. It has been listed on over 75 exchanges across the industry.\n\nBitcoin Gold Tokenomics\n\nLike Bitcoin, the BTG token has a maximum total supply of 21 million tokens. Of this total supply, there are roughly 17 million currently circulating. It equates to approximately 80.95% of the total supply.\n\nAfter Bitcoin was initially hard forked at the genesis of the Bitcoin Gold network, the development team was permitted to mine around 8000 blocks at an increased rate to manage a founders allocation of BTG. It resulted in 0.476% of the total supply being held by the team and vested over a three year schedule. The team\u2019s token supply (as per the Bitcoin Gold Whitepaper) is to be allocated as follows:\n\nDevelopment - 30%\n\nYearly Expenses - 20%\n\nEcosystem - 15%\n\nCommunity - 15%\n\nBounties and app collaboration - 7%\n\nPre-fork costs - 5%\n\nInitial reward for a core team - 5%\n\nCommunity development - 3%\n\nHow Is BTG Mined?\n\nBitcoin Gold is mined through the network\u2019s equihash proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Like popular proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, miners compete against each other to solve complex problems to produce new blocks and earn tokens through mining rewards.\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin Gold unique is that the equihash consensus model is memory intensive instead of requiring immense volumes of computational power. The result of this feature is that ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining rigs don\u2019t have any mining advantage over GPU miners. It brings balance to the Bitcoin Gold mining environment allowing anyone with a personal computer and a dedicated graphics card effectively mine BTG.\n\nBy reviewing data provided by Messari, the Bitcoin Gold mining schedule will be completed far quicker than that of its parent project, Bitcoin. All BTG tokens are expected to be thoroughly mined and distributed by July 2027, when the total supply of BTG tokens will be fully circulating.\n\nBitcoin Gold vs. Other Forks\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about Bitcoin Gold is that while it\u2019s a hard fork of the original Bitcoin network, it\u2019s not exactly a direct competitor to the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. To better understand Bitcoin Gold's competitors, let\u2019s look at the other dominant Bitcoin forks.\n\nBitcoin Gold vs. Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that facilitates electronic payments. The basis for Bitcoin Cash was born when users realized that Bitcoin itself was rather impractical to use and didn\u2019t scale well due to its high fees and low transaction throughput. Bitcoin Cash has since enjoyed widespread adoption and is commonly used as a currency of exchange. It is one of the select few cryptocurrencies fully supported for transactions by Paypal.\n\nBitcoin Gold vs. Bitcoin SV\n\nLike Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV also aims to provide users with a fast, permissionless decentralized network that permits electronic payments. Despite what many investors think, Bitcoin SV is not a fork of Bitcoin itself but a fork of Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin SV has taken Bitcoin Cash\u2019s plan of scaling the original network and making it even faster and more affordable. While Bitcoin Cash can process around 100 transactions per second, Bitcoin SV bypasses artificial block size limits and can process up to 10,000 transactions per second.\n\nHow Is Bitcoin Gold Different From Other Bitcoin Forks?\n\nWhile Bitcoin Gold cannot boast its competitors' scalability and power, this is irrelevant because the network is focused on achieving different goals. But how does Bitcoin Gold distinguish itself from other Bitcoin forks?\n\nBitcoin Gold isn\u2019t seeking to provide an alternative payment network through scalability, it\u2019s trying to re-democratize mining rewards. While it may be smaller and less adopted than its competitors, Bitcoin Gold has different objectives. If Bitcoin Gold can deliver on its promises of interoperability and cross-chain functionality outlined in its roadmap, it will prove to be more versatile than its competitors.\n\nBitcoin Gold - Partnerships & Investors\n\nIn the spirit of full decentralization, Bitcoin Gold didn\u2019t have any private token sales or seed rounds for initial fundraising. It can be seen as a double-edged sword for the Bitcoin Gold team. The lack of institutional investors means the team has greater flexibility and creative freedom to expand the vision of the Bitcoin Gold project. However, it also means they don\u2019t have institutional support and a sizeable financial warchest that experienced investment firms often provide.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t stopped Bitcoin Gold from securing excellent strategic partnerships. In March 2020, the Bitcoin Gold team announced they\u2019d established an alliance with Latium, an international freelance network. It resulted in the BTG token being supported and accepted as a means of payment on the Latium platform. It brought further utility to the BTG token and is one of the reasons that freelancers are excited about Bitcoin Gold.\n\nBitcoin Gold - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats\n\nStrengths\n\nBitcoin Gold\u2019s greatest strength lies in its accessibility. Bitcoin Gold has grown a passionate and diverse community by lowering the entry barrier to mining BTG tokens without needing competitive mining equipment. Further, because BTG mining is not power intensive, miners are less incentivized to immediately sell their tokens to pay high setup and operational costs. It, in turn, reduces sell pressure and helps stabilize the BTG token's demand-supply mechanics.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnfortunately, the Bitcoin Gold network is not built to process a high amount of transactions rapidly and will be inhibited by scalability issues. Compared to alternative Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold cannot handle the same levels of transaction throughput and will fail to support mass adoption until this is addressed.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe features mentioned in the roadmap for further project development will likely increase the adoption of BTG. Cross-chain compatibility is essential in today\u2019s cryptocurrency industry. If the Bitcoin Gold team can successfully make the token interoperable and deploy it on other blockchains, BTG can be used in existing dApps like AAVE. It will bring better utility and adoption to BTG and distinguish it from its competitors.\n\nThreats\n\nDelayed development and infrequent updates could cripple the Bitcoin Gold project. The team has ambitious plans outlined in their roadmap, such as their goal to deploy BTG as an ERC-20 token. The Crypto industry moves incredibly quickly, and teams that fail to meet deadlines can easily get left behind. To stay relevant, the Bitcoin Gold development team needs to keep on top of its roadmap and continue to deliver on promises.\n\nBitcoin Gold Roadmap\n\nThe Bitcoin Gold roadmap underwent a significant overhaul in April 2021, with the development outlining ambitious long-term goals for the project's future. But what will this change, and what is Bitcoin Gold working on?\n\nThe development team recognizes that Bitcoin Gold needs to diversify its offering beyond being a simple Bitcoin fork. The roadmap reflects this, with a focus on four key development areas in the Bitcoin Gold ecosystem:\n\nInteroperability\n\nApplications\n\nInfrastructure\n\nL2 Lightning Network\n\nBitcoin Gold Updates, News, and Highlights\n\nIn the spirit of increasing Bitcoin Gold\u2019s interoperability and utility, the Bitcoin Gold team announced an impressive partnership that will significantly expand the potential use cases of BTG.\n\nIn March 2021, the Bitcoin Gold team announced that they\u2019d partner with Phala Network to develop cross-chain bridges with the PolkaDot ecosystem. Phala Network is a cloud-computing and privacy solution that runs on a PolkaDot parachain. It means that Phala Network is perfectly placed to liaise with the Bitcoin Gold team and facilitate the development of an affordable, trustless bridge.\n\nBTG will be the first crypto asset to be supported via this bridge, but other popular digital assets like Litecoin, Doge, and Bitcoin Cash will also be implemented. It will effectively bring over $36 billion of market value into the PolkaDot ecosystem, led by Bitcoin Gold.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Gold\u2019s Lightning Network?\n\nOne of the key flaws that hold the Bitcoin Gold network back from widespread adoption is that, compared to other Bitcoin forks, it is plagued by scalability issues. Bitcoin Gold suffers from low transaction throughput and slow processing times. So what is Bitcoin Gold doing to resolve this problem?\n\nIn response to these issues, the Bitcoin Gold team has been tinkering with deploying their own layer 2 lightning network. This layer 2 scaling solution proposes a new method to send peer-to-peer electronic transactions. In theory, lightning network transactions through direct payment channels between wallets. Blockchain smart contracts still process these payments, meaning they maintain reliability and trust. However, because payments don\u2019t need to wait for blockspace to be processed, they are instantaneous.\n\nBitcoin Gold\u2019s Lightning Network would also benefit from micro-cost transactions. Because transactions aren\u2019t reliant on being processed via the blockchain and instead pass through direct payment channels, network congestion and gas spikes are not an issue. While setting up an initial channel may incur some gas fees, users can send payments directly with micro fees once the channel is operational.\n\nWhere To Buy BTG?\n\nNow that you\u2019ve learned all there is to know about Bitcoin Gold, the next question is where to buy BTG.\n\nFortunately, OKX is the best place to buy BTG. We provide deep liquidity and high volume markets with a variety of BTG trading pairs that allow you to buy BTG instantly with minimum slippage. To buy BTG, head to the OKX Spot Market and bring up a BTG trading pair using the search function.\n\nHow To Store BTG?\n\nMany Bitcoin Gold investors like to store their BTG tokens using Bitcoin Gold\u2019s dedicated crypto wallet. Using the Bitcoin Gold Core Wallet, users are also running a validator node which helps power the chain and improve network security.\n\nYou can also store your tokens right here on OKX. Every OKX account is complete with a unique cryptocurrency wallet. Our cold wallet architecture boasts state-of-the-art security feature to protect your BTG well.\n\nAnother popular option with experienced cryptocurrency investors is storing your BTG tokens using a reputable hardware wallet. Famous hardware wallets companies like Ledger and Trezor offer top-tier security for digital assets.\n\nFAQs About Bitcoin Gold\n\nWhat Is Unique About Bitcoin Gold?\n\nBitcoin Gold is unique due to its dedicated equihash proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This consensus model aims to democratize and balance BTG mining across the network, by removing the barriers to entry usually associated with token mining. With Bitcoin Gold, anyone with a personal computer can mine BTG, and you don\u2019t need specialized mining equipment.\n\nWhere Can I Stake Bitcoin Gold?\n\nIt is currently impossible to stake BTG tokens for passive income. BTG has a fixed supply, meaning there are no inflationary staking mechanisms. The team may offer some staking utility in the future as the Bitcoin Gold network grows; however, BTG offers no staking services at this point.\n\nHow Can I Get Started Mining Bitcoin Gold?\n\nTo start mining Bitcoin Gold, you only need a computer with a suitable graphics card. After reading the mining tutorial provided by the Bitcoin Gold site, simply install the mining software onto your computer and join a mining pool to start earning mining rewards.\n\nHow Much Capital Do I Need To Start Investing in Bitcoin Gold?\n\nWith OKX, you can start investing in Bitcoin Gold for as little as $1. When trading BTG in the OKX Spot Market, you can place buy orders for a minimum of 0.01 BTG. OKX makes it easy to invest in Bitcoin Gold no matter your budget.\n\nWhat Is BTG\u2019s Maximum Supply?\n\nBecause Bitcoin Gold is a hard fork of the original Bitcoin, it features many similarities, like token supply. BTG has a maximum total supply of 21 million BTG; these tokens are slowly released over time through BTG token mining and are expected to be fully mined in July 2027."

        "title": "Tough times continue for Bitcoin miners, what does 2023 hold? - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Back in 2021, Bitcoin mining was a highly lucrative business. This is because BTC was trading well above the $30,000 mark, even reaching an all-time high of $67,000. However, things have only gone south since then.\n\nThe crypto winter, amplified by several disastrous events, has caused token prices to plummet. For instance, Bitcoin, the world\u2019s oldest cryptocurrency, is down nearly 75 percent from its all-time high. This has had an immediate impact on Bitcoin mining firms.\n\nTowards the end of December 2022, Bitcoin mining profitability had declined 70 percent and mining stocks registered 80 to 90 percent drops. As such, several of the top Bitcoin mining firms are now staring at massive losses.\n\nFor instance, on December 20, one of the largest Bitcoin mining firms, Core Scientific, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This is after the company\u2019s stock dropped 98 percent in 2022. The firm\u2019s market capitalisation is also in free fall, dropping from a $4.3 billion valuation in July 2021 to a mere $42 million at the time of writing.\n\nAnother prominent miner, Riot Blockchain, saw its stock tumble 85 percent in 2022. Recently, the firm even rebranded itself as Riot Platforms; a move to diversify its operations amid a bleak outlook for the wider Bitcoin mining industry. Core and Riot are not alone; popular miners such as Bitfarms, Iris Energy, and CleanSpark also traded 91 percent, 92 percent and 79 percent lower in 2022, respectively.\n\nFaced with these difficulties, several mining firms have been forced to turn off their mining rigs and cut down on overheads. This was evident from the Bitcoin mining difficulty, which dropped 3.59 percent on Tuesday morning. This indicates that there are fewer miners on the network.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Arctic bomb cyclone towards the end of December forced several Bitcoin mining firms in the US to temporarily shut down operations. This was done to return power to the grid so that people could continue to heat their homes amid the sub-zero temperatures. This resulted in a 40 percent drop in hash rate during the last week of December.\n\nWhat does 2023 hold?\n\nMany experts believe that firms will look to sell their mined BTC and strengthen their balance sheets. Until now, most mining companies would hold onto their mined BTC and depend on capital from the debt or equity markets to cover operational expenses. However, with the current market scenario, it is getting extremely difficult to follow this way of working.\n\nFurther, Bitcoin analysts Jaran Mellerud and Colin Harper believe that publicly traded Bitcoin miners will either go private, merge with private firms or be acquired. One good example of this is Bitcoin miner Argo, which avoided bankruptcy by allowing Galaxy Digital to acquire its Helios facility for $65 million.\n\nSome experts expect more bankruptcies in 2023, especially if the crypto markets do not improve in the coming months. \"If these market conditions persist through the middle of next year, there will likely be significant attrition in the number of miners that remain viable,\" the CEO of Marathon Digital, Fred Thiel told Blockworks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all doom, gloom and despair for Bitcoin miners. Experts believe that healthy mining companies, especially those that are prepared for the volatility and have strong balance sheets, could do well in 2023. These firms can buy up equipment from struggling/bankrupt firms at much cheaper prices. They can then expand their operations and eat into the hashrate of these bankrupt firms.\n\nFor instance, Riot is seeking out buying opportunities as other mining firms go bust. Riot\u2019s CEO Jason Les even said that firm is one of the \"best-positioned acquirers\" and is all set to expand its hashrate capacity from 5.6 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 12.5 EH/s by the Q1 of 2023.\n\nAnother firm that\u2019s looking to grow in 2023 is Marathon Digital. According to its CEO, Fred Thiel, the firm is not actively focusing on acquisitions. Rather, it is looking to build on its current capabilities and increase its hashrate from 7 EH/s to 23 EH/s by mid-2023. However, Thiel did reserve the option of acquisitions, should a good opportunity come alone. \u201cThat being said, we\u2019re keeping an eye on the market and how things develop to determine if there might be something of value to Marathon and our shareholders,\u201d Thiel told Blockworks.\n\nAdditionally, some firms may look to diversify their operations. For instance, in Nov 2022, Applied Blockchain, one of the world's biggest hosting companies, renamed itself Applied Digital. This rebranding signalled the firm's interest in other operations besides BTC mining. This is a move that Riot could also be considering, especially with its rebranding announcement yesterday.\n\nIn an earnings call before its rebranding, CEO of Applied Digital, Wes Cummins, said that the firm\u2019s hardware was being programmed for use \"relating to image processing, graphics rendering, artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"\n\nAnother prominent Bitcoin miner, Hut 8, openly announced their pivot to high-performance computing (HPC) operations to survive the never-ending winter. The firm\u2019s CEO said that the transition would include \"potentially leveraging our GPU machines to provide AI, machine learning, or VFX rendering services to customers and mining the next most profitable proof-of-work digital asset during idle time.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nThe never-ending crypto winter looks poised to continue well into 2023. This spells terrible news for the cryptoverse, which is already reeling from 2022 losses. However, the tough times are not expected to affect all miners in the same way. Experts believe that the overleveraged firms will be weeded out, and the well-prepared ones will grow, while the flexible miners will adapt to survive."

        "title": "The Surprisingly Simple Way To Steal Cryptocurrency - Hackaday",
        "content": "In the news a few days ago, the revelation that Luke Dashjr, a core Bitcoin developer, had his wallet compromised, and lost 200 BTC. A small fortune, and something of a shock. I\u2019m guessing that someone with that expertise would not have left his private key lying around, so as a cryptocurrency non-enthusiast I\u2019m left curious as to how the attackers might have done it. So I phoned a few friends who do walk those paths for an explanation, and the result was a fascinating conversation or two. The most probable answer is still that someone broke into his computer and copied the keys \u2014 straight-up computer theft. But there\u2019s another possible avenue that doesn\u2019t involve stealing anything, and is surprisingly simple.\n\nAre You A Gambler, Or An Engineer?\n\nI\u2019m guessing that most Hackaday readers will know something about how a blockchain works, and also how public-key cryptography works. Public-key cryptography is key to the security of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, with the key that unlocks all your wealth for you being your private key and the key which allows transactions to be made with you by other people being your public key.\n\nIf you want to send some cryptocurrency to someone else, you encrypt the transaction using their public key which is as its name suggests, public, and your private key which is known only to you. Thus it\u2019s important that your private key is kept really private, because if someone finds it they control your stash of cryptocurrency. So to steal all those bitcoins someone had his private key, an eventuality that should never have happened. We can safely assume that his protection of the key was as good as it gets, so further assuming that nobody physically stole his hardware wallet or whatever he kept it on, his key was compromised by other means.\n\nThe true security of public-key cryptography lies in it being extremely difficult to guess an individual\u2019s private key. A brute-force algorithm to guess Luke Dashjr\u2019s private key would require unimaginable computing power over a geological-level timespan, thus it\u2019s also safe to assume that nobody set their computer to guessing his key alone. At this point, it\u2019s helpful to stop thinking like an engineer, and start thinking like a gambler. An engineer calculates the time required to brute force Luke Dashjr\u2019s private key, but a gambler throws the dice and sees if the throw generates any money.\n\nThinking from a gambler\u2019s perspective, what are the dice, and how likely is a throw to win? If you roll the dice by guessing a private key at random and try it against Luke Dashjr\u2019s stash of Bitcoin alone, then you\u2019re in the same area as the engineer waiting geological time for your computer to crack it. But if you\u2019re a gambler, you don\u2019t care about Luke Dashjr or anyone else, you\u2019re simply interested in the keys to any wallet with some Bitcoin in it. At this point the odds against you come down enormously, because instead of one chance with Luke Dashjr, you have a whole blockchain\u2019s worth of possibilities for a match.\n\nHow To Steal 200 BTC By Brute Force\n\nSo here\u2019s how it works. The blockchain contains the public keys of all its participants, everyone who has, or has had, Bitcoin. You collect that list, which is quite large, and hold onto it. Then you roll the dice, by generating a random private key. From that private key you generate the corresponding public key, and check whether it\u2019s in the list of public keys on the blockchain. If it matches, you empty the wallet connected with it; if not, you repeat the process by generating another key. By not focusing on a particular individual account, you\u2019ve reduced the time you\u2019ll have to wait to crack any account from a geological aeon to a much more manageable figure. My friends suggested that it might be possible to find something in the order of months if they had enough resources.\n\nAs the title says then, it\u2019s a surprisingly simple way to steal cryptocurrency. But simple doesn\u2019t mean that the attack makes economic sense. Guessing key pairs requires significant resources and time, and you have to weigh this against the chances of finding a whale with boatloads of Bitcoin versus the chance of finding an account with a couple bucks left in it, which would sting after having invested millions into computer time. Doing this seriously is a gamble, and thankfully for the integrity of Bitcoin, probably a bad bet. But who knows? People do play the lottery.\n\nIf you want to roll the bones yourself, there is even a handy proof of concept in the form of keys.lol, the product of Sjors Ottjes, a Dutch web developer. This site displays a range of keys and queries the Bticoin and Ethereum blockchains to see if they match anything. You\u2019ll soon see the scale of the task as you load random pages, and it\u2019s safe to say that the chances of loading a page with a valid key on it are very small indeed.\n\nIf you hold Bitcoin, you should at least think about the brute force attack. But it doesn\u2019t concern us \u2014 our wealth is held in unobtainable semiconductor devices stashed in a safety deposit box.\n\nHeader image: Ralf Roletschek, CC BY-SA 3.0."

        "content": "The PnL and NUPL metrics position suggested a possible further decline for Bitcoin in 2023.\n\nInvestors taking long positions on BTC were currently dominant.\n\nSeveral forecasts have been made about \u2018when the bear market would end,\u2019 and in most cases, this coincided with a rally in Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] price. A glance at several important measures can help point one in the correct way when trying to make sense of the rumors and theories surrounding the king coin and its future move.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nPnL Index suggests bottom is not in\n\nWhen discussing the behavior of prices, the term \u201cbottom\u201d refers to the point at which prices have dropped to their lowest before beginning to move upwards again.\n\nThere have been a lot of rumors and guesses about where the bottom of Bitcoin will be, and a recent post from CryptoQuant stated that king coin\u2019s bottom is yet to be reached.\n\nAccording to the chart of the Profit and Loss Index (PnL), Bitcoin began the year in the undervalued zone; nevertheless, it could not cross above its 365-moving average. The placement of the metrics suggested that the price of Bitcoin may continue to decline even more.\n\nPositive NUPL but capitulation in play\n\nNet Unrealized Profit or Loss (NUPL) is another significant indicator that might be used to access Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) genuine condition. It is calculated by dividing the difference between the respective unrealized gains and losses.\n\nA negative value indicates a losing market, whereas a positive one indicates a profitable one. Whether the market is profitable can be determined by looking at the NUPL on-chain indicator.\n\nExamining Glassnode\u2019s NUPL metric revealed that the currency was below zero, signaling a loss in holdings.\n\nLong-position investors stay dominant\n\nEven though the PnL and NUPL charts presented what appeared to be a gloomy view, investors continue to be optimistic about a price increase for BTC.\n\nThe Funding rate chart on CryptoQuant indicated that the measure was positive. Given the position of the metrics, it was clear that investors were banking on a sustained increase in the price of Bitcoin over the long run by establishing a long position.\n\nAre your holdings flashing green? Check the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nWhen it comes to BTC, it would appear from a glance at the PnL and NUPL measures that the market is yet to reach its bottom. As of this writing, the price of the coin was hovering at about $16,000; it could not stage a recovery that would allow it to return to the region around $20,000, where it had been in prior months before its decline.\n\nNevertheless, investors appear to be optimistic about a price rise in the future, which is always the case once the bottoms have been established in a market."

        "content": "How the Holiday Season Could Impact Bitcoin Prices\n\nCryptocurrencies, the most prominent of which is Bitcoin, have been gaining popularity in recent years and are becoming more widely accepted by merchants worldwide. As the holiday season approaches, it is important to consider how this could potentially impact the prices of Bitcoin. So let\u2019s.\n\nAre there any seasonal patterns in Bitcoin price movements around holidays?\n\nIndeed, there are seasonal patterns in Bitcoin price movements around holidays. Generally speaking, the current bitcoin price tends to increase during holiday periods due to increased demand from investors and traders. This is especially true for major holidays such as Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day when people have more time off work and can dedicate more time to trading.\n\nSome countries may also experience a surge in demand for Bitcoin during their own national holidays, such as Chinese New Year or India\u2019s Diwali festival. During these times, the prices of Bitcoin tend to rise due to increased demand from local investors and traders.\n\nAnalyzing historical Bitcoin price movements during the holidays\n\nTo analyze historical Bitcoin price movements during holidays, it is important to look at the data from different angles. For the initial step, you should consider the overall trend of Bitcoin prices during holiday periods. This will give you an idea of how prices tend to move around these times and whether there are any patterns that emerge.\n\nAfter that, you should look at specific events that may have occurred during holiday periods and how they impacted the price of Bitcoin. And always consider macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and inflation when analyzing historical Bitcoin price movements during holidays.\n\nAre there any differences in the effects of national and religious holidays on Bitcoin prices?\n\nYes, of course, there are differences in the effects of national and religious holidays on Bitcoin prices. National holidays tend to have a more significant impact on Bitcoin prices than religious holidays. National holidays often involve large-scale events such as government announcements or economic data releases that can affect the market sentiment and thus influence Bitcoin prices.\n\nOn the other hand, religious holidays usually do not have any major economic implications and therefore their effect on Bitcoin prices tends to be less pronounced. Some countries may observe different religious holidays more than others, which could lead to varying levels of impact on Bitcoin prices depending on where they are being traded.\n\nIn conclusion, the holiday season could have a significant impact on bitcoin prices, as more people are likely to invest in cryptocurrency during this time of year."

        "content": "Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) published its unaudited bitcoin production and miner installation updates for December 2022 today.\n\nThe company mined 1,563 bitcoin in Q4. Also, it increased its hash rate without sacrificing its progress in terms of transitioning to more sustainable power sources. Now the company operates with a hash rate of 7.0 exahashes per second year over year, and the majority of it comes from the King Mountain wind farm in West Texas.\n\n\u201cAs we enter 2023, we remain confident in our ability to scale Marathon into one of the largest and most energy efficient Bitcoin mining operations globally. We have thousands of miners ready to be energized over the coming months, which we expect to more than triple our current production capacity to approximately 23 exahashes by mid-year,\u201d said Fred Thiel, Marathon\u2019s chairman and CEO.\n\nThe company expanded its agreement with Applied Digital in December to use roughly 12,000 S19 XPs at their Jamestown facility in North Dakota. The S19XPs are a more energy efficient type of bitcoin miner. The site is already built and working and the expectation is that miners will come online within the next month. Miner installations are underway at Garden City, and the company presently has 2.1 exahash prepared.\n\nRead more: Galaxy Digital Holdings inks agreement with Argo Blockchain for Texas mining facility\n\nRead more: Infinite Reality and Newbury Street Acquisition combination forms metaverse centred media company\n\nMarathon improves liquidity while engaging cooling tech\n\nMarathon also started taking proactive measures to improve its liquidity situation and enhance fleet performance. It paid its outstanding balances under its revolving credit agreement, which freed up 4,200 bitcoin it had been using as collateral. This boosted its total unrestricted BTC holdings to 7,815 BTC (or approximately USD$129.3 million) as of December 31. Additionally, the company turned the new year over with a $103.7 million cash position.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings also produced 475 bitcoin in December 2022 with 1,562 BTC topping out Q4. The Bitcoin mining stats for the fiscal year top out with 4,144 BTC, which is 30 per cent more than the 3,197 BTC produced in 2021. This brings Marathon\u2019s total bitcoin holdings to 12,232 BTC as of December, 2022.\n\n\u201cDuring December, we tested overclocking and underclocking servers and began researching dual-phase immersion cooling systems. We also continued working with the new operator of the King Mountain site on improving operations and the curtailment strategy to optimize production,\u201d said Thiel.\n\nThese changes will help Marathon develop significant advantages over its competition.\n\nThe company initiated a pilot project using immersion-cooling to keep its ASIC rigs cool and reduce costs. It involves sinking Bitcoin mining servers into a dielectric fluid to reduce the amount of heat the ASIC rigs generate, and potentially improve operational efficiency.\n\nThe team successfully bumped the hash rate of an S19 J Pro ASIC rig by 20 per cent while reducing the amount of power used per terahash by approximately 4 per cent. Additionally, the company boosted its hash rate of an S19 XP by 20 per cent by increasing the number of joules per terahash from 21.5 to 23.7 joules per terahash.\n\nFollow Mugglehead on Twitter\n\nLike Mugglehead on Facebook\n\nFollow Joseph Morton on Twitter\n\njoseph@mugglehead.com"

Here are 5 things you can try\n\nLastPass is taking a lot of criticism from multiple quarters after it announced that hackers, who attacked the platform in August, have a copy of consumer data, including names, email addresses, billing addresses and telephone numbers.

        "title": "Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin in transaction volume for the year 2022 - Nairametrics",
        "content": "The total transactions on the Ethereum network tore through that of Bitcoin by more than fourfold in 2022, data from DollarGeek has shown.\n\nData from Nasdaq and Ycharts have also shown that there were 338% more Ether transactions in 2022 (408.5 million) than Bitcoin transactions (93.1 million).\n\nThis notwithstanding, Bitcoin managed to retain its crown when it comes to online search interest, according to google trend searches. About 28.41 million people googled Bitcoin during the year.\n\nMore details on this: The Ethereum blockchain averaged a daily transaction count of around 1.1 million for ETH, while that of Bitcoin\u2019s network stood at 255,000 for BTC.\n\nAlthough the Ethereum network led the charge, transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were steadier and more periodic than on the Ethereum network, which experienced much more volatility in transaction volumes.\n\nThis was due to spikes in demand at certain times such as NFT launches and other gas fee-intensive events such as XEN minting.\n\nMore on Ether\u2019s performance: Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, has seen its supply drop since October 8., 2022 which marked the Ethereum network\u2019s first deflationary move.\n\nThe deflationary move happened when the network switched from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) via the Merge in September 2022.\n\nAfter the update, a portion of the Ethereum network gas fee, otherwise known as the transaction fee, is permanently removed from the Ether circulation. Simply put, more ETH gets burned in a high-demand environment.\n\nWe began to see the Ethereum network\u2019s deflationary functionality after October 8, when a new crypto project named XEN Crypto increased network traffic. At the time, XEN Crypto accounted for the burning of 4,490 ETH tokens against 16,690.52 ETH tokens on the day, which represents 26.90% of the total transactions burned.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s unending relevance: It is believed that people\u2019s interest in Bitcoin remains relatively high as experts assess quality compared to other crypto assets in the industry.\n\nCNBC reported that Venture capital investor, Tim Draper, explained that weaker coins will become relics amid the ongoing crypto winter, benefitting BTC. According to him, this is an indicator that the top cryptocurrency could reach $250,000 per token.\n\nEthereum\u2019s heftier transaction volumes have continued into the new year, with the Ethereum transaction count on Jan. 2 reaching 924,614, a 300% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 229,191 on the same day, according to Bitinfocharts.\n\nThe analyst who posted the metrics explained that he was sceptical about people saying that a \u201cflippening,\u201d could happen someday, and further added that those advocating for it have reason to do so now.\n\nA flippening occurs when one chain surpasses a higher-ranked one for the same metric, in this case, transactions and activity.\n\nWhile there is a clear distance between Ethereum and Bitcoin\u2019s transaction volumes, the distance could be more significant than we are reading. This is because the charts do not include layer 2 transactions, which would put Ethereum even further ahead of Bitcoin for this metric.\n\nAccording to L2beat, the number of L2 transactions per second actually surpassed those on layer 1 Ethereum in mid-October and has remained above it ever since."

        "content": "After ending 2022 in a sideways trading pattern, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has kicked off the new year with short-term gains, although the value still languishes below key support levels. Bitcoin is also attempting to build momentum towards new levels while seeking inspiration from elements such as macroeconomic news.\n\nIndeed, by press time on January 6, Bitcoin was valued at $16,758, with gains of about 6.6% over the last week. The weekly chart shows that Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 peak stood at $16,721 on January 4.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nDespite the gains, Bitcoin investors are looking for a possible bottom to usher in a new rally for the maiden cryptocurrency. Currently, the $17,000 level remains a key resistance position for BTC.\n\nImpact of macroeconomic news on BTC\u2019s price\n\nBased on the recent price movement, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe in a tweet on January 6, stated that Bitcoin is at support while identifying key long positions to look out for, especially with key macroeconomic data coming out.\n\n\u201cIt [Bitcoin] needs to hold above $16.6K to avoid a puke to low $16K and to sustain upward momentum. In that regard, with the data today, I\u2019d be looking at bit lower for longs towards $17K,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin\u2019s possible rally toward $17,000 can partly find a boost after the United States recorded an unemployment rate of 3.5% in December from the 3.7% witnessed in November 2022. Furthermore, the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December, higher than the estimated 200,000.\n\nWith Bitcoin being impacted by the Federal Reserve monetary policies, the jobs data will be crucial since it forms part of the institution\u2019s interest rate hike decision.\n\nFurthermore, crypto investors will be looking at the release of ISM. Notably, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) is responsible for measuring the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index or PMI for both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors across the U.S.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin\u2019s one-day technical analysis retrieved from TradingView is dominated by bearishness. A summary of the daily gauges recommends the \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 11 while oscillators are \u2018neutral\u2019 at 8. The moving averages gauge is for \u2018sell\u2019 at 10.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite Bitcoin showing signs of recovery, the machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions indicates that the asset might be in line for a bearish outlook in the first month of 2023. In this line, the forecast suggests that Bitcoin will trade at $15,532 on January 31.\n\nIn the meantime, investors will be hoping the asset builds on 2022 milestones. For instance, despite the market downturn, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain witnessed a transaction of over $8 trillion in 2022.\n\nAt the same time, crypto sector players anticipate a mixed 2023 for Bitcoin, with a section expecting further effects from incidents such as FTX collapse, while others project the 2024 halving event as a significant catalyst for the flagship crypto.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
