        "title": "Happy Birthday, Bitcoin: Top Cryptocurrency Turns 14 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Bitcoin fans celebrated the top cryptocurrency's 14th year on Jan. 3 with swarms of birthday posts on social media, signaling the digital asset's resilience even after a prolonged slump in value.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways The genesis block of Bitcoin (BTC) was mined on Jan. 3, 2009; that date in 2023 marked its 14th birthday.\n\nThe asset and its blockchain technology have had a profound impact on the world and survived multiple challenges.\n\nAdoption of Bitcoin continues to increase, with more companies and countries buying in to the asset.\n\nThe crypto community has celebrated the occasion, predicting many more years of growth for Bitcoin.\n\nA Humble Start\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the famed and mysterious Bitcoin creator, mined the first block of Bitcoin on Jan. 3, 2009.Nakamoto received 50 BTC as a reward for the genesis block\u2014a holding that would be a massive sum by today\u2019s standards for the token's value.\n\nHis reward can't be spent because Satoshi didn't send the transaction from the genesis block to the global transaction database. It is unclear whether this was intentional.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's Price History. Investopedia / Hugo Lin\n\nSurviving Many Challenges\n\nPredictably, a novel asset such as Bitcoin would, at some point, encounter resistance and obstacles. And it did, on several occasions, especially during its early years. Bitcoin\u2019s price tumbled in some particularly notable incidents\u2014but its highs continue to outshine the lows. The theme of the cryptocurrency\u2019s ability to recover strongly after bear markets began to cement themselves during those early years.\n\nThe very first Bitcoin transaction took place in October 2009 when a Finnish computer science student named Martti Malmi sold 5,050 BTC, giving each coin a valuation of $0.0009.\n\nOne of the most notable early real-world transactions occurred in 2010 when the now-famous Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. At today\u2019s value, that would work out to about $167.3 million. The purchase has become a crypto community event is marked on May 22 as Bitcoin Pizza Day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Bitcoin reached a $1 valuation, which happened in February 2011. Shortly afterward, the asset's price climbed to $10 and then to $30, leading to a leap of 30 times for that year. In 2013, it crossed $1,000 per token.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin\u2019s $1,000 mark pales compared with its more recent valuation levels. The all-time high of just under $69,000 was reached in 2021. While it may be much lower than that now, many investors are optimistic, especially given the continued broadening of adoption.\n\n\n\nA Rapid Explosion in Adoption and Awareness\n\nOne of the reasons there is growing optimism about Bitcoin is the fact that adoption and awareness don't seem to be stagnating, even as the asset's price does. From the launch of the world\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM in 2013 to the fact that the Bitcoin symbol was encoded in Unicode, an international encoding standard that assigned unique symbols for use in different languages across various platforms and programs, the cryptocurrency has found a place in the public consciousness.\n\nThen came the initially slow, but now rapid, parade of companies investing in or accepting Bitcoin for payment. That list includes Tesla, Block, and MicroStrategy, to name a few. These companies have played a big part in boosting awareness of Bitcoin and persuading those on the fence about Bitcoin to try it.\n\nBitcoin also has made advances on a governmental level. El Salvador famously made Bitcoin legal tender, and it continues to bet on the asset. More recently, the Central African Republic also named Bitcoin as legal tender, much to the surprise of some of the world\u2019s authorities.\n\nTwitter Community Celebrates\n\nThe crypto community on Twitter always erupts into celebration when Bitcoin's birthday arrives, from the average retail investor to the most prominent names holding the asset.\n\nFor example, this Jan. 3, \"Bitcoin maximalist\" and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy (MSTR) Michael Saylor called Bitcoin ''Digital Gold'' on Twitter. Bitcoin \"Maxis\" believe that Bitcoin is the only digital asset that will be needed in the future. Prominent \"Ethereum Maxi\" Evan Luthra tweeted about how Bitcoin's birth permanently changed the world.\n\nAlso on Bitcoin's latest birthday, one of Ukraine's largest pharmacy chains, ANC, announced that it now will accept Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nOf course, recently, the price of BTC hasn\u2019t been much to celebrate. Bitcoin trudged through the 2022 holiday season below $17,000. However, it started the new year on a slightly more optimistic note, which investors will hope could be the start of a bull run.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin's short life has been eventful. The cryptocurrency is likely to encounter many more years of growth, and steadily expanding adoption will do much to encourage that. Bitcoin\u2019s 14th birthday is just another milestone in what could play out as a long life for the groundbreaking financial asset.\n\n"

        "title": "The boldest bitcoin calls for 2023 are out \u2014 and a 1,400% rally or a 70% plunge may be on the cards - CNBC",
        "content": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year. STR | Nurphoto via Getty Images\n\n2022 was a rough year for crypto. More than $1.3 trillion was wiped off the value of the market. And bitcoin, the world's largest digital coin, saw its price slump more than 60%. Investors were caught off guard by a wave of collapses in the industry from stablecoin project terraUSD to crypto exchange FTX, as well as a worsening macroeconomic climate. Those who made predictions about bitcoin's price in the past year really missed the mark. But with 2023 now here, some market players have stuck their neck out with price calls for what could be another volatile year. Interest rates around the world are on the rise, and that's weighing on risk assets like stocks and bitcoin. Investors are also watching how the FTX saga, which resulted in the arrest of the company's founder Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas, will develop. CNBC rounds up some of the boldest price calls for bitcoin in 2023.\n\nTim Draper: $250,000\n\nBitcoin bull Tim Draper had one of the most optimistic calls on bitcoin of 2022, predicting the token would be worth $250,000 by the end of the year. In November, the billionaire venture capitalist said he's extending the timeline for that prediction until mid-2023. Even after the collapse of FTX, he's convinced the coin will hit the quarter-of-a-million milestone. \"My assumption is that since women control 80% of retail spending, and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women that the dam is about to break,\" Draper told CNBC via email. Bitcoin would need to rally 1,400% in order for it to trade at that level. Despite the depressed prices and trading volumes drying up, there could be reason to suspect the market has found a bottom, according to Draper. \"I suspect that the halvening in 2024 will have a positive run,\" he said.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe halvening, or halving, is an event that happens every four years in which bitcoin rewards to miners are cut in half. This is viewed by some investors as positive for bitcoin's price, as it squeezes supply. The next halving is slated to happen sometime in 2024. Bitcoin miners, who use power-intensive machines to verify transactions and mint new tokens, are being squeezed by the slump in prices and rising energy costs. These actors accumulate massive piles of digital currency, making them some of the biggest sellers in the market. With miners offloading their holdings to pay off debts, that should remove most of the remaining selling pressure on bitcoin.\n\nThat's historically a good sign for bitcoin, said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development at crypto exchange Luno. \"In prior down markets, miner capitulation has usually indicated major bottoms,\" Ayyar told CNBC. \"Their cost to produce becomes greater than the value of bitcoin, hence you have a number of miners either switching off their machines \u2026 or they need to sell more bitcoin to keep their business afloat.\" \"If the market reaches a point where it's absorbing this miner sell pressure sufficiently, one can assume that we're seeing a bottoming period.\"\n\nStandard Chartered: $5,000\n\nFor some market participants, the worst is yet to come. In a Dec. 5 research note, Standard Chartered said bitcoin may sink as low as $5,000. The prediction, one of the bank's list of \"surprises\" that are being \"under-priced\" by markets, would represent a 70% plunge from current prices. \"Yields plunge along with technology shares\" in Standard Chartered's nightmare 2023 scenario, \"and while the Bitcoin sell-off decelerates, the damage has been done,\" said Eric Robertsen, the bank's global head of research. \"More and more crypto firms and exchanges find themselves with insufficient liquidity, leading to further bankruptcies and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets,\" he added. Robertsen said the scenario has a \"non-zero probability of occurring in the year ahead\" and falls \"materially outside of the market consensus or our own baseline views.\"\n\nMark Mobius: $10,000\n\nVeteran investor Mark Mobius had a relatively successful 2022 in terms of his price call. In May, he forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nHe said bitcoin would fall to $10,000 in 2022. That did not happen. However, Mobius told CNBC that he is sticking for his $10,000 price call in 2023. The investor, who made his name at Franklin Templeton Investments, told CNBC that his bear case for bitcoin stemmed from rising interest rates and general tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve. \"With higher interest rates, the attraction of holding or buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies becomes less attractive since just holding the coin does not pay interest,\" Mobius said via email.\n\nCarol Alexander: $50,000\n\nCarol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, wasn't far off the mark with her prediction that bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022. Now, she thinks the cryptocurrency could be set for gains \u2014 but not for reasons you might expect. The catalyst would be more dominos from the FTX fallout tipping over, Alexander said. If this happens, she expects the price of bitcoin will top $30,000 in the first quarter, and then $50,000 by quarters three or four. \"There will be a managed bull market in 2023, not a bubble \u2014 so we won't see the price overshooting as before,\" she told CNBC. \"We'll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes.\" Alexander's reasoning is that, with trading volumes evaporating with traders on edge, large holders known as \"whales\" will likely step in to prop up the market. The wealthiest 97 bitcoin wallet addresses account for 14.15% of the total supply, according to fintech firm River Financial.\n\nwatch now\n\nSome investors have given up trying to predict the price of bitcoin. For Antoni Trenchev, CEO of crypto lending platform Nexo, the recent events are a sobering moment. Bitcoin was on a \"positive path\" earlier in 2022, with institutional adoption rising, but \"a few major forces interfered,\" he said. Trenchev once predicted bitcoin surging to a peak of $100,000 by early 2023. Now, he's done trying to predict the price. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, suggested attempts to forecast bitcoin's price are futile. \"We could be sitting here talking this time next year and it could be at $5,000 or 50,000 it just wouldn't surprise me because the market is so heavily driven by sentiment,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\""

        "title": "How much did I lose on my 2022 bitcoin investment? It's complicated - ZDNet",
        "content": "Getty Images\n\nThis was supposed to be an easy article to write. In January of 2022, I spent a few bucks investing in bitcoin. My plan back then was to wait a year, and then write an article (this one, in fact) showing how much I gained (or lost) over the course of the year. It was to be stunt writing at its best.\n\nSpecial Feature The Tech Trends to Watch in 2023 Learn about the leading tech trends the world will lean into over the next 12 months and how they will affect your life and your job. Read now\n\nBut that's not how its turning out. Oh, sure. I lost a huge percentage of my investment. But I can't just throw bitcoin (or even cryptocurrency in general) under the bus and claim that crypto is a bad investment. That's because a wide range of investments (especially tech) plummeted in 2022.\n\nWe're way beyond the scope of a \"correction,\" where the market adjusts for an unexpected bout of exuberance. But we're not at the legendary (but not necessarily true) tulip craze either, where investors get their comeuppance for believing in some bonkersly stupid investment idea.\n\nNo, we're at the beginning of 2023 and much of the market has tanked. This isn't a tulip or crypto or craze sort of story. Instead, it's a story about the vagaries of investment and how you need to be careful where you put your hard-earned money.\n\nMy bitcoin journey\n\nOn January 1, 2022, I bought $50 worth of bitcoin through PayPal. That was an interesting process all on its own. It cost me a buck fifteen in fees to make the purchase, so all-in, I spent $51.15 to embark upon this grand experiment.\n\nSee also:\n\nWithin minutes, I lost 25 cents. After one night, my losses amounted to a whole 32 cents. But, of course, that was just the beginning.\n\nI next checked in seven days later and my investment had dropped again. This time, I was down a total of $7.08, for a 13.84% drop. I checked again at the end of January, and my holdings had dropped again. In three weeks, my losses doubled. I was down $14.38, for a total drop of 28.11%.\n\nThen, I waited. I gave it a full six months. Exactly six months into my bitcoin investment, I checked into my vast holdings. As of July 1, my $50 was worth $20.30. My portfolio had lost 60.31% of its value.\n\nNow, we're at a full year. I haven't looked at the value of my bitcoin since July. Let's check it together. I'm about to login to PayPal and take a look.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nWell, that's interesting. My bitcoin investment lost 60.31% percent of its value in the first six months of my holding it. But it lost only another 5.63% in the second six months. My bitcoin investment is now worth only a paltry $17.42.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nConsidering how volatile it was during the first six months (and especially the first month of 2022), it's been remarkably stable these last six months.\n\nThe rest of the story\n\nNow is the time when I expected to mock bitcoin. After all, losing 60.31% of your investment in six months is a terrible loss. I expected to discuss how it would be better to invest in something that wasn't totally fake, yada, yada, yada.\n\nBut life isn't that simple.\n\nOkay, look. I'm about to start discussing stock values and investments, so a massive disclaimer is in order. I am not a stocks or investment expert. I'm not telling you any of this to give you investment advice. I'm just reporting on behavior based on publicly available data. So, before you go betting your money on anything I talk about, think again.\n\nFrankly, beyond the fifty bucks I gambled away on bitcoin, I have no other investments. I'm not big on gambling. Since I don't have confidence in my ability to spot a sure thing, I've avoided investing in stocks and crypto altogether. End disclaimer.\n\nLet's get back to the whole crypto investment theme. To do that, we need to take a pause and look at the news of the day.\n\nWhen the markets closed for the final time in 2022 on Friday, investors were shaken by how much of a beating they'd taken overall. CNBC reported, \"Stocks fall to end Wall Street's worst year since 2008.\"\n\nIf you look at the major indexes (the Dow, S&P, and NASDAQ), all were down for 2022. These are aggregated indexes of companies across industries and, as such, reflect business performance overall.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nBut these are index stocks, which means their value is representative of the movement of all their members. If some members do great, but most do poorly, then the entire index will trend down.\n\nThe biggest tech stocks did particularly badly in 2022. Apple lost 26% of its value, Amazon lost almost half, and Meta (Facebook) dropped almost 65%. IBM, on the other hand, did particularly well.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nStocks across other industries had more varied performance. Retailers like Home Depot and Walmart lost value, but health providers and oil companies continued to grow in value. This list is far from comprehensive, but it helps showcase that parts of the economy did rather well, even as investment performance in tech -- particularly the top tier big names -- didn't do as well.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nSo, the top-line conclusion is simple. Investing is something of a gamble. You could gain a lot. For example, if you'd invested $1,000 in Exxon Mobile at the beginning of the year, you'd have $1,802 today.\n\nBut if you'd invested that same $1,000 in Tesla last January (and yes, we all know the whole Twitter/Musk story is part of this), you'd have only $349 left.\n\nBut you can't blame all of tech stock's loss on Musk. A thousand dollars invested in Facebook a year ago would have been worth only $357 today.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis is why investing seems like gambling to me. Last January, I considered my bitcoin investment to be an experiment for the benefit of ZDNET readers. I thought there was a (very) slim chance I might make a few bucks, but I was pretty convinced I'd lose a few instead.\n\nBut had you asked me whether my bitcoin investment was more chancy than, say, an investment in Tesla, I would have told you \"sure.\" After all, bitcoin is all magic rainbows and unicorns. It's imaginary currency and nothing is real. On the other hand, Tesla makes fine cars and has factories and technology and such.\n\nThe idea that a thousand dollar investment in Tesla stock on January 1, 2022 would have the same value on January 1, 2023 (within pennies) of a thousand dollars invested in Bitcoin would have seemed ludicrous.\n\nAlso: Elon Musk's Tesla has sold 75% of its Bitcoin: Here's why\n\nAs I said, you can't blame it all on Elon Musk, no matter how much he seems like a comic book villain. A thousand bucks invested in Facebook last January is worth just a few bucks more than a thousand dollars invested in bitcoin, and Musk had nothing directly to do with that collapse.\n\nTiming matters, of course. Back in the day, I actually started my first company using the profits I made from an Apple stock investment. But had I made that investment in Apple in 2022, I wouldn't have had any profits to use to start much of anything.\n\nInvestment is about (hopefully) buying low and selling high. It's not about buying according to a calendar entry. So no sane investor would buy on January 1, 2022 and plan on selling on January 1, 2023. Instead, a good investor would expect to hold onto an investment until it's time to sell. That concept became such an issue of controversy among crypto enthusiasts, though, that a misspelling of the word \"hold\" launched a mocking meme for traditional investment strategy, HODL (hold on for dear life), in response.\n\nSo, what does it all mean?\n\nI started this experiment at the beginning of 2022 expecting to show you that cryptocurrency was a much less reliable investment than more traditional investment vehicles. I'm ending 2022 showing you that it's all a crap shoot.\n\nMy experiment was, essentially, a data gathering expedition that didn't come home with reliable results. I can't tell you to avoid crypto. I can't tell you to invest in crypto. I can't tell you to avoid stocks. I can't tell you to invest in stocks.\n\nWhat I can tell you is this: if you have no idea, don't risk your money. Unless you know a lot more about stocks and investment and crypto than I apparently do, hang onto your cash or invest it in whatever is considered safe these days. That's probably something like mutual funds, but at this point, I wouldn't feel comfortable making any kind of recommendation.\n\nDo your research. Ask around. Listen to your gut. And definitely don't invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nThat said, I have a good overall feeling about 2023. Have a great year, folks!\n\nHow are you feeling about cryptocurrency investments after 2022? What are your plans for 2023? Let us know in the comments below. And hey, if you had a great New Year's weekend, let us know about that, too.\n\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

        "title": "The Genesis Block: The First Bitcoin Block - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The Genesis Block was simply the first block of bitcoin (BTC) to be mined. You might see it called Block 0 or Block 1.\n\nIt\u2019s still there today and will remain there as long as any computer runs the Bitcoin software. Every node in the Bitcoin network can go and look at it, even though it now sits at the other end of a chain hundreds of thousands of blocks long. That\u2019s the point of the blockchain.\n\nA block is a collection of transactions that get validated all together. The transactions in a block get added at once to the chain, which is the complete history of legitimate transactions using bitcoin. Every blockchain has a genesis block, just as every regular chain has a final link. People care especially about the first Bitcoin block because Bitcoin was the first blockchain and remains the largest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nThe number of transactions in a Bitcoin block is variable, but these days it\u2019s generally between 1,000 and 2,500. On the other hand, the time blocks take to get validated or \u201cmined\u201d is consistently around 10 minutes. This schedule is built into the software: If blocks are mined too quickly, the validation hurdle contrived to keep the network secure and ensure the mining process is competitive automatically gets harder, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the Genesis Block contains the first set of bitcoin transactions to be validated. In fact, there was only one transaction, which was the distribution of the 50 BTC reward for mining the block to a certain address. Miners are still rewarded today, though the reward has since declined to 6.25 BTC. In the case of the Genesis Block, there was only one person who knew about bitcoin to mine it: the original cryptocurrency\u2019s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSatoshi (almost certainly a pseudonym) mined the Genesis Block on Jan. 3, 2009. That was three months after he or she published the Bitcoin white paper in an online cryptography forum. People now call Jan. 3 \u201cGenesis Block Day.\u201d\n\nThe first Bitcoin block\n\nSatoshi made the Genesis Block special in a number of ways. For one thing, the 50 BTC reward was sent to an address from which it can never be recovered. On a technical level, the 50 BTC transaction wasn't recorded as such in the same way as later transactions. That\u2019s why any attempt to spend those coins would fail. Satoshi never commented on the reasons for that.\n\nIn a still more mysterious move, Satoshi wrote a message within the standard lines of data attached to the block. It was a headline from British newspaper The Times:\n\nThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\n\nAgain, Satoshi never explained this. But others have read heavily into the choice. One of Satoshi\u2019s aims in creating Bitcoin might have been to save people from having to hand money over to a bank as an alternative to stashing cash under their mattress. In 2009, the great recession was in full swing. Some people had gone to their bank only to find their money was gone. Other people found their pensions had gone the same way. Many think it is no coincidence that Satoshi chose that particular headline to write into the Genesis Block. This was supposed to be the beginning of the end of people relying on banks so much that the government had to rescue them from their own mistakes using taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nWhether Satoshi\u2019s comment was targeted mainly at banks or governments or both remains a topic of debate among Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nAnother theory is a little more mundane. The inclusion of a headline from that day proved that the code wasn't written before that day. Satoshi might just have wanted to dispel any suggestion he had mined the block in advance to give himself some advantage as its creator.\n\nSatoshi might have had all these things in mind. Barring a spectacular unmasking, we will never know for sure.\n\nIt is also peculiar that the second Bitcoin block was mined on Jan. 9, a whole six days after the first one. Remember, Bitcoin blocks are supposed to take 10 minutes to mine. There could be lots of reasons for the outlier block time. The algorithm that adjusts the difficulty of mining to maintain the 10 minutes only kicks in every two weeks or so. But the fun theory is that Satoshi was consciously echoing the six days that God takes to create the world in the Book of Genesis.\n\nHow are Bitcoin blocks different today?\n\nBitcoin blocks have changed a lot since 2009. They contain thousands of transactions, instead of one. They take 10 minutes to mine. Miners are rewarded with 6.25 BTC, after three \u201chalvings\u201d of the reward, which occur roughly every four years on a predetermined schedule. As of December 2022, there were more than 750,000 blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain. They form an unbroken sequence, each specifically referencing the previous one, stretching all the way back to the Genesis Block.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin core developer claims to have lost 200+ BTC in hack - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "One of the original core developers behind Bitcoin (BTC), Luke Dashjr, claims to have lost \u201cbasically\u201d all his BTC as a result of a hack that occurred just before the new year.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 post on Twitter, the developer said the alleged hackers had somehow gained access to his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key, a common security method that uses two keys to gain access to encrypted information.\n\nIn the thread, he shared a wallet address where some of the stolen BTC had been sent but did not reveal how much of his BTC was stolen in total.\n\nPSA: My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help please. #Bitcoin \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) January 1, 2023\n\nAt the time of writing the wallet address in question shows four transactions between 2:08 and 2:16 pm UTC on Dec. 31, totalling 216.93 BTC \u2014 worth $3.6 million at current prices.\n\nDashjr said he had \u201cno idea how\u201d the attackers gained access to his key, though some in the community have pointed to a possible connection with an earlier Twitter post from Dashjr on Nov. 17 that noted that his server had been compromised by \u201cnew malware/backdoors on the system.\u201d\n\nPSA: My server was accessed this morning by an unknown person. Full analysis in progress, but take extra care that you PGP-verified any downloads. #Bitcoin \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) November 17, 2022\n\nDashjr told a user in his most recent Twitter thread that he had only noticed the recent hack after getting emails from Coinbase and Kraken about login attempts.\n\nThe incident has also caught the attention of Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, who offered condolences and support in a Jan. 1 post.\n\n\u201cSorry to see you lose so much. Informed our security team to monitor. If it comes our way, we will freeze it. If there is anything else we can help with, please let us know. We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide,\" he wrote.\n\nSome in the crypto community have speculated that lax security might be to blame for the loss.\n\nIn a Jan. 1 Reddit thread, a user calling themselves SatStandard suggested that Dashjr may not have taken the Nov. 17 security breach \u201cseriously enough\u201d and later suggested that the Bitcoin developer \u201cdid not keep different activities separated.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had hot wallet on the same computer he did everything else. It looks like he was really complacent.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a few others appear to suggest it may not have been a hack at all, suggesting that someone had stumbled across the seed phrase somehow, or it was part of an unfortunate \u201cboating accident\u201d ahead of tax season.\n\nA boating accident in this context is in reference to a running joke and meme originally used by gun enthusiasts, but since repurposed by the crypto community about people trying to avoid paying taxes by claiming they lost all their BTC in a \u201ctragic boating accident.\u201d\n\nTop tier boating accident. \u2014 Nate (@beeforbacon1) January 1, 2023\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Dashjr over Twitter for more information about the alleged hack but did not hear back by the time of publication.\n\nRelated: The 10 largest crypto hacks and exploits in 2022 saw $2.1B stolen\n\nThe news has also ignited a debate around self-custody, which became a hot topic after the collapse of FTX last year.\n\nBinance\u2019s Zhao, who previously cautioned the crypto community about self-custody, said: \u201cSad to see even an OG #Bitcoin Core Developer lost 200+ BTC ($3.5 million). Self custody [has] a different set of risks.\u201d\n\nOnline social media BTC influencer Udi Wertheimer also took the time to question whether self-custody was a viable and safe option, commenting that one \u201cshouldn\u2019t manage your own keys.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf even one of Bitcoin\u2019s OG developers messes this up, I really don\u2019t know how other people are expected to do it safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say self custody is bad. But you shouldn\u2019t manage keys directly,\u201d he said."

        "title": "What will Bitcoin become when it\u2019s all grown up? - Forkast News",
        "content": "This week, Bitcoin is celebrating its 14th birthday. As the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world eases into teenhood, it faces a future that, while seemingly tainted with uncertainty, is also brimming with endless possibilities.\n\nAfter all, it was the genesis of Bitcoin in 2009 that birthed the emerging technology of blockchain and marked the start of the decentralization revolution across the globe. With blockchain and cryptocurrency having cemented their place in the mainstream, and Bitcoin even likened to gold due to its utility as a store of value \u2014 its potential for growth is evident to all.\n\nBut much like every coming-of-age story, what lessons might the industry learn from its tumultuous journey thus far, and what can we look forward to in a new world that is discovering meaning and sense?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s birth: a story of hope\n\nAmid what was arguably one of the most devastating financial crises in history, public distrust of central governments and financial institutions grew to an all-time high following the colossal collapse of Wall Street behemoth Lehman Brothers in 2008 \u2014 but from the ashes rose Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of a person or group of individuals who brought forth Bitcoin, a trustless model for electronic cash transactions.\n\nNakamoto\u2019s white paper painted a rosy and hopeful picture of the future at a time when loss and distrust were rampant in the financial world. At the heart of it all, Bitcoin was created to solve long-standing issues that had plagued the financial system by offering anonymity and transparency in peer-to-peer payments \u2014 effectively eradicating the need to go through intermediary parties like banks that we had deemed to be \u201ctrustworthy\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d prior to the Wall Street fallout.\n\nIndeed, interest was piqued with Bitcoin\u2019s first financial use case \u2014 when hungry programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas from fast food chain Papa John\u2019s. But when more use cases beyond commercial transactions emerged, the world sat up and listened. Bitcoin did not just promise a better future \u2014 it delivered \u2014 when crypto began to solve wider socioeconomic issues across the globe.\n\nConsider the oft-quoted example of people in the Philippines pivoting to crypto game Axie Infinity as a source of income when the Covid-19 pandemic hit \u2014 despite teething problems such as the numerous controversies surrounding the game, its sheer ability to lift communities out of poverty is undeniably encouraging. Or look no further than the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Day Organization\u2019s efforts to empower women \u2014 who also form the majority of the world\u2019s unbanked population \u2014 financial inclusion could in fact become a reality for historically marginalized communities. It is apparent that crypto is blossoming into a legitimate asset class with the potential to radically reset the financial landscape.\n\nA teenager with growing pains\n\nAlas, adolescence is never an easy phase. Much like the mood swings and identity crises that any teenager experiences, Bitcoin has experienced wild market swings and has even had its very existence called into question. Beyond price volatility, many have cited its enormous energy consumption \u2014 at 91.4 Twh, the network can power all of Finland for an entire year \u2014 as the single biggest issue the legacy network has to solve. On the other hand, others have argued that its consensus mechanism allows for the realization of Nakamoto\u2019s vision for a decentralized, democratic financial ecosystem.\n\nAt the same time, even more challenges abound for the wider crypto space. Whether it\u2019s due to greed, hubris, or pure misfortune, what we had believed to be \u201cindustry heavyweights\u201d like Three Arrows Capital and FTX have single-handedly destroyed investor confidence and faith in crypto with their respective Lehman moments \u2014 ironically reminiscent of the financial crisis the asset class emerged from.\n\nWith bad actors threatening to spell the end for Bitcoin and the crypto industry, where do we go from here?\n\nThe path to maturity: boundaries beget safety and stability\n\nAs the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to develop and mature, but we need to rally together as a community to support the growth of the nascent industry on all fronts. We need constant innovation, we need visionaries in the space, but most of all, we need boundaries.\n\nWhen parameters are established by regulators and policymakers, innovators can develop and experiment with emerging technologies in a stable, sustainable manner and within safe confines. Without clear regulatory frameworks, innovation will only introduce risks to the ecosystem and eventually suffocate its own growth. Thankfully, we are making some headway to counter this possibility across Asia. Most recently, Hong Kong announced the framework of a new regulatory regime for digital assets to combat money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and Japan continues to adjust its crypto laws to suit dynamic market demands.\n\nDespite the loss of trust in the aftermath of the recent crypto crash, continued institutional buy-in also serves as a reminder that it was centralized entities that first failed \u2014 not crypto\u2019s underlying technology.\n\nAt the end of the day, the lessons we have learned from Bitcoin\u2019s short 14-year history will go on to shape the future of digital finance. For the long-term viability of crypto, it would be vital for measures that embed accountability, regulatory discipline and general responsibility to come into play, lest we forget Bitcoin\u2019s provenance and its altruistic promise to recreate the financial world to be one that is democratic, safe and inclusive."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's biggest and most popular cryptocurrency is celebrating its 14th birthday today. On January 3, 2009, the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis block, was mined by the pseudonymous developer(s) known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Cryptocurrencies are by-products of the blockchain technology.\n\n\"Despite challenges, Bitcoin has continued to thrive and has become an alternative to the centralised financial world. As Bitcoin turns 14 years old, it is worth reflecting on the incredible journey that it has been on thus far and the many innovations that it has inspired. Here's to hoping that the next 14 years are just as exciting for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency world,\" said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX.\n\nCryptocurrencies had a harsh 2022 after reaching record highs late last year, buffeted by everything from the Fed\u2019s policy tightening to the implosions of the Terra/Luna ecosystem, hedge funds Three Arrows Capital and exchange FTX.\n\n\u201cBitcoin turns 14 years old today. Being the front runner in this fast-maturing asset class, Bitcoin had a roller coaster ride. From being exchanged for a couple of pizzas to giving people ambitious hopes of buying Lamborghinis with their holdings to more rational adoptions, such as investment products by financial institutions, Bitcoin has come a long way. We are witnessing a modern financial revolution led by Bitcoin. With nations drafting legal frameworks around the usage of cryptocurrencies, the coming times are going to be milestone moments for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency ecosystem,\" said CEO and Co-founder, Edul Patel, Mudrex.\n\nBitcoin, which is currently trading over $16,500 level, is down by three-quarters from its record high of $69,000 that it had hit in November 2021.\n\n\u201cWe will see a lot of regulations in 2023 and the years to come and the markets will mature and become stable. All these moves will penetrate Bitcoin more and more in the global economies. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin will prove it to be the most trusted on the in the future as compared to other crypto currencies which are very much centralized,\" said Amanjot Malhotra, Country Head - India, Bitay.\n\n\u201cLooking at the historical growth of Bitcoin, we find that it has thrived victoriously through multiple bull and bear market cycles. According to data from Glassnodes, close to 60% of circulating Bitcoin hasn't moved in a year. This shows that the trust in the asset remains rock solid. We are confident that Bitcoin will continue to emerge victorious and see greater heights in future,\" said Raj Karkara, COO, ZebPay.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "Why Bitcoiners don't want to be lumped in with other cryptocurrency enthusiasts - Texas Standard",
        "content": "The downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX cryptocurrency exchange has brought a lot of focus to the inner workings of the crypto marketplace, even among folks who hadn\u2019t previously paid much attention to this world.\n\nThe FTX crash also exposed rifts among crypto enthusiasts, some of whom say that Bitcoin \u2013 the cryptocurrency that started it all \u2013 should not be viewed in the same light as FTX, or linked to what they believe to be less stable currencies.\n\nSlate associate writer Nitish Pahwa wrote about the divide between Bitcoin and other parts of the crypto world. He told Texas Standard that Bitcoin \u201cmaxis\u201d or maximalists, believe other cryptocurrencies are too closely connected to the traditional finance system Bitcoin was instituted to avoid. Listen to the story above or read the transcript below.\n\nThis transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:\n\nTexas Standard: What did you see as the significance of the FTC\u2019s failure for the crypto industry overall? I mean, if you had to put your finger on what the significance was, what would you say?\n\nNitish Pahwa: I think there are several planes of significance, but to really harp on the biggest ones, I think one \u2013 it was just a huge shock to a lot of people over the past couple of years who finally got interested in cryptocurrency because Sam Bankman-Fried, the man at the center of it all, had presented himself as this very ethical, very smart, very savvy operator who was doing a lot of fundraising through cryptocurrency for the greater good of the world. And then it turns out he may have been just doing a lot of the same fraud as anybody in the traditional financial system. We obviously don\u2019t know yet. The criminal charges and civil charges are ongoing, but it is definitely plausible.\n\nAnd as for other parts of the crypto world, especially the Bitcoiners, the ones who have been sticking firm to Bitcoin from the very beginning \u2013 they view this as a vindication of their principles, because they never wanted to see their technology or the very concept of their Blockchain-based digital currencies reach a level that it had with Sam Bankman-Fried. They wanted it to be its own thing. So when they see this particular flame out, they\u2019re looking at this like, \u201cokay, this is why we were right all along.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, the term \u201cBitcoin\u201d sometimes gets used sort of generically like \u201ccrypto,\u201d but \u201cBitcoin\u201d actually refers to a specific currency that started in 2008. What, then, was happening with FTX and can Bitcoin be sort of walled off from FTX\u2019s failure?\n\nYeah, Bitcoin really kicks off 2008-2009 after the financial crisis. It\u2019s envisioned as a peer-to-peer currency with a certain amount of coins in existence, a certain amount of blocks from which to mine those coins, and done in a way where a lot of people are cut in at all times running their own systems for mining and working together in Bitcoin trades. Now crypto, on the other hand, has become this umbrella term for everything else that Bitcoin has basically led to or inspired. And so that means any other big digital currencies that are not named \u201cBitcoin,\u201d or any of these big exchanges or companies like FTX that are now very much enmeshed within the traditional financial system. They\u2019re publicly traded on the stock market and they\u2019re gaining typical venture capital investment and such.\n\nBut Bitcoiners always want to stay outside the traditional financial system \u2013 or as they call it, \u201cTradFi\u201d \u2013 because they viewed TradFi as being responsible for disasters like the financial crisis or myriad other economic crises before them. So they don\u2019t want Bitcoin to get caught up in the way that it has through exchanges like FTX. But then of course it is businesses like FTX through their aggressive publicity marketing, partnering with celebrities like Tom Brady and so on, that ended up getting more attention to this world.\n\nWell, now, of course, Bitcoin has not emerged from this unscathed, even though I hear what you\u2019re saying and I understand what the community is doing when they\u2019re drawing the distinctions. But Bitcoin was already way down in 2022. What sort of headwinds do they face now with confidence among the population at large sort of being hammered and shattered?\n\nSo you\u2019re absolutely correct that Bitcoin has been affected a lot by economic travails from the hike in interest rates, general stock market crashes, tech layoffs, you name it. A lot of people do trade or store Bitcoin on these exchanges, which, to really generalize and oversimplify it a bit, do kind of operate like banks. You store some currency in there. It\u2019s supposed to be backed by collateral. They\u2019re doing some other lending. And in return for your investment, you\u2019re supposed to get a pretty decent yield percentage. Now, for all this, there are a lot of people who held Bitcoin and did not want to just stick to the traditional system. They wanted to try to see what they could do with Bitcoin on all these other exchanges. And so when these exchanges have been hit, Bitcoin\u2019s value falls as well. And right now, Bitcoin is definitely not doing well.\n\nThat being said, a lot of \u2018maxis\u2019 \u2013 the term for Bitcoin maximalists \u2013 will tell you that this is not as bad a crash that they\u2019ve seen before. There\u2019ve been plenty of Bitcoin crashes over the years and their mantras are always, \u201chold on for dear life, buy the dip because eventually it\u2019ll still pan out.\u201d I do not foresee the currency regaining a ton of its value anytime soon, but I also don\u2019t see it totally going away because its hardest adherents are going to keep their faith in it.\n\nWell, I also wonder how much FTX has turned the spotlight on Bitcoin and the possibility of government regulation.\n\nOh, absolutely. There is going to be some regulation for sure. The White House is weighing in, Congress is weighing in from both sides of the aisle. There definitely has to be something that comes out of this, because with Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s downfall, now, there\u2019s a lot of scrutiny on lawmakers who got donations from him. And they\u2019re going to be very eager to prove that they were not just like stooges on his behalf. And this could be anything with regard to fraud control or just designating whether like a certain digital currency is a commodity or a security or some other sort of financial instrument. But I\u2019m like 99% positive that there will be some sort of government action on cryptocurrency in the new year.\n\nIs Bitcoin now liberated to move forward independent of FTX or not so much?\n\nOh, that\u2019s a great question. Yeah. I think there\u2019s definitely going to be a chill and I think a lot of the Bitcoin maximalists are going to take the opportunity to really push for their way of things. How convincing that is going to be, I have no way of knowing. That being said, I do think crypto\u2019s and Bitcoin\u2019s reputation as a whole is definitely shattered, at least for a little bit, and we\u2019ll see what it actually takes for them to recover in any conceivable way."

        "title": "Key bitcoin developer calls on FBI to recover $3.6M in digital coin - Ars Technica",
        "content": "One of the prominent developers behind the bitcoin blockchain said he has asked the FBI to assist him in recovering $3.6 million worth of the digital coin that was stolen from his storage wallets on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nLuke Dashjr is a developer of the Bitcoin Core, an app that runs 97 percent of the nodes making up the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Core derives from the software developed by the anonymous bitcoin inventor who uses the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. That software was called simply Bitcoin but was later changed to Bitcoin Core to distinguish it from the coin. Dashjr has been contributing to the Bitcoin Core since 2011 and has long championed the concept of decentralization that the cryptocurrency was founded on.\n\n\u201cWhat the heck, FBI?\u201d\n\nOn New Year's Day, Dashjr took to Twitter to report that his entire bitcoin holdings\u2014worth roughly $3.6 million\u2014were \u201cbasically all gone.\u201d He said the hack stemmed from the compromise of a PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key that he used to ensure that his downloads of Bitcoin Core and a smaller app known as Bitcoin Knots weren\u2019t laced with malware. He said all his computers were compromised and urged people to hold off downloading new versions for the time being.\n\n\u201cSo to be clear: DO NOT DOWNLOAD BITCOIN KNOTS AND TRUST IT UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you already did in the last few months, consider shutting that system down for now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDashjr didn\u2019t respond to an interview request.\n\nIn the same thread, the developer said he had contacted the FBI and police but hadn\u2019t received a response.\n\n\u201cWhat the heck @FBI @ic3. Why can't I reach anyone???\u201d he wrote. \u201cI paid those taxes and the police don't care. What a scam.\u201d\n\nDashjr said the wallets compromised were both hot\u2014meaning accessible over the Internet\u2014and what he believed were cold\u2014meaning they were hosted on a device not connected to the Internet. He didn\u2019t elaborate, but it appears he was theorizing that one or more computers he used was infected and that the hackers could then obtain the funds stored on them. It\u2019s hard to make sense of that, however, since a wallet stored on an Internet-connected device is, by definition, hot.\n\nThat problem aside, the theory might be consistent with a breach Dashjr reported in November. During that incident, the developer said, the hackers \u201cbypassed my software-side security measures by rebooting the server off an unknown storage device. For about 5 minutes it was running some other system.\u201d The hackers then installed two or three remote-shell backdoors.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot that doesn\u2019t add up to the events Dashjr has reported. Without more details, it\u2019s hard to come to any firm conclusions. One takeaway, however, is clear, as evidenced by one of the most influential bitcoin developers calling on law enforcement to recover his stolen digital coin: The notion that cryptocurrencies provide a decentralized platform that cuts out established authorities is nothing short of a pipe dream."

        "title": "Tax attorney breaks down the MicroStrategy Bitcoin sale - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy made headlines ahead of New Year\u2019s Eve as the sale of a portion of its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings drew the attention of industry experts and critics.\n\nA regulatory filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 28 detailed the first time the firm sold some of its BTC since its high-profile adoption of the preeminent cryptocurrency as its primary treasury asset.\n\nMicroStrategy made waves in the industry in 2021 as it began amassing significant holdings of BTC, with founder Michael Saylor touting the asset as a superior store of value to fiat currency as a primary reason for the move.\n\nGiven Saylor\u2019s role as a staunch Bitcoin proponent over the past two years, MicroStrategy\u2019s decision to sell some of its BTC drew attention across the industry. However, the company\u2019s SEC filing outlines clear intent to generate a tax benefit.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s subsidiary MacroStrategy bought 2,395 BTC for approximately $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21 at an average price of $17,871 per BTC. It then sold 704 Bitcoins on Dec. 22 at an average price of $16,776 per Bitcoin for $11.8 million, highlighting its intent to reduce its tax bill:\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph reached out to international tax attorney and CPA Selva Ozelli to unpack MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin sale and the reasoning behind it. As she explains, selling cryptocurrencies for a profit in America would require the payment of capital gains tax:\n\n\u201cSome investors choose to reduce their capital gains in a given tax year by selling some of their digital assets at a loss. This is called tax-loss harvesting.\u201d\n\nOzelli said that the practice is common for individuals in the cryptocurrency space, given that assets like BTC are treated as property by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and subject to capital gains and losses rules:\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the wash sale rule, which prohibits selling securities at a loss and reacquiring them within 30 days does not apply. Because crypto is not a security, there is no crypto-specific wash sale rule.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy made use of this exception, reacquiring 810 BTC for approximately $13.6 million in cash just two days after realizing a loss on the sale of a portion of its holdings.\n\nOzelli highlighted the volatility of cryptocurrency market prices as an opportunity for retail and institutional investors to realize and harvest capital losses. The challenge lies in identifying assets that present the greatest opportunity for tax savings:\n\n\u201cThe difficult part for investors is identifying which of the digital assets in their portfolio have the highest cost basis (original purchase price) when compared to the current market price.\u201d\n\nNonfungible tokens (NFTs) also present another avenue to reduce tax liabilities. Renowned DJ Steve Aoki has been selling a variety of NFTs on OpenSea, with his activity publicly viewable on his verified profile.\n\nReports speculate that Aoki may have been looking to carry out tax-loss harvesting. Cointelegraph has reached out to the DJ\u2019s publicist to ascertain the reason for the sale of hundreds of NFTs from his extensive collection."

        "title": "Models and fundamentals: Where will Bitcoin price go in 2023? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) had a bumpy ride throughout 2022, along with the rest of the digital asset market. The cryptocurrency began the year exchanging hands around $46,700 and is currently trading over 64% down at $16,560 at the time of writing. Consequently, the coin\u2019s market capitalization took a tumble from around $900 billion on Jan. 1, 2022 to end the year at around $320 billion.\n\nBitcoin Price Trend in 2022\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s drop in price could be attributed to the extraordinary circumstances that the entire cryptocurrency market has been through this year, it is important to reevaluate the 2022 price predictions made by various market entities. One of the most popular predictions was that of analyst PlanB\u2019s Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model.\n\nThe S2F model predicted BTC to be at nearly $110,000 as of December 2022. The cryptocurrency finished the year trading at almost 85% off target, which raises questions about the validity of the price model. Stock-to-flow models are generally used to price commodities in the traditional markets, as they account for two variables related to an asset: stock and flow. \u201cStock\u201d refers to the total existing supply of the asset, and \u201cflow\u201d refers to the new supply of the asset created each year.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo \u2014 a digital asset management platform \u2014 shared with Cointelegraph his thoughts on the validity of the S2F prediction model:\n\n\u201cThere are many factors that can influence the price of Bitcoin, including market demand, regulatory changes and technological developments. The S2F model is one tool that can be used to make projections about the future price of Bitcoin, but it is important to keep in mind that it is based on certain assumptions and is not a definitive guide to the future.\u201d\n\nBesides S2F, other models have been used to attempt to predict the price of Bitcoin in the near and distant future. Two popular ones are Elliott Wave Theory and Hyperwave Theory. While both also find their roots in traditional financial markets, their success in predicting the price of BTC has been relatively limited as well.\n\nPrice models fail as a new year for Bitcoin ushers in\n\nConsidering that Bitcoin only began its journey as an asset just over a decade ago, it is safe to say that the cryptocurrency is still in its nascent stages of price discovery when compared with commodities like gold or silver and other leading technology stocks like Apple and Microsoft. Thus, while there are various BTC price predictions, it is essential to remember the limited availability of cyclical data to factor into these models.\n\nTrenchev added that there are many different models and approaches that can be used to try to predict the price of Bitcoin. Some people use technical analysis, which involves studying historical price and volume data to identify patterns and trends. Others use fundamental analysis, which involves evaluating the underlying factors that can affect an asset\u2019s demand and supply. No single model or approach is universally considered to be the most reliable for predicting the price of Bitcoin, and it is crucial to consider a range of factors when making any investment decisions.\n\nRelated: The Three Most Controversial Bitcoin Price Models and What They Predict\n\nAlex McCurry, CEO and co-founder of blockchain solution provider Solidity.io, agrees with Trenchev, telling Cointelegraph, \u201cBitcoin is a completely unpredictable asset. The only thing one can be certain of when it comes to Bitcoin is the underlying fundamental value of the Bitcoin network and the value it presents to holders and investors. Because of this, one can predict long-term adoption and value in the macroeconomic climate over time, but perfectly timing an exact price is impossible.\u201d\n\nHowever, one important aspect could change the trends for the price of Bitcoin: utility.\n\nSince Bitcoin is not a smart contract-compatible network, the asset\u2019s utility has been limited to a payment rail. That is slowly beginning to change, with Bitcoin now finding more utility than ever before, supported by the Lightning Network.\n\nLN is a layer-2 payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network that enables fast, seamless peer-to-peer transactions. It helps improve the scalability of the network enormously. Most recently, Michael Saylor\u2019s MicroStrategy announced that it plans to release Lightning Network-powered software and solutions in 2023.\n\nClick \u201cCollect\u201d below the illustration at the top of the page or follow this link.\n\nMicroStrategy also continues adding Bitcoin to its treasury. Between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21, 2022, the company acquired 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,181 for a total of $42.8 million. For tax reasons, it sold 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin for a total of $11.8 million on Dec. 22. As a repurchase, the company bought 810 BTC on Dec. 24 for $13.6 million in cash. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries, this puts the firm\u2019s holdings at 132,500 BTC, worth around $2.2 billion at the time of writing.\n\nGlobal investment manager VanEck released 11 crypto predictions for 2023, among which it claimed that BTC will drop to $10,000\u2013$12,000 in Q1 \u201camid a wave of miner bankruptcies\u201d and will bounce back up to $30,000 in the second half of 2023.\n\nMcCurry agreed with this prediction, stating, \u201cI believe Bitcoin will bounce back in 2023, and I feel that by 2024, Bitcoin will achieve a new all-time high significantly higher than the 2021 peak of $69,000.\u201d\n\nTrenchev added, \u201cIt is possible that the price of Bitcoin could rebound to $30,000 in the second half of 2023, but it is also important to keep in mind that the price of Bitcoin is highly volatile and can be affected by a wide range of factors.\u201d\n\nDerivatives market and BTC price discovery\n\nDespite the unpredictable, volatile nature of Bitcoin\u2019s price, the asset\u2019s derivatives market is an important indicator of its current and future sentiment.\n\nAccording to data from Coinglass, the Bitcoin futures market currently has an open interest (OI) of over $9 billion. At the same time, the open interest of the Bitcoin options market stands at $3.4 billion, with over 76% of the OI on cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Deribit.\n\nLuuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of Deribit, spoke with Cointelegraph about what options data for 2023 reveals about the market\u2019s price sentiment for Bitcoin. He said:\n\n\u201cThe overall put-call ratio for June 2023 is 0.24, which is rather low. This typically implies bullish sentiment, as there are three times more calls outstanding than puts. Max pain is at $19,000, also showing upside potential. Investors are positioning at the larger strikes ($20,000, $25,000 and $30,000). The premium for the higher strikes is much lower, obviously, so these could be seen as an upside bet, or used for yield generation by call sellers.\u201d\n\nThe max-pain price is the price point at which the largest number of options are in loss. Strijers also added that \u201csince the FTX implosion, investors seem to be on the sidelines, waiting for news about the industry, but also macroeconomic news. We have experienced new lows in the implied volatilities, and the short term is currently trading in the low 30s. We\u2019re even having dailies seen trading below 30%. At the same time, liquidity is currently lower than normal.\u201d\n\nMarket uncertainty aside, incoming regulations in 2023 \u2014 namely, the European Union\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets bill and the United States\u2019 Lummis-Gillibrand and Warren-Marshall bills \u2014 could bring stability to the market, as investors who feel the space is provided with more oversight will likely feel more confident.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Mesmerized by rising prices, industry rushed hand over fist to purchase Bitcoin application-specific integrated circuits miners on easy credit.\n\nHowever, in today's context of Bitcoin price collapse, skyrocketing electricity prices, lower market prices for mining rigs, and record-level mining difficulty, 2022 became an extremely difficult year for sector players. That said, some are holding on better than others.\n\nTop 10 publicly-traded Bitcoin miners by liabilities | Source: Hashrate Index\n\nOn Jan 3, Bitfarms announced that the company sold 1,755 BTC during Dec. 2022 for total proceeds of $29.9 million. The firm then used this amount to pay down $16.5 million in its BTC-backed facility, along with $2.0 million in equipment-related indebtedness.\n\nBitfarms also managed to renegotiate miner purchasing agreements leading to extinguishing $45.4 million without penalty while establishing a $22.4 million credit for pre-paid pre-paid deposits to be applied against future purchase agreements. The company mined 5,167 BTC ($86.1 million at the time of publication) for all of 2022 and had an outstanding debt balance of $47.0 million at the year's end.\n\nThe same day, Stronghold Digital Mining announced that it reached an exchange agreement to convert $17.9 million of its debt into preferred stock bearing a face value of $23.1 million. The preferred stock would bear no interest nor dividends, and would, in turn, be convertible into common stock (with negligible par value) at a conversion price of $0.40 per share, which is near the stock's market value of $0.44 at the time of publication.\n\nOthers were not as fortunate. Cointelegraph previously reported on Dec 21 that Greenidge signed a $74 million debt restructuring agreement with creditor NYDIG. The deal, if executed, would provide credit relief at the cost of restructuring the company from an independent Bitcoin miner into a hosting site for NYDIG's Bitcoin mining rigs. Similarly, Core Scientific, one of the largest players in the sector, managed to secure a $37.4 million loan but nevertheless is undergoing bankruptcy.\n\nNot all Bitcoin miners embarked on credit-fueled expansion strategies. On Jan 3., Digihost announced that it increased BTC production by 60% year over year. The company said it has no debt other than a vendor-take-back mortgage on its Alabama facility in the amount of $934,500. Cointelegraph also previously reported on Dec 21 that German Bitcoin miner Northern Data said the company had no financial debt while expecting $204 million in revenue for 2022."

He was at a loss to explain how his cold wallets were compromised, but he said the last time he\u2019d accessed them was in September.\n\nLooks like some of it is coinjoined to 1YAR6opJCfDjBNdn5bV8b5Mcu84tv92fa \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) January 1, 2023\n\nDashjr posted a followup tweet calling out ColoCrossing for allegedly \u201cdropping the ball on abuse investigation last time\u201d and he vowed to replace his server provider. Some responders also flagged up a security breach he tweeted about back in November as possibly being connected to the hack.\n\nDashjr continued to answer questions on Twitter, saying that he believes \u201ceverything is compromised,\u201d even potentially his Twitter. He also strongly cautioned people against using Bitcoin Knots, a Bitcoin wallet signed by his own now-compromised PGP key. Dashjr also tweeted at the FBI for help, to no avail.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao offered his support, saying that he had informed the exchange's security team of the theft, and that if any crypto linked to the hack was sent to Binance, \"we will freeze it.\"\n\nSelf custody and security\n\nZhao immediately wrote a follow-up tweet linking to Dashjr\u2019s thread as an example of the risks of holding cryptocurrency in self-custody wallets.\n\nStory continues\n\nSad to see even an OG #Bitcoin Core Developer lost 200+ BTC ($3.5 million).

The latter two have seen heightened interest from consumers throughout the industry\u2019s ongoing insolvency crisis, also known as \u201cCrypto Winter.\u201d\n\nHow to Move Bitcoin, Ethereum and Other Crypto to Self-Custody\n\nAs contagion from the historic collapses of Terra and FTX spread in a year where record numbers of cybertheft were reported, people increasingly looked towards getting their balances off of accounts controlled by centralized entities, like exchanges and lenders, and onto self-custody solutions.\n\nAfter billions of dollars worth of crypto were withdrawn from Binance in a single day, Changpeng Zhao took to a Twitter Spaces talk to warn that \u201c99% of people\u201d will lose crypto that they hold using self-custody solutions."

        "content": "2022 was a terrible year for cryptocurrencies, with the loss of $2 trillion in market value.\n\nWe could now see the handover of crypto technology and blockchain infrastructure to more regulated and established institutions.\n\nCryptography and blockchains will continue to be integral parts of the modern economic toolkit.\n\nBy any measure, 2022 was a terrible year for crypto. In all, more than $2 trillion in largely speculative market value evaporated.\n\nMillions of consumers and businesses lost money, and perhaps more damaging for a nascent industry and technology, the fundamental trust in the promise of crypto-finance, which was supposed to be a correction to many of the misdeeds that gave rise to the 2008 financial crisis, is waning.\n\nMeanwhile, policymakers who have been sounding an alarm about crypto\u2019s excessive risks, while failing to create sensible regulations, have been vindicated by not one, but multiple large-scale failures.\n\nHave you read? Do cryptocurrencies have a future? An expert explains\n\nTo the diehard crypto utopians (and some crypto-anarchists), 2022 was not just another \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d but more of an ice age. Along with a broad loss of confidence, economic value and a market littered with the tombstones of failed firms and projects, perhaps the era of crypto speculation will remain frozen in ice, giving way to a Cambrian explosion for responsible, always-on internet finance.\n\nJust as it took the dot-com bubble bursting in the early 2000s to hand over the future of the internet to more durable companies, business models and use cases, perhaps 2022 marks a handover of crypto technology and blockchain infrastructure to steadier hands.\n\nWhile the underlying technology of cryptography and blockchain is generalizable to all industries and coordinating activities (collectively the building blocks of Web3), experimentation at the core of financial services, among other sectors, continues unabated. Indeed, as a test of the staying power of digital assets and blockchains at the core of financial services (and other areas of the global economy), watch what the big banks and mature financial services firms do, not what they say.\n\nTo the diehard crypto utopians (and some crypto-anarchists), 2022 was not just another \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d but more of an ice age. Image: Coinmetrics\n\nWhile the most famous volte-face on policy towards crypto and blockchain belongs to JPMorgan, they are no longer alone among major financial institutions in embracing Web3. Arguably, just as boards and executive teams reluctantly owned their cybersecurity and digital transformation mandates, the embrace of crypto technology is equally inevitable, even if the term feels like a bad word. For all its faults, this technology remains a protagonist in the global financial world.\n\nHistory is riddled with examples of otherwise good or neutral technologies being co-opted by bad actors and those ever-present human follies of greed, nescience, risks of opportunity or outright criminality. All of which are amplified in emerging, lightly regulated sectors and accelerated by technology. Indeed, no sector is risk-free, especially not one involving money. However, crypto punishes the errant at speed, giving bad actors few places to hide.\n\nRemember how crypto was born from anonymous trading activities on the so-called dark web? Or how insidious global ransomware attacks like WannaCry in 2017 spread worldwide in days, delivered by seemingly innocuous emails and triggered by perilous human curiosity between the keyboard and the chair?\n\nYet we didn't ban the internet or email. The more enduring approach with all breakthrough technologies is to net out their harmful effects by placing technologies (like all tools) in the hands of responsible actors and encouraging their responsible use."

        "content": "The bitcoin miner formerly known as Riot Blockchain has rebranded itself as Riot Platforms.\n\nRiot Platforms said in a Tuesday (Jan. 3) press release that the new name reflects the fact that it is diversifying its business while remaining driven by bitcoin.\n\nAlready active in bitcoin mining and data center hosting, the firm is continuing to expand and diversify its operations and aims to become a leading bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform, according to the press release.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant milestone for Riot and comes as a result of our unique strategic position in the market,\u201d Riot CEO Jason Les said in the release, adding that the company recently added to its bitcoin mining data center capacity by acquiring Whinstone U.S. and enhanced its electrical component engineering and supply chain capabilities by purchasing ESS Metron.\n\n\u201cThe scope and scale of our businesses continues to expand, and this rebranding better reflects our position as strategic allocators of capital to increasingly broaden the scope of our bitcoin-focused operations,\u201d Les said in the release.\n\nBloomberg reported Tuesday that the company had been a maker of diagnostic machinery for the biotech industry called Bioptix before changing its name to Riot Blockchain in 2017 and becoming one of the biggest bitcoin miners in the U.S.\n\nDuring 2022, as the price of bitcoin dropped and several companies in the crypto space went bankrupt, the value of Riot Blockchain\u2019s shares plunged 85%, according to the report.\n\nIn April, at a point where the firm\u2019s shares were down 35%, and several other publicly traded companies that focus on the crypto market were down as well, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that companies serving the market were suffering more during the downturn than the market\u2019s underlying commodity.\n\nAnalysts told the WSJ at the time that stocks of crypto-mining companies were down because they tend to be owned by individual investors who generally trade in and out of shares more than institutional investors.\n\nRiot said in its Tuesday press release that Riot and Whinstone U.S. will brand together under Riot Platforms, Riot\u2019s electrical equipment manufacturing business will continue to operate as ESS Metron and Riot\u2019s common stock will still be listed on Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticket symbol RIOT.\n\nIn addition, Riot will continue to seek opportunities to expand across its business lines, according to the release.\n\nFor all PYMNTS crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto Newsletter."

This instance paved the way for an entire industry to be developed, with millions of people working toward a similar vision for the future of money. 14 years later, many are showing their respect by posting various greetings to the cryptocurrency that started it all.\n\nSome are tipping their hats to the Bitcoin creator by sending small amounts of BTC to their wallet address. Since its creation, many people have randomly sent Bitcoin to the account, pushing its total balance to 68.56 BTC, worth $1.1 million at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoiners have shared various messages, including a video showing the newspaper containing the headline stamped on the genesis block.\n\nOn Dec. 28 \u2014 a week before Bitcoin Genesis Day \u2014 business intelligence firm MicroStrategy added more Bitcoin to its holdings.

        "content": "The Ethereum network eclipsed Bitcoin in terms of total transaction volume last year, though the king of crypto has managed to retain its crown when it comes to online search interest.\n\nAccording to data from Nasdaq and Ycharts shared on Reddit on Jan. 2, there were 338% more Ether (ETH) transactions in 2022 (408.5 million) Bitcoin (BTC) ones (93.1 million).\n\nETH vs BTC transaction volumes - Nasdaq/Ycharts via Reddit\n\nThe values shown in the chart are in millions of transactions, with the average daily transactions at around 1.1 million for ETH and 255,000 for BTC.\n\nHowever, transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were steadier and more periodic than on Ethereum, which experienced much more volatility in transaction volumes. This was due to spikes in demand at certain times such as NFT launches and other gas-guzzling events such as XEN minting.\n\nEthereum\u2019s heftier transaction volumes have continued into the new year, with the Ethereum transaction count on Jan. 2 reaching 924,614, a 300% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 229,191 on the same day, according to Bitinfocharts.\n\nETH vs BTC transaction volumes \u2014 Bitinfocharts\n\nThe analyst who posted the metrics said he was \u201cskeptical about people saying that a flippening could happen someday,\u201d adding that those advocating for it have reason to do so now.\n\nA flippening occurs when one chain surpasses a higher-ranked one for the same metric, in this case, transactions and activity.\n\nThe charts also do not include layer 2 transactions, which would put Ethereum even further ahead of Bitcoin for this metric. According to L2beat, the number of L2 transactions per second actually surpassed those on layer 1 Ethereum in mid-October and has remained above it ever since.\n\nRelated: Why the battle for low or no transaction fees really matters\n\nHowever, while Ethereum may be ahead in transaction and activity terms, Bitcoin remains the most-searched cryptocurrency online.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a newsletter from \u201cIn Bitcoin We Trust\u201d revealed that BTC attracted the most attention on the Google search engine in 2022, with 28.4 million monthly Google searches across the world.\n\nThe report concurred with Cointelegraph, which reported on Dec. 23 that Ethereum did not make second or even third place for search popularity. These spots were occupied by memecoins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) respectively.\n\nEthereum, in fourth place, had 3.8 million global monthly searches, according to the data."

        "content": "MicroStrategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor is explaining why the software company sold some Bitcoin (BTC) despite previously stating that the firm will not sell its crypto holdings.\n\nIn a Twitter Spaces discussion, Saylor says that as a corporation, MicroStrategy is in a position to enjoy tax benefits by selling some of the firm\u2019s Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is traded as property right now, so that means that you can sell the property, take the capital loss and you have the option to buy property in the future or to have bought it in the past and that\u2019s a different tax basis.\n\nWe have some capital gains that we pay taxes on and then we can have some capital losses in Bitcoin, so by selling the Bitcoin and taking the capital loss, we\u2019re able to use that to offset some capital gains. So it\u2019s very tax efficient for the corporation.\u201d\n\nIn a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing submitted on December 28th, MicroStrategy reported that it sold $11.8 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of approximately $16,776 per BTC on December 22nd. The company says the sale of about 704 BTC is for tax purposes.\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin remains bullish on the benchmark cryptocurrency. The SEC filing shows that two days after the sale, MicroStrategy bought more Bitcoin than it sold.\n\n\u201cOn December 24, 2022, MicroStrategy acquired approximately 810 Bitcoins for approximately $13.6 million in cash, at an average price of approximately $16,845 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Source: TradingView\n\nLooking ahead, traders are thus conservative as to what lies in store for BTC/USD as signs of a fundamental shift remain wholly absent from market behavior.\n\n\u201cIt takes a tiny pump into resistance to turn everyone bullish again. This same bull trap has been happening during the entire 2022, yet people don't learn,\u201d Il Capo of Crypto argued on the day:\n\n\u201c12k is very likely.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

As soon as those signals come in, sentiment around risk-on should markedly strengthen.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\nThe Fed will release minutes from its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Jan. 4, providing clear guidance on policy going forward.\n\nFor \u201cBig Short\u201d investor Michael Burry, however, even that more permissive scenario is not the end of the inflation story.\n\n\u201cInflation peaked. But it is not the last peak of this cycle,\u201d he warned in a tweet on Jan. 2:\n\n\u201cWe are likely to see CPI lower, possibly negative in 2H 2023, and the US in recession by any definition. Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard.\u201d\n\nThe results of Fed policy have been clear to see for 2022 stock market performance, with the S&P 500 for example finishing the year 1,000 points below many of the most popular estimates.\n\nWhile markets await the first Wall Street trading day of 2023, the U.S. Dollar Index is already struggling in what could be the year\u2019s first silver lining for crypto assets.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is currently threatening to fall through support unchallenged for over six months, after which the 100-point level reenters.\n\n\u201cMarkets: DXY on the verge of breaking down again, 10yr yields reaching resistance, WTI crude rebounded to resistance, gold paused at resistance, stocks treading water,\u201d Callum Thomas, founder and head of research at macro research house Top Down Charts, summarized in part of Twitter comments on the day.\n\nU.S. dollar index (DXY) 1-week candle chart.

A similar event occurred in July 2022 and another a year prior to that.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin\u2019s public mining companies also continue to feel the strain, with Core Scientific getting a provisional bankruptcy loan of nearly $40 million from creditors including BlackRock.\n\nBTC supply goes to sleep\n\nAs volatility stays absent from Bitcoin for weeks on end, there is understandably little impetus to sell among hodlers.\n\nThe latest on-chain data supports that theory, with the BTC supply becoming increasingly dormant as speculators stay away.\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the amount of the supply stationary in its wallet for the past five to seven years has hit its highest since January 2018.\n\nBTC supply last active 5-7 years ago chart. Source: Glassnode/ Twitter\n\nThat trend has been in place for much of the past year, as those who bought BTC in the last halving cycle see their purchase prices returning.\n\nAs the supply ages, the volume of coins moving on a short-term basis is likewise decreasing, hinting at an absence of knee-jerk speculative trading.\n\nThe amount of the BTC supply last active between three and six months ago is now at five-year lows, Glassnode confirms. Supply active between three and five years ago is now at one-year lows.\n\nBTC supply last active 3-6 months ago chart.

In 2022, it hit lows of 6/100, a score rarely ever seen in Bitcoin\u2019s lifetime.\n\n\u201cDespite a brutal 2022 for crypto in terms of sentiment, I have never been more excited about the industry long term from a fundamentals perspective,\u201d Daniel Cheung, co-founder of investment firm Syncacy Capital, nonetheless concluded in a Twitter thread on Jan. 1.\n\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index (screenshot).

Charlie calls this phenomenon the 'orangutan effect': If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, you may leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.\"\n\n4. \"I know I'll win over time. That doesn't mean I'll beat everybody else, or anything like that. But the game is very, very, very easy if you have the right lessons in your mind about what you're buying.\" (Buffett was underscoring that he views shares as pieces of a business.)\n\n5. \"We have a successor in place, but he's not warming up. I'm in overtime but I'm out there.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \"Elon is taking on General Motors and Ford and Toyota, and all these people who've got all this stuff, and he's got an idea and he's winning. That's America. You can't dream it up. It's astounding.\"\n\n7. \"It couldn't happen but it did. If they'd stopped in Omaha on the drive from New York to Seattle and he'd said, 'What do you think of this idea?' I would have said, 'Good luck, Jeff.'\" (Buffett was referring to Amazon's unlikely evolution from an online bookseller to a technology titan under founder Jeff Bezos.)\n\n8. \"Sometimes the stock market is quite investment-oriented, and other times it's almost totally a casino, a gambling parlor \u2014 and that existed to an extraordinary degree in the last couple of years, encouraged by Wall Street.\"\n\n9. \"If you told me you owned all of the bitcoin in the world, and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it? I would have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \"The best protection against inflation is still your own personal earnings power. The best investment by far is anything that develops yourself.\"\n\nRead more: David Rubenstein views Warren Buffett as the ultimate investor.

        "title": "Bitcoin's 14th Birthday Is No Cause for a Party - PYMNTS.com",
        "content": "The bitcoin network came into existence Jan. 3, 2009, spawning the cryptocurrency market industry.\n\nAmong other things, the peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash equivalent system promised to replace fiat, revolutionize commerce on the internet, and render redundant those financial institutions (FIs) serving as trusted third-party intermediaries by establishing cryptographic proof as the foundation of payment.\n\nFourteen years later, it is primarily those \u201cother things\u201d that have set off a sprawling, investor-centric crypto industry, on-chain Web3 offshoots like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as well as informed public and popular opinion of the digital asset class as primarily a volatile investment vehicle rather than a means of mass commerce.\n\nFiat, or non-commodity backed government issued legal tender, is still very much around. Fiat still drives commerce on the internet, and the role of FIs and central authorities with regard to payments has only grown more important as digital transformations sweep across industry landscapes and consumers increasingly use digital wallets to pay for goods and services.\n\nBut in achieving the primary monetary goal set out in its original white paper, a contemporary pulse check on bitcoin and its applications shows they have so far come up well short.\n\nThe Rise of a by-Product Industry\n\nEmbedded in that first minted on-chain block, the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0) was the text, \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nThe text has been interpreted by industry observers as a snide comment on instability caused by fractional-reserve banking. It references a day-of headline from The Times of London. As stated in its white paper, bitcoin was born of the failures of the 2008 financial crisis and intended to use technology to prevent those mistakes \u2014 and other issues seen as endemic to the traditional finance system \u2014 from happening again.\n\nInstead, some observers say, the crypto industry today operates a lot more like the fractional-reserve banking system than it does the traceless, trustless, technically secure architecture for global alternative transactions that was promised.\n\nIf bitcoin was supposed to be a reinvention of money, the cryptocurrency industry by-products it spawned have been embraced most by speculative investors.\n\nWhile some merchants and consumers flirt with crypto payments for everyday goods and monthly bills, it is the massive, centralized trading exchanges that have come to dominate the industry landscape, and define it through their successes and failures.\n\nElectronic Cash\n\nAs economist David Evans wrote for PYMNTS in the past, one of the benefits of physical cash is it doesn\u2019t require intermediaries. Cash also represents, for many purposes, an entirely anonymous way to transact.\n\nIn a pared downs sense, these were the primary qualities the yet-to-be-unmasked bitcoin founder, known only by the pseudonym \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto,\u201d hoped to replicate by creating an internet-based, decentralized public-ledger-grounded, alternative fiat.\n\nAs a cash equivalent meant for the digital landscape, bitcoin\u2019s early days were regrettably plagued by illicit use by holders of the assets who used the digital currency to purchase contraband on \u201cdark web\u201d marketplaces such as the infamous silk road.\n\nCryptocurrencies more broadly, beyond just bitcoin, continue to be a popular tool for global money laundering.\n\nMore legitimate, state-sanctioned efforts to leverage bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in developing nations are stalling or flat-out failing.\n\nInstead, dozens of governments and central banks around the world are currently exploring the feasibility of designing and launching their own digital currencies rather than relying on blockchain native cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlthough bitcoin was founded with the stated goal of transparency, anonymity and individual economic liberty from governmental oversight, critics argue the inverse appears to be happening, noting that state-based surveillance of citizens is more likely to increase in this arena while at the same time, individual privacy and financial liberty among digital currency users looks set to erode.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Next 14 Years\n\nHistorically, successful payments businesses have tended to have exponential growth in their early years, driven by a positive feedback loop that saw widescale adoption, trust and usage of their platforms. As the theory goes, as more merchants and consumers want to use a payment method, other merchants and consumers will accept and use it, leading to increased uptake.\n\nThis has not been the case for bitcoin, as the crypto industry has become centered on leveraged arbitrage, trading and given rise to its own cottage industry of investment vehicles and platforms, many of which have failed. At the same time, bitcoin as a payment alternative remains an ongoing, will-it-won\u2019t-it experiment while other crypto currencies, like litecoin, attempt to shoulder in and prove their own marketplace viability.\n\nTime is running out for bitcoin to realize its ambitious goal of one day replacing money itself, and belief in that premise appears to be dropping entirely in some corners of the financial industry as the asset matures.\n\nDepending on who you ask, bitcoin is either headed to $1,000,000 or set to suffer a further 70% reduction in value \u2014 a sentiment that seems to sum up bitcoin\u2019s prospect as a payment method. Few want the value of their currency to be based purely on what another person thinks it is worth.\n\nFor all PYMNTS crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto Newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining revenue was down to $9.55 billion in 2022 from $15.3 billion in 2021 \u2013 a 37.5% decline.\n\nSince the peak of a massive rally in 2021, cryptocurrencies have lost more than $2 trillion in market cap to reach below $900 billion. There has been more than a 70% drop in Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest digital coin since it reached an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November. In addition, several high-profile company and project failures have sent shock waves in the past year.\n\nThis all began in May with the collapse of terraUSD, which brought down other firms like Three Arrows Capital, a crypto-oriented hedge fund. Then, in November, FTX, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, collapsed, affecting the industry.\n\nAdditionally, rising interest rates have put pressure on risk assets, such as stocks and crypto, along with crypto-specific failures.\n\nAs investors became wary of volatile assets, deteriorating market conditions also affected miners. Aside from market conditions, miners also faced high electricity costs and record mining difficulty. In 2022, mining difficulty reached a record high due to an increase in hash rate, which left some miners struggling for profitability.\n\nDue to this, the miner\u2019s daily revenue has fallen sharply to $16.173 million \u2013 down from $63.548 million on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nTop Mining firms suffered in 2022\n\nAccording to Hashrate Index, the debt-to-equity ratio more than tripled for many mining firms, indicating greater financial leverage.\n\nCore Scientific has the highest debt-to-equity ratio at 26.7, followed by Greenidge and Stronghold at 18 and 11.1, respectively. Argo also has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 8.7.\n\nAccording to Core Scientific\u2019s balance sheet, as of Sept. 30, the company owed the most, with $1.3 billion in liabilities. The second-largest debtor is Marathon, with $851 million in liabilities.\n\nAs a result, miners with high debt-to-equity ratios, such as Core Scientific (CORZ), filed for bankruptcy. Whereas Greenidge Generation (GREE) and Stronghold Digital Mining restructured their debt obligations.\n\nDue to the bearish sentiment in 2022, miners\u2019 profitability suffered. Bitcoin\u2019s profitability is measured in dollars per terahash, or TH, per second. During its peak in 2017, bitcoin mining generated $3.39/TH per second, but it dropped to $0.104/TH in 2022.\n\nProminent public mining companies suffered considerable losses in 2022 that rose over 90% on average.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Even cryptocurrency\u2019s most accomplished tech wizards apparently aren\u2019t immune from the occasional wallet-draining hack. Luke Dashjr, one of the original core developers for Bitcoin, claims that someone swiped hundreds of BTC from his accounts late last year\u2014leaving him to start 2023 with nothing but an empty wallet and a heart full of woe.\n\nThe Biggest Crypto Heists of 2022\u2026So Far CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video The Biggest Crypto Heists of 2022\u2026So Far\n\nDashjr, who has worked for the Bitcoin Project for the past twelve years, took to Twitter on Sunday to lament the apparent hacking episode. While seemingly distraught, the dev didn\u2019t initially offer much explanation as to how any of this was supposed to have happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter allegedly thieving Dashjr\u2019s personal coin bounty, the hacker supposedly funneled the money to another crypto address, where the assets currently sit. The wallet shows a total of some 216.93 BTC, equivalent to some $3.6 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Dashjr, a cybercriminal managed to get ahold of his PGP key, which then led to a compromise of his hot wallet. PGP, which stands for \u201cPretty Good Privacy,\u201d is a popular security program designed to protect web users via encryption. PGP is typically used to encrypt certain kinds of sensitive information, though it isn\u2019t entirely clear in this instance how a compromise of Dashjr\u2019s key would have enabled the hacking episode.\n\n\n\nMany Twitter users responded to Dashjr\u2019s claims with sympathy, offering condolences for his stolen millions. However, more than a few people weren\u2019t so sure about the developer\u2019s claims. Most were just perplexed as to how something like this could actually happen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDo you a sense of what really happened? Can you share some insights that may help others?\u201d one user asked, to which Dashjr merely replied: \u201cNo idea.\u201d\n\nAnother user questioned why: \u201cHow [does] PGP key lead to losing Bitcoin?\u201d Dashjr responded: \u201cEverything is compromised.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother incredulous user posted: \u201cI don\u2019t buy this. You of all people should have at least some basic Opsec [operational security], and you are leading us to believe you kept over 200 BTC on a hot wallet?\u201d\n\nSome pointed out that tax season was fast approaching. At least one Twitter user accused Dashjr of perpetrating a \u201cboating accident.\u201d Boating accidents are tax avoidance schemes, in which a token holder claims to have lost their digital money to hackers but, in reality, maintains control of the funds and is merely trying to avoid the snooping eye of financial regulators. There is no evidence that this is what Dashjr is doing, though many details of what exactly happened to his money remain unclear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGizmodo reached out to the crypto developer for comment and will update this story if he responds.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if Dashjr would be the first crypto acolyte to get his coinage boosted. Last year showed that there was seemingly no end to the financial mayhem that could be wrought by cybercriminals who targeted the crypto industry. If this incident is any indication, it seems like 2023 won\u2019t be much different."

        "content": "The Australian city of Coolangatta has gotten its first Bitcoin ATM with integrated Lightning Network capabilities. The new ATM has been installed at The Strand shopping center in Coolangatta and is now available for use by the public.\n\nA Bitcoin Lightning ATM works quite similarly to traditional Bitcoin ATMs but saves significant time because of the instant transaction capabilities of the layer-2 Lightning solution. It also allows for purchasing very small amounts of Bitcoin (BTC), mostly in satoshis \u2014 the lowest denomination of Bitcoin, with 1 satoshi equal to 0.00000001 BTC.\n\nAt the moment, cryptocurrency ATMs settle transactions on the blockchain directly, but this has restrictions of its own. For instance, operators had to adapt to batching transactions when miner fees on the Bitcoin network considerably increased between 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn practice, this means that even though a user purchases BTC via an ATM, it is not immediately transmitted to them. Operators have processes in place that wait for other ATM network users to utilize the machines before grouping and sending out transactions for several users at once in one bulk transaction. This problem can be resolved to a significant extent with the help of the Lightning Network.\n\nUsing Lightning, the transaction becomes immediate because the operator doesn\u2019t need to batch the funds \u2014 as soon as cash is inserted, the user receives payment via the Lightning Network. While there is still a debate over whether the fees will be significantly reduced, they will likely be lower than an on-chain payment.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ATM installations record low in May, biggest drop since 2019\n\nThe recent installment of the Lightning-enabled Bitcoin ATM in Australia comes in the wake of the country overtaking El Salvador to become the fourth-largest Bitcoin ATM hub in the world. Australia had 216 ATMs stepping into 2023.\n\nAccording to Coin ATM Radar, the total number of crypto ATMs worldwide is currently 38,602, out of which 6,071 ATMs were installed in 2022 alone."

Some believe that this makes it difficult for normal people to adopt or secure their Bitcoin.\n\nIn a post, a Twitter user was shocked by the news, believing that not many would be able to help the developer and that \u201cthere\u2019s little hope for most.\u201d They tweeted:\n\nYou've definitely been one of the most security conscious folks I've known in this space, so this is a little shocking.

A Twitter user also brought mass adoption to the conversation. They believe that if a top Bitcoin developer cannot keep his wallet secure, mass adoption is a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin analyst Namcios believes that these sentiments are not a fair assessment of the situation.

Apart from Zhao, MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor also discussed the merits of self-custody amid the FTX collapse. Saylor said that custodians \u201caccumulate too much power\u201d in a system where there is no self-custody."

        "content": "At press time, the market cap of the entire crypto-verse is $807.63 billion. This billion-dollar [formerly trillion-dollar] industry began with only one cryptocurrency, Bitcoin [BTC]. The asset set the stage for countless other cryptocurrencies to follow suit over time. However, Bitcoin has been the pinnacle of the digital asset revolution. But where did it all start?\n\nThe \u2018Genesis Block\u2019 opened doors to the very first set of Bitcoins. Satoshi Nakamoto formulated the genesis block exactly 14 years ago on January 3, 2009. On this day, the first batch of 50 BTC was mined into existence.\n\nWhat is the hype around Bitcoin\u2019s Genesis Block?\n\nApart from the fact that it was the origin of Bitcoin, a message from the creator of BTC, Satoshi Nakamoto is what makes this block stand out. Over 90 percent of BTC has already been mined and the blocks that followed suit came with no message. After mining the first set of Bitcoins, Nakamoto wrote in the code of the block,\n\n\u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what this line is all about, it was taken verbatim from the headline of a London Times article published on January 3, 2009. It reportedly described how the British government had bailed out banks.\n\nAlthough Nakamoto never explicitly stated what the message meant, many assumed that it was a reference to the reason behind the creation of Bitcoin. BTC was rolled out for a plethora of reasons. Financial freedom was one of the primary objectives. The above message is likely to show how Bitcoin bypassed middlemen and banks that Nakamoto believed to be dishonest and unreliable in favor of developing a more democratic form of money.\n\nIn addition to this, the above message has been the only form of communication from Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Nakamoto mined Bitcoins for several years following the creation of the Genesis Block. However, in 2011, Nakamoto disappeared and hasn\u2019t moved his stash of Bitcoins over the past 10 years.\n\nBlock 1 or Block 0?\n\nThe meaning of genesis by the Merriam-Webster dictionary is that it is \u201cthe origin or coming into being of something.\u201d Therefore, it is common to assume that the genesis block is Block 1 of the Bitcoin blockchain. However, it is actually Block 0.\n\nOwning to its block height, or how far it is from the very first block in the blockchain, the Bitcoin genesis block, which was once known as \u201cblock 1,\u201d is now typically called \u201cblock 0\u201d by existing users.\n\nBlock 1, the next block, wasn\u2019t mined until January 9, six days later. The average timestamp difference between blocks is ten minutes, therefore this is unusual.\n\nHowever, several explanations for the delay were put forth. Several speculated that Nakamoto spent a total of six days mining the first block to verify the stability of the Bitcoin system.\n\nHere\u2019s how Bitcoin\u2019s Genesis Block was mined\n\nSince nobody even knew it existed at the time, and it wasn\u2019t worth anything in any fiat currency, Nakamoto mined the first block on a CPU without any competition.\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin was more of an experiment than a currency or a store of value asset. These blocks were placed at difficulty 1, which is extremely low compared to the current bitcoin difficulty, therefore it would be quite simple for existing miners to solve them.\n\nAdditionally, it was only after a year that BTC garnered traction.\n\nWhat\u2019s the current status of Block 0?\n\n50 bitcoins that could not be utilized or were never spent were included in the Bitcoin Genesis Block. Certain individuals assume it was on purpose. However, a few others claim that this was a mistake that Nakamoto made.\n\nNevertheless, the rewards from the block were transferred to the address, 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. The address now has more than 66 BTC in it, of which 50 are still unspent."

        "title": "Erik Voorhees tips $40K BTC by June, but little consensus among pundits - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "There is little agreement among Bitcoin\u2019s commentators over the last few weeks, with crypto execs, research analysts and billionaire investors offering wildly different takes on what's in store for Bitcoin for the year ahead.\n\nOne crypto exchange founder expects Bitcoin (BTC) to spike to $40,000 by the summer, while a Bitcoin billionaire has renewed his bullish $250,000 BTC price prediction for the year.\n\nErik Voorhees \u2014 $40,000 by the \u201csummer\u201d\n\nErik Voorhees, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, was optimistic about a potential recovery of Bitcoin\u2019s price during an interview with Bankless on Jan. 2, stating he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if Bitcoin (BTC) hit \u201clike $40K\u201d by the \u201csummer.\u201d\n\nVoorhees noted that if his prediction were to come true that would be \u201c2.5X\u201d from its current price of $16,666, which he said is a \u201cgreat return.\u201d\n\nThe crypto executive couldn\u2019t pinpoint the timing of the next bull run, only saying it would come sometime within the next \u201csix months to three years.\u201d\n\nHe shut down the idea that it could take as much as \u201c10 years,\u201d however, arguing that if that happened it would mean the whole \u201cthing [...] probably failed.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Voorhees said that the macro environment, interest rates and the tightening of monetary conditions are big factors in how the crypto market will play out this year.\n\nHe also acknowledged that the reputation of crypto from outsiders is \u201cjust trash\u201d but those commentators will also be the ones to be \u201cblindsided\u201d when the next rally happens.\n\nVoorhees said that whether we are in a bull or bear market, we are \u201cin the middle of a revolution right now.\u201d\n\nTim Draper \u2014 $250,000 by April 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin billionaire investor Tim Draper has continued to knuckle down on his $250,000 Bitcoin prediction via his most recent Twitter post on Jan. 1, showing he even has it printed on a T-shirt.\n\nDraper first made the bold $250,000 Bitcoin price prediction during a speech at his own Draper University in San Mateo in April 2018.\n\nAt the time, he said he was looking into what he described as a \u201ccrystal ball,\u201d saying he was \u201cthinking\u201d of $250,000 for a Bitcoin by 2022.\n\nDraped said people would perceive those that believe in the prediction as \u201ccrazy,\u201d but reassured his audience it would happen and be \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\nIn his most recent tweet, Draper conceded that his \u201c$250K by 2022\u201d prediction was \u201coff by a bit\u201d but said he believes it \u201ccertainly\u201d will happen before the Bitcoin halving, which is set for April 2024 according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nHis bullish prediction was however met with varied comments on Twitter, with one user tweeting that they had \u201clost interest\u201d in the price of Bitcoin since Celsius stole the \u201cone Bitcoin\u201d they had, another tweeted \u201cyou have high hopes,\u201d while another predicted that it is \u201cunlikely\u201d to even go \u201cabove $30K in 2023.\u201d\n\nMike McGlone \u2014 $100,000 by 2025\n\nDraper\u2019s comments could be seen as particularly bullish even among Bitcoin supporters.\n\nIn September, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone \u2014 who has been optimistic about the future of Bitcoin in the past \u2014 tapped the crypto to only reach $100,000 by 2025.\n\nHe's made that prediction once before, during an interview in October 2020 where he said Bitcoin is \u201con track\u201d to hit \u201c$100,000 by 2025.\u201d A year later, he stood by that prediction in an interview with Kitco News, saying it\u2019s only a \u201cmatter of time\u201d to get to \u201c$100,000.\u201d\n\nHe saidthe reason for this is that supply is still \u201cgoing down,\u201d while adoption and demand are \u201cstill increasing.\u201d\n\nStandard Chartered \u2014 $5,000 in 2023\n\nIn December, United Kingdom-based banking firm Standard Chartered predicted Bitcoin could drop to as low as $5,000 in 2023 as one of the possible \"financial-market surprises\" of the year.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 5 report from CNBC, rising yields and a plunge in tech stocks could lead to an acceleration of a Bitcoin sell-off, causing further bankruptcies and collapses in crypto and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets.\n\nHowever, the author of the investor note, Eric Robertsen \u2014 the firm's global head of research \u2014 noted that this was an extreme prediction that fell outside its own baseline views and outside of market consensus.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Jack: \"I try to think more about when than where\" for price\n\nWhile some crypto industry figures have been confident enough to share their Bitcoin forecasts for the years ahead, others have been more reserved in sharing their thoughts on the subject.\n\nCo-founder and managing partner of digital asset management platform Nexo, Antoni Trenchev, recently explained to Cointelegraph that there are \u201cmany factors\u201d that can influence the price of Bitcoin.\n\nAlex McCurry, CEO and co-founder of blockchain solution provider Solidify.io, told Cointelegraph on Jan. 3 that \u201cBitcoin is a completely unpredictable asset.\u201d\n\nThe uthor of the best-selling book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, hasn't made any price predictions in recent months either, despite frequently posting about Bitcoin on his Twitter page.\n\nIn December, Kiyosaki said he was investing in Bitcoin and is \"very excited\" about it due to it being classified as a commodity much like gold, silver and oil, unlike other crypto tokens which he said have been classified as securities."

        "title": "Erik Voorhees Predicts When the Next Bitcoin Bull Market Will Start - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Erik Voorhees \u2013 CEO of ShapeShaft and an outspoken proponent of bitcoin \u2013 believes it could take between six months and three years before the next crypto bull run occurs.\n\nHe also predicted that the primary cryptocurrency could surge to $40,000 by the summer, representing a 140% increase compared to current valuations.\n\n\u2018It Won\u2019t be Ten Years\u2019\n\nIn a recent interview for Bankless Shows, Voorhees argued that the reigning crypto winter will not last for another decade. However, if this is the case, then \u201cprobably the whole thing failed,\u201d he added.\n\nThe American thinks crypto could enter into a bull run as early as half a year since \u201cthat\u2019s generally how long it takes people\u2019s minds to start changing and speculative cycles to return.\u201d\n\nHe believes the volatility of the market in the near future will depend on multiple key factors, including the interest rates announced by the Federal Reserve, the macroeconomic environment, and the implementation of possible regulations.\n\nIf conditions improve, bitcoin could soar to $40,000 by the summer. Assuming his forecast comes true, this would result in 2.5X profit for investors who decide to enter the ecosystem now:\n\n\u201cIt also has a lot to do with the macro environment. As long as interest rates are held high and monetary conditions are tighter, it\u2019s going to be a headwind. That\u2019ll start changing in early to mid [2023]. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if bitcoin was at like $40,000 by the summer. That wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all. And that\u2019s like 2.5X from here. So it\u2019s a great return.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoorhees touched upon some severe catastrophes that shuttered the industry in 2022, such as the collapse of centralized organizations (with FTX, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, and Voyager Digital). He advised consumers to protect themselves by relying on self-custody methods:\n\n\u201cBut that lesson is really the one because if the majority of crypto funds and crypto wealth reside with intermediaries: A) we will never escape the regulation that this stuff is meant to escape, and B) we will never escape the need to trust humans.\u201d\n\nOther Predictions\n\nSome estimate that the prolonged bear market for bitcoin will end in 2024 when the next BTC halving will occur. One proponent of that thesis is Mark Yusko \u2013 CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management \u2013 who said:\n\n\u201cThen when we get to summer, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll get the next speculative move, and guess is that will come in anticipation of the next halving in 2024.\u201d\n\nHunter Horsley \u2013 CEO of Bitwise \u2013 believes the next bull run will happen this year, adding that price declines are a great opportunity for people to increase their exposure to the primary digital asset."

        "content": "In a recent piece titled \u201cCrypto will be fine,\u201d former CoinDesker Brady Dale noted that even though crypto has taken a beating throughout the year that was, there are some indicators that remain bullish. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate (how much computational power is directed towards securing the network) remains steadfast.\n\n\u201cIf the industry were dying, these miners should be winding down. They aren't,\u201d Dale wrote. Indeed, according to Blockchain.com data, Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate is just a ways off its all-time high set in November, 2022.\n\nThis article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hashrate rose steadily over the past 12 months even as the network\u2019s token, bitcoin, lost over two-thirds of its value. For many, this is a sign of faith in the long term success of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency network.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s more to the story than a single statistic. As Compass Mining\u2019s Zack Voell (another ex-CoinDesker) detailed in a Monday report, the bitcoin mining industry took a series of beatings in 2022.\n\nIn his catalog of \u201call of the bad things that miners suffered,\u201d Voell found that at least four executives of major mining firms resigned over the year, six lawsuits have been filed against mining companies \u2013 for reasons stretching from breach of contract to zoning rule violations \u2013 and stocks for publicly-traded mining companies are in the doldrums.\n\nAdditionally, two mining companies, Core Scientific and Compute North, filed for bankruptcy while Celsius and BlockFi, two bankrupt crypto lending firms with sizable mining wings, are likely going to have to restructure their operations. Another two mining companies, Marathon and Argo, are also at risk of declaring bankruptcy.\n\nRead more: Inside Core Scientific\u2019s Prearranged Bankruptcy\n\nThe situations vary by firm, but the main causes of the issue stem from BTC\u2019s depressed price and, often, poor treasury management. My colleague George Kaloudis simplified the picture by saying that over the last few years many mining companies pursued accelerated growth strategies financed by debt and other investments while often choosing to hold onto their mined coins.\n\n\"Many miners acted too deterministically,\" projecting bitcoin would hit $100,000, Juri Bulovic, head of mining at crypto mining and staking firm Foundry, which is owned by CoinDesk\u2019s parent company, Digital Currency Group, told CoinDesk\u2019s Eliza Gkritsi. The situation worked well when bitcoin\u2019s price was rising and the cost of financing expansion was cheap \u2013 two things thrown off course amid macroeconomic uncertainty and rising interest rates.\n\nAlready, outside firms have been stepping in to backstop losses and inject much-needed capital into the lagging professional mining sector. Galaxy Digital struck a $100 million deal with Argo, Binance has spun up a fund for distressed miners and just today investment giant BlackRock committed $17 million to bankrupt bitcoin miner Core Scientific.\n\nAlthough the mining sector is in a precarious position \u2013 fueled in part by unprecedented deployment of state-of-the-art mining equipment order and deployed during the heady days of 2021, when bitcoin hit a high of $69,000 \u2013 the industry isn\u2019t likely going to be wiped off the map. In addition to battle-tested firms deploying better treasury management, there are also a line of new financing options coming online \u2013 like derivatives options from Two Prime, which could allow miners to hedge their risk over mining bitcoin in a similar way as in other commodities markets like oil.\n\nMore capitulation and bankruptcies could come, and unprofitable miners may be taken offline. But considering the global sprawl of the mining industry, the sectors\u2019 committed activist investors and supporters and the growing importance of mining within the hydrocarbon and wider energy sector mining will remain. And the business might be better for its recent troubles.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "On January 13, 2009, the genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain was mined by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, marking the first time in history that a completely digital and decentralized currency went online. In the 14 years and three halvings since, Bitcoin has grown to become one of the most important financial instruments, clearly demonstrating that a non-central bank-controlled currency is capable of challenging the established monetary order.\n\nWith that in mind, what important events have taken place in the last 14 years, and how has Bitcoin price fared through the ups and downs? What can we expect from Bitcoin going forward? Read along to find out the answer to these questions and more.\n\nOn its 14th birthday, Bitcoin\u2019s message rings louder than ever\n\nThe first Bitcoin transaction was sent by Satoshi Nakamoto to American cryptographer Hal Finney, along with a message criticizing government and bank actions in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWith the growing macroeconomic turmoil and the failure of central banks to keep up with inflation problems \u2013 in large part due to the unprecedented growth in money supply during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s artificially capped coin supply and decentralized network can be seen as the leading alternative to traditional, inherently inflationary fiat currencies.\n\n10 most important Bitcoin milestones\n\nBitcoin has reached numerous major milestones and faced several considerable obstacles over its nearly decade-and-a-half-long history. Here are 10 events we believe have had the biggest impact on Bitcoin so far:\n\nBetween its third halving on one end and FTX filing for bankruptcy on the other, Bitcoin has seen some remarkable market activity over the last couple of years.\n\nWhat can we expect from Bitcoin going forward? With the fourth Bitcoin halving approaching and favorable historical price data in play, our Bitcoin price prediction algorithm forecasts BTC price to grow by over +150% and break $40,000 in the next year. We\u2019ll explore that in more detail in the following section.\n\nBitcoin has never closed in the red zone 2 years in a row: Will the trend continue?\n\nBitcoin price decreased by over -60% over the span of the last 12 months. However, there is a strong bullish precedent in play that could spell a major trend reversal in the coming months.\n\nFor starters, Bitcoin has never closed in the negative two years in a row. Granted, there is a relatively short set of historical price data to work with. However, roughly speaking, Bitcoin has operated on 3 years of growth followed by 1 year of market retracement periods, at least so far.\n\nBitcoin price % Change Year-over-Year Jan 3, 2011 - Year 2 $0.295 No available data Jan 3, 2012 - Year 3 $4.88 +1,544% Jan 3, 2013 - Year 4 $13.40 +175% Jan 3, 2014 - Year 5 $818 +6,004% Jan 3, 2015 - Year 6 $284 -65% Jan 3, 2016 - Year 7 $429 +51% Jan 3, 2017 - Year 8 $1,044 +143% Jan 3, 2018 - Year 9 $15,079 +1,344% Jan 3, 2019 - Year 10 $3,844 -74% Jan 3, 2020 - Year 11 $7,317 +90% Jan 3, 2021 - Year 12 $32,878 +349% Jan 3, 2022 - Year 13 $46,424 +41% Jan 3, 2023 - Year 14 $16,729 -64%\n\nBitcoin has never closed in the red zone for 2 years in a row.\n\nThe main reason for this \u201c3 to 1\u201d cycle lies in the fact that Bitcoin halvings are scheduled to take place every 4 years. When a Bitcoin halving is triggered, BTC miners receive only half the reward that they were receiving before the halving. The next and 4th BTC halving \u2013 slated to occur between February 2024 and June 2024 \u2013 will see the miner reward rate drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, BTC investors are excited about upcoming halvings as they are seen as a positive influence on the Bitcoin price. Case in point, preceding halvings have always been accompanied by storing price growth, as can be seen from the Bitcoin halving chart down below.\n\nBitcoin halvings have been one of the most important BTC price drivers.\n\nThere is no question that Bitcoin, along with most crypto and traditional assets, performed quite poorly last year. With more interest rate hikes slated for 2023, financial markets and crypto assets could continue crashing, at least in the upcoming months.\n\nHowever, there is a clear chance of recovery in the cards, highlighted by the cyclical nature of Bitcoin\u2019s price and its correlation with periodical Bitcoin halvings. This has made Bitcoin one of the most popular long-term crypto investments."

        "title": "Happy birthday to a 'giant Ponzi scheme', from bitcoin's accidental co-creator - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIt\u2019s 14 years exactly since the launch of bitcoin and one big mystery remains unanswered: why is the front page headline of a UK newspaper from Saturday, January 3, 2009, baked into the code of the first bitcoin block?\n\nJanuary 3 has become Independence Day among those who fear centralisation, with the genesis block their digital Liberty Bell. Hiding a bank bailout reference in bitcoin\u2019s foundation stone was more than a timestamp or lorem ipsum, they reason; it was Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s way of telling the world that crypto meant freedom. No more reckless government intervention in monetary policy, no more debasement of fiat to save private enterprises, etc.\n\nThis is not a view shared by Francis Elliott, former political editor of The Times, who wrote the story. Crypto is \u201cnothing more than a giant Ponzi scheme\u201d and \u201can absolute scam\u201d, he told FT Alphaville.\n\n\u201cI first heard about my connection [to bitcoin] maybe six, seven maybe eight years ago* when people started tagging me on Twitter. They all thought it was really cute that I\u2019d only just found out,\u201d he said, emphasising the back half of the sentence by adopting a Californian accent.\n\nElliott said he has never bought crypto. Nor has he considered turning his accidental fame into a career as a crypto influencer. He also, when prompted, denied being Satoshi.\n\nNevertheless, coinbros would often find him online and offer him \u201cbits of bitcoins\u201d that he deposited in a wallet created specifically for the purpose. These unprompted donations amounted to \u00a31500 at the market peak, which was around when he cashed out after gifting \u201cabout \u00a310 each\u201d in tokens to his sons.\n\nElliott offers no explanation as to why his slightly speculative story about UK bad bank proposals became embedded in crypto\u2019s alpha block.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those stories I was relieved was right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an OK source but . . . well, it was a Christmas New-Year story. I\u2019ve no idea why [Nakamoto] used that piece or who he is. Perhaps he knew something we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBecause of its place in crypto history, copies of The Times from January 3, 2009, have held their value better than most cryptocurrencies. Back-issue websites and online auction houses show zero availability. The \u201cGenesis Block Newspaper\u201d market quotes asking prices of up to $1.3mn and claims \u201conly eight verified copies\u201d exist, which might ring false for anyone who has ever visited a UK library.\n\nHas Elliott kept a souvenir copy?\n\n\u201cI did get the front page framed, but I lost it,\u201d he said.\n\n* A Twitter search pins the exact date of discovery to December 18, 2013."

        "content": "Zion, a new social media app on the blockchain, is starting to gain momentum. By bringing base features people need from a social app, Zion might become one of the first web3-based social media platforms. Mainly focusing on communication and payments, Zion could be a future super app (similar to how Elon wants to turn Twitter into \u201cX\u201d or WeChat).\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nLike Web3 wallets, Zion allows anyone to log into any site on the web without creating an account while having their preferences intact, as your preference data is not erased but is owned by you. Zion team explained how it works, \u201cWhen you join Zion, you will be assigned a new DID as well as a user name. This DID will be secured by a 12-word seed phrase to ensure your privacy and security. Zion has no access to these cryptographic private keys.\u201d\n\nFeatures of Zion\n\nZion mainly offers three features:\n\nFirst, the app shows communities with various interests, like chess, Porsche lovers, or conservationists. This allows the user to find people who have similar interests to them. Conversations are in the shapes of threads that feel \u2018personal and contextual.\u2019\n\nFocused on safety and security, they offer an encrypted chat function.\n\nAs expected from any app trying to be a \u2018super app,\u2019 payments are essential to enable in-app purchases and be used as part of revenue by taking a percentage from the money transfers. They use Bitcoin Lightning Network to accomplish this.\n\nWhat is perhaps most exciting about this app is its true peer to peer network. The data produced on this app isn\u2019t stored in any central server but is based on cryptographic keys and signatures, meaning is owned and reachable solely by the user. One of the best symptoms of this is cutting out the manipulation of algorithms. The decentralized node acts as a secure, private server, accessible only by your private key, giving people full custody over their data.\n\nZion launched its first version in August 2021 and the second in June 2022. In an official release, Zion said the v2 would use a Decentralized Web Platform from Block, Jack Dorsey\u2019s company, formerly called Square, and will be built in Web5 (web2+web3=web5).\n\nHow to Join\n\nThe wait list for Zion is available on its official site. The app can be downloaded on both iOS and Android.\n\nThe product will be rolled out in stages. Currently over 60k people have joined the waitlist."

Therefore, the drop in millionaire addresses highlights how far the crypto market has fallen from the 2021 bull run,\" the report said.\n\nIt is worth noting that the declining number of Bitcoin millionaires is not solely an impact of the plunging prices.\n\n\"With Bitcoin undergoing a free fall in recent weeks, the likelihood of holders liquidating their assets increased to avoid further losses.

The newest production number translates to a significant year-over-year increase and visible growth of available computing power.\n\nThe available Bitfarm's hash rate has doubled over the year, rising from 2.2 exahashes per second (EH/s) reported in December 2021 to 4.5 EH/s today.\n\nFor the entire of 2022, the number of BTC mined reached 5,167, growing 49.6% compared to the 3,453 reported for 2021. This means that the company mined more than 14 BTC daily during the last year. The average for December came in at 16 BTC, the equivalent of $265,600 per day, considering market prices as of 31 December 2022.\n\nKeep Reading OKX Joins Growing List of Crypto Exchanges with Singapore's MPI License\n\n\"With the 496 BTC mined in December, our total 2022 BTC mined reached 5,167, up 50% over 2021. We averaged 16.0 BTC mined per day during December. In the month, we deployed new miners and underclocked our least cost-efficient miners. This improved their efficiency by 15%, resulting in a reduction of nearly 4 MW of power consumption and representing substantial cost savings,\" Ben Gagnon, the Chief Mining Officer of Bitfarms, said.\n\nBitfarms Mining Operations\n\nIn December, Bitfarms temporarily suspended Quebec farm operations in support of the local community amid the onslaught of extreme winter, restoring some 4,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of power to the local grids. Such energy curtailments occur every winter and are a normal part of the miner's operations.\n\nHowever, the company has expanded its operations at two other farms, providing access to additional electrical power and mining potential.\n\n\"In December, we energized the remaining portions of The Bunker and Garlock farms, executing our Canadian expansion plan two and one-half months ahead of schedule,\" Geoff Morphy, the CEO of Bitfarms, said.\n\n\"We have positioned ourselves for strategic growth with minimal cash outlay in 2023.\"\n\nBitfarms Sees Higher Production with Lower Revenues\n\nAlthough the publicly-listed miner was able to increase its Bitcoin production significantly, the overall financials seemed to deteriorate in 2022. According to the financial report for the three months that ended 30 September 2022, revenue stood at $33.2 million, falling from $44.8 million reported in the same period a year earlier.\n\nNet loss in the third quarter was $84.8 million after the company earned $23.7 million a year earlier. In the first nine months of 2022, the miner's loss reached $222.2 million. The main reason for the deepening loss is the rapidly falling prices of the major cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nAccording to data from Nasdaq and Ycharts, the Ethereum network had a higher total transaction volume compared to Bitcoin in 2022. Specifically, there were 338 percent more transactions on the Ethereum network (408.5 million) than on the Bitcoin network (93.1 million). The average daily number of transactions on Ethereum was around 1.1 million, while the average daily number of transactions on Bitcoin was 255,000. Despite this, Bitcoin has remained more popular in terms of online search interest.Transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were more consistent and regular compared to those on the Ethereum network, which saw more fluctuations. This was attributed to times of increased demand, such as during the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other activities that required a lot of gas (a measure of the amount of computing power needed to perform a certain action on the Ethereum network), such as the minting of XEN.Ethereum has continued to have higher transaction volumes in 2023, with the number of transactions on the Ethereum network on January 2 reaching 924,614, which is a 300 percent increase compared to the Bitcoin network on the same day (229,191).The person who shared the data on Reddit expressed scepticism about the idea that the Ethereum network could surpass the Bitcoin network in terms of transaction volume and activity, a phenomenon known as a \"flippening.\" However, they noted that those who advocate for a flippening now have more reason to do so, given the current transaction volumes. A flippening occurs when one blockchain surpasses another in a particular metric, such as transaction volume or activity.Although Ethereum may currently have higher transaction and activity levels, Bitcoin remains the most searched crypto online. On January 1, data from \"In Bitcoin We Trust\" showed that Bitcoin had the highest number of monthly Google searches globally in 2022, with 28.4 million searches. Ethereum did not even come in second or third place in terms of search popularity. These spots were occupied by memecoins Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, respectively. According to the data, Ethereum was in fourth place with 3.8 million global monthly searches."

        "title": "Dear Elon Musk: Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin has the ability to scale - CoinGeek",
        "content": "The following letter, originally written by Bryan Daugherty (Director of Blockchain Policy at Bitcoin Association for BSV), was sent to Elon Musk (business magnate, investor, and current CEO of Twitter). The author has granted permission to publish this letter publicly in the hope that it will reach a wider audience and attempt to gain the attention of Elon Musk.\n\nDear Mr. Musk,\n\nI hope this letter finds you well and in good spirits. As a highly respected innovator in the tech industry, I wanted to express my admiration for your work and the many ways in which you continue to contribute towards the advancement of society, both culturally and technologically.\n\nBased on your public statements, it seems that we have differing viewpoints when it comes to the utility of blockchain technology, specifically proof-of-work consensus mechanisms for data and financial interchange.\n\nUnbeknownst to most in the digital asset space, including some of the foremost experts, Bitcoin has the ability to scale, as originally expressed by Satoshi Nakamoto in April of 2009: \u201cBitcoin can already scale much larger than [Visa] with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling.\u201d\n\nNavigating the complex landscape of social crypto influencers, Ponzi schemes, and illegal security offerings can be difficult, but it is important to understand that blockchain technology represents a different type of opportunity\u2014one that is less volatile and speculative, and mirrors some of the greatest technological leap\u2019s humanity has experienced, albeit without the same level of fanfare.\n\nIn terms of whether proof-of-work can scale, the answer may not be as complicated as the journey to understand it. Since block #556767 was mined on November 15th, 2018, BSV developers have been breaking proof-of-work scaling barriers which were once believed to be inconceivable.\n\nMNP, a prominent accounting, tax, and business consulting firm in Canada, has conducted extensive research on the topic of Bitcoin and has recently published two reports on the importance of the original Bitcoin protocol, the impact of changes to the popular BTC version on its capabilities, and how the competing version, BSV, has been able to harness the native scaling capabilities that were present when the system was first released.\n\nUnbounded scaling enables new possibilities in the realm of microtransactions, IPv6 compatibility, extreme data efficiency, verifiable identity, and secure critical infrastructure, providing a great opportunity for innovators like yourself to capitalize on the most efficient, resilient, globally stable, and secure data distribution model.\n\nAs an example, SpaceX could use IPv6 in combination with BSV to transmit financial transactions securely and efficiently with its customers for its internet service. Tesla could use BSV to trace the origin of materials in its supply chain management, track and maintain vehicles, trade energy, or even utilize IPv6 to enable secure communication between vehicles, charging stations, and other devices. In addition, utilizing BSV blockchain as a cybersecurity solution, it is possible to protect the internal network of every company against unauthorized access or data breach.\n\nThis is due to Bitcoin\u2019s native ability to monetize, manage, and secure data. Often overlooked by most, Bitcoin is the fusion of data (bits) and coin (finance). With the capability to currently handle over 50,000 transactions per second, it is now possible to send micropayments, monetize data, transfer data, and capture an immutable time-stamped audit trail of all activity on a network.\n\nThe UTXO model of Bitcoin makes it scalable and capable of parallel processing, enabling almost instantaneous, real-time payments with settlement times of just seconds and fees that are a fraction of a cent (less than 1/5000th of a penny). The potential uses and benefits of Bitcoin are virtually limitless.\n\nOne of the key advantages of using BSV as the underlying infrastructure on a platform like Twitter, is the potential to allow users to earn micropayments for their content. By utilizing BSV-based tokens, loyalty points, or digital assets, users can be rewarded for producing high quality content that is valuable to the community. This not only encourages users to create higher quality content, but it also helps to establish a more sustainable business model for the platform.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, using a scalable blockchain like BSV could also give users greater control over their data. With traditional social media platforms, users have little say in how their data is used or who has access to it. By storing user data on the BSV blockchain, users can have greater control over who has access to their information and how it is used.\n\nFurthermore, a BSV-based social media platform could also have a native marketplace for users to create, buy, and sell digital assets, as well as monetize content such as art, music, and blogs. This would open up new revenue streams for both the platform and its users.\n\nUsing a blockchain like BSV could also enable in-app payments, allowing users to make purchases easily and securely within the app. This could be particularly useful for purchasing premium content or accessing exclusive features such as with Twitter Blue.\n\nFinally, I wanted to applaud your efforts in respect to the Twitter Files. It is of utmost importance that transparency and accountability is a high priority for social media platforms, especially in light of increasing levels of cyber-bullying and fake accounts.\n\nOverall, I believe that the adoption of a blockchain like BSV has the potential to revolutionize social media platforms like Twitter and bring numerous benefits to both the platform and its users. I hope that you will consider this perspective and the potential for these technologies to improve the user experience and business model of Twitter.\n\nI would like to request the opportunity to further discuss the potential benefits of the BSV Blockchain, as well as to invite you to the London Blockchain Conference on May 31- June 2nd at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London. This conference will showcase innovative technologies and businesses working to transform industries and build the new internet of value.

Analysts infer that the more inactivity exists, the more BTC is being hodled, thus reducing sell pressure and acting as a tailwind for bullish price action.\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s analysis of Glassnode data showed the percentage of supply held for less than six months has fallen to its lowest level.\n\nBitcoin Supply Last Active falls to new lows\n\nWith the arrival of 2023, hopes are high that Bitcoin will reverse the negative price action that characterized the previous year.\n\nThe cohort of Bitcoiners who held for six months or less currently comes in at around three million BTC, which equates to 15% of the total circulating supply \u2013 the lowest-ever percentage.\n\nThe previous instance of the lowest Supply Last Active was during the bottom of the 2015 bear market, which occurred in Q4 of the year, as the metric touched 17%. From that point, over two years, the Bitcoin price grew from $200 to $20,000.\n\nAnalysis of past data showed younger coins typically come in volume during two key events:\n\nBull markets as longer-term investors spend and divest into market strength.

        "content": "The year 2022 had been plagued with news around crypto hacks and it ended on a similar note when one of the core developers of Bitcoin took to Twitter to inform that he'd lost \"basically\" all his BTC as a result of a hack.\n\n\n\nIn a 1 January Twitter post, Luke Dashjr alleged that the hacker had somehow gained access to his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) Key. This is a widely-used security method that uses two keys to encrypt sensitive information.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMore than $3.6 million stolen\n\nDashjr posted a thread on Twitter where he mentioned the wallet address where his stolen BTC had been sent but did not talk about the amount of BTC that was stolen.\n\n\n\nPSA: My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help please. #Bitcoin \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) January 1, 2023\n\nHe also told a Twitter user in the thread that he got to know about the recent hack when he received emails from Coinbase and Kraken about suspicious login attempts.\n\n\n\nAccording to a Cointelegraph report, the wallet address in question shows four transactions on 31 December with the total value amounting to $3.6 million, which is roughly 216.39 BTC.\n\n\n\nIn the thread, Dashjr mentioned that he had \"no idea\" how his account was compromised and how the hacker gained access to his security key. However, one of the users on Twitter pointed out a possible connection with an earlier Twitter post by Dashjr on 17 November where he mentioned that his server had been compromised by \"new malware/backdoors on the system\".\n\n\n\nPSA: My server was accessed this morning by an unknown person. Full analysis in progress, but take extra care that you PGP-verified any downloads. #Bitcoin \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) November 17, 2022\n\nThis incident has caught the eyes of some prominent figures in the crypto space, especially the CEO of Binance, CZ Zhao, who offered his support and condolences to Dashjr in a post. \u201cSorry to see you lose so much. Informed our security team to monitor. If it comes our way, we will freeze it. If there is anything else we can help with, please let us know. We deal with these often, and have Law Enforcement (LE) relationships worldwide,\" he wrote.\n\nSome suggest foul play\n\nThough many have come in support of Dashjr, there are a few who have speculated that lex security was the reason the hack could be conducted successfully. A user on Reddit suggested that Dashjr may not have taken the earlier 17 November security breach \"seriously enough\" and later suggested that Dashjr might not have kept his Bitcoin on a more secure device, suggesting that \"he had a hot wallet on the same computer he did everything else.\n\n\n\nAlso, there are a few users who feel that Dashjr might have been complacent with his seed phrase or it could have been part of a \"boating accident\". A boating accident is basically a meme repurposed by the crypto community to cite when someone is trying to avoid paying taxes by claiming that his crypto assets have been stolen. Post the hack, many crypto influencers and even CZ Zhao have cautioned the crypto community regarding the self-custody of crypto."

        "title": "14 years since Genesis Block: The world still needs Bitcoin's original vision - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Happy Genesis Block Day! January 3 is the 14th anniversary of Bitcoin\u2019s Block Zero, its anchor in time. That time, in 2009, was one of economic turmoil\u2014and the aftershocks from that turmoil are still rocking our world in 2023.\n\nBut first, a reminder of how the \u201cGenesis Block,\u201d as Block 0 has come to be known, is not like other Bitcoin blocks.\n\nFirstly, the Genesis Block was never \u201cmined\u201d like every other Bitcoin block. That started with Block #1 when Satoshi Nakamoto released the software on SourceForge. The hash from Block #0 was done with different software and hard-coded into the original Bitcoin protocol.\n\nAs the man behind the \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d name, Dr. Craig S. Wright, tells it, Block #1 was mined six days after the Genesis Block. The Bitcoin software \u201cfell over\u201d after machines on Dr. Wright\u2019s rural server farm patched and rebooted, requiring a trip to the farm and urgent reconfiguration before the network could begin its 14-year (so far) journey for real.\n\n\u201cThe network forked and split, and it was a big mess to say the least,\u201d Dr. Wright wrote.\n\nWhenever someone on Twitter asks, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t Craig Wright spend Bitcoins from the Genesis Block?\u201d it\u2019s a sign that person knows nothing about Bitcoin. It\u2019s impossible for anyone to \u201cspend\u201d those coins.\n\n\u201cI always find it strange to see how people react as if 50 bitcoin in the genesis block mattered,\u201d Dr. Wright wrote in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe so-called lost bitcoin from the genesis block do not exist as spendable bitcoin; it is an anchor. The problem people have when they look through glasses tainted with greed is that they don\u2019t see the simple facts, but rather paint the scenario with one of their desire. The first thing to remember is that there were no bitcoin sales in January 2009. Bitcoin was a system that cost money to run and create, and yet had no value. When asked about the lost value of the genesis block, the calculation is simple: 50 bitcoin times zero.\u201d\n\nChancellor is still on the brink\n\n\u201cChancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d was the Times headline. Satoshi hid in the first block\u2019s coinbase hash as a timestamp to prove there had been no mining on the Bitcoin network before he released the software to the public.\n\n\u201cThe Chancellor will decide within weeks whether to pump billions more into the economy,\u201d the original article in the Times said. In 2009 these seemed like desperate measures, and they were. Since 2009, though, governments across the Western world have indeed pumped billions, even trillions more, into their economies. Satoshi was making a statement on irresponsible government interventions in the economy and their eventual erosion on markets.\n\n\u201cThey actively sought to incentivise bad behaviour and push in typical Keynesian style the problem down the road. It would be a bigger problem, but it would be someone else\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nWell, now it\u2019s 2023, and it has indeed become someone else\u2019s problem: Ours. Western economies are currently struggling with high inflation, unemployment, and even food and energy shortages as they lurch from one crisis to another.\n\nTo give some idea of the tumultuous economic times we live in: The U.K.\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the Genesis Block was Alistair Darling, who held the office for just short of three years. In the decade following Darling\u2019s tenure, three other men held the job. However, in 2022 alone, there were four different Chancellors\u2014and three of those were in the second half of the year.\n\nIf Satoshi\u2019s hidden message in the Genesis Block was a call for less intervention and more honesty in the monetary system, we\u2019re sorry to say that only Bitcoin still stands as a representation of that honesty.\n\nEven Bitcoin became corrupted in the years following 2009, with BTC and the Core developers (along with most exchanges) still \u201cpassing off\u201d BTC as the real Bitcoin. It\u2019s not. And despite years of thefts and scams in the digital asset world, proponents still argue a form of the old \u201ccode is law\u201d cliche.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, a.k.a. Craig Wright, is still battling that corruption today. Only BSV still follows the original Bitcoin protocol rules as they existed in 2009, and hopefully, someday, the wider world will recognize it as such. Code-law is increasingly taking a back seat to human law also, and Dr. Wright is currently arguing in the courts to implement proper procedures (in both code and law) for asset recovery.\n\nHis success there would offer Bitcoiners protection against large-scale scams and thefts, at least. If you can prove you own the coins to a judge, they could and should be yours again, no matter who holds the keys.\n\nJust like the economy at large, Bitcoin is a long-term struggle against the worse aspects of human nature. In 14 years, it hasn\u2019t eliminated dishonesty and bad decisions, and it probably won\u2019t\u2014but it does offer the world a better alternative to the systems we currently have.\n\nWatch: Dr. Craig Wright on TEDx Talks\u2014Decentralisation\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

It also contains an old newspaper headline from The London Times, which reads \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\" This was thought to be a statement about the state of money in general at the time, with banks being bailed out due to irresponsible banking practices.\n\nIt has been speculated that Satoshi used this header to signal opposition to the way big banks ran things before cryptocurrencies came into existence, and how something like Bitcoin could make those same banks redundant by providing decentralized solutions for financially managing transactions.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain itself has changed drastically since its humble beginnings 10 years ago, with the total number of blocks reaching 770,111.

        "content": "Prevailing Crypto Winter Wipes Over 70,000 Bitcoin Millionaires During Entire 2022\n\nThe world of Bitcoin (BTC) has produced several millionaire success stories, as early adopters of the cryptocurrency have seen their investments pay off significantly. However, the recent volatility experienced by Bitcoin has resulted in millionaire holders suffering significant losses.\n\nIn particular, according to data acquired and calculated by Finbold as of January 2, 2023, the number of Bitcoin millionaire addresses stood at 28,007, representing a drop of about 71.73% or 71,085 addresses from January 2, 2022. At the start of last year, the number of millionaire addresses stood at 99,092.\n\nElsewhere, in January 2022, the number of addresses holding $1 million worth of Bitcoin stood at 90,902 to record, a year-over-year (YoY) drop of 73.33% to 24,208 in the first month of 2023. At the same time, addresses with at least $10 million worth of Bitcoin stood at 8,190 in January 2022 before plunging by 62.5% to 3,799 in January 2023.\n\nNotably, most Bitcoin addresses hold between $100 and $999 worth of BTC at 13.47 million as of January 2023, representing a drop of about 13.33% YoY from 15.63 million. The second largest group of Bitcoin holders accounts for at least $1,000 worth of BTC at 5.33 million as of January 2023, while in 2022, the figure stood at 6.54 million.\n\nBear market wipes out Bitcoin millionaires\n\nThe research report identified some of the contributing factors to the drop in the number of Bitcoin millionaire holders. According to the research report:\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to fall, many investors have seen their holdings significantly devalue. Therefore, the drop in millionaire addresses highlights how far the crypto market has fallen from the 2021 bull run. The slump correlates with the asset's volatility which has been a highlight of 2022, plagued by a combination of several factors such as regulatory scrutiny, turbulent markets, macroeconomic factors, and fraud-related incidents like the FTX crypto exchange crash and the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem crash.\u201d\n\nIndeed, commentators believe Bitcoin can recover as the crypto market undergoes an extended phase of volatility. At the same time, there is skepticism that the market will reclaim the previous highs.\n\nRead the full story with statistics here: https://finbold.com/bitcoin-millionaires-2022/"

(Think Starbucks Rewards, Delta SkyMiles, or Amazon Prime.)\n\nPremium members who connected their MetaMask digital wallets prior to January 1 received a valuable airdrop of BMJ tokens, sent directly to their wallet address. Going forward, Premium members will receive BMJ tokens on the 1st of every month.\n\nI\u2019ll describe what we\u2019ve built, and why it is so revolutionary.\n\nThe Problem: Getting Started with Crypto\n\nRemember our mission: to welcome the next 100 million people into crypto investing. (It\u2019s at the top of every newsletter.)\n\nOur approach is a long-term, buy and hold strategy in quality crypto assets (read more here). We\u2019re not about chasing fads or short-term trading: we\u2019re about helping our readers build long-term wealth as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nFor five years, we\u2019ve been talking with our community members, at our in-person events and Zoom workshops. What we\u2019ve learned from listening to you is that the hardest part of crypto investing is just getting started.\n\nIn other words, once people get started with our monthly investment strategy, it has worked: our average reader has built over $200,000 in crypto assets. But too many people are sitting on the sidelines, still waiting to get started.\n\nWhen we created our Premium membership in 2021, we designed it as a great \u201cpush\u201d to overcome the inertia and get you started on your investing journey. With unlimited access to our in-depth research, reports, and workshops, it has worked: hundreds of happy Premium members are now onboarded to crypto.\n\nBut there is still so much potential in the millions of investors who haven\u2019t discovered crypto. We believe \u2013 we know \u2013 that successful investing is a long-term game, and we wanted a way to make it stick.\n\nEnter the BMJ Member Rewards Token.\n\nThe BMJ Member Rewards Token is a game-changer for the industry, because it requires you to create a digital wallet to receive them. It is the easiest on-ramp to crypto in the world.\n\nReward Tokens: A Blockchain No-Brainer\n\nWith so many blockchain-based tokens created over the last five years, it is mind-blowing that tokens are still not commonly used for member rewards, which are a no-brainer for blockchain.\n\nThink about it: Why aren\u2019t your United MileagePlus points on blockchain? Or your Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods rewards points? Or your CVS ExtraCare points, which are instead printed on a receipt the length of the Magna Carta?\n\nWe believe there is room for something new.\n\nBuilding reward programs on blockchain gives members additional benefits beyond the usual \u201cbuy 10 coffees, get 1 free\u201d:\n\nInteroperability : Blockchain reward tokens can be opened up to a wide variety of companies, greatly increasing their benefits and reach. (Imagine using your Marriott rewards for third-party experiences like concerts and cruises.)\n\n: Blockchain reward tokens can be opened up to a wide variety of companies, greatly increasing their benefits and reach. (Imagine using your Marriott rewards for third-party experiences like concerts and cruises.) Exchangeability : Reward points can be bought, sold, and transferred among participants, creating a secondary market where smaller balances can be cashed out, while larger participants can buy their way to bigger rewards levels. (Imagine buying those last 500 frequent flyer points on the open market to earn a free flight.)\n\n: Reward points can be bought, sold, and transferred among participants, creating a secondary market where smaller balances can be cashed out, while larger participants can buy their way to bigger rewards levels. (Imagine buying those last 500 frequent flyer points on the open market to earn a free flight.) Transparency: Reward participants can have a complete accounting of how many reward points are in circulation at any time, while companies can watch reward points behavior and flow between users, identifying their most engaged customers. (Imagine seeing how many Starbucks Rewards are in circulation.)\n\nWe want to do for reward programs what cryptocurrency has done for money. In short, we want to set reward programs free.\n\nOur Premium (paid) members are the first to experience this vision: you\u2019ll receive monthly reward tokens that can be stored in your MetaMask digital wallet and redeemed for real-life rewards (see the current list here).\n\nOur Vision for Reward Tokens\n\nToday\u2019s reward programs are tightly controlled and centralized: after all, there\u2019s a real monetary cost to paying out rewards. (Free flights still cost money.)\n\nFor this reason, reward program rules often change, usually to the annoyance of customers who were saving up for that 50,000-mile bonus that\u2019s now only available on Tuesdays in May, after a $100 processing fee. (No wonder they\u2019re sometimes called frequent liar programs.)\n\nA blockchain-based reward token disrupts these legacy programs as radically as the open-source movement disrupted programming.\n\nCompanies now issue the tokens, but they do not own them.\n\nInstead, users own them, and can buy, sell, trade, collect, and redeem them like traditional money.\n\nWhat companies lose in control, they more than gain in growing their reward ecosystem.\n\nWe envision reward systems that add incredible value to their users, allowing collaboration between complementary (or even competing) brands, and building a flywheel of mutual growth.\n\nImagine if BMJ tokens were not limited to our rewards, but could be redeemed for Spotify subscriptions, Life is Good T-shirts, or a Netflix streaming membership. These partner companies could easily accept our BMJ Member Rewards Token, and write it off as a marketing expense: the cost to acquire a new customer (a high-income customer with $200K in crypto, no less).\n\nThat\u2019s the vision for tomorrow; here\u2019s how the program works today.\n\nHow the Program Works\n\nAnyone can sign up for our free newsletter, which is delivered 3x/week.\n\nWhen they\u2019re ready to \u201clevel up,\u201d subscribers join our Premium program, which gets them a daily newsletter, plus a huge on-demand library of crypto investing content.\n\nPremium members then have the option of connecting their MetaMask wallet to the site (watch the video).\n\nWith a connected wallet, they begin to accrue 10 BMJ tokens, on the 1st of every month.\n\nThese tokens are ERC-20 compliant, and will be minted directly to Ethereum (we pay the gas fee)!\n\nThese tokens can be \u201credeemed\u201d (i.e., burned) for real-world rewards like T-shirts, NFTs, exclusive events, and more. As tokens are redeemed, they are burned .\n\n. Click here to see the current list of Member Rewards.\n\nWe\u2019ll be talking all this week about the journey to bring this token to life. You\u2019ll learn how to tell how much money we\u2019re making, why we chose Ethereum (not a Layer 2 solution), and why we predict this will kick off the next great wave of crypto growth.\n\nStay tuned \u2013 I promise it\u2019s going to be rewarding.\n\nContinue on to Part 2 in this series: How to Earn and Burn BMJ Reward Tokens >>"

        "title": "Happy Genesis Block Day! - Kraken Blog Kraken Blog - Kraken Blog",
        "content": "On January 3, 2009, the anonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, launched the Genesis Block \u2013 the first block in the Bitcoin Blockchain. The event at the time wasn\u2019t celebrated \u2013 it was arguably considered a blip in the long history of cryptography and digital currency \u2013 but today we know the Genesis Block was one of the most important things to happen in the history of cryptocurrency.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what the Genesis Block was and why it was important \u2013 even vital \u2013 to the growth of cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is a genesis block?\n\nA blockchain ledger can be thought of as a digital chain of boxes, where each box contains a set amount of data. Part of that data includes a reference to the previous block, which, in turn, contains information about the block before it and so on. This data can be followed all the way back to a blockchain\u2019s very first block \u2014 known as the genesis block.\n\nA genesis block lays the foundation for a new blockchain and possesses a number of unique traits that no other block in its chain has.\n\nWith regards to bitcoin\u2019s genesis block, its creation marked the beginning of a new financial revolution and ushered in the era of decentralized digital money.\n\nWhat\u2019s special about a genesis block?\n\nWhen a new blockchain is created, it\u2019s important that all network participants \u2014 known as nodes \u2014 acknowledge the same block as being the genesis block and synchronize from the same point. To ensure this, genesis blocks are directly embedded into their respective protocol\u2019s source code. No other block is permanently recorded in this way.\n\nGenesis blocks are also the only blocks that do not reference a previous block of transactions. For all other blocks, they contain a hash value of the previous block. In the case of genesis blocks, this value is always zero.\n\nCrypto tokens such as Tether, Chainlink and Uniswap do not have genesis blocks. This is because, unlike crypto coins, crypto tokens are built on top of a non-native blockchain like Ethereum, Solana or Binance Smart Chain.\n\nThe bitcoin genesis block\n\nThe bitcoin genesis block is famous for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it\u2019s hailed as being the first cryptocurrency block ever created on a globally viable, proof-of-work powered blockchain. This landmark moment paved the way for the creation of the disruptive digital asset industry we have today.\n\nThat being said though, just like its mysterious creator(s), bitcoin\u2019s early beginnings are also deeply shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the original Bitcoin source code distributed in 2008, Bitcoin\u2019s creator(s) Satoshi Nakamoto referenced the hash of the bitcoin genesis block as being,\n\n\n\n\u201c0x000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\u201d\n\nCryptographer Ray Dillinger, a.k.a Cryddit, was one of the first to receive the original Bitcoin source code. They noted the genesis block hash in the early source code was different to the bitcoin genesis block hash produced when Nakamoto launched the protocol on Jan. 3, 2009 \u2014several months later.\n\nThe subsequent bitcoin genesis block hash turned out to be:\n\n000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\n\nThe two values are almost identical, apart from the second character. Some have suggested this might point to an earlier bitcoin blockchain that Nakamoto may have created for \u201ctesting purposes\u201d but never continued. However, like Nakamoto\u2019s true identity, the existence of this potentially earlier bitcoin blockchain remains unclear.\n\nHow much BTC was minted in the bitcoin genesis block?\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto mined the official bitcoin genesis block in 2009, 50 BTC were created for the first time and sent to the wallet address: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.\n\nTo this day, those first coins have never been moved from that wallet, though the address has received a further 18.5 BTC from more than 3,600 wallets. These payments may be tributary contributions from loyal bitcoin supporters or simply accidental transactions. These transactions might be considered digital graffiti \u2013 a sort of \u201cI was here\u201d made by bitcoin adherents.\n\nAfter the genesis block was created, it took a further six days before Nakamoto mined the second bitcoin block. Again, it\u2019s not known why it took so long for the second block to be mined, but some believe it was a nod to the Bible\u2019s seven days of creation.\n\nWho owns the first bitcoin block reward?\n\nWhen a new block is mined, the first transaction recorded in that block is known as a coinbase transaction. This references the new amount of native cryptocurrency that gets created after the mining process and released into circulation as a block reward.\n\nThe coinbase transaction of the bitcoin genesis block, however, was omitted from the global transaction database by Nakamoto, meaning that the amount could never be spent. It\u2019s still unknown whether this was intentional or accidental on Nakamoto\u2019s part.\n\nDespite the vast amount of uncertainty surrounding bitcoin\u2019s genesis block, its creation remains one of the most important moments in history, not just for cryptography but for global financial freedom and self-sovereignty.\n\nThese materials are for general information purposes only and are not investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell, or hold any digital asset or to engage in any specific trading strategy.

        "content": "People across the world are celebrating the birthday of Bitcoin. Today, Bitcoin officially turns 14 years old. What is a Bitcoin Birthday and who\u2019s celebrating it? In this article, we go over a quick brief on Bitcoin and its start which marks a Bitcoin Birthday.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBy now, everyone is aware of Bitcoin. However, it\u2019s critical to draw attention to Bitcoin\u2019s key features. Decentralization is the core concept of Bitcoin, which enables peer-to-peer transactions without the use of middlemen like banks. This indicates that transactions can be carried out directly between users without the assistance of a third party for verification or facilitation.\n\nIn a world where privacy is a growing concern, Bitcoin is able to return privacy controls over to consumers.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Birthday?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) celebrated its 14th birthday on January 3rd, 2023. Bitcoin was created on January 3, 2009, when the genesis block was generated.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Genesis Block?\n\nThe first block ever mined for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is known as a \u201cGenesis Block.\u201d A blockchain is made up of several so-called blocks used to store data on transactions that take place on a blockchain network. Each block has a distinct header, and the block header hash is used to uniquely identify each such block.\n\nWho celebrated the Bitcoin Birthday?\n\nNaturally, Bitcoin hodlers and admirers wished Bitcoin a happy birthday. Crypto companies and exchanges also announced their Bitcoin wishes, as they wished for a long-term growth.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/princesolee1/status/1610279684679294982\n\nhttps://twitter.com/binance/status/1610266061638717442\n\nWhere will Bitcoin reach in 2023?\n\nIf Bitcoin continues to crash towards the low of around 12K, Bitcoin might reverse from that price higher. Looking back at how Bitcoin recovered, we can see that BTC prices jumped from $10,000 to $60,000 within 6 months. This assumption suggests that Q3 of 2023 should confirm the end of the downtrend and open a renewed bull crypto market. By then, Bitcoin can at least reach around 70% of its previous ATH.\n\nOffer from CryptoTicker\n\nAre you looking for a chart analysis tool that doesn\u2019t distract you with community messages and other noise?

        "content": "Luke Dashjr, one of the core developers of the world's first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reported a loss of over 200 coins in a recent hack on December 31, 2022, ahead of the new year. According to Dashjr, his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key was compromised that led to the theft of most of his coins. On January 1 this year, he posted on Twitter that a hacker had allegedly accessed his PGP key to carry out the theft. PGP is a common security method that is used to access encrypted information. He shared a few of the wallet addresses where some of his stolen Bitcoins were transferred. However, he has not revealed the total amount of BTC stolen from his wallet.\n\nIn a tweet, he said he had \"no idea how\" his coins were stolen and that he needed help.\n\nPSA: My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help please. #Bitcoin \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) January 1, 2023\n\nThe wallet address that he tweeted about displayed details about four transactions between 2:08 and 2:16 PM UTC on December 31.

If buyers are able to sustain their efforts, it is possible that the price of Bitcoin will rise above $16,700 by this week.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, \u201cSolana saw a rebound from its recent low value of $8.19 and returned to the $9.50 price range. However, having experienced a drop of 96 percent, in order to recover, SOL may need to distance itself from Bankman-Fried, who invested significantly in the cryptocurrency and provided support to Solana projects through venture deals with FTX and market-making from Alameda Research. Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading around $16,500$ & $1,200, respectively, with no major change.\u201d\n\nweTrade founder Prashant Kumar offered his take on the market scenario as well, \"The global cryptocurrency market started the new year largely flat with the global market cap under $800 billion. The two key currencies \u2014 Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 have seen some gains in the past day and are in the green. Cardano, Polkadot saw gains of approximately 1.5 percent. Meanwhile, XRP saw a decline of 3.3 percent over the last 24 hours. 2022 saw lots of downward movement in cryptocurrency prices, investors are hoping for good news from the market this year.\u201d\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, \u201cThe largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin entered 2023 on a positive note as it witnessed a jump of 0.39 percent in its value. The largest altcoin Ether also registered a jump of 0.29 percent to start the new year in green. It will be interesting to see the moves of the central banks around the globe to tackle inflation which will chart the course for financial markets. Markets will remain on the edge due to the evolving covid situation in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nThe Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) price currently stands at US$16,699 (AU$24,454).\n\nThat's right about where BTC kicked off the new year three days ago.\n\nBut it's some 65% lower than the US$47,170 the world's first and still top crypto commanded on 1 January 2022.\n\nAdding in the selling action in the final seven weeks of 2021, the Bitcoin price closed 2022 down 76% from its all-time 10 November 2021 highs, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nHere's what went wrong for the leading digital token in the year gone by.\n\nBitcoin price hit by multiple headwinds\n\nOn a macroeconomic level, the Bitcoin price was hammered by the same forces which saw tech shares take a beating last year.\n\nNamely, fast-rising interest rates instituted by almost every leading central bank the world over.\n\nThe rapid increase in the cost of money saw the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index finish the year down a painful 34%. Here on the ASX, the S&P/ASX All Technology Index (ASX: XTX) fell a similar amount.\n\nIf nothing else, 2022 showed that the Bitcoin price is closely linked to the performance of growth stocks. And highly susceptible to the impacts of rising interest rates.\n\nThe crypto world was also rocked by a number of massive meltdowns in 2022.\n\nFirst, there was the implosion of TerraUSD (CRYPTO: UST) in May. The so-called stablecoin was intended to be pegged to the US dollar. But a liquidity crunch saw crypto investors rush to sell their holdings, driving the token to mere pennies on the dollar.\n\nJittery investors sold off most cryptos over the following weeks, and the Bitcoin price was not spared.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, November saw the collapse of global crypto exchange FTX.com.\n\nCo-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX was one of the top five crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nBut in another instance of liquidity evaporating, FTX went belly up almost overnight and Bankman-Fried is now facing a potentially lengthy jail term in the United States.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the FTX collapse, the Bitcoin price fell to more than two-year lows of US$15,599.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAs for what crypto investors might expect in the year ahead for the Bitcoin price, much of that will hinge on interest rates.\n\nShould the US Federal Reserve and other leading global central banks begin to ease off on their aggressive tightening paths, it should throw up some welcome tailwinds for tech stocks and crypto assets alike."

        "title": "Prevailing crypto winter wipes over 70,000 Bitcoin millionaires during entire 2022 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The rise of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in recent years has created a new class of wealthy individuals, many of whom had made their fortunes by buying into the market early and adopting \u2018HODLing\u2018 strategies. However, the past year has seen the market experience a sharp downturn, with the value of Bitcoin falling significantly, resulting in a devastating impact on the wealth of many holders.\n\nIn particular, according to data acquired and calculated by Finbold, as of January 2, 2023, the number of Bitcoin millionaire addresses stood at 28,007, representing a drop of about 71.73% or 71,085 addresses from January 2, 2022. At the start of last year, the number of millionaire addresses stood at 99,092.\n\nElsewhere, in January 2022, the number of addresses holding $1 million worth of Bitcoin stood at 90,902 to record, a year-over-year (YoY) drop of 73.33% to 24,208 in the first month of 2023. At the same time, addresses with at least $10 million worth of Bitcoin stood at 8,190 in January 2022 before plunging by 62.5% to 3,799 in January 2023. Notably, most Bitcoin addresses hold between $100 and $999 worth of BTC at 13.47 million in January 2023.\n\nBear market wipes out Bitcoin millionaires\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to fall, many investors have seen their holdings significantly devalue. Therefore, the drop in millionaire addresses highlights how far the crypto market has fallen from the 2021 bull run. The slump correlates with the asset\u2019s volatility which has been a highlight of 2022, plagued by a combination of several factors such as regulatory scrutiny, turbulent markets, macroeconomic factors, and fraud-related incidents like the FTX crypto exchange crash and the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem crash.\n\nOverall, the condition has resulted in many investors and speculators becoming wary of the market, leading to decreased demand for cryptocurrencies. This has had a cascading effect on the market, with the value of cryptocurrencies showing minimal signs of rallying.\n\nIt is worth noting that the declining number of Bitcoin millionaires is not solely an impact of the plunging prices. With Bitcoin undergoing a free fall in recent weeks, the likelihood of holders liquating their assets increased to avoid further losses. Institutions have also jumped on the liquidation bandwagon, with American business intelligence firm MicroStrategy selling over 700 Bitcoin. The development was considered a surprise, considering the firm had maintained never to sell the asset. However, the company cited tax reasons for the sale.\n\nThe crypto playing field differences\n\nInterestingly, the emergence of Bitcoin millionaires has also questioned the role of cryptocurrencies in leveling the financial playing field. Although the anonymous nature of digital assets makes it challenging to identify the exact millionaire holders, some wealthy people are known to control crypto-related businesses. Notably, as millionaires see a drop in wealth, they are in a considerably better financial position than small net-worth traders. In this case, some smallholders betted on the sector with their life savings.\n\nIn this line, amid the bear market, such businesses have been forced to scale down operations by initiating measures like employee layoffs and rolling out hiring freezes. Consequently, executives have remained unscathed as the employees lose their jobs and traders see their investments get wiped off.\n\nFurthermore, the divide between the minority millionaire investors and the majority ordinary holder has partly contributed to a push for enacting regulations. Overall, it is highly speculated that the rollout of rules will impact the price of Bitcoin and, consequently, the net worth of holders.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next move\n\nDue to the increasing uncertainty around the stability of global markets, commentators agree that the price of risk assets like Bitcoin could continue to suffer over a longer time frame. Despite the current crypto winter, there is still hope for those who remain in the market.\n\nSome analysts and investors are optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency, betting on the value of Bitcoin to rise backed by factors like a slowdown in Federal Reserve monetary policy, falling inflation, and a possible rally from the upcoming halving event slated for 2024.\n\nIn addition, the increasing institutionalization of the market and a growing number of sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) projects could drive further growth in the future. It remains to be seen whether the crypto winter will end soon or continue to plague the market for some time.\n\nIn general, crypto fanatics maintain that the bear market is a regular occurrence and a majority believe the ongoing impacts are temporary. However, for long-term believers in Bitcoin, the falling prices have offered an opportunity to accumulate the asset, hoping to benefit from a possible rally."

        "content": "Forward-looking: To say 2022 was a rough time for crypto is an understatement. Following a long period of rising prices and delighted investors, last year saw the arrival of a crypto winter that brought Bitcoin's price crashing down, bankrupted companies, and wiped over $1 trillion off the market, and that's not even mentioning the collapse of FTX. But what will 2023 bring? Analysts' predictions vary wildly, from Bitcoin almost quadrupling its previous record high and reaching $250,000, to the digital coin crashing to $5,000, which would be its lowest price since 2019.\n\nBitcoin started 2022 at close to $48,000. That's down from its highest-ever price of almost $68,000 a few months earlier, but it was still welcome news for those who invested a few years prior when BTC was under $10,000.\n\nHowever, the last 12 months have been some of crypto's worst. The collapse of stablecoin TerraUSD and its support coin Luna crushed the industry in May. It led to huge crypto businesses such as Celsius going bankrupt and the market dipping below $1 trillion as the price of Bitcoin and other digital assets crashed. Then came the FTX controversy, which has seen the arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried and lawsuits against celebrities who promoted the company in TV ads.\n\nBitcoin has been hovering between $16,000 and $17,000 since mid-December. But how will the world's most popular crypto fare in 2023? CNBC round up some predictions from analysts, investors, and others within the industry.\n\nBitcoin's price over the last five years. Will it go up or down in 2023?\n\nThe most optimistic call comes from billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper. He believes Bitcoin will rally 1,400% to end the year worth $250,000. \"My assumption is that since women control 80% of retail spending, and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women that the dam is about to break,\" Draper told CNBC. He expects things to get even better in 2024 when the halving---an event that occurs every four years in which the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half---takes place.\n\nOn the opposite end of the scale is Standard Chartered's global head of research, Eric Robertsen, who believes Bitcoin's fall will continue to $5,000 next year, a drop of about 70% from its current price. Veteran investor Mark Mobius has a similarly pessimistic outlook, believing BTC will drop to $10,000 in 2023.\n\nCarol Alexander, a professor of finance at Sussex University, has better news for holders. She believes BTC will reach $30,000 in the first quarter, climbing to $50,000 in quarters three or four, thanks to whales who hold large amounts of Bitcoin stepping in to help the market.\n\nUltimately, of course, accurately predicting Bitcoin's future price is impossible. Whether the market recovers or plunges even further in 2023 is anyone's guess."

        "content": "A Bitcoin core developer has had his server hacked after his security key was compromised. The hacker has supposedly stolen over 200 BTC, worth around 3.3 million dollars.\n\nLuke Dashjr, a developer who works on Bitcoin Core, the technology and security behind the cryptocurrency, has lost over 200 Bitcoins in an apparent hack.\n\nAccording to Dashjr\u2019s Twitter, the PGP key (Pretty Good Privacy) was compromised and allowed the hacker to loot his Bitcoin from the computer they were being stored on.\n\nA PGP key is an encryption method that utilizes two different keys to lock away information. Dashjr has identified the Bitcoin wallets that some of the money was sent to, but as of yesterday, claims it has all gone.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nDashjr had been targeted in an attempted smash-and-grab on his Bitcoin stash earlier in the year but brushed it off after investigating. On his Mastodon, Dashjr stated he had \u201cpurged the backdoors\u201d implemented in the attack, but couldn\u2019t find any evidence of it being used.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nDashjr also deleted a tweet in regards to his \u201ccold wallet\u201d. This is a type of Bitcoin wallet that is kept offline to ensure maximum security. Dashjr questioned whether or not it was \u201cMaybe not as cold as intended?\u201d\n\nAccording to another developer, Peter Todd, Dashjr\u2019s active PC runs a Linux distro called Gentoo. This was also where he stored his \u201chot\u201d Bitcoin wallet. A hot wallet is one that is actively connected to the internet and can be accessed at any time.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIf a compromised piece of software made it on, as Dashjr suspects, then it was an inevitability of it getting stolen and not a targeted attack.\n\nEven the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, stated on Twitter that \u201cSelf-custody [has] a different set of risks\u201d.\n\nSuspicions around the lost Bitcoin\n\nIn response to his loss, user beeforbacon1 called it a \u201cTop tier boating accident.\u201d This in-joke alludes to claiming your cash was lost in a boating accident to avoid paying tax on it.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nOn Reddit, the hack has been discussed in detail, including some of the participants alluding to this being part of Dashjr\u2019s habit of being a \u201cserial grifter\u201d.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIn 2017, a fundraiser was set up to collect money for Dashjr\u2019s house. People pointed out that with his amount of Bitcoin \u2013 at the time in 2017 it was at a peak of $19,511 per BTC \u2013 he would have insurance and be able to cover the costs himself.\n\nAt the time, another user monitored the wallet activity and saw the 3.5 BTC sent for upgrading the internet access to the house \u2013 a stretch goal \u2013 never left the wallet.\n\nOthers on Reddit have pointed out that this happening close to the tax season in the US is suspicious."
