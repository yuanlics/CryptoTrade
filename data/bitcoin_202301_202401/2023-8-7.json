        "content": "The government began its big push for Bitcoin adoption two years ago, yet adoption is still clearly in its infancy here. Most workers still prefer cash, and the latency associated with bitcoin settlement times make the currency somewhat cumbersome, at least at present. Some of the vendors I\u2019ve encountered so far have layer 2 Lightning integrations, but it is not common. Most people I\u2019ve spoken to so far do not have a deep understanding of how the digital commodity is backed."

        "title": "Bitcoin Isn't Going Away, Says David Rubenstein - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nThis is perfectly timed because Novogratz has been the pinata of Bitcoin when it goes down. It's been the genius of Bitcoin when it goes up and all of a sudden Larry showed up at the door to say, Hey, big, respectable firms can prosecute and do Bitcoin. Link Lawrence Fink of BlackRock to Mike Novogratz. Well, what's happened is people, as you suggest, make fun of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But now the establishment of Larry Fink at BlackRock is now saying they're going to have an ETF if approved by the government in Bitcoin. So you're saying, wait a second, the mighty BlackRock is willing to have an ETF in Bitcoin. Maybe Bitcoin is going to be around for a while. Lisa wants to jump in here, but I'm going to cut to the news moment. Is Carlyle announcing this morning a Bitcoin advocacy? No, I don't think so. But there's no doubt that Bitcoin is something that I wish I had bought it at $100 a bitcoin when Mike Novogratz started buying, it's now at $29,000. So he's made a lot of money and a lot of people who bought it at $100 or less are feeling pretty good now. It went up as high as 61,000, I think even down to 31,000 or even 29,000. Now, there's still a pretty good profit if you're bought in 100. We all wish we would have bought it at 100 and to write it up. It's one thing for BlackRock to come up with an ETF because they believe the proposition of Bitcoin. It's another because they see a profitability proposition where they can, you know, basically take advantage of the interest other people have. I mean, isn't that more of what this is that basically Wall Street is saying if there is a market for it and we can viably make one for them and make some money, why not? Well, remember, Wall Street is in business to make money and this is something they can probably make money off. You have to remember, the United States government has been somewhat skeptical of it. I think Democrats in the Congress and particularly the people regulating the FCC are skeptical of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But outside the United States, there's a lot of interest in it. I think FCX really hurt when it went bankrupt and it hurt the the crypto industry. But a lot of people around the world want to be able to trade in a currency that their government can't know what they have and they want to be at a moving around, rightly or wrongly. And so I don't think Bitcoin is going away. I think the Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pretty supportive of it. There's a difference between having a seamless cross-currency payment, basically saying that instead of going to Western Union, I can go and just transfer something in Bitcoin if it has a stable enough price. That's one proposition. But the proposition of Bitcoin as a store of value, that could kind of be bid up the way that gold or silver could seems to have been sparked with the advent of yield suddenly that you can get for actual money. I mean, isn't that sort of the feeling that you're getting? Well, there's no doubt that when when interest rates are as high as they are, you don't need to have gold or other kinds of things to get you some solid return, because when you get 5% on Treasuries, but eventually 5% will be coming down at some point. I don't think Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies that are the better ones, the better known ones, Bitcoin. And so a number of others are going to go away. There's enormous interest around the world in being able to have something you can transfer without the government knowing about it and keep it private. And you know, you can say, well, people shouldn't do that, but that's not going to stop people from doing it. Mr. Novogratz And Mr. Gensler, what did he say about the efforts of our chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who's the chairman of the SEC, is not a big fan of cryptocurrencies. I think that's fair to say. But he lost a major case recently in court where he was trying to argue that one of the cryptocurrencies ripple was was a security and he lost that case. So I think the SEC has not been able to convince these the government yet, or at least the courts that cryptocurrency is such a dangerous thing. And I remember a lot of people in the government now are thinking that Gary Gensler won't be the chairman of the SEC for ever going to go. I mean, these guys just wait them out, right? I think that's a strategy that's very popular in Washington, waiting out regulators who don't like."

        "title": "The deadline for a ruling on Ark's application for a bitcoin ETF is near - CNBC",
        "content": "Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nIt's put up or shut up time for the SEC on a bitcoin ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission is required to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to ARK's application for a bitcoin ETF by Aug. 13. Eight other organizations, including BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and WisdomTree, have also filed applications for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nYes, no or punt?\n\nArk's application for a spot bitcoin ETF was published in the Federal Register on May 15. A June 15 filing in the Federal Register from the SEC designated Aug. 13 \"as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.\" However, the SEC can extend the deadline to a maximum of 240 days. At its maximum, the SEC could theoretically delay a final response until Jan. 10, 2024 for the Ark application, and until March 2024 for the others, according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which has an application in front of the SEC. Get in line: Bitcoin ETF applications\n\n(Date filed & Last possible review) Ark/21 Shares Bitcoin Trust 5/15/23 1/10/24\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust 7/18/23 3/15/24\n\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF Trust 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust 7/19/23 3/16/24 A ninth organization, Grayscale, has filed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a Bitcoin Spot ETF. Approvals would be simultaneous Given the \"first mover\" advantage would be tremendous, many are now arguing that if a bitcoin ETF is ultimately approved by the SEC, all the applications should be approved at once. That's exactly what Grayscale said in a recent letter to the SEC. \"[T]he SEC's actions related to bitcoin ETFs should be made in a fair and orderly manner.\" the letter said. \"As a disclosure-based regulator, the SEC should not pick winners and losers.\"\n\n'Surveillance sharing agreement'\n\nThe SEC has denied all prior spot bitcoin ETF applications, citing fraud and manipulation in the underlying markets. It has approved bitcoin ETF futures. The current crop of applications have a new wrinkle: a \"surveillance sharing\" agreement with exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe.\n\nwatch now\n\nThis would allow for the sharing of information about market trading activity, clearing activity, and customer identification, which would reduce the chances for market manipulation. It would also seek to ensure that investor assets cannot be diverted by the exchange to an unauthorized party, which was an issue with FTX. It's not clear if these changes would be sufficient to cause the SEC to approve a spot bitcoin ETF. The SEC has reportedly said the new applications were inadequate, and exchanges have been scrambling to update their filings to address the SEC's concerns.\n\nForcing the SEC's hand\n\nMany believe that the SEC will not move unless it is forced to do so. Supporters of a spot bitcoin ETF have been emboldened by a court case unfolding between Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the SEC. Grayscale has sued the SEC over its refusal to allow the trust to convert to a bitcoin ETF. The SEC cited familiar concerns over market manipulation. During hearings on the case in March, a panel of judges in the D.C. Court of Appeals in Washington pressed the SEC on why it had denied the application, noting that the commission had previously approved bitcoin futures agreements which also had surveillance agreements in them. \"It seems like it's fine for an agency to say OK, we need some more information, but it seems there's quite a bit of information here on how these markets work together, and the SEC has not offered any explanation ... that the petitioners here are wrong,\" Judge Neomi Rao said. Bitcoin supporters have been cheering Graycale's efforts. \"They're forcing the SEC through a legal process, to provide clarity,\" Purpose Investments CEO Som Seif told me. Seif runs the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, a spot bitcoin ETF that has been trading in Canada since February, 2021. \"I think that that's a really important thing, because through the regulatory and legal process, they will be forced to actually give very specific reasons and actually back those reasons... [SEC Chairman Gary Gensler] is going to keep kicking the can down the road until he's otherwise forced to say, 'Here's why.'\"\n\nGaming the odds\n\nWhile many in the crypto community are putting on a game face, others are doubtful, noting that Gensler seems implacably opposed to approving a spot bitcoin ETF. \"We're not going to see a spot bitcoin ETF any time soon,\" Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professional (DACFP), told CNBC at a recent conference. \"We would love a bitcoin ETF,\" Edelman said. \"It's the simplest, easiest, cheapest, most liquid affordable way to invest in bitcoin. But the SEC has rejected every Bitcoin ETF application for the past 10 years.\" Others believe the environment is changing. The crypto community took note that the SEC approved a 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF (BITX) in June, and there has recently been a rush of applications for an ethereum futures ETF. Last week, Bloomberg Intelligence's James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas put the odds of a bitcoin ETF approval at 65%, noting, among other things, the SEC's poor showing in the Grayscale litigation.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "00:00\n\nYou know, you are also involved in you've got your own filing for physical physically backed Bitcoin ETF. Do you think that the excitement there has driven up prices across crypto? I mean, today is a down day, but we're still looking at $29,000 for Bitcoin. Yes, I do think that in June, when BlackRock announced its filing or when it was announced that BlackRock had filed for a Bitcoin ETF, the Bitcoin price did shoot up and but has been fairly stable since then. So I do think it's had an impact, A bigger impact this year was the regional bank crisis. It was very interesting to watch Bitcoin go from 19000 to 30000 right in the middle of that banking crisis as regional banks were going bankrupt. So it was a flight to safety. So I thought that move was just as interesting on a flight to safety. Is buying Bitcoin somehow a flight to safety? Isn't it a little too volatile for that? Well, if you think about it, Bitcoin serves as two kinds of hedges. One is a hedge against inflation and outright confiscation of wealth. The other is against counterparty risk. And I, you know, was when the regional banks started going down this fear sort of, you know, memory. Our memories are fresh with oh eight or nine. The counterparty risk became real. And so there was this flight into Bitcoin, a completely decentralized, transparent network which is not subject to counterparty risk. Kathy So you are in this race. Let's talk about the race a little bit. The first important deadline coming up is August 13th, where the Ark filing the SC is either going to delay it, which we think they'll probably delay it. And then BlackRock is later. You filed before BlackRock but BlackRock came in with the surveillance sharing agreement with Coinbase that was novel. Right now we're looking in the future there's talk of a common clock where the SCC could approve a whole bunch of ETFs at once, putting you on a level playing field with BlackRock and others. What's your take on how this will play out given you filed earlier? I think you're probably right that August 13th will come and go and I think I think the SCC, if it's going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once. So then again, because most of these essentially will be the same and it will come down to marketing, communicating the message. You know, we've been putting out our Bitcoin monthly for the for the last year. We are now starting a Bitcoin brainstorming session. Our first one we launched last Thursday. So we're trying to get the word out there that, you know, our research is deep and we've been doing it since 2015 when we gained our first exposure to BTC. We were the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin at all in 2015. That's exactly where I want to go. The grayscale Bitcoin trust known by its ticker gbtc. If you look at our W, for example, your ARK next generation Internet ETF. Right now I see GBTC as the third largest holding. If we are in a situation where the SEC does give its blessing for a spot Bitcoin ETF, would you plan to sell out of gbtc and buy one of these physically backed funds? So I cannot talk about what we would and would not do. And in fact, our compliance team is, you know, giving us marching orders not to talk very much about this filing and its aftermath at all. So just the fact that we filed with our partner 21 shares is is as far as I can go. So sorry, Katie. Fair enough. No. I was expecting something along those lines. I am curious to get your take on the regulatory temperature right now, because in addition to this rush of spot Bitcoin ETF filings that we've seen, there's also been sort of a race that's unfolding for an ETHER futures ETF. There's been a ton of filings to that effect and not specific to those funds. But do you sense that the mood, mood music around the SEC and what their appetite to allow these products to launch has changed in the last several months? Well, I think that that the two other branches of government, the judicial branch and the legislative branch are giving the FCC pause because the FCC is losing cases in court having to do with its regulations. Around crypto. That's the first thing. And there are bills that are making their way through the House and are seeing some bipartisan support. So I do believe that. Gary Gensler, I guess last week or ten days ago said something like, Well, you know, I'm not the only one who makes this decision. There are five commissioners. Now, of course, we know they're weighted towards the Democrats, two Democrats, two Republicans. And so one assumes that the way that Gary votes is the way that the FCC will vote. But he seemed to be distancing himself a little bit. And so maybe we can take that as a bit of a clue. We definitely did. We thought that was a good sign. But, you know, we're reading all kinds of tea leaves in this. Let me ask you about Coinbase, because you have increased your position in Coinbase. It's also who your surveillance sharing agreement is with. Also, how much is it? How important is it that Coinbase is a bridge or compliant enough for the SEC in terms of working with traditional finance? Is your bullishness on this stock that they are going to be sort of the traditional finance bridge or is it other you know, you think people are going to continue trading crypto on Coinbase? No actual both. We we think that it is the most regulatory compliant exchange out there and we've been very pleased with how its derivatives exchange in Bermuda has ramped in here. It's very early days, but again, clearly a trusted partner and and we are also seeing that there's more turmoil out there, I guess to be I think that's how you just say the name of the exchange and tether and finance. There are still there are rumblings out there that not is all all is well. And so coin Coinbase is going to be the flight to safety exchange, no doubt about it. And do you think this surveillance agreement with Coinbase are going to be enough to deal with things like price manipulation in this market? I mean, that's been one of the main concerns from the SEC lawyers with with whom we've spoken. Well, what I find so interesting still, and this is why we believe that the FCC will lose the grayscale case, how can you approve a Bitcoin futures ETF and and not a Bitcoin ETF? And and in fact, if you're really thinking about consumer protection, a futures ETF swaps space. So there's counterparty risk there that you would not have with a Bitcoin ETF which is backed 1 to 1 with Bitcoin in Coinbase is called storage. It still confounds me. And not to mention that the point that Eric makes, which is that if there had been an ETF, a lot of people wouldn't have bought Bitcoin at stocks and instead would use the article. Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn is stepping down after more than 13 years at Tesla. Curious to hear your reaction given how long you've been involved in the stock, how long he's been there, does this give you any pause? Well, we all loved Zack and love Zack and think he will do very well wherever he goes. I, I, I know there are rumors out that there are some CTO positions out there which he might like to take, so we will miss him. But his successor has been with Tesla right underneath him since 2018. So he was put through the fires, remember, in 2018, 19. And many, many analysts were saying that Tesla was going bankrupt, too. And so he's been there. He's gone through the fire. And, you know, it's a tough job. It's a tough, tough job. So I I guess 13 years was a really good run for Zach. And I can't say enough good things about him and what he did for Tesla, but I think he trained his successor well. That's great to hear. Do you expect Tesla to build 2 million vehicles this year? I think it's incredible how they've grown production and it looks like they can do that. What are your expectations for their growth from here on out? Well, as you know, we have a five year investment time horizon. And and we do think this cycle for autos is going to get tougher in here generally. But we think just like last year when electric vehicles were up 69% or 65%, something like that, and gas powered vehicles down 7% globally. We think we're going to continue to see that share shift accelerate because. Electric vehicle prices are going to follow the court their costs down in a way that gas powered cars cannot. So we think that electric vehicles will be less expensive and they are better cars than gas powered vehicles. So we think they're going to take tremendous share. And even if the auto market relapses in here, which we think it could, we don't think electric vehicles will relapse. So we think the 1.8 million for this year, which was Elon, said 1.8 to 2 million, they're going to have some shut downs in the third quarter for maintenance and upgrades. And so he lowered he lowered his expectation to the lower end of that range. I think he likes to lower expectations and then be. So I wouldn't be surprised if it's higher than that. BNN Bloomberg New Economy Forum has voiced concerns about the availability of cobalt and lithium, and is there enough to continue making electric cars for the masses, as some producers like GM are building, you know, massive 200 kilowatt batteries for their trucks? Is that a concern for you at all? Do you think Tesla has the production locked in? Well, I know very early on they they said to their suppliers, you know, if if you will build it, we will buy it. So, yes, they've been in a preferred position and probably still are. They're also very smart. Tesla's engineers are very smart. They are engineering cobalt out of the cars. They're doing it for a few reasons. The supply is uncertain and it's very focused in, I guess, the Congo, where there are a lot of environmental and governance and social concerns. So they're engineering it out and they're moving into. And you should on lithium, actually, if you look at the price, it went up tenfold in two years and now it's down about 40% from that peak. I think lithium is one of the most pervasive minerals out there. So we don't think lithium is an issue at all, especially now that the Chinese and the Koreans and all of the U.S. OEMs are are basically telling lithium miners, just just build it and we will take it. So and then the other interesting thing is, again, this is Tesla leading the charge, so to speak, in this category, lithium ion phosphate. So taking out the nickel and other metals that may end up in short supply, especially if we get into very strong cycles and the lithium ion iron phosphate is a much lower priced or will lead to a much lower price car as well. Cathie, real quick, I wanted to get in the superconductor. This is something that's been in our team is getting obsessed about. You are an innovation fund. I'm guessing you're looking at this. How much of this is hype and hope versus a potential legit reality and how do you play it? Well, it was interesting when when the news broke a little more than a week ago and many people just thought it was a fraud. But our chief futurist, Brett Winton, said, wait a minute, this is not a fraud. It can't be a fraud because it's so simple. You you can buy from, you can buy, you can buy phosphorus, copper. And there was one other ingredient there, and you could actually follow their instructions and duplicate this. We're going to find out pretty quickly. And what it does seem is that it is possible. So we went from thinking Friday a week ago, oh, maybe ten, 15% chance to now, while the markets the betting markets are up 40%, I think we're more in the 60% plus range. So and you know, it could it could be the breakthrough we need for quantum computing or at least bringing it into reality from a commercialization point of view sooner than expected or or those high speed trains, it could change so many things, and particularly our electric system where, you know, we lose so much heat in data centers, where we lose so much energy because of the inefficiencies associated with current electricity. Cathy, I promised Florida, but I actually want to start in China and get your current views on what the stock market there looks like because a few years ago you were out and I think you came back. A little bit. And JD.com. What's your current thinking around the equity market in China and what opportunities are there or not? Well, we're we're maintaining our position. Really common prosperity suggests that the government is aiming for for companies not to be too profitable, but to really help the country to expand and make the lives of everyone better, which is noble. That's what we all want is to, you know, shrink the divide between the rich and the poor. We are focused on a few things there. We're focused on the fact that China is exporting deflation. It's down for 5.4%. And it is one reason that we think that the world is going to face more of a deflationary period here than I think most people think. It's also very interesting to watch the yuan. I think that the government would be stimulating more aggressively if the yen were a little stronger and it has been weakening and they're very careful about their currency. So I don't think they're going to be able to stimulate as much as many people might like or expect because the yuan is showing some fundamental weakness here. And you know what's so interesting about that? Sorry, I just want to add an exclamation point here. The fact that they're exporting deflation and they're the yuan is down. That's that's a double whammy. That is that from from from China's point of view, you know, the fact to see deflation as their currency is down, Normally when a currency is down, you see inflation. So, Kathy, we know you moved to Florida from New York City. I believe you were in the Chelsea neighborhood. I visited your office way back in the day. Yes. You're now down in Florida. A lot of asset managers, a lot of people who watch Bloomberg TV are considering moves like this. How has it changed your investing process, if at all? Being there? Are there pros and cons to being in Florida versus in New York City? I guess the the the there's for us no change in our investment process. Covid told us we could work remotely and so we have a hybrid setup, but we do have rotations of all of the teams through Saint Petersburg, Florida, and even more so during the winter, I might add. So that's working out. But I think it's it's it's been a wonderful place for us and it's great to have everyone come together, either in various teams or all together like reunions. So it's working pretty well for us. We only have a few seconds left, so I'll just ask a short question. Elon Musk and Zuckerberg may have a cage match fight. Do you have do you take a side in that in that fight? Do you do you think Musk is up to the task? I whenever he puts his mind to something, I wouldn't I wouldn't bet against him. That's what I'll say. But I did read this morning that he's saying that or tweeting that he has to probably go for a back operation first for something to having to do with his disks. So I would I would hope that he would wait until he's completely on the mend."

Long term investors continue accumulating Bitcoin, despite the asset\u2019s recent price action, industry experts told Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin plunges under US$30,000 amid market turbulence. Is US$27,000 next?\n\nDogecoin leads declines across most top 10 cryptos\n\nBitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,161 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it fell below the US$30,000 support level on July 24. Despite struggling to rally higher in recent weeks, industry experts say that Bitcoin\u2019s accumulation remains robust among long-term holders.\n\n\u201cWhat we see today is very similar to this stage of previous cycles \u2013 an absence of speculative activity and intense accumulation with coins moving to high conviction, sticky hands \u2013 with more in cold storage than ever before,\u201d wrote Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, to Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe metrics we track that encapsulate asset-accumulation behavior have never been more robust. Nearly 75% of the issued supply is held in wallets where the coins haven\u2019t moved for more than six months. And for the first time, there are now over 1 million \u201cwhole Bitcoiners\u201d \u2013 people owning at least 1 full BTC.\u201d\n\nIn the crypto market, Ether rose 0.21% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,828 and declined 0.36% during the past week.\n\nDogecoin was the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, after it fell 1.54% in the past 24 hours to US$0.07352, followed by Polkadot\u2019s DOT token that declined 0.57% to US$4.96.\n\nLeading the winners, the XRP coin rose 1.05% to US$0.6203, followed by Solana\u2019s SOL token that gained 0.68% to US$23.24\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.21% to US$1.16 trillion while market volume increased 42.48% to US$32.32 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nPayPal\u2019s stablecoin lifts NFT sales on Ethereum, top NFT blockchains\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.69% to 2,476.83 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 1.3% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales continued yesterday\u2019s decline, falling 14.92% to US$365,955 with the network slipping to the eighth largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales recovered after yesterday\u2019s slump, rising 19.43% to US$8.05 million, while sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, declined 10.40% to US$563,891. Its twin collection, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, rose 26.24% to US$630,187, becoming the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection by 24-hour sales volume.\n\n\u201cA rare day in the green with sales volume across most blockchains up double-digit percentages. Bitcoin however is still struggling,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cPaypal announcing the launch of a stablecoin has excited the NFT market a bit, as they look forward to an easy way to onboard the masses to crypto.\u201d\n\nPaypal launched the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin on Monday.

Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posted declines.\n\nInvestor appetite remained subdued, after China\u2019s trade figures showed that exports from the country fell by 14.5% in July, the biggest fall since the beginning of the pandemic. Imports also dropped at the highest pace since January.\n\nDespite yesterday\u2019s strong session, U.S. stock futures fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all declining.\n\nTraders remained cautious ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data for July, scheduled for Thursday, as this can also signal the path for further interest rate decisions.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are now anticipating earnings from companies like UPS, Zoetis and Duke Energy Corporation.\n\nEuropean equities fell on Tuesday, extending Monday\u2019s decline, with the Dax losing 0.9% and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling 0.71%, as markets lacked notable catalysts.\n\nSee related article: Standard Chartered\u2019s great expectations for Bitcoin in 2024\n\nUpdates with equities section"

        "content": "00:00\n\nSo you are in this race. Let's talk about the race a little bit. The first important deadline coming up is August 13th, where the AAC filing, the SCC is either going to delay it, which we think they'll probably delay it. And then BlackRock is later you filed before BlackRock but BlackRock came in with the surveillance sharing agreement with Coinbase that was novel. Right now we're looking in the future. There's talk of a common clock where the SCC could approve a bunch of ETFs at once, putting you on a level playing field with BlackRock and others. What's your take on how this will play out given you filed earlier? I think you're probably right that August 13th will come and go and I think I think the FCC, if it's going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once. So then again, because most of these essentially will be the same and it will come down to marketing and communicating the message. You know, we've been putting out our Bitcoin Monthly for the for the last year. We are now starting a Bitcoin brainstorming session. Our first one we launched last Thursday. So we're trying to get the word out there that, you know, our research is deep and we've been doing it since 2015 when we gained our first exposure to BTC. We were the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin at all in 2015. That's exactly where I want to go. The grayscale Bitcoin trust known by its ticker gbtc. If you look at our W, for example, your ARK next generation Internet ETF. Right now I see GBTC as the third largest holding. If we are in a situation where the SEC does give its blessing for a spot Bitcoin ETF, would you plan to sell out of gbtc and buy one of these physically backed funds? I cannot talk about what we would and would not do. And in fact, our compliance team is, you know, giving us marching orders not to talk very much about this filing and its aftermath at all. So just the fact that we filed with our partner 21 shares is is as far as as I can go."

        "content": "Binance on Tuesday became the first crypto exchange to receive full operating licenses under El Salvador\u2019s new digital assets regulation, almost two years after the Central American country became the first to declare Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nAs Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, faces scrutiny from global regulators, its approval by El Salvador\u2019s central bank and National Commission of Digital Assets represents a step forward for the embattled company, even as it\u2019s forced out of other jurisdictions.\n\nIn a statement shared with Fortune, Min Lin, Binance\u2019s new head of Latin America, touted the Salvadoran government\u2019s support of crypto, saying that it \u201cproves security and innovation are complementary assets.\u201d\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin has come with its own stumbles. President Nayib Bukele announced the initiative in June 2021, arguing that a new focus on Bitcoin could help drive independence for the country\u2019s economy, which is reliant on remittances and the U.S. dollar, as well as spur tourism and business development.\n\nElecting for a rapid rollout, the launch just three months later\u2014including a government-sponsored crypto wallet called Chivo\u2014was riddled with bugs and fraud. After incentivizing sign-ups with a $30 reward, Bitcoin adoption quickly slowed, with most businesses and residents sticking with fiat currency.\n\nThe Bukele administration also promised a $1 billion bond backed by Bitcoin that would help lessen its reliance on multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund, although the measure was delayed as the government dragged its feet on passing digital assets regulation.\n\nWhile the bond hasn\u2019t yet materialized, the country\u2019s legislature finally passed the law in January, which established the National Commission of Digital Assets. In April, the crypto firm Bitfinex\u2014a partner on the Bitcoin bond project\u2014became the first platform to receive a license under the new regulatory regime. The crypto payments app Strike also received one of the first licenses, with the company announcing in May that it would move its global headquarters to El Salvador. Its founder, Jack Mallers, was an early supporter of the country\u2019s Bitcoin initiative.\n\nWith Tuesday\u2019s announcement, Binance is the first exchange to receive operating licenses from both El Salvador\u2019s central bank and its National Commission of Digital Assets. According to the company, it now has approvals and registrations in 18 global markets.\n\nDespite its approval in El Salvador, and a recent victory in Dubai, Binance has been under heat from global regulators. In the U.S., it faces lawsuits from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, plus likely imminent action from the Department of Justice. The exchange has also faced scrutiny from European authorities, with French prosecutors investigating the company for violating anti-money-laundering laws and Dutch regulators rejecting its application to become a virtual assets services provider.\n\nBinance\u2019s approval in El Salvador also comes with caveats, as the Bukele administration faces criticism for authoritarian actions, including a recent crackdown on gang activity and a push for a constitutionally prohibited consecutive term.\n\nBukele once declared himself the \u201ccoolest dictator in the world\u201d in his Twitter bio. It now reads \u201cPhilosopher King.\u201d"

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nA rebound in the price of bitcoin has sharply narrowed losses for MicroStrategy's (MSTR) holdings of the cryptocurrency. When Michael Saylor stepped down almost exactly a year ago as CEO of MicroStrategy to become its executive chairman with a sole focus on investing in bitcoin, his digital-asset strategy was looking pretty bleak. He had already spent billions of dollars of MicroStrategy\u2019s money to purchase bitcoin \u2014 and his paper loss amounted to about $1 billion. Today, though, MicroStrategy\u2019s position looks brighter as bitcoin\u2019s price has rebounded to above $29,000. Saylor has bought more. MicroStrategy now owns 152,800 bitcoins, up from 129,699 when he surrendered the CEO job. The new purchases have lowered MicroStrategy\u2019s cost basis to $29,672. Bottom line: MicroStrategy, a software company that has become a proxy for bitcoin's price because of its largest holdings of the cryptocurrency, is nearly back in the black with bitcoin.\n\nA spokesperson for Huobi is denying reports that several executives were arrested in China as outflow from the exchange picks up. Over the weekend, financial media in Hong Kong reported that several executives at Huobi had been taken away by police in China. According to data from Nansen.ai, Huobi\u2019s stablecoin exchange balances have dropped by 33% in the last week, with traders withdrawing $49 million. Earlier, Colin Wu of Wu Blockchain had posted that \u201ca large number of senior executives of offshore cryptocurrency exchanges \u2026 have been detained and investigated by the Chinese police\u201d without adding specifics.\n\nCurve Finance has recouped 73% of the funds stolen during a hack, which saw the platform lose over $73 million worth of various tokens. Over the past week, all $22 million in ether and ether derivatives stolen from Alchemix were returned. Curve, which lets users cheaply swap stablecoins on its platform, was hit by a reentrancy attack that allowed attackers to steal tokens from Curve, and lending and borrowing platforms Metronome and Alchemix.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart of the Day\n\nThe chart shows monthly changes in the turnover on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange, by trading volume and open interest.\n\nAs the volatility meltdown continued, the cumulative turnover in crypto options, perpetual futures and standard futures segments declined by 27% to $37 billion in July.\n\nStill, the exchange accounted for 88% of the global crypto options activity.\n\n- Omkar Godbole\n\nTrending Posts"

Ether\u2019s (ETH) readings are hovering just 1.3% higher than its historic lows witnessed at the end of July.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s realized volatility, meanwhile, dropped to a six-year low during July, \u201csuggesting the potential for significant price action in either direction,\u201d Ark Invest wrote in its monthly report.\n\nMarket observers have begun to take note, highlighting those volatility changes reflected in the narrowing width between bitcoin\u2019s weekly Bollinger Bands.\n\nThe Bollinger Band Width (BBW) is a simplified tool from the Bollinger Band that signals volatility changes. It represents the gap between the upper and lower bands and merges the three Bollinger lines into one. Essentially, it measures the difference between the two bands.\n\nBBW has now dropped to its lowest recorded levels on a weekly timeframe, exchange data shows. Analysts have begun to divine that the reading\u2019s historically low levels could indicate a potentially large outsized move is imminent, as seen throughout the asset\u2019s prior cycles.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Traders have been sitting on their hands lately with the Bitcoin price being stuck between $29,000 and $30,000. This rangebound price action can\u2019t continue forever, though.\n\nBitcoin awaits breakout\n\nA recent report from ARK Invest entitled \u201cBitcoin \u2014 Breakout or Breakdown?\u201d notes that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s volatility dropped to a 6-year low during July, suggesting the potential for significant price action in either direction.\u201d\n\nThis is not news to anyone watching the crypto markets lately.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price Bollinger Bands echo January gains\n\nWhat traders might not be anticipating, however, is the historical price action for Bitcoin (BTC) during the months of August and September, along with the effects of monetary policy on cryptocurrency markets.\n\nMarkets haven\u2019t fully priced in Fed tightening\n\nThe ARK Invest report suggests that Federal Reserve tightening could be \u201ca leading indicator of price deflation\u201d and notes that there can be a lag associated with monetary policy.\n\nIn other words, \u201cthe real economy and inflation have yet to digest 300-500 basis points\u201d of Fed tightening. China\u2019s exporting of deflation also adds fuel to the deflationary fire, the report states.\n\nFederal funds effective rate: current and lagged. Source: ARK Invest\n\nThis puts the lagging effect of Fed tightening on course to collide with Bitcoin\u2019s halving rally in 2024-2025. If ARK\u2019s analysis proves to be correct, the next bull run will likely be tame compared to previous cycles.\n\nYet some analysts believe just the opposite: Because the Fed has finished raising rates (or is nearing the end of its tightening cycle), the macro situation is about to become even more auspicious for Bitcoin.\n\nMorpher CEO Martin Froehler recently told Forbes that he expects the 2023 Bitcoin rally to resume:\n\n\u201cWe are almost done with the interest rate hike cycle, so the current macroeconomic headwinds will soon begin to fade. Simultaneously, we are about 9 months away from the next Bitcoin halving event, which historically has always propelled the price up dramatically.\u201d\n\nKyle DaCruz, director of digital assets product at VanEck, expressed similar sentiments to Forbes by saying that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity combined with unprecedented growth in the money supply could lead to a continued rally.\n\nIf history is any guide, however, that rally isn\u2019t likely to materialize just yet.\n\nBTC price rally to resume in 2024?\n\nHistorically speaking, August and September are the worst months of the year for the BTC price.\n\nFrom 2011-2022, August saw a positive performance for BTC only five times, with the other seven years being in the red. September is even worse, with just four out of 12 months seeing a positive performance.\n\nHistorical Bitcoin monthly price performance table. Source: Bitcoinmonthlyreturn.com\n\nWhat\u2019s more, five of the 12 negative Septembers saw only single-digit price decreases, a small move for an asset as historically volatile as BTC/USD. The average move in September has been -5%, while the average move in August stands at +0.73%.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has indeed flatlined in the past few weeks, with BTC price volatility falling to record lows.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin market observer Will Clemente notes that all of Bitcoin\u2019s negatively performing years have occurred two years post-halving, suggesting the worst of the bear market could be in the past.\n\nBitcoin's down years have all come in the second year after the halving. (2014, 2018, 2022)\n\n\n\nThese next two years should be cool pic.twitter.com/vVW0Dc4yvo \u2014 Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) August 7, 2023\n\nThis would mean that the largest gains for Bitcoin lie ahead through 2024 and 2025. As noted earlier, however, if this timeline coincides with the deflation and potential recession forecast by ARK Invest, downward pressure on the BTC price may offset many of the gains in the next potential bull cycle.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Though the show had rarely, if ever, mentioned cryptocurrency prior to its most recent episode, digital assets have steadily become a part of mainstream movies and television series, from animated shows like South Park to Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nInterestingly, Futurama did not address why the characters \u2014 even in a fictionalized comedic future \u2014 would still be mining Bitcoin in 3023. Based on the BTC halving process, estimates suggest the last block reward will most likely come in roughly 2140, at which point the incentive for miners \"can transition entirely to transaction fees\", according to the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises\n\nUpdate (Aug. 14 at 2:12 PM UTC): This article has been updated to include details on incentives for Bitcoin miners."

        "content": "Blockstream CEO Adam Back, one of the crypto\u2019s early pioneers, is pretty confident Bitcoin will hit an all-time high of over $100,000 before Bitcoin's halving in 2024 \u2014 and is willing to drop a million wagering on it.\n\nIn an Aug. 7 conversation on X (formerly known as Twitter), Back agreed to a bet with pseudonymous X user @Vikingobbitcoin that Bitcoin would reach $100,000 by March 31, 2024. Vinkingo said they believe it won\u2019t happen until 2025.\n\nThe origins of the wager. Source: X\n\nThe wagered date comes in roughly a month before the halving \u2014 which is currently on track for April 26 \u2014 as Back believes that the price will \u201cprobably\u201d reach a new all-time high sooner than the actual date of the halving.\n\nBets on dramatic increases in the price of Bitcoin have attracted huge sums in the past, such as Balaji Srinivasan\u2019s $1 million 90-day Bitcoin bet in March.\n\nBeck\u2019s also been bullish about Bitcoin in the past, saying in February that Bitcoin could reach $10 million by the sixth halving in 2032.\n\nThis time, Back is actually setting down hard-earned funds to back his most recent claim. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a million satoshis, not U.S. dollars. That\u2019s only $290 in current prices (or over $1,000 if Back\u2019s prediction comes true).\n\nAdam Back accepts 1 million satoshi wager. Source: Twitter\n\nA satoshi \u2014 \u201csat\u201d for short \u2014 is the smallest divisible unit of Bitcoin, and there are 100 million sats to a single BTC.\n\nThus, it\u2019s a rather small bet for Back, given his net worth is estimated to be somewhere between $50 and $300 million.\n\nRelated: How will Bitcoin halving affect BTC price, and is DeFi dead?\n\nHowever, in a response to Back\u2019s original post, Jan3 CEO and fellow Bitcoiner Samson Mow said that he too expects a new all-time high for Bitcoin \u201cpre halving, not post.\u201d\n\nI also think new ATH pre-halving, not post. \u2014 Samson Mow (@Excellion) August 5, 2023\n\nDespite the small bet, it has attracted some snide replies in the responses \u2014 but still reflects a growing bullish trend on the price of Bitcoin among market commentators and analysts ahead of next year\u2019s halving.\n\nMeanwhile, in a Feb. 24 interview with Cointelegraph, Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole Investments, said that the upcoming halving will see Bitcoin become the \u201chardest asset in the world\u201d and predicted that the market is already in the early stages of a new bull cycle.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

At the time, Mr. Xu lacked fiat funds, and so the parties settled on using Bitcoin for the borrowing through a written agreement. Shortly afterward, however, Mr. Lin defaulted on the loan, prompting Mr. Xu to sue in the Changzhou Zhonglou People\u2019s Court. The case was dismissed.\n\nChinese magistrate Ming Wang explains why the Bitcoin lending contract was invalid and therefore denied relief for breach of contract. (Screenshot)\n\nIn supporting the judgment, Ming Wang, vice-magistrate of the Changzhou Zhonglou People\u2019s Court, told reporters that Bitcoin is a digital commodity that does not hold the same legal status as fiat currencies. Therefore, the asset can neither be subject to a legal enforcement action, enter circulation, or be used to \u201d award compensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lender bears ALL risks [when lending crypto],\u201d Wang warned. That said, in another ruling dated Nov. 29, the Hangzhou Internet Court wrote that digital assets such as nonfungible tokens are \u201conline virtual property\u201d that should be protected under Chinese law.\n\nAside from outright ownership, all forms of cryptocurrencies and transactions are currently illegal in China. The country has been cracking down on private blockchain initiatives in favor of the Central Government\u2019s efforts to promote centralized blockchain, such as via the digital yuan CBDC.\n\nChina\u2019s disappearing Web3 founders\n\nJust last month, Chinese cross-chain bridge Multichain was still one of the biggest in the DeFi sector. While its reputation took a hit due to the disappearance of its co-founder, Zhaojun He, the protocol still had around $1.5 billion in total value locked at the start of July.\n\nThen on July 14, investors\u2019 worst fears came true after Multichain developers revealed that Zhaojun had been arrested by Chinese police nearly two months prior. Because Zhaojun held discretionary control of Multichain\u2019s entire server-based and private keys, they said the protocol had to be shut down.\n\n\n\nBut the question left many readers pondering, how does the arrest of a single individual lead to the shutdown of an entire enterprise and the disappearance of enterprise funds? One anonymous user in the Multichain Telegram chat claimed:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a total supply chain. Third-party tracking companies will supply leads to the police to take them into custody as long as the [Web3] co-founder is in China and has money. Where do you think the police\u2019s case came from? Third-party tracking companies make at up to 10 figures [CNY] from such tipoffs.\u201d\n\nWhile Zhaojun is currently detained without any revelation of the charges \u2014 or any news whatsoever \u2014 the Multichain funds supposedly \u201cstuck\u201d in the protocol are on the move. Blockchain security firms, such as Bitrace and PeckShield, have revealed that since Zhaojun\u2019s arrest, assets stored on the Multichain bridge had been swapped for stablecoins and transferred out of the protocol. The move prompted stablecoin issuers such as Circle and Tether to freeze over $63 million of suspicious transactions linked to Multichain.\n\nA man alleged to be Multichain co-founder and CEO Zhao Jun (Telegram)\n\nIn a series of screenshots seen by Cointelegraph, exchanges such as Binance are also investigating stablecoin deposits to its platform linked to the Multichain incident. Meanwhile, whoever is making the transfers has appeared to smarten up as well, with swaps of users\u2019 assets now being done through privacy coins as opposed to traceable assets.\n\nSome observers theorize that the circumstantial evidence points to the Chinese police moving the coins. For starters, the In a similar incident, Wuwei Liang, brother of CoinXP co-founder Liang Liang, wrote in regard to the ongoing criminal proceedings against his brother and the firm:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe virtual currency involved in the case [seized from CoinXP by police] was transferred to other wallet addresses by the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, and 20 Bitcoins disappeared during the transfer process and have not been recovered so far.\u201d\n\nLiang Liang\u2019s trial is ongoing and the blockchain executive is currently charged with \u201cillegal solicitation of public funds\u201d and running a \u201cmulti-level marketing\u201d scheme. The latter, by the way, carries the penalty of civil forfeiture of all personal and enterprise assets if convicted, and the trial is not going well.\n\nThe crackdown appears to have started with China\u2019s own state-blockchain centralization efforts this year. On May 31, Cointelegraph reported that offices of the Chinese offshore-yuan stablecoin issuer CNHC had been raided by police. Its executive had been reportedly detained and like Multichain, no news has been heard from them since.\n\nHuobi in trouble once again Everything is just fine\n\nIf I could sum up with everything that goes on in blockchain from day to day using one phrase, it\u2019d be \u201call is not, as it seems.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, local news outlets in Hong Kong reported that senior executives of cryptocurrency exchange Huobi had been arrested by Chinese police. The exchange subsequently denied this as \u201cfake news.\u201d Chinese blockchain personality Justin Sun, the de-facto owner of the exchange, also labeled the news as fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD).\n\nBut as Adam Cochran, partner of Cinneamhain Ventures, claimed on Twitter that Sun allegedly withdrew $60 million from the exchange after the news broke out. Cochran also claimed that some Huobi staff \u201care currently under criminal investigation,\u201d citing an insider at Tron (Sun\u2019s blockchain project) who has \u201cfirst hand knowledge of the investigation.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to Sun, Huobi is doing just fine. On August 1, Sun claimed that the exchange generated more than $85 million in profits in Q2 2023, with $100 million in profits projected for Q3 2023. Pretty impressive, considering that the exchange suffered an internal revolt just earlier this year after the firm allegedly slashed a vast majority of employment benefits.\n\nBut anyway swirling rumors around Huobi may be behind its USDT reserves declining to less than $100 million from $630 million last month, while its total assets have fallen to $2.5 billion compared to $3.1 billion in the same period.\n\nHuobi\u2019s total assets vs. inflows (DeFiLlama)"

        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Tuesday morning in Asia after U.S. multinational payment giant PayPal launched a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin on Monday. Ether was still treading water, however, as all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower. Dogecoin led the losers. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose, as NFT trading volume also picked up. U.S. stock futures traded flat after Wall Street closed higher on Monday, as investors await the release of U.S. inflation data Thursday.\n\nPivotal role for PayPal stablecoin?\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.28% in the last 24 hours to US$29,133.55 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong but remained down 0.25% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly dropped to a low of US$28,724.14 on early Tuesday morning.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw outflows totaling US$107 million in the week ending August 4, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. That marked the fourth consecutive week of outflows as profit taking gathered pace in recent weeks.\n\nBitcoin-related products saw weekly outflows totaling US$111 million, the largest for a week since March. However, outflows into Bitcoin short positions stopped for the first time in the past 14 weeks, according to the CoinShares report. Allowing investors to profit when the token\u2019s price drops, the report\u2019s authors said that the stall in short position outflows suggests institutional investors may be adjusting their Bitcoin strategies.\n\nEther dipped 0.13% to US$1,824.53, and lost 1.72% over the past seven days.\n\nPaypal ramped up its efforts in the Web3 space by launching the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin on Monday. The Ethereum-based token is issued by Paxos Trust Company \u2014 the U.S.-based issuer of Binance\u2019s BUSD stablecoin \u2014 and is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. treasuries and similar cash equivalents.\n\nPaypal\u2019s stablecoin project was reportedly halted in February 2023 amid increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators toward stablecoins \u2014 including an order for Paxos to stop minting BUSD.\n\nToday, we\u2019re unveiling a new stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). It\u2019s designed for payments and is backed by highly liquid and secure assets. Starting today and rolling out in the next few weeks, you\u2019ll be able to buy, sell, hold and transfer PYUSD. Learn more https://t.co/53RRBhmNHx pic.twitter.com/53ur2KmjU7 \u2014 PayPal (@PayPal) August 7, 2023\n\n\u201cPayPal\u2019s news today is a testament to the burgeoning popularity of DeFi,\u201d said Tony Petrov, chief legal officer at identity verification platform Sumsub.\n\nThe move highlights the \u201cpivotal role\u201d to be played by stablecoins as a bridge between digital and fiat currencies, Petrov continued. \u201cThis rapid ascent signals a major transformation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and the potential impact of stablecoins on the global financial landscape is an exciting development to monitor closely,\u201d he added.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded lower, with Dogecoin leading the losers. The meme token dropped 1.65% to US$0.07325 and logged a weekly loss of 5.86%.\n\nThe month of July saw a decrease in crypto trading activities, with Bitcoin volume decreasing 13.1% during the month, Ether falling by 21.9% and stablecoins volumes down 12.3%.\n\n\u201cThe data emphasizes a moment of low activity in the market, which follows a strong uptrend in the first half of 2023,\u201d said Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia International.\n\n\u201cSummer months are notoriously among the ones with the lowest level of trading activity and 2023 data are perfectly aligned with historical metrics on the matter. The overall outlook for 2023 remains extremely positive so far as the institutional / service providers\u2019 news seen in the past few weeks still indicates strong interest towards the market,\u201d Greco added.\n\nFor Greco, signs of that interest include multiple applications in the U.S. for exchange-traded funds (ETF) for Bitcoin and Ether. He also pointed to Hong Kong, where regulators have granted crypto exchanges HashKey Exchange and OKX licenses to offer crypto trading services to retail investors.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.11% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while trading volume gained 59.07% to US$32.76 billion.\n\nTremors of NFT excitement following PayPal news\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index gained 0.62% in the past 24 hours to 2,478.88 as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. However, it was still down 1.36% lower for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano indexes logged losses.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 15.80% in the past 24 hours to US$13.09 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. The volumes on Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains all logged increases.\n\n\u201cPaypal announcing the launch of a stablecoin has excited the NFT market a bit, as they look forward to an easy way to onboard the masses to crypto,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\nHowever, NFT trading activity remains downbeat compared to the meteoric highs of late 2021 and 2022. Total NFT trading volume last week totaled US$87.76 million, over 60% lower than the start of the year, according to CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cNow, sales volume is clearly lower. (But) It\u2019s not the only measurement of growth,\u201d said Petscher in a Youtube video posted Monday. Unique buyers, unique sellers and total transactions have all grown considerably since this time two years ago, he added.\n\n\u201cBut the ecosystem has matured. The NFTs are getting cheaper. The supply is getting greater. It\u2019s a different space. And it\u2019s exactly what we need to reach the masses,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nIn terms of NFT collections, Mythos Chain-based NFT marketplace DMarket posted the largest 24-hour trading volume but still dipped 4.48% to US$931,685. ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained Cards and Ethereum-based Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) ranked second and third.\n\nGrails IV, the latest NFT collection issued by NFT startup Proof, started minting on Monday. The collection features artwork from 20 artists whose identities will be revealed when minting is completed Friday.\n\nThe Grails minting window has opened.\n\n\n\nIn less than an hour, more than 450 pieces have been minted. Grails #3, 4, 5, 18, and 19 are sold out!\n\n\n\nWhich did you choose? https://t.co/PquuNwVUOl \u2014 PROOF (\ud83e\udd43,\ud83e\udd89) (@proof_xyz) August 7, 2023\n\n\u201cProof\u2019s Grails IV collection has started minting, so expect some movement with art in general as collectors welcome some new future grails to their wallets. Artists will reveal soon which should add some excitement to the space,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nChina export woes and more US rate hikes ahead?\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 11:50 a.m. on Tuesday in Hong Kong after the three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher in regular trading on Monday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and South Korea\u2019s Kospi remained flat, Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged gains, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped.\n\nAmid the U.S. second-quarter reporting season, 79% of S&P 500 companies have released earnings higher than analyst expectations. That is the highest beat rate since the third quarter of 2021, Reuters reported on Monday citing data from Refinitiv.\n\nInvestors now await U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data on Thursday. Analysts expect core CPI to rise 0.2% in July, which would be the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said on Monday that multiple interest rate hikes may still be needed to curb inflation.\n\n\u201cWe have made progress in lowering inflation over the past year, but inflation is still significantly above the FOMC\u2019s two percent target, and the labor market continues to be tight, with job openings still far exceeding the number of available workers,\u201d said Bowman in a Monday speech.\n\n\u201cGiven these developments, I supported raising the federal funds rate at our July meeting, and I expect that additional increases will likely be needed to lower inflation to the FOMC\u2019s goal,\u201d said Bowman.\n\nThe Fed meets on September 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance the Fed will raise rates by a further 25-basis-points.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s exports in July slid 14.5% year-on-year to US$201.16 billion. Imports also posted an annual decrease of 12.4%, Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday.\n\nAs the country attempts to support its economic recovery by stimulating domestic demand, the drop in July exports was the biggest decline since February 2020. The figure fell well below analyst expectations.\n\n\u201cThe government policy so far has changed but more on the property sector, and not much on boosting demand,\u201d Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd, told Bloomberg. \u201cSo the economic situation is still quite challenging.\u201d\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Wednesday morning in Asia to trade above US$29,700. Ether also logged gains along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Solana led the winners with an almost 5% jump. The crypto rally followed PayPal\u2019s launch of a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin on Monday. That coincided with a sharp drop in global government bond yields Tuesday after the release of China\u2019s weaker-than-expected economic data. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged higher on increased trading volumes, while U.S. stock futures traded lower as ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded several mid-size U.S. banks.\n\nCryptos rally\n\nBitcoin rose 2.02% in the last 24 hours to US$29,764.75 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong and moved up 0.41% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly breached the US$30,000 resistance level on early Wednesday morning.\n\nEther gained 1.61% to US$1,855.88 but was still down 0.82% over the past seven days. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher, with Solana\u2019s SOL leading the winners. The token rose 4.93% to US$24.19 and logged a weekly gain of 1.07%.\n\nThe crypto market received a boost from global payment giant PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch on Monday. Known as PayPal USD (PYUSD), the stablecoin will allow users in the U.S. to make transfers to compatible external wallets, pay other customers and purchase foreign currencies using the token.\n\n\u201cPayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch is an important development for crypto within the U.S. Although the initial launch is limited, with PayPal\u2019s size and global reach, it is likely to impact global stablecoin usage and adoption going forward,\u201d said William Cai, co-founder and managing partner at U.S.-based asset management firm Wilshire Phoenix.\n\n\u201cIt is another clear signal of institutional confidence that crypto isn\u2019t going away and will emerge from this \u2018crypto winter\u2019 stronger,\u201d added Cai. \u201cStablecoin is the grease of the crypto markets. Overall increase in stablecoin market cap will coincide with a major upward trend in crypto prices.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nGreta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-headquartered digital asset exchange VDX, said that while it is not the first time major institutions have entered the stablecoin space, previous attempts met with substantial regulatory obstacles.\n\n\u201cThe recent progress of a bill aimed at establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, coupled with PayPal\u2019s deep expertise in the payment industry, has the potential to set up PayPal for a more promising growth path,\u201d Yuan added\n\nMeanwhile, Ark Invest Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood said in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg that she expected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve multiple spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) at the same time.\n\nThere is now a growing sense of optimism that successful ETF applications from major U.S. asset managers including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Wisdom Tree could be the start of large-scale institutional investment in the digital asset space.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Mike Novogratz, CEO of investment management firm Galaxy Capital, reportedly said via conference call that the SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin ETF was likely a matter of \u201cwhen, not if.\u201d Issuers of Bitcoin ETF would, he said, \u201cfight like cats and dogs to win market share\u201d once they received approvals.\n\n\u201cThis could have caused the 3-4% rally in Bitcoin prices overnight,\u201d said Markus Thielen, Head of Research & Strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport.\n\n\u201cA common pattern is emerging where Bitcoin prices tend to rally during US trading hours but retrace during Asian trading hours,\u201d Thielen added. \u201cNevertheless, Bitcoin is still in a trading range but a potential SEC approval could push prices higher.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.71% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume moved up 9.37% to US$36 billion.\n\nSome pep in the step for NFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index inched up 0.14% in the past 24 hours to 2,483.18 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 0.90% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum NFT index also logged gains, while the Solana, Polygon and Cardano indexes dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume surged 64.03% in the past 24 hours to over US$20.4 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volume on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all also logged increases, while the Bitcoin blockchain saw a drop.\n\n\u201cAgain we\u2019re in the green and suddenly there\u2019s a little pep in traders\u2019 step,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really beginning to see the type of NFTs that do well in this market, which is cheaper NFTs with high volume. DMarket, Gods Unchained, Sorare and DraftKings all represent a form of gaming, all are pretty darn affordable, and all have thousands of traders. This is what the future of NFTs will really look like,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Polygon-based DraftKings saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. It rose 26.23% to over US$4.12 million for 85% of total NFT trading volume on the Polygon network. The collection is based on sports and betting company DraftKings\u2019 NFT games.\n\nForkast Labs\u2019 Petscher said that Paypal\u2019s stablecoin launch is providing a timely boost for the NFT industry. The global payment giant could prove successful in onboarding those unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies into the NFT space, he said Tuesday in a video uploaded to Youtube.\n\n\u201cGive them some PayPal stablecoin and then watch OpenSea integrated, and then let them buy Starbucks NFTs on secondary with their PayPal stablecoins,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cThis is huge for the world of crypto and it\u2019s huge for NFTs. This is what building looks like.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NFTs are seeing growing interest in the art space.\n\nU.K.-based NFT platform ElmonX announced Wednesday that it will partner with international image licensing company Bridgeman Images to mint \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d \u2014 a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 as NFT collectibles. The painting was sold for US$$450.3 million at the Christie\u2019s auction house in 2017, making it the most expensive artwork ever sold.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's masterpiece: Salvator Mundi \ud83d\udd2e\n\n\n\nRediscovered, restored, and auctioned for a record-breaking USD 450,312,500 in 2017, making it the world's most expensive artwork ever sold \ud83d\udcc8\n\n\n\nTwo digital collectibles drop Saturday 12th August 9AM PT only on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nAppalhFSC \u2014 ElmonX (@elmonx_official) August 8, 2023\n\nElsewhere, Chinese artist Yue Minjun on Tuesday launched Kingdom of the Laughing Man \u2014 a collection of unique NFTs based on his artworks \u2014 on NFT platform LiveArt. The collection has logged a 24-hour sales volume of over US$978,000 and sits third in Crypto Slam\u2019s sales volume rankings, right behind Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nU.S. equities drop on bank downgrades, China records annual decline\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures moved higher. The U.S. stock market closed lower on Tuesday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were also mixed on Wednesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged losses, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose.\n\nOn Tuesday, Moody\u2019s Investor Service lowered the credit rating of 10 small and midsize U.S. banks citing funding risks and weaker profitability. The ratings agency warned that it could downgrade several other major U.S. lenders including U.S. Bancorp, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and State Street Corp.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big deal in the bigger picture of how the economy operates, because regional banks\u2019 lending is one of the main lubricants of the economy,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at asset manager Glenmede, in a Reuters report published Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIf it slows down, the engine just doesn\u2019t work as well,\u201d Pride added.\n\nAll eyes are now on the release of U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data on Thursday. Bloomberg analysts expect the core CPI to rise 0.2% in July, which would be the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years.\n\nOn the U.S. inflation front, the Federal Reserve meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates.\n\nThe rate now stands at between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance the Fed will raise rates by a further 25-basis-points.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s July CPI posted an annual decrease of 0.3%. The Producer Price Index (PPI) also dropped 4.4% year-on-year, Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.\n\nThe dip in July CPI data represents China\u2019s first annual decline since February 2021. However, the drop was smaller than the analysts\u2019 expectation of 0.4%.\n\n\u201cChina is in deflation, for sure, the question is for how long.\u201d Robin Xing, chief China economist for Morgan Stanley, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the policy makers how they react.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving influences market sentiment and the profitability of miners, among other things\n\nAdam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, bets big that Bitcoin will reach a record high of over $100,000\n\nPrevious Bitcoin price halvings have been long-term bullish factors for the crypto\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is a significant event that impacts market mood, miner profitability, and innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. According to Adam Back, it should also grow the currency price. The crypto community is already weighing in with various predictions on Bitcoin\u2019s potential price with less than a year to go.\n\nBitcoin To Exceed $100,000 Before Its 2024 Halving?\n\nOne of the early cryptocurrency pioneers, Blockstream\u2019s CEO Adam Back, is certain that Bitcoin will reach an all-time high of over $100,000 before it is halved in April 2024 and is willing to stake 1 million Satoshis on it (a hundredth of a Bitcoin, or around $290 at current prices)\n\nIn a chat on X (formerly known as Twitter) on August 7, Back and anonymous X user @Vikingobbitcoin settled on a wager that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by March 31, 2024. According to Vinkingo , it probably won\u2019t occur until 2025.\n\nCCN reached out to Adam Back for commentary but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing\n\nBack predicts that the price will \u201cprobably\u201d achieve a new all-time high before the halves, which is scheduled for April 26. This puts the wagered date close to a month before the splitting.\n\nHuge sums have previously been wagered on sharp increases in the price of Bitcoin, such as Balaji Srinivasan \u2018s $1 million 90-day Bitcoin wager in March.\n\nBack Investing His Own Money \u2013 Community Laughs\n\nAdditionally, Back has previously expressed optimism about Bitcoin, stating in February that it might hit $10 million by the sixth halving in 2032. He then mentioned that the flagship crypto asset could explode to a $200 trillion market cap in the next nine years.\n\nearly this year i was curious of the claim \"bitcoin 2x's per year on average\". it checks: the decade jan 2013 \u2013 dec 2022 #bitcoin went up 2.036x/year (1200x in a decade). if that continues we'll cross $10mil/BTC and $200 tril market cap by end of next 2 halvenings, about 9 years. pic.twitter.com/mqmO2SRdAv \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) February 12, 2023\n\nThis time, Back is investing his own money to support his most recent assertion.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of dollars, it\u2019s a million satoshis currently, but, if Back\u2019s forecast comes true \u2014 he will receive more than $1,000.\n\nThe smallest division of a Bitcoin is called a satoshi, or \u201csat\u201d for short. There are 100 million sats in a single BTC.\n\nGiven that Back\u2019s net worth is thought to be somewhere between $50 and $300 million , it is therefore a relatively minor wager for him.\n\nSamson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a fellow Bitcoiner, responded to Back\u2019s original article by stating that he too anticipates a new all-time high for Bitcoin, but \u201cpre-halving, not post.\u201d\n\nthe bet is on\ud83d\ude80: i bet #bitcoin reaches or exceeds $100k between now and halving (31st Mar 2024) with @vikingobitcoin9 1million sats to the winner. https://t.co/Ij7iPEYjQW pic.twitter.com/PNpAaZvl8F \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) August 5, 2023\n\nBack\u2019s little wager has received some sarcastic comments ; nonetheless, it still indicates an increasing bullish tendency among market pundits and analysts on the price of Bitcoin ahead of next year\u2019s halving.\n\nadam please let me know if you need help financing that $300 bet \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) August 5, 2023\n\nWho is Back, and Why Care About his Predictions?\n\nLike David Chaum and Hal Finney, Adam Back is a \u201cBritish cryptographer and cypherpunk\u201d from London who was \u201ca pioneer of early digital asset research.\u201d\n\nHe created the cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work technique Hashcash in 1997. When mining, Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function as the mining core, and Bitcoin miners are expending their effort creating hashcash proof-of-work, which acts as a vote in the blockchain evolution and validate the blockchain transaction log.\n\nWhen giving his predictions, Back usually talks about the macro factors that he believes will make his price prediction come true. In short, he seems to think that the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the U.S., is responsible for all the factors that define Bitcoin price. Such a macroeconomic view differentiates him from the crypto experts, who usually focus only on crypto and not the whole ecosystem per se.\n\neveryone has their pet macro-views. my guess: stock market + US election season, moral hazard kicks up, QE ramps up again, rates drop again, money printer goes into over-drive. so the interest rate overhang falls off. and BTC decorrelates somewhere along the way once defi flushed \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) June 16, 2022\n\nAlso, it\u2019s good to know that Back primarily used two methods to amass his wealth. First, by purchasing Bitcoin in 2011, when one cost between $0.70 and $15. Even a modest purchase made at the time for $10,000 would be worth more than $30 million now.\n\nAdam Back did a fantastic job of capitalizing on his early interest in and exposure to the cypherpunk movement by investing very early in Bitcoin and creating a billion-dollar business in the same industry. He has been fortunate enough to amass a sizeable net worth from his endeavors, maybe between $100 and $300 million.\n\nWhy People Predict Around the Halving?\n\nFollowing a halving, there is typically an uptick in volatility for Bitcoin. With less Bitcoin in circulation, its value rises, and investors find it more desirable.\n\nWhen examining the post-halving booms in Bitcoin, other factors should be taken into account:\n\nmore press coverage on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\na curiosity about the privacy of the digital asset\n\na steady rise in the number of real-world applications for the money\n\nIf you trust in the importance of history, previous Bitcoin price halvings have been long-term bullish factors for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, the subsequent halving will almost certainly have various effects on the BTC ecosystem. The number of Bitcoin miners is generally expected to fall as the financial incentive to mine diminishes and, for less skilled miners, becomes unprofitable."

        "content": "STEVENS POINT, Wis. (WSAW) - Every day it seems like scammers are getting more creative and now there is a new scam hitting Stevens Point that involves Bitcoin ATMs.\n\nHere is how the scam works:\n\nYou receive an email from PayPal saying your account has fraudulent activity, then you will be asked to make a transaction at Bitcoin.\n\nThey may ask you to transact a certain amount of money from your account, one person in Stevens Point was asked to send $16,000. If you don\u2019t answer the first call, they\u2019ll likely keep calling until you do or you do something about it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very direct, they tell you exactly what to do, and they won\u2019t let you hang up the phone,\u201d said Lieutenant Joseph Johnson of the Stevens Point Police Department.\n\nNow, they\u2019re telling you something bad has happened, but they can fix it.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want you to hang up the phone, they want to stay on the phone with you the entire time and walk you through the process. They say if it doesn\u2019t work here, let\u2019s drive up to Weston or go somewhere else,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nThis is exactly what one victim did. Police say she really thought she had to send this money, so she went to the Bitcoin ATM and deposited $16,000, even though one UPS worker saw the red flags.\n\n\u201cThey saw people get out on their phone and go into the store for the same exact thing, so obviously they intercepted that right away and told them, \u201cHey, you\u2019re getting scammed and explained to them why and how we knew they were getting scammed because clearly, they believed in the process,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nSo, this is what you have to remember to do your research. It\u2019s okay to be curious but be prepared to end the conversation.\n\n\u201cSame number comes up ten times, answer it. You know, if you want to answer it, answer it, but then if you know, in the first five seconds or ten seconds, \u201cYeah, this doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d you just hang up. You know that\u2019s the part that gets you is the engagement,\u201d said Director Bureau of Consumer Protection for the State of Wisconsin Michael Domke.\n\nThis is the advice Domke gives, watch the news, see what scams are out there before you give away your money.\n\nCopyright 2023 WSAW.

        "title": "CPI report may show uptick in US inflation \u2014 How will Bitcoin price react? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The S&P 500 index is currently trading only 6% below its all-time high, which was reached in January 202. Traditionally, such a situation would be seen as a bullish sign for risk-on assets, including commodities and cryptocurrencies, but this time, it appears that investors have been using the stock market as a means of protection against the recent inflation surge, which sustained at over 4% between April 2021 and May 2023.\n\nFor Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency investors, inflation has typically been viewed as a positive factor influencing the price, as evidenced by the previous all-time highs of $65,000 and $69,000 that occurred during a period of monetary expansion and increasing inflation in 2021. However, the current situation is different because inflation is making a comeback while the Federal Reserve has been effectively reducing liquidity in the system. As a result, the impact of inflation on cryptocurrencies remains uncertain.\n\nIs the tech stock bubble bursting?\n\nThe recent seven-day decline in tech giants \u2014 including Fortinet (FTNT) with a decrease of 25.7%, Block Inc. (SQ) with a drop of 20.5%, PayPal (PYPL) down by 15%, Shopify (SHOP) down 14.8% and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) down 13.9% \u2014 has caught the attention of investors, particularly in light of the expectation of an additional interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee on Sept. 20.\n\nEconomists predict that the Consumer Price Index for July, which will be revealed on Aug. 10, will be around 3.3%, surpassing the previous month\u2019s figure of 3% and exceeding the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Given the latest unemployment rate of 3.5% in June, nearing a 40-year low, the Fed moving toward tightening the economy becomes more certain.\n\nGold, a traditional safe haven, has struggled to surpass the $2,000 mark on multiple occasions since 2020, indicating a lack of confidence in its ability to hedge against risks.\n\nGold price in USD (blue, right) vs. S&P 500 index (orange, left). Source: TradingView\n\nThe real estate market has also been impacted, facing limited housing supply and rising mortgage rates, as evidenced by Redfin\u2019s second-quarter revenue drop of 21% compared to the previous year. The company expects a further decline of 15% to 20% in transaction value for Q3.\n\nEven traditional safe assets like bonds are losing some of their appeal due to the ongoing increase in the United States federal debt. Investment mogul and hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman reportedly shorted 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, expressing concerns about long-term inflation.\n\nA July 31 report by the U.S. Treasury Department revealed a $1 trillion quarterly net borrowing estimate and an unexpected Fitch Ratings downgrade of U.S. debt, further fueling concerns in the financial markets.\n\nConsequently, investors are now seeking alternative markets, and Bitcoin whales have increased their leverage long positions using derivatives despite the cryptocurrency\u2019s price remaining around $29,500.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price support at $29,000 is backed by solid derivatives metrics\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures typically trade at a slight premium relative to spot markets, as sellers demand more money to delay the settlement. Healthy markets usually display BTC futures contracts trading at a 5% to 10% annualized premium, a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe BTC futures premium (or basis rate) on platforms like Deribit and OKX reached 8%, the highest in over three weeks. This higher premium signals pro traders are willing to pay an additional cost to engage in leverage longs, thus reflecting a positive sentiment toward Bitcoin.\n\nTraders can also gauge the market\u2019s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe put-to-call ratio has been below 1.0 since July 24, revealing a strong demand for call (buy) instruments. Such data suggests investors' optimism for the potential price appreciation of Bitcoin.\n\nThere is a growing indication that Bitcoin might potentially benefit from the inflation surge. However, if investors start to believe that the Federal Reserve\u2019s idea of a soft landing for the economy is unlikely and that a severe recession is on the horizon, they are likely to favor Treasurys and cash positions initially.\n\nIn the short-to-mid term, there is not much evidence to suggest that Bitcoin will experience a significant surge if inflation becomes widespread in the United States. Nevertheless, there is hope for bullish investors, as the cryptocurrency has shown solid support at the $29,000 mark.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Stablecoins stand out as a highly profitable vertical within the cryptocurrency realm, particularly in a context of higher interest rates. This is especially true considering that stablecoin reserve portfolios typically comprise Treasuries, which have the potential to generate returns exceeding 5%.\n\nWhat is a Stablecoin?\n\nA stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a tangible asset like a fiat currency (e.g., US Dollar, Euro) or a commodity (e.g., gold). Unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can experience significant price volatility, stablecoins aim to provide a more consistent and reliable value. They are often used in digital transactions, trading, and as a store of value due to their relatively steady price characteristics.\n\nPayPal Trading at a Discount\n\nReflecting a mixed earnings revisions trend, PayPal currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. However, the stock is trading near its all-time low valuation. Today, PYPL is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 16.2x, which is below the industry average of 47x, and well below its 10-year median of 43.2x.\n\nWhile P/E ratios are hardly a market timing tool, it is certainly worth noting just how cheaply PayPal is trading from a historical perspective.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Players\n\nBitcoin and other crypto adjacent stocks have enjoyed strong YTD returns, even with the SEC cracking down on some of the biggest players.\n\nCoinbase COIN , the publicly trade cryptocurrency brokerage was recently sued by the SEC. The SEC alleges that Coinbase has been running an unregistered broker and clearing house, putting into question the entire business model. Yet COIN stock has rallied 140% YTD, nonetheless.\n\nWhile Coinbase may still appear too risky an investment considering its current legal troubles, and PayPal has a subpar Zacks Rank, there is one stock investors may want to consider.\n\nBlock SQ , Jack Dorsey\u2019s fintech company is a top ranked stock with exposure Bitcoin. Block has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions and is expected to roll out a new crypto product this year.\n\nBlock is planning to release Bitkey, a hardware-based crypto key that will function as a self-custody wallet. Jack Dorsey is a well-known proponent of Bitcoin and regularly speaks on his support of blockchain technology and Bitcoin as an important economic tool.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBullish Setup in Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, along with the crypto stocks and broader market has been on a strong run this year already up 72% YTD.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, if Bitcoin can breakout above the $29,600 level it may begin the next bull leg higher. Alternatively, if it can\u2019t hold the $28,500 level, Bitcoin traders should be cautious as the technical setup will be invalidated.\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nInvestors looking to get exposure to Bitcoin without directly buying the crypto may want to consider BITO by ProShares. BITO is a Bitcoin linked ETF that is constructed using Bitcoin futures rather than spot Bitcoin. BITO is currently the best option for access through the equity market.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPayPal expanding its offerings is another positive step in the right direction for the cryptocurrency industry. As one of the original digital payment innovators, PayPal makes for a sensible medium for those looking to enter crypto.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t know for certain how Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market will respond to this news, I consider it quite bullish, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it acted as a catalyst for a rally.\n\nZacks Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

        "title": "The Bitcoin Skeptic: Why Bitcoin Will Never Replace Fiat Currency - CCN.com",
        "content": "As the resident bitcoin skeptic at CCN.com, today I\u2019ll be looking at the myth that bitcoin will one day replace all fiat currencies.\n\nThe Bull Fiat Currency Case for Bitcoin\n\nThe bullish argument goes as follows: governments are increasing their borrowings to unprecedented and unsustainable levels. The debt burden will eventually cause governments to collapse, even the United States, and even under President Trump!\n\nWhen that happens, there is no more \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the government to back the respective currencies. The public will follow suit, and gone will be the days when fiat is used to purchase all manner of goods and services, as well as for leisure purposes such as playing on online casinos.\n\nThe Bear Fiat Currency Bitcoin Case\n\nWhile it is certainly possible that these insane levels of debt may eventually crater individual sovereign nations, along with their currencies, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be of no value in those circumstances.\n\nThat\u2019s because, at the moment that the local currency is considered worthless, no bitcoin seller will sell his bitcoin in exchange for a worthless currency.\n\nBears will now shout, \u201cVenezuelans are selling their increasingly worthless Bol\u00edvars for bitcoin, and have been for some time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the Bolivar is still a viable currency, despite the ongoing hyperinflation. A bitcoin seller can still transfer the currency into another form of currency. The market is still liquid for Bolivars, although not for much longer.\n\nWorse, holding bitcoin in a country that is no longer in civil control will not be of any value to the buyer/owner.\n\nIf a fiat currency totally collapses, the resulting civil unrest may very well take out the power grid. Those people who have cryptocurrencies may not even be able to access them.\n\nIf Fiat Currency Collapses, Only Tangible Goods Will Matter\n\nMore to the point, people living in these countries will only be in need of the basics for survival: food, water, shelter, guns, and ammo.\n\nOffering to pay for these necessities in the form of bitcoin is not going to do the seller any good, because bitcoin will not be of any tangible value in these moments of need.\n\nDoes the seller think he will be able to convert bitcoin into US dollars, walk over to the local bank, and withdraw US dollars? That\u2019s not going to happen, because the banks will already be holding nothing but worthless local currency\u2026if they aren\u2019t on fire.\n\nEven worse, bitcoin is insanely volatile.\n\nAnyone that does manage to change their local currency into bitcoin may find that the value of the bitcoin they just purchased declines by a substantial amount in a matter of minutes.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen this happen multiple times, it\u2019s going to continue to happen, and that\u2019s because of the very thing that the coin both love to crow about: the limited number of available bitcoins. In a limited market with high demand, there will always be volatility that is far above average.\n\nThe Final Irony of Bitcoin Value\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of how one actually measures the value of a bitcoin. In an ironic scenario worthy of O. Henry, how is the value of bitcoin expressed around the world? In terms of the local fiat currency!\n\nFor as much as they grow about the replacement of fiat currency, pickling bulls value their cryptocurrencies in terms of that very same fiat currency.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxUwKd6FoEw\n\nIf fiat currency is worthless, what is a bitcoin actually worth? It\u2019s worth whatever someone is willing to barter or trade for.\n\nAgain, in periods of civil unrest, the things that are actually traded are tangible objects.\n\nIf I\u2019m going to sell you a gun, how many bitcoins are you going to pay me for it, when a bitcoin doesn\u2019t do me any good in terms of surviving?\n\nThe fiat currency replacement argument does not work. Bitcoin is, frankly, for suckers in the long term. The best you can do is trade like a whale."

        "title": "Free Bitcoin on Zaps experiment \u2014 but what are Zaps? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) advocate based in Canada has \u201cZapped\u201d 600 people a total of 300 satoshis ($0.09, or 0.000003 BTC) each in a Bitcoin-inspired social media experiment.\n\nTo date, marketing executive Michael Degroot has doled out over $50 in Bitcoin to people around the globe. He has since been Zapped back more than 40 times, receiving more than $6.\n\nDoing an experiment on @orangepillapp I\u2019m going to be zapping & connecting with everyone who has their lightning wallet attached. ~700 people, if you aren\u2019t on there already here\u2019s my referral code. https://t.co/ADO92uEDqr I\u2019ll be updating this thread while I zap people #Bitcoin \u2014 Michael Degroot (@_mikedegroot) July 31, 2023\n\nBut what are Zaps, and how is it possible to send money around the world without an intermediary?\n\nDegroot recently signed up for the Orange Pill App, a social media platform that connects Bitcoin users from around the world. The app works similarly to Tinder or Meetups, with the mission to connect Bitcoiners in real life.\n\nThe app recently integrated Zaps, or Bitcoin tips, and according to founder Matteo Pellegrini, 20% of users have added Zaps to their profiles.\n\nZaps use the layer-2 Lightning Network, which runs on top of Bitcoin. Zaps are typically small or tiny amounts of Bitcoin, measured in satoshis, that are sent peer-to-peer.\n\nTo Zap, users have two choices: create a noncustodial Lightning wallet using a Lightning node or open a custodial Lightning wallet. When users opt for a custodial solution, a third party such as Wallet of Satoshi, Blink or CoinCorner manages the Bitcoin. They take care of routing, Lightning channels and liquidity.\n\nUsers can then create a Lightning address, known as an LNURL, to receive Zaps. Think of the LNURL as an email address, but for money. By adding this address to profiles on platforms including Orange Pill App, Geyser Fund or Nostr, users can receive Bitcoin from people all around the world, instantly and at almost no cost.\n\nBitcoin tipping, or Zapping, is mobile-first.\n\nCrucially, there is seldom a Zapping middleman, and it works well with micropayments, such as Degroot\u2019s 300 sats payment. Money remitters such as PayPal, Western Union or wire transfers charge a fee to route money around the world but are ineffective for micropayments due to high fees.\n\nZapping removes the need for a middleman, which also removes a money-making opportunity. Pellegrini explained: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost us anything when users Zap each other, and we don\u2019t, nor shouldn\u2019t, make any money off it.\u201d\n\nBrian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase \u2014 the United States\u2019 largest crypto exchange \u2014 recently confused a Lightning address, or Zap address, for an email address. It\u2019s fair to say that Zaps have yet to light up the mainstream crypto conversation.\n\nZapathon\n\nBack to Degroot\u2019s Zapathon. The Canadian \u201cmessaged and zapped every single person on the Orange Pill App who has a Lightning wallet attached to their profile,\u201d he disclosed to Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cI want to contribute to the community more, and I thought this was a way I could contribute and I could increase Bitcoiners in my network. A way to find more signal.\u201d\n\nBut while Degroot expanded his network, gaining hundreds of X (formerly known as Twitter) followers, the generous act also demonstrated the power of the Lightning Network\u2019s money transfer mechanism. Degroot Zapped 300 sats (less than $0.10) to someone living 16,000 kilometers (9,940 miles) away in South Africa, expressing: \u201cIt settled in a second, and there was no fee for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to own a business, and if someone paid us with a credit card before a weekend, it could take up to five days for those funds to reach our bank account, and cost ~2.5%.\u201d\n\nDegroot also Zapped me (please note that this was not a bribe to write this article!) It cost nothing despite the fact that we are separated by the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nZapping on Nostr\n\nWhile Orange Pill App, Geyser Fund and Stacker News are Zap-arenas, the tipping feature has been increasingly popularised by Nostr, which stands for \u201cNotes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays.\u201d In its present form, Nostr is a decentralized alternative to centralized social media platforms such as X or Reddit.\n\nZaps sent on Nostr over the past six months. Source: Nostr.Band\n\nNostr is a protocol that comes to life by integrating with clients such as Damus (for iPhone) or Snort (for desktop). Nostr recently reached 4 million users, while hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin has been zapped across the world. Curiously, the \u201clike\u201d button does exist on Nostr platforms, but Zaps are sometimes favored over likes.\n\nWhy are people giving out free money on the internet?\n\nZapping is a Bitcoiner behavior that, at first glance, doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Why give out Bitcoin to strangers on the internet, knowing that it is a scarce asset? There is only 21 million BTC, or 2.1 quadrillion sats, and it\u2019s highly unlikely that more will be mined.\n\nJeff Booth, founder of Ego Death Capital, told Cointelegraph: \u201cSo for people in Bitcoin and on Nostr, that economy is emerging, and it\u2019s really early.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor people that aren\u2019t in that world, they wouldn\u2019t see what we\u2019re talking about. If you\u2019re measuring from the existing system, you don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nI asked Nostr users why they sent sats. The responses were light-hearted, fun and moving. BitcoinSandy, a Nostrich (a Nostr user), explained that \u201cit is a really good feeling sending instant value to someone likeminded who values freedom.\u201d\n\nManlikeweks explained that Nostr\u2019s borderless and censorship-resistant properties are awesome, particularly \u201cas a person based in Tanzania and being funded worldwide without any restrictions.\u201d\n\nZapping also taps into the trend of value for value, or creator compensation. Digital creators can monetize content directly, without the need for a middleman.\n\nBitcoinBarry explained how it works in practice: \u201cI often try to give answers where I can and am rewarded to give better than suboptimal answers too.\u201d I.e., if you post useful content on Nostr, you may be rewarded with a bountiful Zap \u2014 much like you would tip a waiter in a restaurant for excellent service.\n\nNostrich JoeLibertarian spelled it out: \u201cSats speak louder than likes.\u201d You can like a post on Nostr, or you can send the post sats to truly express satisfaction and gratitude.\n\nNostr-ings attached?\n\nNostr is not without hiccups. Apple recently delisted Damus from the App Store due to the Bitcoin tipping feature. Apple said Zaps violate payment policies: \u201cIf they [users] are connected to or associated with receiving digital content, they must use in-app purchase in accordance with guideline 3.1.1.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Nostr is a protocol, not a centralized service. Clients similar to Damus have since popped up on the Apple App Store, such as Plebstr.\n\nRegarding Orange Pill App, Pellegrini explained to Cointelegraph that there is no risk of being deplatformed by Apple. Why? Pellegrini explains, \u201cWe gave Tim Cook [Apple\u2019s CEO] a free Orange Pill App membership!\u201d\n\n\u201cJoking aside, there\u2019s no feed on the app, so the zapping is via profiles that are not classified as content, unlike notes/tweets.\u201d\n\nApple can continue its crusade of Nostr platforms where content can be easily monetized, but as popular Nostr creator Walker points out, Nostr is \u201ca freedom-loving hydra.\u201d If you remove one Nostr-playground, others will pop up:\n\nApple bends the knee to the CCP and removes @damusapp from the App Store in China after one day\u2026\n\n\n\nThey will soon discover #nostr is a freedom-loving hydra\u2026\n\n\n\nCut off one head and two will grow in its place.\n\n\n\nYou cannot kill it; fighting it only makes it stronger. pic.twitter.com/D3UTFtx2mR \u2014 Walker\u26a1\ufe0f (@WalkerAmerica) February 2, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, Degroot\u2019s quest continues. He hopes to Zap every user on Orange Pill App, buoyed by the enthusiasm he\u2019s met with from fellow users:\n\n\u201cMy favorite response was \u2018Thank you for sending me those sats. I have never been zapped before \u2014 you made my day!\u2019\u201d\n\nHe concluded the experiment on Aug. 7, telling the Zap-curious to \u201cDO IT.\u201d\n\nI sent ~600 zaps for a total of 180,000 sats and was zapped back ~40 times with many people telling me they would pay it forward. Had one person send me back 50x what I sent them & another 80x to support the cause. If you have the chance to zap someone for the first time DO IT\u26a1\ufe0f \u2014 Michael Degroot (@_mikedegroot) August 7, 2023\n\nUltimately, Degroot regularly Zapped profiles who received their first-ever sats. Pellegrini summed it up sweetly: \u201cAfter all, who doesn\u2019t like some sweet sweet sats?\u201d"

        "title": "Could Stacks Be a Multibillion-Dollar Cryptocurrency? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, explosive growth is a well-known phenomenon. With tens of thousands of digital assets, identifying the next high-growth crypto with untapped long-term potential can be challenging.\n\nHowever, amid the many options, one cryptocurrency stands out as a strong contender for the next big player in the market: Stacks (STX -3.59%). Let's explore why Stacks has the potential to be the next high-growth crypto and how it could reach a multibillion-dollar valuation.\n\nBringing unique functionality to Bitcoin\n\nStacks, currently ranked as the No. 47 most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap with a valuation of about $880 million, has made significant strides since its mainnet launch in 2021. However, the project's ultimate goal is to achieve something revolutionary -- making Bitcoin (BTC -0.64%) programmable by integrating smart contracts.\n\nAs the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has always been known for its robustness and security. Still, its lack of programmability has driven developers to other blockchains to explore decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Stacks aims to change this narrative by unlocking the potential of Bitcoin's underlying technology and creating a bridge between the world of decentralized finance and the world's original cryptocurrency.\n\nStacks, as a Layer-2 solution, operates independently from Bitcoin's blockchain yet remains fully compatible with it and offers support for smart contracts, which form the backbone of decentralized applications. This unique architecture enables all transactions conducted on the Stacks network to eventually settle on the Bitcoin blockchain, creating a powerful connection between the two.\n\nMoreover, Stacks can read and interpret transactions happening on the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to build applications that execute based on Bitcoin-based criteria. This integration opens up a new realm of possibilities, combining the security and stability of Bitcoin with the flexibility and functionality of smart contracts, paving the way for innovative and robust decentralized applications on the Stacks network.\n\nFully programmable Bitcoin is within reach\n\nStacks' Nakamoto Release represents a significant leap forward in its mission to make Bitcoin programmable and unleash its full potential. With this upgrade, developers will gain full write access to Bitcoin, and users can seamlessly utilize their native Bitcoin within the Stacks ecosystem, eliminating any counterparty risk. This groundbreaking feature is not currently in existence but once unveiled, it will represent a landmark development in Bitcoin's move into finance.\n\nFurthermore, the Nakamoto Release enhances transaction speed and security. Bitcoin's slow transaction speeds have been a limitation, but Stacks aims to address this by introducing fast blocks that can process transactions in just five seconds. In addition, the Nakamoto Release will back Stacks' blockchain with the unmatched security of Bitcoin itself. Any attempt to compromise Stacks would require hackers to breach Bitcoin's security, an incredibly formidable challenge that safeguards the Stacks ecosystem and its users.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe potential of Stacks is clear, as it offers unprecedented opportunities to expand Bitcoin's use cases. Considering the immense value of Bitcoin, Stacks' impact could be monumental.\n\nBy comparison, Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchains used for application development, has about 10% of its market cap used in decentralized applications. If Stacks achieves a similar level of adoption for Bitcoin, it could create an economy valued at around $60 billion in today's prices. Although Stacks' total market cap may not reach 10% of Bitcoin's, it will serve as the supporting blockchain for this new economy.\n\nA more likely target is 3% of Bitcoin's market cap, which is one of Stacks' key objectives. A 19-fold increase from today's prices would be necessary to accomplish this, leading to an impressive total valuation of nearly $17 billion. While such progress may require some time, the innovative and transformative vision of Stacks has the potential to revolutionize the world of finance.\n\nAs things stand, Stacks already represents a solid investment choice, yet with the highly anticipated Nakamoto Release on the horizon, this cryptocurrency could move to the forefront of the industry."

        "title": "Why Many Crypto Stocks Soared Last Month -- Without a Bitcoin Tailwind - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nMany companies with deep ties to the cryptocurrency market saw strong stock gains in July 2023. MicroStrategy (MSTR -4.18%) posted a 27.9% gain last month, CleanSpark (CLSK 3.76%) shares rose by 40%, and Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%) took the lead with a 56.7% price increase, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nMoves like these usually come alongside rising Bitcoin (BTC -0.30%) prices, but that was not the case last month. Bitcoin actually saw its token prices sliding 3.9% lower over the same period. So why did Cleanspark, MicroStrategy, and Riot soar without that typical tailwind at their backs?\n\nSo what\n\nThe crypto-adjacent industry demonstrated its commitment to mining and owning Bitcoin for the long haul.\n\nFor example, Riot's operations report on July 6 paid more attention to the Bitcoin-mining company's equipment purchases and installations than to the 460 tokens Riot mined and 400 coins sold in June. Furthermore, the report highlighted Riot's ability to scale down its Bitcoin production and resell energy to a strained Texan power grid as the heat waves of June kept air conditioners running.\n\nFellow Bitcoin miner CleanSpark wasn't affected by the Texas heat, with most of its mining equipment hosted in Washington state. So the company ran its slightly smaller collection of mining rigs at full capacity, producing 491 new coins in July and selling 413 of them in order to finance operations. At the same time, CleanSpark shone a spotlight on its expanding facilities in Washington and recently acquired assets in Georgia. The company is buying thousands of mining machines, securing energy supplies to power them, and expanding its Bitcoin-mining capacity as quickly as possible.\n\nMicroStrategy is a different story. The business intelligence software specialist doesn't mine new Bitcoins like CleanSpark and Riot do, but bends over backward to invest in the cryptocurrency. As revealed in the second-quarter earnings release on Aug. 1, the company bought 12,333 new Bitcoins in the second quarter and held a total of 152,800 tokens on its balance sheet by the end of July. The purchases were backed by MicroStrategy's operating cash flows and available credit facilities.\n\nOn top of these Bitcoin-bullish moves, the global and American economies showed signs of life in July. These three stocks posted their strongest gains of the month on July 13, rising in tandem as inflation rose slower than expected. That's good news in the long run for debt-burdened businesses, and these three Bitcoin wranglers fit that bill.\n\nNow what\n\nIt's worth mentioning that companies adjacent to the crypto industry often amplify the gains and drops of the underlying digital assets. In this case, Bitcoin itself was unmoved by the economy's quirks because the cryptocurrency itself has nothing to do with interest rates on financial debt. But CleanSpark has more debt than cash on hand, and MicroStrategy has sunk 97% of its cash into Bitcoin ownership. Riot Platforms has the cleanest balance sheet of this bunch, but even this solid business would be up the creek without a digital paddle if Bitcoin prices drop again.\n\nSo it's no shock to see Riot, CleanSpark, and MicroStrategy making big moves in one direction while Bitcoin slowly slides in the opposite direction. These stocks can be seen as a jumpy harbinger of the distant future -- today's risk-relieving economy trends may pave the way to even faster mining facility builds and Bitcoin buys in upcoming quarters.\n\nAs for Bitcoin's modest price changes in recent weeks, the leading cryptocurrency strikes me as an indispensable investment idea right now. This is not the time or the place to go into a detailed discussion of that idea, but you can read up on the upcoming \"halvening\" event right here."

        "content": "Bitcoin daily\n\nBitcoin is in the midst of its best day in almost a month. It's up 2.3%, or $752 to $29,925 as it threatens to retake $30,000 for the first time in a week.\n\nThe catalyst for the buying appears to be the Moody's downgrade of several medium-sized US banks and threats to cut larger once. The Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp, State Street and Truist Financial were all put on review for downgrades following downgrades to 10 smaller banks.\n\n\"Many banks' second-quarter results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital,\" Moody's said in a note. \"This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline, with particular risks in some banks\u2019 commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.\"\n\nI certainly wouldn't argue with that reasoning and hold-to-maturity losses make it difficult to raise money via debt.\n\nDuring the peak of the banking troubles in March, Bitcoin made one way move to $28,000 from $20,000 and later continued to $30,000. Signs of fresh trouble are likely aiding the price action today.\n\nTechnically, Bitcoin found something of a bottom near $28,500 as it bottomed there last week and again this week. That's a sign of a double bottom that would target $31,000.\n\nIn the bigger picture, Bitcoin bulls are excited about signs of a potential ETF approval as filings continue to roll in for BTC and ETH exchange-traded products. Reports have suggested the SEC is at least open to considering allowing ETFs and that's something that would clear the way for Americans to own crypto in retirement accounts more easily.\n\nFor broader markets, strength in Bitcoin sometimes signals burgeoning optimism so there's a potential buy-the-dip mantality that could be unfolding, though I lean towards banking troubles as the main driver. The KRE US regional bank index is down 1.9%."

        "content": "Since its inception, Bitcoin has been steadily growing. A pizza that was once worth 10,000 BTC is now just 0.00058 BTC. Well, the price of Pizza has not gone down. It\u2019s the Bitcoin that went all the way from $0 to $30,000.\n\nToday, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is $574 billion, the highest among all the other currencies. It represents a market dominance of 46.65% despite many ups and downs. Growing at a CAGR of 16.3% from 2022 to 2031, the global Bitcoin payments market is expected to hit $3788.2 billion by 2031. The day isn\u2019t far when it will be accepted as a global currency.\n\nLet\u2019s understand what makes Bitcoin popular among consumers and why you should consider enabling crypto payments.\n\n5 factors accelerating Bitcoin\u2019s adoptionFully decentralized & permissionless\n\nBlockchain is an underlying technology that enables permissionless, peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions. This means no intermediaries can govern your transactions. And hence, payments made via Bitcoin can not be blocked or reversed by anyone \u2014 making it a reliable currency for day-to-day transactions.\n\nSeamless global transactions\n\nAccepting money from abroad through banks and traditional payment gateways is time-consuming, expensive, and unreliable. Most of the time, you will end up paying over 30% in transaction fees to these financial institutions. On the contrary, you can start accepting Bitcoins from anywhere around the world in real time whilst paying minimal transaction fees.\n\nWide accessibility\n\nAccording to a World Bank report, over 1.4 billion adults are unbanked. These people neither have a bank account nor access to mortgage, debit/credit cards, or online banking services. This cuts them out from all the opportunities to invest, borrow credit, and grow their wealth. Bitcoin can empower these individuals as anyone around the world can access it. All they need is a smartphone and internet connection to transact in Bitcoins. As a merchant, if you start accepting Bitcoins, you will be able to reach a wider audience.\n\nSecurity\n\nBanks are 300 times more susceptible to cyber-attacks \u2014 according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group. Thus, funds parked at your local bank are not 100% safe. Instead, if you use Bitcoin, all your transactions will be encrypted by cryptography and will be stored on Blockchain \u2014 making them permanent and irrevocable. So far, not a single blockchain has been compromised. This makes them a better alternative to fiat money.\n\nRemain anonymous\n\nBitcoin payments are private and anonymous. While you can track and trace all the transactions to their origin, it\u2019s almost impossible to associate a real-world identity with any particular transaction. This allows you to transact anonymously and offer privacy to your customers.\n\n\n\nCompanies embracing Bitcoin as a standard payment method\n\nOver 15,000 businesses around the world are already using Bitcoin as a standard payment method. That\u2019s primarily because crypto payments are cheaper to process, censorship-resistant, and easily transferable. Here are a few popular brands accepting Bitcoins:\n\nMicrosoft\n\nEtsy\n\nTwitch\n\nHome Depot\n\nKFC\n\nVirgin Galactic\n\nThousands of other popular brands and businesses also accept Bitcoins. Check out our list of top companies accepting Bitcoin payments.\n\n\n\nThe future is Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the future of payments. According to the latest report by Blockware Solutions, Bitcoin adoption will hit 10% in 2030, and post that, the growth will be parabolic, eventually reaching 80% population by 2050.\n\nWe already know only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist in its ecosystem. If we divide that number by 8 billion \u2014 which is the global population \u2014 you can predict the value of Bitcoin in the coming years. Owning just one Bitcoin today and holding it for a long time could end up generating generational wealth.\n\nA boost in Bitcoin\u2019s adoption will trigger a massive increase in the number of businesses accepting crypto payments.\n\nAre you ready for the paradigm shift?\n\nIf you are a business owner, now is the right time to start accepting Bitcoin payments. Enabling Bitcoin transactions across your online and offline touchpoints will help you enhance your checkout experience, reach a larger audience, and save hundreds of thousands of dollars in transaction fees.\n\nSign up with Speed- Leadning Bitcoin Payment Processor today to start accepting Bitcoins on the go. From dynamic payment QRs to a mobile Point-of-sale application and pre-built checkout page, Speed offers a wide range of payment features for accepting Bitcoins across your online and offline channels.

        "title": "Beware The Crypto SPOT ETF Bubble - Morningstar",
        "content": "The evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape has been an exhilarating journey filled with astonishing stories of rags-to-riches wealth, regulatory hurdles, and alleged fraud.\n\nDespite these challenges, the cryptocurrency market has surpassed the remarkable point of over $1 trillion (\u00a3787.5 billion) in market capitalisation in the second quarter of 2023. It\u2019s a point 10 years in the making. The first crypto-related fund, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), was launched in 2013, and over the years the number of crypto-related funds has skyrocketed.\n\nThe first key turning point was the bull run of 2017, when the price of Bitcoin shot up. As Bitcoin rose, so did the number of crypto products. Subsequently, between 2018 and 2020, the market lost most of its gains and several funds faced closure. The post-Covid-19 era then brought another bull run in the crypto market and the number of crypto products once more exploded across the United States and Europe, demanding the attention of investors worldwide.\n\nThe euphoria was tainted in the crypto winter. 2022 proved to be a disastrous for cryptocurrencies, with notable liquidations at Terra, Three Arrows, and FTX. Until that point, most crypto investments revolved around Crypto-based ETFs and Trusts.\n\nDespite the turbulence, crypto has managed to remain in the spotlight, thanks to recent developments at the Securities and Exchange Commission, where the US regulator is reviewing proposals for Crypto Spot ETFs and the launch of leveraged futures ETFs.\n\nA Bull Market Phenomenon\n\nCrypto managed investment products come in various sizes and shapes, including physical crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), synthetic crypto ETPs, and inverse crypto ETPs.\n\nThe below visual demonstrates the recent launches and shutdowns of crypto ETPs as discussed in our earlier paper Cryptos Are a Bull Market Phenomenon. Over the last year, the number of funds being liquidated has risen significantly. On average, all the funds that get liquidated have an average life of less than one year and average assets of around $500,000 at shutdown.\n\nLeveraged Crypto ETPs\n\nThe latest product to join the crypto bandwagon is leveraged crypto ETPs. The SEC approved the first ever leveraged crypto ETF with the launch of Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) in late June 2023. BITX seeks to provide daily investment results, before fees and expenses, which correspond to twice the performance of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index for a single day. The fund does not invest directly in bitcoin. Instead, it seeks to mimic the performance of bitcoin futures contracts daily.\n\nLike all leveraged products, these are inherently highly risky. Add to that the risk associated with the overall crypto market, the performance of leveraged crypto ETFs can be highly unpredictable.\n\nThe chart above shows this ETF's daily returns compares it with the return of Bitcoin and S&P 500. As is evident, the leveraged ETF\u2019s daily returns have been highly volatile, with a standard deviation of 4.3% daily. In comparison, Bitcoin had a daily standard deviation of about 1.6 % and the broader equity markets had a daily standard deviation of around 1% during the same period. This shows the asset is not only much riskier than equities, but also much more volatile than Bitcoin itself.\n\nOne salient feature of leveraged products is their downward returns bias, which arises from the compounding effect of leveraged returns. As these financial instruments aim to magnify the daily performance of the underlying asset, fluctuations over time can lead to underperformance compared to the asset's cumulative return. The compounding effect can cause the leveraged product to lose value \u2013 even when the underlying asset returns to its initial level.\n\nFor instance, suppose Bitcoin Futures (the underlying market for BITX) and BITX are both currently trading at $100. If the futures fall by 10% in a day, BITX itself can be expected to fall by 20% on that day. This brings the price of the futures contract to $90 and the price of BITX to $80. If on the subsequent day, Bitcoin Futures rise by 11.1%, the price of the future goes back to the original price of $100. However, BITX rises by 22.2% which brings its price to $97.76 \u2013 still short of the original price of $100 by 2.24%. This negative performance bias can compound significantly over time. This is explained in the below visual. The phenomenon is more pronounced in volatile markets, making leveraged products better suited for short-term trading.\n\nAs of July 17, the fund has assets under management to the tune of $22.5 million. Much like other digital assets funds, it too has a high expense ratio of 1.85%.\n\nSpot Price-Based Crypto ETFs\n\nThe SEC was rigorous in rejecting crypto spot ETF proposals. Its concerns centred around the regulation of underlying Crypto Spot exchanges leading to market manipulation and liquidity issues.\n\nHowever, recently SEC started accepting applications from several leading fund houses, including Blackrock, Fidelity, Vaneck, WisdomTree, and Bitwise for US crypto spot ETFs. While the formal approval process may take some time to be completed, it\u2019s clear change is coming. What\u2019s more, Europe is ready to launch the first ever spot price based crypto ETF.\n\nAfter a delay forced by the crypto winter of 2022, Jacobi Asset Management has now announced the launch of Europe\u2019s first Bitcoin ETF. Registered in Guernsey, the new ETF will expose investors to actual shares, unlike previous crypto products.\n\nThe sequence of events has brought around renewed optimism into the crypto market, pushing bitcoin and related investment vehicles higher. Still, traders in the perpetual futures market tied to bitcoin remain risk averse, unwilling to take on high leverage.\n\nDespite bitcoin holding the $30,000 mark for quite some time now, data tracked by Blockware Solutions show the ratio of open interest in BTC perpetual futures to bitcoin's market cap has been locked in a narrow range around 1.5% since late June. The ratio remains well below the high of 2.6% seen in September last year. The ratio is a popular indicator of the risk appetite of the investors. A stagnant ratio indicates money has been slow to flow into the market despite the Bitcoin price rise.\n\nAnother metric that can be used to gauge investor risk sentiment is the estimated leverage ratio (ELR), which estimates the amount of leverage in use on average. The ELR has dropped significantly since September 2022 and has stayed in the same ballpark since May 2023. Despite the apparent bullishness (owing to the news of launch of new products), investors and traders remain cautious and have not increased their leverage, even with Bitcoin inching higher.\n\nSimilar products were also launched in other countries, including Canada, Brazil, and Dubai. But they received limited investor attention. The average assets under management (AUM) of a few of the earliest and largest Canadian crypto spot ETFs has changed over time, and it shows the same pattern: optimism when products are launched followed by a period of dull growth and poor performance.\n\nNo Hedge, No Edge\n\nA major reason for investors flocking to Crypto products has been the belief that they can provide a reasonable hedge against equity and inflation. However, the correlation of crypto returns with both US CPI and the Morningstar Global Markets Index shows massive swings on both sides. This suggests a lack of conclusive evidence to support the notion that crypto-exposed products could serve as a reliable hedge against inflation or equity volatility.\n\nFool\u2019s Gold?\n\nMany investors and influencers have comparied crypto and gold, drawing parallels between the emergence of gold investing in the 1970s and the modern rise of crypto. Back then, gold was a largely unregulated asset and the launch of gold products and ETFs in subsequent years helped its adoption as a reliable alternative asset by conventional investors.\n\nTheir hypothesis is crypto should be thought of as a commodity, and that, much like gold, the launch of mainstream crypto products will help with the mainstream adoption of crypto too. However, gold does provide an established hedge against both equity and inflation. The chart below shows that, during any major equity market correction, Gold has risen to the mark and worked as a perfect hedge. Crypto, on the other hand, has shown no such benefits. We believe cryptocurrencies should not be identified as an asset class or as a commodity. Why? Because it has no fundamental features that resemble either.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nData suggests the optimistic turn of events has had almost no significant impact on investor outcomes. Crypto investors still seem to be concerned with the challenges the space represents, especially the volatility and the regulatory uncertainty around it. Perhaps the launch of the spot ETF is not as revolutionary as is being portrayed to be. Even if it is, few recent crypto products have lived past their initial hype, so this one may suffer the same fate.\n\nAs such, it is important investors take a long-term perspective and are prudent about market conditions. We believe retail investors are better off waiting on the sidelines to see if these products see the light of the day and can garner enough traction, let alone convincing performance. Thorough due diligence is very important, because there is simply more to lose than to gain."

        "content": "Weekly cryptocurrency asset flows for the week ending Aug. 4 reconciled at $107 million in outflows, continuing a three-week negative trend totaling $134.8 million.\n\nOnce again, the lion\u2019s share of movement was attributed to Bitcoin (BTC). With $111 million in outflows, Bitcoin funds negated the majority of inflows for the week.\n\nAccording to CoinShares\u2019 \u201cDigital Asset Fund Flows\" weekly report, this indicates further \u201cprofit taking\u201d on the heels of the previous cycle\u2019s gains. For the month leading up to the recent spate of outflows, inflows of $742 million into crypto funds were seen, with 99% of that coming into Bitcoin.\n\nWeekly crypto asset flows. Source: CoinShares\n\nWeekly trading volumes in investment products saw a dip below the year-to-date average, according to the report, with broader on-exchange market volumes down 62% against the relative average.\n\nRegionally, only Australia and the United States showed inflows, with $0.3 million and $0.2 million incoming, respectively. The largest regional outflows came from Canada, with $70.8 million, and Germany, with $28.5 million.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s outflows, the weekly total was somewhat buoyed by inflows into Solana (SOL) in the amount of $9.5 million, up from last week\u2019s total of $0.6 million in inflows. XRP (XRP) investment products also saw inflows of $0.5 million.\n\nEther (ETH) funds continue their negative trend, adding $5.9 million in outflows to the previous week\u2019s $1.9 million. This entirely offsets prior inflows in the amount of $6.6 million and further separates it from Solana\u2019s current bullish trend.\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains up for the year compared to its opening in January, many experts believe some of the perceived sideways movement that\u2019s kept it mostly beneath $30,000 since April is due to market uncertainty.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, data from Switzerland-based investment adviser 21e6 Capital AG shows that Bitcoin \u201chodlers,\u201d those who held funds in BTC, outperformed crypto funds by 69% in the first half of 2023.\n\nThe 2022 implosion of FTX and regulatory and legal uncertainty for numerous other exchanges may have tempted crypto fund investors to increase the amount of cash on hand versus invested funds, thus causing the current decay.\n\nThe report from 21e6 Capital AG did note that investor sentiment currently appears to be slightly up versus the first half of 2023.\n\nRelated: European digital asset manager CoinShares\u2019 revenue up 33% in Q2"

        "content": "In recent weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a significant price correction, with the leading cryptocurrency struggling to reclaim the $30,000 psychological threshold it surged past earlier this year.\n\nDespite a sharp upswing fueled by growing institutional interest earlier this year, the cryptocurrency\u2019s inability to maintain its gains has raised concerns and left investors closely monitoring the volatile market.\n\nRather than the flagship digital asset moving upwards, it appears that there\u2019s a 50% chance that BTC will crash as low as $25,000 before the end of September, according to leading investment manager Timothy Peterson tweeted on August 7.\n\nHowever, such a drop would mark the last major dip before Bitcoin embarks on the next, long-awaited bull run, the investor added.\n\n\u201cThere is a 50% chance that bitcoin will drop below $25,000 before the end of September. This would be the last big dip before the next big bull run cycle commences.\u201d \u2013 Peterson wrote in the tweet.\n\nSeptember, Bitcoin\u2019s worst-performing month\n\nPeterson\u2019s remarks on a possible drop in BTC price next month are based on the crypto coin\u2019s historical performance.\n\nNotably, as evident from the below image, September is by far the least favorable month of the year for Bitcoin in terms of price performance.\n\nOver the past 7 years, the only time Bitcoin saw positive price gains in September was in 2016, when it rose 6.4%. On the flip side, from 2017 to 2022, BTC was in the red every time during this month, with its losses ranging from -2.95% to -13.8%, Peterson\u2019s table shows.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historical performance per month. Source: Timothy Peterson\n\nHowever, October is one of the best-performing months for the biggest crypto coin. Since 2010, the only occasion when Bitcoin recorded a negative price change in this month was in 2018, when it fell by 4.5%.\n\nNovember and December marked mixed price performance for Bitcoin in previous years, although it is worth noting that some of its sharpest price drops came during the former month.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the time of publication, Bitcoin was changing hands at $28,989, almost unchanged in the past 24 hours.\n\nOver the past week, BTC lost 1% of its value, while its monthly loss currently stands at 4%.\n\nBTC 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nYear-to-date, however, BTC\u2019s gains remain strong at around 75%.\n\nOn August 4, pseudonymous crypto market analyst TradingShot highlighted that Bitcoin completed the third-ever golden cross pattern, which serves as a long-term bullish price signal.\n\nAccording to the expert, the previous two occasions where Bitcoin completed this pattern led to strong price rallies for the maiden cryptocurrency.\n\nThe prediction is somewhat in line with Peterson\u2019s comments that while Bitcoin may struggle with some near-term pressure, the long-term outlook currently looks promising for the biggest crypto asset.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

It\u2019s called cryptocrim.com, a space where all the crypto criminals will be thrown into Room 101, a place where you can consign anything you hate to history (although George Orwell had other ideas).\n\nThe new site will be live soon and the reason for launching this site is that, after so many crypto scams and rip-offs, I\u2019ve decided to keep a shortlist of updates of those that are the worst or the greatest. The list will include Celsius, TerraUSD-Luna, FTX, MtGox, Three Arrows Capital, Quadriga, OneCoin and more \u2026 but, as it\u2019s just starting, let\u2019s begin with bitcoin Bonnie and crypto Clyde.\n\nWho?\n\nA married couple nicknamed \u201cBitcoin Bonnie and Crypto Clyde\u201d have pleaded guilty to laundering $4.5 billion (\u00a33.5bn) in stolen cryptocurrency.\n\nMore detail emerges:\n\nHeather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein were arrested in New York last year after police linked their lavish lifestyle to a crypto heist, in what the US Justice Department called its \u201clargest financial seizure ever\u201d. The Justice Department managed to recover \u00a32.8bn out of the stash of some 120,000 bitcoin, which is today worth \u00a33.5bn. Prosecutors said the pair stole the bitcoin in 2016 using \u201cadvanced hacking tools\u201d.\n\nAs part of a deal, the pair pleaded guilty to money laundering, while Lichtenstein admitted to being behind the hack and Morgan pleaded guilty to an additional count of conspiracy to defraud the US.\n\nDespite her moves to hide her crimes, Morgan masqueraded as a rapper and tech entrepreneur who called herself a \u201cbad-ass money maker\u201d and \u201cthe crocodile of Wall Street\u201d in her lyrics.\n\nHeather and husband Ilya were running a crypto scam firm called Bitfinex. Folks investing bitcoin in Bitfinex did not know that the couple converted the investments into US dollars clearly in the light of day. It was purely a hack flow where money went directly from the firm into their pockets. The pair also purchased gold coins and set up shell companies to make the bitcoin funds look legitimate.\n\nSo, how did they get found out?\n\nWell, they accidentally exposed themselves by using a gift card paid for with the stolen funds from Bitfinex, when paying for goods in a Walmart supermarket.\n\n\u201cPolice were able to link the Walmart gift cards back to some of the proceeds of the Bitfinex hack, which then opened up the further investigation,\u201d said Jonathan Levin, founder of cryptocurrency investigators Chainalysis, who participated in the investigation.\n\nAmazing.\n\nI guess there are two questions:\n\n1) How did they get away with it?\n\nProsecutors claimed the couple used fake identities to create online accounts and disguise their trail of transactions by depositing and withdrawing the stolen funds from virtual exchanges and darknet markets.\n\n2) Why Bonnie and Clyde?\n\nThere are few couples who have made headlines in quite the same way as Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. The two criminals are known for a series of bank robberies, murders, and kidnappings that took place between 1932 and 1934, the height of the Great Depression.\n\nSo, welcome to 2023 where bitcoin Bonnie and crypto Clyde strike again."

        "content": "A cryptoasset specialist says a bitcoin rally could be forming due to anticipation for the cryptocurrency\u2019s next \u2018halving\u2019 event, which is expected to take place next year.\n\nPeter Habermacher, chief executive of London-based cryptoassets investment specialist Aaro Capital, says that historical data shows a crypto bull market typically commences more than a year before a bitcoin halving.\n\nA bitcoin halving event is anticipated to happen next in April/May 2024 and results in the rate of bitcoin supply being halved.\n\nCrypto has historically followed an approximately four-year market cycle, with \u201cexuberant and parabolic market peaks followed by severe and painful bear markets\u201d, writes Habermacher in an article.\n\nCrypto market cycles have \u201croughly\u201d followed Bitcoin\u2019s halving events, meaning the market is now approaching the end of another cycle, according to Habermacher.\n\nHe says that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is increasing again \u2013 a sign that the major cryptocurrency is recovering from a bear market. Historically bitcoin has recovered first from bear markets, but it tends to lag other cryptocurrencies in the later stages of a bull run.\n\nOne data source that has evidenced this in the past is blockchain data, which Habermacher says provides the ability to recognise patterns and behaviours of blockchain users via their transactional data. He writes that current data is consistent with previous crypto market cycles.\n\n\u201cIf the crypto market evolves in a similar way as previous market cycles, we can have increasing confidence that we are in the transition phase out of the 2022 bear market and into the next crypto bull market.\u201d\n\nFurther data from technical analysis \u2013 which indicate prices that traders and investors are happy to buy at \u2013 also suggests that \u201cgreener pastures\u201d are ahead, as there has been a clear change in the behaviour of market participants, who are \u201cexhibiting early bull market behaviour.\n\nIn his article, Habermacher also mentions other market factors to watch, which on the negative side, include bottlenecks at service providers.\n\n\u00a9 2023 funds europe"

        "content": "BlackRock, a multinational investment company, shocked many in the cryptocurrency industry in June when it filed an application for an exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Bitcoin Trust. It\u2019s seeking to overcome 10-year-long opposition from United States regulators to cryptocurrency ETFs. A spot Bitcoin ETF would be tradable on a traditional stock exchange and track with the market.\n\nWhile supporters argue that ETFs are tax-efficient, easy to trade and cheap, BlackRock\u2019s approach is arguably misguided. It is important to keep in mind that ETFs do not have the same focus or goals as Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nProblems with the traditional finance sector\n\nThe traditional finance sector has long been dominated by institutions that control the flow of capital and dictate the terms of finance. Many people feel disenfranchised by these institutions, feeling they have restricted access to wealth creation, developing barriers for individuals and small businesses.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nTherefore, the arrival of cryptocurrencies presented a significant opportunity to offer an alternative to the traditional finance system that promises increased autonomy, inclusivity and transparency. However, merging traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) is critical for mass adoption.\n\nBitcoin ETF next deadline August 13th\n\n\n\n(But this is for the ARK re-filing)\n\n\n\nLikely gets postponed IMO while most eyes will be watching Sept 2nd for BlackRock ETF deadline\n\n\n\nBlackRock likely the first approved, if any, as the rest are just re-filing pic.twitter.com/h2ESr6aMnp \u2014 Rager (@Rager) August 5, 2023\n\nWe need to move toward an industry where DeFi can serve legacy financial institutions rather than view them as targets. Major banks and players want to get into crypto, but there is also a potential for the general public to enter this new world in the future and address the many limitations or barriers associated with the traditional finance sector. The arrival of ETFs represents the financial industry\u2019s attempts to integrate the innovation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs promote centralization\n\nThere are many different kinds of cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular are centralized exchanges \u2014 like FTX. Centralized exchanges hold the private keys to their clients\u2019 wallets, and they generally require users to undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) process to help curb illicit and illegal activities.\n\nDecentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, by contrast, are built atop a decentralized, noncustodial blockchain system that supports direct peer-to-peer transactions. This approach essentially removes the need for intermediaries. Users do not have to complete the KYC process \u2014 which means people living under repressive governments have an opportunity to participate. They also maintain autonomy over their private keys and are solely responsible for the security of their funds \u2014 which they can stake to earn interest.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t be naive \u2014 BlackRock\u2019s ETF won\u2019t be bullish for Bitcoin\n\nCrypto\u2019s ability to offer these advantages \u2014 especially to unbanked users who are unable to access traditional banking services \u2014 is the entire point of the industry.\n\nETFs, on the other hand, are inherently centralized products, creating a conflict with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They offer none of the advantages that comprise the foundation of cryptocurrency, nor do they encourage new users to become involved.\n\nIn addition to undermining Bitcoin\u2019s core principles of decentralization and trustless transactions, ETFs also introduce the problem of \u201cpaper\u201d Bitcoin \u2014 BTC that exists only on paper. With no ability to withdraw the \u201cBitcoin\u201d you supposedly own, the prospect of FTX-style catastrophes arising in the future becomes much likelier.\n\nWe need to demystify cryptocurrency \u2014 not create a \u201cCrypto for Dummies\u201d fund\n\nMost people do not grasp the basics of Bitcoin, nonfungible tokens or cryptocurrencies in general. It\u2019s critical that those of us who are in cryptocurrency identify a comfortable entry point into the crypto world for the general public to engage. Demystifying cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin will lead to broader adoption. Transforming Bitcoin into an easily tradable asset could dilute its role as a revolutionary decentralized currency.\n\nTraditional finance should be leveraged as a stabilizing force. Its structures could potentially offer stability to the volatile crypto market. If implemented properly, they could provide security, accessibility and trust, and even attract more mainstream investors to cryptocurrencies. Strict regulatory oversight could also legitimize Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies for the general public and financial institutions.\n\nThere is a huge need for evolution in traditional finance. Institutions must adapt and evolve to fully embrace cryptocurrencies. They should incorporate the ethos of decentralization and autonomy that cryptocurrencies represent rather than simply integrating Bitcoin into existing structures. And that means BlackRock should consider putting the kibosh on its Bitcoin ETF.\n\nDaniele Servadei is the co-founder and CEO of Sellix, an e-commerce platform based in Italy.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

These combined factors are fostering an environment of caution and uncertainty among crypto investors.\u201d\n\nIn a breath of positivity for investors, Curve Finance recovered $52.3 million, or around 73% of the stolen US$73.5 million, on-chain intelligence firm PeckShield announced on Monday. But the first Curve-ETH exploiter has still not returned the remaining US$19.7 million worth of crypto.\n\nIn the crypto market, the XRP token was the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, after it fell 3.3% in the past 24 hours to US$0.6139, followed by Solana\u2019s SOL token that declined 1.3% to US$23.08.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.31% to US$1.16 trillion while market volume increased 12.95% to US$22.69 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nForkast 500 NFT index refreshes all-time low, Bitcoin NFT sales start recovery, Ethereum NFT sales extend declines\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index slipped 0.49% to 2,441.81 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and fell 3.76% during the week. The index declined to an all-time low of 2,438.71 points earlier today.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales continued last week\u2019s decline, falling 17.79% to US$424,710 with the network slipping to the seventh largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales declined 13.06% to US$10.23 million, but sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 56.98% to US$697,324. CryptoPunks sales also rose 53.80% to US$177,238.\n\n\u201cNFT sales have fallen for five months straight so far, and last year around this time we had a six-month stretch that ran from April to October before we finally started to see an uptick in sales,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nIn the wider NFT space, Web3 game developer nWay revealed new gameplay of its upcoming NFT game Wreck League, which is developed in partnership with Yuga Labs and Animoca Brands. The game is expected to launch in the coming weeks, with both a Web2 and Web3 version.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast CAR NFT Composite was the only one in the green for the day.\n\nAsian equities fall, U.S. stock futures rise ahead of U.S. inflation data\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities declined as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, except Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225. Yet, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posted declines.\n\nInvestors were anticipating the release of China\u2019s trade figures for last month, with concerns that both exports and imports could extend declines due to a lack of domestic and overseas orders.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all strengthening.\n\nTraders remained cautious ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data for July, scheduled for Thursday, as this can also signal the path for further interest rate decisions.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are now anticipating earnings from companies like Palantir, BioNTech, Lucid Group, Paramount Global and Beyond Meat.\n\nEuropean equities fell on Monday, extending last week\u2019s declines, with the Dax losing 0.4% and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling below 460 as markets mulled remaining quarterly earnings.\n\nSee related article: Standard Chartered\u2019s great expectations for Bitcoin in 2024\n\nUpdates with equities section"

Market watchers will closely monitor the July CPI Inflation data and Jobless Claims figures on Thursday. Friday will bring insights from the July PPI Inflation and Consumer Sentiment data.\n\nMoreover, this week will feature three Federal Reserve members speaking and approximately 15% of S&P 500 companies reporting their earnings.\n\nDe-Risking from MakerDAO\n\nOn the bearish side, concerns persist about stablecoins, particularly DAI. On-chain analysis indicates that a16z, a long-time MakerDAO investor, sold their last MKR holdings last week, leading to speculation that significant events may be on the horizon.\n\nThere are also signs of de-risking from MakerDAO by Circle or related entities, as the amount of USDC backing the DAI in circulation has significantly decreased in recent weeks. It might explain the selling pressure on USDC. These concerns could affect DAI and USDC, leaving GUSD and USDT in focus. GUSD had a hard time holding its peg due to 83% of it being used to back DAI, while USDT faces speculative possibilities surrounding regulatory issues.\n\nPossible DOJ Charges against Binance\n\nOne concerning story from this week is the report that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is contemplating filing criminal fraud charges against Binance. Moreover, there is concern that doing so could trigger a run on the exchange. Despite already facing lawsuits from the SEC and CFTC, criminal charges would be a significant escalation.\n\nBase And Meme Coin Mania\n\nOn the bullish side, Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer 2, Base, is set to launch publicly. The ability to bridge crypto both ways may create increased demand for ETH and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAdditionally, there might be a resurgence of meme coin mania on Base, as observed on the platform so far. It\u2019s worth noting that some of these meme coins are rug pulls, and how Coinbase handles such issues will be intriguing. Barring any regulatory warnings or interventions, Base could potentially achieve the same level of success as BNB did in its early days. As always, DYOR!\n\nPositive Catalyst from Hong Kong Crypto Exchanges\n\nAnother positive catalyst comes from the recent approval granted to two crypto exchanges, Hashkey and OSL, to serve retail investors in Hong Kong. Initially, they will reportedly offer BTC and ETH. Hashkey may also include USDT and USDC, which is surprising given the regulator\u2019s stance on stablecoins being off-limits to retail investors. The restriction is likely to prevent capital flight from the mainland, a concern shared by China\u2019s new central bank governor.\n\nDespite these promising developments, the current low Google Search Trends for Bitcoin and Ethereum in Hong Kong suggest that retail investors are not actively buying BTC and ETH yet. However, the situation could change swiftly if another bullish catalyst emerges.\n\nFor now, bearish catalysts dominate the market, with many of these concerns centered around DeFi platforms.\n\nCurve Saga\n\nLast week, Curve Finance, a prominent DeFi protocol, experienced a significant setback with panic selling and withdrawals hitting hard. In just 48 hours, the TVL in Curve dropped by 50%, going from $3.2 billion to $1.6 billion, and its native CRV token saw a sharp decline of over 30%, falling from $0.73 to $0.50.\n\nThe catalyst for this crisis was a hack that exploited a dormant zero-day vulnerability present in older versions of Vyper, a third-party EVM contract-oriented, Pythonic programming language utilized by Curve and other DeFi protocols.\n\nHow Did It Happen?\n\nThe attack unfolded in two stages. On July 30th, hackers exploited pools on Curve, including Alchemix (alETH), Pendle (pETH), CurveDAO (CRV), and Metronome (mSETH), stealing around $70 million worth of assets. Following this, the CRV/ETH pool faced a second attack, capitalizing on the broken balances left behind by the initial exploit. It allowed the hackers to exchange CRV for most of the remaining ETH in the pool.\n\nImpact on the DeFi Ecosystem\n\nThe ramifications of the Curve Finance exploit extended beyond the protocol itself, impacting the broader DeFi ecosystem. It was partially due to the $100 million loan taken by Curve\u2019s founder, which was secured using the platform\u2019s native Curve DAO token. Fortunately, a white hat hacker, c0ffeebabe.eth, intervened and returned approximately $5.4 million to Curve by front-running one of the attacker\u2019s transactions.\n\nControversy and Aftermath\n\nThe losses from the exploit amounted to nearly half of the approximately $70 million in stolen assets, primarily originating from the CRV/ETH pool.\n\nPlease note that this reentrancy issue is associated with the use of 'use_eth', which could potentially place the WETH-related pools in jeopardy! @CurveFinance , please DM us if you need any help. https://t.co/vjc1RRce7w pic.twitter.com/Wz8DXJZK7Y \u2014 BlockSec (@BlockSecTeam) July 30, 2023\n\nBesides, security firm BlockSec identified and tweeted about the vulnerability in the CRV/ETH pool approximately two hours before the attackers took advantage of it. As a result, some individuals, including Curve founder Michael Egorov, have accused BlockSec of assisting the attackers by publicly disclosing a live exploit. In response, BlockSec defended its actions, stating that its intention was solely to alert users about the new issue so they could safeguard their funds.\n\nDespite BlockSec\u2019s purported good intentions, whether this was the most appropriate course of action remains debatable.\n\nThe Real Threat \u2013 Egorov\u2019s Loan\n\nHowever, we cannot attribute Curve\u2019s rapid loss of confidence solely to the exploits. In perspective, the $70 million exploit affected less than 4% of Curve\u2019s TVL at the time of the incident.\n\n1/ Yesterday, several @CurveFinance pools were exploited. Curve founder, Michael Egorov, currently has a ~$100M loan backed by 427.5m $CRV (about 47% of the entire CRV circulating supply). With $CRV down 10% over the past 24 hours, the health of Curve is in jeopardy. \ud83e\uddf5\u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/EKpQCkDs6W \u2014 Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) August 1, 2023\n\nThe actual threat arose when users realized the potential cascading effect on the price of CRV, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s \u201csleeping dragon\u201d at risk \u2013 a $100 million loan secured by $427.5 million worth of CRV.\n\nEgorov\u2019s CRV collateral constitutes approximately 47% of the entire circulating supply of CRV. If the token\u2019s price were to drop, Egorov\u2019s loans across lending platforms like Aave, Fraxlend, Inverse Finance, and Abracadabra could face liquidation. This situation would introduce even more volatility into the broader DeFi ecosystem, as the bad debt would burden many of these lending platforms due to the illiquidity of CRV tokens.\n\nThe Irony of Egorov\u2019s Bailout\n\nTo avert the risk of liquidation and further volatility, Egorov swiftly took action. He executed a series of Over-The-Counter trades to repay a portion of his loans. Additionally, he created a new liquidity pool on Curve for FraxLend\u2019s CRV/FRAX market, incentivizing users to lend FRAX and reducing the CRV/FRAX utilization rate by rewarding CRV to those participating.\n\nThe Curve OTC War updates: 17.5M CRV to 0xf51\n\n5M CRV to Justin Sun\n\n4.25M CRV to DCFGod\n\n2.5M CRV to Ox4d3\n\n2.5M CRV to DWF Labs\n\n2.5M CRV to Cream: Multisig\n\n1.25M CRV to 0xcb5\n\n3.75M CRV to machibigbrother.eth\n\n250k CRV to 0x9bf \u2014 Sandra (@sandraaleow) August 1, 2023\n\nWhile Egorov\u2019s measures have temporarily prevented liquidation and alleviated further volatility, the situation where other major whales in the DeFi space bailed him out is reminiscent of scenarios often witnessed in traditional finance. Ironic, right?\n\nLet\u2019s look at on-chain data.\n\nMore Sideways Movement Ahead?\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nIt has been more than 840 days since the bull market\u2019s peak in April 2021. Interestingly, the current recovery in 2023 is showing some promising signs compared to the last two cycles. The market is trading at -54% below its all-time high, an improvement from the historical -64% drawdown experienced in previous cycles.\n\nNotably, the 2015-2016 and 2019-2020 cycles saw six months of sideways movement and boredom before the market eventually accelerated above the -54% drawdown. This observation suggests that a similar period of monotony may be on the horizon.\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nDespite a blazing start to 2023, quarterly and monthly price performances have cooled off. This pattern is reminiscent of prior cycles where the initial rally off the bottom was robust but followed by an extended period of choppy consolidation.\n\nBitcoin analysts often refer to this phase as the \u201cre-accumulation period.\u201d During this time, the market is characterized by uncertainty and erratic movements as investors re-evaluate their positions and wait for new catalysts to emerge.\n\nLong-Term Holders Still HODLing?\n\nAt the end of June 2023, the Bitcoin network experienced a notable spike in mature spending, a trend commonly observed during bull markets. Long-term coin holders who have held their coins for more than 155 days seize opportunities amid a strengthening market to take advantage of favorable conditions.\n\nHowever, the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (Binary CDD) is showing muted activity due to low spending. Such low spending is typically associated with bearish phases of Bitcoin and a weakening market.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term, Binary CDD is a binary value. If the Supply-Adjusted Coin Days Destroyed (Supply-Adjusted CDD) is higher than the average Supply-Adjusted CDD, the Binary Coin Days points to \u20181\u2019. Otherwise, it points to \u20180\u2019. This indicator shows whether long-term holders move their coins more or less than average.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nA high density of \u20181\u2019 values indicates that long-term holders are moving their coins, potentially signaling their intent to sell. On the other hand, \u20180\u2019 values indicate a period when mature coins are less inclined to move, typically observed during a scaling bull market in Bitcoin. Long-term holders often take advantage of lower Bitcoin prices to accumulate more coins during such times.\n\nThe theory behind this indicator suggests that long-term coin holders may be apprehensive about the current state of the crypto industry in the absence of a scaling bull market. As a result, they may choose to wait out the uncertainty and keep most of their coins in cold wallets for the time being.\n\nPower of BTC Price Growth On The Decline\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nIn supply and demand dynamics and market making, exchanges are crucial as significant entities in the cryptocurrency market. Alongside on-chain data, examining the behavior of actors on exchanges is one of the best methods to assess market conditions.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThree essential factors for Bitcoin\u2019s price growth and bullish speculation by exchange participants are worth considering:\n\nThe Outflow Mean from the spot market The Inflow Mean of stablecoins to exchanges The Trading Volume of Bitcoin on exchanges\n\nAll of these reflect the necessary liquidity in the market.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nIn July, all three of these factors experienced a simultaneous decrease, indicating a decline in liquidity, which is essential for facilitating another price jump. The reduction of necessary liquidity based on these criteria can lead to temporary or mid-term adjustments in the market. Therefore, monitoring the overall liquidity trend in the coming days is paramount for market participants.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Low Volatility and Its Implications\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nIn 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s realized volatility across various observation windows, ranging from 1-month to 1-year, has significantly decreased, reaching multi-year lows. Particularly, the 1-year volatility window is now at levels not seen since December 2016. It marks the fourth instance of extreme volatility compression in Bitcoin\u2019s history, which has historically been infamously volatile.\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nThe current price range between the 7-day high and low is merely 3.6%, and only 4.8% of all trading days have experienced a tighter weekly trade range. Similarly, the 30-day price range has been extremely constricted, with just a 9.8% band over the last month, and only 2.8% of all months have been tighter. These tight ranges indicate a prolonged period of consolidation, a rare occurrence in the notoriously volatile Bitcoin market.\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nThis quiet spell extends to derivatives markets for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Futures and options trade volumes for these assets are at or approaching all-time lows.\n\nMarket\u2019s Risk-Off Stance and Shifting Dominance in Futures Markets\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nAdditionally, the market is currently displaying a relatively risk-off stance, as evidenced by Bitcoin\u2019s increasing dominance within futures markets. Between 2021 and 2022, Ethereum futures markets saw a steady rise in trade volume and open interest, surpassing Bitcoin and peaking at a 60 BTC:40 ETH split in H2-2022.\n\nHowever, in the present year, the scales have tilted back in favor of Bitcoin, indicating a shift in sentiment towards the leading cryptocurrency. This trend suggests that lighter liquidity and a reduced risk appetite motivate investors to move capital towards assets perceived as lower-risk, ultimately pushing Bitcoin\u2019s dominance higher in futures markets.\n\nOptions Market and the Volatility Crush in Bitcoin\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nLooking at the options markets, it becomes evident how severe the volatility crush has been, as implied volatility across all contract expirations has collapsed to all-time lows.\n\nBitcoin markets are notorious for their high volatility, with options trading at implied volatility levels ranging from 60% to over 100% for most of 2021-22. However, options are currently pricing in the smallest volatility premium in history, with implied volatility (IV) ranging between 24% and 52%, less than half of the long-term baseline.\n\nThis significant drop in implied volatility raises an intriguing question. Considering that fewer than 5% of all trading days have experienced a similar price range contraction, it suggests that Bitcoin may no longer be as infamously volatile as it once was\u2014or it could imply that volatility is currently being mispriced in the market.\n\nTraders Embrace Volatility, but Recent Drop in Trade Volume Indicates Low Volatility\n\nSource: Kaiko\n\nCurrently, both BTC and ETH are experiencing 180-day volatility at multi-year lows, with percentages of 46% and 49%, respectively.\n\nBTC began the year trading at $17k and had seen its gains slow down considerably compared to previous bull markets when it experienced rapid surges over short periods. Similarly, ETH, which has historically been much more volatile than BTC, is now exhibiting similar sluggishness in its price movement.\n\nThe market\u2019s present state is remarkably subdued, prompting questions about whether heightened volatility lies ahead. With both BTC and ETH experiencing multi-year low volatility, traders are closely monitoring the situation to determine the potential direction and magnitude of future price movements.\n\nTrade Volume Continues To Fall\n\nSource: Kaiko\n\nDespite Bitcoin experiencing a remarkable surge of 75% in 2023, the trade volume in the cryptocurrency market has continued to decline. Almost all exchanges witnessed double-digit decreases in trade volume in July compared to the previous year. A collapse in long-term volatility accompanies this trend, indicating that overall market participation remains low.\n\nAmong the exchanges, U.S. platforms saw the most substantial drop in volume, averaging around an 80% decrease. However, Coinbase, benefiting from a flight to quality after the SEC lawsuit against Binance.US, experienced a comparatively smaller decline in trade volume than the broader crypto market.\n\nSource: Kaiko\n\nNevertheless, last week, Coinbase\u2019s earnings call disclosed a strong decline in altcoin and institutional trading, suggesting that the adverse regulatory environment and bear market have impacted the exchange\u2019s performance. A steady increase in the share of BTC trading on the platform mirrors this shift in trading behavior. In Q2, BTC trading rose to 40%, up from 32% in Q1, reaching its highest level since Q4 2020.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "title": "The Rise Of Bitcoin: A Game-changer In Finance - Dataconomy",
        "content": "The pioneering cryptocurrency has captivated the financial world since its inception in 2009. Its revolutionary impact on finance cannot be understated, as it ushered in the era of decentralized digital currencies.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the journey of Bitcoin and how it has transformed the financial landscape, becoming a game-changer in the world of finance.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a revolutionary technology called blockchain, a distributed ledger system that ensures transaction transparency, security, and immutability. Unlike traditional fiat currencies,\n\nBitcoin is not controlled by any central authority, making it truly decentralized. Its limited supply of 21 million coins contributes to its deflationary nature, contrasting the inflationary tendencies of fiat currencies. Transactions conducted with Bitcoin are pseudonymous, adding an extra layer of privacy.\n\nEarly adoption and growth\n\nIn its early days, Bitcoin faced skepticism from the financial industry and regulators alike. However, as its benefits became evident, it garnered attention from tech enthusiasts and libertarians who recognized its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems.\n\nEarly adopters utilized Bitcoin for various transactions, from online purchases to remittances and cross-border transfers. The rise of Bitcoin exchanges and secure wallets facilitated the buying and selling of cryptocurrency, enabling users to participate in this digital financial revolution.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s impact on finance\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of Bitcoin has been its contribution to financial inclusion. With traditional banking services often inaccessible to millions around the globe, Bitcoin offered a decentralized alternative for the unbanked population to access financial services, empowering them economically.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s borderless nature has facilitated faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, reducing the reliance on costly remittance services. The investment and speculative aspects of Bitcoin cannot be ignored either. As the cryptocurrency gained prominence, a thriving market emerged, offering investors an opportunity to diversify their portfolios.\n\nThe era of Bitcoin witnessed the emergence of mobile-friendly trading platforms like bitcoin bank, utilizing sophisticated technologies to easily and efficiently buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\n\nChallenges and controversies\n\nDespite its rapid growth, Bitcoin has faced its fair share of challenges and controversies. Governments and regulatory bodies have grappled with how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies, leading to uncertainty and fluctuation in the market. The highly volatile nature of Bitcoin\u2019s price has also been a point of concern for investors and mainstream financial institutions.\n\nSecurity remains a critical issue, with hacking incidents and scams impacting user confidence. The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which requires substantial energy consumption, has raised debates about its sustainability in the long run.\n\nBitcoin as a store of value and digital gold\n\nOver time, Bitcoin has evolved from being just a means of exchange to being viewed as a store of value, often called \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Its finite supply and scarcity have led some investors and institutions to consider it a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. Consequently, Bitcoin has gained traction in mainstream finance, with companies and institutional investors integrating it into their investment strategies.\n\nThe role of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin has paved the way for the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. DeFi leverages blockchain technology to provide financial services without intermediaries, offering features like decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and smart contracts.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature has inspired the development of DeFi applications, further expanding the potential of blockchain technology in the financial domain.\n\nCentral Bank digital currencies (CBDCs) vs. Bitcoin\n\nAs Bitcoin continues gaining prominence, central banks worldwide have been exploring introducing their digital currencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs aim to combine the benefits of digital currencies with the control of a central authority.\n\nWhile CBDCs may offer advantages in terms of faster and more efficient transactions, they differ significantly from the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.\n\nFuture prospects and challenges\n\nThe Bitcoin era is expected to witness further technological advancements as we look to the future. Solutions like the Lightning Network and layer 2 protocols aim to address Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Regulatory clarity, mainstream adoption, and environmental sustainability remain significant hurdles for cryptocurrency to overcome.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin has truly been a game-changer in finance. From its humble beginnings, Bitcoin has disrupted traditional financial systems, offering a decentralized alternative for the unbanked and empowering users with financial sovereignty.\n\nDespite facing challenges and controversies, its potential as a store of value and investment asset cannot be ignored. As the Bitcoin era continues, it will be exciting to witness its ongoing evolution and potential to shape the future of finance and beyond.\n\nFeatured image credit: Pierre Borthiry \u2013 Peiobty/Unsplash"

        "title": "Buying Bitcoin Spark in the ICO is similar to early Shiba Inu before it skyrocketed, analyst claims - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) emerges into the crypto scene with exciting offers making the crypto onboarding process easier. Its ICO, featuring one BTCS at $1.50 and bonuses to boost it, appeals to investors with its affordable entry price. According to crypto watchers, buying Bitcoin Spark during its ICO phase is akin to getting in early on Shiba Inu before its meteoric rise.\n\nBitcoin Spark\n\nBTCS is running an exciting ICO, leaving investors to imagine buying Bitcoin when it was $1 or investing in SHIB at its early stages. Furthermore, early investors expect up to 800% returns by investing in BTCS\u2019 first phase. The project will launch at $10 as the project seeks to maintain similar Bitcoin tokenomics.\n\nBitcoin Spark deploys an all-new \u201cProof-Of-Process\u201d blockchain technology (PoP), combining various aspects of PoS and PoW. This Bitcoin fork runs on Ethereum and strives for speed and scalability, which are lacking in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Spark takes the best of both worlds and introduces a new way of validating transactions through PoP. Users in the Bitcoin Spark network can similarly stake their coins to a PoS blockchain, providing a financial stake in the network\u2019s security and integrity. Additionally, they can contribute their processing power to perform PoW tasks as part of the consensus process. This innovative approach ensures that the network remains decentralized and secure while achieving high efficiency in transaction validation.\n\nBy leveraging PoP, Bitcoin Spark aims to address scalability and transaction costs, two critical challenges many cryptocurrencies face, including Bitcoin. The network\u2019s ability to process several transactions quickly and cost-effectively makes it a more practical choice for everyday use. This process is made possible by a Bitcoin Spark application, which can also act as a wallet for cryptocurrency-safe custody. The app supports Android, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Windows.\n\nFurthermore, the PoS and PoW combination in Bitcoin Spark creates a balanced ecosystem where users are incentivized to hold and stake their coins for security and governance purposes while actively contributing to the validation process. This dual approach fosters a healthier and more inclusive network, reducing the risk of centralization and enhancing overall decentralization. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s use of the innovative Proof-Of-Process mechanism and its integration of PoS and PoW elements set it apart from other cryptocurrencies in the market. With its focus on scalability, cost-effectiveness, and security, Bitcoin Spark is positioning itself as a promising digital currency with the potential to address the challenges of the original Bitcoin network and become a key player in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nShiba Inu price\n\nThe current Shiba Inu price hovers around $ 0.0000086 with a circulating supply of 589 trillion SHIB and a 24-hour trading volume of $227,769,724. Prospective investors can buy Shiba Inu at the prevailing Shiba Inu price on top exchanges.\n\nWill Shiba Inu go up?\n\nThe Shiba Inu ecosystem has tried several measures in the hope of developing real use cases for this meme coin. Recent developments indicate an impending Shibarium launch, with the team optimistic of a price rise. However, Shiba Inu price and any other cryptocurrency are subject to various factors, including market sentiment, adoption, technology developments, and overall market conditions. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and if you are considering investing in Shiba Inu or any other cryptocurrency, it\u2019s essential to research, understand the risks, and make informed decisions based on your situation.\n\nWrap Up\n\nBitcoin Spark (ICO presents an opportunity similar to Shiba Inu\u2019s early days before its meteoric rise. With its unique blockchain technology and the integration of innovative features, Bitcoin Spark is an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking to participate in the cryptocurrency space and capitalize on its innovative features and potential for growth.\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin investment was more profitable than crypto hedge fund in H1 2023 - Technext",
        "content": "A new report has shown that investors would have benefited more from buying and holding Bitcoin than investing in crypto hedge funds during the first half of 2023.\n\nAccording to a research report from Swiss-based crypto investment adviser 21e6 Capital, the classic buy-and-hold approach to Bitcoin outperformed most crypto funds by 68.8% in the first six months of the year.\n\nThis is largely due to the fact that bitcoin was one of the best-performing crypto assets in the first half of 2023, seeing massive gains from prospects of the SEC approving a Spot Bitcoin ETF. The price of Bitcoin started the year around $15,500 and climbed to over $31,400 in July.\n\nCrypto hedge funds gather money from investors to invest in crypto projects, including blockchain ventures, derivative projects, and multiple other digital asset industry projects. In other words, they are investment vehicles that gather capital from multiple investors intending to secure higher investment returns.\n\nRead also:\n\nUSDT issuer, Tether reports a total excess reserve of $3.3 billion in Q2 2023\n\nInvestors typically join a hedge fund because it is easier to bear the high management costs and brave the risks of investing in a hedge fund. The scheme has proven to be a profitable venture for players in the space in the past, and it is interesting to discover how the tides turned in favour of the typical Bitcoin investment in the first half of the year.\n\nThe 21e6 report\n\nThe Switzerland-based investment adviser 21e6 Capital AG report says on average, crypto funds generated returns of 15.2% in the first half of 2023, but bitcoin saw gains of around 84%.\n\n\u201cAll crypto fund strategies achieved positive results this year. But relative to Bitcoin, they underperformed, especially those with significant exposure to altcoins, to futures, or those strongly dependent on momentum signals.\u201d \u2013 the 21e6 report.\n\nIn the report, 21e6 Capital AG\u2019s head of marketing, Maximilian Bruckner, outlined that crypto hedge funds have been \u201cfrequently able to significantly outperform Bitcoin in previous bull runs.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe attributed much of the underwhelming performance of crypto hedge funds in 2023 to the challenging market conditions and their significant cash in late 2022.\n\nFollowing the implosion of FTX and other crypto projects in 2022, the report suggested that many crypto funds opted to take fewer risks, therefore missing out on a significant BTC price rally in H1 of 2023.\n\nThe report adds:\n\n\u201cFunds with large cash positions will underperform Bitcoin in a bull market unless the funds\u2019 assets perform significantly better than Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cDue to the general sentiment left behind by the end of 2022, many funds had larger-than-normal cash positions. Furthermore, most major altcoins also underperformed Bitcoin \u2013 a tough environment for funds.\u201d\n\nHow FTX closure made crypto hedge funds underperform\n\nDue to the sudden closure of the multibillion-dollar crypto exchange FTX in November, crypto hedge funds struggled. Persistent challenges stemming from the FTX bankruptcy affected the performance of crypto hedge funds. The fallout from the crisis has even forced the closure of some crypto funds.\n\nRead also:\n\nWith a 83% gain, data shows Bitcoin was more profitable than every other asset in H1 2023\n\n21e6 Capital tracks more than 700 crypto funds globally, as well as the regulatory performance reports of 123 funds across 70 firms, and the firm reports that the underperformance has led to the closure of about 97, or 13%, of those crypto hedge funds. For instance, crypto investment firm Galois Capital with $40 million worth of assets trapped in the FTX exchange, announced its closure in February.\n\nAlso, the closure of three crypto-friendly banks earlier this year and the continued turbulence around potential regulations contributed to the decline. Following the FTX crisis, many banks adjusted their approach to the crypto sector as a whole. Under increased regulatory scrutiny, previously crypto-friendly banks cut off ties with crypto hedge funds.\n\nIn conclusion, FTX was a prominent crypto derivatives exchange for hedge funds. But now that there is still no clear alternative to take its top position, crypto hedge funds are expected to struggle, at least in the near term."

        "title": "Kaspa Reaches New Record High, but Analysts predict that this Bitcoin Fork could outpace KAS - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Kaspa\u2019s native token (KAS) recently achieved a new record high of $0.04844, signifying an impressive recovery after the industry dip when SEC sued Binance and Coinbase exchanges. However, analysts place Bitcoin Spark in a position to outpace Kaspa, given its innovative features and unique approach.\n\nHow to mine Kaspa?\n\nMining Kaspa involves using a computer\u2019s processing power with a powerful CPU or GPU to mine efficiently. Before you start, get a Kaspa wallet to store your mined KAS coins securely and download mining software compatible with Kaspa\u2019s algorithm, like Kaspaminer. You can join a Mining pool to combine your mining power with others and increase your chances of mining a block. Rewards are shared among pool members. Set up the mining software with your Kaspa wallet address and pool information. Kapsa mining consumes energy, so factor in electricity costs and adjust your strategy to ensure profitability.\n\nCan Kaspa reach 1 dollar?\n\nKapsa has been on a recovery path after dropping to $0.0136 when the SEC struck. The current KAS supply is 19,984,392,840, with a market cap of about $915 million. To achieve a value of $1, the Kaspa token would need to grow by nearly 40 times. This would result in a market cap of $19 billion, which is uncertain. It could become certain if 50% of the coins were burned.\n\nBitcoin Spark (BTCS)\n\nBTCS comes with a new and innovative blockchain technology deviating from the original BTC\u2019s Proof-of-work. Bitcoin Spark utilizes a new-to-market Proof-Of-Process (PoP) protocol, setting it on the course of addressing Bitcoin challenges. PoP combines the staking elements of Proof-of-Stake and the processing power of Bitcoin\u2019s PoW. Users can stake their coins while also contributing processing power to the network for PoW tasks. This unique approach pursues true decentralization, security, and efficiency within the BTCS network.\n\nBitcoin Spark deploys a revenue generation model enabling users to rent out their computing power and helps create a decentralized and self-sustainable ecosystem. BTCS introduces diversification by advertising within the application to support network operations.\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s tokenomics are structured in such a way that they implement a more gradual and controlled distribution of tokens over time. As such, the attainment of maximum supply is extended, hence deviating from BTC, though they share similar tenets like capped token supply at 21 million.\n\nThe Bitcoin Spark ecosystem includes a user-friendly application for seamless interaction with the network. Users participating in mining receive rewards for providing processing power. The rewards distribution mechanism ensures a fair and balanced approach, considering stake and work done in the network. Mining power rental involves availing processing power and allowing individuals to participate without the need for expensive and energy-intensive mining rigs.\n\nBitcoin Spark currently running phase one of its exciting ICO. Imagine buying Bitcoin when it was only 1$. Bitcoin Spark gives you that chance. BTCS is priced at $1.50, giving you a chance to realize 800% gains when the project launches at $10. In addition, you enjoy 20% in bonuses for each order you complete.\n\nWrap Up\n\nKaspa\u2019s recent surge mirrors Bitcoin Spark\u2019s ICO as a formidable player. Bitcoin Spark offers a promising alternative by introducing innovative blockchain technology and addressing cryptocurrency challenges.\n\nMore info on Bitcoin Spark and ICO here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Police are warning the public after an individual in Adelaide Metcalfe lost $35,000 in Bitcoin to scammers who had posed as Microsoft representatives over the weekend.\n\nAccording to Middlesex County OPP, at 8:37 a.m. on Aug. 7, police officers were dispatched to a residence in Adelaide Metcalfe where an individual reported being the victim of fraud.\n\nPolice said the victim had received a pop-up alert from Microsoft indicating that an update was ready for their computer with directions to call a provided phone number.\n\nThe victim called the number and was told the firewall was expired and that payment was required.\n\nThe victim then purchased and installed a fake firewall.\n\nThe next day, another individual posing as a Microsoft representative called the victim to confirm everything was working well, at which time police said the victim granted control of their computer to the scammers, including their banking information.\n\nThe fraudsters then advised the victim that they inadvertently transferred funds into the victim\u2019s account, and demanded the money be paid back in Bitcoin.\n\nPolice said the victim complied and transferred the fraudsters approximately $35,000 in Bitcoin.\n\nOPP remind the public that scammers create confusion and chaos during interactions, leading victims to react impulsively. They advise that any unsolicited requests should be verified before providing personal information, and if feeling pressured, people should hang up the phone or delete the sender\u2019s profile.\n\nThe investigation continues."
