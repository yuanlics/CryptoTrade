        "title": "Bitcoin is terrible for the environment \u2013 can it ever go green? - The Guardian",
        "content": "On the corner of New York\u2019s Park Avenue and 52nd Street, curious onlookers recently stopped in front of a giant green skull sitting in the bed of a truck parked outside the office of Fidelity Investments, the global financial management company.\n\nThe \u201cSkull of Satoshi\u201d, named after the pseudonymous bitcoin developer Satoshi Nakamoto, is composed almost entirely of computer circuit boards and fitted with tall smokestacks usually found atop coal power plants.\n\nThe artifact is a project of artist Benjamin Von Wong and is a reference to the massive amounts of carbon emitted from mining the cryptocurrency bitcoin, an endeavor Fidelity is now pursuing.\n\nBitcoin is chiefly known as a wild investment vehicle that \u2013 along with many other cryptocurrencies \u2013 can seemingly make or lose fortunes overnight in a market where values go up and down quickly and by large margins.\n\nBut what worries environmentalists and others is the huge amount of electricity used in generating bitcoin and other such currencies \u2013 energy that often traces back to fossil fuels and so has a corresponding impact on the climate crisis.\n\nAs major financial brands speculate in the cryptocurrency world, environmental campaigners want to make sure they know that they are not just taking a financial gamble; there is also an environmental risk.\n\nSome are hoping that they can persuade those institutions to try to lessen the impact of crypto-mining. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step for a financial institution like Fidelity to launch their own crypto platform. So now more than ever, we need their help,\u201d said Rolf Skar, campaign director at Greenpeace USA, a non-profit environmental advocacy organization.\n\nIt is a complex situation. But here is a guide to the key issues.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, a decentralized form of currency that is strictly digital rather than physical \u2013 unlike dollars, pounds or euros. It is managed and traded on a public, open ledger known as a \u201cblockchain\u201d that records all bitcoin transactions. Though not commonly done, bitcoin can be used to buy material goods.\n\nHow does bitcoin cause environmental damage?\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are not centralized, there is no singular authority or body to verify transactions. Instead, participants in the bitcoin network \u201cmine\u201d, or compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to generate more of the currency. Whoever solves the puzzle the fastest gets to verify transactions for the chance to add the newest batch of them to the blockchain.\n\nThe winner is financially rewarded with new cryptocurrency in this process, referred to as \u201cproof of work\u201d (PoW) \u2013 the culprit for greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe PoW consensus algorithm used to verify transactions requires large amounts of electricity which is often produced by burning fossil fuels, emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.\n\nA 2022 report, titled Revisiting Bitcoin\u2019s Carbon Footprint, conducted by climate and economics researchers across Europe estimates that \u201cBitcoin mining may be responsible for 65.4 megatonnes of CO 2 per year \u2026 which is comparable to country-level emissions in Greece (56.6 megatonnes in 2019).\u201d\n\nWhat do environmental groups want?\n\nThere is a recent push by some environmentalists to reduce the environmental impact of bitcoin by changing the way it is produced.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Greenidge Generation bitcoin mining facility, in a former coal plant by Seneca Lake in Dresden, New York. Photograph: Ted Shaffrey/AP\n\nSo groups such as Greenpeace are calling out Fidelity and other financial management and payment process companies that have ventured into bitcoin mining. Hence the recent targeting of Fidelity. Skar said that although Fidelity responded to Greenpeace when the group reached out, the response was lackluster.\n\n\u201c[Fidelity] seem not to want to talk about the issue. They declined [our request to speak] so far, but it\u2019s an invitation for them and others to step up and put resources towards solutions to deal with the problem of bitcoin mining globally. We think it can be done,\u201d Skar said.\n\nHow could \u2018changing the code\u2019 mitigate environmental damage?\n\nThe solution, Greenpeace argues, is simple: change the computer code that produces bitcoin in order to consume less electricity and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nThis code is open-source, meaning it is publicly accessible to anyone who wants to see or use it.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fidelity is the focus because they have been one of the biggest traditional financial players involved in the bitcoin space and they refuse to acknowledge that they have a responsibility and the ability to help fix the problem that bitcoin mining is having on the climate. So this is actually an invitation for them,\u201d Skar said.\n\nHe called the code change \u201ca win for bitcoin and for climate and for communities\u201d.\n\nBut would it succeed?\n\nProminent voices in the bitcoin community and some scholars on the topic don\u2019t buy into this solution.\n\nDr Hanna Halaburda is an associate professor of technology, operations and statistics at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business. Among the classes she teaches are Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies and Foundations of Fintech.\n\nIn reference to a hypothetical bitcoin protocol change, Halaburda said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work. Everybody recognizes [bitcoin] is environmentally unhealthy, but any big changes to bitcoin protocol have been very unsuccessful because you need to get all the miners to agree on that.\u201d\n\nAny miners that don\u2019t agree with the protocol change can simply reject the new code and continue running the original code that relies on the energy-intensive PoW.\n\nWould other tactics work?\n\nHalaburda said there might be another solution: renewable energy.\n\n\u201cA lot of [bitcoin] mining companies have set up their contracts with renewable energy companies. The argument is that having these mining facilities as clients means that when there\u2019s an oversupply of energy, it may actually make it more profitable for the renewable energy plants,\u201d she said.\n\nThis means that these energy companies can mine bitcoin during periods of excess production and oversupply. So instead of letting energy go to waste, money can be made and the wealth can be shared between the cryptocurrency mining facilities and the renewable energy companies with which they have a contract.\n\nFidelity did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment."

        "title": "How Ordinals Make Bitcoin Both Fungible and Non-Fungible (Correct) - Bloomberg Law",
        "content": "Bitcoin is generally understood to be a fungible virtual currency\u2014each unit of bitcoin is exactly the same as any other unit of bitcoin and can be exchanged or transacted over the Bitcoin protocol on a like-kind basis.\n\nIn contrast, non-fungible tokens refer to a subset of digital assets that represent ownership of unique pieces of intangible digital content such as digital art, avatars, or even music. NFTs are typically minted or issued independently of a fungible base-layer digital asset such as Bitcoin or Ether. The underlying blockchain network recognizes each NFT as different from one another. In other words, one NFT cannot be exchanged for another NFT on a like-kind basis.\n\nHowever, the fungible and non-fungible worlds of digital assets have collided with the recent emergence of Bitcoin Ordinals\u2014also known as Ordinal Inscriptions. Bitcoin Ordinals, enabled by a 2021 upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol named Taproot, allow Bitcoin holders to \u201cinscribe\u201d permanently the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or satoshis, with unique digital content of up to 4 megabytes.\n\nDespite continued regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets, Bitcoin Ordinals have generated significant interest in recent months, contributing to a surge in Bitcoin transaction fees in early 2023. According to recent media reports, more than 500,000 Bitcoin Ordinals have been \u201cminted\u201d or issued on the Bitcoin blockchain to date. The rising popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals even reportedly sparked developers of other virtual currencies to incorporate similar features on their respective blockchain protocols.\n\nSimultaneously Fungible and Non-Fungible\n\nUnlike traditional NFTs, Bitcoin Ordinals give Bitcoin both fungible and non-fungible properties.\n\nFor instance, unlike an NFT issued on the Ethereum blockchain, the Bitcoin protocol does not recognize a satoshi inscribed with unique content as being different from any other satoshi. A holder of a Bitcoin Ordinal therefore is free to exchange their satoshi for another, and may even spend the inscribed satoshi to pay for transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. In this way, Bitcoin Ordinals preserve the fungible nature of Bitcoin and behave as any freely exchangeable virtual currency would.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin Ordinals can also behave much like NFTs as digital collectibles, as they may be bought or sold for their unique inscribed content\u2014which has included in one instance a fully functional video game. This attribute gives the Bitcoin Ordinals value independent of the Bitcoin virtual currency. Several third-party NFT marketplaces have reportedly launched platforms to facilitate the trading of Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nBecause digital content inscribed on a satoshi is permanent, Bitcoin Ordinals may be used as a virtual currency in one transaction and as an NFT in another, forever fluctuating between the two use cases. Whether a Bitcoin Ordinal makes the underlying satoshi fungible or non-fungible therefore depends on how the holder decides to use it.\n\nRegulatory Implications Are Unclear\n\nThe duality of a digital asset that is simultaneously fungible and non-fungible potentially raises challenging regulatory questions surrounding the characterization of the digital asset under the federal securities laws. No US regulator has to date formally addressed the ability of a historically fungible digital asset to morph into an NFT and vice versa.\n\nFor example, it is unclear whether a unit of a digital asset that was once issued as a security ceases to be a security if the same unit of the digital asset is later sold in a non-fungible capacity as a digital collectible. Such a scenario may be akin to a decades-old rare coin being sold at an auction as a valuable piece of memorabilia, where the utility and the market value of the rare coin is completely divorced from its face value.\n\nConversely, it is also unclear how regulators might characterize the morphing digital asset if it is subsequently redeemed as a fungible token in the secondary market. To continue the rare coin analogy, this would be akin to the rare coin being put back into general circulation for its originally intended use, namely for purchase of goods and services.\n\nWhile the regulatory treatment of an instrument may change over time depending on the relevant facts and circumstances, it is unclear how such an approach would practically apply to a digital asset that continuously morphs between a fungible token, and one that is as unique as a piece artwork such as the Mona Lisa.\n\nIt may be too early to tell whether this latest trend in the world of digital assets will stick for good. However, innovations in the digital asset space continue apace, often pushing the boundaries of existing regulatory frameworks and challenging regulators to devise creative solutions to adapt.\n\nThe article has been corrected to reflect that Bitcoin transaction fees surged in early 2023.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Industry Group, Inc., the publisher of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg Tax, or its owners.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nDaniel Davis is partner and co-chair in Katten\u2019s financial markets and regulation practice.\n\nAlexander Kim is an associate in Katten\u2019s financial markets and regulation practice.\n\nWrite for Us: Author Guidelines"

        "content": "Bitcoin has been one of the hottest topics of conversation in the world of investing over recent years with many desperate to understand what it is all about and whether you can make money from Bitcoin . However, it\u2019s not just about investing in the cryptocurrency - there\u2019s also the option of mining Bitcoin.\n\nMoney.com recently published a helpful article on whether mining Bitcoin is profitable and, here, we summarize it for you.

For more help, you can also listen to me and other prominent journalists describe the pros and cons of Bitcoin mining in last week\u2019s episode of The Week Unwrapped podcast .\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nIt\u2019s worth first establishing what Bitcoin actually is, given it is a highly complex type of currency. I have been in the world of personal finance journalism for almost 20 years and I must say it\u2019s the most complex issue I have written or spoken about.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

According to the Economist, \u201ca blockchain is a database made up of a string of blocks of information that build on top of one another in an immutable chain. It stores data on transactions, providing proof of who owns what at any time.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized currency, meaning it is not under the control of any state or central bank.\n\nAs you may know, the value of Bitcoin can be very volatile. While one coin is worth about $30,000 at time of writing, in the past three years or so it\u2019s swung between $5,000 and $65,000. In addition, there have been some safety concerns, as crypto hackers have stolen billions of dollars in the past. Meanwhile, recent bankruptcies in the industry have also raised questions for investors.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining?\n\nIn its simplest terms, Bitcoin mining is when you create new Bitcoins, though how you get there is fairly complex.\n\nAccording to Bankrate , \u201cBitcoin mining is the process of creating new Bitcoins by solving extremely complicated math problems that verify transactions in the currency. When a Bitcoin is successfully mined, the miner receives a predetermined amount of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMoney.com goes into even more detail: \u201cMiners are competing to guess a complex 64-digit number known as a hash. To guess the hash, miners use powerful computers to generate guesses quickly. Think of it this way: each digit in the hash has 16 possibilities (the digits 1 through 10 plus letters A through F). So, to generate a guess, you could roll a 16-sided die 64 times. That would give you one guess \u2014 the problem is, there are trillions of possible answers.\n\n\u201cUsing tons of processing power and a whole lot of energy, miners\u2019 computers basically roll that die at super speeds. The miner who arrives at the correct hash first and adds a bitcoin block to the blockchain receives the reward.\u201d\n\nHow do you actually set up a Bitcoin mine?\n\nThe first thing to note is that it is legal in the U.S., even though some other countries have placed restrictions on Bitcoin mining.\n\nTo mine Bitcoin, you need giant computers capable of processing the huge amount of data required, and that can cost you thousands of dollars to set up. The enormous amount of hardware required has led some people to join mining pools to share computing power, though it also means they share any gains.\n\nA friend of mine has taken up Bitcoin mining, and when I went to his house a few weeks ago, I saw about four giant computers, each about the size of an old-fashioned hi-fi system. They gave off a tremendous amount of heat - so much so that he installed solar panels to cover the electricity cost of mining, though it means he hardly had to turn on the heating in winter, he said.\n\nImportantly, the huge energy consumption required is one reason Bitcoin mining is controversial, because of the environmental impact.\n\nHow much money can you make from Bitcoin mining?\n\nThis is where we return to the article run by Money.com to summarize its advice.\n\nIt points out that every time a miner adds a new block of transactions to the blockchain, they earn 6.25 Bitcoin, but this will drop to 3.125 next year. It is paid into a crypto wallet.\n\nThat equates to a lot of money given the value of Bitcoin at time of writing was about $30,000 per coin. That may sound like easy money, but remember: you are competing against other miners.\n\nLet\u2019s also remember that Bitcoin is an incredibly volatile currency, so who knows what the value will be tomorrow, let alone the distant future. There have been some days where Bitcoin investors have woken up to giant falls and rises in its value.\n\nIs it profitable, then? Here is how Money.com summarizes that answer: \u201cThe bottom line is that there is no set amount bitcoin miners earn. Mining requires significant investment, and the results are unpredictable.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, it takes a lot of investment to set up, you are using a lot of energy to mine and the returns are unknown. Of course, some make huge sums from Bitcoin mining, but before you take the plunge, consider the risks, the environmental impact and the effort involved."

Ether fell about 1% to $1,835.88.\n\nEarlier in the day, bitcoin jumped as much as about 8% and briefly reclaimed the $30,000 level. That helped lift ether, which advanced more than 6% at one point to about $1,950.\n\nBitcoin had been trading sideways for several days, with volatility back to its lows of early March, before the banking crisis began and became one of the cryptocurrency's biggest upward catalysts this year. Beginning late Tuesday, troubles at First Republic helped drive the cryptocurrency's price action again, according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management.\n\n\"Crypto rallies during banking crises, and it looks like the banking crisis may not be over,\" Hougan said.\n\nFirst Republic shares fell almost 30% Wednesday, bringing its two-day loss to about 80%, after reporting a massive drop in deposits in the first quarter as customers pulled their money out following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. CNBC's David Faber reported that the next few days are crucial for the company, as other banks and federal officials seek to pull together a rescue plan."

        "title": "Exploring Bitcoin, digital coins that exist only online - Spectrum News",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency's most famous coin \u2014 Bitcoin \u2014 has been a big newsmaker recently, some good and some bad. It's still very new and relatively unknown. There's a lot of questions about cryptocurrency and debate about protection.\n\n\u201cMy opinion is that this is probably the biggest value driver that I've seen in my lifetime outside of the internet,\u201d said Jeremy Knopp, principal of CryptoHedge, a private hedge fund dealing in cryptocurrency, who helps institutions and accredited investors navigate this new world.\n\nOut of college, Knopp became fascinated with the idea of cryptocurrency and crypto assets, that it became his life.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with the technology side, as well as the investment capabilities,\u201d he added. \u201cI think there's a lot of people that don't know where to start, frankly, because the information is overwhelming.\u201d\n\nHis father-in-law, Doug DeMarche, is like many Americans. Maybe his neighbor or his friend made some money in Bitcoin, but other than that, he doesn't know much about it.\n\nSo DeMarche, who wants to get started in investing, is seeking Knopp's help.\n\n\u201cI think most people now realize the growth potential and the asymmetric upside risk. You know, there's also a lot of noise out there,\u201d Knopp said.\n\nSo Knopp suggests people start from the beginning and learn the basics. Think of it like a digital gold, he said. He believes most people have probably heard of a few of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Etherium, Dogecoin and, of course, Bitcoin.\n\nThey are digital coins that exist only online. They can be traded like a stock, and in some cases, can be used to make real-life purchases.\n\n\u201cThere has been, literally, no better investment that you could have made from 2009 to 2022 than Bitcoin,\u201d Knopp said.\n\nWhen you buy Bitcoin or any other crypto, you are actually buying a digital code that exists only on the Bitcoin blockchain. You access this code through a private key to a digital wallet that only you hold.\n\n\u201cI see blockchain technology and, you know, this kind of disintermediation of value as being that next wave of technology,\u201d he added.\n\nThe technology is known as blockchain, in essence, a digital accounting book, or ledger. Blockchain is an open source, decentralized, shared-with-everyone, digital ledger. It records transactions and tracks assets 24/7 and in real time. It is tamper-resistant, while also removing the nodes, the middlemen that we often see in finance and business, reducing the risk of foul play and fraud and also cutting the costs, the fees of that middleman.\n\nMany people who don\u2019t mine, use nodes \u2014 a third party \u2014 to acquire the coin.\n\n\u201cIt provides a lot of efficiency. It provides a lot of technological capability outside of what exists today,\u201d Knopp added.\n\nEfficiency that is now disrupting banking and finance, gaming and even music.\n\nCanadian rock band Our Lady Peace, who recently performed a private show in Syracuse, released its latest album as an NFT, a non-fungible token, a digital asset that allowed the band to skip the traditional record label, make the music it wanted to and sell the album \u2014 and extras \u2014 directly to fans and not pay the label fees.\n\n\u201cSo you remove all those middle layers, which has always been a hindrance to creators in terms of distributing, monetizing but also community-building,\u201d Our Lady Peace lead singer Raine Maida said, adding the blockchains ability to track asset transactions, allows creators to earn royalties every time an NFT or other creation on the chain sells from fan to fan.\n\n\u201cEspecially from new artists that are kind of unproven and trying to make a name for themselves. They have to accept terms that are not very advantageous for them,\u201d Knopp added.\n\nThat is what he means when he says changing the game.\n\nBut for as much as some love the idea of what crypto can be, others are not as certain. In the third part of this series, Spectrum News 1 takes a look at the questions many have, the scandals that have sprouted and the balance between a decentralized concept and a possible need for government regulation."

His sentencing is scheduled for July 17.\n\nInside the U.S. Federal Court House in Concord, New Hampshire, approximately 35 people came to support DiMezzo during her sentencing \u2013 Freeman among them.\n\n\u201cAria is an amazing person who has a ton of good people in her life who support her,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nNBC10 Boston Ian Freeman outside of the courthouse in Concord, NH to support Aria DiMezzo during her sentencing.\n\nDiMezzo and her attorney Richard Guerriero were pushing for a one-year home confinement sentence, arguing the only wrongdoing was not having a license, which is why she pleaded guilty only to that charge.\n\nFederal prosecutors argued DiMezzo should receive 30-37 months in prison, citing the sentencing guidelines for the nature of the crime. Prosecutors also showed a video clip of DiMezzo giving a presentation about how to sell bitcoin and instructing viewers not to ask about why someone might want to buy it. They argued this video proved her actions were \u201cmore aggravated than simply not getting a license.\u201d\n\nDiMezzo gave a statement regarding her belief in financial privacy, saying she did not believe what she was doing was illegal or harming anyone being scammed.\n\nRegarding her statement about financial privacy, Judge Joseph Leplante said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter, the harm is still the harm.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the 18 month sentence, DiMezzo forfeited $14,000 and almost two bitcoin, worth about $55,000. She was also ordered to pay a $5,000 fine and will have a one-year supervised release after serving her sentence.\n\nDiMezzo's supporters were hugging and crying after the decision.\n\nAndrea Madison, general manager of Domino\u2019s in Keene, where DiMezzo works as an assistant general manager, was in tears.\n\n\u201cIt hurts,\u201d Madison said. \u201cWe\u2019re losing a very dear friend for 18 months, so it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nDiMezzo lives in Keene.

        "title": "'Bitcoin Could Skyrocket to $100,000,' According to Standard Chartered \u2014 Here Are 3 Stocks to Take Advantage - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin failed to fulfil one of its purposes last year as a hedge against soaring inflation, but it came into its own recently via another original purpose \u2013 as a bet against the legacy banking system. Its decentralized and trustless attributes have made the leading crypto one to hold against a backdrop of multiple bank collapses. In fact, delivering gains of 70% though Q1 made it the quarter\u2019s best performing asset.\n\nAnd it has got plenty more room to run, says Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at British banking giant Standard Chartered. \u201cWe see potential for Bitcoin to reach the $100,000 level by end-2024, as we believe the much-touted \u2018crypto winter\u2019 is finally over,\u201d Kendrick noted.\n\nThat\u2019s a gain of 240% from current levels, a surge that will be hard to find elsewhere. For many, though, buying bitcoin directly still represents somewhat of a complicated act but there are ways to get skin in the game without directly purchasing the asset. The stock market presents opportunities with many names operating in the bitcoin ecosystem \u2013 miners in particular \u2013 and their performance naturally correlates with that of the daddy of crypto. Hence, if bitcoin is set to surge so will many bitcoin-themed stocks.\n\nWith this in mind, we delved into the TipRanks database and pulled up the details on 3 crypto stocks poised to make use of that anticipated run. What\u2019s more, all 3 are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nCleanSpark, Inc. (CLSK)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with CleanSpark, a bitcoin miner that sometime ago decided bitcoin mining was where it\u2019s at. While once the company specialized solely in microgrid solutions, it began dabbling in mining operations toward the end of 2020. However, since then, mining endeavors have become its main priority.\n\nCleanSpark oversees its own mining operations in Atlanta, Georgia and co-locates miners in Massena, NY. Bitcoin is famous for being hugely energy intensive, but the company likes to highlight its credentials as a sustainable player, mining the bulk of its BTC with renewable or low-carbon energy sources. By often selling its mined bitcoin, the company has funded expansion and last year, even as the crypto winter raged, increased its hashrate \u2013 the measure of the computational power used to mine the asset \u2013 from 2.1 EH/s in January to 6.2 EH/s at the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has set its sights on bringing that hashrate up to 16.0 EH/s by the end of 2023, and recent purchases will go toward making that goal a reality. The company recently announced a purchase of 45K new Antminer S19 XP machines that when eventually deployed will almost double the current hashrate.\n\nAccording to H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese, the company exhibited some canny business nous when securing the deal which comes roughly two months following the company\u2019s purchase of 20,000 Bitmain rigs for a 25% discount.\n\n\u201cCLSK secured the machines for a very attractive $23/TH (before applying coupons), the lowest we\u2019ve seen in the market for these rigs, and 12% below the going rate for high efficiency ASICs (under 25 J/TH), based on Luxor\u2019s Bitcoin ASIC Price Index,\u201d the analyst explained.\n\n\u201cManagement has been very opportunistic in acquiring new mining rigs at rock bottom prices over the past year, which we believe will drive significant shareholder value, and with this latest purchase, the company has now secured 99%, or 15.9 EH/s of the miners required to reach its year-end 2023 hash rate target of 16 EH/s\u2026 We continue to view the stock as significantly undervalued relative to fundamentals,\u201d Colonnese added.\n\nOverall, CLSK shares have soared 98% year-to-date, but Colonnese sees ample growth ahead. Calling CLSK a \u2018top pick,\u2019 the analyst rates the shares a Buy while his $12 price target makes room for 12-month returns of a whooping 194%. (To watch Colonnese\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThis bitcoin miner has garnered two other recent reviews and both are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The $8.33 average target might represent a more modest objective, but could still yield gains of a handsome 104% over the next year. (See CLSK stock forecast)\n\nHIVE Blockchain Technologies (HIVE)\n\nThe next bitcoin miner we\u2019re looking at is HIVE Blockchain Technologies. Fun fact: in 2017, HIVE became the first publicly traded crypto miner. The company actually got its start as a GPU-based miner of Ethereum but in 2020 it also began mining bitcoin and has expanded is operations since then. The company has a commitment to ESG practices and mines its bitcoin using green energy, making use of favorable power costs and renewable energy sources with mining operations in Canada, Iceland, and Sweden.\n\nTouting its BTC credentials, the company aims to foster long-term shareholder value with the OG practice of HODLing \u2013 keeping its bitcoin close to its chest.\n\nThat said, HIVE saw a big drop in its revenue stream in the most recent financial report \u2013 for its fiscal third quarter (December quarter). Revenue fell by 79% year-over-year to $14.3 million, which can be attributed not only to an increase in global hashrate and reduced cryptocurrency prices but also to Ethereum\u2019s switch to a proof-of-stake model. That said, the company mined 787 bitcoin during the quarter, amounting to a 13% year-over-year increase, while its average cost of production per BTC was $13,599. The current BTC price is more than double that.\n\nThe company also said that in order to maximize profitability, it intentionally pulled back on production and also repurposed some of its GPUs into non-mining endeavors.\n\nLooking at these activities, Canaccord analyst Joseph Vafi likes the way this firm operates. The 5-star analyst writes: \u201cWe see the current setup for HIVE as healthy on multiple fronts. We are encouraged by the company\u2019s efficient Bitcoin production, strong balance sheet, steady progress at its facilities, and prudent approach toward repurposing its GPU machines. Perhaps most importantly, at a macro level we believe that digital assets are biased higher in the medium term to long term, and especially Bitcoin, which has handled resistance relatively well in the face of recent market volatility\u2026\u201d\n\nThese comments form the basis for Vafi\u2019s Buy rating on HIVE, which is backed by a $7 price target. Even after posting year-to-date gains of a hefty 119%, investors stand to pocket returns of 134%, should this figure be met. (To watch Vafi\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nElsewhere on the Street, with two additional positive reviews in tow, HIVE claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of 57%, considering the average target clocks in at $5.33. (See HIVE stock forecast)\n\nIris Energy (IREN)\n\nBitcoin has its fair share of evangelists and two early adopters convinced in its value are the driving force behind are next BTC-flavored stock. Daniel and Will Roberts are the co-founders and co-CEOs of Sydney, Australia-based Iris Energy and used their background and expertise in renewable energy and traditional mining when setting off on their bitcoin mining activities.\n\nThe company operates in regions that have an abundance of renewable energy \u2013 wind, solar, hydro -and their locations are run on 100% renewables. Iris sticks to a simple plan: mine bitcoin, sell it and pay energy bills and overheads.\n\nHowever, the company ran into some issues last year, attempting to scale meaningfully at what turned out to be extremely bad timing. With crypto winter at its peak and the industry rocked by multiple scandals (Terra Luna, Celsius, FTX), bitcoin\u2019s price crashed. Against this backdrop, several mining firms over-leveraged, saw profits drop and were driven into insolvency.\n\nHowever, through prudent business practices, Iris seems to have weathered the storm. And for Compass Point analyst Chase White, the way the company has handled matters informs his bullish take.\n\n\u201cNow that IREN has restructured its balance sheet to eliminate virtually all of its debt, replaced the miners lost to its creditors because of the restructuring with no additional cash outlays, and is almost finished with its capex spend to get to 5.5 EH/s, we believe the company is very well positioned to start generating solid free cash flows at current BTC prices with the opportunity to invest in further growth if BTC prices rise further,\u201d White opined.\n\nIn fact, the lack of debt and the near completion of facility buildouts have \u201cderisked the story significantly,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nIREN shares have benefited immensely from bitcoin\u2019s surge and have posted growth of 260% since the turn of the year. However, White thinks there are plenty more gains in store. Along with a Buy rating, his $11 price target suggests the stock has room for additional growth of 144% in the year ahead. (To watch White\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nWhite\u2019s thesis gets the full backing of his colleagues here. The stock garners Buys only \u2013 4, in total \u2013 for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are expected to change hands for ~78% premium a year from now, considering the average target stands at $8.

Credit: Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\nApple may have fallen out of love with Bitcoin.\n\nIn April, an unusual bit of news made the rounds: Someone had hidden a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper in Apple's macOS, and it remained there for years and through multiple major versions of the OS.\n\nIt probably ends now, however. According to 9to5Mac, the latest beta version of macOS Ventura doesn't contain the file anymore.\n\nThe file, which was hidden inside a tool called \"VirtualScanner.app\" is nowhere to be found, and the entire VirtualScanner.app itself was removed, too. Besides the copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper, the file also contained a mysterious image, likely taken on Treasure Island in San Francisco, along with a few other files.\n\nSorry, you'll have to procure your copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper elsewhere. Credit: Satoshi Nakamoto/Apple\n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper was originally published by Bitcoin's mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2008. It contains a technical overview of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nFeatured Video For You Biden's crypto executive order is (finally) here\n\nWe may never find out why the Bitcoin whitepaper was hidden inside macOS in the first place. Given that it was fairly quickly expunged from the OS, it's likely that an Apple engineer thought it would be a cool idea, but Apple decided they don't want to be associated with Bitcoin in this way."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in the opposite direction of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro.\n\nThe negative correlation has strengthened, reversing the brief let-up witnessed in late March, and indicating the possibility of accelerated gains in the cryptocurrency in the case of a continued dollar slide following the release of the U.S. gross domestic product data on Thursday.\n\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the dollar index has slipped to a two-month low of -0.70, according to data from charting platform TradingView. It had weakened to -0.11 four weeks ago.\n\nCorrelations are measured on a scale of -1 to +1. Values skewed toward -1 indicate that lower prices for one variable are associated with higher prices for the other.\n\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient of -0.70 suggests a notably strong negative relationship between the two assets. (TradingView/CoinDesk)\n\nBitcoin and the DXY have been mostly negatively correlated over the past three years, except in times where crypto-specific factors overshadowed the dollar trends. For instance, bitcoin fell in late 2022 as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX kept investors from cheering weakness in the U.S. currency. A similar breakdown was seen in the lead-up to Coinbase's (COIN) Nasdaq debut in April 2021 and the launch of a futures-based exchange-traded fund in the U.S. the following October.\n\nFocus on GDP\n\nAt 12:30 UTC, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its preliminary estimate of first-quarter GDP. The data is likely to show the world's largest economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.0%, a slower pace than the 2.6% growth in the fourth quarter last year, according to Reuters estimates published by FXStreet.\n\nSeveral economic indicators and bond market metrics have been warning of a recession for months. The dollar index has declined by over 12% since early October in the hopes that the Federal Reserve would halt its interest-rate hikes and resort to liquidity easing to support the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nBesides, traders are back to pricing three interest-rate cuts by year end in the wake of issues at First Republic Bank (FRC), even though the Fed didn't cut rates and maintained a hawkish or anti-stimulus bias following the banking crisis episode of March.\n\nWith so much dovish expectations already in the air, the GDP figure might have to indicate a sharper-than-expected moderation in economic activity to trigger a deeper dollar sell-off and rally in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt also means that a upbeat figure may see markets price out rate cuts and lift the dollar higher.\n\n\"The market eyes growth at 2% \u2013 shouldn't move markets too intently given the backward nature of the data point \u2013 would need to be a big beat/miss to the move rates expectations and the USD, gold, Nasdaq,\" Chris Weston, head of research at foreign-exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said in a tweet.\n\nAt press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $29,010, up 2% in the past 24 hours. The dollar index was little changed at 101.50."

        "title": "Bitcoin in War: OP_RETURN Callouts of Russian Military Bitcoin Addresses Point to Blockchains\u2019 Growing Role in ... - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "The intersection of cryptocurrency and geopolitical conflict has been a growing topic over the last year. From nation state ransomware attacks, to U.S. National Defense Fellow Jason Lowery\u2019s Softwar thesis, many believe that cryptocurrency has a role to play in 21st century warfare. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has provided the best example of this to date, with both sides using crypto to solicit donations and finance the war effort. However, we recently discovered what appears to be an example of a more direct, aggressive usage of Bitcoin for counterintelligence, through the unprecedented weaponization of the OP_RETURN field. We\u2019ll explain below.\n\nMystery Bitcoin user labels nearly 1,000 addresses as Russian government assets in OP_RETURN transactions\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Russian state actors have embraced cryptocurrency. Chainalysis has written in the past about geopolitically motivated ransomware attacks carried out by Russian groups against Ukrainian targets in the leadup to the war, and since the invasion, pro-Russia groups have solicited millions in crypto donations. Additionally, Russia-based cybercrime syndicates like those under the Evil Corp umbrella have suspected links to Russian intelligence.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, it would be difficult to detect cryptocurrency addresses used by hostile actors unless you were actively looking for them. But starting on February 12, 2022 \u2014 weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and ending on March 14, 2022, an anonymous Bitcoin user sounded the alarm and called out nearly 1,000 addresses they claim belong to Russian security agencies. How did they do it? OP_RETURNs. OP_RETURN is a field used to store data in transactions, effectively allowing users to attach messages to transactions and broadcast them to the entire blockchain, where they\u2019ll be saved forever. OP_RETURNs also mark the transaction\u2019s output as invalid, meaning that any Bitcoin attached to an OP_RETURN transaction is gone forever. In this case, an individual or group sent thousands of transactions to a total of 986 unique Bitcoin addresses, claiming that these addresses were linked to Russian intelligence agencies. Here\u2019s what some of that transaction activity looks like in Chainalysis Reactor.\n\nEach transaction contained one of the four following messages, originally written in Russian:\n\n\u201cGRU to SVR. Used for hacking!\u201d\n\n\u201cGRU to GRU. Used for hacking!\u201d\n\n\u201cGRU to FSB. Used for hacking!\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp Ukraine with money from the GRU Khakir\u201d\n\nEach message claims the address in question was used in hacking operations by one of three Russian agencies: the Foreign Military Intelligence Agency (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and Federal Security Service (FSB). To make things even more interesting, most of the OP_RETURN messages originated from addresses that the OP_RETURN vigilante also said belong to the Russian government in other OP_RETURN messages. Assuming the vigilante\u2019s accusations are true, that would mean this individual accessed the private keys of Russian-controlled addresses, either through hacking or collaboration with an insider. In a series of transactions taking place in April 2022 \u2014 a few months after the others, and over a month into the invasion \u2014 the OP_RETURN vigilante sent funds held by what they claim to be a Russian-controlled address to a Ukrainian aid donation address, as indicated by the last of the four OP_RETURN messages \u2014 we can see that donation address in the upper right-hand corner of the Reactor graph above.\n\nThe address 1CMugHhsSf8Bzrp142BpvUynWBR1RiqMCk provides a good example of a case where the OP_RETURN vigilante may have hacked the private keys of Russian-controlled addresses. 1CMug\u2026 initially sent OP_RETURN transactions accusing several other addresses of belonging to the Russian government, burning its 0.059 BTC balance in the process (1CMug\u2026 initially received those funds in 2020 from an unknown source). Later, 1CMug\u2026 received OP_RETURN transactions from other addresses claiming that it too was connected to Russian government operations. Many of the other addresses followed a similar pattern. Assuming the OP_RETURN messages are true, activity like this would indicate that the OP_RETURN sender gained access to the private keys of some GRU addresses, either through hacking or collaboration with an insider.\n\nDo the accused addresses really belong to Russian intelligence and security services?\n\nThe value of the analysis above hinges on whether you believe the vigilante\u2019s claims. Anyone can say whatever they want in an OP_RETURN message, but how can we know that the addresses our vigilante tagged really are connected to Russian hacking activity?\n\nWe have good evidence for at least three of the addresses. Two of them \u2014 1DLA46sXYps3PdS3HpGfdt9MbQpo6FytPm and 1L5QKvh2Fc86j947rZt12rX1EFrCGb2uPf \u2014 are referenced in a now-archived blog post from cybersecurity firm HYAS, in which the firm indicates the Russian SVR utilized the addresses to purchase infrastructure used in the infamous Solarwinds hack.\n\nThe third address appears to have been used as part of a Russian disinformation campaign. In the leadup to the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, Russia\u2019s GRU covertly set up the website DCLeaks.com, and used it to publish hacked materials relating to U.S. political figures. The DOJ indictment against Russian intelligence officers involved in the disinformation campaign states that agents paid in Bitcoin to lease the DCLeaks.com server from a Malaysian web hosting provider. The address used to lease that server \u2014 18N9jzCDsV9ekiLW8jJSA1rXDXw1Yx4hDh \u2014 was also tagged by our OP_RETURN vigilante as belonging to the GRU.\n\nThe fact that the OP_RETURN messages appear to have been accurate for three of the addresses lends credibility to the claims against the others as well.\n\nWe should also note how much money the OP_RETURN sender gave up to spread these messages. An OP_RETURN is in essence an invalid transaction output, and effectively burns any Bitcoin sent to that output. If one wanted to simply send a message to another person via OP_RETURN, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to include anything more than a dust-sized amount of Bitcoin, since those funds will be rendered inaccessible. However, our OP_RETURN sender included substantial sums in most of these transactions, burning over $300,000 worth of Bitcoin in total. Our hypothesis is that the OP_RETURN sender did this to make the discovery of the transactions, and the accusations associated with them, more likely. The fact that the OP_RETURN sender was both willing and able to burn hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin in order to spread their message makes the information potentially more credible. Further, we should emphasize that the OP_RETURN sender stopped burning funds after the Russian invasion was underway. It was at this point that they instead began sending funds to Ukrainian aid addresses, suggesting relatively pure intentions and clarifying their support of the Ukrainian cause.\n\nHow does Bitcoin fit into the future of cyber warfare?\n\nIt turns out that a public, permanent, immutable ledger isn\u2019t just a strong foundation for a new, transparent financial system. It may also have a role in the future of cyber warfare. Assuming their messages are true, the OP_RETURN sender did something very powerful when they encoded their accusations onto the blockchain. Besides the fact that the Russian government has lost access to those Bitcoin thanks to the OP_RETURN function, it will now be very difficult for Russian agencies to use those addresses for similar purposes in the future, or to fund new addresses with Bitcoin currently held by the accused addresses. The possibility that the OP_RETURN sender acquired private keys for Russian-controlled addresses also suggests that the Putin regime\u2019s crypto operations aren\u2019t secure.\n\nMost importantly, those OP_RETURN messages will be there forever \u2014 no government or corporation can take them down. The unique case of the OP_RETURN vigilante underlines how important it is for 21st century militaries and intelligence agencies to understand and utilize blockchain technology, while also compromising their enemies\u2019 ability to do so.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

        "title": "7 Best Advantages Of Decentralized Currencies Like Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Do you know about Bitcoin and other cryptos that operate without a central authority? They provide advantages over conventional, centralized currencies. We\u2019ll look at the seven main benefits of Bitcoin and similar decentralized currencies to see why they\u2019re gaining popularity. Let\u2019s get started, so make yourself a cup of coffee.\n\nWhy Are Decentralized Currencies Gaining Popularity?\n\nBitcoin and other decentralized currencies are gaining popularity because of their many benefits over controlled currencies. The high level of protection and privacy it provides is a significant selling point. Using a decentralized currency allows for transactions to be documented on an unchangeable and publicly shared database called a blockchain. This eliminates the need to provide private information during a transaction, lowering the potential for fraud.\n\nDecentralized currencies save the time and cost of using intermediaries, allowing for quicker and cheaper transaction processing. They are more trustworthy since a single entity does not manage them. The transaction costs are often more affordable than conventional money\n\nDecentralized currencies are helpful for those needing access to conventional banking systems since they may be used by anybody with an internet connection, regardless of where they live or their financial standing. Last, some people see Bitcoin and other decentralized currencies as good investment options because of their growth potential.\n\nThe benefits of decentralized currencies are attracting more and more users and investors, and this trend is expected to continue in the years to come.\n\nThe 7 Advantages of Decentralized Currencies\n\nBecause of its many advantages over centralized currencies, decentralized ones like Bitcoin are quickly gaining popularity in the financial sector. Transactions in these digital currencies are recorded on a distributed ledger system known as a blockchain and are not subject to the oversight of any governing body or central authority. Users benefit from increased safety, privacy, and convenience, cheaper transaction costs, and the possibility of value appreciation. This essay will examine the rising popularity of decentralized currencies among users and investors by looking at their top benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvantages of Decentralized Currencies:\n\n1. Financial Inclusion\n\nThe principle of financial inclusion is that all people, regardless of location or socioeconomic status, should have equal opportunity to use and benefit from the financial system. Banking, loaning, insurance, and other financial services may fall under this category. Sadly, many people need help accessing these services because of the significant obstacles to entry posed by conventional financial institutions, such as account minimums or credit score restrictions.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies provide a decentralized alternative to conventional banking systems, which may facilitate greater financial inclusion. In contrast to fiat money issued by central banks, decentralized currencies do not need a bank account or a credit history for their use. Instead, access to the internet and a digital wallet is required to make and receive financial transactions.\n\n2. Immunity To Inflation\n\nIt is often believed that decentralized currencies, such as Bitcoin, are unaffected by inflation resulting from either government policy or economic shocks. This is because the quantity of such currencies is usually capped or otherwise preset, protecting them against abrupt spikes in supply that would otherwise cause their value to drop.\n\nYet, traditional currencies often experience inflationary pressures. Inflation may result from governments and central banks increasing the money supply by printing more currency or reducing interest rates. As a result, people may find it more costly to acquire necessities like food and shelter when the value of their currency decreases due to inflation.\n\nIn many cases, the total quantity of money that one may generate is capped for decentralized currencies like Bitcoin. Because of its small supply, it is less vulnerable to inflationary pressures brought on by spikes in production.\n\n3. Transparency\n\nOne of the main benefits of decentralized currencies like Bitcoin is their openness. All transactions on the blockchain are open and available to the public. The system may gain confidence and responsibility from its users if all transactions are public and easily accessible.\n\nIt might be challenging to see who did what and when in conventional monetary systems. Nevertheless, unlike controlled currencies, decentralized currencies are entirely transparent. This might make it harder to verify the legality of a transaction.\n\nThe blockchain is a public database that records every Bitcoin transaction, including the sender\u2019s address, the recipient\u2019s address, and the amount sent or received. The system may gain confidence and responsibility from its users if all transactions are public and easily accessible.\n\n4. No Geographic Barriers\n\nBitcoin and other decentralized currencies benefit from being global. This eliminates the necessity for centralized clearinghouses like banks or financial organizations in all but minor transactions.\n\nGeographical obstacles in traditional financial systems may make using them more accessible for certain people. For instance, some people may need more accessible access to banking services because they live in a rural or economically disadvantaged location. They may require assistance shopping or apply for credit as a result.\n\nThe opposite is true with decentralized currencies, which anybody with access to the internet may use. This eliminates the need for centralized monetary authorities such as banks or other financial organizations, making it possible for people in economically disadvantaged regions to make transactions and access financial services.\n\n5. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs are intended to operate without the oversight of a single person or group or are \u201ccompletely autonomous and decentralized.\u201d Instead, they are governed by the blockchain\u2019s community of stakeholders in exchange for governance tokens.\n\nDecisions in a DAO are made using a decentralized voting system. Decisions are made based on the results of votes cast by everyone in possession of governance tokens for the organization. This eliminates strict hierarchies and permits a more democratic, bottom-up decision-making approach.\n\n6. Potential for Growth\n\nBitcoin and other decentralized currencies have tremendous room for development, which is one of their primary benefits. Its potential originates from the fact that decentralized currencies are not anchored to any one national or economic system and may therefore function outside of established monetary frameworks.\n\nDecentralized currencies are not managed by the federal government or any other single entity like conventional financial systems. They may be employed in nations where the currency is volatile or where there are stringent limitations on money movement.\n\nMoreover, decentralized currency usage helps protect against inflation and economic uncertainty. For instance, individuals in nations with significant inflation may prefer to keep their wealth in decentralized currencies like Bitcoin. This may provide some insurance against currency depreciation and inflation.\n\n7. Security and Privacy\n\nDecentralized currencies, such as Bitcoin, provide several benefits, including security and anonymity. Blockchain technology is one of the key reasons behind this.\n\nCryptography is used to increase security. Blockchain transactions are protected by elaborate mathematical procedures, making them difficult to hack. Since it is decentralized, the blockchain has no single vulnerable point. Because of this, it\u2019s harder for hackers and cybercriminals to break in and steal money.\n\nDecentralized currencies enable users to avoid disclosing their financial information and history to financial organizations, a requirement of conventional economic systems. Furthermore, decentralized currencies help protect users\u2019 anonymity. Because of this, more people are opting for trading bots like Bitcoin Loophole. Pseudonymity is preserved throughout blockchain transactions since users are known only by their public addresses, not their names or other identifying details. This allows for a degree of discretion and anonymity unavailable via more conventional means of exchanging money.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are several benefits to using a decentralized currency like Bitcoin rather than a centralized one. Many people and companies would benefit from using decentralized currencies because of their desirable features, including their potential for growth, security, privacy, and resistance to inflation.\n\nDecentralized currencies are an intriguing and promising new development in the world of money, even though they still present significant difficulties and dangers. Decentralized currency markets are poised for further expansion and innovation as blockchain technology undergoes constant refinement and new applications and use cases are created.\n\nDecentralized currency markets are poised for further development and innovation as blockchain technology continuously improves and new applications and use cases are made. Decentralized currency markets are poised for further growth and innovation as blockchain technology undergoes continuous refinement and new applications and use cases are created."

Brendan McDermid/File Photo/Reuters\n\nBillionaire investor Ray Dalio said he has a little bitcoin but prefers gold.\n\nOn a recent podcast, he said bitcoin is volatile and has a smaller valuation than mega-cap stocks like Microsoft.\n\n\"I don't understand why people are more inclined to go to bitcoin than gold.\"\n\nRay Dalio said he holds a small amount of bitcoin, but the cryptocurrency moves in unreliable ways and the billionaire investor favors gold.\n\n\"I would prefer gold,\" he said on Chris Williamson's YouTube podcast this week, pointing out that bitcoin has a smaller valuation than mega-cap stocks like Microsoft.\n\nOn Thursday, bitcoin's market cap was about $574 billion, compared to Microsoft's $2.27 trillion.\n\n\"I don't understand why people are more inclined to go to bitcoin than gold.

        "title": "Using crypto for crime is not a bug \u2014 it's an industry feature - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nOne of the (many) times I have been heckled during a panel on crypto was when I argued that it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as money. The only reason to use it other than for speculation, I said, was to buy drugs on the internet. This was a preposterous idea, the heckler retorted; crypto is used for so much more than that.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts argue that it\u2019s wrong to claim that it enables crime because the technology itself is \u201cneutral\u201d so cannot be blamed for any illicit activity. But this simply isn\u2019t true: crypto was designed as a censorship-resistant payment mechanism that operates outside the traditional financial system and beyond the remit of regulators. Crypto transactions are not subjected to the same fraud detection, anti-money laundering or suspicious activity checks that traditional ones are. Operating outside the system is its very raison d\u2019\u00eatre. And one only has to look at how the crypto industry behaves to see that crime is not a bug; it\u2019s a feature.\n\nTake the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance, for instance. In a lawsuit filed last month against the exchange, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleges that Binance\u2019s former chief compliance officer said of certain Binance customers: \u201cLike come on. They are here for crime.\u201d The exchange\u2019s money laundering reporting officer, according to the CFTC, agreed: \u201cWe see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.\u201d\n\nIt would be funny if it weren\u2019t so flagrant. \u201cThese exchanges know exactly what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Stephen Diehl, co-author of Popping the Crypto Bubble, tells me. \u201cThey\u2019re basically creating a dark transnational payment network and, not surprisingly, that will be used by criminals. They\u2019re purpose-built for that.\u201d\n\nLast year was a turbulent year for crypto, with collapsing prices wiping about $1.5tn from the industry\u2019s \u201cmarket cap\u201d and with several high-profile businesses imploding. But despite the market downturn, it was also a record year for crypto-based crime: illicit crypto transactions topped $20bn in 2022, according to data analytics firm Chainalysis, up from $18bn the previous year, after a huge increase in transactions involving companies targeted by US sanctions (the majority coming from Russian-based exchange Garantex). Ransomware attacks were down a little on the year, but still accounted for almost half a billion dollars.\n\nNot only is that figure a \u201clower-bound estimate\u201d \u2014 the number is very likely to grow over time as the company identifies new crypto wallet addresses associated with unlawful activity \u2014 but it also only includes \u201con-chain\u201d activity, meaning only transactions that are recorded on the blockchain. It wouldn\u2019t include, therefore, the \u201cmassive fraud\u201d that allegedly took place at crypto exchange FTX, nor the proceeds of drug trafficking in which crypto has been used as the means of payment.\n\nNor does the figure include $23.8bn worth of money laundered via crypto in 2022 \u2014 a 68 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. In the UK alone, the National Crime Agency estimates that over $1bn of illicit cash is transferred overseas using crypto each year.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that crypto is used as part of the money-laundering methodology now \u2014 it\u2019s integrated into it,\u201d says Adrian Searle, director of the National Economic Crime Centre. Searle says that while the proportion of money laundering done in crypto is still relatively low, it is expected to increase rapidly, and is facilitating international criminal networks on an unprecedented scale.\n\nCrypto backers like to argue that crypto can be used for good, too. This is true enough \u2014 Blockchain data analytics company Elliptic told the FT this month that $200mn in crypto has been donated to pro-Ukraine causes since the war broke out, with more than $80mn of that sent directly to the Ukrainian government.\n\nBut that has to be put in context: the positives will always be outweighed by the negatives. Of the estimated $3.8bn worth of crypto that was stolen by hackers last year \u2014 another new record \u2014 some $1.7bn was stolen by North Korea-linked hackers, according to Chainalysis. This money is channelled, the UN claims, into the country\u2019s ballistic missile programme.\n\nOn the Dark Web \u2014 which is \u201cpredicated on the use of cryptocurrency\u201d, according to DCI Phil McInerney, who leads on cyber crime at the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council \u2014 crypto is used not just to buy and sell illegal substances, but 3D-printed firearms, compromised banking credentials, forged documents and child sexual abuse materials.\n\nSo in a funny way, my heckler was right: crypto isn\u2019t just used for speculating on and buying drugs on the internet: it\u2019s used for much murkier criminal activities, too.\n\njemima.kelly@ft.com\n\nLetter in response to this article:\n\nCryptocurrency critique can do with more context / From Daniel Aronoff, Research Scientist, MIT Cambridge, MA, US"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund (BLDF), a non-profit co-founded by Block (formerly Square) CEO Jack Dorsey, announced Wednesday that it is supporting the legal defense for a number of Bitcoin Core developers targeted by a lawsuit filed by Craig Wright and his firm, Tulip Trading.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund has stepped up to fight for more than just Bitcoin\u2014we are here to defend the right to build free, open-source software without fear,\u201d Jessica Jonas, Chief Legal Officer at the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, told Decrypt.\n\nThe announcement comes on the same day the Bitcoin Core developers filed their substantive defense in a UK court.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit, \u201cTulip Trading Limited v. Bitcoin Association For BSV & Others,\u201d Jonas says, stems from an alleged hack in 2020 that resulted in the loss of 111,000 Bitcoin that Wright claimed to own.\n\nAlthough BLDF calls the claims frivolous, Jonas says the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is backing 13 Bitcoin developers in two separate cases initiated by Wright or his associated companies and is calling the cases attacks on fundamental principles of freedom.\n\n\u201cWe need to take them seriously and defend them fervently because the potential stakes are too high to ignore,\u201d Jonas said.\n\nAt issue in the case, Jonas says, is whether Bitcoin developers have a fiduciary duty to Bitcoin users.\n\n\u201cWright is arguing that they owe a fiduciary duty, and as such, they should be obligated to create a \u2018backdoor\u2019 to allow him to access coins he claims to have lost,\u201d she said, adding that it would compromise Bitcoin\u2019s core feature as a fully distributed open-source software to do so, since by design no individual or group can retroactively alter the blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe group hopes to rally public support against this and future legal attacks by Wright.\n\n\u201cBy rallying the public and demonstrating widespread support for the defendants, we aim to show Wright and his team that their legal tactics will not go unchallenged,\u201d Jonas said.\n\nSince 2016, the controversial Australian computer scientist has launched several lawsuits, including accusing sites posting the Bitcoin whitepaper of copyright infringement after claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. Earlier this month, Wright hinted that Apple might be violating copyright law when it was discovered that a copy of the Bitcoin whitepaper had been hidden on Apple\u2019s computers since at least 2018.\n\nThe Bitcoin Association for BSV has not yet responded to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIntroducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be \u201cprofoundly dangerous\u201d to society as it would mean the government having visibility into every single transaction of its citizens, according to Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned about the risk of a CBDC,\u201d Cruz stated during the Bitcoin Policy Summit on Wednesday.\n\nDrawing parallels between President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order that directed the Federal Reserve to explore the launch of CBDC and China\u2019s experiments with the digital yuan, Cruz said that the intention of using a CBDC is \u201cto destroy all value of Bitcoin, to destroy anonymity, to destroy decentralization.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCBDCs share some similarities with stablecoins in that they are linked to the value of a sovereign currency, such as the U.S. dollar. However, there is a crucial distinction between the two: CBDCs are issued and managed by national governments or central banks, while stablecoins are created by private entities on decentralized networks, such as Tether's USDT or Circle's USDC, the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization.\n\n\u201cThe same people that want to see a CBDC, they hate Bitcoin, and they hate cash,\u201d said the Texas lawmaker. \u201cLet's be clear, they don't like cash for exactly the reason I like cash because it is not subjected to centralized control that is not subject to constant surveillance. And so I hope we see growing resistance to a CBDC.\u201d\n\nCruz reveals personal investment in Bitcoin\n\nCruz also praised Bitcoin, which he said he is \u201cincredibly excited and incredibly bullish on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin is clearly the alpha in the current crypto sphere, both in terms of coming first and also being clearly the most dominant,\" he said. \"I think the analogy of digital gold is powerful and the insight that led to his creation is still extraordinary.\u201d\n\nCruz also revealed that he is personally investing in the leading cryptocurrency, having a standing order every Monday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI own a little more than two bitcoins and I want a little bit more. I bought the dip, which I was quite happy with, but I'm also a long-term investor,\" said Cruz. \"I'm fine with some volatility.\"\n\nAccording to him, one of the attractions of Bitcoin is that it has a limited supply of 21 million coins, suggesting that it serves as a hedge against inflation\u2014a particularly important feature \u201cwhen you have irresponsible politicians in Washington that spend money like drunken sailors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhich is actually not fair to the sailors because at least they're spending their own money,\u201d added Cruz.\n\nStopping the government\n\nLast month, Cruz introduced legislation in March to prohibit the Fed or the federal government from creating a CBDC, stating at the time that the U.S. government had \u201cno authority to unilaterally establish a central bank currency.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't want the government having control over your finances,\u201d said Cruz during yesterday\u2019s event, adding that one element of President Biden\u2019s legislative initiative was a requirement that banks report every single transaction in excess of $600 to the federal government.\n\n\u201cThat means your rent payment every month. If you own a home, that means your mortgage payment every month. If you own a car, most car payments now are north of $600. It is literally the government having visibility on virtually every transaction you're making. That's their stated goal,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nAccording to him, decisions like these should be made by Congress elected by the people, not by the \u201cFederal Reserve governors that have no accountability to the American people.\u201d"

        "title": "Is the Bitcoin Bear Market Over? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The woes of 2022 that plagued Bitcoin (BTC -0.31%) look to have been forgotten as the leading cryptocurrency has climbed more than 65% since the beginning of the new year. Thanks to this rally, optimists are hopeful that this renewed momentum might be enough to officially call for an end to the bear market that saw Bitcoin lose nearly 70% of its value.\n\nTo truly evaluate whether Bitcoin has put the latest crypto winter in the rearview mirror, investors need to look at some metrics other than just its price to accurately gauge the likelihood of a bull market on the horizon.\n\nWhile the purpose of Bitcoin as an investment remains ambiguous, likely due to the variety of roles it is able to play, at its core it is a decentralized payment network. Therefore, by measuring activity on the network in the form of user addresses and transactions, investors can get a glimpse into the health of Bitcoin today relative to other bear and bull market cycles.\n\nWhat the network says\n\nTo start, let's look at addresses. Rather than the total number of addresses, which is constantly growing, the rate at which new addresses are joining the network can be more telling.\n\nAfter reaching some of its lowest levels since early 2020, there has been a resurgence in the number of new addresses doing transactions on the network. During the past quarter, an average of more than 13.5 million new addresses joined the blockchain per month, according to Glassnode, a crypto research and data firm. The last time levels were this high was back in the first quarter of 2021 when Bitcoin went on a run that ended up with it just shy of $63,000. In fact, this March registered the largest increase of addresses since April 2021 with a whopping 14.4 million new users.\n\nWith a near record amount of new addresses using the network, it would be plausible to assume that transactions are also at cycle highs -- and that assumption would be correct.\n\nIn Q1 of this year, Bitcoin averaged just shy of 9 million transactions per month as demand for the cryptocurrency soared. Similar to the rate of new address growth, you would have to go back to Q1 2021 when Bitcoin was comfortably in the midst of a bull market to find transactions at these levels.\n\nNot quite there yet\n\nWith address growth and an increase in transactions, Bitcoin has seen its price rise considerably since the beginning of 2023. From January to March, Bitcoin rallied 72%. Following the recurring theme of address growth and transaction counts, this was its best performance over a quarterly period since Q1 2021, when it skyrocketed 103%.\n\nWhen taking into consideration the combination of all these metrics, it might be enough to call for the end of Bitcoin's bear market blues. However, optimism for a bull market like that of 2021 to return this year might be misconstrued.\n\nRather, it seems Bitcoin is currently in no-man's land straddling the edges of the past bear market and its potential next leg up in a coming bull market. But while it remains in this territory, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency still looks to be a bargain. Considering that it remains more than 50% below its all time high and yet crucial metrics are near levels last seen when Bitcoin's price was worth more than $60,000, buying the cryptocurrency today could prove to be lucrative should a bull market return."

        "title": "CBDCs Are Designed to 'Destroy All the Value of Bitcoin': US Senator Ted Cruz - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would be \u201cprofoundly dangerous\u201d to society as it would mean the government having visibility into every single transaction of its citizens, according to Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned about the risk of a CBDC,\u201d Cruz stated during the Bitcoin Policy Summit on Wednesday.\n\nDrawing parallels between President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order that directed the Federal Reserve to explore the launch of CBDC and China\u2019s experiments with the digital yuan, Cruz said that the intention of using a CBDC is \u201cto destroy all value of Bitcoin, to destroy anonymity, to destroy decentralization.\u201d\n\nCBDCs share some similarities with stablecoins in that they are linked to the value of a sovereign currency, such as the U.S. dollar. However, there is a crucial distinction between the two: CBDCs are issued and managed by national governments or central banks, while stablecoins are created by private entities on decentralized networks, such as Tether's USDT or Circle's USDC, the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization.\n\n\u201cThe same people that want to see a CBDC, they hate Bitcoin, and they hate cash,\u201d said the Texas lawmaker. \u201cLet's be clear, they don't like cash for exactly the reason I like cash because it is not subjected to centralized control that is not subject to constant surveillance. And so I hope we see growing resistance to a CBDC.\u201d\n\nCruz reveals personal investment in Bitcoin\n\nCruz also praised Bitcoin, which he said he is \u201cincredibly excited and incredibly bullish on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin is clearly the alpha in the current crypto sphere, both in terms of coming first and also being clearly the most dominant,\" he said. \"I think the analogy of digital gold is powerful and the insight that led to his creation is still extraordinary.\u201d\n\nCruz also revealed that he is personally investing in the leading cryptocurrency, having a standing order every Monday.\n\n\u201cI own a little more than two bitcoins and I want a little bit more. I bought the dip, which I was quite happy with, but I'm also a long-term investor,\" said Cruz. \"I'm fine with some volatility.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to him, one of the attractions of Bitcoin is that it has a limited supply of 21 million coins, suggesting that it serves as a hedge against inflation\u2014a particularly important feature \u201cwhen you have irresponsible politicians in Washington that spend money like drunken sailors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhich is actually not fair to the sailors because at least they're spending their own money,\u201d added Cruz.\n\nStopping the government\n\nLast month, Cruz introduced legislation in March to prohibit the Fed or the federal government from creating a CBDC, stating at the time that the U.S. government had \u201cno authority to unilaterally establish a central bank currency.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't want the government having control over your finances,\u201d said Cruz during yesterday\u2019s event, adding that one element of President Biden\u2019s legislative initiative was a requirement that banks report every single transaction in excess of $600 to the federal government.\n\nUS Senator Ted Cruz Proposes CBDC Ban Amid Growing Republican Pushback\n\n\u201cThat means your rent payment every month. If you own a home, that means your mortgage payment every month. If you own a car, most car payments now are north of $600. It is literally the government having visibility on virtually every transaction you're making. That's their stated goal,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nAccording to him, decisions like these should be made by Congress elected by the people, not by the \u201cFederal Reserve governors that have no accountability to the American people.\u201d"

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Ethereum has slashed its energy use by 99.99 per cent - New Scientist",
        "content": "An experimental update to Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency, has led to a dramatic reduction in the energy used to secure the currency and verify transactions\n\nEthereum is the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency SKapl/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has successfully slashed its emissions by 99.99 per cent after an unprecedented experiment to ditch power-hungry mining in favour of a new approach, according to researchers. But experts say there is little appetite for such a change among users of bitcoin, the largest digital currency, which has no central body to steer development.\n\nLike bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum used to rely on \u201cproof of work\u201d to secure its network, meaning that computers performed huge numbers of calculations to \u201cmine\u201d new currency and verify transactions. This process uses vast amounts of electricity. But in September 2022, Ethereum switched to a new technique called \u201cproof of stake\u201d during a period of change known as the Merge.\n\nThe Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) has published comprehensive data on bitcoin\u2019s energy use over the past four years and has now released similar data for Ethereum. Alexander Neum\u00fcller at the University of Cambridge, who worked on the project, says the experimental update has been a technological success, achieving a \u201cstaggering\u201d reduction in electricity consumption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the new system, instead of using computer hardware to mine new currency to get a reward, validators lodge money with the network to gain the right to validate transactions and be rewarded. Before the Merge took place, the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organisation that oversees the development of Ethereum, estimated that this would cut energy use by 99 per cent, but the results of the switch were unpredictable, as nothing on the same scale had been attempted before.\n\nEthereum had, like bitcoin, been using more energy each year since its launch in 2015. According to CCAF\u2019s data, it used 16.4 terrawatt hours in 2021. By 14 September 2022 \u2013 the day before the Merge \u2013 it had already used 17.6TWh, and was on course to end the year at 21.4TWh.\n\nThe CCAF now estimates that Ethereum will consume just 6.6 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, equivalent to about 2000 typical homes in the UK. In contrast, Ethereum\u2019s previous consumption from its launch to the Merge totalled 58.3 TWh \u2013 comparable to Switzerland\u2019s annual electricity consumption.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nNeum\u00fcller says success was far from guaranteed due to the scale of the challenge. \u201cAn often-used anecdote in that regard was changing a jet engine during flight,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been executed very well. No one knew exactly what was going to happen.\u201d\n\nSome analysis has suggested that although Ethereum\u2019s power consumption has dropped, the hardware that used to account for it is now being used for other purposes. Kyle McDonald, who carried out his own research on the energy use of the Ethereum network before the Merge, says large numbers of disgruntled miners who were left with hugely expensive, specialised hardware and no source of income decided to continue harvesting other coins.\n\nBut Neum\u00fcller says not all miners switched and there is evidence that many sold off their hardware. His research looked at the other cryptocurrencies that miners could have profitably switched to and calculated that, between 8 September 2022 and 4 March 2023, nearly 80 per cent of the computational power used for mining had simply disappeared, as miners gave up and sold their hardware.\n\nDespite the success of Ethereum\u2019s switch, Neum\u00fcller says that the bitcoin network is too attached to its current proof-of-work approach to follow suit.\n\nEthan Vera, co-founder of cryptocurrency firm Luxor Mining, also believes that a similar change in bitcoin is unlikely. \u201cProof of work is fundamental to bitcoin. The use of energy is critical to its security mechanism,\u201d he says."

        "content": "The University of Oxford estimates that they already consume 0.63% of the world's energy and result in higher electricity bills for households\n\nBy Miguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Vega\n\nIt is a young technology at barely 14 years old. It was meant to change the world. But, for the time being, it has become an energy problem. The shine of cryptocurrencies is far from sustainable. The most famous of the hundreds in existence, Bitcoin, consumes 127 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year. More than Norway in the same time period. According to The New York Times, there are 34 large-scale cryptocurrency mines in the United States alone, putting tremendous pressure on the power grid. What's more, their carbon footprint is the equivalent of having 3.5 million more cars on the country's roads, the tech NGO WattTime points out. In Texas alone, according to a study by the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, the increased energy demand has caused households' electricity bills to rise 5%. That is, some $1.8 billion per year. \"They are unsustainable,\" says Gavin Brown, professor of Financial Technology at the University of Liverpool (UK). He adds: \"Oxford University estimates that cryptocurrencies account for 0.63% of electricity usage worldwide. This figure is slightly higher than Pakistan.\u201d A single Bitcoin transaction takes ten minutes. By comparison, Visa processes 1,700 per second.\n\nThis all started in hopes of improving the planet, of course. In 2008, the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. A decentralized currency. In other words, its use and validation would be independent of the central banks. Instead of relying on those institutions to safeguard money, its transactions are verified by a sort of huge public ledger called blockchain. With this technology, in theory, intermediaries and commissions disappear. If it had existed in Picasso's Paris, it would have been considered a libertarian coin.\n\nHowever, what initially almost seemed like a hobby has unexpectedly become a huge industry. The value of Bitcoin jumped from $1,000 in 2017 to $60,000 in 2021. Nevertheless, since that date it has fallen sharply. But there are two sides to every coin. \"Bitcoin is an algorithm, and whenever you want to add a transaction to a blockchain (set of operations), you need to solve a complex cryptographic equation; that's called proof of work,\" explains Enrique Dans, professor of Innovation at IE Business School. It's simple. The \"currency\" consists of deciphering this equation. The problem? Competition is growing exponentially, and numbers are getting harder to find. Because only one miner will win the race. 99.9% will lose and waste energy needlessly. The only option? Put hundreds of thousands of computers (known as farms) to work on calculations. It therefore takes a lot of electricity to find the solution quickly and earn digital money. Miners who discover that solution are rewarded in bitcoins. It's the new gold rush of the 21st century. \"I think they're exploiting the [electricity] system,\" warns Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, an expert on energy prices. \"But they will say, 'You know, the system was already there,' and I'm sympathetic to that in some ways.\"\n\nHowever, this is not a sentiment that everyone shares. China banned bitcoin mining in August 2021. The country declared it \"undesirable.\" Despite all this, clandestine mining is still underway. Golden technology continues to exist. In fact, it is controlled by the United States (38%), China (20%, despite the ban), Kazakhstan (13%), Canada and Russia, with 6% of the market. Thousands of people sift through numbers just as prospectors used to sift through river water, panning for gold. As if the competition were not enough, the number of bitcoins is finite: 21 million units. According to Enrique Dans, an estimated 97% has already been mined. The business will then be in the exchange of digital currency.\n\nBitcoin is certainly not the only cryptocurrency with a disproportionate energy expenditure. A single Litecoin transaction requires 18,957 kilowatts, and the Bitcoin Cash variant comes in at 18,522. It has inevitably come under fire from critics. \"Bitcoin will always live in some dark corner of the internet, just like a virus protected in a bunker. There is no way of getting rid of every trace. We just have to convince as many people as possible to give it up and never raise it from the dead again,\" advises Pete Howson, professor of Environmental Science at Northumbria University (UK).\n\nHowever, some might remember that passage from the Old Testament and the voice of Christ: \"Lazarus, come forth.\" Ethereum (ETH) is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin. Last year, it reduced 99% of the energy required to solve the equation by changing algorithms. Instead of using miners, it relies on validators. Anyone with at least 32 ETH attains the rank of validator. The platform randomly selects them to approve the creation of new blocks. That is, to verify that user transactions comply with network standards. This program, which has taken years of work, is called \"Merge.\" The advantages will include speed, cost and transaction capacity. And a smaller carbon footprint.\n\nWith this \u201cgreen zeal,\u201d some cryptocurrencies have introduced pre-mining to avoid IT waste. The system works in a similar way to fiat currency (the old banknotes) and stocks. A central authority creates a fixed amount of a currency and releases it carefully, depending on what is happening in the world or the economy. Other virtual currencies, such as Ripple, are generated from algorithms. This eliminates teams of miners searching for the solution at a tremendous speed with their thousands of polluting computers.\n\nWithin this unpredictable world, what experts call \"market sentiment\" is moving towards greener digital currencies. One option is charging a fee for the carbon generated whenever a bitcoin is acquired. The fact that Daniel Batten, one of the most popular (22,000 followers) climate activists on Twitter, is also an investor in this currency shows \"that emissions in the mining of this cryptocurrency are decreasing rapidly,\u201d notes Simon Peters, an analyst at the E-Toro brokerage house. Despite all this, Bitcoin remains far behind Ethereum on the path to sustainability. \"And it's unlikely to change anytime soon,\" Peters clarifies.\n\nThere are also those who are willing to admit the enormous energy expenditure of these currencies and the effort they are making to limit it and use increasingly renewable sources. But we can't ignore the fine print. \"It is urgent to reduce the energy consumption of industrial and production activity as a whole,\" says Albert Salvany, a consultant at PriorityGate, a company specialized in artificial intelligence. \"But it is surprising how, at times, this concern does not extend to other activities that are far more important in terms of total volume per kilowatt-hour,\" he points out. Perhaps the reason is that all these complex equations are a socially sensitive issue. Many young people assumed it was an easy way to earn money. And they forgot that there was a lot of gambling involved. They rolled the dice, and almost everyone lost. The volatility (ups and downs) of these currencies is almost instantaneous. This also contains a valuable lesson. Norman Foster, perhaps the most influential architect of the last 50 years, grew up in a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Manchester (UK). His mother was a waitress. Someone once asked him: What did you learn from your parents? \u201cThree words,\u201d he replied. \"Work, work, work.\" There are no shortcuts in life, not even digital ones.\n\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Vega\n\nHe has been writing for EL PA\u00cdS for some 25 years, currently for Cultura, Negocios, El Pa\u00eds Semanal, Retina, Suplementos Especiales, and Ideas. His texts have been republished by La Naci\u00f3n (Argentina), La Tercera (Chile) or Le Monde (France).

        "content": "A systems architect cracked a seed phrase and won a 100,000 Satoshi bounty, or 0.001 Bitcoin (BTC), worth $29, in just under half an hour. Cointelegraph spoke to Andrew Fraser in Boston, who underscored how critical it is to keep a Bitcoin wallet seed phrase secure and offline.\n\nA seed phrase or recovery phrase is a string of random words generated when a wallet is created that can access the wallet, similar to a master key. Fraser brute forced a 12-word seed phrase that Bitcoin educator \u201cWicked Bitcoin\u201d shared on Twitter:\n\nAnyone want to try and brute force this 12-word seed phrase securing 100,000 sats? I\u2019ll give you all 12 words but in no particular order. Standard derivation path m/84'/0'/0'\u2026no fancy tricks. GL.https://t.co/c9FyMv3HYM pic.twitter.com/nPGTB9bX2g \u2014 Wicked (@w_s_bitcoin) April 26, 2023\n\nAs shown, Wicked\u2019s Tweet challenged users to decipher the correct order of the 12-word seed phrase.\n\n\u201cAnyone wants to try and brute force this 12-word seed phrase securing 100,000 sats? I\u2019ll give you all 12 words but in no particular order. Standard derivation path m/84'/0'/0'\u2026no fancy tricks. GL.\u201d\n\nIt took just 25 minutes to unlock the 100,000 satoshis, worth just under $30. The incident serves as a timely reminder for Bitcoin users and crypto enthusiasts to take crypto security seriously.\n\nFraser cracked the code using BTCrecover, a software application available on GitHub. The software offers a range of tools that can determine seed phrases with missing or scrambled mnemonics and passphrase-cracking utilities. Over Twitter DMs, Fraser told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cMy gaming GPU was able to determine the correct order of the seed phrase in about 25 minutes. Though a more capable system would do it much faster.\u201d\n\nHe noted that anyone with a basic knowledge of running Python scripts, using the Windows command shell, and understanding the Bitcoin protocol\u2014particularly BIP39 mnemonics \u2014 should be able to replicate his success.\n\nCointelegraph queried Fraser about the security of 12-word seed keys. Fraser explained they are \u201cperfectly secure if the words remain unknown to an attacker or there is a passphrase \u201813th seed word\u2019 used in the derivation path of the wallet.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he emphasized the superior security of 24-word seed keys.\n\n\u201cEven if an attacker knew the out of order words of your 24-word seed key, they would never stand a hope of discovering the correct seed.\u201d\n\nFraser broke down the entropy calculations to explain the difference in security between the two types of seed keys. A 12-word seed has approximately 128 bits of entropy, while a 24-word seed boasts 256 bits. When an attacker knows the unordered words of a 12-word seed, there are only around half a billion possible combinations, which is relatively easy to test with a decent GPU. A 24-word seed, however, has roughly 6.24^24 possible combinations \u2014 and that\u2019s a lot of zeros.\n\nRelated: The worst places to keep your crypto wallet seed phrase\n\nEven the probability of an attacker cracking a 12-word seed phrase is borderline absurd. A 24-word seed phrase may be superior, but as Wicked pointe out in a post-mortem to the seed phrase challenge, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be hacked tbh.\u201d\n\nIn the off chance that someone finds your seed phrase cut up and out of order, then yes lol. \u2014 Wicked (@w_s_bitcoin) April 27, 2023\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s a timely reminder to readers to ensure seed phrases are never published or shared online. That means seed phrases should not be stored in a password manager or a cloud storage solution, and they certainly should not be typed out into a phone.\n\nFraser also stressed the importance of keeping seed keys secret and to take advantage of a passphrase that functions as part of the derivation path. As for the 100,000 sats that Fraser took home? Fraser tweeted that he spent them on dinner that night: chicken marsala. Talk about circular economy.\n\nCointelegraph Magazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

In fact, he first posted about it on the Bitcoin.org forums on May 18, 2010, writing, \u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas\u2026 like maybe 2 large ones so I have some leftover for the next day. I like having leftover pizza to nibble on later\u2026 If you\u2019re interested, please let me know, and we can work out a deal.\u201d\n\nDays went by, and Hanyecz was still pizza-less. By Friday, some users even reached out to him to ask if he was \u201cgetting hungry.\u201d Finally, Jercos came to the rescue and helped him complete the delivery on Saturday around 2:16 p.m. EST, according to records supported by Bitcoin Talk.\n\nHanyecz bought more than two pizzas for Bitcoin\n\nHanyecz made history by purchasing two pizzas with Bitcoin. But he didn\u2019t stop there. He wanted to push the boundaries even further. So, in June of that same year, he made an open offer: he would trade 10,000 BTC for two pizzas, anytime, as long as he had the funds (which he usually did). The rumor mill suggests that he may have made more pizza-related deals, and there\u2019s some evidence to support this theory. But eventually, Hanyecz brought his open offer to a close in August.\n\nJercos eventually sold his Bitcoin\n\nAs the Bitcoin Pizza Day celebration gained popularity, Jeremy \u201cJercos\u201d Sturdivant found himself in the spotlight once again. In 2015, he gave his only interview to \u201cBitcoin Who\u2019s Who,\u201d five years after his historic trade with Laszlo Hanyecz. Jercos was the other half of the first-ever recorded Bitcoin purchase of a physical item or service, and his story is one for the ages.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day wasn\u2019t widely celebrated initially.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day, a well-known event in the cryptocurrency world, has a fascinating history. However, it wasn\u2019t until 2014 that it gained popularity. This is partly because, before 2013, few people knew about Bitcoin. The story of the first Bitcoin pizza purchase by Laszlo Hanyecz gained attention thanks to a New York Times article and, later, a blog and tweet from the @Bitcoin Twitter account. With Bitcoin reaching a price of $1,000 at the time, major media outlets like ABC News, TechCrunch, Slate, and The Wall Street Journal picked up the story, making it a national phenomenon in the United States.\n\nThe Impact of Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nThe story of the pizza purchase is now legendary, but it\u2019s essential to understand why it was such a big deal. Until this point, Bitcoin was purely an experimental concept, and nobody knew if it could work as a form of digital currency. The fact that Hanyecz was willing to trade his bitcoins for something as simple as pizza demonstrated that Bitcoin had real-world value and could be used as a medium of exchange.\n\nAlso read:El Salvador Purchases Bitcoins Worth $10 Million, Vows To Purchase More With Bitcoin Becoming Legal\n\nFast forward to today, and Bitcoin has become one of the most well-known and valuable cryptocurrencies globally, with a market capitalization of over $500 billion. While the idea of using Bitcoin to purchase everyday items like pizza was once a novelty, it\u2019s now a common occurrence. Restaurants like Burger King and Miami\u2019s Pizza Bat allow customers to pay with bitcoins.\n\nIn fact, some pizza restaurants around the world have embraced Bitcoin as a form of payment, with some even offering discounts to customers who pay with cryptocurrency. This shift towards embracing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies shows that the currency is becoming more widely accepted as a legitimate form of payment.\n\nSo why is the pizza purchase such a significant event in the history of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency? First and foremost, it demonstrated the potential of cryptocurrency as a means of exchange. The fact that someone was willing to trade a valuable asset like Bitcoin for something as simple as pizza showed that the currency had real-world value.\n\nMoreover, the pizza purchase highlighted the potential for cryptocurrency to disrupt traditional payment systems. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a decentralized and secure way of transferring value without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. This has the potential to reduce transaction fees and increase financial inclusion, especially for those who are unbanked or underbanked.\n\nThe Evolution of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency\n\nSince Bitcoin Pizza Day in 2010, the cryptocurrency landscape has undergone dramatic changes that have reshaped the way we perceive and interact with digital currencies. From the humble beginnings of Bitcoin, which was first used to purchase two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, to the emergence of a plethora of altcoins, cryptocurrencies have come a long way in just over a decade.\n\nFor beginners, understanding the cryptocurrency landscape can be a daunting task, especially given the rapidly changing nature of the market. But fear not; as we delve into the key changes that have occurred since Bitcoin Pizza Day, we\u2019ll provide an informative overview of the current state of the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nOne of the most significant changes since Bitcoin Pizza Day has been the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies by mainstream financial institutions. This adoption has been driven by the recognition of the potential benefits that Blockchain technology can offer, including faster and more secure transactions, reduced costs, and greater transparency.\n\nAnother significant development has been the proliferation of altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies, which have emerged as competitors to Bitcoin. These altcoins are often based on different Blockchain technologies and offer unique features and benefits that appeal to specific audiences.\n\nMoreover, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) has been a major game-changer in the cryptocurrency space. DeFi refers to a set of financial applications built on top of Blockchain technology that seeks to decentralize traditional financial systems. This has opened up a new world of possibilities, including peer-to-peer lending, decentralized exchanges, and more.\n\nThe rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has also been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency landscape since Bitcoin Pizza Day. NFTs are unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded like any other asset. This has opened up a new world of possibilities for creators and collectors, as NFTs have the potential to revolutionize the art, music, and gaming industries.\n\nDespite the progress that has been made in the cryptocurrency landscape, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. One of the most significant challenges is the issue of scalability, as the current Blockchain infrastructure can only handle a limited number of transactions per second. This has led to slower transaction times and higher fees, which can be a barrier to adoption for some users.\n\nCelebrating Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nIdeas for celebrating Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nHost a Bitcoin Pizza Party\n\nOne great way to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day is by hosting a Bitcoin pizza party. Invite your friends and family over for a fun and informal gathering centered around pizza and Bitcoin. You can order pizzas from your favorite pizzeria and have everyone chip in to cover the cost. Alternatively, you can make your own pizzas at home and experiment with different toppings and flavors. To make the party more interesting, you can also set up a Bitcoin-themed game or trivia night, where guests can learn more about the history and technology behind Bitcoin while enjoying delicious pizza.\n\nParticipate in a Bitcoin Pizza Day Meetup\n\nMany Bitcoin and cryptocurrency communities around the world organize Bitcoin Pizza Day meetups. These meetups are a great opportunity to meet like-minded individuals and celebrate the progress made by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To find a meetup near you, you can search for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency groups on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. If you cannot find a meetup in your area, consider starting one yourself. You can use social media platforms to promote your event and invite other Bitcoin enthusiasts to join you for pizza and conversation.\n\nDonate Bitcoin to Charity\n\nAnother way to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day is by giving back to the community. You can donate Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to a charity or nonprofit organization that accepts them as donations.

Retailers such as Newegg, Overstock, and Best Buy have embraced cryptocurrency as a payment option, allowing you to purchase smartphones, laptops, tablets, and TVs using Bitcoin. From the latest iPhone to high-performance gaming rigs, the world of electronics is at your fingertips with Bitcoin.\n\nGift cards\n\nBitcoin\u2019s versatility extends beyond physical goods, as you can also use it to acquire gift cards for popular retailers like Amazon, Starbucks, and Target.

Platforms like CheapAir, Expedia, and Travala allow you to book flights, hotels, and rental cars with Bitcoin. Whether you\u2019re planning a weekend getaway or a globetrotting adventure, Bitcoin opens up a world of travel possibilities.\n\nFood and drinks\n\nBitcoin\u2019s reach extends to the realm of gastronomy as well. In the United States, major food chains like Subway, Burger King, and Starbucks now accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment. This means you can enjoy your favorite sandwiches, burgers, and even your daily cup of coffee using your Bitcoin wallet.

Luxury brands like Ralph Lauren, Gucci, and Nike have joined the crypto movement, accepting Bitcoin as a payment option for fashion items. From trendy clothing to stylish shoes and elegant jewelry, you can enhance your wardrobe while immersing yourself in the digital age of finance.\n\nReal estate\n\nTraditionally, buying real estate involved complex processes and multiple intermediaries. However, Bitcoin has found its way into the real estate market, simplifying transactions and offering new opportunities. Companies like Casavo and Propy enable you to purchase properties using Bitcoin, whether it\u2019s a dream home or an investment opportunity. Bitcoin\u2019s borderless nature allows for seamless cross-border transactions, revolutionizing the way we think about property purchases.\n\nCars\n\nIn an unexpected twist, the automotive industry has begun to embrace Bitcoin as a form of payment. Dealerships such as BitCars and ImportMarques now accept Bitcoin for purchasing both new and used cars. This integration of cryptocurrency into the car-buying process offers a new level of convenience and expands the possibilities for Bitcoin holders.\n\nOther items\n\nThe list of items you can buy with Bitcoin extends far beyond electronics, travel, food, fashion, real estate, and cars. It encompasses a wide range of goods and services, including domain names, artwork, and yes, even pizza. Bitcoin\u2019s acceptance has grown exponentially, and as a result, the number of merchants and service providers willing to accept this digital currency is constantly expanding. It\u2019s a testament to the growing adoption of Bitcoin and its potential as a mainstream medium of exchange.\n\nConsiderations when buying with Bitcoin\n\nWhile the convenience and flexibility of Bitcoin as a payment method are undeniable, it\u2019s important to keep a few things in mind when using this cryptocurrency for purchases:\n\nProcessing fees: When using Bitcoin for purchases, it\u2019s important to be aware of potential processing fees. Unlike traditional payment methods, Bitcoin transactions are not subject to the same regulations and intermediaries, which can result in varying fees charged by merchants. Before making a purchase, it\u2019s advisable to check if there are any additional costs associated with using Bitcoin as a payment method. Understanding these fees will help you make informed decisions and compare the overall cost of using Bitcoin versus traditional payment options.\n\nWhen using Bitcoin for purchases, it\u2019s important to be aware of potential processing fees.

Exchange rate fluctuations: Bitcoin\u2019s value is known for its volatility, which means its exchange rate against fiat currencies can change rapidly. When making a purchase with Bitcoin, it\u2019s crucial to consider the potential impact of exchange rate fluctuations. The Bitcoin price at the time of purchase may differ from its value when you initially acquired the cryptocurrency. This means that the amount of Bitcoin required for a specific purchase may vary over time. Staying updated with the latest exchange rates and monitoring market trends can help you mitigate the risks associated with price volatility.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value is known for its volatility, which means its exchange rate against fiat currencies can change rapidly.

Wallet compatibility: Bitcoin is stored in digital wallets, and not all merchants accept all types of Bitcoin wallets. Before making a purchase, it\u2019s essential to verify that the merchant supports your specific Bitcoin wallet. There are various types of wallets, including software wallets, hardware wallets, and online wallets. Each wallet has its own unique address format or QR code that facilitates transactions. Ensuring compatibility between your wallet and the merchant\u2019s system will help streamline the payment process and avoid any potential complications.\n\nBitcoin is stored in digital wallets, and not all merchants accept all types of Bitcoin wallets.

Bitcoin transactions typically take a few minutes to an hour for confirmations to occur. It\u2019s important to be patient and wait for the necessary confirmations before considering the transaction complete. Merchants usually provide instructions or notifications regarding the required confirmations, so paying attention to their guidelines is crucial for a smooth purchasing experience.\n\nBitcoin transactions require confirmations on the blockchain network to validate and finalize the payment.

Additionally, consider using two-factor authentication (2FA) and secure your Bitcoin wallet with a strong password or other security measures to protect your funds.\n\nRemember, the decision to invest in Bitcoin should be based on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term investment goals. Seek professional advice and conduct thorough research to make informed investment decisions.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin as an Investment Asset\n\nIn recent years, Bitcoin has emerged as a captivating investment asset, captivating the attention of both beginner and professional investors alike. But what exactly is Bitcoin, and why has it gained such popularity in the investment world?\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as a cryptocurrency, is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a technology called blockchain. Unlike traditional fiat currencies that are controlled by central banks, Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing for secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nAs an investment asset, Bitcoin presents several unique characteristics that make it appealing to investors. One of the key factors is its limited supply. The total number of bitcoins that can ever exist is capped at 21 million, which creates scarcity and potentially increases its value over time.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and the underlying blockchain technology provide a level of transparency and security that traditional investments may lack. Transactions conducted on the blockchain are recorded on a public ledger, ensuring immutability and reducing the risk of fraud.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that investing in Bitcoin carries its own set of risks and rewards, which we will delve into further. Before making any investment decisions, it\u2019s crucial to understand these factors and adopt a strategic approach.\n\nTips for Investing in Bitcoin Wisely\n\nWhen it comes to investing in Bitcoin, wise decision-making is essential. Here are some tips to help you navigate the world of Bitcoin investments with prudence and confidence:\n\nEducate Yourself: Before diving into the Bitcoin market, take the time to educate yourself about the technology, its potential, and the market trends.

        "content": "A widely followed crypto strategist says that Bitcoin (BTC) is likely setting the stage for a steep rally in the coming months as the crypto king shadows a parabolic rally witnessed nearly a decade ago.\n\nPseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 409,100 Twitter followers that multiple technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin could be mimicking its 2015 bull market, a cycle that saw BTC rally from less than $200 to $20,000 in about two years.\n\nThe crypto analyst shares two charts that show how BTC has been following the 2015 cycle over the last year and a half.\n\n\u201cEarly stage of a Bitcoin parabola, following a 1.5-year correction.\u201d\n\nLooking at TechDev\u2019s charts, it appears that BTC has taken out a diagonal resistance that kept Bitcoin bearish in 2022 and retested it as support, which is strikingly similar to the leading digital asset\u2019s price action in 2014 and early 2015.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s charts also show similarities in the movements of two technical indicators: the relative strength index (RSI), which is a momentum indicator, and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), a trend-following indicator.\n\nAccording to the charts, Bitcoin\u2019s weekly RSI has recently broken out of the bullish 60 zone after flashing a bullish divergence, reminiscent of its movement about eight years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the MACD is flashing a bullish cross on BTC\u2019s weekly chart, which is another signal witnessed in the early stages of the 2015 bull market.\n\nTechDev is not the only analyst who believes that BTC could print exponential gains in the coming months. Pseudonymous analyst Credible thinks that BTC could hit $130,000 before the end of the year.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin bulls might be disappointed after the $31,000 resistance proved stronger than expected on April 14. However, looking at a broader time frame, Bitcoin (BTC) has been the best-performing asset in 2023, gaining over 74% year-to-date at $29,000.\n\nPositioning for weaker dollar, debt ceiling\n\nIt is worth noting that gold is merely 4% below its all-time high, likely indicating a weaker United States dollar as investors increase the odds of recession and further fiscal turmoil for the world\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nBehind the bullish price momentum for Bitcoin is the weakness in the U.S. financial system, namely the $100 billion in quarterly net withdrawals at First Republic Bank, and the legislative effort to approve an increase to the national debt ceiling.\n\nFor Bitcoin investors, a financial crisis is a net positive, as it forces the U.S. Federal Reserve to expand its emergency funding programs and take out additional unprofitable long-term debt from the system.\n\nCryptocurrency traders are uncomfortable with the regulatory environment, and the April 25 statement from the New York Federal Reserve further added to the uncertainty. The guidelines disclosed could potentially hinder USD Coin (USDC) issuer Circle\u2019s access to the Fed\u2019s securities reverse-repurchase program, the safest vehicle to get yield on deposits.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to predict how the banking crisis will unfold or the timeline for regulatory actions against exchanges and stablecoin issuers. On the other hand, \u201ceasy money\u201d policies are well known to every investor as extremely beneficial for scarce assets.\n\nSuch a scenario explains why professional traders have been using the bullish \u201ciron condor\u201d strategy to maximize gains if Bitcoin breaks above $32,000 in May with limited risk.\n\nCall and put Bitcoin options to hedge the bet\n\nBuying Bitcoin futures pays off during bull markets, but the issue lies in dealing with liquidations when BTC\u2019s price goes down. This is why pro traders use options strategies to maximize their gains and limit their losses.\n\nThe skewed iron condor strategy can yield profits above $31,400 by the end of May while limiting losses if the expiry price is below $31,000. It is worth noting that Bitcoin traded at $29,730 when the pricing for this model took place.\n\nBitcoin options iron condor strategy returns. Source: Deribit Position Builder\n\nThe call option gives its holder the right to acquire an asset at a fixed price in the future. For this privilege, the buyer pays an upfront fee known as a premium.\n\nMeanwhile, the put option allows its holder to sell an asset at a fixed price in the future, which is a downside protection strategy. On the other hand, selling a put offers exposure to the price upside.\n\nThe iron condor consists of selling the call and put options at the same expiry price and date. The above example has been set using the May 26 contracts, but it can be adapted for other timeframes.\n\nRelated: Kraken asks San Francisco court to intervene against IRS demands\n\nModest 6% Bitcoin price gain needed for profits\n\nAs depicted above, the target profit range is $31,420 (6% above the current $29,730 price) to $36,000 (21.2% above the current price). To initiate the trade, the investor needs to short (sell) 1.5 contracts of the $33,000 call option and three contracts of the $33,000 put option. Then, the investor must repeat the procedure for the $35,000 options, using the same expiry month.\n\nBuying 4.8 contracts of the $31,000 put option to protect from an eventual downside is also required. Lastly, one needs to purchase 7.8 contracts of the $36,000 call option to limit losses above the level.\n\nThis strategy\u2019s net profits peak at 0.225 BTC ($6,685 at current prices) between $33,000 and $36,000, but they remain above 0.063 BTC ($1,750 at current prices) if Bitcoin trades in the $31,850 and $35,700 range.\n\nThe investment required to open this skewed iron condor strategy is the maximum loss \u2014 0.063 BTC, or $1,750 \u2014 which will occur if Bitcoin trades below $31,000 on May 26.\n\nThe benefit of this trade is that a wide target area is covered while providing a potential 357% return versus the potential loss. In essence, it provides a leverage opportunity without the liquidation risks typical of futures contracts.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

But despite the explosive rise and frenzied media coverage of these seemingly new \u201cBitcoin NFTs,\u201d developers have been focused on improving the protocol\u2019s functionality since at least as early as 2012.\n\nIn short, there have always been ways to mint and launch assets on Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain.

To recognize the efforts of developers who have been diligently working on the chain, let\u2019s explore the numerous tools and features that truly constitute the ecosystem.\n\nCounterparty\n\nCounterparty was founded in 2014 by Robert Dermody, Adam Krellenstein, and Evan Wagner.

For example, minting new Bitcoin-based assets isn\u2019t possible with ordinary Bitcoin software.\n\nWhile surpassed by Ethereum and other popular NFT chains in recent years, Counterparty still has an active community of supporters with close to 30,000 Twitter followers and over 100,000 assets \u2014some of which are bridged to Ethereum through the Emblem Vault.\n\nCredit: Rare Pepes\n\nMore importantly, Counterparty is best known as the original home for what eventually came to be known as the \u201cCryptoArt movement\u201d \u2014 a genre of organic, decentralized, and verifiably rare artwork and memes on Bitcoin largely catalyzed through assets like Rare Pepes \u2014 tokenized variations of the Pepe the Frog meme by Matt Furie, which still command significant sums on secondary markets.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nSimilar to how Ethereum token standards define how certain assets work on its protocol, Counterparty provides the infrastructure that outlines how people can create unique tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. These assets aren\u2019t limited to digital collectibles or tokens but anything with a proven rarity \u2014 even physical items.\n\nCounterparty is Bitcoin-native and can embed and use data from the Bitcoin protocol when executing contracts, so transacting on the platform looks just as it would when using BTC. Counterparty nodes simply interpret the data in these transactions based on specific rules. From there, the protocol creates its native ledger of related transactions that it has seen on the underlying Bitcoin network.\n\nAnother way to think about how transactions on Counterparty work is via the concept of Russian nesting dolls, whereby the Bitcoin transaction would contain a smaller Counterparty transaction inside of it. Added complexities aside, the transactions on Counterparty are the same as Bitcoin and, therefore, just as secure.\n\nThat said, a notable difference between Bitcoin and Counterparty is the relationship between nodes. Unlike Bitcoin nodes, Counterparty nodes don\u2019t communicate with each other and don\u2019t offer a \u201cpeer-to-peer network.\u201d While they all share the same code and receive the same transaction data, the primary role of Counterparty nodes is to connect to the Bitcoin software.\n\nOnce connected, the nodes download and decode data from each transaction while benefiting from Bitcoin\u2019s security and computing power. In addition, as with gas on Ethereum, users still need to pay mining fees when transacting on Counterparty.\n\nHow do dispensers work?\n\nBuying and selling assets on Counterparty is often done via automatic dispensers, which work like digital vending machines. Anyone can create a dispenser and decide how much of a token or asset to sell, along with the price in BTC.\n\nBuying assets from these dispensers is akin to transferring tokens between digital wallets. Buyers just need to scan the dispenser\u2019s QR code or enter its wallet address and then send the minimum required amount of BTC for the items they want to buy. The dispenser will then send the asset to the buyer\u2019s wallet.\n\nDispensers are basic smart contracts with set rules that handle and distribute assets independently. To help mitigate scams, a warning sign will show next to an empty dispenser, informing prospective buyers not to send any BTC because the dispenser is closed.\n\nWhat is XCP?\n\nBuying assets on Counterparty can also be done using the platform\u2019s native XCP token. Unlike more conventional methods for launching tokens like crowd sales or initial coin offerings (ICOs), Counterparty used the proof-of-burn (PoB) consensus protocol to issue XCP in January 2014.\n\nTo better secure the network, miners burn some of their coins to acquire a virtual mining rig, granting them the ability and authority to mine blocks on the Counterparty network. The more coins a miner burns, the larger their virtual mining \u201cplatform\u201d becomes.\n\nThe Counterparty team said it settled on PoB to keep the distribution of tokens as fair and decentralized as possible while avoiding potential legal issues. To generate XCP in the network, around 2,140 BTC\u2014valued at over $2 million back then\u2014were destroyed or \u201cburned\u201d by sending them to a provably unspendable Bitcoin address with no known private key, making them permanently lost. The XCP token is also used in various ways in the Counterparty protocol, like helping users create new assets, trade, and make bets. XCP trades on exchanges like Dex-Trade and Zaif, paired with either BTC or the Japanese yen.\n\nWhat are some disadvantages?\n\nCompared to more mainstream marketplaces like OpenSea, where one simply has to connect their MetaMask or Ethereum wallet, the user interface on Counterparty is not as streamlined and requires a few more steps to mint assets. Also, as with gas wars on Ethereum, dispensers can be front-run, with transactions being prioritized over others if people pay higher fees to miners.\n\nOrdinals\n\nExtending on the concept that originated in 2012 is Ordinals. This platform allows people to inscribe messages or images onto the smallest divisible units of Bitcoin, known as Satoshis (named after the pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto). These unique inscriptions can be shared, traded, and preserved directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. As of April 2023, over 1,900,000 Ordinals have been created.\n\nCredit: Ordinal Punks\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the mechanics, each Bitcoin is broken into 100,000,000 units called satoshis (or sats) or 1/100,000,000 of a BTC. Launched on the Bitcoin mainnet, the Ordinals protocol allows people who operate Bitcoin nodes to inscribe each satoshi with data (stored in a Bitcoin transaction\u2019s signature), thus creating what\u2019s known as an Ordinal.\n\nThat data inscribed on Bitcoin can include smart contracts, which, in turn, enables NFTs. In other words, Ordinals are NFTs or digital artifacts like images, text, programs, and video games you can mint or inscribe directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, unlike Counterparty, which functions more like a Layer-2 solution (not directly on the mainnet). Although the idea of inscriptions on Bitcoin isn\u2019t anything new, it is largely possible thanks to the Taproot upgrade introduced on the Bitcoin network on November 14, 2021.\n\nHow are Ordinals different from other NFTs?\n\nDrawing parallels between Ordinals and NFTs can help demystify an inherently complex system, but it\u2019s essential to recognize the subtle distinctions between them. NFTs on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana typically point to off-chain data on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) \u2014 a decentralized storage solution akin to an external hard drive. This approach allows for dynamic metadata updates, making it suitable for projects that need to enhance image quality or alter the appearance of their NFTs over time.\n\nHowever, this ability to change NFT metadata is the setback that Ordinals Rodarmor was trying to improve with the new protocol. According to Rodarmor, NFTs are \u201cincomplete\u201d as they compromise integrity or security with off-chain or external data.\n\nIn comparison, Ordinals are \u201ccomplete\u201d as all the data is inscribed or stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Hence the reason behind naming them \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d rather than Bitcoin NFTs. Another difference is that while most NFTs have creator royalties imbued in the contract or attached to the asset, Ordinals do not. As stated by Rodarmor, an Ordinal \u201cis intended to reflect what NFTs should be, sometimes are, and what inscriptions always are, by their very nature.\u201d\n\nHow to create and trade Ordinals\n\nWhile still burdened by a slight technical barrier, inscribing on Bitcoin is becoming easier. After setting up a wallet, some key methods include:\n\nRun a Bitcoin node and inscribe an Ordinal yourself.\n\nUse a service like Gamma to inscribe an Ordinal without running your node.\n\nThe Satoshibles NFT collection team has created Ordinals Bot, which will inscribe an Ordinal on your behalf.\n\nTypically, these services require users to supply a BTC address to receive the Ordinal, often using an Ordinal-compatible wallet like Sparrow. Users are then informed of the number of satoshis (smaller units of Bitcoin) needed to cover transaction and data fees, as well as a service fee. Payment can be made in BTC, and an address for payment will be provided. The cost of inscribing an Ordinal can vary from under $50 in BTC to several hundred dollars, depending on the file size.\n\nWhat are some disadvantages?\n\nUsers should be mindful that, unlike regular BTC transactions, which usually complete within minutes, the potentially risk-laden process of sending BTC for an Ordinal might take hours or even days to finalize.\n\nHowever, the idea of filling Bitcoin blocks with JPEGs and videos \u2014 or even video games \u2014 isn\u2019t sitting well with some in the Bitcoin community who have voiced concerns that putting NFTs directly on the Bitcoin network will drive up transaction costs.\n\nDespite this divisiveness, Ordinals are another method for anyone to preserve their messages for posterity. Some technologists and developers have even started to find and inscribe satoshis with a specific historical date and inscribe unique messages on them with important historical data or facts that would be subverted through conventional mainstream media.\n\nBitcoin Stamps\n\nNext up is Bitcoin Stamps. One disadvantage and misnomer in the broader NFT world (including Ordinals) is that storing \u201cart on the Blockchain\u201d is enough to achieve permanence. The reality is that most NFTs are merely image pointers to centralized hosting or stored on-chain in prunable witness data.\n\nBitcoin Stamps proposes a method of embedding base64-formatted image data using transaction outputs in a novel fashion. To put it more simply, Bitcoin Stamps are digital collectibles similar to ERC-1155 semi-fungible tokens stored on Bitcoin\u2019s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) instead of witness data like Ordinals.\n\nCredit: Bitcoin Stamps\n\nBitcoin Stamps abide by the following rules:\n\nA Bitcoin Stamp has to be a numeric asset, like this: [A1997663462583877600].\n\nYou can create a Bitcoin Stamp from an existing numeric asset that wasn\u2019t a stamp before. To do this, update the asset to include the stamp:base64 string in a new transaction.\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t duplicate Bitcoin Stamps on the same asset. If an asset is already a stamp, changing the description field to a new base64 string won\u2019t make it a new stamp. A new STAMP transaction will still be created on the blockchain, but the official STAMPS project won\u2019t index it. This is to maintain a one-to-one relationship with the first created stamp.\n\n\n\nThe image data should be in jpg, png, gif, or webP format and encoded in base64.\n\nHow do Stamps differ from Ordinals?\n\nThere are several ways in which Stamps differ from Ordinals:\n\nStorage: Bitcoin Stamps are stored on Bitcoin\u2019s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), while Ordinals are stored in the witness data.\n\nProtocol: Bitcoin Stamps use the Counterparty protocol, an open-source messaging protocol built on the Bitcoin blockchain, whereas Ordinals are not mentioned to use this protocol. Furthermore, Stamps is using Counterparty bare multi-sig transactions for minting Bitcoin Stamps, allowing users to securely send BTC to a script-linked address.\n\nMinting cost: The cost of minting Bitcoin Stamps is approximately four times higher than inscribing Ordinals. However, Counterparty allows for more flexibility in minting larger quantities, which can lead to economies of scale.\n\nImmutability: The encoded image data for Bitcoin Stamps live in the transaction outputs on the Bitcoin blockchain, requiring Bitcoin nodes to download all the data to maintain the blockchain. In contrast, Ordinals\u2019 image data lives in witness data, creating an environment where the image data can be pruned.\n\nFlexibility: Counterparty provides less user friction in minting a 1:1 or 1:100 at any given time, giving it more feature-rich capabilities for on-chain Bitcoin protocols than Ordinals.\n\nGrowth rate: Bitcoin Stamps have been growing faster than Ordinals, likely due to the flexibility of minting larger quantities.\n\nTo mint Bitcoin Stamps, an image is converted to text, encoded as a Base64 file, and broadcasted to the Bitcoin network using the Counterparty protocol. The data is then recompiled to recreate the original image.\n\nWhat are some disadvantages?\n\nSome controversy around Bitcoin Stamps revolves around data permanence, UTXO set bloating, and disagreement about using block space for digital artwork. But, as with Ordinals, despite these debates, the emergence of Bitcoin Stamps once again highlights the capabilities of the Bitcoin blockchain as builders continue to develop new applications and improve user experience.\n\nNostr\n\nAnother platform that leverages the functionality of Ordinals is Nostr, a decentralized social network launched in 2021 by Bitcoin developer Joost Jager. Nostr enables users to post messages and content directly on the blockchain (using the Ordinals system) in a censorship-resistant manner, free from the constraints of any central authority or algorithmic censorship otherwise rampant on platforms like Twitter and Meta.\n\nWhile still growing in adoption, the importance of Nostr invariably lies in its ability to foster an environment where free speech and expression can thrive unimpeded by the whims of centralized powers. In a world where information is increasingly controlled and manipulated, Nostr offers a platform that upholds democracy, transparency, and autonomy, allowing users to engage in open discourse, share ideas, and collaborate without fear of censorship.\n\nIn other words, this decentralized approach \u2014 tapping into the censorship-resistant nature of the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 can reshape the way we interact online, giving voice to the voiceless and paving the way for a more equitable digital landscape.\n\nA promising future\n\nWhile lacking in comparative volume when compared with Ethereum, the steady rise of creativity and versatility on the Bitcoin blockchain means that developers and creators are offered a wider array of choices for free expression online. Moreover, being classified as a commodity by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in September 2015 further bolsters Bitcoin\u2019s role in championing freedom. This classification affords it greater autonomy and less stringent regulations than other cryptocurrencies deemed securities, enabling users to express themselves more openly through the network.\n\nAs the network expands with new nodes and as more users join to explore and engage with various concepts across all layers, the ecosystem becomes increasingly secure and decentralized. And it is through such innovative tools that we inch closer to a balanced and equitable digital landscape where every user has the opportunity to thrive and thus foster an environment where more individuals can advance the cause of liberty in the digital age."

        "content": "This market analysis explains why Bitcoin might have a hard time securing liquidity.\n\nWhales and institutions demonstrated outflows as the market showed a bleak outlook.\n\nIt was observed that Bitcoin [BTC] and altcoins were on a slippery slope for the last few days.

While this outcome stimulated the bulls, it will likely be a temporary move once the FED has limited cash reserves to tap into.\n\nWill the liquidity taps run dry?\n\nTedtalksmacro\u2019s assessment highlighted the risk of a liquidity crunch if U.S. runs out of cash reserves. When that happens, the U.S. will have to raise its debt ceiling. This is to raise funds through debt instruments such as treasury bills.\n\nDoing so will lead to more quantitative tightening, which will in turn have a negative impact on higher-risk investments such as Bitcoin.\n\n2/ The recent surge in global liquidity has been owed to: \u2013 US debt ceiling situation \u2013> Treasury drawing down on their cash reserves,\n\n\u2013 Banking crisis \u2013> Fed balance sheet expansion to backstop failing banks,\n\n\u2013 China restarting their economy post-COVID \u2013> stimulate with $$ pic.twitter.com/7NVjHeC8v6 \u2014 tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) April 25, 2023\n\nThe above analysis may explain why the market is experiencing a slowdown in the level of liquidity coming into it.

They contributed significant liquidity to BTC from the second week of March to mid-April. However, post-mid-April results indicated some liquidity outflows.\n\nThis analysis underscores a strong reason for investors to keep tabs on FED activity as it may offer insights into the next market move."

        "content": "What is the Bitcoin Whitepaper and why does it matter? Today we cover what it is.\n\nImagine a world where financial transactions are secure, fast, and free from intermediaries. A world where you have complete control over your money and can send it to anyone, anywhere, at any time\n\nIt sounds like a utopian dream, right?\n\nWell, guess what?\n\nThis dream has already become a reality thanks to a revolutionary invention known as Bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back and understand the foundation of this digital revolution: the Bitcoin whitepaper.\n\nIn October 2008, a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto released a nine-page document titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d\n\nThis document, now commonly known as the Bitcoin Whitepaper, laid the groundwork for creating the first-ever cryptocurrency.\n\nTo this day, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery.\n\nHowever, the revolutionary ideas presented in the whitepaper have profoundly impacted the worlds of finance and technology.\n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper birthed the first cryptocurrency and sparked the entire blockchain industry, leading to over 4,000 unique cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe will examine the whitepaper\u2019s fundamental ideas, their significance in the crypto world, and their ongoing importance.\n\nSource: News18\n\nWhat is the famous Bitcoin paper? Key concepts explained\n\nYou might be wondering, \u201cWhat is the Bitcoin Whitepaper?\u201d\n\nSimply put, it is a document that details the technical aspects, philosophy, and purpose behind the invention of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper explains how Bitcoin works through decentralization, the blockchain, cryptographic hashing, and proof of work (PoW).\n\nDecentralization is key, as it removes the need for a central authority and instead relies on a network of nodes to validate and record transactions on the blockchain. This distributed system ensures resistance to censorship, fraud, and corruption.\n\nThe blockchain is a vital component of the Bitcoin system. It is a continuously growing ledger of transactions, grouped into blocks, and secured using cryptography.\n\nBlocks in the blockchain contain a list of transactions and unique identifiers. Each block\u2019s hash is linked to the previous block, creating an immutable chain.\n\nThis design provides tamper resistance, as changing a block requires changing all subsequent blocks, which is computationally infeasible.\n\nThe whitepaper also introduced Proof of Work, a consensus algorithm that uses miners to solve mathematical problems and validate transactions.\n\nThis process secures the network and ensures new coins\u2019 fair and transparent distribution.\n\nThe importance of a whitepaper in the cryptocurrency world\n\nNow that you know the answer to \u201cWhat is the famous Bitcoin paper?\u201d let\u2019s discuss the role of whitepapers in the broader cryptocurrency industry.\n\nA whitepaper is crucial to creating and launching any new cryptocurrency or blockchain-based project.\n\nIt is a comprehensive guide that provides potential investors, developers, and users with a clear understanding of the project\u2019s goals, technology, and roadmap.\n\nA well-written whitepaper should cover several key aspects, including the problem the project aims to solve, the proposed solution, the technology and architecture behind it, the tokenomics (i.e., the distribution, allocation, and use of tokens), the team and their qualifications, and the project\u2019s roadmap and milestones.\n\nBy providing this information, a whitepaper helps build trust and credibility, as it demonstrates the team\u2019s commitment to transparency and allows potential investors to make informed decisions.\n\nIn the fast-paced and often volatile world of cryptocurrencies, whitepapers play a vital role in helping investors and users differentiate between legitimate projects and scams.\n\nA poorly written or incomplete whitepaper may indicate that the project is poorly thought out or lacks the necessary resources to succeed.\n\nOn the other hand, a well-researched and professionally presented whitepaper can generate excitement and attract funding and community support, propelling the project toward success.\n\nSource: TechStory\n\nWhy is the whitepaper important in crypto? Its impact on the industry\n\nFirst, the significance of the Bitcoin whitepaper cannot be overstated.\n\nSecond, it has laid the foundation for the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and inspired countless innovations and new projects in the blockchain space.\n\nThe impact of the whitepaper is evident in the rapid growth and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, which have the potential to disrupt various industries, from finance and supply chain management to healthcare and gaming.\n\nBy introducing the concept of decentralized, trustless systems, the Bitcoin whitepaper has challenged traditional financial institutions and paved the way for the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nAs a result, DeFi platforms leverage blockchain technology to offer financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors.\n\nThis can increase financial inclusion, reduce fees, and empower individuals to take control of their financial lives.\n\nMoreover, the whitepaper has inspired the development of various blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, that enable the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.\n\nThese innovations have expanded the use cases of blockchain technology beyond mere cryptocurrencies. They are opening up new possibilities for solving complex problems and driving efficiency across various sectors.\n\nConclusion: The ongoing significance of the Bitcoin whitepaper\n\nIn conclusion, the Bitcoin whitepaper remains influential.\n\nIt inspires new ideas in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.\n\nIts principles are relevant in today\u2019s digital world.\n\nUnderstanding its technical aspects is essential to navigating cryptocurrencies and identifying promising projects."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in the opposite direction to the dollar index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro.\n\nThe negative correlation has strengthened, reversing the brief let up witnessed in late March, and indicating scope for accelerated gains in the cryptocurrency in the case of a continued dollar slide following the release of the U.S. GDP data on Thursday.\n\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the dollar index has slipped to a two-month low of -0.70, according to data from charting platform TradingView. It had weakened to -0.11 four weeks ago.\n\nCorrelations are measured on a scale of -1 to +1. Values skewed towards -1 indicate that lower prices for one variable are associated with higher prices for the other.\n\nBitcoin and the DXY have been mostly negatively correlated over the past three years, except in times where crypto-specific factors overshadowed the dollar trends. For instance, bitcoin fell in late 2022 as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX kept investors from cheering weakness in the U.S. currency. A similar breakdown was seen in the lead up to Coinbase's Nasdaq debut in April 2021 and the launch of a futures-based exchange-traded fund in the U.S. the following October.\n\nFocus on GDP\n\nAt 12:30 UTC, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its preliminary estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP). The data is likely to show the world's largest economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.0%, a slower pace than the 2.6% of fourth-quarter 2022, according to Reuters estimates published by FXStreet.\n\nSeveral economic indicators and bond market metrics have been warning of an economic recession for months. The dollar index has declined by over 12% since early October in hopes that the Federal Reserve would halt interest rate hikes and resort to liquidity easing to support the economy.\n\nBesides, traders are back to pricing three interest-rate cuts by year-end in the wake of issues at First Republic Bank, even though the Fed did not cut rates and maintained a hawkish or anti-stimulus bias following the much severe banking crisis episode of March.\n\nWith so much dovish expectations already in the air, the GDP figure might have to indicate a sharper-than-expected moderation in economic activity to trigger a deeper dollar sell-off and rally in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt also means that a upbeat figure may see markets price out rate cuts and lift the dollar higher.\n\n\"The market eyes growth at 2% \u2013 shouldn't move markets too intently given the backward nature of the data point \u2013 would need to be a big beat/miss to the move rates expectations and the USD, gold, Nasdaq,\" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said in a tweet.\n\nAt press time, bitcoin changed hands at $29,010, representing a 2% gain on the day. The dollar index was little changed at 101.50.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Coindesk"

All rights reserved.\n\nAn American bitcoin mining company claims creating the world's largest cryptocurrency produces no greenhouse gases. This is false; the process requires a significant amount of energy, experts say -- which can come from carbon-emitting sources such as natural gas or coal-fired power plants.\n\n\"Bitcoin mining has zero carbon emissions,\" says an April 10, 2023 tweet from Riot Platforms Inc.\n\nThe post includes a video of a man testing for emissions outside a bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas.\n\nScreenshot of a tweet taken April 21, 2023\n\nRiot published the clip in response to an April 9 New York Times article about the environmental cost of bitcoin mining in the US. The video accumulated more than 1.3 million views.\n\n\"We're here out in Rockdale, Texas,\" Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot, says in the footage, displaying a device measuring carbon dioxide. \"We're going to go inside the mining facility and we're going to see how much is this number going to go up. If the number does not go up, then the mining rigs are not emitting any CO2.\"\n\nAfter checking readings outside and inside the facility, Rochard claims this data proves that bitcoin mining \"does not emit any CO2.\"\n\n\"I think the science is conclusive,\" he says.\n\nThe company also issued a press release (archived here) with a more detailed explanation.\n\n\"To be clear, our Bitcoin mining operations do not generate any greenhouse gas emissions, similar to any other data center for Facebook, Amazon or Google -- yet we have been singled out,\" the statement says. \"Our data center uses electricity from the Texas grid, which is the cleanest and most renewable energy-sourced grid in the United States.\"\n\nBut bitcoin mining does have a carbon footprint, experts told AFP. Centers creating the cryptocurrency require massive amounts of energy, not all of which is sustainable.\n\nWhat is bitcoin mining?\n\nThe only way to make bitcoin is by using a network of powerful computers to solve complex mathematical questions.\n\nThe first computer that solves the problem unlocks the next block of bitcoins that are released into circulation. Then the cycle starts over again as computers attempt to find the next block.\n\nMargot Paez, a climate adaptation fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, compared the bitcoin mining process to a \"game\" or \"a puzzle.\"\n\n\"Each computer is like a lottery ticket,\" she said. \"That means if there are 100 computers on the network trying to win the game of getting the reward -- the bitcoin is the reward -- my one computer has, all things being equal, a 1/100 chance of winning.\"\n\nPower hungry\n\nBitcoin mining facilities have multiplied in the US since China halted the activity in 2021 -- and they consume a lot of energy.\n\nThe Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates that the bitcoin network has an annual electricity consumption of 145 Terawatt hours (TWh).\n\n\"To put this into perspective, this level of energy consumption would place bitcoin among the top 30 energy-consuming nations globally,\" said Fengqi You, an energy systems engineering professor at Cornell University.\n\nThe White House issued a press release in September 2022 warning about the increased demand for cryptocurrency and its implications for US climate goals.\n\n\"The United States is estimated to host about a third of global crypto-asset operations, which currently consume about 0.9 percent to 1.7 percent of total US electricity usage,\" the statement says. \"This range of electricity usage is similar to all home computers or residential lighting in the United States.\"\n\nThe White House said that \"depending on the energy intensity of the technology and the sources of electricity used, the rapid growth of crypto-assets could potentially hinder broader efforts to achieve US climate commitments to reach net-zero carbon pollution.\"\n\nHigh footprint\n\nLena Klaassen, a doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich's Climate Finance and Policy Group, said Riot's claim \"is not correct as bitcoin miners are also relying on power sources from fossil fuels.\"\n\nIf the computers are powered by solar or wind, then the facility would \"be considered carbon-free,\" said You of Cornell. However, if a power plant burning fossil fuels is generating the energy, then he said \"we can't consider bitcoin mining free from any carbon emissions.\"\n\nThe Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute ranks Riot's operation as the fifth most carbon-intensive of all leading bitcoin mining companies. Riot also claims its Rockdale center is the \"largest bitcoin mining facility\" in the US.\n\nThe New York Times and WattTime, an environmental technology nonprofit, estimated the facility contributes 1.9 million tons of carbon emissions per year.\n\nRiot's mining site gets its energy from Texas's ERCOT grid, whose power sources in 2021 comprised 61 percent fossil fuels and 28 percent wind and solar, according to the state comptroller's office.\n\nWhile Texas is a leader in renewable energy production, the state still relies on fossil fuels and says they will remain \"a crucial part of the energy mix for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nA greener bitcoin mining process may become possible as the power grid gets more sustainable, according to Klaassen of ETH Zurich. But she warned that \"until then, consuming large amounts of electricity in a grid that does not fully run on renewable energy sources will be associated with causing emissions.\"\n\nAFP has fact-checked other claims about carbon emissions here, here and here."

        "title": "Bitcoin Accumulation: HODLers Are Buying 15,000 BTC Per Month - NewsBTC",
        "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin HODLers are currently displaying net accumulation behavior, as they grow their holdings by 15,000 BTC per month.\n\nBitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Accumulating Recently\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, these investors were previously aggressively distributing during the bear market lows. The HODLers, or more formally, the \u201clong-term holders\u201d (LTHs), make up a Bitcoin cohort that includes all investors that have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago.\n\nThe LTHs make up one of the two main holder groups in the market; the other cohort is called the \u201cshort-term holder\u201d (STH) group and naturally includes only investors that bought their BTC less than 155 days ago.\n\nStatistically speaking, the longer a holder owns a coin, the less likely they become to sell it at any point. This means that the LTHs are the more resolute bunch of the two groups, which is why they are called the \u201cHODLers\u201d or the diamond hands of the market.\n\nAs these investors are an important part of the sector, their movements can be worth tracking. An indicator called the \u201cHODLer net position change\u201d measures the monthly rate at which these investors are buying or selling a net amount of Bitcoin right now.\n\nThe chart below shows the trend in this metric over the last few years:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been green in recent months | Source: Glassnode on Twitter\n\nWhen the HODLer net position change has a positive value, it means these investors are receiving inflows into their holdings currently. On the other hand, negative values suggest a net number of coins are exiting the supply of the LTHs.\n\nAs displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin HODLer net position change had a deep red value during the bear market lows that followed the November 2022 FTX crash. This means that the LTHs had been selling during this period.\n\nThis sharp negative spike has been an exception to the long-term trend, however, as the HODLers have actually been showing an overall strong accumulation behavior over the past couple of years. The last time these investors participated in consistent distribution was during the bull rally in the first half of 2021.\n\nFrom the chart, it\u2019s visible that after the aforementioned brief period of distribution at the bear market lows, the LTHs switched back to accumulation just before the current rally began.\n\nThese diamond hands have continued to add to their holdings throughout the rally so far, showing that they haven\u2019t been allured by the profit-taking opportunity. This can be a bullish sign for the long-term sustainability of the rally.\n\nThough, very recently, the monthly amount that they have been adding to their holdings has been trending down. Nonetheless, the indicator\u2019s value still remains positive, as the Bitcoin LTHs are accumulating at a rate of 15,000 BTC per month currently.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,100, up 1% in the last week.\n\nBTC has seen some heavy fluctuations during the past day | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Top 5 Bitcoin Alternatives in the Crypto Space at the Moment - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Check out the list of the top 5 Bitcoin alternatives in the crypto space at the moment\n\nEven though Bitcoin isn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency option, the term \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d has almost become synonymous with it. There are several other options to think about if you are already investing in crypto or are considering doing so.\n\nFor those looking for the best cryptocurrencies, let\u2019s take a look at 5 Bitcoin alternatives in the crypto space.\n\nBe that as it may, a note before we make a plunge: digital currencies are incredibly unpredictable and not suggested over different types of ventures like stocks and bonds. But before we get into the best cryptocurrencies, let\u2019s first take a look at what\u2019s going on in the cryptocurrency industry right now if you\u2019re interested in making this high-risk investment.\n\nEthereum (ETH):\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is an open-source network that is managed by users. It is the second most popular cryptocurrency. Notwithstanding, there are likewise a few huge contrasts. \u201cSmart contracts,\u201d written in computer code and uploaded to the blockchain, are how the network and other cryptocurrency function. Ethereum as of now doesn\u2019t sell as high as Bitcoin, with its value (as of Walk 2023) at US$1,641.82.\n\nRipple (XRP):\n\nAlthough many people like the concept of cryptocurrencies, they are concerned about the safety of their money in an unregulated online environment. Ripple aims to provide a portion of that security. Ripple is a global network that handles money transfers and currency exchange. Ripple, in contrast to the majority of other cryptocurrencies, does not require \u201cmining.\u201d\n\nLitecoin (LTC):\n\nLitecoin is very similar to Bitcoin, but one of its biggest advantages is that it speeds up transactions. Nonetheless, there has been a conversation concerning whether this speed makes Litecoin less secure. As of April 2023, the price of Litecoin is US$89.26, down 78% from its all-time high. The fact that LTC has been around since 2015 and is regarded as stable is one potential advantage of investing in it.\n\nCardano (ADA):\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform based on proof-of-stake. It is intended to be the next generation of the Ethereum network, featuring a scalable platform for running smart contracts and a flexible blockchain. Cardano was introduced as a useful Bitcoin alternative and an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nBinance Coin (BNB):\n\nThe Binance Coin serves as the medium of exchange for the entire network, making Binance one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. You can utilize your Binance Coin to exchange and pay expenses on the Binance digital money trade. You can likewise utilize BNB on the BNB Chain biological system.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Examining The Impact Of Bitcoin Halving On Its Market Performance: A Comparative Analysis With Big Eyes Coin - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As the cryptocurrency market draws the attention of investors and researchers, the impending Bitcoin halving event has raised the question of whether it is responsible for the newfound strength of the cryptocurrency. This article delves into a comparative analysis of Bitcoin and the emerging cryptocurrency Big Eyes Coin (BIG), examining the similarities and differences between the two and assessing the impact of Bitcoin\u2019s halving event on the wider crypto market.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 A Trailblazer in the World of Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates autonomously without any centralized authority, government, or financial institution like central banks overseeing its transactions. It utilizes peer-to-peer software and cryptography to enable secure and safe transactions. All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called blockchain, which ensures the integrity of the BTC and prevents double-spending.\n\nSince its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has grown to become the most widely used and valuable cryptocurrency in the digital realm. As of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $29,906 with a market capitalization of over $578 billion.\n\nExplained: The Concept of Bitcoin Halving and Its Significance in the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nBitcoin halving is a significant event that takes place approximately every four years on the Bitcoin network. During this event, the rewards for miners who add new blocks to the blockchain are halved, resulting in fewer tokens earned for their work. This process is a deliberate attempt to regulate the number of new Bitcoins entering the market, which is capped at 21 million. The halving process is designed to restrict the number of Bitcoins that can be mined, leading to an anticipated increase in demand, which could ultimately result in a rise in the value of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin has undergone three halving events so far in 2012, 2016, and 2020. The next Bitcoin halving is scheduled to take place in April 2024.\n\nThe Importance of Bitcoin Halving: Understanding Its Significance for the Cryptocurrency Market\n\nDuring the halving cycle, the available supply of Bitcoin tokens decreases, leading to a potential increase in the value of yet-to-be-mined coins. The first halving event in November 2012 resulted in Bitcoin\u2019s value skyrocketing from around $12 to almost $1,000 within a year. In the most recent halving in May 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price was $8,787, but it experienced a significant surge in value in the following months, highlighting the potential for substantial changes in the cryptocurrency market after each halving event.\n\nMaximize Your Earnings with the END300 Code\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a newly launched meme coin that has gained popularity due to its unique cat-themed design and features. Running on the Ethereum blockchain, the Big Eyes Coin uses the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, resulting in lower energy consumption and mining costs compared to Bitcoin.\n\nThe project aims to make a positive impact on the world by allocating 5% of its supply to charities focused on ocean conservation. Big Eyes Coin has already raised over $34 million by the 13th stage of the presale, and the project team is now offering new incentives to attract more investors before the presale ends on June 3rd.\n\nCurrently, the project offers a rare opportunity to receive a 300% bonus by using the code END300 when purchasing BIG tokens or Loot Boxes.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin\u2019s price and adoption have been significantly affected by the halving event. However, as Big Eyes Coin operates on the PoS algorithm, its mining rewards are based on the number of coins held by miners, rather than computational power. Consequently, the impact of the Bitcoin halving event on Big Eyes Coin may be minimal.\n\nDespite having a lower adoption rate compared to Bitcoin, Big Eyes Coin\u2019s popularity among investors and traders is on the rise due to its potential for growth and low transaction fees.\n\nFor More On Big Eyes Coin (BIG):\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nOpensea: https://opensea.io/collection/big-eyes-lootbox-cards\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "On Monday, Standard Chartered suggested that Bitcoin may hit $100,000 by the end of 2024 as it emerges from what was commonly referred to as the \"crypto winter.\" According to Geoff Kendrick, the bank's head of digital assets research, several factors could contribute to the increase in Bitcoin's price, including the recent banking sector turmoil, the stabilization of risk assets due to the conclusion of the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike cycle, and the increased profitability of crypto mining.\n\nAlthough some uncertainties persist, Kendrick believes that the path to the $100,000 mark is becoming clearer. After trillions of dollars were lost in the crypto sector in 2022, Bitcoin has rebounded this year, breaking $30,000 in April for the first time in ten months.\n\nIn the past, there have been numerous predictions of sky-high valuations during Bitcoin's rallies. A Citi analyst predicted in November 2020 that Bitcoin could climb as high as $318,000 by the end of 2022. Last year, however, it closed down about 65 per cent at $16,500.\n\nALSO READ: Why Bitcoin Is Seeing A Surge In 2023. What Investors Should Keep In Mind\n\nIn a note on Monday, Standard Chartered stated that Bitcoin's perceived relative store of value, status as a branded safe haven, and means of remittance have all contributed to its success. Furthermore, Kendrick believes that the European Parliament's recent endorsement of the EU's first set of rules to regulate crypto asset markets will provide a tailwind for Bitcoin.\n\nOn April 5, JPMorgan published a note stating that a technical change to the Bitcoin blockchain, known as its \"halving,\" in April 2024 could increase its price by making it more expensive to produce, resulting in a \"positive psychological effect.\" According to JPMorgan, cryptocurrency prices have already benefited from crypto enthusiasts interpreting the recent US banking crisis as a \"vindication of the crypto ecosystem.\" Stablecoins are thought to be \"less susceptible to runs,\" according to crypto supporters, according to JPMorgan.\n\nEXPLAINED: Crypto Winter: What Is It? How Is It Connected To 'Game Of Thrones'? Does It Have Any Advantages?\n\nUS regulators have previously cautioned banks to be vigilant for liquidity risks arising from crypto-related deposits, such as stablecoin reserves, which may be subject to rapid outflows.\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky. There may be no regulatory recourse for any loss from such transactions. Cryptocurrency is not a legal tender and is subject to market risks. Readers are advised to seek expert advice and read offer document(s) along with related important literature on the subject carefully before making any kind of investment whatsoever.

        "title": "Rajagopal Menon, vice president, WazirX on Bitcoin or Ethereum, which is a better choice of investment - The Financial Express",
        "content": "For cryptocurrency traders perhaps one of the biggest challenges resides in selecting between Bitcoin and Ether. Reports from Investopedia, a financial media platform, include that currently Bitcoin and Ether are among the popular digital currency. As per CoinMarketCap, a crypto price-tracking platform, the current market value of Bitcoin stands at $28,425.16 (April 26, 2023, 08:40 am IST) and Ether stands at $1,868.09(April 26, 2023, 08:40 am IST).\n\nInitially, both cryptocurrencies were made to store and preserve data in a secure manner. With time, people began to realise that more things could be done with the help of this programmable money. Vitalik Butalin, creator of Ethereum, realised that Bitcoin has limitations and so he created his own crypto Ether (ETH). Eventually, Ethereum opened a new way of working with digital currencies by using the working mechanism of Proof-of-Stake (PoS). In a conversation with FE Blockchain\u2019s Poulami Saha, Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, talks about currently which crypto is better to invest in. (Edited excerpts)\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin popular among other cryptos?\n\nDigital currency was introduced in the \u201990s. By then people already started experimenting with cryptocurrencies. However, in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced us to a digital currency that could provide safety and help solve many other problems. Bitcoin is considered as one of the oldest cryptocurrencies. What makes Bitcoin special is that Satoshi Nakamoto created it and left it for growing organically. Apart from that Bitcoin works in a decentralised manner which might not be easy to hack when it comes to safety. Also, its Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism adds to its security. Moreover, we can say that Bitcoin is popular for its authenticity.\n\nCan the working mechanism of Bitcoin affect its popularity, when it comes to the ability to adapt to changes?\n\nAdaptation to changes may need the involvement of many hands, which might affect the security of these networks. However, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralised working mechanism does not allow such involvement. Since its creation, nothing has changed and no one can control it. Probably, this makes it one of the safest networks in the blockchain. Therefore, Bitcoin has been able to provide some sort of assurance to its users which I guess contributes to its popularity.\n\nEthereum is supposed to be more versatile then why it\u2019s still in the second position?\n\nThe working mechanism of Ethereum which is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) makes it very adaptive to new technologies such as smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) among others. But Ethereum is also considered just as a security network by many. It is a security network that might fluctuate due to its unknown scalability. However, Bitcoin has become more of a commodity. The users are more comfortable using Bitcoins due to their unchangeable monetary value. It is already known that there are about 21 million Bitcoins and its monetary policy can\u2019t be changed.\n\nWith the adoption of automatic technologies and smart contracts do you think Ethereum will lead the crypto market?\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency is quite unpredictable as crypto is a constantly evolving space and the popularity of these cryptocurrencies depends on the purpose that it is used for. Bitcoin promises strong security and storing values and Ether can be considered as the \u2018Future of the financial system\u2019. Reportedly, the current Shanghai upgradation seems to have contributed to the popularity of Ether. Experts believe that Ethereum with constant upgradation could create an impact in the long run.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "title": "Apple is drifting away it's own Bitcoin wallet - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "For years now the speculation has been circulating that Apple may create its own wallet for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and with the discovery a few weeks ago this idea seemed to have been strengthened.\n\nIn fact, in early April it was discovered that the Bitcoin whitepaper PDF was included in every copy of macOS as of 2018.\n\nWhile this was only a hidden inclusion, probably the result of the independent initiative of an individual developer at the company and not the company itself, it had suggested that perhaps Apple had changed its mind about cryptocurrencies.\n\nMoreover, there had also been speculation in December that Apple would open its ecosystem to crypto and NTFs as well, thanks to new EU regulations.\n\nIn other words, everything seemed all set for a possible step forward by the company in this regard, but instead, a step backward arrived.\n\nThe removal of Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper PDF\n\nYesterday, the dedicated news website for the Mac, 9to5mac.com, reported that Apple has removed the Bitcoin whitepaper from the latest macOS beta, called Ventura.\n\nSo after the discovery in early April, the company ran for cover by removing that PDF, probably precisely in response to the speculation triggered by that news about its possible move into the crypto world.\n\nApple has never officially disclosed why Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s whitepaper was present in macOS, but 9to5mac argues that it was probably just some sort of prank by the engineers who worked on building the operating system.\n\nTo tell the truth, the PDF was not simply removed, or replaced with another PDF, but disappeared because Apple removed the internal tool called VirtualScanner that contained the PDF.\n\nAccording to 9to5mac, that hidden tool should never have been discovered and made public, and it had not yet been removed as of 2018 because it did not include sensitive information.\n\nSo Apple did not backtrack on the inclusion of the Bitcoin whitepaper in macOS, but it did remove a hidden tool that contained it and that it had probably just forgotten to remove earlier.\n\nDespite this, it seems unlikely that the news of the whitepaper\u2019s inclusion in macOS did not play a key role in this affair, in part because perhaps someone knew of the VirtualScanner\u2019s existence even before it was made public that it contained Satoshi\u2019s PDF.\n\nThe long history between Apple and Bitcoin\n\nSo far the company has always kept its distance from Bitcoin and the crypto world, although over the years there seemed to be some glimmer of rapprochement.\n\nFor example, in May two years ago it was discovered that Apple was looking for a business development manager in the \u201calternative payments\u201d sector, which had hinted at an entry into the crypto sector as a possible technical player.\n\nIt is worth noting that the last big bull run was underway at the time, and from 2022 onward nothing more was heard of this.\n\nHowever, in November 2021 it was discovered that the company\u2019s current CEO, Tim Cook, had invested in cryptocurrencies. Indeed, he had even stated that everyone should look with interest at the crypto sector.\n\nThis seemed like a real, definitive opening, but apparently it was not followed through.\n\nIt is probably no coincidence at all that these supposed openings occurred precisely in 2021, when the hype toward cryptocurrencies was very high. Indeed, with the bear-market of 2022 everything fell back.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that for now it seems that the company has not yet objected to linking its Apple Pay Wallet to crypto debit cards, which actually allows people to pay in cryptocurrencies using their wallet, albeit indirectly.\n\nApple\u2019s wallet: only fintech, but no crypto\n\nIn reality, Apple\u2019s wallet, which allows payments with various credit and debit cards, is not a crypto wallet at all, neither directly nor indirectly.\n\nWhat is indirectly related to crypto are some debit cards that allow fiat currency payments that can be topped up using cryptocurrencies.\n\nThus, these are the ones that are connected to the crypto world, and not Apple\u2019s wallet that merely withdraws funds in fiat currency from crypto debit cards.\n\nHowever, what does create food for thought is the fact that the company is not opposed to this kind of use of its wallet, even though it has been known for some time now.\n\nSo while it does not seem that Apple has yet made any real concrete steps to enter the crypto sector, it does seem that it does not want to oppose these new technologies.\n\nIf anything, it is very likely that Apple is studying crypto with interest, as also shown by the clear, overt, and direct interest of its CEO.\n\nAt this time it does not seem possible to rule out a priori that sooner or later Apple\u2019s wallet may also directly integrate Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, although it will most likely take some more time.\n\nThe departure hypothesis\n\nAt this point the hypothesis of Apple\u2019s departure from the crypto world does not seem so credible.\n\nThe main reason for the possible strengthening of this hypothesis, namely the removal of Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper, seems to be due more to a desire to remove a tool that should have remained hidden rather than to a distancing from Bitcoin.\n\nThe fact that the company is not objecting to the use of crypto cards in its wallet reiterates that Apple does not appear to be hostile to the crypto world at all.\n\nWhile the company stopped revealing details linking it to this world in 2022 when the hype dissipated, should the hype return, it may become involved again.\n\nIn short, everything suggests that Apple is not distancing itself from Bitcoin at all.\n\nApple\u2019s possible Bitcoin wallet\n\nInstead, the hypothesis that has been circulating for some time is that Apple may decide at some point to offer its users, especially iPhone users, crypto trading financial services.\n\nAlready to date, there are plenty of Apple users trading crypto on their iPhones, but using apps that have nothing to do with Apple itself.\n\nThis is a real business that the company may want to get into, perhaps through a partnership with some institutional player in the industry, such as Gemini or Coinbase.\n\nTo be honest, it seems rather unlikely that Apple will continue to steer clear of crypto markets, although that does not at all mean that it is likely to develop and release its own wallet for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt is worth noting that its main rival in this regard, Samsung, has already equipped its high-end devices with a crypto wallet, so in the event of success it is extremely difficult to imagine Apple choosing to leave the field to its competitors.\n\nHowever, to date it does not appear that Samsung\u2019s crypto wallet has been a great success, and this effectively grants Apple the luxury of being able to stay out of it."

        "title": "Coincidence? Bitcoin developer visited CIA, then Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Twelve years ago, Gavin Andresen, a former lead Bitcoin (BTC) developer, announced to the cryptocurrency community at the Bitcoin Talk forum that he was going to visit the headquarters of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which coincided with the disappearance of the Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIndeed, after first surfacing in 2008 with the publication of the Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi mysteriously vanished in 2011, at around the same time when Andresen intended to give a presentation about Bitcoin at the CIA headquarters, which he announced in a Bitcoin Talk forum post on April 27, 2011, exactly 12 years ago to this day.\n\nAndresen announces visit to CIA\n\nAccording to Andresen\u2019s post at the time, he had expected that his visit would spark conspiracy theories, which is why he wanted to \u201cget [it] out in the open\u201d that he was going to \u201cgive a presentation about Bitcoin at CIA headquarters in June at an emerging technologies conference for the US intelligence community.\u201d\n\nAs he said at the time, this was a good opportunity to discuss the advantages of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, which he believed would align with the government\u2019s goals:\n\n\u201cI think the goals of this project are to create a better currency, create a more competitive and efficient international payment system, and give people more direct control over their finances. And I don\u2019t think any of those goals are incompatible with the goals of government.\u201d\n\nWith a \u201cfull disclosure,\u201d Andresen revealed he would receive \u201ca one-time fee of $3,000 to cover expenses and pay me for my time,\u201d adding that he was \u201conly very slightly worried that talking about Bitcoin at the CIA will increase the chances they\u2019ll try to do something we don\u2019t want them to do.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, he also voiced his opinion that \u201caccepting their invitation and being open about exactly what Bitcoin is will make it less likely they\u2019ll see it as a threat.\u201d\n\nSatoshi truly gone?\n\nSince 2011, Satoshi has not made any statements or comments in public unless you believe Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist that claims to be him and who has recently accused Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) of copyright infringement over putting Bitcoin white paper in all devices featuring macOS Catalina or later (now removed).\n\nInterestingly, Andresen lost his commit access to Bitcoin Core on GitHub in May 2016 after he publicly backed Wright\u2019s claims that he was Satoshi (though without substantial evidence other than certain \u2018people\u2019 who could prove it). However, he later expressed regret over his involvement in the \u2018who was Satoshi\u2019 game, saying he made \u201ca mistake to trust Craig Wright\u201d in a footnote to his original claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Satoshi\u2019s brainchild, Bitcoin, is changing hands at the price of $28,785, down 3.51% on the day, as well as declining 0.17% across the previous seven days but still holding on to the 5.89% gains accumulated over the past month, as per data retrieved on April 27."
