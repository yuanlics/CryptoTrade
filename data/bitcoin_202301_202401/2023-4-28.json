        "title": "If U.S. defaults on debt Bitcoin could rise nearly 70%, says Standard Chartered analyst - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin bulls have had a good year so far. If the U.S. defaults on its debt, it could get even better, at least in terms of their Bitcoin investment.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered\u2019s head of digital assets research. He told Insider this week that a U.S. default\u2014which he called a \u201clow-probability, high-impact event\u201d\u2014could cause Bitcoin to jump by about $20,000, an increase of nearly 70% from current levels.\n\nBitcoin started the year at well below $17,000 but is now hovering near $30,000. That\u2019s still well off its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, and some investors who bought Bitcoin around then are no doubt still licking their wounds.\n\nBitcoin, Kendrick predicted, would fare well even if overall cryptocurrencies, which trade more like stocks, did not. \u201cSo actually, the optimal trade would probably be long Bitcoin, short Ethereum. That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this,\u201d Kendrick told Insider.\n\nOn Monday, Kendrick said in a note that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024 and the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d was over. He added that Bitcoin has benefited from its status as a \u201cbranded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value and a means of remittance.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price shot up earlier this year after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed and fears of a banking crisis mounted.\n\nMeanwhile the debt ceiling crisis has intensified. On Wednesday, House Republicans passed legislation (barely) that would raise the government\u2019s debt ceiling in exchange for spending restrictions. In the weeks ahead, they\u2019ll try to reach a compromise with President Joe Biden that would allow the nation\u2019s debt to be lifted.\n\nIf the U.S. did default on its debt this summer, the consequences would be severe for America and the world. Last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned lawmakers that \u201ca default on our debt would trigger an economic and financial catastrophe.\u201d\n\nFew think it will come to that.\n\nBut even without a U.S. default, many Bitcoin bulls see good things ahead. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said in February that in five years Bitcoin will hit \u201croughly $670,000, something like that, and then by 2030, as we see more use cases and more of these insurance policies taken out against fiscal and policy regimes that are not healthy, we think it could pass $1 million.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has plenty of critics and doubters, of course. Mark Mobius, the billionaire cofounder of Mobius Capital Partners, predicted in December that Bitcoin would fall to $10,000 at some point this year. He has said of Bitcoin, \u201cIt\u2019s not an investment, it\u2019s a religion.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett reiterated his long-running skepticism. \u201cSomething like Bitcoin, it is a gambling token, and it doesn\u2019t have any intrinsic value,\u201d he told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t stop people from wanting to play the roulette wheel.\u201d"

That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this,\" Kendrick said.\n\nIf Congress fails to lift the $31.4 trillion federal debt limit, a default could come sometime in the summer \u2014 an event that could cause seismic ruptures global markets. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned a default would be catastrophic for the US economy, sparking mass unemployment, payment failures, and higher rates \"into perpetuity.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith House Republicans and the White House still far from a deal to raise the debt ceiling, yields on three-month Treasurys recently jumped to a 22-year high, as they would mature around a potential default date.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin is still recovering from a massive sell-off that began in late 2021 and continued through much of 2022 as the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive tightening cycle.\n\nBut bitcoin has rallied nearly 80% so far in 2023 and recently neared $30,000 as First Republic Bank's woes reignited fears over the financial sector.\n\nFor his part, Kendrick is already bullish on bitcoin, saying in a note on Monday that it could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024 due to bank turmoil, bitcoin halving, and the expected end of Fed rate hikes, among other things, though it didn't mention the risk of a US default.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer,\" he wrote."

        "content": "Francesco Carta Fotografo | Moment | Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency like bitcoin , new investors are often motivated by friends to take the plunge, according to a new study. But that might hold traps for the unwary, experts warn. \"I don't imagine friends are talking about when they lost money,\" said Lee Baker, a certified financial planner and founder of Apex Financial Services in Atlanta. \"The sexy sells,\" added Baker, a member of CNBC's Advisor Council. \"The upside sells. \"But folks don't talk about the downside,\" he added.\n\nNearly a third \u2014 31% \u2014 of new cryptocurrency investors in 2022 used a friend's suggestion as their primary reason for buying in, according to a recent joint study published by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Investor Education Foundation and NORC at the University of Chicago. Friends' recommendations were the No. 1 motivating factor for new crypto buyers. That share compares with 8% of new investors in more traditional assets like stocks and bonds. The disparity indicates there is \"a social element to cryptocurrency investing not evident in equities or bond investing,\" according to the study. This isn't to say a friend's recommendation is necessarily a poor reason to buy into the digital assets.\n\nwatch now\n\nBut it can be a \"double-edged sword,\" said Gary Mottola, research director at the FINRA Investor Education Foundation and a co-author of the report. On one hand, crypto can be an on-ramp to more traditional investing \u2014 which is generally a good outcome, Mottola said. There's some evidence of this happening: 36% of new crypto investors said their purchase made them more interested in investing in the stock market, the study found. However, \"the friends recommending [crypto], the sources of information on social media, may not be reliable,\" Mottola said.\n\nTrust but verify\n\nThe fear of missing out can be a powerful driver of investment decisions. Bitcoin and other crypto assets rallied through 2021, a record year for the digital assets. Bitcoin jumped from roughly $10,000 in the summer of 2020 to a peak above $68,000 by November 2021. But the tide turned quickly during a so-called \"crypto winter,\" when investors lost more than $2 trillion in the year following the market peak.\n\nThe sexy sells. The upside sells. But folks don't talk about the downside. Lee Baker CFP and founder of Apex Financial Services\n\nCelebrities, like actress Lindsay Lohan and the rapper Soulja Boy, were recently fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for undisclosed endorsements of various cryptocurrencies. \"Unless they're some legitimately knowledgeable financial person, trust but verify,\" Baker said of information you may hear from friends or from \"pseudo experts\" on social media. One of the dangers of following a friend's advice: Investors may not understand the risks and volatility associated with crypto (or other investments), or how it fits within a broader, well-diversified investment portfolio, he said."

        "content": "Venmo soon will allow users to transfer their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash to outside wallets\u2014as well as to other users of the popular payment app.\n\nThe feature will roll out starting in May, according to a statement from PayPal, which acquired Venmo in 2013. Users can also transfer crypto to their wallets at PayPal, which released a similar ability in 2022.\n\nCrypto transfers on Venmo will be irreversible, just like crypto transactions more broadly\u2014a function of cryptocurrency\u2019s use of blockchains, or immutable public ledgers. To roll out the transfer system, PayPal is partnering with Paxos, a crypto firm that specializes in stablecoins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to connect Venmo\u2019s customers to the community, other wallets and exchanges, and we intend to continue to roll out additional crypto products and services in the year ahead,\u201d PayPal said in its statement.\n\nThe announcement from PayPal is one of the first drips of crypto updates from the payments giant since February, when it was reported that the publicly traded company was pausing work on its own stablecoin after reports that Paxos, its partner in the effort, was under investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services, a key player among U.S. cryptocurrency regulators.\n\nAt the time, a spokesperson for PayPal told Fortune that the company was \u201cexploring a stablecoin\u201d and that if and when the payments giant moves forward, it will \u201cwork closely with relevant regulators.\u201d\n\nBefore the onset of Crypto Winter and the recent regulatory crackdown on the industry, PayPal was one of the more public crypto boosters among legacy fintech firms.\n\nIn October 2020, the company announced that U.S. users of PayPal would be able to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. One year later, the payments giant expanded the feature to Venmo customers.\n\nAmid the crypto bull market of 2021, PayPal continued to build out crypto offerings. It let users pay merchants with cryptocurrency, partnered with Coinbase to allow those with PayPal-linked debit cards and bank accounts to buy tokens on the exchange, and expanded its crypto service beyond the U.S. to other countries, including the U.K.\n\nAfter the collapse of several prominent crypto firms in 2022, PayPal noticeably rolled back its public rhetoric on cryptocurrencies. In February, longtime CEO Dan Schulman announced his intention to step down at the end of 2023.\n\nUpdate, April 28, 2023: This article has been updated to show that Paxos is partnering with PayPal to enable crypto transfers on Venmo."

The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value rose 1.2% over the last 24 hours to $29,307.

        "title": "Better Buy: Ethereum or Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite a recent pullback in the crypto market, both Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) continue to be two of the best-performing cryptos. Bitcoin is up about 80% for the year, while Ethereum is up about 60%. On the surface, it would appear that Bitcoin is clearly the superior investment in 2023.\n\nHowever, two market indicators paint a different picture of what's happening in the crypto market right now. Here's a closer look at how Ethereum stacks up with Bitcoin on a relative basis.\n\nBitcoin's correlation with Ethereum\n\nCorrelations are incredibly important in the crypto markets. For example, any time the correlation of Bitcoin with gold tightens, it usually signals that investors are about to pile into Bitcoin as a safe-haven investment. Investors also use the correlation of Bitcoin with broad market indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100 to gauge how the market currently views crypto as a risky asset. The tighter the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq, the thinking goes, the more that investors are viewing Bitcoin as just a slightly riskier tech stock.\n\nBut there's another correlation that many investors are not talking about, and that's the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum. The conventional wisdom is that the correlation between the two is very close to 1.0, so it's not really worth tracking. However, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) made waves earlier this month when it published a report showing how the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum appears to be declining, from a level of 0.95 in mid-March to a level of 0.82 in mid-April. That might not seem like a big deal, but it is for institutional investors. It directly impacts risk management and sophisticated hedging techniques.\n\nThere are a number of different factors that might be responsible for this shift, including Ethereum's recent tech upgrade in March. If this trend persists, it could signal that Ethereum is finally uncoupling from Bitcoin and going its own way. That would be a net positive for Ethereum because it would fundamentally challenge the simplistic \"Bitcoin is gold, Ethereum is silver\" investment narrative.\n\nThe Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair\n\nSince both Bitcoin and Ethereum are digital currencies, it makes sense to evaluate them from the perspective of a foreign exchange trader. One way of doing this is by tracking the performance of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair over time. By doing so, you can immediately see when Ethereum is \"strengthening\" against Bitcoin and when it is \"weakening\" against Bitcoin. In much the same way, a foreign exchange trader could see when the U.S. dollar is strengthening or weakening against the Euro (or some other currency).\n\nData by Trading View\n\nAs can be seen from the chart above, the current value of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair is approximately 0.066. This is derived from dividing the current price of Ethereum ($1,915) by the current price of Bitcoin ($28,964). The value of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair has traded, by and large, in a relatively narrow range of 0.06 to 0.08 since mid-2021. From a historical perspective, this value is actually quite high. In the period from 2019 to 2021, for example, the value typically ranged from 0.02 to 0.03. The big breakout came during the last crypto bull market rally when the number of possible use cases for Ethereum exploded. On the graph, it's possible to see a huge spike right around March 2021.\n\nPutting all this together, it's possible to create an investment thesis around Ethereum and Bitcoin. Ever since 2021, Ethereum seems to be gaining in value on a relative basis vs. Bitcoin. Another way to think about this is that as Ethereum continues to introduce new technological upgrades and expand its ecosystem, it is \"strengthening\" against Bitcoin and becoming a better investment. If you think about the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem as an economy, then this becomes intuitively clear. In the same way, one would expect the U.S. dollar to strengthen if the U.S. economy strengthens.\n\nDoes the data favor Ethereum?\n\nOverall, a case can be made that Ethereum is not just a better investment than Bitcoin right now, but that it's also becoming a better investment over time. Ethereum clearly has a more diversified blockchain ecosystem than Bitcoin and offers a whole range of products and offerings -- such as NFTs, blockchain gaming, metaverse worlds, and decentralized finance (DeFi) -- that Bitcoin simply can't match. Bitcoin is, first and foremost, a method of payment.\n\nThus, if you're a Bitcoin maximalist, you might want to take a closer look at the changing relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Right now, it looks like Ethereum after The Merge is stronger, better, and more diversified than it has ever been, and investors are starting to recognize this. At some point, say some crypto investors, Ethereum could eventually \"flip\" Bitcoin and become the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world."

        "content": "How Jack Dorsey\u2019s Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is fighting for the future of open source software It's not just the Bitcoin community that should be concerned\n\nA crypto wallet theft lawsuit brought about by a man who claims to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto could jeopardize the future of open source software development.\n\nThat\u2019s according to the Jack Dorsey-backed Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, which is taking on a case to defend 11 Bitcoin developers named in a lawsuit filed by Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who emerged into the spotlight back in 2016 with a hotly disputed claim of being Bitcoin\u2019s founding father.\n\nThe crux of the case in question dates back to 2021 when Wright, through a Seychelles-based firm called Tulip Trading, launched a so-called \u201cletter before action\u201d against 16 Bitcoin software developers, in an attempt to regain access to \u00a34 billion ($5 billion) worth of Bitcoin he claims to own. Wright said that he lost access to private keys for 111,000 Bitcoins after his home network was hacked the previous year, and that it was the responsibility of key Bitcoin Core (the main version of the Bitcoin protocol software) developers to remedy illegitimate crypto transactions.\n\nAlthough the case was initially dismissed last year before it made it to court, a U.K. appeals court reversed that decision back in March, allowing the case to proceed with a trial expected some time in 2024. In his findings, Lord Justice Birss pointed to academic literature that questions whether public blockchains really are decentralized.\n\n\u201cIf the decentralized governance of Bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment there is much to be said for the submission that bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSo on Wednesday this week, 11 Bitcoin developers filed their defense with support from the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, a not-for-profit set up in 2021 by Twitter and Block (formerly Square) co-founder Jack Dorsey, Block\u2019s head of litigation Martin White and Chaincode Labs co-founder Alex Morcos. The fund now also includes chief legal officer Jess Jonas, who joined in January.\n\n\u201cMulti-front litigation\u201d\n\nThe fund\u2019s founders initially penned an open letter to Bitcoin developers last year to explain their raison d\u2019\u00eatre. They pointed to the \u201cmulti-front litigation\u201d that the Bitcoin community faces, including Craig Wright\u2019s efforts which they confirmed at the time it would be leading the defense for. While they noted that the main purpose of the fund was to defend developers \u201cfrom lawsuits regarding their activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d they also noted that the ramifications extended far deeper into the broader open source realm.\n\n\u201cLitigation and continued threats are having their intended effect \u2014 individual defendants have chosen to capitulate in the absence of legal support,\u201d the trio wrote. \u201cOpen source developers, who are often independent, are especially susceptible to legal pressure. In response, we propose a coordinated and formalized response to help defend developers.\u201d\n\nA familiar story\n\nIn truth, the issue of the legal system interfering with open source software development has become a hot topic of late. In a letter to EU authorities last week, more than a dozen open source industry bodies said that the newly proposed Cyber Resilience Act, which seeks to codify cybersecurity practices for digital products sold in Europe, may have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on software development, as open source developers could be held personally liable for security slip-ups that happen in a downstream product. In other words, if the Act is to pass in its current form, developers might be less inclined to contribute to open source projects for fear of legal wrangles.\n\nElsewhere, some argue that the EU\u2019s upcoming AI Act, which seeks to govern AI applications based on perceived risks, could create burdensome legal liability for open source developers working on general purpose AI systems (GPAI), and give greater power to well-financed big tech companies.\n\nWhile the latest episode to emerge around Bitcoin is somewhat different, it gives rise to similar issues. The overarching story may well be about who does or doesn\u2019t get to control Bitcoin, and whether the project\u2019s core developer base should be forced to create some sort of \u201cback door\u201d to serve third-party access to private keys. But bubbling under the surface is something that\u2019s fundamental to the future of software, and whether open source developers should have a fiduciary duty to their users.\n\n\u201cWe believe that these lawsuits are frivolous, but we still have to oppose them vigorously,\u201d Jonas said in a statement.\n\nLegal responsibility\n\nPivotal to the defendants\u2019 case is the simple fact that Bitcoin was released under an open source MIT License, which bestows little in the way of any legal responsibility on those maintaining the software. The MIT License explicitly states:\n\nIn no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nBut if, for whatever reason, a court was to rule on the side of Tulip Trading, this could effectively destroy one of the core tenets of the MIT License that underpins countless open source projects today, setting a dangerous precedent that compels open source developers \u2014 many of whom work in their own time on their own dime \u2014 to serve the end-user of that software, no matter what their demands.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund fights not just for Bitcoin but for the right of open-source developers to create and freely share their code with the world for the greater good,\u201d Morcos said in a separate statement. \u201cThe Tulip Trading case threatens not only the MIT License but also the very notion of freedom of speech. Our collective mission is to safeguard innovation by shielding developers from legal intimidation.\u201d\n\nWhile there are 16 defendants in total, the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is only representing 11 developers who worked on Bitcoin Core. There is a 12th Bitcoin Core defendant who has not sought help from the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, plus a further four defendants that have worked on various Bitcoin forks who are arranging their own counsel.\n\nSeparately, Wright has initiated a secondary case against other Bitcoin developer entities, with Wright claiming ownership of Bitcoin copyright and database rights on the basis that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. This case was thrown out back in February, but the lawsuit quickly reemerged in a revised form with the defendants filing their defense last month. The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is supporting two Bitcoin Core developers named in that lawsuit too.\n\n\u201cThe outcomes of these cases are important for everyone, even those who may not be interested in Bitcoin, because these lawsuits could have serious detrimental effects on open-source development writ large, which will negatively impact our lives in ways we may not even realize until it\u2019s too late,\u201d Dorsey added in a statement."

        "title": "What Pullback? Bitcoin Can Still Hit $100,000 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Year to date, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is up 78%, and that's after a minor pullback that saw it lose nearly 10% of its value after briefly touching the $30,000 level for the first time in nearly 10 months. At the same time, Bitcoin continues to outperform just about every other major cryptocurrency.\n\nBut just how much higher can Bitcoin go? In mid-April, Standard Chartered Bank issued a new price target of $100,000 for Bitcoin for year-end 2024. At current prices, that would suggest a monster rally that sees Bitcoin more than triple in value in less than 20 months. So let's dive into some of the assumptions used to create that $100,000 price target.\n\nThe case for Bitcoin at $100,000\n\nA big reason Bitcoin might explode in value has to do with the current macroeconomic environment. According to Standard Chartered Bank, the \"crypto winter\" is officially over now, and people can go back to investing in crypto. Moreover, if you buy into the assumption that the Federal Reserve has finished tightening and will now leave interest rates alone or even cut them before too long, then that is obviously going to be a huge positive for the entire crypto market. Risk assets such as Bitcoin tend to flourish when rates are low or declining.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin is regaining its status as a \"safe haven\" asset that people put their money into when things look dicey in the broader economy. After the first stage of the banking crisis involving Silicon Valley Bank, some people rushed to take their money out of traditional banks and put it into Bitcoin, which they perceived as being a superior store of value. The same thing seems to be happening now with First Republic Bank (FRCB), with Bitcoin suddenly increasing in value after a brief pullback.\n\nBut can Bitcoin triple in value?\n\nOK, that all sounds great, but is it really enough to propel Bitcoin to $100,000? Keep in mind that the all-time high for Bitcoin is $68,789.63. So not only is Bitcoin going to face a tremendous amount of resistance fighting through the $40,000 level, the $50,000 level, and the $60,000 level, but it's also going to face an epic battle hitting a new all-time high at the $70,000 level. We've already seen a foreshadowing of this with Bitcoin at $30,000, when it immediately pulled back.\n\nI think the market is going to need a huge new catalyst to propel Bitcoin to stratospheric new heights. Standard Chartered Bank mentioned a few other factors that might help Bitcoin -- such as the increasing profitability of Bitcoin miners -- but all of these seem like minor, technical factors rather than big breakthrough catalysts.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nHowever, one factor that Standard Chartered Bank alluded to might just be big enough to propel Bitcoin to $100,000. This is an event known as the Bitcoin halving, and it takes place only once every four years. The next Bitcoin halving takes place in 2024 and is already being talked up in crypto circles as a huge opportunity for Bitcoin investors.\n\nIn a halving event, the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin falls by half. Right now, miners get 6.25 Bitcoins every time they add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, in April 2024, that reward will fall to 3.125 Bitcoins. That might not sound like a big deal, but it actually has huge implications for how Bitcoin trades. After each halving, Bitcoin becomes more scarce and more deflationary. Both of these factors, theoretically, should boost its value.\n\nAnd, indeed, in past halving cycles, the results have been dramatic. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has modeled past Bitcoin halving cycles and found that Bitcoin tends to rise in value in the 477 days prior to the halving and then explode in value afterward. As a result, back in November, Pantera thought Bitcoin could hit $36,000 by early 2024 and then skyrocket to $149,000.\n\nCaveats\n\nJust remember that past performance is no guarantee of future performance. And the impact of each Bitcoin halving cycle appears to be diminishing, so it might not be realistic to expect the same types of gains that we saw in 2012, 2016, or 2020. And, finally, it's worth noting that Standard Chartered Bank actually predicted in December that Bitcoin might crash to the $5,000 level in 2023, so it's safe to say that nobody really knows what Bitcoin will do this year.\n\nBut if you're looking for a reason why Bitcoin might hit the $100,000 mark in 2024, I think it has to be the next Bitcoin halving cycle. Fed easing is going to make it more likely that Bitcoin gets initial lift-off. A better overall macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. economy could reduce friction enough for Bitcoin to hit escape velocity. But for Bitcoin to skyrocket to the moon, it is going to need the fuel provided by the halving. As we near the midway point of 2023, look for discussion of this factor to dominate any future predictions of Bitcoin price performance in 2024."

The sword turned out to be not a real sword but a virtual one, which made Draper think about virtual stores of value versus traditional money. He said:\n\n\u201cSo people are buying virtual goods with fiat currency? And then I thought, \u2018Well, maybe there will be fiat currency to buy fiat goods.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter Bitcoin came along in 2009, Draper was already looking for something like BTC cryptocurrency, and he started accumulating BTC early. \u201cIt was the universal currency, it was the currency for our entire earth,\u201d he said.\n\nEven after losing 40,000 Bitcoin to the collapsed exchange Mt. Gox back in 2011, Draper didn\u2019t lose faith in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s cryptocurrency. He continued buying Bitcoin, bagging 30,000 BTC from a state auction of BTC seized from Silk Road in 2014.\n\nRelated: Tim Draper recommends founders hold \u2019at least\u2019 two payrolls \u2018worth of cash\u2019 in crypto\n\nDraper\u2019s passion for cryptocurrency was naturally passed on to his sons, Adam and Billy Draper. A fourth-generation venture capitalist, Adam Draper in 2012 founded Boost VC, an early stage venture capital firm focused on crypto. The company raised $90 million for its third round in September 2022. Adam\u2019s brother, Billy, has also been vocal about the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAccording to Tim, both his sons became somehow involved in the crypto industry after he became a Bitcoin bull.\n\nTim, Billy, Bill, Adam and Eleanor Draper. Source: Draper Cygnus\n\n\u201cMy son was very enthusiastic about me doing it. Both sons actually were about to work with me and the other one started a Boost accelerator and he decided that after I bought that Bitcoin he would create an accelerator just focused on Bitcoin,\u201d Draper said.\n\nOn the other hand, Tim\u2019s father, Bill Draper, has remained skeptical about crypto no matter what. \u201cMy father was not enthusiastic about it at all,\u201d Tim said, adding his father has always advised him to stick with the U.S. dollar.\n\nFollow the full story: How Tim Draper made a fortune investing in Bitcoin | Crypto Stories Ep. 23"

        "title": "Brother of man who ran Helix cryptocurrency mixer jailed for stealing 712 bitcoin - The Record from Recorded Future News",
        "content": "Gary Harmon, the brother of the man jailed for operating the Helix cryptocurrency mixer, was himself on Thursday jailed for stealing bitcoin his brother\u2019s operation had generated while it was subject to forfeiture.\n\nHarmon, 31, from Cleveland, Ohio, has been sentenced to four years and three months in prison for using the seed recovery words to recreate his brother\u2019s offline cryptocurrency wallet while it was in the possession of the FBI.\n\nLarry Harmon, Gary\u2019s brother, ran the Helix mixer from 2014 to 2017. He had partnered with various dark web markets \u2014 including AlphaBay, Cloud 9, and Evolution \u2014 to provide tumbling services to their customers.\n\nTumbling or mixing services generally charge a fee to pool together large amounts of funds from various owners, then \"mix\" the funds together and distribute them back out to destination addresses, which makes it difficult to trace digital coins to their original owners.\n\nProsecutors said over the course of its operations Helix moved over 350,000 bitcoins, amounting to more than $300 million at the time of the transactions.\n\nFollowing Larry Harmon\u2019s arrest in February 2020, law enforcement seized a range of assets from him including a Trezor Model One hardware wallet, which was found magnetically attached to the underside of a table at one of his properties.\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency stored on this device was subject to forfeiture in the criminal case, due to \u201cadditional security features\u201d the FBI was initially unable to recover the digital assets.\n\nTo physically access the hardware, investigators would have needed to plug it into a computer and enter a passcode, but Trezor devices also allow users to create \u201chidden wallets\u201d that are protected by an additional passphrase, without which they are not only inaccessible but invisible on the storage system.\n\nAccording to court documents, the FBI only learned of these hidden wallets after recovering a spreadsheet from Larry Harmon\u2019s Google Drive account that stated he had more than $56 million in cryptocurrency assets in hidden wallets.\n\nWhile the FBI was attempting to break into the storage device, Gary Harmon \u2014 who was not at that point under arrest \u2014 effectively recreated the device\u2019s bitcoin wallets using the recovery seed words, including the 16 hidden wallets.\n\nGary Harmon then transferred more than 712 digital coins \u2014 valued at $4.8 million at the time, and over $20 million today \u2014 into new wallets. These transfers were observed by law enforcement\u2019s blockchain monitoring specialists.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, whoever was behind the transfers then \u201cfurther laundered the proceeds through two online bitcoin mixer services before using the laundered bitcoins to finance large purchases and other expenditures.\u201d\n\nThe FBI conducted a voluntary interview with Harmon at this stage, and he denied any knowledge of the transactions.\n\nHowever, despite being unemployed and living what court documents described as \u201ca modest lifestyle\u201d prior to the removal of the bitcoins, shortly afterward Harmon \u201cbegan making thousands of dollars in unexplained cash deposits into his bank accounts.\u201d\n\nThese purchases included a 2018 Audi S5 luxury automobile; flights by TapJets, a private charter jet company that accepts bitcoin as payment; and, on February 12, 2021, more than 16 million dogecoins.\n\nHarmon was arrested on July 28, 2021, at his \"luxury condominium unit\" in Cleveland. He pleaded guilty in January 2023 to wire fraud and obstruction of justice and agreed to forfeit more than 647.41 in bitcoin, 2.14 ethereum, and 17,404,400.64 dogecoin.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice stated that \u201cdue to the increase in market prices, the total value of these forfeitable properties exceeds $12 million.\u201d"

        "content": "Gary Harmon admitted to stealing the money after his brother, Larry, was caught running a massive crypto laundering scheme.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A Cleveland man will spend the next four years and three months in federal prison for his role in a multi-million-dollar cryptocurrency scheme.\n\nGary Harmon received his sentence Friday in Washington, D.C.'s U.S. District Court. The 31-year-old previously pleaded guilty to wire fraud and obstruction of justice after stealing more than 712 bitcoin, valued at roughly $4.8 million.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, the case has its roots in an earlier plot perpetrated by Harmon's older brother, Akron native Larry Harmon. Larry ran a crypto money laundering service known as Helix, and prosecutors say he used the dark web to pilfer more than 350,000 bitcoin that was worth upwards of $300 million at the time.\n\nLarry Harmon was arrested in February 2020 and had his assets seized, but during the proceedings, Gary Harmon purportedly used his brothers credentials to illegally transfer hundreds of bitcoin to his own pockets and hide the money from possible forfeiture. He then sent the currency through multiple \"mixer\" services and used the proceeds \"to finance large purchases and other expenditures.\"\n\nGary Harmon was eventually arrested, and besides the bitcoin authorities also confiscated about 2 Ethereum and more than 17 million in Dogecoin. Per the DOJ, the total value of these crypto stashes exceeds $20 million.\n\nBack in August of 2021, Larry Harmon pleaded guilty to orchestrating the Helix plot. He has not yet been sentenced, but faces up to 20 years behind bars."

        "content": "If Bitcoin (BTC) were a country, it might be one of the biggest in the world. That\u2019s according to Jeff Booth, general partner at Bitcoin venture fund Ego Death Capital and author of The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation is the Key to an Abundant Future. Cointelegraph spoke to Booth to better understand and visualize the Bitcoin movement\u2019s state in 2023.\n\nBooth sat down to enjoy a pint and a chat about Bitcoin in Bedford, a small suburban town that has attracted Bitcoin advocates and key opinion leaders from all over the world. Booth commented on the emergence and resilience of the Bitcoin community and how people can get involved personally in the decade ahead.\n\nJeff Booth (right) speaks to Cointelegraph\u2019s Joe Hall\n\nBooth suggested that the Bitcoin community could usher in a fundamental change to the world if its members dedicated more of their time to the cause. He said that change could be spurred \u201cif all of those people just said, I\u2019m moving and spending more of my time in this to massively step-change the adoption rate.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin hodlers \u2014 those that hold onto their Bitcoin in the hopes of the currency reaching mass adoption \u2014 are the backbone of Bitcoin. However, if more of those people could actively use their Bitcoin, the movement could pick up steam and reach its goal faster, Booth argues:\n\n\u201cIt would be staggering if the people that were just holding as a hedge decided, I\u2019m going to advance, I\u2019m going to spend more time in the world I want to see and move their time and attention there. The world would move there. I saw it in myself.\u201d\n\nFrom simple steps like asking if merchants accept Bitcoin to businesses choosing to accept Bitcoin as a preferred means of exchange, there are certain moves that people can make to further the cause. In-person Bitcoin meetups also contribute. Booth commented on the impact of the Bitcoin-themed Real Bedford football team as a way to introduce Bitcoin to a wider audience:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s [Peter McCormack] using this vehicle to advance a whole bunch of other stuff, which is really cool.\u201c\n\nPeter McCormack told Cointelegraph in a separate interview that the Bitcoin movement in 2023 covers far more than the currency: \u201cIt\u2019s Nostr, it\u2019s Bitcoin, it\u2019s mainstream media lies, it is poor governance and regulation.\u201d Nostr is a decentralized protocol championed by Bitcoin advocates. Nostr applications like Damus seek to compete with Twitter and other popular social media platforms.\n\nBooth shared that there are more and more ways to use and engage with Bitcoin since his \u201cinitiation\u201d into Bitcoin, sometimes referred to as taking the \u201corange pill.\u201d The Canadian observes that the payments network; the Lightning Network, and Fedimint; a solution for shared custody, present more ways for Bitcoin enthusiasts to get stuck in. Moreover, a lot of engagement and interaction with these Bitcoin subsets takes place online:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many friends that I\u2019ve actually never met, and I consider them close friends that over time you develop these relationships, these online relationships that you\u2019ve never met.\u201d\n\nBooth added, \u201cThere is something about meeting in person and spending that time going deeper doing this, and there\u2019s something about that that I don\u2019t think can be replaced online.\u201d Initiatives like McCormack\u2019s in Bedford help bridge that gap and encourage Bitcoiners to engage with the local community.\n\nRelated: What security? Bitcoin enthusiast cracks known 12-word seed phrase in minutes\n\nPlus, given that Bitcoiners are currently distributed across the globe, with communities popping up in Senegal, Guatemala and Vietnam, Booth sees potential for local network effects to develop.\n\n\u201cHow many Bitcoiners are actually just holding it and are waiting?\u201d he asked.\n\nIf the hodlers and those \u201cholding it [Bitcoin] as a hedge\u201d decided to spend more time in the world they want to see, and move both their time and attention there, then, as Booth concludes: \u201cThe world would move there.\u201c\n\nThis interview is part of an upcoming documentary about Bitcoin in Bedford shown on Cointelegraph\u2019s YouTube channel.

        "content": "Macro Markets, hosted by crypto analyst Marcel Pechman, airs every Friday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel and explains complex concepts in layperson\u2019s terms, focusing on the cause and effect of traditional financial events on day-to-day crypto activity.\n\nThe risks of a United States debt default are the first topic of this week\u2019s show, which comes from none other than Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen warned of potential mass unemployment, payment failures and broad economic weakness if the U.S. failed to pay its debts. This issue emerges every couple of years, creating some tension within Congress, but at some point, they agree to raise the debt limit. So, no harm done, right?\n\nThat\u2019s partially true because if the government doesn\u2019t have a majority, which happens to be the case, the opposition has the upper hand to bargain their demands. In this case, Republicans want President Joe Biden to drop $4.5 trillion in unsound projects, such as letting go of some of the student debt or hiring thousands of Internal Revenue Service employees.\n\nPechman explains how the event, whatever the outcome, is bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) and discusses the odds of a government debt default and how the debt ceiling increase drives liquidity to the markets, favoring scarce assets.\n\nThe next segment of Macro Markets focuses on Tesla, the EV automaker controlled by Elon Musk. Firstly, he\u2019ll go over its importance for Bitcoin holders and the cryptocurrency sector then proceed to summarize the company\u2019s financial conditions and why the 9,200 BTC held by Tesla doesn\u2019t pose a risk for Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe show concludes by examining how short-selling works. Unlike futures contracts, to sell a stock on margin, one needs to borrow it from a holder. Typically, those rates are negligent, maybe between 0.3% and 3% per year. However, when there\u2019s excessive betting against the stock price and the demand for shorts increases, this rate can go as high as 50% per year or become unavailable.\n\nIn the semi-failed First Republic Bank\u2019s case, which saw net redemptions of $100 billion in the previous quarter, short sellers are having trouble borrowing the stock, but Pechman explains how that does not pose a problem to those interested in betting on the bank\u2019s stock price decline. According to Marcel, the bailout of First Republic Bank can further catapult Bitcoin above $30,000.\n\nIf you are looking for exclusive and valuable content provided by leading crypto analysts and experts, make sure to subscribe to the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

        "content": "While all eyes are on Bitcoin\u2019s creep toward $30,000 and Ether\u2019s double-digit year-to-date jump, another cryptocurrency has quietly surpassed the gains of both since the start of the year.\n\nSolana, or SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, has shot up 133% since trading at just $10 on Jan. 1, continuing to shrug off any reputational hit from being associated with Sam Bankman-Fried. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is up 78% and Ether is up just over 50% over the same period.\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s market capitalization sank to $5.3 billion the day after FTX declared bankruptcy, it has since recovered 72% to $9.1 billion. It was up 3% over 24 hours on Friday afternoon, trading at $22.86. Bitcoin and Ether were both down about 1%, at $29,300 and $1,800, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe number of successful transactions on the Solana blockchain rose to 713 million in March\u2014the most since October\u2014according to data tracker FlipSide. The total number of transactions is still down year over year largely due to a lagging bear market.\n\nThe Solana blockchain, which backs the Solana cryptocurrency, pitches itself as a faster and cheaper alternative to the Ethereum blockchain, still the most popular for decentralized apps such as NFT marketplaces and financial applications.\n\nBut Solana\u2019s pitch as an \u201cEthereum killer\u201d has hit some snags, including a number of recent outages and slowdowns. In February, a performance disruption resulted in issues with transactions and caused validators, who verify transactions on the blockchain, to restart the network to resolve the problem. Solana also faced a setback in the NFT space earlier this year when two of its most popular collections, y00ts and DeGods, left the blockchain.\n\nAustin Federa, head of strategy for the Solana Foundation, previously told Fortune he wasn\u2019t concerned about the projects leaving.\n\nJust a month after losing those collections, a new project, Mad Lads, is bringing some excitement back to Solana NFTs. The collection, created by the Web3 company Coral\u2014cofounded by Solana developer Armani Ferrante\u2014launched this week and has already become the most traded NFT with the highest sales volume over the past seven days, according to Crypto Slam.\n\nCompared with $11.4 million for Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, Mad Lads generated $17 million in sales over the last seven days, according to Crypto Slam. The Mad Lads trading frenzy also helped the Solana blockchain stay just above Polygon in number of transactions over the past week, according to Crypto Slam, even as Starbucks and other big companies flocked to the latter blockchain.\n\nMad Lads is one of the first of a new type of non-fungible token called executable NFTs, or xNFTs. While most NFTs are tied to centralized websites to provide the experiences they promise, xNFTs allow for built-in functionality. It could allow a game developer, for example, to mint an entire game as limited-edition xNFTs. For Mad Lads, the pictures act as a chat room for users that\u2019s rendered entirely within the NFT, thanks to Coral\u2019s new crypto wallet, Backpack, Federa wrote in a blog post.\n\nFedera said Mad Lads\u2019 launch is proof that Solana\u2019s more flexible NFT technology is a boon for entrepreneurs and creators.\n\n\u201cNFTs on Solana has always been a little bit different than other chains,\u201d Federa told Fortune. \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of relentless innovation and a drive to experiment.\u201d"

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nCircle launches cross-chain USDC transfer protocol\n\nCircle launched a cross-chain protocol that enables USDC transfers between the Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains. The protocol works by burning the selected amount of native USDC on the source chain, and minting an equivalent amount of new USDC on the intended destination chain. The protocol essentially makes USDC transfers between the two networks faster and more user-friendly, as prior to its launch, people had to use third-party bridges or a Circle partner to facilitate transfers between the two networks. Additional support for Solana and other blockchains will be added later in 2023.\n\nStablecoin payments: Visa shares plans for \u2018ambitious\u2019 crypto product\n\nCuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, announced a new cryptocurrency-related project, on April 24, focused on stablecoin payments. Details are sparse at this stage; however, Sheffiled shared a job listing relating to the project, with the description noting that the \u201cVisa Crypto Team is building the next generation of products to facilitate commerce in everyone\u2019s digital and mobile lives.\u201d The job listing is seeking candidates with a good understanding of layer-1 and layer-2 solutions, alongside experience with writing smart contracts using the programming language Solidity, among other things.\n\nKraken asks San Francisco court to intervene against IRS demands\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken has fought back against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over what it feels is an \u201cunjustified treasure hunt\u201d for user\u2019s trading info. According to court documents, the firm requested a federal court in San Francisco to intervene and ask the IRS to back off. The IRS issued a summons in February demanding additional information on Kraken users who traded $20,000 or more in any single year from 2016 to 2020.\n\nMeta disclosed in its Q1 earnings report that its metaverse unit, Reality Labs, posted a loss of around $4 billion during the quarter. In what has been a costly venture for the firm, the $4 billion loss adds to the $14 billion Reality Labs loss over the entirety of 2022. Still, Meta posted a profit totalling roughly $5.7 billion in Q1 overall, with the firm\u2019s work on artificial intelligence somewhat curbing the losses.

As it stands, Gensler thinks almost every crypto asset apart from BTC is a security, and has pushed hard to regulate the crypto sector from that viewpoint. However, in a snippet from one of his \u201cBlockchain and Money\u201d lectures from 2018 \u2014 while he was working as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 Gensler said, \u201cThree quarters of the market is non-securities, it\u2019s just a commodity, cash, crypto.\u201d He even suggested Ether was not a security, despite repeatedly suggesting otherwise over the past couple years.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $29,275, Ether (ETH) at $1,900 and XRP at $0.47.

        "title": "Bitcoin keeps wavering between a store of value and a high-risk asset. How investors square that with their traditional ... - CNBC",
        "content": "Investors aren't sure what to make of bitcoin right now. Since the beginning of the year, the cryptocurrency has behaved as both a risk asset and a hedge against uncertainty. That's been especially true since turmoil in the U.S. banking sector began in March and returned volatility to the market. Bitcoin has soared 77% this year. Volatility (and therefore uncertainty) is a key characteristic of cryptocurrencies \u2013 at least for now. Despite what looks and sounds like institutional adoption and mainstream advancement, it's still very early days for the industry, so getting comfortable with the unpredictability is step one to being a good investor in it, according to Tyrone Ross, president and founder of financial planning firm 401 Financial. \"If you make an investment into bitcoin, you understand that this is par for the course, it just is,\" he told CNBC. \"You can dollar cost average in and hold it. Traders who have used a lot of leverage and have gotten liquidated in shorts \u2013 those folks have a whole different set of issues than those that are really looking at it as an investment. These moves should not bother you if you are really an investor in bitcoin and understand it.\" \"Believe in the core reasons for which you put money in and hopefully there are some 'narratives' around that that you can hang on to when it gets really volatile like this,\" he added. Bitcoin spent much of 2022 being tied to stocks, with inflation data and Fed policy as its main price drivers. That correlation has been sliding since the beginning of this year, but bitcoin remains sensitive to the macro economy. Meanwhile, its correlation with gold spiked in early March when the banking crisis began. This week, just as crypto volatility had returned to pre-banking crisis lows , troubles at First Republic Bank reignited concerns about the health of U.S. banks and bitcoin rallied as much as 8% . Still, investors are holding their breath for the next policy decision by the Fed at its meeting next week \u2013 with many expecting a hard landing, and positioning for dollar debasement and interest rate cuts. Additionally, with so much liquidity having been drained from the market these past two months, investors aren't trusting any bitcoin rally to turn into the next great bull run. \"Because bitcoin takes on a lot of asset profiles \u2013 risk asset, store of value, VC-like nascent asset class \u2013 investing in it is actually really attractive,\" said Greg King, CEO of investment company Osprey Funds. \"Truly uncorrelated assets, with unpredictable behavior and a positive expected value, are rare jewels in terms of portfolio allocation.\" \"Being highly volatile means that even a small allocation of bitcoin to a portfolio is enough to make the investment noticeable,\" he added. A very early technology play Looking at the price path on short timeframes, bitcoin will and often does mimic high-risk assets. The volatility will go away though, as it has for other new technology advancements before it, according to Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian investment fund manager 3iQ. He pointed out that over the past 10 years, bitcoin has declined from 5x more volatile than the Nasdaq in 2015 to 3x in 2019, to just 1.8x at the end of last year. \"The qualities that make it an exponential grower bear out over periods of quarters and years,\" he said. \"It's declining its volatility profile at a greater rate relative to equities,\" he said. \"Mature assets don't have high adoption rates,\" he added. \"People already own all the equities they're going to own. We're not going to have another 20% of people buy equities because there aren't 20% of people around to buy equities \u2013 birth rates are down, portfolios are mature.\" Ross had a nuanced view, arguing that bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin over the past year For the past decade traders have tried to understand bitcoin's identity, sometimes with little patience for its newness and ability to morph from one thing to another. It was designed to be digital cash for those excluded from the formal financial system. New entrants to the market that came in the 2021 bull run were sold on the idea of a hedge against inflation. They've gotten used to it trading like a stock. \"Is it pristine collateral for some folks? Perhaps,\" Ross said. \"Is it a better currency for some folks? Yes. Is it an inflation hedge? It didn't seem like it was. Is it safety when First Republic Bank looks like it's on the brink of collapse? Sure. But it's a speculative asset that is highly volatile and benefits from a very liquid environment,\" he said. For Ross, it's also a technology bet. New crypto investors often overlook the Bitcoin technology, focusing instead on bitcoin the crypto asset. Ross is bullish on its ability to act as a financial system for those who can't access bank accounts. \"We have a venture capital investment essentially, with liquid pricing,\" Connors said. \"That's a combination we're not used to, so to have an understanding of it is job one. The second one is to size it appropriately so that you're not watching all the time.\" \"Volatility is a price you pay and, as people say, price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin \u2013 although that's a hard pill to swallow,\" Connors added."

        "content": "Influencer and ex-kick boxer Andrew Tate and his brother\u2019s Bitcoin BTC/USD holdings were reportedly seized by Romanian authorities in mid-February. Tate was incarcerated in Romania facing charges of human trafficking and rape after being arrested.\n\nMateea Petrescu, a spokesperson for Tate and his brother Tristan told Decrypt that, in addition to the arrests, hardware wallets containing a combined 21 Bitcoins, worth approximately $467,625, were confiscated.\n\nPetrescu said Andrew Tate\u2019s wallet contained five Bitcoin \u2014 currently valued at around $111,339 \u2014 while Tristan\u2019s wallet held 16 Bitcoin. Authorities in Romania also seized millions of dollars worth of luxury cars, homes, and watches belonging to Tate.\n\nIt should be noted that Tate had been outspoken about Bitcoin and its potential.\n\nIn a podcast late last year with Anthony Pompliano, Tate said \u201cIt\u2019s one of the simplest ways to take charge of your finances and move money quickly and securely. \u201cWith Bitcoin, you can actually control and own your money,\u201d he noted. \u201cThink about how hard it used to be to move large sums of cash around \u2013 no problem with Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nTate in the same podcast also revealed returns he\u2019s earned from his crypto investments: \u201c[I] turned $600,000 into $12 million,\u201d he said.\n\nAndrew Tate first came to prominence when he appeared on Big Brother in 2016, but was removed from the programe after a video surfaced online wherein he was seen attacking a woman with a belt. Though he claimed that the video had been edited. He has built up a massive presence on social media, with approximately 6.4 million followers on Twitter alone.\n\nTate has been in the news since then due to his controversial comments and espousal of traditional \u2018manly\u2019 values, which have rubbed many in the mainstream press and \u2018woke\u2019 anti-masculinity zealots the wrong way."

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nMost of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have appreciated in value over the last seven days, with Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and the Internet Computer Project (ICP) leading the rally.\n\nBitcoin is around 7.5% pricier than it was this time last weekend and trades for $29,295 as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, the world\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency slipped down to $27,500, but on Wednesday, it reclaimed $29,000 after another potential insolvency rocked the traditional finance world; shares in First Republic Bank fell 50% on Tuesday, a day after its latest quarterly report revealed a marked decline in deposits.\n\nFrom Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper onwards, crypto has been pitched to the world as an alternative to the banking system. So, when TradFi institutions are in trouble, investors often flock to crypto\u2014as happened last month when news of Credit Suisse\u2019s insolvency pumped Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThe market\u2019s second biggest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, only managed to add 2.7% to its value this week and currently trades for $1,906.\n\nThe biggest rallies among leading cryptocurrencies came from Solana, which grew 11% and is now worth $23.35, and ICP blew up 16.6% to change hands at $6.58.\n\nHolders of Cosmos Hub (ATOM) found their stashes increased this Saturday as the token rallied 8.5% over the week to trade at $11.68.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe glare from regulators\u2019 headlamps has been intensifying recently as U.S. agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) continue to bring enforcement actions against the industry instead of new guidelines.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, Democrat and California lower house lawmaker Matt Haney introduced Assembly Bill 1229, a legal framework for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that would change state legislation to enable DAOs to incorporate and pay taxes in California while providing better safeguards for Californians participating in the Web3 economy.\n\nThe bill already has support from crypto investment firm Andreessen Horowitz and the Crypto Council for Innovation.\n\nOn Tuesday, news broke on Twitter that Binance US had walked away from a deal to acquire the assets of crypto lender Voyager, one of the high-profile casualties stemming from Terra\u2019s collapse last May. In a statement to Decrypt, the exchange cited \u201cthe hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States\u201d as the main factor behind the decision to ax the deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, reports emerged that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had hired lawyers to defend himself against multiple legal threats filed against him and his exchange by the SEC, the CFTC, and the Department of Justice.\n\nThat day, crypto-friendly Texas Senator Ted Cruz launched a diatribe against the idea of an American central bank digital currency (CBDC) during the Bitcoin Policy Summit.\n\nCBDCs are currently being researched by governments worldwide, including those of the U.S. and the EU. A CBDC is a stablecoin pegged to the local currency, and advocates say they would facilitate online payments while taking advantage of blockchain features like instant settlement and smart contracts. However, critics fear the result would lead to an increase in centralized control over our money, which goes against crypto's very ethos.\n\nCruz argued that U.S. leaders would use a CBDC \u201cto destroy all value of Bitcoin, to destroy anonymity, to destroy decentralization.\u201d He added: \u201cThe same people that want to see a CBDC, they hate Bitcoin, and they hate cash. Let's be clear; they don't like cash for exactly the reason I like cash because it is not subjected to centralized control that is not subject to constant surveillance. And so I hope we see growing resistance to a CBDC.\u201d\n\nCBDC skepticism is prevalent in Republican circles. Last month Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Ohio Representative Warren Davidson echoed Cruz\u2019s sentiments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, at a Bloomberg event on Thursday, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) CEO Julia Leung announced the special administrative region will launch its crypto licensing regime next month.\n\nThe new rules promise to let retail investors trade significant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with fewer restrictions from June 1."

        "title": "Berenberg Analysts: Bitcoin 'Could Rally' Near Next Year's Halving Event - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) may finally leave crypto winter behind and outshine the market in the coming months, according to a research report by Berenberg.\n\nSuch a possibility could be due to \u201ca combination of circumstances, evolution, and timing,\u201d reported the Hamburg-based multinational investment bank.\n\nNotably, analysts write, Bitcoin is practically the only digital asset to be characterized as a commodity rather than a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the decentralized nature of its blockchain protocol, as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving that will see the rate at which new coins are produced and released into circulation cut in half, per the report author Mark Palmer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe halving cuts miner rewards in half. Currently, miners earn a reward of 6.25 Bitcoin; by next Spring, that figure will be 3.125.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin halving events have been associated with a significant increase in the price of the asset, and Berenberg sees the next one as no different. Moreover, the next halving could also \u201cserve as catalyst\u2026 by extension,\u201d for MicroStrategy shares, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin reserves at about 140,000 BTC.\n\n\u201cIf history is any guide, then we believe the price of Bitcoin could rally ahead of and following this much-anticipated halving, with MSTR\u2019s stock offering a leveraged means through which investors can take advantage of that event,\u201d reads the report.\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin rallied about 65% since the start of the year, MSTR is up almost 120% over the span.\n\nMicroStrategy stock closed the Thursday trading session at $318.64, with Berenberg covering MSTR with a buy rating and a $430 price target.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years, with the protocol specifying that there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. The halving is designed to gradually slow down the creation of new coins until the final one is mined in the year 2140.\n\nThe first Bitcoin halving took place in November 2012, when the mining reward was reduced from 50 BTC to 25 BTC per block. The second halving occurred in July 2016, reducing the reward to 12.5 BTC per block, and the third halving took place in May 2020, reducing the reward to 6.25 BTC per block.\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is set to occur at block 840,000, which is estimated to happen approximately in April 2024, with the mining reward to be reduced once again by half.\n\nThe halving has important implications for Bitcoin's supply and demand dynamics. Slowing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, makes the asset slightly more scarce.\n\nOn the flip side, the halving makes mining less profitable for miners, as they receive fewer Bitcoins for the same amount of work. This can lead to a decrease in the network's hashrate and increased competition among miners.\n\nWhat other factors may boost the price of Bitcoin?\n\nBerenberg also argues that Bitcoin\u2019s recent appreciation can be seen \u201cas an indication that more investors are recognizing it as a sensible alternative not only among crypto tokens, but also within a global financial context.\u201d\n\nThe banking crisis earlier this year, the report reads, has also had a \"lingering impact\" on traditional finance, even arguing that investors have lost trust in the Federal Reserve \"due to its perceived mishandling of the interest-rate cycle.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bank said that these macro factors have led to concerns about de-dollarization\u2014the process of reducing or eliminating the use of the U.S. dollar in international trade and financial transactions\u2014and could potentially highlight the value proposition of Bitcoin as an alternative currency.\n\nThis is also what MSTR stock could benefit from \u201cif investors increasingly turn to Bitcoin as an alternative currency,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cAs such, we believe Bitcoin has emerged as a safe haven relative to other crypto tokens, and this advantaged position could spur demand for it,\u201d reads the report."

        "content": "The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on April 27 that it has obtained a court judgment against a CEO involved in Bitcoin-related fraud.\n\nCEO was involved in Bitcoin MLM\n\nThe case in question concerns Cornelius Johannes Steynberg of South Africa, who was the founder and CEO of Mirror Trading International Proprietary Limited (MTI).\n\nSteynberg engaged in an international multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme in which he solicited Bitcoin investment from the public.\n\nSteynberg and his company promised investors the opportunity to participate in a commodity pool. Not only was that commodity pool unregistered, Steynberg and MTI falsely portrayed the pool\u2019s trading activity as bot-operated when in fact they traded off-exchange retail forex. The two pwraties ultimately misappropriated all of their investors\u2019 Bitcoin.\n\nSteynberg began his MLM scheme in May 2018 and solicited funds from more than 23,000 individuals in the U.S. and globally. He obtained nearly 30,000 BTC in total, an amount that was worth $1.7 billion when the scheme concluded in March 2021.\n\nSteynberg faces CFTC\u2019s largest civil fine ever\n\nThe CFTC said it will fine Steynberg $3.4 billion. Half of that amount will go toward providing restitution to victims, while the other half will go toward a civil penalty.\n\nThe above amount is the highest civil monetary penalty imposed by the CFTC, and case itself is the agency\u2019s largest fraud case involving Bitcoin to date.\n\nSteynberg is also enjoined (or barred) from registering with the CFTC, participating in CFTC-regulated markets, and engaging in activity that violates commodities rules. Steynberg has been held in Brazil on an INTERPOL arrest warrant since December 2021 and is still a fugitive from South African authorities, today\u2019s announcement says.\n\nThe CFTC previously charged Steynberg\u2019s company directly in 2022. The agency has also taken action against numerous other crypto-related groups and individuals in recent months, including a Mango Markets hacker and OokiDAO\u2019s founders.\n\nMost notably, the CFTC announced charges against the major cryptocurrency exchange Binance and a number of its executives in March."

        "title": "Bitcoin Emerges As the King Of Assets,10X Growth Over Gold During US Banking Crisis - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Despite the volatile price action of Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has outperformed every other asset, including gold. Although it is trading below its psychological milestone of $30,000 at $29,000, Bitcoin is expected to grow further in 2023, as it acts as a safe haven for investors amidst the US banking crisis.\n\nBitcoin Reigns Supreme As the Best-Performing Asset\n\nCapriole Investment, which provides research and analysis on cryptocurrencies, has reported that the current market cycle favors hard assets like gold, as indicated by the 200-week Gold-to-Stocks ratio. This classic indicator highlights when the market favors safe-haven assets like gold over riskier equity assets. Both gold and Bitcoin have generated some of their best returns during these phases.\n\nAs the market continues to favor hard assets, Bitcoin has emerged as the preferred safe haven for wealth amidst the US banking crisis and fiat currency weakness. During this period of high correlation, Bitcoin has outperformed gold by 10X in 2023, making it the best-performing asset of the year among major asset classes.\n\nThe strong positive correlation between Bitcoin and Gold has also increased significantly, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against economic uncertainty. With unsustainable tightening, banking crises, and de-dollarization looming, the market is turning to these safe-haven assets to protect their wealth.\n\nAccording to the report by Capriole Investment, the current Bitcoin rally in 2023 is believed to be organic and spot driven. The report highlights a key metric showing total futures Open Interest as a ratio of the total Bitcoin and USDT market cap.\n\nThis metric provides insight into the market\u2019s leverage and shows that the crypto market leverage peaked with the FTX fraud in November 2022. Since then, this ratio has been on a one-way downtrend, despite Bitcoin\u2019s price rallying over 80% from $16,000 to $30,000. This indicates that there has been little speculation in the market this year.\n\nThe report suggests that until this ratio spikes or Bitcoin dominance peaks, the foundations for sustainable price appreciation remain in place. This means that the current rally is driven by organic demand rather than speculation, which is a positive sign for the long-term growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFurthermore, the report suggests that the decrease in leverage indicates a healthy market less vulnerable to sudden price drops. This is because a high level of leverage can often lead to market instability, causing sharp price swings and potentially resulting in a market crash.\n\nBTC\u2019s $30-32K Dilemma\n\nAccording to the report, Bitcoin is trading within the largest technical resistance block on the chart since $20,000. This region, which ranges from $30,000 to $32,000, represents the bottom of the 2021 range and the breakdown point into the bear market that began in 2022.\n\nAdditionally, it is a major weekly order block level and Fibonacci extension level from the prior cycle. $30,000 is also a major round number level, representing a 50% increase from the 2017 cycle all-time-high of $20,000, and $32,000 marks a 100% appreciation in Bitcoin since the FTX Fraud bottom at $16,000.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience in recent months, it is important to note that past performance is not an indicator of future results. However, according to Capriole\u2019s report, if Bitcoin manages to close above $32,000 weekly, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see a new trend carry its price into the $40,000 mark.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin [BTC]: Interest in Ordinals rises, but is FUD on the way? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Interest in Bitcoin Ordinals continued to rise.\n\nFUD and Speculation around the U.S. government and Mt.GOX wallets impacted trader behavior.\n\nUpon their initial introduction, Bitcoin [BTC] inscriptions garnered considerable attention from the cryptocurrency community. This led to speculations that the hype would be short-lived and interest in ordinals would wane soon.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nOut of the Ordin(al)ry\n\nHowever, at press time, it appeared that inscriptions surpassed one million. This represented roughly 6% of the total activity on the Bitcoin network.\n\nConsequently, the fees associated with ordinals that are paid out to miners rose. This resulted in a decrease in the selling pressure on ordinals.\n\nDue to these factors, Bitcoin miners started seeing growth in terms of revenue generated over the last few days, according to blockchain.com\n\nSpeculations start to rise\n\nHowever, the FUD around Bitcoin could soon stunt this growth. Recently, there was speculation going around that large transactions were being made by the BTC wallets of the U.S. government and Mt.Gox trustees.\n\nFor context, Mt. Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world before it filed for bankruptcy in 2014. The exchange suffered a massive security breach resulting in the loss of 850,000 bitcoin, worth around $460 million at the time.\n\nThe court appointed Nobuaki Kobayashi as the trustee to oversee the fair and transparent distribution of the remaining assets and funds to the exchange\u2019s creditors.\n\nAdditionally, Kobayashi sold a significant amount of the remaining bitcoin over the years to pay back the creditors. He currently holds a substantial number of bitcoins which will be distributed to the claimants.\n\nMany stated that the FUD surrounding the government transactions has led to the recent decline in BTC prices.\n\nIt is to be noted that the U.S government was the largest holder of Bitcoin at press time. According to Glassnode\u2019s data, the U.S. government and the Mt.Gox trustee held 205,514 and 137,890 BTC, respectively.\n\nBased on our labels at @glassnode, neither the USG, nor Mt Gox are spending any coins from addresses we monitor. Stay safe out there folks. https://t.co/1B8gUVKjon pic.twitter.com/O5CZ0VtrYh \u2014 _Check\u0271ate ?\u26a1?\u2622\ufe0f?\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) April 26, 2023\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nThis FUD also affected trader behavior as well. As the expiry date for 105,000 Bitcoin options draws near, GreeksLive\u2019s data showed that these options have a Put Call Ratio of 0.85.\n\nFurthermore, this ratio suggested that there are more investors betting on a dip in Bitcoin\u2019s price. The options also have a max pain point of $27,000, which is the price level where option holders would face the most significant financial loss. The estimated total value of these options was $3.1 billion."

        "content": "1. Understand the market conditions and invest in BTC: Bitcoin may appeal as an attractive investment option in the short term and can reach a new all-time high after its halving though it is unlikely to see the same growth as previous cycles due to increased market size and competition from other digital assets including ETH. Analysts believe that the next halving is already 50% priced in and BTC has the potential to reach $40-50,000 by April 2024. Also, the interest from institutional players in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties has grown leap and bounds. However, a recession can temper the growth leading into the halving while its growth after can still be considerable. A tweet by popular account PlanB summarizes the strategy well \u2013 buy BTC 6 months before the halving (Nov. 2023) and hold for 2 years hence."

        "title": "'Wolf of Wall Street' J. Belfort shares 3 perspectives on Bitcoin's future - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Former stockbroker Jordan Belfort, famously known as the \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d was once skeptical about cryptocurrencies. However, over time, his stance has softened, especially about the future of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAs a result, Belfort has made several predictions about Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory for the coming years. In this regard, Finbold has identified the following three key insights shared by Belfort on Bitcoin\u2019s outlook.\n\n#1 Regulations to be bullish for Bitcoin\n\nAt a time when various global jurisdictions have yet to establish concrete regulations for cryptocurrencies, Belfort sees this as a chance for Bitcoin to increase in value. As a long-time proponent for regulations in the crypto sector, Belfort believes that Bitcoin can flourish in an environment where laws are well-defined.\n\nIn this regard, Belfort has criticized market participants who view regulations as a hindrance to the growth of digital assets. He has pointed out that the absence of laws is the primary catalyst behind the proliferation of scams in the digital currency space.\n\n\u201cEveryone said, \u2018Oh no, the regulators are coming in! So I think it\u2019s a good thing\u2026the sooner that massive regulation comes into the market, the better it is for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and everything else,\u201d said Belfort.\n\n#2 Bitcoin is not going to zero\n\nBelfort\u2019s initial view of cryptocurrencies was cautious, as the former stockbroker regarded the sector as fraudulent. According to a Finbold report, Belfort believed that Bitcoin was destined to have zero value due to what he perceived as fraudulent properties of the maiden crypto.\n\nHowever, Belfort changed his mind after witnessing Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence from the crypto winter of 2018. Additionally, incidents like the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem crash further strengthened his faith in Bitcoin\u2019s reliability.\n\n\u201cAt the time that I really hated crypto, I stand by everything I said about crypto in 2017 except for one thing, I was wrong about Bitcoin going to zero, but I didn\u2019t look closely enough because I just said it\u2019s a scam because it just seemed like that because in all the ear markings of that. <\u2026> When it crashed, and it went down to $3,000, it was still like a multi-billion dollar market. I\u2019m like, wait for a second when things crash, they go like Terra that\u2019s what happens when they\u2019re supposed to go the way. That was the first thing that made me start looking closely,\u201d he noted.\n\n#3 Bitcoin to trade higher despite scams and crypto winter\n\nDuring the 2022 crypto winter, Bitcoin experienced a substantial drop in value, further compounded by high-profile incidents such as the Terra crash and the FTX crypto exchange collapse. However, Belfort emphasized that the turmoil in the crypto space should not lead investors to dismiss Bitcoin or Ethereum (ETH).\n\nNotably, Belfort had previously advised investors to focus solely on Bitcoin and Ethereum for their long-term crypto investments.\n\n\u201cBut just because FTX itself was a scam, that doesn\u2019t mean that you can disregard Bitcoin completely and say it\u2019s worthless or going to zero. The same thing goes for Ethereum,\u201d he noted.\n\nDespite Belfort\u2019s optimistic outlook, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that a range of factors, including regulations, adoption, and macroeconomic factors, will influence Bitcoin\u2019s prospects.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
