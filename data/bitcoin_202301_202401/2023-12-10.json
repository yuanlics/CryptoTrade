        "content": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year.\n\nBitcoin fell Monday as investors took profits after its December rally.\n\nThe price of the cryptocurrency was recently lower by more than 7% at $40,887.81, according to Coinbase, after a big drop Sunday night that at one point took it as low as $40,300. Bitcoin topped $44,000 last week and traded just below that level throughout the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, ether fell 7% Monday to $2,202.92. Solana's SOL token was down 7% as well while Ripple's XRP fell about 8%. According to Coin Metrics, bitcoin and ether are on pace for their worst days since Aug. 18 and March 9, respectively.\n\nCrypto equities were dragged down, too. Coinbase fell about 5%, while MicroStrategy lost 7%. Bitcoin miners dropped double digits, with Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital , the largest mining stocks, lower by 11% and 12%, respectively. Wall Street favorites CleanSpark and Iris Energy were down nearly 15% and 14%, respectively.\n\nThe moves come after a 12% advance for bitcoin in December, according to Coin Metrics, as expectations grew that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in early January. Galaxy Digital estimates the addressable market size of a U.S. bitcoin ETF to be about $14 trillion in the first year after a launch, growing to about $26 trillion in the second year."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s crypto winter appears to be thawing, bouncing to the $43,000-$46,000 range, up 159% from last December as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group. The upward move could be the start of a new cycle.\n\n\"There seems to be a lot of retail investor sentiment that's been sidelined. There hasn't been the hype and excitement that you've seen kind of mid to late cycle of the last crypto rally. So that actually gives us confidence that we're still a little bit early innings, that there's a lot of capital that has a cushion,\" John Todaro, senior research analyst, Needham & Company, told FOX Business.\n\nSeveral tailwinds are fueling the recent run. The Federal Reserve, which ends its final meeting of the year Wednesday, may start cutting rates in March 2024, according to forecasts tracked by the CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool, which would be supportive of cryptos.\n\nPlus, BlackRock and Fidelity have pending applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds filed and under review with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There has been speculation at least one of these could win approval, which would mark the first Bitcoin ETF. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose firm oversees $9 trillion in assets, commented on rumors of a possible approval during an appearance of \"The Claman Countdown\" in October.\n\nFOX BUSINESS' LIVE CRYPTO PRICES: HERE\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BLK BLACKROCK INC. 809.12 -16.92 -2.05%\n\n\"I can't talk about the specifics of anything, I think it's just an example of the pent-up interest in crypto. We are hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto,\" Fink said. Investors, including Todaro are eyeing early January for a possible decision.\n\nMany investors who held Bitcoin when it was trading at the all-time high of $67,802.30 in November 2021, before sinking to the $16,000-$17,000 range, are gun shy, Todaro noted, but he sees a turning point.\n\n\"I think if Bitcoin crosses $50,000, which is a psychological point for a lot of retail investors, I think it starts to see a wave of some of that capital come back,\" he added.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % COIN COINBASE GLOBAL INC. 233.67 -18.06 -7.17%\n\nAdditionally, Todaro has a buy rating on crypto trading exchange Coinbase, which gets 90% of its revenue from retail customers. He notes interest in its app on the Apple store bottomed to No. 40 in February 2023 following the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all charges last month and is facing over 100 years in prison.\n\nFTX KING SAM BANKMAN-FRIED FOUND GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES\n\nSince it has recovered to No. 24 this month, further improvement would correlate with retail investors putting new money to work.\n\nTodaro has a $160 per-share price target on Coinbase.\n\nCoinbase\n\nNot everyone is a believer. Last week JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers during a hearing that cryptocurrencies are for criminals and if he had control of the U.S. government he would \"close it down.\""

        "content": "After hitting its highest point in more than a year last week, Bitcoin is falling back to Earth.\n\nThe top cryptocurrency by market cap was down just over 4% on Monday amid a selloff, trading near $41,800, down from a high of about $43,900 on Sunday. Almost $400 million was liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nStill, the coin maintained well above the key psychological marker of $40,000, pushing some analysts to believe the Monday decline was merely a speed bump on the way to an extended rally. Around $20 million flowed into exchange-traded products tracking Bitcoin last week, bringing year-to-date inflows to $1.7 billion, according to a Monday report by CoinShares.\n\n\u201cA wave of profit-taking hit the cryptocurrency market on Monday morning\u2026we saw a massive exit from long positions in low liquidity before the regular session in Asia. Strong demand for risk assets in traditional markets suggests that the market will try to get back on its previous growth track,\u201d Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at broker FxPro, told Barron\u2019s.\n\nA wave of positive sentiment last week pushed Bitcoin above $44,000, its highest level in 20 months. Fueling the boost was a hope that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a flurry of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early January. Several TradFi giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, are waiting to hear on the status of their applications.\n\nThis week, traders will scrutinize Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for any sign that the central bank will cut rates sooner rather than later. Despite a higher-than-expected jobs report last week, inflation has recently moderated to about 3.2% compared with a high of above 9% in June 2022.\n\nAnalysts point to cooling inflation numbers as a reason to expect more dovishness from Powell at the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting of the year, on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nAlthough the Fed is not expected to cut rates this week, Goldman Sachs predicts at least two rate cuts next year. Any interest rate cut could be a boon for Bitcoin and the overall crypto market, which in recent weeks has moved above a $1.6 trillion market cap from a sub-$1 trillion market cap earlier this year.\n\nAs Bitcoin dropped on Monday, so did altcoins. The second-most popular crypto, Ether, was down 5.5%, and the previously red-hot Solana was down just under 8%. Other popular memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which rode Bitcoin\u2019s coattails to highs last week, were down 5.7% and 7.5%, respectively."

        "content": "In this episode of \u201cThe Bitcoin Verdict,\u201d host and partner Hailey Lennon welcomes partner Matthew Richardson and associate Morgan Jones, who discuss data privacy and cybersecurity regulations and how new technologies like blockchain and AI may be impacted by these regulations.\n\nIn the U.S. where rules differ from state to state, it\u2019s important to work with clients during a data incident to ensure their response follows the rules of the state(s) where their users live, Richardson said.\n\n\u201cIf the data subjects are all in one state, it\u2019s easy, but of course that\u2019s not realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to deal with basically 54 regimes \u2013 that\u2019s all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the USVI,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd each of them has slightly different definitions of what data is, slightly different definitions of a breach, slightly different notification requirements, slightly different time limits for those notification requirements. But mercifully, for any person that comes to us, Morgan and I do this on a daily basis, so we are perfectly capable and happy to analyze the data, analyze the breach and give a very capable and thorough understanding of what has gone on.\u201d\n\nJones added that it\u2019s important for companies to not sit on a breach and try to figure it out on their own, because once it\u2019s discovered, the clock starts ticking on the reporting requirements. He said some states have notification requirements that fall between the 30- and 60-day window, but there are a few where you have to notify either the regulator or the individuals within 10 days or so.\n\nAfter a breach happens, it\u2019s also possible for a company to face investigations into their protocol, depending on the situation, Jones explained.\n\nIn discussing how future data privacy regulations may apply to the blockchain industry, Jones said there are some implicit contradictions between GDPR requirements of the right for data to be deleted and blockchain ledgers that are immutable. For now, Jones noted that regulators are extremely focused on artificial intelligence but may turn their attentions back to blockchain and cryptocurrency in the future.\n\nHe believes the regulations for blockchain will require a different approach than AI because of the ways the different technologies collect and use data.\n\n\u201cI think the general intention of the legislators right now has been turned away a bit to focus more on AI \u2013 that\u2019s the hot button topic right now \u2013 but I think they will eventually circle back to blockchain,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think they\u2019ll take a softer touch to it than AI because AI data is being collected and shared in many instances without the consumer knowing. Whereas blockchain you\u2019re opening yourself up to this. So I think it\u2019s going to take a bit of a lighter touch and it won\u2019t be quite so drastic when it comes to cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nLennon said people who choose to buy crypto are generally very focused on the importance of data privacy, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to enforce those rules.\n\n\u201cFor the crypto industry and blockchain advocates, the immutability and the decentralized aspects perhaps add to an inability to comply, but also an inability to enforce in some ways,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cI know that privacy is important to individuals in the cryptocurrency space, there\u2019s privacy coins, there\u2019s zero-knowledge proof being integrated into some projects, maybe that, in some ways, is where the blockchain technology is headed in the future.\u201d"

Bitcoin fell 3% in the last 24 hours to trade around $42,400 after hitting $45,000 last week. There are a number of factors for the drop in price, with some analysts attributing it to macroeconomic fundamentals. Friday\u2019s economic data from the U.S. came in strong, with better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls and lower employment. The dollar rallied and bitcoin dropped slightly immediately after.

        "title": "These Crypto Executives Think Bitcoin Could Be Worth $100,000 in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC -6.44%) currently trading near an 18-month high of $44,000, it's perhaps no surprise that a number of analysts and investors are now rushing to put out higher price targets for Bitcoin. The growing consensus is that Bitcoin could be on a trajectory to hit $100,000 next year.\n\nAs a result, top executives from within the crypto industry are now chiming in on Bitcoin's prospects for 2024, with many convinced Bitcoin could more than double in value within just 12 months. Let's take a closer look at why they think Bitcoin could be worth $100,000 in 2024.\n\nBitcoin at $100,000?\n\nOne of the most prominent voices calling for a rapid appreciation in the price of Bitcoin is Michael Saylor, chairman (and former CEO) of MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%). His company is one of the world's largest holders of Bitcoin, thanks to a Bitcoin accumulation strategy launched back in August 2020. As of Nov. 30, MicroStrategy held 174,530 Bitcoins acquired at an average price of $30,252. Given Bitcoin's current price of $44,000, MicroStrategy is now sitting on a profit of over $2 billion.\n\nWhile Saylor has not put out an official price target for Bitcoin in 2024, he recently appeared on CNBC in November and said Bitcoin had the potential to 10x in value. Further, in early December, he suggested on social media that \"One day we will all brag about buying five-figure Bitcoin.\" So, it seems safe to assume that he thinks Bitcoin will break through the $100,000 mark soon.\n\nAnd Saylor is not alone. Other crypto executives also think Bitcoin is headed to $100,000 and beyond. Crypto financial services firm Matrixport recently suggested Bitcoin could be headed to $125,000 by the end of 2024. And Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, suggested Bitcoin might hit $100,000 before the next halving, currently scheduled for April 2024.\n\nWall Street joins the Bitcoin party\n\nIt's one thing for crypto executives to be talking up the price of Bitcoin. But it's another thing entirely when prominent voices within the mainstream financial industry are also pondering the prospect of Bitcoin at $100,000. In April, Standard Chartered Bank put out a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin and, in November, reiterated its bullish stance.\n\nAnd don't forget about the prominent institutional investors who are long-term bullish on Bitcoin. One of the leading voices here is Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. Her firm originally put out a $1 million price target for Bitcoin and followed that up with a revised $1.48 million price target for the year 2030. Bitcoin would likely have to soar in value next year to hit that lofty target.\n\nWhy $100,000?\n\nAt this point, it's only natural to ask: Why are so many people convinced that Bitcoin will soar past the $100,000 mark next year? If you analyze the various predictions made by the crypto industry and Wall Street executives, there appear to be two major catalysts.\n\nThe first catalyst is the imminent arrival of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market. A handful of Wall Street firms have already filed exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the current consensus is that approval will come sometime in early 2024. When that happens, a tsunami of new institutional investor money could flood into Bitcoin.\n\nThe second catalyst is the Bitcoin halving, now scheduled for April 2024. This event, which results in the reward paid out to Bitcoin miners being cut in half, takes place only once every four years. In three previous halving cycles, the price of Bitcoin has soared, so the excitement around this next halving cycle is almost palpable. Of course, just remember that past performance is no guarantee of future performance.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nWhile all lights seem to be flashing green right now, keep in mind that a lot could potentially go wrong on the path to $100,000. For one, the SEC might decide that it will never approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. That could be disastrous, given how important the Bitcoin ETF narrative has become. Moreover, the Bitcoin halving could turn out to be a dud, and that, too, would put a serious dent in any bullish Bitcoin forecast.\n\nTaking all of that into account, Bitcoin has a real opportunity to double in value in 2024. Right now, $100,000 seems like a reasonable price target, especially given that Bitcoin has already more than doubled in value this year. As a result, I remain long-term bullish on Bitcoin."

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners Tumble on Bitcoin's Late Night Crash - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -5.65%) miners thought they were on a bull run, but that ended at about 8 p.m. ET on Sunday night when the price of Bitcoin dropped. After trading above $43,900 late in the day, the value of Bitcoin has dropped to $40,900 as of this writing, and most of that drop happened in a matter of minutes last night.\n\nMiners fell across the industry with everyone dropping double digits today. TeraWulf (WULF -4.02%) was down as much as 23.5% in trading, Bit Digital (BTBT -6.67%) dropped 19.7%, Marathon Digital (MARA -7.46%) was down 15.2%, and Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.82%) was off 14.5% at its low.\n\nBitcoin's rapid fall\n\nWeekend trading often has less liquidity than normal trading days so assets will often see bigger moves on Saturday and Sunday. That played a role in yesterday's drop, but shares didn't recover after the fall.\n\nMiners are down even more than Bitcoin because they're a leveraged play on the industry, generating Bitcoin from mining operations as well as holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet. This means the drop in Bitcoin will hurt both the income statement and the balance sheet of these companies.\n\nInvestors are also worried about Bitcoin's next halving, which is expected to take place in 2024. Miners will only get half of the Bitcoins per block as they previously did, which will effectively lower margins for all of these companies.\n\nBitcoin giveth, Bitcoin taketh away\n\nThe drop in Bitcoin is why miners fell today, but the drop in Bitcoin itself is a little mysterious since it came so late in the weekend. Last week's economic news like a strong jobs report would have likely moved the market earlier.\n\nCoinDesk has reported that funding rates of perpetual futures contracts could have led to some of the drop. Funding rates are payments between long and short positions that are collected every eight hours and a positive funding rate indicates futures trade at a premium to the spot market. That funding rate dropped to under 0.1%, indicating less leverage in the market, likely by formerly bullish traders.\n\nBitcoin continues to be a volatile asset and investors need to understand the risk of both cryptocurrency as well as the miners involved in the industry. Bitcoin is being treated by most traders as a store of digital value and a trading asset, which means the value moves with the market's sentiment. As other cryptocurrencies and blockchains improve speed and efficiency, it appears less likely Bitcoin itself, or the Bitcoin blockchain, will be used as a form of payment.\n\nI think the mining stocks are especially risky right now given the volatility in Bitcoin and the upcoming halving. If revenue falls significantly for each block it could put these companies in a precarious position. If you're buying mining stocks, understand that it's a very leveraged position in Bitcoin and may ultimately end in disaster if Bitcoin drops."

        "title": "Are Bitcoin and Crypto-Related Assets Heading for New Highs? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin is the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency asset class. In a November 10 Barchart article highlighting Bitcoin, I wrote:\n\nThe bullish technical break in October 2023 could lead to much higher prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies as investors, trend-following traders, and speculators flock to the asset class. However, the historical trading pattern shows that the higher they rise, the greater the odds of another price implosion. Like a game of speculative musical chairs, when the bullish music stops, buyers become sellers, and prices can plunge.\n\nLast week, Bitcoin rose to over $44,000 per token, the highest level since April 2022. With the leading crypto at high 2023 highs late in the year, a speculative frenzy could take Bitcoin to higher highs over the coming weeks.\n\nThe next technical resistance level is at over $48,000 per token\n\nBitcoin is steaming toward the March 2022 high, the technical resistance area on the long-term chart.\n\nAs the chart dating back to 2010 shows, Bitcoin\u2019s next upside target is $48,187.21, the March 2022 high. Above there, Bitcoin faces resistance at $59,043.43, the December 2021 peak, and $68,906.48, the November 2021 record high.\n\nEthereum rises to a new 2023 high- The technical target is above $3,500 per token\n\nEthereum, the second-leading cryptocurrency, has followed Bitcoin higher, moving to a new 2023 high.\n\nThe chart illustrates at a high of over $2,400 per token on December 8, 2023, Ethereum is moving towards the $3,579.866 peak. Ethereum\u2019s all-time high was $4,865.426 in November 2021.\n\nAt the late 2021 highs, the cryptocurrency asset class\u2019s market cap rose to the $3 trillion level. On December 8, it was over $1.6 trillion. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap was 53.7% of the total, while Ethereum\u2019s was 17.1%. The two leaders had 70.8% of the total market cap. Bitcoin\u2019s was over $860 billion, with Ethereum\u2019s near $275 billion. Tether (USDT) had around a $90 billion market cap and was the third most valuable crypto. However, Tether\u2019s market cap was one-third of second place Ethereum\u2019s, indicating the asset class\u2019s significant value concentration in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nRIOT has a great year with more upside potential\n\nRiot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) is a Bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure company. At the $15.83 per share level on December 8, RIOT had a market cap of over $3.269 billion. RIOT is a highly liquid stock, trading an average of over 26.28 million shares daily.\n\nThe chart shows that after reaching a $3.25 low in late December 2022, RIOT shares have rallied 387% over the past year. Technical resistance is at the July 10, 2023, $20.65 per share, and RIOT traded to $79.50 in February 2021. RIOT could have lots of upside if the rally in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues.\n\nMARA is in a bullish trend\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings Inc. (MARA) also mines cryptocurrencies with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets. At $16.78 per share, MARA\u2019s market cap was around $3.735 billion, with average daily trading volume at nearly 49 million shares.\n\nWhen Bitcoin reached its bottom, MARA reached a $3.11 per share low in late 2022. At $16.78 on December 8, MARA was over 439.5% higher. Technical resistance is at the July 2023 $19.88 high. In November 2021, when Bitcoin peaked, MARA traded to $83.45 per share. Like RIOT, MARA will track Bitcoin higher or lower over the coming weeks and months.\n\nBITQ moves towards a critical resistance level\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) tracks the performance of companies involved in blockchain and the digital currency asset class. At $10.18 per share on December 8, BITQ had around $115.3 million in assets under management. The ETF trades an average of more than 180,000 shares daily and charges a 0.85% management fee.\n\nAfter trading to a $3.20 low in late December 2022, BITQ has more than tripled over the past year. Technical resistance is at the July $11.34 high. BITQ traded to a record high of $35.68 in November 2021.\n\nThe trend is always your best friend in markets. Cryptocurrencies, a highly speculative asset class, have a history of boom-and-bust price action. They are back in boom mode after reaching significant bottoms in late 2022. If Bitcoin and Ethereum are moving towards a challenge of the November 2021 record highs, expect RIOT, MARA, and BITQ to follow on the upside. These liquid stocks are regulated and do not require computer wallets or holding cryptos on platforms.\n\nThe upside potential comes with commensurate risks. Only invest capital you are willing to lose in the cryptocurrency asset class, as the oversized reward potential involves the risk of a total loss.\n\nMore Crypto News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrew Hecht did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bitcoin and ether still need to pump by about half to see their respective all-time highs. Not these cryptocurrencies.\n\nBittensor (TAO), the token that incentivizes competition between artificial intelligence models, hit highs over the weekend after launching in March.\n\nTAO has now more than tripled since its first trading day, converting to 900% gains from its lows posted in May.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s first-ever BRC-20 token (ORDI) also hit an all-time high last week. ORDI was minted to show that Ordinals can do (almost) everything that Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens can, including trade at billion-dollar valuations despite having little utility beyond being a great meme.\n\nORDI is up more than 160% since it opened six months ago and 14 times higher than record lows posted only in September.\n\nRead more: Ethereum won\u2019t flip Bitcoin anytime soon, but Ordinals could change that\n\nThere\u2019s Kaspa (KAS), the native crypto for the layer-1 blockchain of the same name. Kaspa presents itself as a follower of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Monero, in that it\u2019s fully mineable without, purportedly, any central leader.\n\nKAS, which can be mined alongside Ethereum forks ethereum classic (ETC) and ethereum pow (ETHW), has multiplied by almost 600 times since its launch last May. It hit an all-time high three weeks ago and has so far retraced by one-fifth.\n\nBONK, the premier dog-themed cryptocurrency on Solana, recently flipped pepe (PEPE) to become the third-most valuable memecoin behind shiba inu (SHIB) and dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nBONK hit its highest point ever on Saturday \u2014 $0.00001464 \u2014 after rocketing 7,500% over the past two months.\n\nBONK is an outlier over the past month\n\nCrypto exchange tokens are even getting a run. Bitget (BGB), launched in 2020 and OKX\u2019s OKB, first traded in 2018, are up 170% over the past year and both set price records one month ago.\n\nUsers of those exchanges can spend the respective tokens on trading fees and initial coin offerings.\n\nRollbit (RLB), the native crypto for the popular exchange-slash-casino, also traded at its highest point ever in November. RLB has exploded 7,500% over the past year and was first issued in March 2022.\n\nAnother four cryptocurrencies in the top 100 or so hit their own highs over the past month, but they don\u2019t really count as they\u2019ve only been around less than six months.\n\nSEI, the token for the self-styled \u201cfastest layer-1\u201d of the same name, set a record last week after launching in August.\n\nTIA, for blockchain data network Celestia, also hit an all-time high last week after launching in October.\n\nPYTH, for the oracle network hoping to rival Chainlink, launched in late November and set a price record only four days later.\n\nJTO, the DAO governance token for liquid Solana staking protocol Jito, is just scaling back from highs set two days after its Dec. 7 airdrop.\n\n(A special mention for Solana rival injective (INJ), which launched in 2020 and floated around all-time high over the weekend but, unfortunately, didn\u2019t quite clear it this time around.)\n\n\u201cAltcoin season\u201d may seem well and truly here. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance \u2014 which measures how much of the crypto market is BTC \u2014 has hovered around 50% for the better part of the past six months and crypto bulls could look for that figure to shrink as a major rally is confirmed.\n\nAll these cryptocurrencies indeed set highs against the US dollar over the past month. But not all have hit price records against bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn those cases, it seems more likely that bitcoin\u2019s own price rally played a significant role in boosting their valuations. That could convert to outsized losses should bitcoin fail to maintain its recent gains for an extended period.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear, though, is these recent all-time highs in other cryptocurrencies have barely made a dent.\n\nNow, we all wait for bitcoin.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

This is effectively digital gold,\" the SkyBridge Capital founder said on Monday. By that comparison, he said that bitcoin's market capitalization could eventually reach as high as $12 trillion.\n\n\"So bitcoin's got a lot of room ahead, but again, small pieces for individual investors is what we recommend,\" Scaramucci said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis own firm began with a 5% exposure, but it has grown as bitcoin appreciated, he said. Since the start of 2023, the world's biggest crypto token has jumped 145%, and was sharply boosted in the past month amid renewed enthusiasm around events including the potential regulatory approval of a spot ETF and the halving coming up in 2024/\n\nIf approved, spot bitcoin ETFs are expected to direct fresh demand into the market, helping the token reach as much as $150,000 by 2025. Supply-side factors will also drive the upside, especially with a bitcoin halving cycle scheduled for April.\n\nSince last week's gains, bitcoin has slid aggressively, with a steep slide in a matter of minutes Sunday evening erasing most of the gains over the prior week.\n\nGiven that bitcoin should be a long-term investment, Scaramucci also noted that it will help diversify portfolios and decrease correlation risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If we're right, it will impact your portfolio positively, it will offer some lack of correlation to some of the other assets,\" Scaramucci said. \"If you look at monthly returns this year in bitcoin even when the S&P was not doing well, bitcoin did well. And it does have over time I think a decoupling effect to the stock and bond market.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price finally witnessed a significant 7% pullback on Dec. 11 as multiple indicators flashed sell signals and traders booked profits. Bitcoin\u2019s ability to hold above $42,000 will determine whether this crash is a buy-the-dip opportunity or a general market reversal.\n\nShort-term volatility or big trend reversal?\n\nThe sharp BTC price drop observed on the daily chart corresponds with a sudden 6.5% drawdown and over $300 million long liquidations across the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hr candle chart. Source: Bitstamp\n\nZooming to the longer 1-day candle timeframe, however, this movement appears as a minor retracement in a more extensive bullish trend established over the past few months. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) has retreated into neutral territory below 70.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart. Source: Bitstamp\n\nLast week\u2019s analysis confirmed the strong uptrend that Bitcoin has been in, with significant momentum observed after the price breached the $40,000 mark.\n\nThis context suggests that the recent dip could be a short-term fluctuation within a continuing upward trend rather than a general trend reversal, though more downside or sideways actions should not be ruled out for the days ahead.\n\nKey BTC price levels to watch\n\nAs noted earlier, important levels to watch include $31,860, $28,050, and $25,200, which have been significant since 2021.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin dominance threatens \u2018likely top\u2019 despite BTC price eyeing $45K\n\nTherefore, the fact that the BTC price has not approached these levels and the recent uptrend has been strong enough to surpass minor resistance levels with ease supports the argument that the current price action is within the bounds of a healthy correction rather than a bearish trend reversal.\n\nHealthy corrections in a bull market\n\nCorrections are considered a normal part of every upward trend. They are typically seen as healthy for the market because they allow for consolidation and can shake out weak hands, as demonstrated by the volatility in mid-November.\n\nIf followed by a strong bounce, the current drop would indicate that the market is still in a positive trend and traders are buying the dip.\n\nHence, the latest price drop must be viewed in the context of the longer-term trend, and it seems more indicative of a temporary dip within a bullish phase rather than a complete trend reversal, at least so far.\n\nBTC price drawdown from all-time high. Source: Glassnode\n\nBut, one must also consider that previous Bitcoin bull markets have all seen pullbacks of well over 20%, as shown above by the long drawdown wicks during each bull market phase.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin could still drop much further without halting the overall uptrend. However, its ability to hold above $42,000 will further strengthen the argument that this was just a short-term dip and sentiment remains overall bullish.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

For example, Roundhill Investments recently announced it was shuttering its Roundhill MEME ETF (MEME) after the fund failed to gain traction with its targeted audience of retail traders.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nFees, liquidity and brand recognition will be key factors that investors will use to differentiate funds, according to both fund issuers and analysts.\n\nIn an interview with etf.com in November, Cathie Wood, who operates spot bitcoin ETF hopeful issuer ARK Invest, said that if multiple spot bitcoin ETFs are launched at the same time, firms will jockey to win over both institutional and retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt's a marketing game from there, although some people would call it a war,\u201d Wood said.\n\nThat issuers are updating their tickers is also a sign that firms are in the final stages of amending their applications. The ETF issuers who have been in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission have narrowed down the agency\u2019s concerns to a few key details, according to Reuters.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrency Platforms That Could Outperform Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Amid the rally in the cryptocurrency market, now is the time to consider some cryptos that are better than Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Although BTC may never be usurped from its throne as the king of decentralized currencies, it may not be as flexible or robust as others in specific situations. Furthermore, diversifying one\u2019s portfolio with different coins may lead to stronger gains overall.\n\nSo, in this article, we\u2019ll discuss three cryptos that are better than Bitcoin. That way, you can unlock more value from your portfolio and expose yourself to different segments of the market.\n\nHere are three coins for you to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nConcept graphic of Ethereum Classic (ETC) crypto logo in green techno style\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/BT Side\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) wins over Bitcoin due to better ecosystem support and more efficient use of energy through proof-of-stake.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be monolithic, Ethereum is comparatively more diverse due to the community\u2019s ability to host and scale decentralized applications on its platforms and allow investors to stake their Ethereum-based tokens for strong APY returns.\n\nWhat\u2019s better is that while the market is focused on a proposed Bitcoin ETF, there\u2019s also an Ether ETF proposal in the making. Companies like Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FNF) have submitted applications for an ETF over the past few years, and more are expected to be lodged in the future. That would give retail investors and institutions direct exposure to ETH without owning the underlying, offloading custody risk and making it generally more accessible overall.\n\nThat makes ETH one of those cryptos that are better than Bitcoin.\n\nCardano (ADA-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Cardano (ADA). Cardano Price Predictions\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCardano (ADA-USD) stands out for its research-driven approach to blockchain development with its Ouroboros network. Although ADA also uses proof-of-work, its architecture is designed to be less energy-intensive than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nADA stands out as a pick because if history repeats itself as in previous rallies, altcoins should also rally along with Bitcoin and for a few weeks after the upcoming halving event. What gives ADA an advantage in this case is its market capitalization, which stands at an eighth position in Coinmarketcap\u2019s rankings.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince ADA\u2019s market cap is far smaller than Bitcoin\u2019s, and the total amount of coins in circulation for ADA is not far off Bitcoin\u2019s max supply, ADA could undergo a far stronger rally amid the halving event. Some analysts predict that it could increase by 2,800%.\n\nUnlike other altcoins that come and go, ADA has stood the test of time and is one of those tokens most investors would keep in their portfolios whether a massive rally takes place, finding the sweet spot between risk and reward. That puts it on the list of cryptos that are better than Bitcoin.\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nAbstract 3d rendered coin solana (SOL-USD)\n\nSource: solvertv / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) is my risky contrarian play to ride out the halving event and for a long-term hold. SOL is known for its exceptionally high throughput and low transaction costs via its unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism combined with proof-of-stake.\n\nUnfortunately, SOL took an enormous reputational hit amid the FTX exchange collapsing in 2022. At one point, it had lost 94.2% of its value. Most of the damage came from Sam Bankman-Fried praising the token despite a lack of direct exposure to FTX and Alameda Research.\n\nSOL could be undervalued and oversold. Its all-time high was $260, but it currently trades for around $69.56 at the time of writing. It then has a lot of room to surge higher to make up for the ground it lost in the FTX fiasco.\n\nThen, on a fundamental level, some analysts have posited that SOL could further benefit from the rise of meme coins in its ecosystems. These coins are wildly speculative as they usually have no utility or real intrinsic value besides what someone is willing to pay. Due to their fundamentals, they could rise the most out of all ecosystem tokens.\n\nSome of the hottest meme coins, like Bonk (BONK-USD), are based on SOL, so owning the underlying may give investors good exposure to a solid network as well as potentially explosive gains moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "This Bitcoin Investment Could Give Crypto Investors a Double-Win - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets have been volatile in recent years, with the crypto winter crushing Bitcoin (BTC -5.65%) and many of its digital asset peers in 2022. However, Bitcoin has bounced back with a vengeance, and crypto investors are now pouring back into the market to take advantage of what they hope will be a sustained rebound in prices in the sector.\n\nPart of what's fueling speculation about a long-term rise for Bitcoin is the prospect for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve an exchange-traded fund that owns Bitcoin directly. Such a fund could have advantages over the current futures-based ETFs that are currently available.\n\nBut there's actually a fund that exists currently that owns spot Bitcoin. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -5.76%) has been around for years, and although it hasn't gotten regulatory approval from the SEC to be a true ETF, investors are increasingly optimistic that it could do so in the near future. If that happens, then early investors could actually get an unexpected double win.\n\nThe origins of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nGrayscale originally created its Bitcoin trust to give investors a way to participate directly in the price changes of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust offered shares to institutional and accredited investors without having to do a full registration process with the SEC. Grayscale then took that money and purchased Bitcoin with it. Each share, therefore, represented a fraction of a Bitcoin.\n\nTo be clear, though, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was not set up like an ETF. Fund shareholders have no right to redeem their shares for actual Bitcoin. Even institutional investors lack the ability to buy and sell new shares on the open market in the same manner as ETF shares. In many ways, the trust more closely resembled a closed-end fund with a set number of shares -- particularly when Bitcoin prices tumbled and interest in cryptocurrency waned.\n\nFrom premium to discount...\n\nIt's that locked-in aspect of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust that was so damaging to shareholders when crypto winter set in. At the beginning of 2021, demand for Bitcoin was so strong that investors were willing to pay 25% more for trust shares than the value of the proportional amount of Bitcoin each share represented. That was with Bitcoin at about $30,000, and the cryptocurrency would double to more than $60,000 within the first couple months of the year.\n\nBy the end of 2022, however, Bitcoin prices had sunk to $17,000. Even worse, Grayscale shares traded at a nearly 50% discount to the value of the underlying Bitcoin. As a result, shareholders suffered losses of almost 75% during that two-year stretch -- far worse even than the roughly 50% haircut the cryptocurrency itself experienced.\n\n... and back again?\n\nIn 2023, however, the opposite has happened. Improving Bitcoin prices have led more investors to purchase Grayscale trust shares, in turn narrowing the discount. As of Dec. 7, trust shares traded at just 12% below the value of the fund's underlying Bitcoin holdings. The total return for Grayscale shareholders so far in 2023 has been over 300% -- crushing even the 165% gains in Bitcoin itself year to date.\n\nIf Grayscale Bitcoin Trust succeeds in getting approval as a true ETF, moreover, there would likely be immediate gains for shareholders. An SEC-approved ETF would have provisions that would provide a mechanism for redemptions. The ability to use arbitrage would in turn make the remaining discount largely disappear.\n\nWith just a 12% discount remaining, the potential double-win for Bitcoin investors in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust isn't nearly as large as it once was. Yet those who are bullish on the cryptocurrency market generally might enjoy the possibility of getting a modest sweetener on top of their Bitcoin returns."

        "title": "Prediction: Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Trillion in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -6.44%) has been a massive winner in 2023. The world's leading digital asset has skyrocketed 163% (as of Dec. 7).\n\nBitcoin's current market cap is $847 billion. Naturally, investors have their sights set on the coveted $1 trillion mark. Perhaps this will put the top cryptocurrency on the radar of more of the financial and investment community.\n\nHitting this number translates to an 18% gain from today's value. Not only do I think Bitcoin will hit this mark sometime in 2024, but I think $1 trillion could happen before the end of 2023.\n\nIs there a better environment for Bitcoin?\n\nThe current situation could not be any better for Bitcoin. Here's why.\n\nIn April 2024, Bitcoin will undergo what's known as a halving. This is an event that happens roughly every four years, and it cuts the rate at which new Bitcoin supply enters the market.\n\nPast halving events have been extremely bullish for this cryptocurrency, both before and after they happen. We are seeing this right now, with strong momentum pushing up Bitcoin's price by 25% in the last month.\n\nThe recent price action might also be a direct result of optimism building for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) to finally hit the market. BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, Invesco, and WisdomTree, among others, have all filed applications to introduce this product. The Securities and Exchange Commission could hand out approvals at the start of next year.\n\nThere is certainly a lot of anticipation for this. Spot ETFs would essentially legitimize Bitcoin in the financial services industry. Plus, they could open up lots of fresh capital from people who want exposure to Bitcoin with a product that has been approved by regulators and is easy to trade.\n\nWe've seen inflation start to come down in recent months. And to the Federal Reserve, this could be viewed as a clear signal that its effort to curb rising prices across the economy by aggressively hiking interest rates is working. This could prompt the central bank to cut rates sometime in 2024. This would be another bullish catalyst for a risky asset like Bitcoin.\n\nThis is a great environment for Bitcoin to shine.\n\nThink about the long term\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in what's happening right now and what the next several months will hold. But to be clear, no one should buy Bitcoin unless they plan to hold it for the next five or 10 years. This is a long-term investment and should be treated as such.\n\nBesides the catalysts I mentioned above, why else would anyone want to own Bitcoin? I believe it comes down to one critical reason.\n\nA conversation about Bitcoin centers on the fact that it has absolute scarcity. There can be only 21 million coins. This is based on a fixed supply cap that is set in Bitcoin's software. This number could change, but only if the majority of nodes accept it. Many experts believe this is extremely unlikely.\n\nSo we have an asset with a fixed supply that is going up against a world in which fiat, or government-backed, currencies are constantly increasing in number. Bitcoin can be viewed as an attractive store of value.\n\nAlthough, like a growth tech stock, it's volatile, which might be hard for some folks to handle. Bitcoin has done a magnificent job at increasing its holders' purchasing power over the years.\n\nI view a $1 trillion market cap as extremely likely. But looking out even further, Bitcoin's value could be much higher than that."

The price of ETH has since stabilized and is trading for $2,233, down 5.3% on the day.\n\nOther large-cap crypto assets, including BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL), also posted losses.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGlass, the brief drop caused more than $270 million worth of long positions to be liquidated.

        "title": "One-hour Bitcoin block times: What do they mean, and are they frequent? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) block that took over an hour to mine made headlines earlier in November. This is despite Bitcoin\u2019s core protocol being written to aim to mine a block every 10 minutes.\n\nBlock 815,690 is the latest outlier to generate press speculation. This block took one hour and nine minutes to mine on Nov. 7. Public interest in an hour-plus confirmation time is not a singular event. Roughly once or twice a year, a media outlet picks up on a long block validation event and decides to run with the story.\n\nOn Oct. 17, 2022, a prominent crypto news site reported on a block that took one hour and 25 minutes to mine, which spurred a flurry of similar reports. As the story spread widely on social media, some fans reveled in the relative speed of their favored centralized altcoin.\n\nThe report eventually caught the attention of Lighting Network founder Tadge Dryja, who was decidedly unimpressed.\n\nAs Dryja pointed out on X (formerly Twitter): \u201cA time between blocks of 85 minutes happens every 34 days or so (assuming no difficulty changes, etc).\u201d\n\nDryja\u2019s point was clear: A single long block alone is no cause for alarm. Given the regularity of longer blocks, Dryja questioned whether the article would be a new monthly feature for the publication.\n\nProbability is tricky\n\nWhile almost everyone who knows about Bitcoin understands that the coin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is a puzzle of computational guesswork, the math that underpins this knowledge is infinitely harder to understand.\n\nThe probability of an hour-long block occurring is relatively low, and it is also higher than humans intuitively expect. Most of the time, longer blocks go unnoticed, at least by the press.\n\nThis might help to explain why longer blocks become a talking point whenever someone stumbles across them.\n\nRecent: Bitcoin\u2019s many deaths: Is crypto market past \u2018point of no return?\u2019\n\nIn February 2021, a crypto community member on X, Bitcoin Jack, noticed that one hour and 46 minutes passed between blocks 670,637 and 670,638. That\u2019s just one block confirmed where 10 or 11 would typically be expected.\n\nJack tagged cypherpunk and Bitcoin advocate Jameson Lopp to ask how common such occurrences were. Lopp confirmed that 190 blocks had taken 106 minutes or more to mine in the previous 12 years. It\u2019s worth remembering, however, that in its earliest years, Bitcoin blocks more regularly took longer to mine, which skews the figures slightly.\n\nVery unusual blocks\n\nHour-long plus blocks are more commonplace than most Bitcoiners might guess, but some blocks are more extreme.\n\nOne such block came immediately after Satoshi Nakamoto mined the Genesis Block on Jan. 3, 2009. That block is probably the most famous in Bitcoin\u2019s history. Learning its inscription \u201c03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d is practically a Bitcoin right of passage.\n\nThe next block in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is far less known but no less fascinating. The second block wasn\u2019t mined until six days later, on Jan. 9. Bitcoin fans have speculated on its meaning \u2014 or whether it means anything at all.\n\nSome theorists even claim the six-day waiting period is a Biblical allegory \u2014 let there be Bitcoin. Whatever the truth, the time interval between these two blocks remains the longest in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\nOn the flip side, there are blocks with roughly the same timestamp as their predecessors, while others have timestamps that predate their forebearers. Of course, timestamps are not always accurate, especially since human hands can adjust the clocks on Bitcoin miners.\n\nAccording to timestamp codes, Bitcoin block 156,113 was mined On Dec. 5 at 8:16 am. Those same codes reveal that Bitcoin block 156,114 was mined on Dec. 5 at 6:17 am \u2014 one hour 59 minutes earlier.\n\nThat would be a neat trick if accurate, but the likely cause of these time-related shenanigans is a miscalibrated clock on the mining equipment.\n\nBitcoin: A self-righting machine\n\nUnderstanding block times is tricky because it relies on probability, but other factors complicate matters further. For one thing, the number of miners on the network is in constant flux.\n\nTo ensure the 10-minute average is maintained, Bitcoin mining difficulty can be adjusted every 2,016 blocks. If the average is too high, then difficulty is lowered; if it is too low, difficulty is increased.\n\nWhen Lopp investigated Bitcoin block times in 2021, he concluded that \u201cBy analyzing the actual distribution of block times we can see that the math behind the targeted block time of 10 minutes has held up quite well over the past 12 years and the few edge case aberrations can be easily explained.\u201d\n\nIn the last five years, for every month barring one, the mean block interval on the Bitcoin blockchain landed within a minute of its target. In three out of the last five years, the yearly average landed within 10 seconds of the 10-minute target.\n\nBy these metrics, the Bitcoin network is becoming more stable and reliable over time.\n\nThe single \u201cedge case\u201d in this period occurred in June 2021. At the tail end of May 2021, China banned Bitcoin mining. The result was a drastic fall in the network\u2019s computational power mining blocks. In June, the Bitcoin mean block time hit 732 seconds \u2014 over two minutes longer than the target period \u2014 as the network dealt with the knock-on effects.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US\n\nIt took until Dec. 2021 for the network hash rate to recover to previous levels, but thanks to the difficulty adjustment, the 10-minute window was reestablished in July.\n\nIn Nov. 2018, during the depths of crypto winter, average block times rose to 670 seconds. This occurred as miners switched off older, less efficient mining equipment that was no longer profitable in the face of reduced Bitcoin prices.\n\nIn both of these instances, the network self-corrected the following month. As far as longer blocks are concerned, the Bitcoin network is a battle-tested self-righting machine."

        "title": "How to Analyze Cryptocurrency: The Basics - Investopedia",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency investing can be a great way to diversify investments, but figuring out which cryptocurrency is suitable and which isn\u2019t can be challenging. To make an informed investment decision, it is important to know how to analyze cryptocurrencies.\n\nKey Takeaways Investing in cryptocurrency requires a basic understanding of what it is.\n\nWhen choosing a crypto, you should learn about the project and what its vision is.\n\nCryptocurrency analysis is similar to fundamental analysis of stocks.\n\nIf a project makes promises but doesn't discuss how it is solving a problem, it might not be a good investment.\n\n\n\n1. Review the White Paper\n\nMost crypto projects provide a white paper, which helps define the objectives and technical details about the blockchain and its cryptocurrency's role. True white papers contain terms and language data scientists, programmers, and developers understand. For instance, Solana has a whitepaper that describes how the blockchain will work and what the token is used for.\n\nCybertruck's white paper, on the other hand, does not\u2014it is a flashy website that talks about the potential for building a community. A disclaimer at the bottom of the webpage states, \"$CYBERTRUCK is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless.\"\n\nA cryptocurrency with utility or a reason to exist should have a white paper that clearly defines the project's goals, how it will achieve them, and how the cryptocurrency will function. Legitimate white papers define a problem being solved with the blockchain and token, and this problem and solution should be crystal clear to investors.\n\n2. Research the Team\n\nCryptocurrencies are typically created by a team of founders and software developers who help create the solution to a problem. To better understand how a project could perform, you should research the professional experience of the project team.\n\nThis may include reviewing LinkedIn profiles to learn about the professional background of any of the technical or leadership staff and the previous projects that the team members have launched. Also, the \u201cAbout\u201d page on any cryptocurrency\u2019s website should clearly articulate who is helping build the project and what their expertise entails.\n\nA red flag would be a team of anonymous founders or developers who don\u2019t reveal their identity publicly or an inexperienced team that has not built or scaled any projects in the past.\n\n3. Learn About the Leadership\n\nCrypto projects with the potential to make a difference have a clearly defined executive team that handles the execution, financials, and marketing. Learning more about who is leading a cryptocurrency team can give insight into the probability of success for a project.\n\nHere are a few questions to ask when researching a crypto project's leadership:\n\nDo they have a history of successful leadership positions?\n\nAre they reputable/well-known leaders?\n\nDo they have a history in the crypto industry? Is it good or bad?\n\nAre they public-facing or anonymous?\n\nWhile some projects with anonymous founders have had success, such as Bitcoin, there are others with bad intentions. The cryptocurrency is likely not legitimate if the project's leadership is sketchy or if it avoids important topics.\n\n4. Get to Know the Community\n\nMost cryptocurrencies are community-driven projects that typically require a strong, supportive community to grow. Learning about a cryptocurrency's community can help you gauge whether a project will succeed or if it is pure hype and speculation.\n\nJoining the community's Discord or Telegram channel can help you learn more about it, as well as get your questions about the project itself answered. If a large community base is well-organized and frequently promotes the project, it could be a sign that a cryptocurrency has the potential to grow. Communities should be discussing issues with the blockchain and improvements that could be made or have other similar discussions\u2014in addition to the regular conversations that might occur between people with similar interests. If all you find is hype and pumping, it is a good bet that the cryptocurrency project is not legitimate.\n\n5. Understand the Technology\n\nCryptocurrencies are a new concept built on distributed systems that have existed for decades. The original intent behind them was to remove human involvement (and thus corruption, mistakes, and third-party profits) from financial systems. If you can gain even a partial understanding of how blockchains work and can be used to solve problems, you'll have an upper hand in deciding whether a cryptocurrency is worth investing in.\n\nHowever, you don't need to know how to program or maintain a blockchain\u2014but learning what a token is, what the blockchain does, how it is maintained, what is stored on a blockchain, and how the blockchain is interacted with by users is essential for would-be investors. Otherwise, you're only speculating on prices and hoping the coin becomes popular.\n\n6. Understand the Vision\n\nCryptocurrencies should have a clear vision of their goals, with a road map that estimates how they will get there. This should be readily available in the white paper and on its website. The vision of a crypto project should give enough details for you to understand what problems it is solving and the potential user base.\n\nFor example, if a website has statements like \u201ccryptocurrency is the future\u201d but does not define or articulate a clear vision for how the cryptocurrency solves a specific user problem, it is a red flag.\n\n7. Review the Road Map\n\nThe road map for a cryptocurrency project is a timeline of events that shows its expected progress. Typically shown on a line graph, the road map should have clear and concise milestones broken down on a quarterly basis, all moving the project toward a predefined set of goals.\n\nThe road map may be available in the white paper, though most crypto project timelines are ever-changing and are listed on a website. If there is no defined road map, or if the milestones are too generic (or based on money raised or earned), it is a red flag.\n\n8. Learn the Tokenomics\n\nThe term \"tokenomics\" refers to the distribution, circulation, and total supply of a given cryptocurrency. This is important, as it affects the overall price of a cryptocurrency over time. Similar to shares of stock in a publicly traded company, the price of a given cryptocurrency reflects supply and demand. The more shares there are, the more demand there needs to be to increase the price.\n\nHere are three important data points to review before investing in any cryptocurrency:\n\nCirculating supply : The cryptocurrency currently in the market\n\n: The cryptocurrency currently in the market Total supply : The total amount of cryptocurrency issued, including those that have been removed from circulation\n\n: The total amount of cryptocurrency issued, including those that have been removed from circulation Maximum supply: The maximum amount of tokens that will ever be issued\n\nAll three of these statistics can greatly affect the price of a given cryptocurrency, so understanding supply is essential for cryptocurrency investors.\n\nSome cryptocurrency projects use uneven token distribution methods to try and influence prices. Reviewing the token unlock schedule can help you understand how the tokens will be distributed and to whom they will go. Projects that give the founders a large portion of tokens at release should be viewed with a skeptic's glasses.\n\n9. Review the Data\n\nCryptocurrency prices are known to swing up and down wildly. One reason for these wild swings is that investors do not want to be left out of the next big price jump, nor do they want to be left holding a cryptocurrency that has dropped significantly in price (unless they are very bullish about it).\n\nUsers influence prices as well, paying for cryptocurrency at the going market rate, but this activity is much less significant an influence than investing and trading.\n\nCryptocurrency prices also react, sometimes explosively, to news and events because of investor anticipation. For example, Bitcoin halvings are believed by many investors to be events that increase its price because there is a reduction in the rate at which new coins are introduced. However, what's really causing the price changes is demand because investors associate the event with a price jump\u2014so they start buying more, causing the price to increase.\n\nThe price of the cryptocurrency you're reviewing should follow the same trends other cryptocurrencies have because traders and investors will generally treat them the same as they do other investments. Prices that seem out of place should raise an eyebrow.\n\nWhat Are Cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies are virtual currencies not controlled or supported by any central authority like banks. Instead, transactions and ownership data are stored on a blockchain.\n\nIs Investing in Crypto Safe? Investing in cryptocurrency is a speculative investment. While it is not necessarily considered a \u201csafe investment,\u201d it can be a viable option for portfolio diversification. Cryptocurrency can be a smaller part of a larger investment portfolio, characterized as a risky asset with more volatility than most investments.\n\n\n\nWhat Are the Popular Cryptocurrencies? There are many popular cryptocurrencies on the market, but the simplest way to gauge the popularity of a given cryptocurrency is market capitalization. This is the measurement of the total value of cryptocurrency based on the current price and circulating supply of tokens. Here are some popular cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap (as of December 2023): Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Tether (USDT) BNB (BNB) XRP\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA cryptocurrency analysis involves examining all the available information about a digital asset. Understanding and researching the topic helps you to determine why it's priced the way it is and whether it is worth investing in.\n\n\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) starts a key week for macro markets with a bump as the weekly close gives way to a sharp 7% BTC price correction.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency broke down toward $40,000 in a fresh bout of volatility, reaching its lowest level in a week.\n\nArguably long overdue, Bitcoin\u2019s return to test support nonetheless caught bullish latecomers by surprise, liquidating almost $100 million in longs.\n\nThe snap move provides a rude awakening for BTC investors at the start of a week, which already holds a multitude of potential volatility triggers. These come in the form of United States macro data that will immediately precede the Federal Reserve\u2019s next decision on interest rate policy.\n\nA bumper collection of numbers coming in swift succession means anything can happen on risk assets \u2014 and crypto is no exception.\n\nFresh from its first downward mining difficulty adjustment in three months, meanwhile, it appears that Bitcoin is finally cooling after weeks of practically unchecked upside.\n\nWhat could happen before the year is out?\n\nTraders and analysts alike are gearing up for curveballs into the 2023 candle close, and with just three weeks to go, BTC price action suddenly feels a lot less certain.\n\n7% BTC price correction wipes longs\n\nBitcoin volatility returned immediately after a flat weekend as soon as the weekly close was done.\n\nHowever, this time, bulls suffered as BTC/USD fell more than 7% in hours to bottom at $40,660 on Bitstamp. This included a 5% drop in a matter of minutes, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart.

Cross-crypto long liquidations for the day stood at over $300 million.\n\nCrypto liquidations chart (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass\n\nA substantial BTC price correction was already anticipated.

This implies that Bitcoin holds a relatively higher value compared to stablecoins, indicating that market participants attribute greater value to Bitcoin, which has been a driving factor in Bitcoin\u2019s price increase,\u201d contributing analyst Woo Minkyu wrote in one of CryptoQuant\u2019s Quicktake market updates on Dec. 9.\n\n\u201cHowever, historically, some investors have shown a preference for converting Bitcoin into stablecoins, suggesting that there might be a short-term price correction in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBitcoin stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) annotated chart.

Note that the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) shows that its has been massively overbought since Dec. 5.\n\nBTC/USD daily RSI chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThis is an early sign that buying pressure could eventually diminish, as traders saw the rally running out of steam and potentially chose to book profits.\n\nBitcoin price faces stiff resistance around $44,000\n\nThe ongoing correction in the Bitcoin market is due to the stiffness of the barrier around the $44,000 supply zone. The Lookintobitcoin golden ratio multiplier indicator, which explores Bitcoin\u2019s adoption curve and market cycles, shows that the 1.6 multiplier target has now been reached around the $44,000 area. Note that BTC has been stuck here for the past week, \u201cunable to break above it convincingly.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Golden Multiplier Chart. Source: Lookintobitcoin\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin\u2019s price is facing fierce rejection from this supplier congestion area, making it a tough hurdle to jump for the bulls.\n\nThe stiffness of the barrier at $44,000 is accentuated by on-chain data from IntoTheBlock\u2019s \u201cin/out of the money around price\u201d (IOMAP) model (shown below). According to the IOMAP chart, this level lies in the $43,346\u2013$44,627 price range, where approximately 585.77 BTC was previously bought by roughly 1.43 million addresses.\n\nBitcoin IOMAP chart.

According to the chart below, the BTC exchange flow balance now stands at -347.\n\nBitcoin exchange flow. Source: Santiment\n\nThe negative reading shows BTC outflows eclipsing inflows, suggesting that investors are more inclined to hold than sell, which is a bullish sign.\n\nThis suggests that the latest dip toward $40,000 could be a short-term correction giving traders an opportunity to buy more on the dip before continuing the upward trend.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Bitcoin traded above all the major moving averages, which maintained their upward trajectory. Notably, these chart overlay indicators presented areas of strong support on the downside.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence indicator (MACD) was still moving above the neutral line in the positive region. The MACD line (blue) was still positioned above the signal line (orange) after crossing above it on Oct. 16, suggesting that the market conditions still favored the upside.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart: Source: TradingView\n\nTherefore, BTC\u2019s price will likely continue to rise from the current levels, with buyers targeting a break above $44,000. Note that a clear breakout above this level could see Bitcoin rise to tag the $50,000 psychological level going into the New Year when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to make a decision on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications or in the spring of 2024 when the next Bitcoin halving event takes place.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) flagged Bitcoin\u2019s inscriptions as a cybersecurity risk on Dec. 9, calling attention to the security flaw that enabled the development of the Ordinals Protocol in 2022.\n\nAccording to the database records, a datacarrier limit can be bypassed by masking data as code in some Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots versions. \"As exploited in the wild by Inscriptions in 2022 and 2023,\" reads the document.\n\nBeing added to the NVD\u2019s list means that a specific cybersecurity vulnerability has been recognized, cataloged, and deemed important for public awareness. The database is managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nBitcoin's vulnerability listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) System. Source: CVE Records.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network vulnerability is currently under analysis. As one potential impact, it could result in large amounts of non-transactional data spamming the blockchain, potentially increasing network size, and adversely affecting performance and fees.\n\nOn the NVD\u2019s website, a recent post from Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr on X (formerly Twitter) is featured as an information resource. Dashjr alleges that inscriptions exploit a Bitcoin Core vulnerability to spam the network. \"I guess it\u2019s like receiving junk mail that you have to sift through everyday to find the ones that are your contacts. It slows down the process,\u201d a user wrote in the discussion.\n\nWhy is it relevant to Ordinals?\n\nAn inscription consists of embedding additional data to a specific satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin). This data can be anything digital, like an image, text, or other forms of media. Each time data is added onto a satoshi, it becomes a permanent part of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEven though data embedding has been part of the Bitcoin protocol for some time, its popularity only increased with the advent of Ordinals in late 2022, a protocol that allowed unique digital arts to be directly embedded into Bitcoin transactions, similar to how nonfungible tokens (NFTs) run on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe volume of Ordinals transactions clogged Bitcoin\u2019s network several times during 2023, resulting in more competition to confirm transactions, thus increasing fees and slowing processing time.\n\nIf the bug is patched, it can potentially restrict Ordinals inscriptions on the network. Asked if Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens \u201cwould stop being a thing\u201d if the vulnerability was fixed, Dashjr replied, \"Correct.\" However, existing inscriptions would remain intact due to the immutability of the network.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nOver $400 million worth of positions liquidated in the last 24 hours across BTC and ETH.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum decreased by 11% as key resistance was reached.\n\nA Bull market correction might have started.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin reached $45,000 on December 5 and stayed there until yesterday, December 10, when it made a downturn. It fell to $40,335 at its lowest point as the week began, marking a decrease of 11%. On the other hand, Ethereum made its yearly high of $2,400 on December 9 after a downturn to $2,145, which is an 11% decrease as well.\n\nConsequently, we saw a larger amount of long positions getting liquidated. According to CoinGlass data, in the past 24 hours, 113,881 traders were liquidated, and the total liquidations came in at $403.96 million.\n\nMost were long positions with $348.62 million compared to only $55.52 million. With the prices getting overextended in the previous period and now seeing significant declines, is this an early sign of market weakness?\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Bitcoin rose by 76% since its September 11 low of around $25,000. This is the start of the ending wave from the larger uptrend that started on November 21 last year.\n\nIn our previous analysis, we called for an interaction with the $45,000 area as the next significant resistance, and judging by today\u2019s rejection, it has proven to serve as such. Analyzing the wave structure in the last advancement from November 6, it seems there might be another minor attempt to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nIt came slightly short from the interaction with the level, so an upward spike above it would look likely, but it ended as a wick and quickly snapped back below it. The rise ended as it is, and now the first bull phase correction has started.\n\nIn any case, this correction will be awaited shortly, and from the current downward movement, we will see if it has already begun. This ABC correction should bring the price of Bitcoin to the $25,000 area optimally but could go lower.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nWhat\u2019s been said for Bitcoin applies to Ethereum as well. Its price was in an ascending structure from June 18 last year and most likely marked the completion of the leading diagonal, moving upward in a five-wave manner.\n\nDecember 9 high was an interaction with its ascending resistance level and ended as a rejection, displaying the same behavior as it did on two previous occasions. There could be another minor high ahead, but this chance is slim.\n\nMore likely, we saw the completion of this larger uptrend, and it is now headed to its first bull-significant correction. If so, ETH could now be sent to the $1,500 area in an ABC correction or to $1,400 if it reaches its optimal Fibonacci retracement level of 0.618.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has continuously grown since November last year and recovered significantly, showing promising signs of a starting bull market. However, before it can continue sustainably, it must establish higher support and form its first higher low.\n\nThese higher lows are the corrections we have outlined in our price chart analysis and are referred to as higher price points compared to the lows of November last year when the larger uptrend started.\n\nAs the prices are getting overextended and we are approaching the holiday season, the euphoria might cause the market to continue or attempt to rise for another push, but these corrections are imminent.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

This is after the market already saw $330 million in crypto futures contracts liquidated on Monday morning as BTC fell below $43,000. Total liquidations have now reached $516 million, according to CoinGlass.\n\nStill, the 1-day dip is relative. It's still 5% higher than it was at the start of the month, when BTC was changing hands for $38,688. The same can be said of Ethereum, which has lost 7% since yesterday and is currently trading for $2,185. That's 7% higher than what it started the month at, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization, which has hovered around $1 trillion for the better part of the year, now sits at $1.6 trillion\u2014down 6% since yesterday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, alts were taking a beating. ORDI (ORDI), which last week saw explosive growth and set an all-time high of $68.37, has slumped 14% in the past day. The token, easily the most popular BRC-20 token built on Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinals protocol, is now trading for $45.11.\n\nPepecoin (PEPE), which last week jumped 26% during a spike in meme coin activity, has also cooled off. As of this writing, it has fallen 13% in the last day and is trading for $0.00000138.\n\nEven as the some of the largest digital assets by market cap take a hit, there's been good news for some alts.\n\nA new report from digital asset manager CoinShares finds that institutional investors have been especially keen on Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX).

As of this writing, BUSD had dropped as low as $0.97, according to CoinGecko. Even though it's a defunct stablecoin, there are still roughly 1.4 billion of the tokens in circulation.\n\nOne possible reason for the price turbulence: Most BUSD margin trading and futures contracts were automatically closed today, according to a Binance blog post.\n\nBUSD has been on a steady decline since the SEC sent a Wells Notice to New York-based firm Paxos, which used to handle minting and redemptions of BUSD on behalf of crypto exchange Binance. In the aftermath, Paxos and Binance said that users could continue to redeem their tokens until February 2024.\n\nThe exchange said BUSD tokens that aren't redeemed before Binance stops support will automatically be converted to FDUSD, a stablecoin issued by FD121 Ltd.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Bitcoin vs gold: Which one is a better investment option? - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the universe of investments, the age-old debate between investing in traditional assets and emerging digital alternatives has gained momentum especially when discussing which one is preferred.The landscape of investments over the last few decades has witnessed a transformative shift with the rise of digital currencies, and among them, Bitcoin stands out as a beacon of innovation and opportunity.Among the contenders, Bitcoin has emerged as a frontrunner, challenging the historical dominance and status quo of gold as the ultimate store of value.One of the key reasons investors are drawn to both gold and Bitcoin is their finite supply. Gold's scarcity has been the primary driving factor behind its historical value, but Bitcoin takes this concept to the next level.Built on a protocol that caps its supply at 21 million coins, Bitcoin introduces an unyielding element of scarcity that outshines gold. Operating on a decentralized network, Bitcoin is free from the influence of any government or central authority. This decentralization ensures that no single entity can manipulate the currency , making it a more robust store of value when compared to gold, which is subject to geopolitical and economic pressures.In today\u2019s age of digitalization, the physical constraints of investing in physical gold especially when it comes to transporting and dividing gold make it complicated and expensive, limiting its utility for day-to-day transactions.Bitcoin, being entirely digital, transcends these limitations allowing for seamless, instantaneous transactions across borders, making it a more practical and efficient medium of exchange. Moreover, Bitcoin's divisibility into smaller units, known as satoshis, enhances its usability for microtransactions, a feat unattainable with physical gold. Also, the underlying blockchain technology offers a level of transparency that gold transactions lack.Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public ledger, accessible to anyone interested. This transparency reduces the risk of fraud and ensures the integrity of the entire network. Furthermore, the security features embedded in Bitcoin's cryptographic framework make it highly resistant to hacking and fraud, providing investors with a robust layer of protection that physical gold may lack.It is also important to remember that Bitcoin provides financial inclusion to individuals who may not have access to the traditional banking systems or the ability or the financial wherewithal to purchase gold. However, with a smartphone and an internet connection, anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network, fostering a more inclusive global financial system.To extract value from both gold and Bitcoin, a form of \u2018mining\u2019 is involved. When it comes to Gold, a tangible and physical asset extracted from the earth, its enduring appeal makes it a sought-after commodity for both jewellery and investment. Investing in the metal makes it a reliable asset for hedging against inflation and diversifying investment portfolios.However, the actual mining of gold for investment purposes is resource-intensive, requiring substantial energy and water consumption. This contributes to the industry's carbon footprint and raises concerns about sustainability.Bitcoin on the other hand is a digital asset that has introduced a new form of mining of cryptographic tokens. Operating on a decentralized network, the process of mining Bitcoin contributes to the security and integrity of the blockchain. This decentralized nature eliminates the need for central authorities, providing a level playing field for participants, allowing individuals from various corners of the world to participate.This inclusivity promotes financial accessibility, especially in regions with limited access to traditional banking systems. Despite all the inherent advantages, mining of Bitcoin also poses significant challenges.Bitcoin mining, particularly Proof of Work (PoW) methods, has faced criticism for its energy-intensive nature where large scale mining farms, often powered by fossil fuels, contribute to environmental concerns and carbon emissions. This process also requires specialized hardware and technical expertise, thereby creating barriers to entry for individuals without the necessary resources or technical know-how.Gold mining and Bitcoin mining represent two distinct approaches to resource extraction, each with its own set of advantages and challenges. While gold carries the weight of history, stability, and tangible appeal, Bitcoin introduces decentralization, global accessibility, and limited supply to the mining landscape.Investing in gold often requires substantial capital, and the costs associated with storage and insurance can be extremely discouraging to investors.Bitcoin, on the other hand, is more accessible to a broader spectrum of investors. Its divisibility allows for fractional ownership, enabling individuals to start with smaller amounts and gradually increase their holdings.Moreover, Bitcoin provides financial inclusion and goes a long way in bridging gaps in the global financial landscape. With a smartphone and an internet connection, anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network, democratizing finance in ways gold never could.In the clash between Bitcoin and gold, it's no longer merely a debate over two assets but a reflection of the ongoing transformation in the world of finance.The ongoing saga of investment choices has seen Bitcoin emerge as a revolutionary force, challenging the conventional wisdom that has surrounded gold for centuries. Its combination of finite supply, decentralization, digital efficiency, transparency, and global accessibility positions it as a compelling alternative for the modern investor. As we navigate through an increasingly interconnected and digitized world, the attributes that set Bitcoin apart\u2014scarcity, decentralization, and digital efficiency\u2014signal a paradigm shift in how we perceive and store value.However, it is advised that like with any investment decision, investors need to be discerning, do their due diligence before coming to a decision of investing in either Bitcoin or gold. With the passage of time as the digital revolution unfolds, the choice between Bitcoin and gold becomes not just a financial decision but a strategic positioning in the evolving landscape of global wealth.(The author Roshan Aslam is Co-founder and CEO of GoSats.

A high was formed near $44,699 and the price started a sharp downside correction. There was a move below the $44,000 level. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $43,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nThe pair declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $39,398 swing low to the $44,699 high. Bitcoin is now trading below $43,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.\n\nHowever, the bulls are protecting the $40,000 support and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $39,398 swing low to the $44,699 high. The price is attempting a recovery wave and facing resistance near the $42,400 level.\n\nSource: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe first major resistance is forming near $43,2000, above which the price might gain bullish momentum and rise toward $44,000. A close above the $44,000 resistance might start a strong upward move. The next key resistance could be near $44,200, above which BTC could rise toward the $45,000 level.\n\n$40K Is The Key For BTC\n\nIf Bitcoin fails to rise above the $43,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $41,200 level.\n\nThe next major support is near $40,500, below which the price might test the $40,000 zone. If there is a move below $40,000, there is a risk of more downsides. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $38,500 support in the near term.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 30 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $41,200, followed by $40,000.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $42,400, $43,200, and $44,200.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Karnataka Bitcoin scam: Police probe if hacker Sriki had access to electronic devices while in custody - The Indian Express",
        "content": "A special investigation team of the Karnataka police probing a Bitcoin scam involving alleged corruption by police officers and politicians is looking at whether international hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, arrested in 2020, had access to electronic devices while in prison.\n\nThe SIT is looking at whether Sriki (31) transferred cryptocurrency that was in his possession to bribe police officials and others while in police custody for nearly 82 days and subsequently while in judicial custody, as he has claimed. He was arrested by the Bengaluru crime branch police.\n\nThe Bitcoin scam involving Sriki and his associates has been at the centre of a political controversy in Karnataka with the Congress alleging that top leaders of the BJP, which was in power at the time of the hacker\u2019s arrest, and police officials had received kickbacks in cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SIT, created under the Criminal Investigation Department after the Congress government came to power, is looking for devices said to have been accessed by the hacker following his arrest and detention in police and judicial custody, sources said.\n\nThe SIT has also sought cancellation of bail granted earlier to the hacker and his associates in order to facilitate investigations including verification of the hacker\u2019s claims of having transferred cryptocurrency to police officials. The court is yet to arrive at a decision on the SIT plea.\n\n\u201cHe was in police custody for nearly 82 days after arrest. There were allegations that he was in possession of stolen cryptocurrency, but nothing was recovered in the police cases. These aspects are being investigated,\u201d a police source said.\n\nAs part of efforts to understand the hacker\u2019s association with cryptocurrency, the SIT has interviewed some of his past associates, including those who were at the centre of a criminal case filed against him in 2018. The case involving the son of a politician was believed to have emerged out of a dispute linked to cryptocurrency but was portrayed as arising from other reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn statements given to the police in the past, the hacker has claimed that he gave away Bitcoins that were in his possession to the police following his arrest in 2020. \u201cI understood the case scenario that even if I do not give them the Bitcoins they can use forensic methods to find the Bitcoins after a talk with the investigating officer. So post consultations I voluntarily accepted [sic] to give away the Bitcoins which I had kept in various wallets in different cryptocurrencies,\u201d reads a statement attributed to Sriki which is part of the chargesheet in one of the cases filed against him in 2021.\n\n\u201cEarlier when the BJP was in power, a Bitcoin scam running into lakhs of rupees is reported to have occurred through virtual transfers with several people involved in the transactions and the issue was hushed up without proper investigations,\u201d Home Minister G Parameshwara said while announcing new investigations in the hacker\u2019s cases in June.\n\nThe Congress has suggested in the past that there could be links between the release of Sriki from prison in April 2021 and the movement of Bitcoins stolen from the Bitfinex exchange in August 2016, in which the hacker has claimed involvement.\n\nBlockchain analysts reported on social media on April 14, 2021, that nearly 12,000 Bitcoins out of the 1,19,754 stolen during the Bitfinex heist had moved for the first time in over four years. Sriki was in the Bengaluru central prison when the stolen Bitcoins were moved. He was released on bail a few days later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe claim made on Whale Alert (a social media account tracking bitcoin movements) that 14,682 stolen Bitfinex bitcoins were transferred is completely unsubstantiated. There is nothing to suggest that it originated from Bangalore,\u201d the Bengaluru police said in a statement on November 12, 2021."

        "content": "BITCOIN delivered another bout of its notorious volatility in a sharp tumble towards US$40,000 amid a broader crypto sell-off.\n\nThe largest token sank as much as 7.5 per cent to US$40,521 before paring some of the losses to trade 4 per cent lower at US$42,095 as at 11.12 am in Singapore on Monday (Dec 11).\n\nSmaller tokens such as Ether, XRP, Polkadot and Avalanche also fell. A gauge of the largest 100 digital assets shed about 4 per cent, the largest drop since Nov 22.\n\nBitcoin has been on a tear this year on expectations that regulators will allow the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, widening the potential base of crypto investors. Bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year also encouraged a rally in virtual currencies.\n\n\u201cMarket leverage had risen materially,\u201d said Sydney-based Richard Galvin, co-founder at Digital Asset Capital Management. \u201cThe current fall looks like a market deleveraging as opposed to any fundamental news catalyst.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also braced this week for US inflation data and the Fed\u2019s final policy meeting of 2023, both of which could test aggressive wagers on rate cuts.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU Monday, 3.30 PM Garage The hottest news on all things startup and tech to kickstart your week.

He expects falls towards the US$40,000 to US$37,500 range to be \u201cwell-supported\u201d by dip buyers.\n\nBitcoin has jumped more than 150 per cent this year, energising a wider digital-asset recovery from last year\u2019s rout. But the token remains well below its 2021 pandemic-era record high of nearly US$69,000. BLOOMBERG"
