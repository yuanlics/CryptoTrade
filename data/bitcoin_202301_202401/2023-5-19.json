        "content": "Bitcoin is the first and largest cryptocurrency network. Launched in early 2009 by someone, or a team of people, under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, it lit the torch of a volatile crypto market that at its peak commanded close to $3 trillion. Bitcoin is the name of both the cryptocurrency, also known as BTC, and the blockchain\u2014the ledger that powers the coin.\n\nBTC is basically digital money. The Bitcoin blockchain is public, and anyone can interact with it to send BTC to other Bitcoin wallets, the network\u2019s equivalent of bank accounts, or speculate on its price while trading on exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. Transactions typically cost a few dollars and take about 10 minutes to process, so a lot of people have taken to calling the coin \u201cdigital gold\u201d rather than the \u201celectronic cash\u201d proposed in Nakamoto\u2019s 2008 white paper.\n\nTo process transactions, computers engage in a process called proof of work, whereby the first computer to solve a math puzzle wins the right to add another block to Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger. As a reward, these computers receive newly minted BTC.\n\nThe main concept that distinguishes Bitcoin from the traditional financial system is decentralization. Instead of running digital payment transfers through big data centers, like Mastercard or Visa, the Bitcoin protocol incentivizes individuals to use their computers to process transactions and maintain the ledger. And instead of having a central bank pull the levers of monetary policy, Nakamoto enshrined Bitcoin\u2019s issuance schedule within its code. As of early 2023, the vast majority of the total supply of Bitcoins\u2014more than 19 million\u2014have already been issued or \u201cmined\u201d while the remaining amount will be issued in ever slower allotments until the year 2140. By that time, all 21 million Bitcoins will have been issued.\n\nNakamoto disappeared about two years after launching the network, and so today updates to its open-source code are implemented by a core community of maintainers. If a group of people doesn\u2019t like how the project is going, they can \u201cfork\u201d the network with the support of miners to start their own rival blockchain.\n\nSome major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, are forks of Bitcoin. Yet Bitcoin remains by far the most valuable cryptocurrency; when BTC hit its all-time high market cap of $1.23 trillion in November 2021, it commanded 71% of the market.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nBitcoin Core landing page\n\nBitcoin white paper\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat Is Ethereum?\n\nCrypto investing 101\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nBitcoin explorer"

        "title": "A husband hid $500,000 in bitcoin during a divorce \u2014 and got busted by a crypto hunter - CNBC",
        "content": "watch now\n\nA few months into her divorce proceedings, Sarita thought it was suspicious that her spouse, who earned $3 million annually, didn't have many assets. After spending half a year on discovery and enlisting the help of a forensic accountant, the New York housewife eventually tracked down 12 bitcoins \u2014 then worth half a million dollars \u2014 in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet. Sarita, who was married for a decade and asked to use a pseudonym to protect herself from retaliation, said she felt blindsided by her husband's cryptocurrency investment. \"I know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn't know much about it,\" Sarita said. \"It was never even a thought in my mind, because it's not like we were discussing it or making investments together. ... It was definitely a shock.\" The world of financial infidelity has become increasingly sophisticated, as investors \"hop\" coins across blockchains and sink their cash into metaverse properties. An NBC News poll found that 1 in 5 Americans have invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, with men between the ages of 18 and 49 accounting for the highest share of all demographic groups. CNBC spoke with divorce attorneys from Florida, New York, Texas and California, blockchain forensic investigators, financial advisors, as well as spouses who were either hunting down virtual coins or the crypto holders themselves. Most agree that the law can't keep up with all the new ways that people earn and safeguard digital assets that largely exist outside the reach of centralized intermediaries such as banks. Family and marital law attorney Kim Nutter said she first dove into the crypto vernacular in 2015 but that the state of Florida, where her practice is based, only recently inserted \"cryptocurrency\" into the standard request for production of documents \u2014 a key part of establishing the couple's marital property during the discovery process. \"I really still think the law is trying to catch up with this novel form of currency, even though it's been around for quite a while,\" Nutter said. \"What I find in litigation is because this is so new to all of us, even the most seasoned attorneys \u2014 unless you're really going out of your way to study this \u2014 educating the court, knowing what to ask for, and finding the right experts, it's much more of a scramble to me than other areas of law which had been around much longer,\" she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nHow crypto hunters track down coins\n\nHunting hidden crypto stashes in divorce has created an entirely new job category of forensic investigators. CNBC spoke with several of these crypto hunters, and they say that while the blockchain is a public ledger, some spouses have become very good at covering their financial tracks. \"If you have a spouse that's very tech savvy, and one that isn't, it can be somewhat easy to hide those assets,\" divorce attorney Kelly Burris told CNBC. \"The thing with cryptocurrency is it's not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can't subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody's cryptocurrency holdings,\" Burris said. She said she sees explicit cryptocurrency requests in discovery in 40% to 50% of her cases. The Austin, Texas-based attorney told CNBC that the ideal way to get information on a spouse's crypto holdings is to subpoena that information from a centralized crypto exchange. Otherwise, the process often involves a forensic analysis of their computer or phone to identify a wallet address and then a subsequent blockchain analysis. \"Crypto asset forensics, cryptocurrency forensics, and blockchain forensics have become a significant part of our practice and by far, the fastest growing part of our practice,\" said Nick Himonidis, a New York-based forensic investigator. Himonidis, who is also a licensed private investigator and a computer forensic expert, estimates that 25% of his divorce-related cases involve some elements of cryptocurrency. Some of those cases, he said, are simple and straightforward \u2014 situations where, for example, a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin is a custodial asset held in a brokerage account or on a trading platform such as Coinbase . \"These companies keep records just like your broker at Morgan Stanley would keep records of your trades,\" he said. Other cases are what Himonidis describes as the \"whole enchilada.\" \"They're calling us because they want to get us appointed as the neutral forensic cryptocurrency expert to marshal and account for the party's crypto assets and track down any undisclosed crypto assets that one party may have,\" he said. When Himonidis first got into hunting crypto, it was all about bitcoin, ether and a handful of other coins. CoinMarketCap now lists more than 24,000 cryptocurrencies, with a collective market cap of $1.1 trillion. \"There's not just a couple of blockchains to worry about anymore. There's hundreds and hundreds of coins out there on their own little independent blockchains,\" he said. One of the core tenets of bitcoin is that its public ledger, which stores all token transactions in its history, is visible to everyone. But there is a subset of cryptocurrencies known as privacy tokens, which have anonymity features built into them. Coins such as monero, dash and zcash, which operate on their own blockchains, disguise practically all transaction details, including the identity of the sender and recipient, as well as the transaction amount. Himonidis said it is \"virtually impossible\" to trace and de-anonymize transactions in monero. In one case, Himonidis found around $700,000 worth of monero on a MacBook that turned up in discovery. \"We found something called a command line wallet for monero,\" Himonidis said, describing it as a kind of software wallet. \"You can't find it with the Finder on the Mac. You need to go into a command line prompt to access this wallet \u2014 a Bash shell command on a Mac environment.\" Multiple investigators and attorneys told CNBC that they are always on the lookout for any type of crypto \u2014 but particularly privacy tokens. There is also special attention paid to any kind of hardware wallet or computing device, which can double as a form of \"cold storage\" for cryptocurrencies. People who hold their own cryptocurrency can store it \"hot,\" \"cold\" or some combination of the two. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and allows owners relatively easy access to their coins so they can spend their crypto. The trade-off for convenience is potential exposure to bad actors \u2014 and forensic investigators working for divorce attorneys.\n\nA person holds a cryptocurrency hardware wallet. Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt | AFP | Getty Images\n\nWith cold storage, the private keys \u2014 or the passwords that enable the crypto to be moved out of the wallet \u2014 are stored on devices, such as computers, that are not connected to the internet. Thumb drive-size devices, such as a Trezor or Ledger, offer another way to secure crypto tokens cold by safeguarding both the crypto itself and the keys to access it. Mark DiMichael, who has been in the forensic accounting field for more than 14 years and is a certified cryptocurrency forensic investigator, described one case to CNBC in which a divorcing couple had a stand-off over a password-protected Ledger device. In the case, DiMichael said, the husband had a Ledger and then the wife found the device in the house and took it. \"So the wife had the Ledger, but she didn't know the pin number, or password. And the husband \u2014 he knew the pin number, but he didn't have the Ledger.\" Neither could access the funds without the cooperation of the other. DiMichael, who said he has tracked down millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency since he began tracing digital assets in 2018, explained that when crypto is stored cold, it may be more difficult to seize but it is still traceable. \"If they're doing on-chain transactions and they move something to cold storage, it's still visible on the blockchain,\" he said. DiMichael told CNBC that in a divorce case if you can at least prove that the crypto is there \u2014 or that it hasn't been sold \u2014 that's usually sufficient for a judge. If a spouse bought 100 bitcoins on Coinbase , for example, and later transferred the currency off an exchange to a wallet, it's still sitting there and fully visible on the blockchain. A court can then order other remedies to retrieve those funds, according to DiMichael. New York divorce attorney Sandra Radna told CNBC that right at the beginning of a case, when she serves the summons and complaint for a divorce, she also asks for a preservation of assets \u2014 known as the \"automatic orders\" in New York. At this point, Radna said, she singles out computer hard drives in her request, to ensure that nothing will be destroyed. This is key since these devices are what the forensic investigator uses to determine where the assets \u2014 both crypto and otherwise \u2014 went. \"They go through the hard drive of the computer to look for ticker symbols within emails, which is how they can see what purchases were made,\" Radna said. Radna said she also asks for information such as a spouse's \"public keys,\" which she described as being almost like an account number on the blockchain. Currently, much of the world runs on something called asymmetric cryptography, in which individuals use a private and public key pair to access things such as email and crypto wallets. A private key is a secure code that grants the owner access to their crypto holdings \u2014 whereas the public key is a unique wallet address. With the public key, it is possible to find a full history of every transaction made into or out of that wallet. \"If you have that information, you will be able to see every transaction that they did, and it's something that the attorneys are able to get as part of discovery because it's not giving a private number, a private key,\" Radna said. Bill Callahan of the Blockchain Intelligence Group said that with that wallet address, crypto hunters are able to tell the attorney or the attorney's investigator that they should go to a specific exchange to request more information. \"One of the things we're looking for are the on- and off-ramps. We're looking to see how the money came on to the blockchain, where it may be, and then where it's off to,\" Callahan said. He said the flow of funds can also show whether something was purposely hidden through an obfuscation technique such as using a crypto asset mixer. These so-called mixers are designed to obscure trails of funds by blending someone's tokens with a pool of other individuals' assets on the platform. They go beyond traditional crypto platforms in further concealing the identity of the people involved in transactions. \"We can kind of track and trace the flow after the proceedings are over to see if something was purposely hidden,\" Callahan said. \"The blockchain never forgets.\" In one case, Himonidis said, he had to track around $2.3 million that was emptied out of a Coinbase account within a few months of divorce proceedings commencing. The crypto coins hadn't been cashed out to fiat but instead moved as crypto to addresses outside Coinbase in a series of approximately 14 outbound transfers. \"All of it wound up in two or three different wallets on a foreign exchange \u2014 a place like Coinbase, but in a foreign country that does not operate in the U.S. and is not subject to the laws and jurisdiction in the United States,\" Himonidis told CNBC. DiMichael said he has run into similar issues with cases where funds were transferred to a global Binance account, and he was, therefore, unable to subpoena records since the funds were in an untouchable jurisdiction. Tracking assets gets especially complicated when investors begin to move their tokens across blockchains. DiMichael said \"chain hopping\" \u2014 a person switching from one blockchain to another very quickly \u2014 is an increasingly common technique used to throw off investigators. Blockchains have their own native tokens. With ethereum, for example, the token is ether. Developers have built cross-chain bridges to let users send tokens from one chain to another. Transfers of digital assets between chains has helped to expand the crypto market by giving people more ways to pay and transact. Cross-chain bridges are vital to the development of the decentralized finance, or DeFi, space, which is crypto's alternative to the banking system. But in a divorce case these bridges make it difficult for investigators to follow the trail of tokens. Take the crypto token polka dot, which is trading at around $5.40 and has a market valuation of over $6.3 billion. Because the virtual coin is on its own blockchain, when someone wants to trade it they need to \"wrap it\" in order to buy and sell it on the ethereum blockchain, Himonidis told CNBC. Wrapped tokens are pegged to the value of the original coin but are interoperable with other blockchains. \"If we need to start tracing stuff like that, it gets very complicated,\" said Himonidis. \"When they do coin swaps, now we're jumping \u2014 literally jumping \u2014 blockchains, trying to trace the funds. It was complicated enough before, and now, it's gotten exponentially more complicated in just the last year or two.\" Himonidis said he and his firm are able to follow funds across blockchains using a tool previously only available to law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service, and financial institutions that need it for their know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering functions. But even with new search tools, Himonidis described his work as a literal race to try to keep up with the latest in rapidly evolving crypto tech. \"It lends itself very well to people who have figured out how it works and understand what's going on there,\" said Himonidis. \"It's this constant arms race.\" DiMichael agrees, telling CNBC it was \"inevitable\" that these kinds of obfuscation techniques would crop up given the amount of money in the crypto ecosystem now, even in the midst of a down market. \"But it is still coming as a total shock to the so-called non-monied spouses,\" DiMichael said. Many centralized exchanges such as Gemini offer customers the option to stake their tokens in order to earn yield on their digital assets that would otherwise sit idle on the platform. With crypto staking, investors typically vault their crypto assets with a blockchain validator, which verifies the accuracy of transactions on the blockchain. Investors can receive additional crypto tokens as a reward for locking away those assets. In one of his divorce cases, DiMichael said, the husband disclosed the cryptocurrencies he owned, but he didn't disclose the tokens that were staked. \"The ones that he staked, he wasn't really counting those in his numbers, so I uncovered that through the investigative process,\" DiMichael said. \"Even though this cryptocurrency wasn't in his wallet anymore, he still had rights to it.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nValuing crypto property in divorce court\n\nEven when both parties in a divorce are totally above board on discovery, volatility in the crypto market can prove to be a major issue when attorneys try to value a marital estate. NodeBaron, a 36-year-old vascular surgical engineer and veteran who asked to be identified by his Twitter username, said he liquidated his stake in dogecoin for around $5,000 during his divorce. Six months later, his holdings would have been worth close to $1 million. \"The cost to get a divorce was almost like a million-dollar decision,\" he said. Divorce attorney Alexandra Mussallem said that because California, where her practice is based, is a community-property state, she often advises her clients on whether to stay in a particular asset \u2014 that is, to take half of a community asset in kind versus seeking a liquidated value. \"With volatile investments, the right strategy for a spouse trying to build a stable asset base will be to seek a cash buyout at market value on crypto holdings,\" said Mussallem, adding that it is a question of managing risk. The spouse with higher risk tolerance may be eager to cash out their partner and retain the crypto asset, given the heavy fluctuations in the crypto market, she said. Burris, the Texas-based attorney, said that in her first crypto case, around five years ago, the husband wanted to buy the wife out of his crypto holdings \u2014 which ultimately proved to be a good decision for him, given the rapid price appreciation in the crypto market since 2020. New York is an equitable distribution state, meaning that a spouse gets 50% of the marital assets accumulated during the marriage. Radna, the New York divorce attorney, told CNBC that digital assets can be taken in two ways. \"One way is to say, what is the value of that digital asset today, and we divide that up,\" she said, calling the process analogous to stocks. \"You can either take the shares of stock, or you can take the value of that.\" In an up market, Radna said, spouses typically opt for taking the value of the crypto holdings.\n\nwatch now\n\nValuing and dividing a marital estate can become especially problematic when spouses diversify their crypto portfolio into metaverse properties and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Despite the NFT market collectively losing nearly $2 trillion since its peak in 2021, blue-chip series such as Bored Ape Yacht Club still have a floor price of more than $80,000. \"You have digital land as NFTs, you have digital artwork as NFTs, you have digital metaverse clothing in NFTs,\" said DiMichael, adding that one of his clients had sold $80 million worth of NFTs. DiMichael, who first spoke with CNBC in 2022, said that if a spouse has a couple of NFTs from a collection like the Bored Ape Yacht Club or Crypto Punks, it could add a couple hundred thousand dollars to the marital estate. \"NFTs are really driving me nuts. How do I find the real expert to value the NFT, which is my obligation for a court of law?\" said Nutter, the Florida divorce attorney, referring to the Daubert standard, a rule that governs the admissibility of expert witness testimony in court. \"It requires more peer reviews, articles, a lot more science and community acceptance, which is challenging when you have something particularly like an NFT.\" \"NFTs are kind of new, and people know what they are, but to find somebody who has the level of expertise that could satisfy a court Daubert challenge and questioning I think is problematic for pretty much everybody,\" she said. \"Doesn't matter what side of the coin you're on.\" Radna, who mostly handles litigated divorces and has been practicing for 30 years, said she specifically looks for digital real estate assets in the metaverse when she requests discovery. \"You think it's not real, but they make real income from it,\" said Radna. \"They can get paid for someone to rent that digital real estate where they can have advertising and a billboard, but it would be in the metaverse.\" If a spouse owns digital real estate and they're getting rent for it, that would be income and counted in the divorce, according to Radna, who said 20% of her caseload has involved crypto in the last few years. \"It's a whole new world, and people should be aware of it,\" she added. Certified financial planner and analyst Davon Barrett told CNBC that with a traditional asset class, he can just give a divorce agreement to Fidelity, for example, and the company will take care of the split on its own. \"But with cryptocurrency, it's a newer space,\" said Barrett, the lead advisor at Francis Financial in New York. \"It's harder to get customer service on the phone at times, so splitting it becomes a little bit more difficult.\" The tax implications are another major consideration when choosing how to divide crypto assets. The IRS treats cryptocurrencies like property, meaning that each time you spend, exchange or sell your tokens, you're logging a taxable event. There's always a difference between how much you paid for your crypto, which is the cost basis, and the market value at the time you spend it. That difference can trigger capital gains taxes. \"There are people who bought bitcoin years ago, so their cost basis was $10,000,\" Barrett said. He gave a hypothetical where a client would potentially be smarter to keep $500,000 in cash, versus bitcoin, so that their spouse is the one stuck with the gains. \"The government, they may not have gotten it in the past, but Uncle Sam is really good about getting his money,\" Barrett said. \"I think that you have your head in the sand if you don't think that this is something that's here to stay, even if during a down market,\" Radna said. \"Like any other asset, just like the stock market, there's going to be ups and downs. I think the people that are interested in digital assets are going to continue to be interested in digital assets,\" she said. \"When it's a down market, that's when you go shopping.\""

        "content": "Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is betting big on digital currency Bitcoin for campaign donations, and he's also unveiling a new proposal to roll back tax restrictions on mining the currency in the U.S.\n\n\"The thriving Bitcoin universe should actually better empower me to do what I want to do as the U.S. president, which is to stabilize the U.S. dollar as a unit of measurement and put the Federal Reserve back in its place with that as its single mandate,\" Ramaswamy said in an exclusive interview with CBS News. (He would dispense with the Fed's dual mandate of stabilizing currency and maximum employment to have it focus on the former.)\n\nRamaswamy plans to debut his new Bitcoin policy this Saturday at the annual Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami.\n\nThe business entrepreneur won't be the first presidential candidate to allow digital currency for donations to his campaign. That distinction belongs to Sen. Rand Paul, who accepted Bitcoin donations in his 2016 White House campaign.\n\nPresident Biden, Senator Tim Scott, former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Former President Donald Trump are not accepting cryptocurrency donations. However, Trump, who is leading in Republican primary polls, did issue non-fungible tokens \u2014 commonly known as NFTs \u2014 last fall and reportedly personally earned up to $1 million from selling the unique digital assets.\n\nRamaswamy has no plans to unveil his own NFTs for personal profit or his campaign.\n\n\"Right now, I'm more focused on policy. It also just gives people the choice to donate to the campaign in Bitcoin and signal that we're not threatened by it,\" he said.\n\nA core tenet of Ramaswamy's proposal would be the freedom to mine Bitcoin in the U.S.\n\nHarvesting the digital currency is a costly, energy-draining process. The U.S. recently eclipsed China as the premier location for harvesting the digital coin after Beijing in 2021 pushed out companies mining the digital currency to cut energy consumption.\n\nThe Biden administration recently proposed a 30% tax on electricity used by cryptocurrency mining operations in its budget for the fiscal year of 2024.\n\n\"I think that it's wrong and unfair and is not an appropriate use of federal power,\" Ramaswamy said. But there is little chance that Congress would pass a new tax on electricity consumed by cryptocurrency mining, especially since the House is controlled by Republicans.\n\nThe entrepreneur said the freedom to mine would be the \"base principle that it is unfair and counterproductive to target Bitcoin miners as different from any other consumer of energy, period.\"\n\n\"We'll put that into the rules and preserve freedom to mine by rescinding and committing against any special taxes for the utilization of energy for purposes of mining,\" he said.\n\nRamaswamy's proposal would also codify that Bitcoin and similar coins would not be treated as a security, which he says would allow it to be \"a parallel currency.\" Bitcoin has skyrocketed in value within the last decade, but remains highly volatile due to uncertainty in the cryptocurrency markets and government regulation.\n\nNonetheless, he argues cryptocurrency can provide an alternative to Americans wary about the strength of the U.S. dollar.\n\n\"The insecurities that the defenders of fiat money have with respect to the rise of Bitcoin is similar to the insecurities that I see amongst public schools and the teachers unions and the administrators of public schools with respect to school choice,\" Ramaswamy said. \"I will be the opposite of what public schools are to school choice.\"\n\nThe state of cryptocurrency in the U.S.\n\nWashington is pushing for greater regulation and oversight of cryptocurrencies after the collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency hedge fund and crypto-exchange site, in November 2022. Shortly after, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged with securities fraud, money laundering and campaign finance violations.\n\nThe cryptocurrency company lost about $9 billion of customer funds. A string of other industry players have declared bankruptcy over the last year, including BlockFi, Celsius Network, Genesis Global Capital, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital.\n\nGary Gensler, the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, testified before Congress in April about the state of the cryptocurrency market and clashed with Republicans over a proposed requirement that companies disclose information related to climate-related risks and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has fluctuated wildly in recent years, but is currently a $1.7 trillion industry. Bitcoin has the largest share of that market, with about $518 billion in securities."

He told the woman that her bank account had two fraudulent deposits of $15,000 and $23,000, which he advised needed to be taken to the nearest Bitcoin Depot ATM, a machine that takes cash deposits and purchases the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin before transferring it, untraceably, to an anonymous \u201cdigital wallet.\u201d\n\nThe woman withdrew $15,000 from her bank and deposited it at the Bitcoin Depot ATM at the Circle K at 11 N. College Ave. in Oxford.\n\nThe fake agent called her again the next day, advising her to take $23,000 out of her account this time and deposit it into the Bitcoin Depot ATM for safekeeping. The woman\u2019s unspecified bank only allowed her to withdraw another $15,000. The woman told police that she felt uncomfortable with making the ATM deposit, so she took it to her home. But, as time wore on, she decided to make the deposit again.\n\nIn total, the woman deposited $30,000 into the Bitcoin Depot ATM after being advised under false pretenses. She\u2019s working with her bank to see what options are available to her.\n\nThe Journal-News spoke with a customer service representative at Bitcoin Depot who said there\u2019s no way to trace where the purchased Bitcoin went. Though the representative had no knowledge of this exact case, she said the only action the company can take in cases of fraud is to deactivate the victim\u2019s account and flag the digital wallet of the recipient to make sure no more Bitcoin can be transferred to that wallet. They can, however, return the ATM fee to the victim.\n\nBitcoin Depot has more than 7,000 ATMs across the country, including 11 in Butler County. The customer service representative said fraud occurs daily."

        "title": "Strike expands Bitcoin payments to 65 countries, moves global headquarters to El Salvador - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Since starting in 2019, the Bitcoin-powered payments app Strike has aimed to become a global crypto-powered equivalent to Venmo or Cash App. On Friday, the company\u2014led by 29-year-old entrepreneur Jack Mallers\u2014announced that it was expanding to a total of 65 global markets, in addition to the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina, where it already operates.\n\nMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home\n\nIn an interview with Fortune in Miami, Mallers touted Strike's consumer-facing app, which offers Bitcoin and Tether transfers, through what he described as a \"frictionless onboarding.\"\n\n\"We think there are billions of people that want a money app with those characteristics and capabilities contrasted to a clouded world of crypto exchanges and hidden, unregistered licensing regimes and 1,000 different coins,\" he said.\n\nAt a time when the U.S. crypto industry is confronting regulatory uncertainty, and as the Securities and Exchange Commission is suing firms for offering unregistered securities, Mallers said this is a validation of Strike's Bitcoin-first approach.\n\n\"I think Bitcoin stands alone, and just how obvious it is that it is owned by nobody,\" Mallers told Fortune. \"Every other instrument in this industry has a founding team, a foundation, and they issued some [tokens] privately and handed them out in auctions before they went live\u2014and that sounds a lot more like a security.\"\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has publicly stated that he views Bitcoin as a commodity not a security.\n\nMallers notes Strike has taken a regulation-first approach in the U.S., including in New York, where Strike is currently not available but in the process of applying for a so-called BitLicense.\n\nStory continues\n\nMallers added that Strike's expansion into other global markets came about partly as result of moving its global headquarters to El Salvador, which passed a digital assets law earlier this year establishing a regulatory framework for crypto. According to Mallers, Strike received one of the first licenses under the new regime, along with Bitfinex.\n\nMallers has ties to El Salvador and its president, Nayib Bukele, who established Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Mallers introduced Bukele at the Bitcoin Miami conference in 2021, where the president made the announcement by video.\n\nAlthough Strike was initially tapped to help develop El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment, it later retreated from the project, which suffered from early bugs and slow adoption.\n\nDespite reports that businesses and residents of El Salvador are not using Bitcoin, Mallers cited other metrics, like increased tourism. \"I do think that El Salvador found hope in Bitcoin,\" he said, arguing that merchant adoption \"wasn't what was defining success.\"\n\nThe next challenge for Strike will be to expand its ties to banking services that let customers exchange Bitcoin for fiat currency. Currently, customers in Strike's new markets will only be able to receive Bitcoin from other users, although Mallers said that he aims to launch new features, including a debit card, later this year. Another challenge comes in the form of network congestion and higher fees on Bitcoin transactions due to recent demand for new products like ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Mallers argued that \"Bitcoin is working as intended.\"\n\n\"The claims that [congestion] is hurting the third world, and it invalidates how emerging markets are using this technology is ridiculous,\" he said.\n\nMallers also pointed to another Strike feature\u2014Send Globally\u2014which allows users to transfer between USD and other currencies over Strike using Bitcoin as an intermediary, although it is limited to twelve countries in Africa, Central America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nCurrently, dollar balances in Strike are held in Tether, a dollar-pegged stablecoin that has drawn criticism for its shadowy accounting. Mallers said that the company decided to go with Tether, as opposed to other options like Circle and Coinbase's USD Coin, because of demand from users in the Global South.\n\n\"They don't trust Circle,\" he said. \"If I'm being totally honest, Circle is built for American institutions.\"\n\nAs advocates make the case that the Lightning network can actually transform Bitcoin into a payments service, Strike's expansion represents the first attempt to build an app that allows people across the world to transact with each other.\n\nMike Brock is the CEO of TBD, a Bitcoin-focused division of Jack Dorsey's financial technology company Block. Even as Block plots a global expansion for its payment platform Cash App, Brock was supportive of Strike's effort.\n\n\"If your mission is to advance any decentralized ecosystem, then you better hope that there's actually a pretty competitive marketplace of different companies vying for solutions within that system,\" he told Fortune.\n\nTwo years after Mallers introduced Bukele at Bitcoin Miami, he reflected on the changing circumstances, wearing a hat emblazoned with the El Salvador flag.\n\n\"Two years ago, people would have made fun of me [for our] headquarters in El Salvador to launch product for three billion people, but now Coinbase is fighting with Gary Gensler,\" he said. \"Who's laughing now?\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

Data from Glassnode shows an escalating pattern with regard to the amount of so-called Bitcoin \u201cwholecoiners.\u201d If the trend continues, Bitcoin price escalation could soon make buying it not only a luxury but something potentially unattainable altogether, according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin firm Blockstream. This hyperbitcoinization refers to the moment when the benefits of Bitcoin for financial transactions will eventually lead to the replacement of established financial institutions by a public-driven system, with Bitcoin becoming the world\u2019s default value system.\n\nFTX pursues $244M clawback from \u2018wildly inflated\u2019 Embed acquisition deal\n\nFTX\u2019s leadership is looking to claw back more than $240 million from insiders and executives that benefited from FTX\u2019s \u201cwildly inflated\u201d acquisition of stock-clearing platform Embed in September. According to court filings, Embed\u2019s own chief technology officer, Laurence Beal, was stunned that FTX paid so much for the company after one short meeting with its then-CEO, Michael Giles. Beal described FTX\u2019s due diligence process with a cowboy emoji. Lawyers accused FTX insiders of disproportionate payouts to Embed shareholders, including $55 million paid to its CEO.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. will be the first presidential candidate in United States history to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin, he announced during his first appearance as a presidential candidate at the Bitcoin 2023 conference. He praised the cryptocurrency as a \u201csymbol of democracy and freedom\u201d during the event. By having attended the Bitcoin event, RFK Jr. is not only targeting voters but also a potential source of millions of dollars in donations. The democratic candidate is incumbent President Joe Biden.\n\nVoyager bankruptcy plan approved, customers may recover 35.7% of claims initially\n\nVoyager\u2019s bankruptcy plan was approved on May 17 and its customers could now expect to receive 35.72% of their claims initially, either in crypto via the Voyager app or in cash, after 30 days. According to Voyager, it had $1.33 billion of assets for recovery as of May 8, of which $629.8 million was available for initial recovery, on claims of $1.8 billion. If FTX/Alameda Research\u2019s claim for preferential recovery is unsuccessful, creditors\u2019 initial recovery could increase. For that claim, Voyager is holding back $445 million. Voyager may also be able to recover funds from bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.\n\nCoin Cafe ordered to repay $4.3M in fees that \u2018wiped out\u2019 investors\u2019 Bitcoin accounts\n\nCryptocurrency trading platform Coin Cafe has been ordered to repay $4.3 million to its users after allegedly charging \u201cexorbitant and undisclosed fees\u201d for storing Bitcoin on the platform \u2014 leading to some accounts being drained entirely of their funds. One New York investor incurred fees exceeding $10,000 in a single month, while another investor was hit with fees amounting to $51,000 over a span of 13 months, said the office of the New York State Attorney General.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $26,889, Ether (ETH) at $1,813 and XRP at $0.46.

US debt deal to trigger $1T liquidity crunch, analyst warns\n\nBitcoin stares down potential losses heading into the third-quarter of 2023 as U.S. lawmakers will likely reach an agreement on raising the debt ceiling.\n\nRaising the debt ceiling means the U.S. Treasury could issue new bonds to raise cash to meet its previous obligations, draining liquidity from riskier assets like Bitcoin. Such macroeconomic hurdles could prevent Bitcoin from reclaiming its yearly highs of over $30,000 in the coming months, said pseudonymous independent market analyst Income Sharks.\n\n\u201cWe most likely range between 20k to 30k and even get an altseason,\u201d the analyst noted, adding that \u201cnew money isn\u2019t coming in; it\u2019s all just rotating.

Grayscale initially lodged a Form 10 application with the regulator to launch an updated Filecoin Trust product in April. This week, it received a letter from the SEC warning that FIL \u201cmeets the definition of a security\u201d under federal law and asked the firm to withdraw their application.\n\n\u2018Trusted\u2019 marketplace sold fake Trezor wallets stealing crypto \u2014 Kaspersky\n\nCybersecurity firm Kaspersky has reported an issue with fake hardware wallets impersonating major wallet firm Trezor. According to the Kaspersky team, attackers managed to access users\u2019 crypto assets by replacing the inner firmware. The fake Trezor wallet allowed fraudsters to steal Bitcoin via a replaced microcontroller, which enabled attackers to take control of the user\u2019s private keys. A standard set of wallet functions were provided by the fake wallet, which resembled a genuine Trezor Model T wallet.\n\n\u2018Inferno Drainer\u2019 scam as a service has stolen $5.9M since March\n\nA new scam as a service called \u201cInferno Drainer\u201d has reportedly stolen nearly $6 million from unsuspecting crypto users, according to Web3 scam-detecting firm Scam Sniffer.

So now the institutions and the proper portfolio managers \u2014 the people that are responsible for running diversified portfolios \u2014 are now starting to take a look at Bitcoin as a serious venue.\u201c\n\nIt is not just about maximizing profits, says Pye. For institutional investors, crypto use cases will be a growing trend in the next few years. \u201cThe theme for 2024 going forward is definitely use cases. So, we\u2019ve got this beautiful technology, now let\u2019s put that beautiful technology to work,\u201d he stated.\n\nRegulatory challenges for institutional adoption are nothing new, but Canada has taken the lead in launching crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s relatively negative stance toward crypto.\n\nRelated: Crypto adoption is booming, but not in the US or Europe \u2014 Bitcoin Builders 2023\n\nAn ETF is a portfolio of assets with shares traded on a stock market. It blends the characteristics and potential benefits of mutual funds, stocks and bonds.\n\nCanadian regulators have approved several crypto ETFs recently, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) products from 3iQ, Purpose Investments and Evolve Funds Group, attracting millions of dollars to the crypto products.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never been mispriced,\u201d said Pye about running regulated digital assets ETFs in Canada, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s no difference about running a Bitcoin ETF than running a gold ETF. We track the price of Bitcoin identically. They\u2019re low fees, and it works. [...] We can cipher trace where the Bitcoin comes from, so we\u2019re only purchasing clean Bitcoin. And I think these are all the characteristics that people are concerned about.\u201c\n\nCanada\u2019s latest initiative toward digital assets relies on public consultation about a central bank digital currency, with the local monetary authority asking what features the country\u2019s citizens want in a potential digital Canadian dollar.

        "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be the first presidential candidate in United States history to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin, he announced during his first appearance as a presidential candidate at the Bitcoin 2023 conference. He praised the cryptocurrency as a \u201csymbol of democracy and freedom\u201d during the event.\n\n\u201cToday, we show the world the power and the durability and the flexibility of Bitcoin. [...] Almost everyone in this room is aware of the link between Bitcoin and democracy and freedom. [...] They\u2019re passionate because of the deep representation of a deep need that we have for liberty and democracy and the promise that this innovation has to guarantee those virtues.\"\n\nRFK Jr. making the Bitcoin donation acceptance announcement at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami. Source: Sam Bourgi via Cointelegraph\n\nThe candidate \u2014 who is challenging President Joe Biden \u2014 has been sharing his libertarian views about cryptocurrencies on Twitter. In a post on May 3, RFK Jr. stated that \u201ccrypto technologies are a major innovation engine,\" adding that the U.S. is hobbling the industry and driving \u201cinnovation elsewhere.\"\n\nKennedy Jr. is the nephew of 35th President of the U.S. John F. Kennedy.\n\nBy attending the Bitcoin event, RFK Jr. is not only targeting voters but also a potential source of millions of dollars in donations. During last year\u2019s midterm elections, Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of now-bankrupted crypto exchange FTX, donated $40 million in support of candidates. Crypto exchange Coinbase has also been actively lobbying for legislation regulating the crypto space in the country.\n\nRFK Jr.\u2019s increased commitment to cryptocurrencies coincides with a tight regulatory environment in the U.S., spreading uncertainty among players and harming an already battered industry.\n\nThe candidate believes the U.S. economy could be more resilient if it has a diverse ecosystem of currencies:\n\n\u201cJust as a biodiverse ecosystem is a resilient ecosystem, so too will our economy be more resilient if it has a diverse ecology of currencies, not just a single, centrally controlled one. We are seeing today how fragile our over-centralized system is.\""

        "title": "We Asked ChatGPT If Ethereum\u2019s Price Can Flip Bitcoin in the Next 5 Years, Here\u2019s the Answer - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "A topic as old as time, if time was a few years old \u2013 will Ethereum flip Bitcoin in terms of total market cap? Will ETH overtake BTC?\n\nThis has been the \u201cto be or not to be\u201d in the cryptocurrency industry, and it pins communities against each other like no other. It\u2019s true that BTC has been the predominant market leader ever since it has been created, but a few years ago, who would have thought that another cryptocurrency would have a market cap worth over 40% of Bitcoin\u2019s? Well, that\u2019s the case for Ethereum today.\n\nSo, we decided to do what any sane person in 2023 would do \u2013 ask an AI language model what it (?) thinks. ChatGPT is all the rage in 2023, so who better to ask?\n\nCan Ethereum Flip Bitcoin?\n\nFirst things first, we prompted ChatGPT with this exact question: \u201cDo you think Ethereum\u2019s price can flip Bitcoin\u2019s price in the next 5 years?\u201d\n\nThe AI came back to us, explaining that this is an outcome that\u2019s \u201cuncertain and depends on various factors.\u201d\n\nThese include:\n\nAdoption Rates\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, Ethereum\u2019s robust ecosystem and use cases, such as DeFi, NFTs, and whatnot, could help it flip Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum\u2019s broader use cases, such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and smart contracts, could potentially drive wider adoption and thus increase its value relative to Bitcoin.\n\nHere\u2019s where it got kind of interesting. You see, ChatGPT\u2019s most recent knowledge cut-off on this topic was in September 2021. This means that it was before Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThat said, the second factor, according to the AI, is:\n\nNetwork Upgrades\n\nChatGPT argues that \u201cthe successful completion of Ethereum\u2019s planned upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0, could significantly affect its price. This upgrade plans to improve the scalability, security, and sustainability of Ethereum, which could increase its attractiveness to investors and users.\u201d\n\nWell, Ethereum\u2019s transition to proof-of-stake, otherwise known as \u201cThe Merge,\u201d is already a fact in our timeline, and so far, it hasn\u2019t really helped it get there.\n\nWhat Else Could Help ETH Flip BTC?\n\nThe flippening can also take place under a few more conditions, according to ChatGPT. Regulation, for once, is among the factors.\n\nChanges in cryptocurrency regulation could impact prices. More restrictive regulations could lower prices, while more accommodating ones could raise them.\n\nWhile it does sound like an answer from Captain Obvious, it is true. Favorable regulation could push ETH\u2019s price, but so far, the US government has taken a predatory approach, calling many of the projects built on Ethereum securities.\n\nGoing forward, the AI believes that market sentiment is also important. If enough investors believe Ethereum to be the better form of investment, it would inevitably lead to the flippening.\n\nLast but not least, the broader economic factors, including inflation, economic growth, and overall changes in the financial sector, could also have an impact.\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT took a more cautious position and didn\u2019t provide a straightforward yes or no answer. This was somewhat expected, but it what arguments would an AI use to structure a response to a question of this kind.\n\nOf course, none of the above should be construed as financial advice. The content is solely for educational and entertaining purposes, and we do hope you had fun with it."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) stares at potential losses heading into the third quarter of 2023 after United States lawmakers will likely reach an agreement on raising the debt ceiling.\n\nA $1 trillion liquidity hole ahead\n\nRaising the debt ceiling means the U.S. Treasury could issue new bonds to raise cash to meet its previous obligations.\n\nAs a result, the cash pile at the Treasury General Account could increase from $95 billion in May to $550 billion by June and to $600 billion in the three months afterward, according to the department's recent estimates.\n\nU.S. debt limit increases over the years. Source: Bloomberg\n\nAri Bergmann, the founder of risk management firm Penso Advisors, estimates that the Treasury will cross $1 trillion by the end of Q3, 2023.\n\n\u201cMy bigger concern is that when the debt-limit gets resolved \u2014 and I think it will \u2014 you are going to have a very, very deep and sudden drain of liquidity,\u201d said Bergmann, adding:\n\n\u201cThis is not something that\u2019s very obvious, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s very real. And we\u2019ve seen before that such a drop in liquidity really does negatively affect risk markets, such as equities and credit.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the cash available to buy riskier assets like stocks, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will all likely experience downward price pressure at some point after the debt ceiling is raised.\n\nBloomberg adds:\n\n\u201cEstimated at well over $1 trillion by the end of the third quarter, the supply burst would quickly drain liquidity from the banking sector, raise short-term funding rates and tighten the screws on the US economy just as it\u2019s on the cusp of recession. By Bank of America Corp.\u2019s estimate it would have the same economic impact as a quarter-point interest-rate hike.\u201d\n\nWill Bitcoin price remain rangebound?\n\nSuch macroeconomic hurdles could prevent Bitcoin from reclaiming its yearly highs of over $30,000 in the coming months, says independent market analyst Income Sharks.\n\n\"We most likely range between 20k to 30k and even get an altseason,\" the analyst noted, adding:\n\n\u201cNew money isn\u2019t coming in; it\u2019s all just rotating [...] Unless we get a new narrative or Stocks to find a way to rally, it\u2019s looking more likely that the U.S. elections in 2024 will be the next big catalyst.\u201d\n\nBTC price chart technicals meanwhile show BTC/USD consolidating below its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), near $27,650.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFailure to decisively breakout above this important resistance area will increase the chances of a pullback.\n\nTraders should then watch for a possible correction toward the 200-day EMA near $25,000 \u2014 the next major support area, particularly if the Fed hikes by 25 basis points in June.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin, gold and the debt ceiling \u2014 Does something have to give?\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "These days, the ranks of so-called bitcoin whales \u2014 major holders like Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy and Binance boss Changpeng Zhao \u2014 include the U.S. government.\n\nThe government presently possesses over 50,000 BTC, which it seized during an investigation into a years-old theft from the now-defunct dark market Silk Road. These holdings have since become the subject of intense scrutiny and chain-watching for any signs of life or movement.\n\nStill, while it's clear that MicroStrategy and other whales are by all appearances keen to \"hodl\" their bitcoins, the market intentions of the U.S. government \u2014 and the overall impact their position has on the market \u2014 is less clear.\n\nThat level of uncertainty has been cause for concern before. Last month, a data labeling issue on a chain-sleuthing platform mistakenly signaled that funds held by the U.S. government were on the move. Those revelations turned out to be untrue, but for a time, the market treated them as gospel.\n\nThese days, such matters \u2014 and the potential for legitimate movements \u2014 are the subject of chatter among trading desks.\n\n\"Players have begun to monitor for the appearance of various statistically robust indicators of 'authentic' selling, and they have likewise started to observe and estimate the timing and nature of the execution, and how to respond to it in kind,\" noted Gordon Grant, co-head of trading at Genesis Trading.\n\nIndeed, relative to market participants across the space, the U.S. government is perhaps viewed as the most important.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Owing to the degree of transparency on-chain, there is a far greater ability to monitor the movements of these concentrated holdings than there would be for other state actors who, even if at all comparable in size, are not nearly as observable,\" Grant added. \"Hence, in terms of magnitude, psychological import, and quantitative precision, the US government's actions with bitcoin will remain extremely closely watched.\"\n\nThe sheer size of the U.S. government's holdings makes it an anxiety-inducing \"bogeyman\" given the prospect that \u2014 in the interest of the U.S. dollar dominance \u2014 federal officials could sell off its holdings en mass to tank the market. But in Grant's view, the government has been more tactical.\n\n\"The timing and tempo of future sales may help determine if this is more than a ghoulish fascination of the broader market - such as one with a specific intent to create price effects or provide liquidity into an unbalanced market, as some EM central banks do,\" he explained.\n\nSuch prospective sales may also offer a new business opportunity for startups keen to get a piece of the action.\n\nTwo people familiar with the situation have told The Block that the U.S. government uses Coinbase to sell its bitcoin, and other industry firms are interested in drawing away some of that business. Coinbase declined to comment when reached."

        "title": "Wall Street Analyst Gary Shilling: I Don't Understand Bitcoin - CCN.com",
        "content": "Gary Shilling, a prominent and highly regarded Wall Street financial analyst, recently said in an interview that he doesn\u2019t understand Bitcoin and do not intend to invest in \u201cthings that are not transparent.\u201d\n\nWhile his statement was factually inaccurate, as Bitcoin is the most transparent financial network in existence due to its decentralized blockchain network, it is optimistic to see investors acknowledge their lack of knowledge in Bitcoin, rather than simply calling out Bitcoin as a \u201cbubble\u201d or a \u201cfraud,\u201d as figures such as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon did in the past.\n\nShilling Doesn\u2019t Want to Invest in Bitcoin Because he Doesn\u2019t Understand It\n\nOver the past 12 months, the viewpoints of analysts and billionaire investors such as Mark Cuban, Peter Schiff, and Gary Shilling have changed drastically. Cuban, who had consistently described Bitcoin as a bubble, inevitably invested in Bitcoin through a Swedish Bitcoin exchange-traded note (ETN) known as XBT provider. SchiffGold, the company of Peter Schiff that is overseen by GoldMoney, integrated Bitcoin for its clients.\n\nIn a recent interview with Business Insider, Shilling admitted that he does not understand the technical intricacies and the fundamental concept of Bitcoin. Shilling said:\n\n\u201cI recently met a friend of mine, a West Coast venture capitalist. He was very early on this [Bitcoin]. He\u2019s made a lot of money on this and so on. I cornered him at a cocktail party and I said \u2018Now listen, I want you to explain to me what this really is.\u2019 I\u2019m just very suspicious of things that are not transparent. If i can\u2019t understand it, I don\u2019t want to invest in it.\u201d\n\nShilling\u2019s investment method is praiseworthy and should recommended to casual investors. It is definitely not intelligent for investors to invest in assets and currencies that they do not have solid knowledge of. As Hacked.com reported, Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos advised investors to only invest an amount of money in Bitcoin that is proportional to their knowledge in the cryptocurrency. He said:\n\n\u201cMy small savings that I do have are invested in bitcoin. 100 percent [of it]. I actually have a tiny debt in US dollars that I\u2019m still trying to pay off so it is more than 100 percent in bitcoin. Now, I\u2019d like to emphasize again, that is not a recommendation to invest. Because I haven\u2019t invested by money in bitcoin, I invested my career, my intellectual capacity, my creativity energy, my passion, and my work in bitcoin. The money is the least of the investment that I have made in bitcoin and I could lose everything of it and I\u2019d still have everything else.\u201d\n\nLandscape is Changing, More People are Starting to Understand Bitcoin\n\nIf investors do not understand Bitcoin and its concept of a peer-to-peer decentralized financial network, they should not invest in it. For investors like Shilling who has been exposed to the centralized monetary system of fiat currency for many decades, it is significantly more difficult to grasp the concept of decentralized networks and peer-to-peer financial systems.\n\nBut, more investors are starting to understand it. As Shilling noted, many venture capitalists, institutional investors, and large-scale retail traders have started to invest in Bitcoin. Most notably, Fidelity and Mike Novogratz have been strong advocates of Bitcoin.\n\nMost recently, George Kikvadze, the vice president at Bitfury, one of the largest blockchain development and Bitcoin mining firms, stated:\n\n\u201cGreat to finish up dinner with one of world\u2019s\u2019 largest wealth funds and convince them to invest in both Bitcoin and Litecoin.\u201d\n\nFeatured image from YouTube/Business Insider ."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said the company isn\u2019t just aware of Ordinals, it\u2019s interested in how the protocol that\u2019s set Bitcoin\u2019s community abuzz could lead to software innovation.\n\nIn an interview at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, Saylor exclusively told Decrypt that the software firm is looking at Ordinals and assessing its potential in terms of application development.\n\nOften used to create NFT-like assets on top of Bitcoin, Ordinals launched in January, and the protocol\u2014while not embraced entirely by the Bitcoin community\u2014has created a new wave of experimentation with crypto\u2019s oldest coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne recent innovation in the space leveraging Ordinals is an experimental framework for building tokens on top of Bitcoin. It was pioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo in early March. And since then, thousands of other so-called BRC-20 tokens have been created.\n\nAll those transactions have been partly\u2014or entirely, depending on who you ask\u2014responsible for elevated transaction fees on Bitcoin. That\u2019s been a boon for Bitcoin miners, who collect transaction fees for their role in securing the network. But lots of members of the community have complained that high fees make it harder for regular people to use BTC as the peer-to-peer electronic cash system that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, intended it to be.\n\nThe discussion surrounding Ordinals is important, Saylor said, because \u201cBitcoin miners have to be successful over the long term.\u201d He added that the development of applications building on Bitcoin\u2019s functionality could also bolster the coin\u2019s overall adoption, among individuals, firms, and governments.\n\nSaylor didn\u2019t specifically say what use cases MicroStrategy could be looking into that tap Ordinals, but he noted the ability to commit data to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that isn\u2019t solely related to transactions has many potential applications.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document,\u201d Saylor said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTouching on corporate security, Saylor mentioned DocuSign, which lets businesses and individuals send and sign agreements securely using the firm\u2019s electronic signature product. But that makes mega corporations reliant on a proprietary database, Saylor noted.\n\n\u201cRight now, enterprises have weak security compared to Bitcoin,\u201d Saylor said, adding that innovations using the world's largest cryptocurrency could possibly \u201cintroduce a new level of security\u201d available to firms \u201cthat doesn't exist right now.\u201d\n\nSaylor\u2019s comments come just a week after he described Ordinals as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for Bitcoin adoption on the PBD Podcast. Still, he acknowledges that Ordinals have been used for plenty of silly reasons.\n\n\"The general consensus is criticize stuff that we think is silly, but don't censor it,\" he said on Thursday in Miami.\n\nSaylor didn't want to predict \"which protocol will win,\u201d but he said altering Bitcoin so that it censors certain uses would be wrong. It was a nod to the effort by a group of core Bitcoin developers, including Luke Dashjr, to treat Ordinals as \"spam\" and filter them out of transactions.\n\n\u201cIf somebody wants to change the protocol, in order to censor someone else from using Bitcoin, I don't think that's consistent with the values of the community,\u201d Saylor said. \u201cI do believe in rules without rulers.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin rose 1.78% from May 12 to May 19 to trade at US$26,846 as of 7:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading under US$30,000 since April 19. Ether rose 2.44% over the week to US$1,808 after falling below US$1,800 multiple times this week.\n\n\u201cLooking at the charts, Bitcoin is currently demonstrating a new bear flag pattern, indicating a potential downward trend after weeks caught in a range below US$30,500, which has remained a price ceiling for numerous weeks now,\u201d said Tim Frost, the chief executive officer of digital wealth platform Yield App. \u201cThe bear flag is presently targeting a price decline to approximately US$24,000,\u201d\n\n\u201cAn opportunity to go long could arise around US$23,000. If the Bitcoin market were to flush out to this level, there would likely then be a bounce,\u201d he added.\n\nThe prospect of a governmental default in the U.S. weighed down market sentiment this week after the U.S. Treasury Department reiterated on Monday that it expects to default by June 1 without a debt limit increase. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy signaled on Wednesday that they\u2019re committed to reaching an agreement on raising the government\u2019s US$31.4 trillion debt ceiling.\n\nOver in Europe, inflation accelerated to 7.0% in April from 6.9% a month earlier, mainly driven by rising services and energy costs. Core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, slowed to 7.3% from 7.5%, according to Eurostat. Further interest rate hikes can be expected, as inflation is still above the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target.\n\nLiquid Ether staking protocol Lido Finance passed the community vote to execute the Lido V2 upgrade, which went live on Monday, enabling Ether and staked Ether (stETH) withdrawals directly on the protocol. Following the upgrade, Lido\u2019s stETH supply fell by over 437,000 stETH on Wednesday, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nThe rate of Ordinals inscriptions, a version of non-fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, slowed down this week after the network passed a new milestone of 7 million inscriptions on Sunday, Dune Analytics data shows. However, Bitcoin network congestion remained high this week, with over 263,548 transactions waiting to be validated at 7:30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Friday.\n\nThe heightened demand for block space was mainly driven by the growth of BRC-20 tokens, the fungible tokens standard built on the Ordinals protocol. The number of different types of BRC-20s grew from 14,300 tokens on May 11 to 24,677 on Friday, according to data provider BRC-20.io.\n\nA new security concern emerged after crypto wallet firm Ledger announced the launch of Ledger Recover, an optional recovery service for users\u2019 seed phrases \u2014 causing widespread community distress about Ledger\u2019s potential backdoor into users\u2019 seed phrases. Ledger Chief Technology Officer Charles Guillemet attempted to quell the fire by saying, \u201cThere is no backdoor for anyone, neither us, a provider or even a very gifted hacker to access it.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.12 trillion on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 1.8% from US$1.1 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data.

An analysis shows that despite continued interest in Bitcoin nonfungible tokens (NFTs), most Bitcoin Ordinals have shifted to text-based inscriptions, compared with a somewhat equal balance of text and image inscriptions from February to April.\n\nAs explained by cross-chain wallet BitKeep, Bitcoin Ordinals \u201cis a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each individual SAT [Satoshi, or 1/100 million of a Bitcoin], enabling its tracking and transfer.\u201c Combined with the inscription process, which adds an additional layer of data to each satoshi, this allows users to mint unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTotal Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions have increased significantly over time.

On top of this, Web3 developer domo created the BRC-20 Bitcoin token standard in March 2023, employing both Ordinals and inscriptions to create and manage token contracts, token minting, and token transfers on Bitcoin.\n\nSince then, over 8 million Bitcoin Ordinals have been minted, along with 24,677 BRC-20 tokens created, boasting a total market cap of $612.5 million.

        "content": "Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT), is introducing a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin. He has reportedly lined up $100 million from high-profile venture-capital investors, and he has already released a World App crypto wallet that can be downloaded to your mobile phone. Altman has big plans for Worldcoin as the first-ever cryptocurrency to be held by every person on the planet.\n\nSo what would this new crypto mean for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), currently the world's most popular digital currency? After all, in more than a decade, Bitcoin has never fulfilled some of its earliest ambitions -- such as replacing fiat currency or becoming a ubiquitous form of online payment. Could the rise of a new competitor force investors to rethink Bitcoin's valuation?\n\nWhat is Worldcoin?\n\nWorldcoin is an ERC-20 token for the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) blockchain. What this means in practical terms is that Worldcoin will look (and trade) much like the cryptocurrencies that investors are already familiar with. Some of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap are ERC-20 tokens, including Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) and Uniswap (CRYPTO: UNI). So in this regard, Worldcoin is not breaking any new ground.\n\nWhat makes Worldcoin stand out is the fact that it has aspirations to be both a cryptocurrency and a global identification system. With a tag line of \"the global economy belongs to everyone,\" Sam Altman plans to distribute Worldcoin tokens to every single human on planet Earth.\n\nAnd this is where things get a little bit, well, creepy. To pick up your free Worldcoin crypto token and sign up for a Worldcoin ID, you will need to give Sam Altman a scan of your eyeballs. That's right -- Worldcoin has created a proprietary iris-scanning tool known as the Orb. Once you've had your eyeballs scanned with the Orb, you're good to go. According to Altman, this step is necessary to verify that you are a real human and is not meant to be an invasion of your privacy. He won't even ask you for your name.\n\nHowever, it's easy to see how some people on YouTube are going to have a field day with Worldcoin. The launch of this cryptocurrency sounds like the plot of a dystopian sci-fi film: The creator of the world's most powerful AI system has created a digital ID tracking system for all humans on earth and is now requiring that digital ID to invest in crypto. Already, one Ethereum developer has called Worldcoin \"unrealistic and scary.\"\n\nWorldcoin vs. Bitcoin\n\nThat said, Worldcoin has at least two advantages over Bitcoin. One, of course, is superior technology. Bitcoin is still using proof-of-work blockchain technology from 2009 that requires mining and energy-hungry computer-driven mining systems. Worldcoin, on the other hand, uses the latest proof-of-stake technology from Ethereum, as well as technology from different Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum. According to Worldcoin, \"gas-free\" transactions -- meaning free -- will become the norm. In layman's terms, there will be no transaction fees of any kind when you move around your Worldcoin.\n\nWorldcoin also seems poised for much faster uptake than Bitcoin. More than 1.7 million people around the globe, for example, have already registered with Worldcoin. Contrast that with Bitcoin, which took nearly 14 years to get to 1 million unique wallet addresses holding 1 bitcoin or more.\n\nAnd don't forget that Sam Altman has some ChatGPT magic dust he can sprinkle on top of Worldcoin. ChatGPT skyrocketed to 1 million users in just five days, which could explain why investors are willing to give Sam Altman $100 million for this new crypto project. He knows how to scale quickly. Just imagine the cross-promotion opportunities! What if every time you used ChatGPT, you saw a friendly reminder to sign up for Worldcoin? Or if the only way to pay for a premium ChatGPT subscription was via Worldcoin?\n\nHow to value Bitcoin?\n\nAt the end of the day, though, Worldcoin's plans for global expansion seem a bit too grandiose. Altman, for example, wants to get to 1 billion users in two years. But the Earth's population is 8 billion people now, so the ultimate goal of getting Worldcoin into the hands of every single person on Earth seems impractical at best. So I really don't think Bitcoin has anything to worry about for now.\n\nHowever, if Worldcoin does gain early traction, that's when we will need to have a serious discussion about Bitcoin's future valuation. Many of the most optimistic price predictions for Bitcoin -- such as $1 million per coin -- are based on the fundamental notion that Bitcoin will continue to chip away at the world's financial system. From my perspective, Worldcoin (by virtue of being free) has the best chance of any altcoin to replace Bitcoin in poor and developing markets.\n\nFor now, I'm putting Worldcoin on my watchlist. The crypto is a fascinating project from the founder of ChatGPT, so it can't be dismissed entirely. But that doesn't mean I'm selling my Bitcoin. I can't think of any other crypto I'd rather be holding, even if the AI overlords eventually take over."

This is the \u201cwork\u201d in a proof-of-work consensus and the cornerstone of early blockchain networks, most famously Bitcoin. The miner that stumbles upon the magic number wins the right to process a batch of transactions, known as a block, then adds them to a growing list of transactions called the blockchain.\n\nFor their trouble, the winning miner receives newly minted cryptocurrency, which can be sold for a profit, granted that the mine operator hasn\u2019t been crippled by the energy bill required to run the computer. In the case of Bitcoin, the \u201cblock reward\u201d initially amounted to 500 bitcoins, but the payoff has been periodically halved so that by 2022 the reward was 6.25.\n\nEndless rounds of this game have played out every 10 minutes since Bitcoin launched in early 2009. Even after all Bitcoin has been mined and rewards for miners drop to next to nothing\u2014likely by the year 2140\u2014miners will continue to process Bitcoin transaction fees.\n\nMining contributes to the decentralization of the network since it\u2019s hard for an individual miner to corral together enough energy to manipulate the game. In the early days of Bitcoin, it was possible to mine on a laptop or even a cellphone but today mining is dominated by companies employing specialized computers connected to giant power sources.\n\nCritics of proof of work argue that a lot of the electricity used to power crypto mining industries comes from dirty sources of energy. But advocates maintain that these networks are worth the tradeoff. And some mining companies, especially those in North America, are basing their activity around clean energy sources.\n\nIn light of the criticisms, plus the up-front cost of getting a network of miners up and running, newer blockchain projects have started to favor proof of stake, an alternative mechanism that grants transaction validation rights to those who have locked up the most coins in the network. By switching to proof of stake in 2022, the second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum reduced its energy consumption by 99.5%, according to the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation that supports it.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nCambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index\n\nMining Pool Stats\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat is proof of stake?\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nWhat are blockchains?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nBitcoin mining 101\u2014set up your own rig using this guide from ZDNet"

        "content": "Update (5/19/2023 18:50 UTC): This article has been updated to reflect that Lule Demmissie is the CEO of eToro US, the U.S. subsidiary of cryptocurrency exchange eToro. Previously, Demmissie was erroneously stated as the CEO of eToro instead of eToro US. The CEO of eToro is Yoni Assia. Cointelegraph regrets this error.\n\nThe financial service provider eToro and Twitter recently announced a partnership that allows users on the social network platform to trade cryptocurrencies and stocks.\n\nThis development follows a statement made by former Twitter CEO Elon Musk, who said he wants to make Twitter \u201cthe biggest financial institution in the world.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph sat down with Lule Demmissie, the CEO of eToro\u2019s U.S. branch, eToro US, at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami to understand what a social network and social trading platform integration can mean for the future of digital finance.\n\nCointelegraph reporter Joe Hall with eToro US CEO Lule Demmissie at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nDemmissie said it \u201cmade sense\u201d that one of the world\u2019s largest social network platforms would partner with a social trading platform. Now, when users obtain financial news and updates on securities, ETFs or other assets, they can choose to \u201cpractice, engage or trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe symbiosis is really sort of like converse, learn, practice, invest.\u201d\n\nAlready, Twitter\u2019s \u201ccashtags,\u201d which allow users to view real-time trading data, have garnered half a billion search hits on the platform.\n\nRelated: Paraspace NFT protocol co-founder resigns after failing to overthrow CEO\n\nThe eToro US CEO said the company has a \u201cholistic\u201d approach to the crypto ecosystem, not favoring one type of asset class over another. She said that diversification is important both \u201cat the instrument level as well as the asset-class level.\u201d\n\nDemmissie also highlighted that digital assets can be \u201ctransformative\u201d in nature if they are \u201callowed into our lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about digital assets is that you become both the beneficiary and the product. It\u2019s a really transformative way of thinking about justice and capital formation \u2014 benefiting from the same thing that you feed.\u201d\n\nHowever, she also pointed out that as digital assets become more available, the need to have better self-regulation practices increases. Particularly, she said to take from the \u201clessons of the last two years,\u201d and not \u201cmisdiagnose\u201d those lessons.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin glory on Chinese TikTok, 30M mainland users, Justin Sun saga"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nMeme coins are on the rise in unfamiliar places thanks to Ordinals, the project launched in January on the Bitcoin network. It started with an NFT-like effort to \"inscribe\" assets like artwork and profile pictures onto Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, but soon evolved to support BRC-20 tokens minted using the same protocol.\n\nNow, thanks to the sensation surrounding Ordinal inscriptions and meme tokens on Bitcoin\u2014not to mention the increasingly high network fees that resulted\u2014inscribers have brought the latest craze in blockchain to Litecoin and Dogecoin. And in the process, they\u2019ve sent daily transaction totals to the moon.\n\nOn Wednesday, the three largest proof-of-work blockchains by market capitalization collectively tallied over 2 million daily transactions: 579,260 on Bitcoin, 363,885 on Litecoin, and 1.126 million on Dogecoin alone, per data from BitInfoCharts. Each chain has also marked a respective all-time single-day peak for transactions so far in May.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow did we get here? Ordinals coming to Litecoin and Dogecoin was a natural progression, considering that Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was based on code forked from Litecoin. They're all related, in a sense, and that's what has led to the migration of Ordinals tech from Bitcoin to the others.\n\nMeanwhile, the BRC-20 and subsequent LTC-20 and DRC-20 standards were inspired by Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens, allowing developers to create \u201cfungible tokens\u201d on the blockchains. It was a lighthearted experiment on Bitcoin... until the tokens caught on and nearly reached a collective $1 billion market cap.\n\nGiven that, it's no surprise to see the trend catch on elsewhere since. And Ordinals and the resulting meme token frenzy is already having a sizable impact on Litecoin and Dogecoin alike. Here's a look at how it happened.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals\n\nIn January, software engineer Casey Rodamor released the Ordinals protocol, which let users transfer and receive individual satoshis\u2014that is, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin (1/100,000,000 BTC). The key upgrade here is that they could include inscribed data like videos or images, instead of simply storing transaction data.\n\nIn March, Ordinal inscriptions hit a new high after a pseudonymous creator named Domo launched the BRC-20\u2014short for \"Bitcoin Request for Comment\"\u2014 implementation. BRC-20 allowed the creation of \"fungible tokens\" on the Bitcoin network, opening the door for anyone to create meme tokens on the original blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs newer tools and infrastructure have made Ordinals easier to inscribe and handle, the total number of inscriptions has soared, topping 8 million as of this writing. And with over 24,000 BRC-20 tokens minted to date, the total combined market cap is currently over $618 million\u2014and previously neared $1 billion in total. Bitcoin transactions set a single-day record of 682,000 on May 1 amid the meme token frenzy.\n\nCritics of Ordinal inscriptions point to the rising cost of transactions on these blockchains now that blocks are filled with JPEGs and meme tokens, with some going so far as to call it a potential attack vector and that Ordinals and meme tokens should be blocked on the network. However, proponents of Ordinals say that the higher cost help secure the network.\n\nLitecoin Ordinals\n\nFollowing the Ordinals-fueled explosion in activity on the Bitcoin network, the inscription protocol made its way to the Litecoin network. Litecoin was launched in 2011 as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain and was a prominent cryptocurrency for years, though it has been overshadowed at times by newer and buzzier coins.\n\nOrdinals came to Litecoin in February after a challenge from pseudonymous Twitter user Indigo Nakamoto, who initially offered 5 LTC (around $500) to anyone who could port the Ordinals protocol to Litecoin\u2014and the prize pool quickly grew. Software engineer Anthony Guerrera launched Litecoin Ordinals after forking the Bitcoin code.\n\nIn May, the LTC-20 standard was introduced to Litecoin, bringing meme tokens to the network. Litecoin transactions surged after the addition of Ordinals, going from 100,684 transactions on May 1 to hit an all-time high of 584,836 transactions on May 10. Over 2.6 million Litecoin Ordinals have now been inscribed, according to the Litecoin Foundation.\n\nDogecoin Ordinals\n\nThat same month, meme token and digital artifacts using Ordinal inscriptions made their way to the original meme coin network, Dogecoin, by introducing the DRC-20 standard. Users began filling the blockchain by inscribing tokens into the smallest denomination of a Dogecoin, sometimes referred to as \"shibes\" or \"koinu,\" after copying the Ordinals protocol to create \u201cDoginals.\u201d\n\nDogecoin saw an even heavier surge in activity than its contemporaries, at least in terms of daily transaction volume, which jumped from about 88,000 on Monday to over 1.1 million on Wednesday. Not everyone is convinced that the trend is strong enough to last, however.\n\n\u201cSomething like this cannot become a real \u2018feature\u2019 because it has not had enough thought given to it,\u201d Dogecoin core developer Patrick Lodder told Decrypt this week. Furthermore, he believes that the impact on the broader network will cool the hype, adding that \u201csustained and growing pressure on Dogecoin will cause this to die off quickly.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify the terms used to describe the smallest unit of a Dogecoin."

        "title": "Op-ed: Why Ordinals, BRC-20 is bad for Bitcoin - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The emergence of the Ordinals protocol has transformed Bitcoin from a somewhat stale single-asset chain into something much more exciting.\n\nHowever, this newfound excitement has sparked pushback from laser-eyed purists, who argue that BTC was not intended for non-monetary transactions \u2013 some going as far as calling the protocol a spam attack on the network.\n\nBrushing aside the protests, Ordinals Capitalists say a permissionless system also includes the liberty to utilize Bitcoin in any manner one chooses. They accuse purists of attempting to spoil their fun.\n\nThe divergent viewpoints have set the stage for a potential chain split \u2013 which ultimately serves no one\u2019s best interest.\n\nTaproot opened Pandora\u2019s box\n\nThe Taproot soft fork was rolled out in November 2021. At the time, it was primarily regarded as an upgrade to improve network security, efficiency, and scalability. However, it also enabled executable commands and the implementation of certain scripts \u2013 thus laying the foundation for Ethereum-like functionality such as smart contracts and dApps.\n\nIn January, the impact of this additional Ethereum-like functionality began to take shape as developer Casey Rodarmor released Ordinals. This protocol allows for each of the 100,000,000 satoshis in a Bitcoin to be inscribed with additional metadata, including text, images, video, and code.\n\nBy February, the Ordinals protocol was used to write a wizard jpeg into the blockchain, opening the door to a Bitcoin NFT market. But as a \u201csquare peg, round hole\u201d use of the technology, acquiring and trading Bitcoin NFTs was a cumbersome and technically challenging feat, requiring knowledge of node synching and trusting a third party to release the NFT upon payment.\n\nRecently, supporting wallets, including Ordinals Wallet, Xverse, and Hiro Wallet, have rolled out to address these pain points, making the process more like the standard experience NFT buyers are used to.\n\nBefore Ordinals NFTs went live, the average block size was hovering around 1.2 MB, but since its rollout, subsequent blocks have more than doubled on average \u2013 negatively affecting speed and scalability. Additionally, higher transaction fees and chain bloat, through a backlog of unconfirmed transactions, have added to useability problems.\n\nHere come the BRC-20 tokens\n\nThings stepped up in March when anonymous developer \u201cDomo\u201d launched BRC-20 tokens \u2013 bringing a fungible token standard to Bitcoin. By attaching a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to satoshis, details of the BRC-20 token\u2019s characteristics, including its minting and distribution values, are preserved in the network.\n\nSpurred by meme coin season, BRC-20 tokens saw a peak market cap valuation of $1 billion on May 8. However, wider market uncertainty and the prevalence of meme coin rugs have since seen a significant drawdown \u2013 falling to $574 million at the time of press.\n\nPer KuCoin, the booming popularity of BRC-20 has worsened the problems seen with NFTs, causing significant network delays, with some users reporting 4-hour confirmation times. In addition, BRC-20 tokens have further contributed to rising transaction fees.\n\nDespite useability issues, miners are reaping the benefits with on-chain metrics, including Miner Hash Price, which measures miners\u2019 income relative to network contribution, and Miner Percent Mined Supply Spent, which looks at the rate miners sell mined coins, pointing to a reinvigoration of the Bitcoin mining space.\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s analysis concluded that if the momentum continues at its current pace, miners will experience boosted profitability and a greater sense of confidence in the network, leading to a preference to hold onto mined coins.\n\nCommunity split on Ordinals\n\nProminent members of the Bitcoin community have voiced their support of Ordinals. For example, MicroStrategy Chair Michael Saylor said the protocol was responsible for flipping sentiment bullish \u2013 adding that if he was a miner, he would be ecstatic.\n\nMoreover, he pointed out that the technology will lead to many new applications in the long term, some of which could solve critical societal issues \u2013 giving the example of inscribing a will on the blockchain.\n\n\u201cI could also inscribe my last will and testament, and if my last will and testament is moving a billion dollars from me to you, how much is it worth to you to have that burned onto the blockchain and cryptographically verified?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Willy Woo expressed a more pragmatic view, saying there are good and bad points to consider. While additional transaction fees provide strong incentives for miners, which will become more critical in the future as block rewards dwindle with each halving, this comes at the cost of more centralization due to fewer people being willing to run higher bandwidth nodes.\n\nFor now, given that decentralization is not \u201canchored\u201d in, Woo said Ordinals, and the associated boon for miners, arrived too soon for his liking.\n\n\u201cI would have preferred the impact of ordinals to have been a lot later when the security budget becomes more pressing, it would be at a time when decentralisation is already anchored.\u201c\n\nJan3 co-founder Samson Mow played down the significance of Ordinals. He said congestion and high fees are nothing to worry about, as paying massive fees to miners is unsustainable over the long term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question mark on how long they can do that for. Maybe it\u2019s a few more days. Maybe it\u2019s a week. But definately it\u2019s not a sustainable model to throw money away.\u201d\n\nClarifying his position, Mow explained that Ordinals is a largely hype-driven market fueled by short-term money grabs. What\u2019s more, he predicts the sector will disappear once the token issuers have made enough money.\n\n\u201cThey exist to get some gullible people to pay attention to them by doing some crazy antics\u2026 But like most projects that are in the blockchain space, they fade away in relevance once the issuers of the tokens have made their money.\u201d\n\nWhat would Satoshi think?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto cannot express an opinion on whether Ordinals are good or bad for Bitcoin. But people have turned to his Bitcointalk forum posts to try and work out his perspective on the matter.\n\nIn a December 2010 post, Nakamoto supported the idea of keeping the blockchain lean and free from bloat with a view to maximizing scalability.\n\n\u201cPiling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn\u2019t scale.\u201d\n\nNakamoto spoke of segregating non-monetary transactions onto a separate chain called BitDNS \u2013 which was conceived as a sidechain or layer 2 using the Domain Name System internet protocol. Later, this project became an altogether separate alt chain, rebranding to Namecoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately. Users shouldn\u2019t have to download all of both to use one or the other. BitDNS users may not want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide to pile in either.\u201d\n\nBased on this, it seems Nakamoto wanted to keep the mainchain exclusively for monetary transactions and for a sidechain/layer 2 to handle large data features.\n\nThe Bitcoin core devs also seem to have adopted the purist\u2019s stance, as indicated by @frankdegods, who publicized dev plans to extend Taproot spam filters to remove Ordinals altogether.\n\nBitcoin civil war\n\nIn a throwback to 2017 and the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, the question of whether Bitcoin should increase its block size to accommodate Ordinals has ignited debate within the community.\n\nGiven the lack of consensus on the best path forward, the possibility of a further chain split looms increasingly likely. But, of the 105 BTC forks to date, it\u2019s worth noting that all have faded into obscurity.\n\nThe most successful fork, Bitcoin Cash, is down 98.9% against Bitcoin from its 0.43 peak in November 2017. This suggests that an Ordinals fork would likely face significant challenges, making a split futile.\n\nThere is no shortage of alternative layer 1s offering tokenization with the added benefit of more sophisticated features, such as event logic handling. Moreover, these alternative layer 1s can operate at a larger scale and lower cost than Bitcoin \u2013 making Ordinals something of a dinosaur in comparison.\n\nYes, Ordinals has breathed new life into Bitcoin, particularly from a novelty and mining sustainability point of view. But other chains are better at tokenization.\n\nMoreover, to date, the protocol\u2019s primary use case is meme coin investing, which lacks utility, has no collective benefit, and does not contribute to the goal of doing away with the corrupt fiat money system.\n\nOrdinals are bad for Bitcoin because it impedes the objective of revolutionizing money.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Avalanche, Solana, and Cardano are other examples of L1 blockchains.\n\nL1s work well until the network clogs up, which pushes fees higher. This is known as the \u201cscalability\u201d problem. Such problems befell Ethereum during the bull market of 2021, when network fees skyrocketed. Paying $50 in fees to buy a single NFT was common as Ethereum\u2019s popularity soared.\n\nEthereum developers responded by creating a series of fast and cheap L2 blockchains to sit atop the main chain. These included technologies like \u201crollups,\u201d which replicate the Ethereum experience on other chains but in a faster and cheaper fashion. L2s achieve this by bundling lots of L2 transactions into a single L1 transaction\u2014kind of like Uber Pool for crypto.\n\nMost L2s are built on Ethereum to compensate for the slow speeds and high cost that made that the chain unviable for many back in 2021. Ethereum\u2019s L2s tend to be a lot cheaper than L1s; transaction fees on an L2 decentralized lending protocol can be 20 times less expensive than on an L1. Yet in doing so, L2s still rely on the security of the L1.\n\nArbitrum is the largest Ethereum L2, with around $870 million locked into its smart contracts and 116 protocols, as of October 2022. Optimism, another layer 2, lags narrowly behind with $850 million locked into 72 protocols. Another popular L2 service is Polygon, which is technically a \u201csidechain\u201d and not a roll up since it has its own consensus mechanism.\n\nThe widely adopted layer-2 chain for Bitcoin is called the Lightning Network. It lets people pay for things in Bitcoin without requiring the base-layer blockchain to confirm transactions. That makes payments instantaneous\u2014although anyone who uses it must first lock up however much Bitcoin they plan to use.\n\n\n\nGo deeper:\n\nUnderstanding rollup economics from first principles\u2014Barnab\u00e9 Monnot, Ethereum Foundation\n\nScalable off-chain instant payments\u2014White paper\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nWhat are crypto bridges?\n\n\n\nTry it:\n\nHop Exchange\u2014send crypto between different Ethereum layers\n\nStrike\u2014send Bitcoin to this beginner-friendly (custodial) Lightning Network wallet"

        "title": "Why is Bitcoin stuck below $30,000? A look at three possible reasons - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has been choppy recently, trading between the $28,000 level and $26,000 over the past week and a half. Several analysts believe that the next key threshold is $30,000, which would provide Bitcoin with a much-needed psychological lift.\n\nKeeping external developments in mind, such as the US banking crisis, and worries of a global recession, it is tough to predict how much Bitcoin's value will rise this year. However, a look at certain on-chain data could provide us with some explanations about Bitcoin's previous price performance and why it is stuck below the $30,000 mark.\n\nUnique addresses interacting with Bitcoin slip to new lows\n\nAlthough P/E ratios and profit and revenue statistics are not available for digital assets, there are other fundamentals to consider in order to determine a cryptocurrency's health.\n\nOne common way to assess the same is by looking at the activity of unique addresses within a network. In the Bitcoin ecosystem, unique addresses refer to payment addresses that have a non-zero balance. In theory, growth in unique addresses is a positive development as it signals increased demand for a cryptocurrency. A drop in unique addresses, on the other hand, indicates that demand has slowed.\n\nAnalytical platform Santiment recently highlighted that the unique Bitcoin addresses that interact with the network slipped to a 22-month low. As per Santiment, a little less than 80,000 hourly active addresses are transacting on the Bitcoin network at the moment, a far cry from the hourly active addresses that once soared above 1.1 million. Furthermore, the drastic drop in the metric was comparable to June 2021 levels, during which Bitcoin\u2019s price slipped to $28,600, its lowest point in nearly 5 months at the time.\n\nIn simpler words, the data shows that Bitcoin holders have been less keen to interact with their coins amidst an uncertain environment, and the low volatility could be keeping Bitcoin restricted below $30,000.\n\nSupply on exchanges hit new lows\n\nHistorically, supply held on exchanges can signal bullish or bearish market sentiment. A rudimentary explanation of this phenomenon is as follows.\n\nWhen the supply of particular cryptocurrencies on exchanges increases, it indicates that traders are not interested in retaining the digital assets and are likely selling to exchanges in expectation of a price drop. Conversely, a low amount of supply on exchanges indicates that traders are comfortable retaining assets and anticipate a price increase in the near future. In Bitcoin\u2019s case, the supply on exchanges slipped to its lowest in five years during the second week of May 2023. Santiment showed that the supply has continued to slip on exchanges since then as well. But isn\u2019t that a positive development? Not if you throw a wrench in the works.\n\nYou may be aware that, following the infamous collapse of FTX, centralized exchanges have been under intense scrutiny. Many exchanges have been compelled to limit the products or services they offer in top crypto countries, like the United States, due to regulatory pressure. In the face of this regulatory uncertainty, several companies, such as Coinbase, are considering relocating their headquarters.\n\nTherefore, a lower supply of Bitcoins on exchanges could be interpreted as investors hoarding digital assets amidst regulatory uncertainty. In other words, it means that no money is flowing into Bitcoin. Recently, CoinDesk argued that a dwindling stablecoin balance on exchanges suggested that the rotation of money out of stablecoins and into BTC has been the major driver of the cryptocurrency's 70 percent rally this year, and not new institutional inflows.\n\nProfit-Taking\n\nThe interaction between traders at certain price levels helps understand the position of market bulls and bears. On that front, data platform CryptoQuant revealed that a possible explanation for Bitcoin\u2019s price being stuck below the $30,000 mark is due to the presence of profit-taking investors who bought Bitcoin at $28,600.\n\nThe data was compiled by analysing Bitcoin\u2019s Sum Coin Age Distribution chart, which reflects the distribution of coin holders by their holding duration. The chart noted a sharp decline after May 2, 2023, suggesting that a large number of traders were liquidating their Bitcoins to realize profits. CryptoQuant explained that the data is a typical reaction to a market reaching a probable local peak. It said that due to an increase in market sales volume, there's downward pressure on Bitcoin, which is hindering its growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nAside from macroeconomic concerns, various internal variables may be hindering Bitcoin's price rebound over the $30,000 threshold. However, this does not guarantee that Bitcoin's price would climb if these measures begin to indicate favourable results.\n\nInstead, these indicators aid in understanding historical price performance, whereas future performance is determined by a number of varying factors. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $26,931, down by 1.25 percent over the last 24 hours."

        "title": "The rise of Bitcoin SV: Joshua Henslee talks to the Cryptocurrency Theory podcast - CoinGeek",
        "content": "width=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nJoshua Henslee recently checked in with the Cryptocurrency Theory podcast to talk to Chad Bailey about Bitcoin SV, Ordinals, and much more.\n\nHow both Henslee and Bailey got into digital currencies and blockchain technology\n\nHenslee introduces himself as a Bitcoin maximalist and lays out his stance that the original Bitcoin had everything we needed.\n\nBailey asks Henslee for his Bitcoin story, what initially attracted him to the technology, and why it\u2019s important to him. Henslee tells his host about his background in integrating business software and payment systems and credit card processors. He tells viewers how this is a technical nightmare and is very inefficient.\n\nWhen Bitcoin ran up in 2017, Henslee began to pay attention. He read the white paper and instantly got it. Since then, he\u2019s been tumbling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole.\n\nBailey relates to this, saying he fell in love with it immediately. He says he\u2019s still amazed at how few people understand the technology, including people working in or studying computer science, who you\u2019d expect to be up to date on cutting-edge technology. He then asks Henslee, \u201cwhy Bitcoin SV?\u201d\n\nWhy Bitcoin SV?\n\nHenslee begins by giving some context. The reason he was interested in Bitcoin in the first place is because he knew it was light years ahead of the credit card processing solutions he worked with every day. He reminds us that Satoshi made it clear that peer-to-peer transactions with no trusted third parties are the way Bitcoin transactions are meant to occur. This is the polar opposite of how credit cards work, which is the reason for their problems.\n\nAfter small blockers caused Bitcoin fees to increase exponentially compared to what they were in the early days, Henslee began looking into Ethereum, Litecoin, BCH, and other blockchains. He eventually consolidated into BCH, and when an argument broke out in that camp, he landed on the BSV side.\n\n\u201cWhat Satoshi designed is nothing like what BTC is today,\u201d Henslee tells the audience. He explains how Bitcoin script allowed smart contracts on the blockchain; there was no block size limit, it scaled and had low fees, etc. \u201cEthereum only exists because the Bitcoin Core developers disabled the script,\u201d he tells Bailey, remembering how BTC Core developers chased Vitalik Buterin off and told him what he wanted to build wasn\u2019t allowed.\n\nBailey takes a moment to remind his viewers, many of whom are new to digital currencies, that BCH and BSV are far from down and out. He reminds us that they had a huge impact on the entire ecosystem when the forks happened, and just the other day, BSV shot up 30% on massively increased volume.\n\nA huge BSV price pump back in 2020\n\nBailey directs viewers to Henslee\u2019s video analyzing the historical BSV price. He asks Henslee to explain more about these events and what caused them.\n\nHenslee answers that two come to mind. The first came after the CoinGeek Toronto Conference in May 2019, and the other was caused by a false rumor coming out of China that Dr. Craig Wright had publicly signed with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s keys; this caused BSV to rise rapidly against other digital currencies and independently of them.\n\nOn this second pump, BSV moved into the top five coins by market cap and surpassed BCH for the first and only time so far. BTC maximalists melted down, sensing the threat of miners switching to the BSV chain, and moved to attack BSV.\n\nHenslee says he once again noticed BSV and BCH moving independently of the rest of the market last week. This is because of concerns about whether Ordinals will cause a BTC chain split or will cause the BTC blockchain to fail. He says this could happen faster than people expect.\n\n\u201cBSV only has to get to around 5% of BTC to start causing problems,\u201d he tells viewers.\n\nOrdinals, JPEGs, and bigger BTC blocks\n\nBailey asks Henslee to explain how a 4MB block on BTC was possible and what Ordinals are all about.\n\nHenslee explains that Ordinals are possible because of specific changes BTC Core developers made to Satoshi\u2019s original design, SegWit and Taproot. An independent developer found a way to put data on the blockchain even though BTC Core had explicitly blocked this.\n\n\u201cThe whole crypto market was under the impression that you can\u2019t do data on BTC. That changed in January 2023,\u201d he says.\n\nHenslee describes the innovation and activity on BTC since Casey Rodarmor found the loophole as \u201ca renaissance.\u201d He delves into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens (BRC-20), explaining how swapping BTC for tokens like $ORDI on the BTC blockchain is possible. The returns on this particular token so far have been absurd, proving the market has responded positively to these developments. Henslee once again iterates his position that this is a game changer.\n\nMining on BSV\n\nBailey wraps up by asking Henslee if he thinks BSV only having two miners could be a problem.\n\nHenslee explains that there\u2019s no real incentive to mine BSV in the wider ecosystem; the coin price is low, and the fees are so small that they barely register. This does open the chain up to potential attacks, and there have been attacks such as the empty block miner in 2022.\n\nThe only way to fix this is a higher coin price or more transactions, Henslee says. He notes that transaction fees could increase, but that debate has already happened in BSV, and the fees remain low.\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Whitepaper | Section One: The Introduction\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "What is the environmental cost of using cryptocurrency? - Happiful Magazine",
        "content": "We\u2019re decoding the environmental impact of virtual currencies\n\nFrom Bitcoin to Ethereum, cryptocurrencies are a much-hyped alternative method of payment that have been making headlines for the past few years. But the big question that\u2019s beginning to arise is whether the energy expended on these virtual transactions could actually be having a very real detrimental impact on the planet. So, we\u2019re here to ask: are digital denominations the face of the future, or something that could break the bank?\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrencies use advanced cryptography to create secure financial transactions, giving rise to their name. Rather than having physical cash, or transactions going through banks for verification of funds, cryptocurrencies are decentralised \u2013 they require no central bank or clearing house. Transactions take place between digital wallets, and are recorded on the \u2018blockchain\u2019, which is a public ledger.\n\nBut where does this \u2018money\u2019 come from? Founded in 2009, Bitcoin was the original digital currency, and remains the most recognisable today. \u2018Coins\u2019 are created through a process called \u2018mining\u2019, which requires specialised computers to solve intricate mathematical puzzles to find a specific number. The first to find a number which meets the network\u2019s difficulty target is declared the winner, and is rewarded with Bitcoin. In essence, a Bitcoin can be likened to a unique serial code on a banknote. However, given it\u2019s not a physical item, its value is determined by users agreeing upon its worth.\n\nYou can also buy Bitcoins with traditional currency, which will add units of crypto to your digital wallet, accessed with a \u2018key\u2019 that allows you to transfer these units to others.\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nCrypto was created due to concerns around the stability of the modern financial system, with numerous banks being bailed out by the government in recent years, including Lloyds Banking Group and Natwest in 2008, while others like Bradford & Bingley went under. By focusing on peer-to-peer transfers, and eliminating third parties to verify funds, users aren\u2019t affected by the bank\u2019s success or failure. Additionally, data is stored in your personal wallet, and can only be accessed with a private key.\n\nDecentralised and capped\n\nOperating on decentralised networks means cryptocurrencies are not subject to government regulations or interventions, and given there are caps on the total number of currency available, e.g. a limit of 21 million Bitcoins was created, it\u2019s believed this could protect against inflation. With a finite amount available, as demand increases, the value will rise in line with the market, theoretically.\n\nAccessibility and transparency\n\nID checks typically performed in banks don\u2019t apply here, which can expedite the process, allowing anyone with internet access and a smartphone to utilise it. Plus, the public ledger, Blockchain, offers full transparency of transactions.\n\nHowever, there are important considerations. Given the rise in online banking, contactless cards, and Apple Pay, the drive towards a cashless society might make life simpler for some, but frustrating for those less confident with technology. Then, there are the worries of losing access to your money if you forget your digital key, along with concerns around the price being highly volatile, and a lack of financial protection.\n\nWhat is the eco impact?\n\nTransactions using digital currencies might sound more straightforward \u2013 there\u2019s nothing physical to create, distribute, house\u2026 But it\u2019s the process of validating and minting coins, known as \u2018mining\u2019, that requires a monumental amount of energy. For reference, the Digiconomist\u2019s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index reports that the annual Bitcoin carbon footprint is comparable to the whole of Sweden, with a single transaction using 778 KwH (equivalent to the consumption of a typical US household over 26.67 days).\n\nAdditionally, the mining process requires special hardware for this single purpose, which is obsolete after about 18 months, contributing significantly to waste; according to Digiconomist, a single Bitcoin transaction produces 434g of e-waste, compared to 40g created by 10,000 Visa transactions.\n\nIn a closer look at the \u2018climate cost\u2019 of producing Bitcoin, a study in the journal Scientific Reports found the climate damage created was 35% of the market value generated \u2013 similar to beef at 33%. While mining isn\u2019t the only means of validating crypto transactions, it was the primary one used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the leading types, until very recently. In September 2022, Ethereum replaced the \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 mining method with \u2018proof-of-stake\u2019 in an event called \u2018the Merge\u2019, which reduced its power requirements by 99.84%! For context, that reduction is similar to the total power required for Ireland, according to the journal Patterns.\n\nSo what next? Switching to renewable energy sources to power mining would be a clear first step, or implementing carbon offsetting measures for an immediate effect. Using Ethereum\u2019s Merge as a blueprint for rolling out proof-of-stake elsewhere would be highly effective as well, but may take time due to the cost.\n\nWhile virtual transactions are looking like a reality moving forwards, it\u2019s essential that investment is made to ensure the set-up is sustainable. Cash may become a thing of the past, but we still need our virtual money to be green."

        "content": "The primary reason behind this drastic increase is said to be the introduction of Ordinals onto the Bitcoin Network\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nOver the past three months, average Bitcoin transaction fees have skyrocketed by 900%. According to a Bankless Times.com report, the average BTC transaction fees were around $1.5 on February 10, 2023. But these had jumped to $15.56 on May 10, 2023. Reportedly, the primary reason behind this drastic increase is the introduction of Ordinals onto the Bitcoin Network. Ordinals are a new integration into Bitcoin's blockchain, supporting the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and BRC-20 tokens.\n\n\"Ordinals are driving up demand for transactions and pushing up prices on the Bitcoin network. And while that's great news for miners, it isn't so for small-scale transactors. The rise in NFTs and BRC-20 is straining the blockchain due to its limited block size and scalability issues,\" said Jonathan Merry, CEO, Bankless Times.\n\nThe report stated that if this trend continues, it could lead to serious implications such as centralization of mining power due to higher profits from larger block rewards or even a decrease in overall usage of Bitcoin due to its expensive nature compared with other blockchains like Ethereum or Litecoin.\n\n\"Lowering transaction fees would improve Bitcoin's reputation and increase its use case and appeal,\" said Merry.\n\nFurthermore, the report finds that high transaction fees can put small transactors in a challenging spot since they'd be less inclined to use Bitcoin for smaller exchanges. Currently, Lightning Network works as an alternative option popular among users. Built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, the Lightning Network operates as a second layer for the Bitcoin network that allows users to process transactions more quickly and for a significantly lower fee."

        "content": "Pepe-themed Bitcoin frogs have become the most traded NFT after the Bitcoin Ordinals hype\n\nThe recently released non-fungible token (NFT) named Bitcoin Frogs, which is modeled after Frogs, has surpassed even well-known collections like Bored Apes in terms of volume traded in the last day.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoSlam, the late-February introduction of Bitcoin Frogs on Bitcoin Ordinals saw trade volume exceed US$2.2 million. 10,000 unique frog collectibles are what the collection calls itself; they were minted directly on the Bitcoin Blockchain.\n\nEach NFT was trading for 0.12 bitcoins (BTC), or more than US$3,200, at the time of writing. As of Thursday, trade commissions for buyers and sellers ranged from US$50 to more than US$1,200.\n\nThe data reveals that the trading volume of Bitcoin Frog was split over 627 distinct transactions. Bored Apes, in contrast, only logged a little more than 11 transactions, but at a far greater cost of approximately US$83,000 per NFT.\n\nSince the debut of the Ordinals Protocol earlier this year, NFTs that are issued directly on Bitcoin have become more popular. By including references to digital art in minor Bitcoin-based transactions, the Ordinals Protocol enables users to embed data onto the Bitcoin blockchain; earlier this month, the number of such Ordinals \u201cinscriptions\u201d surpassed 3 million.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) continues to struggle with overcoming the critical psychological level at $28,000, its volatility has dropped to a historically significant range, and previous chart patterns indicate a price increase could follow, although caution is necessary as this has not always been the case.\n\nAs it happens, the 60-day volatility levels of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset as of May 18 was below 40%, which is the eighth time this has happened in the last five years, according to the data shared by the cryptocurrency analytics platform IntoTheBlock in a tweet on May 18.\n\nBitcoin volatility versus price. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nWhat this means\n\nAs per the analysis, Bitcoin volatility typically \u201cremains below this level for 5 weeks and results in a 46% price gain.\u201d Having said that, the platform\u2019s team noted that there were still three crashes of around 50% that have \u201cfollowed similar conditions.\u201d\n\nIn other words, these historical patterns and their timing suggest that Bitcoin has a greater chance of getting to the price range of $39,290 in the near future than it does of dropping to as low as $13,500 \u2013 although the latter is still a possibility.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin was at the time of publication changing hands at the price of $26,912, which represents a decrease of 1.25% in the last 24 hours and 7.95% over the previous 30 days but still a 1.86% positive change across the past week, as per data retrieved on May 19.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nWhether its low volatility pattern leads toward a bullish rally or bearish slump will depend on factors other than its historical behavior on charts, including further mainstream adoption, and perceived capability to act as a hedge against financial crisis.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
