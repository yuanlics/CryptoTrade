        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls 1.3% following U.S. jobs report - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell 1.3% in the hour leading up to 9:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, to trade at US$27,369 following the U.S. jobs report release. The world\u2019s largest economy added 336,000 new jobs in September, far exceeding preliminary expectations of 170,000 and fueling concerns that interest rates will remain high over a longer period of time.\n\nBitcoin has been trading under US$30,000 since July after surging past the mark behind the series of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund applications from some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nHopes that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would greenlight a spot Bitcoin ETF have been further boosted by Grayscale Invesment\u2019s legal victory in August. The court sided with the firm in challenging the SEC\u2019s rejection of the fund manager\u2019s application to convert its Bitcoin fund into an ETF.\n\nBut this week, Ethereum-based financial products stole the show.\n\nBitwise\u2019s Ether Futures ETFs launched on Monday, along with seven other Ether ETFs from companies including Valkyrie, VanEck, ProShares and VolShares. Ether briefly rose to a weekly high of US$1,736 on Monday, before losing the US$1,700 psychological mark on the same day. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency was trading at US$1,621 as of 9:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 0.8% in the hour following the U.S. jobs report.\n\nSee related article: Valkyrie CIO expects US spot Bitcoin ETF approval in Q2 2024\n\n\u201cApproval of the recent Ether ETFs formally signals that Ether, like Bitcoin, is not a security under U.S. laws. This non-security classification will help drive increased institutional and retail investment flows,\u201d Collin Woodward, a Web3 lawyer and president of Web3 software firm StealthTest, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe first spot Bitcoin ETF [in the U.S.] is inevitable. It\u2019s just a matter of when, and that approval actually paves the way for more Ether ETFs, including an eventual spot Ether ETF,\u201c added Woodward.\n\nBitcoin also rose to a near five-week high of US$28,434 on Monday following the launch of the Ether ETFs, gaining 4.12% before falling to the US$27,500 mark on Tuesday.\n\nSee related article: NFT creators seek alternatives after OpenSea cuts royalties\n\nNext Week: Will Bitcoin prices rise during Uptober?\n\nCrypto traders often refer to the month of October as \u201cUptober,\u201d in reference to Bitcoin\u2019s strong historic performance during the month, including setting new record highs in October 2017 and 2020.\n\nNext week, the U.S. is expected to release its Consumer Price Index data for the month of September. The inflation gauge is often used by market analysts to predict the Federal Reserve\u2019s stance on interest rates.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said that confidence in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation is increasing, along with investor appetite for the asset.\n\nSee related article: CMCC Global raises US$100 mln to launch Hong Kong Web3 fund"

        "title": "Another Eye-Catching Bitcoin Forecast - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Experienced cryptocurrency investors know that there are plenty of large, not-yet-reached bitcoin forecasts floating around. The largest digital currency has been dithering in a range of $26,000 to $30,000. And mostly on the lower end for several months now. Crypto novices may find it difficult to believe Bitcoin\u2019s best days may lie ahead.\n\nThose investors might want to take heart because some crypto experts are incredibly bullish on bitcoin and if their forecasts come anywhere close to being accurate, exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) .\n\nConsider commentary from BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. In a recent interview with YouTuber Tom Bilyeu, Hayes said he believes the dominant cryptocurrency can ascend from $750,000 to $1 million in 2026. Even the low end of that range implies a nearly 27x increase from current levels. A move that if it materializes would likely bear significant fruit for SATO.\n\nHow SATO Could Benefit\n\nSATO\u2019s correlations to Bitcoin prices are well-documented. For starters, the Invesco ETF\u2019s largest holding is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Second, crypto-correlated equities make up the rest of the fund\u2019s roster. The latter point factors into Hayes\u2019s forecast because he sees favorable macroeconomic factors propelling bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI think it will be the biggest boom in financial markets we have ever seen in human history. Bitcoin will have a ridiculous price, Nasdaq will have a ridiculous price, S&P will have a ridiculous price. Pick your stock industry,\u201d he told Bilyeu.\n\nAnother point of interest for SATO investors and those evaluating the ETF is the potential for bitcoin to benefit from tighter monetary policy around the world. Hayes offered up that thesis in the interview. A view that runs counter to the dismal price action notched in 2022 by cryptocurrencies amid an avalanche of interest rate hikes by central banks around the world.\n\n\u201cAs we get to some kind of financial disturbance and people realize that real rates are negative, if governments are growing nominal at 10%, 5%, 6%, people at the market will start buying other stuff,\u201d added the BitMEX founder. \u201cCrypto is one of those things.\u201d\n\nFor investors worried that Hayes\u2019s bitcoin forecast is overly aggressive, his medium outlook is more digestible. He expects the digital currency will remain range-bound for the remainder of this year. But he added it could ascend to $70,000 next year \u2013 a more than 2.5x jump from current levels.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel.\n\nvettafi.com is owned by VettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d).

Carroll/Getty Images\n\nThe Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) paid cryptocurrency mining company Riot around $2.5 million to cut its energy use in September. The payouts come after Riot announced that it made more than $31 million in payments from the state's energy grid operator during August, as an extreme heat wave pushed the grid to multiple peak demand records.\n\n\u201cSeptember represented another significant month for Riot as we were able to clearly demonstrate the value of Bitcoin mining while contributing to the stability of the ERCOT electrical grid,\u201d Jason Les, CEO of Riot, said in a Wednesday release.\n\nRiot earned the $2.5 million in energy credits in September through ERCOT's \"demand response\" programs, which offer payouts to high-power-use entities like bitcoin mining companies to cut usage during peak demand periods. ERCOT also relies on bitcoin miners like Riot to use more power during periods of excessive supply to stabilize energy prices, according to CNBC.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Colorado-based company pulled in another $11 million in power credits in September by selling prepurchased energy to the retail energy supplier TXU, per the Dallas Morning News' Irving Mejia-Hilario."

        "title": "Dare to Dream: A Film Unveiling the Genesis of Bitcoin Beach - Nasdaq",
        "content": "In the heart of El Zonte, El Salvador, a profound transformation is underway, captivating the global Bitcoin community. Bitcoin Beach, an innovative initiative, has not only changed lives but also paved the way for El Salvador's historic Bitcoin legal tender law. The documentary \"Dare to Dream: A Story From El Salvador,\" directed by Joe Delahunty, along with producer and funder Graham Rittener, unravels the true narrative behind this groundbreaking movement, dispelling myths and showcasing the transformative power of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nOn a visit to El Zonte, Rittener was inspired by the work Bitcoin Beach and Hope House were doing to improve their community. He noticed that although there is a lot of technical and macroeconomic content, there was a gap in covering the human stories behind Bitcoin, especially regarding the rise of Bitcoin Beach. Rittener, especially saw the positive aspect that Bitcoin was having in changing people's lives. He also wanted to make the content relevant not just to Bitcoiners but to the general public as a whole through qualitative stories that they could connect with.\n\nTo that end, it was important that the film took the audience through answering the question of \"what is money?\" Here, Bitcoin philosopher and podcaster Robert Breedlove, in a friendly and accessible manner, guides the audience through this complex question.\n\nThe Genesis of Bitcoin Beach\n\n\"Dare to Dream\" illuminates the origins of Bitcoin Beach, dispelling the mystery that surrounded its inception. With meticulous precision, Delahunty traces the roots of this groundbreaking movement, unearthing untold stories that led to an unprecedented financial revolution in El Zonte.\n\nThe film vividly portrays Bitcoin's potential, surpassing mere speculation. Through intimate vignettes, we witness the profound impact of Bitcoin as a tool, liberating El Zonte from violence and despair, offering a beacon of hope, and a chance for young individuals to remain rooted in their community.\n\nAs the legal tender law gained momentum, what began as a grassroots movement got entangled in political debate. The media frenzy threatened to misrepresent Bitcoin Beach, yet at its core, the project remained steadfast, apolitical, and a testament to the enduring power of community-driven initiatives.\n\nPersonal Journeys: Hopes, Dreams, and Love for Community\n\n\"Dare to Dream\" introduces us to the individuals who birthed Bitcoin Beach, giving voice to their aspirations and love for family, community, and country. Roman Martinez (Chimbera) and Jorge Valenzuela, lifelong friends turned trailblazers, candidly share why Bitcoin became a lifeline. The film also unravels the enigmatic story of the anonymous Bitcoin funder, shedding light on how Mike Peterson, in collaboration with Chimbera and Valenzuela, turned this vision into reality.\n\nDocumentary still shot provided by Joe Delahunty.\n\nThe educational efforts by Chimbera and Valenzuela went beyond Bitcoin, equipping the community with technical knowledge to navigate Lightning Bitcoin wallets and bridging the gap for an unbanked non-technical audience, tailoring the education and wallet solutions to suit unique community needs.\n\nThe educational facet became a catalyst for holistic empowerment, extending to English language classes and diverse skill-building initiatives. Surfing, soccer, art, and drama classes emerged as strategic investments in the personal development of the community's future leaders.\n\nDocumentary still shot provided by Joe Delahunty.\n\nMultifaceted Realities: El Salvador's Bitcoin Adoption\n\n\"Dare to Dream\" features the testaments of renowned figures in the Bitcoin space, providing a unique perspective on the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin adoption. Max Keiser, who relocated to El Salvador and committed significant resources, shares some of his insights on Bitcoin adoption, while Nicolas Burtey, CEO of Galoy, emphasizes the role of Lightning as a means to empower communities. The documentary also shows podcaster John Vallis conducting interviews with locals and industry players.\n\nAdditionally, the film delves into a comprehensive exploration of how Bitcoin is integrating into the fabric of Salvadoran society. It reveals a tapestry of benefits beyond digital currency, from innovative remittance methods to a burgeoning tourism boom and merchant empowerment through reduced fees.\n\nDocumentary still shot provided by Joe Delahunty.\n\nA Beacon of Possibility\n\nWhile audiences are required to pay to view the film, it was created as a non-profit project, and if the film makes any profit, 90% of the proceeds will go directly to help the educational outreach efforts of Bitcoin Beach and Hope House.\n\n\"Dare to Dream: A Story From El Salvador\" is a powerful testament to Bitcoin's potential to bring tangible change. It transcends borders, representing a beacon of possibility for a more inclusive and prosperous world. Every Bitcoiner and anyone intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin should witness this story, for it is not just about Bitcoin but about the people, their dreams, and the hope for a better future. The film is a reminder that just as Jorge and Chimbera are changing their world, we are also encouraged to dare to dream and change ours.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: \"Dare to Dream: A Story From El Salvador\" can be streamed on Apple TV, Prime Video, YouTube Movies, Google Play, Vudu, and others in the United States; Apple TV, YouTube Movies, and Google Play in Canada; Apple TV in the Caribbean; Amazon UK in the United Kingdom; and Vimeo in all other countries. If you\u2019re outside the US, Canada, and the Caribbean, you can purchase the documentary using Bitcoin.

That would require a couple of wheels to fall off, and wheels tend to fall off in the great bubbles' unraveling, but it doesn't mean they have to. The S&P would be unlikely not to get to something close to 3,000.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"The simple arithmetic suggests you'll either have a dismal return forever, or you'll have a nice bear market and then a normal return. And the nice bear market will be hopefully less than a 50% decline, but it won't be a huge amount less than 50% from the peak in real terms.\"\n\n4. \"You increase the pressure on a very complicated system until a few things snap. That is the pattern \u2014 something breaks and nobody seems to know what it is. It's always a surprise, but you always have a surprise, so the idea of a surprise is totally unsurprising.\"\n\n5. \"My guess is we will have a recession. I don't know whether it will be fairly mild or fairly serious, but it will probably go deep into next year.\"\n\n6. \"The most vulnerable area in my opinion is the Russell 2000. It often has no collective earnings at all. It has a very high density of zombies \u2014 companies that really can only pay their interest payments by issuing more debt. They're vulnerable on the debt front, vulnerable on the financial front, and vulnerable on a broad economic front.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \"An over 40-year period of driving down mortgage rates, of course you drove up house prices all over the world, pretty much. And now the rates have gone up, of course it will drive down.\"\n\n8. \"House prices are worse for the ordinary household. They're worse for the economy than stocks because they're substantially more broadly owned. It's really an important part of the median family's income picture and capital picture. The motto should be, 'Don't mess with housing.' The super motto should be, 'Never have a housing bubble at the same time as you have a stock-market bubble.'\"\n\n9. \"Although we didn't get carried away with ridiculous subprime this time, the multiple of family income actually went higher than it did in 2007. So in terms of actual long-term vulnerability posed by overpricing, this housing market was more overpriced, and it was accompanied by a much more overpriced and classically bubbly stock market than 2007.\"\n\n10. \"Don't invest in real estate, don't invest in the US. If you have to invest in the US, quality has been the mispriced asset for 100 years. They outperform in bear markets. They underperform in bull markets, because you want to own Tesla, you want to own meme stocks, you want to own what's flying. You don't want to own Coca-Cola, it's just too boring.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. \"When it comes to quality, they have less risk of every kind. They have less debt, they go bankrupt less, they have less volatility, they have a lower beta. Yet they outperform. That is a free lunch.\"\n\n12. \"Bitcoin is, of course, an elaborate scam, really.\"\n\n13. \"Commodities break your heart because just as they're doing well, they have a wipeout for 18 months, and then they go roaring back to a new high.\"\n\n14. \"Artificial intelligence is absolutely for real. Is it big enough, soon enough to stop the deflating? No, I don't think it is. It's a 10-, 20-year, multi-decadal effect going off into the distant future, and it will be potentially vast in its effects.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. \"I'm not a great believer in economists. They've lost the plot for the last 70 years. They've forgotten their job description, which is to be useful. They drown in assumptions and closed systems, which are largely irrelevant for everything except their reputation inside their industry.\"\n\n16. \"You should not be surprised if the price of oil doesn't go over $100 maybe once or twice in the next five years. You should be amazed if the price of oil does not then have a long-term crutch, and it will run down to a level where the Saudis or somebody will be able to grind out $45 oil into the setting sun. That's how I think the game will end.\""

While its price has fluctuated dramatically, many people worry whether Bitcoin's adoption and acceptance in mainstream banking and everyday transactions are purely dependent on its price performance.\n\nThe Price Volatility of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin's path has been characterized by dramatic price fluctuations. Bitcoin's price has been a rollercoaster ride since its birth in 2009, when it was almost worthless, to its all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April 2021. This instability has drawn both ardent supporters and harsh detractors.\n\nThe Price as an Attention Driver\n\nBitcoin price increases frequently attract the attention of the media, investors, and the general public. As the price of Bitcoin rises, it makes news, attracting more participants to the cryptocurrency field. The allure of large returns has fueled speculative investment and the growth of a thriving Bitcoin trading ecosystem.\n\nValue Store Perception\n\nMany supporters claim that Bitcoin's price volatility does not detract from its attractiveness, but rather adds to it. They see Bitcoin as a digital gold-like store of value, an asset that can safeguard wealth and hedge against inflation. Price volatility is viewed as a necessary trade-off for potential long-term advantages in this setting.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nBitcoin Adoption Influencing Factors\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin is important, several additional factors influence its adoption and incorporation into established financial systems:\n\nThe regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies differs greatly across countries. Uncertainty or stringent restrictions might dissuade enterprises and investors, but a clear and supportive regulatory environment can stimulate adoption.\n\nInfrastructure Development: The availability of user-friendly wallets, exchanges, and payment systems has a significant impact on Bitcoin's usage in daily transactions. Infrastructure development is required for widespread adoption.\n\nMerchant Acceptance: Widespread acceptance as a payment mechanism by businesses can drive Bitcoin's adoption for day-to-day transactions. Companies that accept Bitcoin payments, such as Tesla and Square, have gotten a lot of attention.\n\nUse Cases Beyond Speculation: Extending Bitcoin's use cases beyond investment is critical. Projects aimed at facilitating remittances, microtransactions, and decentralized finance (DeFi) are driving Bitcoin acceptance beyond its traditional role as a store of value.\n\nTraditional financial organizations, such as banks and investment firms, are gradually incorporating cryptocurrencies into their offerings. The involvement of institutional investors, as well as the creation of Bitcoin-based financial products, show that acceptance is expanding.\n\nBeyond the Price of Bitcoin\n\nThe journey of Bitcoin extends beyond its price as it develops into a multidimensional asset and technology:\n\nBitcoin as Digital Gold: The story of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" emphasizes its potential as a store of value, particularly in uncertain economic times.\n\nSmart Contracts: Layer-2 solutions for Bitcoin, like as the Lightning Network, aim to enable smart contracts and microtransactions, expanding its utility.\n\nEnhancements to Privacy: Innovations such as the Taproot upgrade aim to strengthen Bitcoin's privacy features, making it more fungible and resistant to surveillance.\n\nConcerns about the environment: The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining has aroused debate, resulting in a growing interest in greener solutions.\n\nInteroperability: Bitcoin's compatibility with other blockchain networks, as well as its ability to span multiple ecosystems, may increase its acceptance.\n\nThe Importance of Price Stability\n\nWhile Bitcoin's price volatility has been a defining feature, obtaining price stability is frequently regarded as a critical step toward wider acceptance in everyday transactions. In this setting, stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies linked to a stable asset such as the US dollar, have gained popularity.\n\nBitcoin as a Volatile Asset: The price volatility of Bitcoin renders it unsuitable for routine transactions. Consider buying a cup of coffee with an asset that has the potential to dramatically increase or drop in value within minutes.\n\nStablecoins for Everyday Transactions: Stablecoins give the stability required for everyday transactions. They allow users to conduct cryptocurrency transactions while avoiding the price volatility associated with Bitcoin and other volatile digital assets.\n\nBitcoin as a Reserve Asset: The role of Bitcoin as a reserve asset or store of value is consistent with its digital gold narrative. It may not replace traditional currencies, but it may act as a hedge against economic insecurity.\n\nTrends in Adoption and Integration\n\nSeveral trends imply that Bitcoin's acceptability in the financial environment is growing:\n\nInstitutional Investment: Institutional players such as Grayscale, MicroStrategy, and Tesla have made significant investments in Bitcoin, indicating their belief in its long-term potential.\n\nPayment Gateways: Payment processors such as PayPal have integrated Bitcoin into their platforms, making it possible for users to buy, hold, and spend Bitcoin at millions of businesses.\n\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Some central banks are considering producing digital currencies that may be interoperable with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nGlobal Remittances: Because Bitcoin is borderless, it is an appealing option for cross-border remittances, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional ways.\n\nBitcoin ATMs: The increasing number of Bitcoin ATMs throughout the world makes it easier for anyone to buy and trade Bitcoin.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): By incorporating Bitcoin into DeFi applications, users can earn interest and access numerous financial services while keeping Bitcoin.\n\nChallenges and Threats\n\nDespite its rapid expansion, Bitcoin adoption faces a number of challenges:\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty: Evolving and sometimes contradictory regulatory frameworks might stymie Bitcoin adoption, especially in strict-regulation regions.\n\nScalability concerns with Bitcoin have resulted in sluggish transaction processing times and increased fees during moments of strong demand.\n\nSecurity Issues: Hacks, frauds, and security breaches continue to endanger cryptocurrency users and exchanges.\n\nEnvironmental Concerns: The high energy usage of Bitcoin mining has sparked controversy about its long-term viability.\n\nThe Inevitable Clash: Bitcoin vs. Central Bank Digital Currencies\n\nThe clash between Bitcoin and CBDCs is an impending showdown in the world of digital finance. CBDCs, touted for their stability and efficiency, come with a significant trade-off \u2013 a pervasive data trail. Unlike Bitcoin's pseudonymous transactions, CBDCs require users to undergo identification processes similar to those of traditional banks. This data is meticulously stored on central digital ledgers maintained by central banks, creating a comprehensive record of financial activities from cradle to grave.\n\nThis data collection raises substantial privacy concerns. Governments could gain unprecedented access to citizens' personal lives, including political affiliations and lifestyle choices, fundamentally undermining data privacy.\n\nFurthermore, CBDCs redefine ownership and control over digital currency. Unlike physical cash where individuals have full discretion, CBDC users hold digital cash in their name at central banks, with the middleman always mediating transactions. If the central bank declines a transaction, users have no recourse.\n\nCBDCs grant governments the power of programmability, allowing them to impose transaction restrictions, payment constraints, or spending limits. This newfound authority can be wielded to curtail specific purchases or block financial support for dissenting voices.\n\nIn this inevitable conflict, the concept of the \"veil of ignorance\" comes into play. It prompts us to consider not only the actions of our current governments but also those of future administrations. This introspection underscores the imminent threat CBDCs pose to global freedom, requiring us to carefully weigh the cost of innovation against individual liberties. Bitcoin, designed to be decentralized and pseudonymous, champions individual financial autonomy, making it a key player in this impending clash.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin has played an important role in fueling interest and speculation, its growth and acceptance in mainstream banking and everyday transactions are influenced by a broader set of circumstances. Bitcoin's development as an asset class, incorporation into financial systems, and maturing as a technology are all critical.\n\nStablecoins and other technologies that establish price stability can pave the road for Bitcoin's practical adoption in everyday transactions. However, its importance as a store of value, digital gold, and hedge against economic insecurity should not be overlooked.\n\nBitcoin's adoption will be dependent on a delicate combination of price stability, regulatory clarity, technological innovation, and its capacity to answer real-world financial demands as it continues to evolve and adapt to the changing financial landscape. Whatever its price, Bitcoin's journey is far from done, and its impact on the world of finance is just getting started."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price: El Salvador Crypto Advisor Predicts Explosive Rise To $220,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a recent development, Bitcoin proponent and crypto advisor to El Salvador\u2019s President Max Keiser has made a future prediction for the Bitcoin price, joining the ranks of analysts who have made bold assertions about the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s trajectory.\n\nKeiser Says Bitcoin Price To $220,000\n\nIn a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Keiser stated that the Bitcoin price will experience an explosive rise to $220,000 in the short term. However, he didn\u2019t specify how soon the crypto token would see such a rally. He made this assertion in response to a CNBC article about the current decline in the financial market amid economic and inflation concerns.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Keiser once again reiterated that Bitcoin would rise to $220,000 as he claims that \u201cCentral banks will print a wall of money visible from outer space.\u201d His belief seems to stem from the fact that many will be looking to use Bitcoin as a hedge against rising inflation.\n\nHe even alluded to the fact that the US dollar was losing its purchasing power \u201cat a very rapid pace.\u201d He gave an instance of how paying $100 for hamburgers years ago looked like a joke, but he had just spent \u201c$84 for a very ordinary hamburger.\u201d\n\nFor the longest time, Keiser has been bullish on the foremost cryptocurrency. In 2011, he called Bitcoin the \u201ccurrency of the resistance\u201d and the \u201cbiggest story of the decade.\u201d Additionally, he always touted a financial collapse as what would spark a massive rally in the Bitcoin price. Then, he stated that Bitcoin\u2019s adoption and price will increase as banks collapse.\n\nArthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, also shares similar sentiments with Keiser. He recently stated that the government would likely resort to money printing to save the bond market, which could lead to a meteoric rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC bulls struggle to maintain control | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIs Inflation Good Or Bad For Crypto?\n\nThere seem to be divergent views on how rising inflation could affect Bitcoin and the crypto market by extension. While people like Keiser and Hayes see rising inflation as bullish for Bitcoin, others like Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten believe that inflation could spell more trouble for Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to Merten, the Federal Reserve needs to keep hiking interest rates to bring down the inflation rate as there is excess money in the system due to the \u201cexcess printing of money.\u201d Meanwhile, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone warned that the rising interest rates could cause a further decline in the Bitcoin price.\n\nThere also seems to be a correlation between the stock and crypto markets. As such, it doesn\u2019t seem like Bitcoin and the crypto market exist in isolation, as any financial crisis could significantly impact it.\n\nFeatured image from The Face, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter surging above the US$28,000 level, Bitcoin traded between US$27,500 and US$27,800 this week. Factors such as a surge in the US 10-year Treasury yield by 11 basis points to reach 4.8% on Tuesday, and traders capitalizing on recent profits, led to a period of consolidation.The immediate resistance levels for Bitcoin on the upside are located around US$27,650 and subsequently US$28,000. A decisive breakthrough above the US$28,000 resistance level could trigger another bullish run. However, if Bitcoin fails to maintain its upward momentum, the next support level is positioned around US$27,400, with further support possibly at US$27,200.It's noteworthy that Bitcoin has demonstrated a remarkable year-to-date performance, surging by 65%, although it remains down by 59% from its all-time high.In parallel with Bitcoin, Ethereum closely followed a similar trajectory in its price action. Ethereum initiated an attempt at recovery, originating from the US$1,630 zone. Key resistance levels for ETH are seen at US$1,650 and then US$1,720. Failing to breach these immediate resistance levels could lead to a retracement, with the next crucial support situated at US$1,600. Despite a 66% decline from its all-time high, Ethereum has shown resilience in 2023, registering a 34% increase year-to-date.In an interesting turn of events, Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have commenced trading in the US. Diverse investment firms, including ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly, and Volshares, collectively launched a total of 9 ETFs on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), marking a significant milestone in the crypto investment landscape.Furthermore, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) has taken a proactive stance by offering guidance to cryptocurrency exchanges and issuers regarding their interim approach to what they term \"value-referenced crypto assets.\" This guidance, with a specific focus on stablecoins , provides much-needed clarity and a regulatory framework for crypto-service providers operating in Canada.Lastly, following ongoing efforts to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund, Grayscale has now revealed its intentions to pursue a similar transformation for its Ethereum product, highlighting the growing interest and demand for crypto ETFs as traditional financial institutions embrace digital assets.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing cryptos over the past week:As per prices on Friday.1. Trust Wallet Token is up by 20%2. Solana is up by 15%3. Bitcoin SV is up by 14%4. Avalanche is up by 13%5. Render is up by 13%1. Frax Share is down by 12%2. ApeCoin is down by 11%3. Pepe is down by 10%4. Compound is down by 9%5. Curve DAO Token is down by 9%(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Even as a Special Investigation Team of the Karnataka CID has stepped up the probe against Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, 29, and his associates for stealing government funds and allegedly paying state officials in cryptocurrency to cover up their crimes, a local court has kept in abeyance an SIT plea to cancel the hacker\u2019s bail.\n\nA local court in Bengaluru this week directed that a requisition made by the investigating officer of the SIT in the alleged Bitcoin scam case, seeking to cancel Srikrishna Ramesh\u2019s bail and to direct him to co-operate in the probe, be \u201ckept in abeyance\u201d until a medical evaluation for his drug addiction problem is completed.\n\nThe court said that it would consider the SIT plea for cancellation of the hacker\u2019s bail in a case of hacking multiple poker sites and cryptocurrency exchanges from 2021 \u2013 which the SIT is re-investigating on the orders of the new Congress government in the state \u2013 after the Centre for Addiction Medicine at NIMHANS Hospital medically evaluates him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SIT\u2019s move to seek cancellation of the bail comes amid a series of searches and arrests that are being conducted by the probe team. On Saturday, the probe team conducted searches at the residences of four police inspectors and a private information technology expert who were involved in the original investigation against Srikrishna and his associates in 2020 and 2021, sources said.\n\nIn an official statement, the SIT said, \u201cSpecial Investigation Team formed by government of Karnataka is investigating cases connected to laundering of bitcoins and other cases. In connection with the investigation of these cases, on 07.10.2023, multiple teams of SIT have conducted raids and searches in 9 different locations, including places belonging to 4 police officers and 2 other persons.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the searches, 4 laptops, 8 mobile phones, 2 NAS storage devices, 10 hard drives, 5 pen drives, 1 memory card and other relevant documents were seized. Investigation is continued in these cases,\u201d it added.\n\nOne of the original investigators, Sridhar Poojar, approached the high court last month against a case registered by the SIT over alleged tampering of devices seized from the hacker and his associates in 2020. The high court asked the SIT not to take any \u201caction in the absence of any incriminating material against the petitioner\u201d till October 9. On September 12, the SIT carried out searches at the homes of Srikrishna and two associates, Sunish Hegde, a contractor, and Prasidh Shetty, a close relative of Hegde.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2020, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the Bengaluru police stumbled on the suspected possession of a large quantity of Bitcoins by Srikrishna following his arrest in a case of procuring drugs over the darknet using cryptocurrency.\n\nInvestigation in the drug case led the CCB to file cases against Srikrishna and his high-profile associates for allegedly hacking online poker sites and cryptocurrency exchanges to acquire wealth through illegal means. Sriki\u2019s arrest in November 2020 in the drug case also revealed his role in a July 2019 hacking of the Karnataka government\u2019s e-procurement cell where Rs 11.5 crore was stolen.\n\nThe alleged Bitcoin scam cases involving Sriki and his associates has been at the centre of a political controversy in Karnataka with the Congress party alleging that top leaders of the state BJP and police officials received kickbacks in cryptocurrency after the arrest of the hacker and his associates in 2020 by the Bengaluru police \u2013 when the BJP was in power.\n\nOn June 30 this year, the Karnataka Police under the new Congress government set up the SIT to probe the alleged Bitcoin scam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn statements given to the police, the hacker has claimed that he gave away Bitcoins that were in his possession to the police following his arrest in 2020. \u201cI understood the case scenario that even if I do not give them the Bitcoins they can use forensic methods to find the Bitcoins after a talk with the investigating officer. So post consultations I voluntarily accepted (sic) to give away the Bitcoins which I had kept in various wallets in different cryptocurrencies,\u201d reads a statement attributed to Sriki which is a part of the chargesheet in one of the cases filed against the hacker in 2021.\n\nEarlier this week, the SIT arrested three persons \u2013 Harwinder Singh, Nithin Mesharam and Dinesh Patel \u2013 who were involved in helping the hacker gang launder the Rs 11.5 crore that was stolen from the Karnataka e-procurement portal in July 2019.\n\nThe ED had earlier filed a chargesheet regarding the laundering of the funds stolen from the e-procurement portal where a total of Rs 1.43 crore is reported to have been recovered. A special court hearing PMLA cases has issued summons to all 19 persons named by the ED in the laundering of funds.\n\nThe hacker and three associates have also approached the Karnataka High Court seeking to quash the e-procurement cell hacking case on the grounds that the investigation was conducted by a police inspector when a Superintendent of Police and Deputy Superintendent of Police are notified as officers in charge of the CID cybercrime station."

        "title": "Integrating Bitcoin into Your Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) Investment Strategy - SMSF Adviser",
        "content": "Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs) have long been a preferred choice for astute investors seeking greater control and flexibility over their retirement savings. The allure of SMSFs lies in their ability to empower individuals to shape their financial futures with autonomy and precision. For many, SMSFs represent not only a retirement nest egg but a canvas upon which they paint their financial dreams.\n\nIn recent years SMSF investors have been confronted with a paradigm shift in the investment landscape. The emergence of cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin at the forefront, has ignited a financial revolution, challenging traditional investment wisdom and beckoning SMSF trustees to explore new horizons.\n\nThe ATO's quarterly statistical report for March 2023 revealed Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) have embraced cryptocurrencies, amassing an asset allocation of over AU$1.5 billion. Trustees are now actively integrating cryptocurrencies into their investment portfolios, recognising the undeniable appeal of these digital currencies. In our ever-evolving financial landscape, it's impossible to overlook the allure of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin Diversification\n\nDiversification has long been a cornerstone of sound investment strategy, and in the context of Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs), it takes on a new dimension with the advent of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Here are some compelling advantages of considering Bitcoin as a component of your SMSF portfolio:\n\nPotential for High Returns: Bitcoin has garnered attention for its meteoric rise in value since its inception. While it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, Bitcoin has demonstrated the potential for significant returns, which can enhance the growth of your SMSF.\n\nHedge Against Traditional Markets: Bitcoin has shown a degree of independence from traditional financial markets. In times of economic turbulence or inflation concerns, Bitcoin may act as a hedge, diversifying your SMSF's risk exposure.\n\nAccess to Innovative Technology: Investing in cryptocurrencies provides exposure to innovative blockchain technology. This exposure can be particularly appealing for SMSF trustees looking to align their portfolios with technological innovation trends.\n\nGlobal Accessibility: Bitcoin is accessible 24/7, and transactions can be executed across borders without intermediaries. This global accessibility can be advantageous for SMSF investors looking to diversify beyond domestic assets.\n\nNavigating Cryptocurrency Regulations for Safe SMSF Investing\n\nWhen it comes to managing your Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF), it's essential to understand the regulatory framework, especially when considering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of your investment strategy. Here is a simplified guide to help you navigate these waters securely:\n\nRegulatory Environment Surrounding Cryptocurrencies in SMSFs:\n\nIn Australia, the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies has evolved over recent years. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) provides clear guidance on how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are taxed within SMSFs. To ensure your SMSF investment in Bitcoin is compliant:\n\nComplying with the Trust Deed and Investment Strategy: Your SMSF's trust deed must allow for cryptocurrency investments, and such investments should align with your fund's investment strategy.\n\nSole Purpose Test (SPT): This test ensures that the primary purpose of your SMSF is to provide retirement benefits to its members. Your cryptocurrency investments should align with this primary purpose.\n\nOwnership and Storage: Regulations specify how Bitcoin is owned and stored within an SMSF. The Digital Currency Exchange (DCE) account needs to be setup in the name of the SMSF, and cold storage devices need to be owned by the SMSF.\n\nImportance of Adhering to Tax and Regulatory Obligations:\n\nTax Implications: Cryptocurrency transactions within SMSFs can have tax implications, including capital gains tax (CGT) when selling cryptocurrencies. A significant advantage of a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) is the favourable tax regime it offers. SMSFs benefit from a concessional tax rate of 15%, and long-term capital gains are taxed at an effective rate of 10%. This tax rate is notably lower compared to standard individual marginal tax rates.\n\nRecord Keeping: Accurate and comprehensive record-keeping is essential. SMSF trustees should maintain records of all cryptocurrency transactions, including purchases, sales, and wallet movements, to demonstrate compliance with tax and regulatory obligations. Thankfully there are many tools available to help easily keep track of your cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nAnnual Audits: SMSFs are subject to annual audits. Cryptocurrency holdings and transactions must be transparently documented and available for audit purposes to ensure compliance.\n\nChoosing the Right Cryptocurrency Exchange\n\nIn the digital realm of cryptocurrency investments within Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs), selecting the right exchange is important. The cryptocurrency market offers a plethora of options, but not all are tailored to the unique needs of SMSF investors. Here's how you can make an informed choice:\n\nSMSF Integration: It's essential that the chosen exchange supports SMSF accounts, as these are unique to the Australian investment landscape. Many international platforms may not have the capacity to create accounts specifically tailored for SMSFs, making Australian exchanges a preferred choice for these investment vehicles. Ensuring SMSF integration simplifies the process of tracking and reporting cryptocurrency holdings within your SMSF portfolio.\n\nSecurity Measures: Security should be a paramount concern. Look for exchanges with robust security protocols, including cold storage for cryptocurrencies, two-factor authentication (2FA), and regular security audits.\n\nFees: Compare fee structures across different exchanges. Pay attention to trading fees, withdrawal fees, and any other charges that may impact the overall cost of your Bitcoin transactions. A clear understanding of the fee structure will help you manage your SMSF's costs effectively.\n\nAvailable Cryptocurrencies: While Bitcoin may be the primary focus of your SMSF, having access to a diverse range of cryptocurrencies can offer valuable diversification options. Examine the exchange's offerings and verify which cryptocurrencies are available for trading. A broader selection can provide you with flexibility to explore different investment opportunities within your SMSF.\n\nUser Experience: A user-friendly platform can significantly enhance your investment experience. Evaluate the exchange's interface for its ease of use and accessibility. Check for the availability of educational resources and support channels to assist users, particularly those new to cryptocurrency investments. A well-designed and user-centric exchange can simplify the process of managing your SMSF's cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nChoosing the right cryptocurrency exchange is a critical step in your SMSF's Bitcoin investment journey. At Digital Surge, we understand the unique requirements of Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) and have tailored our services to cater to these specific needs. Our platform is designed to provide SMSF investors with seamless access to a wide range of digital assets, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards while offering a user-friendly experience.

Here, we delve into the different approaches and underscore the importance of aligning your strategy with your SMSF's overarching financial goals.\n\nDifferent Approaches to Integrating Bitcoin:\n\nLong-Term Holding: This approach involves acquiring Bitcoin with the intention of holding it for an extended period, often years. Long-term holders believe in Bitcoin's potential to appreciate significantly over time. This strategy is typically less focused on short-term price fluctuations and more on the long-term growth of the asset.\n\nActive Trading: Active trading involves buying and selling Bitcoin with the aim of profiting from short-term price movements. Traders use various strategies, including technical analysis and market timing, to capitalize on price volatility. Active trading requires a deeper understanding of market dynamics and can be more time intensive.\n\nAligning the Investment Strategy with SMSF Goals:\n\nDefine Your Objectives: Before diving into Bitcoin investments, clearly define your SMSF's investment objectives. Are you seeking capital growth, income, or a combination of both? Understanding your goals will help shape your Bitcoin strategy.\n\nRisk Tolerance: Assess your SMSF's risk tolerance. Different strategies come with varying levels of risk. Long-term holding may be less risky but requires patience, while active trading can be riskier and demands more active management.\n\nDiversification: Consider how Bitcoin fits into your overall portfolio. Diversification across asset classes can help spread risk. Determine what percentage of your SMSF's assets you want to allocate to Bitcoin.\n\nTime Horizon: Your SMSF's time horizon plays a crucial role. If you have a long time until retirement, you may be more comfortable with a long-term holding strategy. Conversely, if you're nearing retirement, you might prefer a more conservative approach.\n\nReview and Adjust: Regularly review your strategy and its alignment with your SMSF's goals. Market conditions and your financial situation may change over time which may require adjustments to your Bitcoin investment strategy.\n\nProfessional Guidance:\n\nFinancial Advisors: Consult financial advisors who are well-versed in SMSF investments and cryptocurrencies. They can provide tailored guidance based on your SMSF's unique circumstances and goals.\n\nTax Advisors: Collaborate with tax advisors to ensure that your Bitcoin investment strategy aligns with your SMSF's tax obligations and minimises tax liabilities.\n\nDeveloping a sound Bitcoin investment strategy within your SMSF requires careful consideration of your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Whether you opt for long-term holding or active trading, the key is to stay aligned with your SMSF's overarching financial objectives and to adapt your strategy as needed to achieve those goals.\n\nKickstart your Journey to Financial Diversification\n\nReady to kickstart your journey to financial diversification?
