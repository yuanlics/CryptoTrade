        "content": "Bitcoin is an ineffective cult that not even \u201cbad guys\u201d want to join anymore, said the author of The Black Swan, a bestselling book on the extreme impact of outlier events. Cryptocurrency falls short on its claim to streamline payments, and doesn\u2019t even facilitate illegal transactions well, Nassim Taleb told Bloomberg on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even good for money laundering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is too traceable. Gold you can re-melt [into] bars, you can do something, but Bitcoin has a book entry somewhere that anyone with basic knowledge of statistics can triangularize.\u201d\n\nThe essayist assailed broader crypto culture, too, describing it as fanatical and dysfunctional.\n\n\u201cIt has transformed into a cult. The first time in history probably, we\u2019re mixing money and cults,\u201d Taleb told Bloomberg. \u201cUsually you do cults with yoga\u2026cults with music, but here is a cult with a financial product. These things don\u2019t go together well, because finance has some gravity rules that eventually end up hurting that model.\u201d\n\nHe added that crypto is a fad that falsely claims to be a refuge from regulation. Despite advertising itself as a haven from government oversight, Bitcoin is \u201cnot even attracting the bad guys anymore,\u201d according to Taleb.\n\nTaleb, a former options trader and risk analyst, has switched his stance on crypto over recent years. In 2019, he was an advocate for the currency\u2019s antiestablishment ethos. He disapproved of the Lebanese government\u2019s capital controls on banks, and lauded Bitcoin for existing outside central banking.\n\n\u201cThe most potent case for cryptocurrencies: Banks are never there when you need them,\u201d Taleb tweeted in 2019. \u201cAnd they are trying to bully the public so they avoid accountability and profit disbursements. Bankers are legal crooks.\u201d\n\nBitcoin currently trades at around $26,400, down about 12% from this time last year, and down 62% from its peak of over $68,000 in November 2021.\n\nTaleb previously invested in Bitcoin, but in 2021 he began selling his crypto because he found the currency too volatile. He also tweeted that the Bitcoin community had been taken over by \u201cCOVID-denying sociopaths with the sophistication of amoebas.\u201d\n\nEver since, the author has been vocal about his distaste for crypto and predicted its failure. On Tuesday, he compared Bitcoin to the Mafia, but said the Mafia was truer to its promise of protection than cryptocurrency.\n\nTaleb also told Bloomberg that the Federal Reserve could pull the plug on crypto at any moment, and would replace Bitcoin next month. He said this in reference to FedNow, an instant payment service the Fed plans to introduce in July. FedNow will let individuals and businesses transfer money in real time and have access to the funds within seconds, according to a video by the Fed. The service, which does not necessarily replace crypto, will be released in phases starting next month.\n\nTaleb\u2019s comments on Bloomberg came on the same day that the founders of Binance and Coinbase, the two largest crypto trading platforms, lost close to a combined $2 billion after being hit with SEC lawsuits. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong lost $361 million, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao lost $1.4 billion.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is suing Binance for alleged \u201cwash trading,\u201d when a company trades with itself to inflate volume. Meanwhile, he\u2019s suing Coinbase for allegedly selling unregistered tokens and acting as a broker, exchange, and clearinghouse without permission.\n\nTaleb took aim at Coinbase on Thursday, replying to a tweet by the trading platform claiming it is easier to deliver a bag of money by plane than by wire transfer, and that crypto is a faster solution. Taleb responded by writing that the statement was a lie \u201cmeant to fool those who don\u2019t do wire transfers.\u201d"

        "title": "JPMorgan Expects Retail Demand for Bitcoin to Remain Strong as Reward Halving Approaches - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nIn anticipation of the next halving event for Bitcoin, researchers from JPMorgan have declared their belief that the underlying asset will remain strong.\n\nAn integral component of Bitcoin\u2019s long-term viability is the cap on the volume of coins that can be mined. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and there is a gradual taper from the early days of extremely easy mining to a tiny crawl by the very end of bitcoin mining\u2019s lifespan. The mechanism for this gradual taper takes the form of the \u201chalving\u201d event, when certain passed milestones in bitcoin mined will automatically cut all mining rewards in half. In other words, the same amount of equipment and electricity will create half as many assets as it had a day before. The next halving is about a year away.\n\nThis event has happened three times in Bitcoin\u2019s past, and according to research published in June by JPMorgan, the last two halvings led to a rally in bitcoin\u2019s price. The 2024 halving seems well on track to continue this trend, as the report claims that a halving \u201cwould mechanically double bitcoin production cost to around $40,000, creating a positive psychological effect.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the increase in production cost would help raise the floor for bitcoin\u2019s valuation, and lead to an increase in demand for coins in circulation. Institutional investment has diminished somewhat, the report claims, but Ordinals and the BRC-20 protocol have been attracting lots of attention from retail investors. This endorsement of future performance is particularly interesting from JPMorgan, as the firm has historically displayed a skeptical attitude for Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the main effects the halving will have on the Bitcoin community is its radical impact on miners. With such a sheer drop in productivity, mining firms will surely struggle to maintain market viability for the sheer output of equipment and electricity. Instead, only the firms that are the most well configured to run efficiently will be able to weather the storm. When less efficient miners are pushed out of the pool, this will leave these miners able to take home a bigger proportion of the pie. In the end, the halving will be a mechanism that forces the whole industry\u2019s hardware to optimize.\n\nIndeed, to an untrained observer, it might be quite surprising that the community is full of predictions that the halving will only spell good things for Bitcoin. How could increased costs of production be good for business? The simple answer is that, because Bitcoin has already been halved many times before and \u201ctrimming the fat\u201d of mining operations has historically led to more buzz from investment, Bitcoiners are assuming the same will take place again. The difficulty in acquiring fresh bitcoin will lead to increased interest in purchasing old ones, and the mining industry will be disrupted in a way that ultimately benefits it.\n\nThe halving is expected to take place in about a year, according to current industry estimates, and there is still plenty of time to observe the trends in the market and adjust these predictions accordingly. With years of experience behind it, however, the Bitcoin community is resolute.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "This article compares the cryptocurrencies ETH and BTC, looking at their differences, pros and cons, and if they constitute good investments.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Vs. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are the two most widely-used cryptocurrencies globally. They\u2019re programmed differently, e.g., Ethereum uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while Bitcoin uses proof-of-work. This article will help you understand the differences between them.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Chart\n\nETH BTC Creator Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood Satoshi Nakamoto Launch date July 30, 2015 January 3, 2009 Market capitalization $148 billion $317 billion Supply 122 million tokens 19 million tokens Hash Rate None (doesn\u2019t rely on mining) 255MH/s Fees Varying gas fees Varying gas fees Privacy Pseudonymous Pseudonymous Consensus mechanism Proof-of-stake Proof-of-work Block time 10 to 19 seconds 10 minutes Future token issuance Maximum of 18 million new tokens every year Maximum supply of 21 million tokens All-time high $4,811.39 $67,598.09\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating on a blockchain. The blockchain is a public ledger that records all transactions on the Bitcoin network. Anyone with a Bitcoin wallet address can send tokens to another address or receive tokens from another address. Bitcoin was conceptualized and created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a person whose real identity remains unknown. The first block for Bitcoin was created in January 2009, and the first reported real-world financial transaction using Bitcoin took place in May 2010 when a Florida man paid 10,000 BTC for two boxes of pizzas. As of its first reported transaction, one Bitcoin was worth roughly a fourth of a cent. A few years after, millions of people began adopting the token, and demand shot up, driving the price of a single Bitcoin to an all-time high of over $67,000 in 2021. However, the 2022 crypto market crash has seen the price of Bitcoin slump to just over $16,000.\n\nPros And Cons Of Investing In Ethereum\n\nPros Supports global transactions with fast speeds\n\nSupports global transactions with fast speeds Zero network downtime over the past few years\n\nZero network downtime over the past few years Decentralized digital currency Cons Highly volatile\n\nHighly volatile Transaction fees can be high depending on network demand\n\nTransaction fees can be high depending on network demand No maximum supply, so there\u2019s a high risk of inflation\n\nETH Vs. BTC: Similarities And Differences\n\nSimilarities Both tokens have high demand and a very liquid market.\n\nBoth are decentralized tokens operating on a public ledger (blockchain).\n\nBoth tokens have millions of users globally.\n\nBoth use alphanumeric strings as wallet addresses and are tradable on crypto exchanges. Differences ETH uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while BTC uses proof-of-work.\n\nBTC has a maximum supply, while ETH doesn\u2019t.\n\nBTC relies on mining, while ETH doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain processes transactions significantly faster than the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Price\n\nBTC has historically had a much higher market capitalization than Ethereum. Both cryptocurrencies peaked in 2021, a bubbly year for digital assets, but in 2022 have plunged from their all-time highs.\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum Fees\n\nEvery Bitcoin transaction includes a gas fee paid to the miners on the network validating the transaction. Likewise, every Ethereum transaction includes gas fees paid to the network\u2019s validators. These fees are separate from what exchanges and brokerages charge to facilitate transactions.\n\nETH BTC Gas Fee: The minimum number of tokens necessary to execute a transaction, and it varies based on network demand. You can offer additional tips so that validators will prioritize your transaction. Gas Fee: The amount paid to the blockchain to execute a transaction. It varies based on network demand.\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum Privacy\n\nUsing a decentralized exchange, you can purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum without giving up your identity. In contrast, centralized exchanges have know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, so users must provide some form of identity. Yet, even when you use a decentralized exchange, both Ethereum and Bitcoin aren\u2019t fully anonymous, as someone may be able to tie your wallet address to your real-world identity via a platform you transact with.\n\nWhat Is Proof Of Work (POW) Vs. Proof-Of-Stake (POS)? Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are the most popular mechanisms for validating transactions on a blockchain, but they work differently. Proof of Work Proof of Stake Relies on miners whose capacity depends on computational power Relies on stakers whose validating capacity depends on the amount of tokens they stake Miners receive block rewards Stakers receive transaction fees as rewards Requires expensive mining equipment and high energy usage Doesn\u2019t require expensive equipment or high energy usage The proof-of-work mechanism uses a competitive validation method (solving complex mathematical puzzles) to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain, while proof of stake uses validators selected at random to confirm transactions and add new blocks. Bitcoin operates on the proof-of-work mechanism, while Ethereum operates on the proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nBTC Vs. ETH Use Cases\n\nYou can use BTC and ETH for different types of transactions or as a store of value.\n\nTop BTC Use Cases\n\nStore of value : You can use BTC as an alternative currency to store your assets.\n\n: You can use BTC as an alternative currency to store your assets.

Dapps: You can use BTC to transact on various decentralized apps, e.g., games and gambling apps.\n\nTop ETH Use Cases\n\nStore of value : You can also use ETH as a store of value and a hedge against inflation from your local currency, but a stablecoin better fits this purpose.\n\n: You can also use ETH as a store of value and a hedge against inflation from your local currency, but a stablecoin better fits this purpose. Staking : You can stake your ETH on the Ethereum blockchain to earn a percentage of transaction fees paid to the network.\n\n: You can stake your ETH on the Ethereum blockchain to earn a percentage of transaction fees paid to the network. NFTs : You can use ETH to buy non-fungible tokens (ETH) on various platforms.\n\n: You can use ETH to buy non-fungible tokens (ETH) on various platforms. Lending: You can lend your ETH to other users and earn interest via a lending protocol.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Long-Term: Which Is A Better Investment?\n\nETH and BTC can be good long-term investments that\u2019ll yield profits. Yet, be sure to perform your own due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency. This article isn\u2019t investment advice.\n\nA Case For Investing In ETH\n\nETH is one of the most traded cryptocurrencies globally. Anyone getting into the crypto markets as a newbie has likely heard of ETH, so may be compelled to buy it. The Ethereum network offers very fast transaction processing speeds compared to many other cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s volatile but not as volatile as most altcoins. The token\u2019s recent shift from the proof-of-work mechanism to proof of stake has attracted more users and increased its demand.\n\nAs of late 2022, the crypto market is experiencing a widespread rout that has the value of many tokens to plunge, including ETH. If you believe the market is headed for recovery, it\u2019ll be a smart decision to invest in ETH.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nThe token is vulnerable to massive price swings.\n\nTransaction fees can be very high when there\u2019s significant demand on the network.\n\nMany smart contract platforms are emerging to compete with Ethereum, so its appeal might fade.\n\nCrypto wallets and exchanges where you hold ETH are vulnerable to hacking attacks.\n\nA Case For Investing In BTC\n\nBTC is the cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization. The demand for BTC is enormous across the globe, so there\u2019s always the chance of it increasing in value. Lately, institutional investors have set their sights on the cryptocurrency markets, and BTC is the asset most of them buy. BTC is already huge, yet there\u2019s significant potential for growth in its demand, meaning it could be a good long-term investment.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nBTC is significantly volatile.\n\nBTC is vulnerable to a 51% attack \u2014 a group of miners controlling more than 50% of the network\u2019s mining power can connive to disrupt it.\n\n\u2014 a group of miners controlling more than of the network\u2019s mining power can connive to disrupt it. There\u2019s no central authority to retrieve your BTC if you fall victim to hacking.\n\nGovernments may decide to ban or restrict the use of Bitcoin if it\u2019s affecting their national currencies.\n\nRemember that investing comes with risks. Hence, it\u2019s wise to only invest money that you can forfeit without losing much sleep. Always do your own research before investing, and remember that this article doesn\u2019t constitute investment advice.\n\nBest Cryptocurrency Exchanges To Buy ETH\n\nCoinbase: Best For Ease Of Use\n\nBest For Ease Of Use Binance: Best For Low Fees\n\nBest For Low Fees Uniswap: Best For DeFi Users\n\n1.

        "content": "The Justice Department is accusing two Russian nationals of being behind the headline-grabbing hack of Mt. Gox, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange from 2010 to 2013.\n\nOn Friday, the DOJ unsealed charges filed in 2019 against 43-year-old Alexey Bilyuchenko and 29-year-old Aleksandr Verner, accusing the two of stealing 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox and using it to underpin the illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e from 2011 to 2017.\n\nBilyuchenko is also being charged for running BTC-e with Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national extradited to the U.S. last August after a 2017 arrest in Greece. Vinnik is accused of laundering more than $4 billion of criminal proceeds through BTC-e.\n\nBilyuchenko and Verner are facing conspiracy to commit money laundering charges while Bilyuchenko is facing accusations of money laundering, conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money services business.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite said Bilyuchenko helped set up BTC-e in part to launder the funds that were stolen from Mt. Gox \u2014 an assessment others investigating the case have made previously.\n\n\u201cFor years, Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators allegedly operated a digital currency exchange that enabled criminals around the world \u2014 including computer hackers, ransomware actors, narcotics rings, and corrupt public officials \u2014 to launder billions of dollars,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey.\n\nCourt documents unsealed in the Southern District of New York accuse Bilyuchenko, Verner and unnamed co-conspirators of hacking into the Japan-based computer servers holding the cryptocurrency wallets used by Mt. Gox customers.\n\nThe suspects transferred the funds from Mt. Gox\u2019s wallets to bitcoin addresses controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner and others, prosecutors said.\n\nThe Justice Department said the group siphoned the 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox between September 2011 and May 2014, effectively wiping out the platform\u2019s holdings of that currency. The platform shut down in 2014.\n\nIn April 2012, the group allegedly struck a deal with an unnamed bitcoin brokerage service to liquidate the stolen currency in exchange for large wire transfers to several offshore bank accounts.\n\nBetween March 2012 and April 2013, the brokerage transferred about $6.6 million to overseas bank accounts controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators.\n\nIn return, the brokerage got \u201ccredit\u201d on another crypto platform controlled by the group. Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly laundered more than 300,000 bitcoin stolen from Mt. Gox on this unnamed crypto exchange.\n\nFor years, former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles faced accusations that he was behind the theft and collapse of the platform.\n\nBTC-e laundering\n\nIn charges unsealed in the Northern District of California, Bilyuchenko is accused of working with Vinnik and others to run BTC-e until it was shut down by law enforcement in July 2017.\n\nBTC-e was a hotbed for criminal activity according to the Justice Department, serving as \u201cone of the primary ways by which cyber criminals around the world transferred, laundered, and stored the criminal proceeds of their illegal activities.\u201d\n\nThe platform allegedly served more than one million users worldwide \u2013 helping launder the proceeds of \u201cnumerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware events, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs alleged, Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner thought they could outsmart the law by using sophisticated hacks to steal and launder massive amounts of cryptocurrency, a novel technology at the time, but the charges unsealed demonstrate our ability to tenaciously pursue these alleged criminals, no matter how complex their schemes, until they are brought to justice,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York."

        "content": "Bitcoin prices rose in Friday morning trading in Asia, but failed to break back above US$27,000 after a rollercoaster week in crypto markets following the lawsuits by U.S. securities regulators against the Binance and Coinbase exchanges. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies gained, with Polygon\u2019s Matic token leading the winners.\n\nTop 10 gain ground\n\nBitcoin strengthened 1.06% over the last 24 hours to US$26,551 at 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, making up some losses from earlier this week after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against two of the world\u2019s biggest exchanges, alleging dozens of of crypto tokens have been illegally offered and traded as unregistered securities. The world\u2019s largest crypto by market capitalization is now down 1.26% for the past seven days after sharper declines earlier in the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEther climbed 1.1% to US$1,849, and logged a 0.98% weekly decline.\n\nPolygon\u2019s MATIC was the biggest gainer among the top 10, with a 2.69% rise, but it has lost 12.02% in value for the past week.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB added 2.01% in the past 24 hours, the second-largest rise among the top 10, but is a big loser for the week, down 13.9%.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap edged up 0.35% to US$1.1 trillion in the 24 hours through to 8:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, while daily trading volume dropped 35.3% to US$25.9 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nIn a new court filing on Wednesday, the SEC said transactions involving several billions of dollars of customer funds moved through now-defunct Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank under accounts allegedly controlled by Binance officials, including chief executive Changpeng Zhao.\n\nSachin Verma, an accountant employed by the SEC, said in the filing that some of the funds were moved to accounts suspected to belong to offshore firms linked to Zhao and Binance, in various regions including the Seychelles, Lithuania and Kazakhstan.\n\nStory continues\n\nZhao tweeted on Thursday that this is \u201csimply false\u201d in response to a CoinDesk article that said US$12 billion of funds was sent to Zhao, citing the Wednesday filing.\n\n\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, Binance.US had in total roughly US$2 billion in user funds. This number in USD equivalent fluctuates a little as crypto prices change. And declining as users withdraw due to recent news,\u201d Zhao tweeted. \u201cAll user funds are accounted for, and never left the Binance.US platform (unless users withdraw themselves of course), ever.\u201d\n\nGordon Grant, co-head of trading at crypto brokerage Genesis Trading, said that this week\u2019s sweeping regulatory pronouncements \u201csaw crypto realized volatility begin to rear its head.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter seeming months of coiling in an ornery, reptilian rip-rap price action, the successive Monday and Tuesday swoon-soar tandem on the back of Binance and Coinbase headlines preempted consternation, head scratching and, if nothing else, a recognition that the asset class remains habitually prone to lurid gaps in price action,\u201d Grant said.\n\nIn an email, Le Shi, head of trading at Auros, a crypto market-making and algorithmic trading firm, said cryptocurrency trading volumes continue to \u201cplumb the depths\u201d last seen in the middle of the last crypto bear market.\n\nCoinShares, a European crypto investment firm, said in a Thursday report shared with Forkast that while the SEC lawsuits seem to carry more severe implications for Binance, the potential impact on Coinbase and the broader crypto industry is significant.\n\n\u201cThe charges insinuate that a majority of crypto assets should be categorized as securities, which would radically modify the regulatory landscape, potentially confining access to regulated Wall Street entities (assuming that they have the appetite once the litigation is over),\u201d CoinShares wrote.\n\nCoinShares added that the shift could potentially place the control of the crypto industry within the grasp of traditional financial institutions.\n\nNFT sales drop\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 1.07% to 3,219.65 in the 24 hours to 9:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index was down 4.59% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum fell 14.4% over the last 24 hours to US$13.72 million, and sales on the Bitcoin network dropped 9.34% to US$3.53 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s a] hard market to analyze right now,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, said on Friday.\n\n\u201cOn one hand I believe we\u2019ll see capitulation to the negative news, especially once the SEC files lawsuits against (NFT) projects, but at the same time, we are seeing bullish news from projects, art, among others, on an almost daily basis,\u201d Petscher added. \u201cI don\u2019t think the SEC\u2019s lawsuits have played a factor yet. They should soon.\u201d\n\nUncategorized Ordinals \u2013 recently popular Bitcoin Ordinals that are not part of an established collection \u2013 saw the largest sales in the past 24 hours with a 74.13% rise to US$1.54 million.\n\nThe Captainz, an Ethereum-based collection, recorded a 2.33% increase in sales to US$1.12 million, making it the second most sold collection in the past day, followed by Mythos chain-based DMarket\u2019s US$1.11 million daily sales.\n\nIn another development, crypto exchange Kraken has launched its NFT marketplace out of beta with over 250 collections.\n\nLuca Netz, the chief executive officer of intellectual property firm and NFT collection Pudgy Penguins, is set to launch a Web 3.0 licensing marketplace named Overpass as early as late June, according to a Thursday report by media firm NFT Now.\n\nPudgy Penguins is an Ethereum-based NFT collection of 8,888 unique digital assets. It is the 19th largest collection in all-time sales, with more than US$257 million traded, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nU.S. stock futures fall\n\nNew York Stock Exchange. Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 10:10 a.m. in Hong Kong after the major U.S. stock indexes posted strong gains overnight. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 0.14%, and S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1%. Nasdaq Futures fell 0.1%.\n\nOvernight in the U.S., the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.02%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5%. The S&P 500 added 0.62%, hitting a new high for the year so far.\n\nIn macroeconomic developments, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday that the country\u2019s initial jobless claims totaled 261,000 for the week ended June 3. That was the highest weekly level for such claims since October 30, 2021.\n\nThe jobless claims pointing to a slowing of the economy are another factor suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s more than year-long hikes in interest rates are having an effect and may influence the Fed\u2019s decision-making on rates at its meeting on June 14.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 74.8% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged at next week\u2019s meeting, and a 25.2% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: SEC crackdown on Binance, Coinbase \u2018can\u2019t stop\u2019 Bitcoin as it trades above US$26,000 - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell 2% from June 2 to June 9 to trade at US$26,598 at 7:45 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has traded below US$30,000 since April 19. Ether fell 2.83% over the week to US$1,842.\n\nIt was a tumultuous week for the crypto industry after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance\u2019s U.S. wing for 13 charges related to securities violations, including the unregistered offers and sales of the BNB and BUSD tokens and activity related to its Simple Earn and staking programs.\n\nThe SEC sued Coinbase exchange on Tuesday, a day after initiating its lawsuit against Binance. The regulator alleged that Coinbase made billions of dollars unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities since at least 2019.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the SEC is currently on the hunt for crypto companies. This goes back to the collapse of FTX in 2022, as U.S. regulators would embarrass themselves if a similar scenario were to repeat itself without intervention,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast in a LinkedIn response.\n\n\u201cIt is very likely that more exchanges will be targeted in the coming months. However, going for the big dogs like Binance and Coinbase first seems strategically clever as smaller companies will automatically adapt their activities to the new rules indicated by the outcome of the lawsuits.\u201d\n\nFollowing the lawsuits, Bitcoin briefly dipped to a weekly low of US$25,493 on Tuesday but recovered above US$26,000 the same day.\n\n\u201cThe rapid recovery of crypto prices is due to two reasons. First, lawsuits can\u2019t stop decentralized systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum and therefore do not pose a direct threat to cryptocurrencies. Second, even though the U.S. is an influential global player, these lawsuits should have little impact on other jurisdictions around the world. While holders of U.S. cryptocurrencies sold their shares in a short-lived market panic, many took the opportunity to buy cryptocurrencies at a discount, thus the market quickly recovered,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nJames Wo, the founder and chief executive officer of crypto investment firm DFG, said that market confidence did not take a significant hit from the lawsuits, unlike the panic selling caused by FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\n\u201cIf it falls below US$26,000 again this week, it could be considered a short-term downtrend. Another price to watch is the previous high of US$28,000-28,500. Its break-through can be seen as a short-term bullish signal,\u201d wrote Wo to Forkast.\n\nLucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, said that the SEC\u2019s crackdown occurred given its failure to prevent the FTX collapse and warned of the potential of a more aggressive approach by the regulator.\n\n\u201cIt remains unclear if more exchanges will be targeted in this crackdown. However, it is evident that the SEC is taking a more aggressive approach towards regulating the crypto industry, which may result in more legal actions against other exchanges that fail to comply with securities laws,\u201d Kiely told Forkast.\n\nKiely added that the market\u2019s quick recovery occurred as buyers saw an opportunity to buy the dip.\n\n\u201cSome analysts believe that this is a sign of growing maturity in the cryptocurrency market. In previous years, negative news from regulatory bodies would have caused more significant price drops.\u201d\n\nAdding to global investor concerns, the Eurozone economy officially entered recession as it shrank 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to preliminary estimates of a 0.1% growth, pressured by high inflation and borrowing costs.\n\nMike Ermolaev, founder of blockchain PR firm Outset PR and the author of the interview series \u2018Crypto Opinion with Mike Ermolaev,\u2019 said that a bull run could occur if the SEC loses the lawsuits.\n\n\u201c[The SEC\u2019s actions] appear to be an attempt to cripple the sector, especially in light of the new lawsuit against Coinbase. While cryptocurrency will undoubtedly recover, the road to redemption will be more challenging than ever. Moreover, we must not discount the possibility that unfair regulations could drive crypto into the shadows, taking a significant step backward,\u201d wrote Ermolaev to Forkast.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.1 trillion on Friday at 7:45 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 3.5% from US$1.14 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$515 billion, Bitcoin represented 46.7% of the market while Ether, valued at US$221 billion, accounted for 20%.\n\nSee related article: It\u2019s a fight for the future of money in the US, says Christopher Giancarlo\n\nNotable Movers: LUNC, XRP\n\nTerra\u2019s Luna Classic (LUNC) token was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer in the top 100. LUNC rose 15.27% to US$0.00009811. The token started picking up momentum on Sunday, a day before proposal #11548 passed, which will provide a test environment for the price re-pegging of USTC.\n\nXRP, the cryptocurrency powering the XRP Ledger\u2019s real-time gross settlements, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer. XRP rose 2.3% to US$0.5274, as investors became less concerned with Ripple\u2019s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC after the regulator filed two similar lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nSee related article: Why the US is waging war on Binance, Coinbase\n\nNext Week: Can Bitcoin stay above US$25,350?\n\nInvestors await the release of May\u2019s core Consumer Price Index in the U.S., scheduled for next Tuesday. The inflation data will be published a day before the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest rate decision on Wednesday, where the Fed is expected to pause its interest rate hikes for the first time in over a year, according to over 90% of economists polled by Reuters.\n\nEuropean investors are anticipating the European Central Bank\u2019s next monetary decision, set for next Thursday. Following seven consecutive rate hikes, the bank is expected to hike its key lending rate by 25 basis points, even as higher borrowing costs start to take a toll on the European economy.\n\nA weekly close above US$27,600 in Bitcoin would signal more uptrend, while a close below US$25,350 means more bearish momentum, Johnny Louey, a crypto research analyst at trading platform LiquidityTech Protocol told Forkast in a Telegram message.\n\nYield App\u2019s Kiely said that he only expects significant upward momentum after a close above US$30,500.\n\n\u201cMultiple closes above this number and we could be at the onset of a new bull market. It could trade in the mid-term as low as US$24,000. If it breaks that level, it could continue to trade downwards,\u201c wrote Kiely.\n\nSee related article: What\u2019s next for crypto miners after US debt ceiling deal?"

        "title": "Bullish on Bitcoin? This Skyrocketing Stock Is a Screaming Buy - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) mining stocks have seen a huge rally this year, largely on the strength of Bitcoin's market-topping performance in the crypto market. Bitcoin is now up 60% year to date, and Bitcoin mining stocks are up even more. Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%), for example, is up about 215% for the year.\n\nThe big question for investors, of course, is whether this rally has legs. Even after Riot Platforms reported better-than-expected numbers in May, its stock price still fell by 13%. Much of that has to do with Bitcoin's recent inability to break through the $30,000 price level, which has investors concerned that the crypto's sizzling performance to start the year may be coming to an end.\n\nRiot and the price of Bitcoin\n\nLong story short, Bitcoin mining stocks tend to move up and down with Bitcoin. This makes perfect sense because the core business activity of any Bitcoin miner is, well, mining Bitcoin. The more Bitcoin a company mines, the more money it makes. And the higher the price of Bitcoin goes, the more valuable each Bitcoin it mines becomes. It's not rocket science.\n\nIf you're a long-term buy-and-hold investor, though, this well-known correlation makes investing in Bitcoin mining stocks very problematic. It means that you will be tempted to sell during low points of the Bitcoin market and buy during high points of the Bitcoin market. This is exactly the opposite of a buy-low, sell-high strategy, and highlights the perils of trying to time markets.\n\nImpact of the Bitcoin halving\n\nInvestors are keeping a close eye on the next Bitcoin halving, now scheduled for April 2024. Halvings take place only once every four years and are one of the most anticipated events in the Bitcoin community, primarily due to a past history of significant price gains that have accompanied every halving event since 2012.\n\nIn a halving, the reward for mining a new block of Bitcoin falls by half. Thus, in April 2024, the reward for mining new coins will drop from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins. On the surface, this would seem to be a negative development for Bitcoin miners. It means they will be expending the same amount of energy but getting a smaller reward, right?\n\nHowever, if you take into account the price appreciation in Bitcoin that can occur both before and after a halving, then this effect is largely negated. There have now been three past Bitcoin halvings (in 2012, 2016, and 2020), and each one has seen monster price appreciation for Bitcoin. In 2020, for example, the price of Bitcoin exploded by 688% after the halving.\n\nAlthough there is some debate about whether this historical cycle will repeat in 2024, there are plenty of analysts and investors who think it will, so it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. By some estimates, the price of Bitcoin could blow through its all-time high of $68,790 and move toward $100,000 -- if not higher. And that would be tremendous news for Riot. Even though the company will be earning less Bitcoin next year, each new Bitcoin might become much more valuable.\n\nIs Riot a good long-term investment?\n\nIn the short run, then, Riot would seem to be an attractive investment target. But what about in the long run? From my perspective, there are two variables to consider here.\n\nThe first variable is whether Riot Platforms can remain a best-in-class Bitcoin miner. Based on what we know about Riot's current mining capacity and willingness to take on new Bitcoin mining infrastructure, this looks very favorable. Dating back to the start of 2022, Riot has mined the second-highest number of Bitcoins in the industry. And it has done so with a lower cost basis than its rivals.\n\nThe other variable is whether Riot can diversify its core business so that it is not so cyclical. Riot is never going to be a stock you can buy and forget about until it is more diversified. There's good news on this front. In January, the company changed its name from Riot Blockchain to Riot Platforms as a way to signal to the market that the company has future plans to diversify. Some have suggested that Riot could find other uses for its high-performance computer facilities, including artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.\n\nUntil this happens, the decision of whether to invest in Riot is still just a decision of where you think the market for Bitcoin is headed. Personally, I think the market for Bitcoin is headed higher in 2023 and early 2024, primarily due to the upcoming halving event. From my perspective, that makes Riot a screaming buy for the next 12 months."

        "content": "The US federal government has charged two Russian nationals in connection with the series of hacks that brought down the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange in 2014. In a press release on Friday, the Department of Justice announced it\u2019s unsealing a 2019 indictment charging (PDF) Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner with conspiring to launder 647,000 Bitcoins stolen from the exchange, which was worth around $400 million at the time.\n\nThe government is separately charging Bilyuchenko for working with Alexander Vinnik \u2014 who the DOJ indicted in 2017 before he was extradited to the US last fall \u2014 for operating BTC-e, a now-defunct crypto exchange that served as \u201cone of the primary ways by which cyber criminals around the world transferred, laundered, and stored the criminal proceeds of their illegal activities.\u201d\n\nAt the time of Vinnik\u2019s indictment, the government alleged that stolen funds from Mt. Gox passed through BTC-e and wallets associated with Vinnik. Now the DOJ alleges that Bilyuchenko, Verner, and other co-conspirators laundered over 300,000 Bitcoins that had been stolen from Mt. Gox as well.\n\nMt. Gox owner and CEO Mark Karpeles was arrested in 2015 and indicted in Japan on charges including embezzlement and aggravated breach of trust. But in 2019, Karpeles was acquitted on most of them, with a suspended sentence applied for falsifying data. Today he retweeted a post linking to the unsealed indictment.\n\n\u201cAs alleged in the indictments, starting in 2011, Bilyuchenko and Verner stole a massive amount of cryptocurrency from Mt. Gox, contributing to the exchange\u2019s ultimate insolvency,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. says in a statement. \u201cArmed with the ill-gotten gains from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko allegedly went on to help set up the notorious BTC-e virtual currency exchange, which laundered funds for cyber criminals worldwide.\u201d\n\nWhile Bilyuchenko faces charges with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money services business and over 20 years behind bars, Verner is charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering with a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison."

        "content": "Bitcoin might have displayed strength by quickly recovering from the $25,500 support level on June 6, but that doesn\u2019t mean that breaking above $27,500 will be an easy task.\n\nInvestors still expect stricter regulatory scrutiny after FTX\u2019s bankruptcy in November 2022, including the recent suits against Coinbase and Binance.\n\nA total of eight cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions have been undertaken by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the past six months. Some analysts suggested the SEC is attempting to redeem itself for failing to police FTX by taking action against the two leading exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, looking at a wider angle, investors fear that a global recession is imminent, which limits the upside of risk-on assets such as stocks, cryptocurrencies and emerging markets.\n\nThe eurozone entered a recession in the first quarter of this year, according to revised estimates from the region\u2019s statistics office, Eurostat, released June 8. Poor economic performance might limit the European Central Bank\u2019s ability to further increase interest rates to tackle inflation.\n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, said the U.S. is seeing stubbornly high inflation along with elevated real interest rates. Dalio warned of an excess debt offer amid a shortage of buyers, which is especially concerning since the U.S. government is desperate to raise cash after the debt ceiling was hit.\n\nRecent macroeconomic data has been mostly negative, especially after China announced a 4.5% decline in imports year over year on June 6. Furthermore, Japan posted a 0.3% quarter-over-quarter contraction in gross domestic product on June 7.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned amid the weaker global environment.\n\nBitcoin margin and futures favor bullish momentum\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin-lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase their exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin-lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin-lending ratio spiked on June 5 after Bitcoin crashed by 7% to $25,500. Those traders were likely caught by surprise, as the indicator reached an impressive 62 favoring longs, which is highly unusual and unsustainable.\n\nThe OKX margin-lending ratio adjusted to 34 on June 6, as leveraged longs were forced to reduce their exposure and additional margin was likely deposited.\n\nInvestors should also analyze the Bitcoin futures long-to-short metric, as it excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nBoth OKX\u2019s and Binance\u2019s top traders reduced their long-to-short ratios between June 7 and June 8, indicating a lack of confidence. More precisely, the ratio for OKX top traders declined to 0.78 on June 8 after peaking at 1.08 on June 7. Meanwhile, at crypto exchange Binance, the long-to-short ratio declined to 1.29 on June 8 from 1.35 on the previous day.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin rebound falters amid SEC crackdown on exchanges, raising chance of a BTC price capitulation\n\nOverall, Bitcoin bulls seem to be in a bad place, both from the worsening regulatory crypto environment and the unfolding global economic crisis.\n\nBitcoin derivatives markets indicate a low probability of the BTC price breaking above $27,500 in the short to medium term. In other words, Bitcoin\u2019s market structure is bearish, so a $25,500 support retest is the most probable outcome.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

They can also opt to receive funds as cash or bitcoin. Bitcoin payments can be made directly on-chain or via the Bitcoin Lightning Network \u2013 a second layer payment system for cheaper and faster bitcoin transactions.\n\nDeposit limits have been increased and on-chain payments are now tiered, allowing users to pay higher fees for faster payments and lower fees for slower, less urgent transactions.\n\nThe 29-year-old says his company has \u201csome serious ambitions\u201d in the long-term.\n\n\u201cGlobal on/off ramps, instant withdrawals, new DCA [dollar cost averaging] capabilities, continuing to improve our limits, more cross-currency capabilities, and more things we hope to bring soon,\u201d Mallers said."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) may be in line for a 60% upside if a long-term chart feature stays intact.\n\nIn part of his latest analysis on June 8, popular trader Mikybull Crypto flagged encouraging signs on the BTC/USD weekly chart.\n\nWeekly Bitcoin price chart keeps $40,000 on the table\n\nWith Bitcoin still wedged in a narrow trading range it entered almost three months ago, market participants have little to go on when it comes to short-term price targets.\n\nDay-to-day performance has offered no decisive trend up or down, and $30,000 remains formidable resistance overhead.\n\n\u201cThe market is still in the same position it has been the past few days. Don't get chopped up, place some bids at the extremes and wait,\u201d trader Jelle suggested in advice now typical of the current market perspective.\n\n\u201cStay focussed on the higher timeframe direction.\u201d\n\nFor Mikybull Crypto, however, those higher timeframes point to some much more interesting price action around the corner.\n\nThe weekly chart, he argued, shows BTC/USD completing and now retesting an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.\n\nThis is the bullish counterpart to the standard head-and-shoulders pattern, which shows resistance being cemented and is typically followed by downside.\n\nWhile daily timeframes have seen a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern materialize around April\u2019s $31,000 local highs, the broader trend may yet play out in bulls\u2019 favor.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is flashing a text book inverse head and shoulders on the weekly TF. Price is currently retesting the Neckline after the breakout,\u201d Mikybull Crypto explained.\n\n\u201cAs taught, if the range between the head and neckline is usually the sprint, we are anticipating another 60% rally on BTC.\u201d\n\nThat 60% \u201csprint\u201d would place BTC/USD at around $40,000.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price lost steam after a failed retest of the $27,400 resistance on June 6, signaling that investors became less confident after the recent regulatory actions by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance and Coinbase. Both exchanges are being sued on multiple counts, including failure to register as licensed brokers and offering unregistered securities.\n\nThe SEC might have a difficult case ahead\n\nAccording to Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith, the SEC is trying to circumvent formal rulemaking processes and deny public engagement. Meanwhile, Insider Intelligence crypto analyst Will Paige said the SEC\u2019s intent is to police the space through enforcement in the absence of a regulatory framework.\n\nThose criticisms explain why investors may be clinging to their hopes in the U.S. Financial Services Committee hearing scheduled for June 13.\n\nThe potential overreach of the SEC has caused ripples multiple times, including in the U.S. legislature. Sen. Bill Hagerty, for instance, stated that regulators at the SEC are \u201cweaponizing their role\u201d and publicly called out SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.\n\nThe @SECGov is weaponizing their role to kill an industry. Allowing a company to list publicly and then stonewalling their attempts to register is indefensible. @GaryGensler, expect to hear from Congress.https://t.co/GdprSW1Yns \u2014 Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) June 6, 2023\n\nFurther supporting the thesis that the cryptocurrency space can function without crypto-banks, as the centralized exchanges are commonly known, is the sudden increase in decentralized finance volumes.\n\nThe median trading volume across the top three decentralized exchanges (DEXs) jumped 444% between June 5 and June 7. As DEX volumes surged, net outflows on Binance reached $778 million, the difference between the value of assets entering and exiting the exchange.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has been trying to reclaim the $27,000 support, but that might be harder than expected given the upcoming $670 million weekly options expiry on June 9.\n\nBulls have been caught by surprise with the negative newsflow\n\nIt is worth noting that the actual open interest for the June 9 expiry will be lower since bulls concentrated their wagers above $27,000. These traders got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin\u2019s price gained 9% between May 25 and May 29, testing the $28,000 resistance.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 9. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 0.63 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $410 million in call (buy) open interest and the $260 million in put (sell) options. However, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $26,500 at 8:00 am UTC on June 9, only $38 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nRelated: US District Court issues summons for Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao over SEC action\n\nBitcoin bears aim for sub-$26,000 to increase their payout\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on June 9 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price.\n\nThe imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $25,000 and $26,000: 100 calls vs. 5,100 puts.

The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $80 million. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 8,700 calls vs. 700 puts. The net result favors call (bull) instruments by $225 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the put options used in bearish bets and the call options exclusively in neutral-to-bullish trades. This oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin longs using futures contracts were liquidated to the tune of $100 million on June 5, bulls might have less margin required to try pumping the BTC price above the $27,000 mark. Consequently, bears seem closer to scoring a decent profit on Friday\u2019s options expiry.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The extreme dominance of US entities in 2020-21 has clearly reversed, with US supply dominance falling by 11% since mid-2022,\u201d Glassnode researchers commented.\n\n\u201cEuropean markets have been fairly neutral over the last year, whilst a significant increase in supply dominance is visible across Asian trading hours.\u201d\n\nBitcoin regional Year-over-Year Supply Change annotated chart.

        "content": "As many developments within the space show how far the Bitcoin (BTC) community has come, an executive from a BTC payments provider shared how in other parts of the world, adoption may still be in its early stages.\n\nAt the BTC Prague event, Cointelegraph reporter Joseph Hall interviewed Ethan Rose, founder of Pouch \u2014 a wallet service that supports the Bitcoin Lightning Network in the Philippines. The duo spoke about the state of adoption in the country and how the Pouch team is trying to introduce Bitcoin to merchants on the island of Boracay, a popular tourist hotspot in the country.\n\nAccording to Rose, their team has already managed to onboard around 250 businesses within the island and 400 businesses in the country. Their team is working to promote Bitcoin adoption in the country by offering merchants another way to attract customers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not really hard sold on Bitcoin. They\u2019re not like they haven\u2019t decided to spend the rest of their life stacking SATs. Right? So, our pitch is more like a way to just attract new customers to your business over the long term,\u201d Rose said.\n\nCointelegraph reporter Joseph Hall with Pouch founder Ethan Rose at BTC Prague. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nApart from this, the executive also shared that there are still some difficulties in introducing Bitcoin to people. He explained:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to orange-pill. If you can just like walk up to somebody and convince them to like that Bitcoin is the best money and they just decide on the fly to switch their mental model of what money is, like right there. I would say that\u2019s a pretty gullible person.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the challenge of introducing Bitcoin to people, the executive also shared that, as more businesses start to accept Bitcoin, there are also risks of them not getting any sales from it.\n\nLocal eatery in the Philippines accepting Bitcoin. Source: Pouch\n\n\u201cWe need more spenders,\u201d he explained. The executive said there\u2019s a risk that businesses would not have a good experience because spenders could get diluted if many stores accept Bitcoin in a single area.\n\nRelated: The Philippines delays publishing crypto framework\n\nIn addition, Rose reiterated that it\u2019s crucial for businesses to have a good experience when they accept Bitcoin. The executive explained that merchants could potentially end up just abandoning the endeavor if it doesn\u2019t bear any fruits. \u201cIf nobody shows up after a couple of months, they just like, uninstall their wallet,\u201d he added.\n\nMagazine: Tornado Cash 2.0: The race to build safe and legal coin mixers"

There are ways to pay with crypto at even more merchants. However, by using a third-party service that converts your crypto to fiat to complete the transaction.\n\nCrypto cards that convert cryptocurrencies into fiat in order to complete a purchase may incur a taxable event. Since you are technically selling your crypto and buying fiat, you could be subject to capital gains tax if your crypto has appreciated since you initially purchased it. Converting stablecoins such as USDC or USDT into fiat does not incur this tax liability because these stablecoins are equal to a dollar in value.\n\nCrypto Debit Cards\n\nVisa and Mastercard, the two largest payment processors, have partnered with several of the most popular crypto companies to provide crypto debit cards. These cards are accepted anywhere that regular Visa and Mastercard cards are accepted \u2014 meaning you can use your crypto debit card just like a traditional debit card.\n\nCard Provider Card Type Rewards Rate Best For Coinbase Card Visa Debit Up to 4% cashback Low fees Crypto.com Card Visa Debit 1% to 5% cashback in CRO token CRO holders Binance Card Visa Debit Up to 8% cashback in BNB token EU residents BitPay Card Mastercard Debit Varies by merchant Frequent shoppers Gemini Card Mastercard Credit 3% back on dining, 2% back on groceries, 1% back on everything else Traditional Crypto Credit Cards Nexo Card Mastercard Credit Up to 2% cashback in NEXO token Collateralized-Loan Crypto Credit Cards\n\nVisa Crypto Cards\n\nCoinbase Visa Card: The Visa card from Coinbase lets you spend your Coinbase crypto balance anywhere Visa is accepted.

Instead, you can use your crypto to purchase gift cards to your favorite stores.\n\nPurchase gift cards from thousands of retailers using crypto here:\n\nShould You Pay With Crypto?\n\nWhether merchants support crypto or not, you can use crypto debit cards, credit cards, and gift cards to spend crypto almost anywhere. It\u2019s important, however, to weigh the benefits and downsides of spending your crypto on everyday purchases and decide if it\u2019s for you.\n\nCrypto allows for anonymous transacting, but keep in mind that many companies are required by law to verify your identity. So while crypto payments are well-supported in general, spending your crypto anonymously may be harder.\n\nPaying with crypto can be a good idea when you have a large crypto balance that you want to put to work or if you need a transaction to clear quickly.\n\nCrypto payments can incur tax bills, however, and you might miss out on future price pumps.\n\nPros And Cons Of Paying With Crypto\n\nPros Spend in a currency of your choice\n\nSpend in a currency of your choice Earn rewards\n\nEarn rewards Enjoy instant payment settlement Cons You might have to pay taxes on converted crypto\n\nYou might have to pay taxes on converted crypto Extra fees\n\nExtra fees You can miss out on gains\n\nPros Explained\n\nSpend in a currency of your choice: Whether you hold lots of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or Ethereum, it\u2019s nice to spend your crypto without converting it first.

        "content": "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said that Russian nationals Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner were responsible for hacking now defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox in 2011, laundering bitcoin from the hack, and operating an illicit crypto exchange of their own.\n\nKey Takeaways DOJ alleges that Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner laundered bitcoin linked to the infamous Mt. Gox hack.\n\nThe funds were allegedly used to establish another exchange called BTC-e, which gained popularity among criminal networks.\n\nThe DOJ alleges that the accused engaged in fraudulent contracts with a New York-based bitcoin broker to launder the stolen bitcoins.\n\nMt. Gox collapsed in 2014, leaving users with substantial financial losses and ongoing uncertainty regarding the distribution of remaining assets from the Mt. Gox estate. The charges may lead to the recovery of more funds for Mt. Gox's victims.\n\nLaundering the Proceeds from the Mt. Gox Hack\n\nIn September 2011, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their accomplices allegedly accessed the server hosting the cryptocurrency wallets of Mt. Gox, by far the largest bitcoin exchange at the time. With unauthorized access, they allegedly transferred bitcoins from Mt. Gox's wallets to their own controlled bitcoin addresses.\n\nOver the span of approximately three years, from September 2011 to May 2014, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators are said to have stolen around 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox. The stolen bitcoins were allegedly laundered through bitcoin addresses associated with accounts controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their accomplices on two other online bitcoin exchanges, as well as through a specific user account on Mt. Gox itself.\n\n\n\nThe DOJ's allegations also suggest that the accused individuals engaged in fraudulent contracts with a New York-based bitcoin broker to launder the stolen bitcoins originating from Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in 2014, resulting in significant financial losses for numerous users who are still waiting for the distribution of the remaining assets from the Mt. Gox estate.\n\n\n\nAnother Russian national, Alexander Vinnik, was previously charged with operating BTC-e in 2017."

        "title": "Hodling pays off for patient Bitcoin investors with 1000x returns - DLNews",
        "content": "Analysis from Unchained Capital shows investors holding BTC for more than five years did not lose money.\n\nBitcoin halving triggers bull and bear cycles and predictable patterns in volatile asset.\n\nThe hodlrs are right after all.\n\nFor all the ups and downs in Bitcoin\u2019s price one constant prevails \u2014 it consistently delivers net gains to investors who hold, or hodl in crypto parlance, the token for at least five years, according to analysis by Unchained Capital, a financial services firm.\n\nPatient investors multiplied their returns 1,000 times on a mean-adjusted basis over six to seven years, Unchained Capital said in a report entitled \u201cHODL Cave\u201d and released this week. The study also found that no investors who held BTC five years lost money.\n\nIn contrast, the mean return for investors holding BTC for two years could multiply 23 times but there was a slim chance they might lose half their initial investment.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cFor bitcoin detractors, this massive historical appreciation in value is the hardest fact about Bitcoin to explain away,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors, who analysed BTC returns over a 13-year period.\n\nThe power of halving\n\nAt first glance, it may seem obvious that holding an asset for a long time will eventually pay off. Yet unlike most other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin automatically regulates its scarcity in a way that directly impacts its valuation. It\u2019s called halving, and it has provided a key means for investors to anticipate the bull and bear cycles in Bitcoin.\n\nHardcoded into Bitcoin by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, halving reduces the number of newly minted tokens by 50% every four years. This means miners tending the Bitcoin blockchain must compete for fewer tokens as a reward for their efforts. It also means the price of Bitcoin predictably goes up as supply diminishes.\n\nNOW READ: Arbitrum just came to a sudden halt \u2014 it ran out of money for gas\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nThroughout its history, the price of Bitcoin has set a new all-time high between 12 and 18 months after each halving event. The last halving was in 2020 and the next one will happen in 2024. Over the last three years, Bitcoin has swung from a low of $5,000 to an all-time high of about $65,000, and settled back again to $26,434, which is where it was trading on Thursday.\n\nAs a result, halving has become a trigger for a bull market in Bitcoin and in the crypto market as a whole given the token\u2019s dominance. Bitcoin accounts for 44.7% of the cryptocurrency market\u2019s total capitalisation, according to CoinGecko.\n\nHodling becomes a thing\n\nEven so, Bitcoin has crashed after every all-time high. This decline is then followed by a choppy period of sideways price action that gives way to another bull run after the next halving.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin may be a white knuckle ride, but now, with more than a decade of data to examine, a clear pattern is emerging that may embolden even more hodling.\n\nHodling has become a badge of honour among investors who sit on their positions even when it looks like the bottom is falling out of the market.\n\nHodling became a thing back in 2013 when GameKyuubi, the pseudonymous member of the Bitcointalk forum, coined the term as a deliberate typographical error. \u201cI am hodling,\u201d he said in December 2013.\n\nNow hodling has become a badge of honour among investors who sit on their positions even when it looks like the bottom is falling out of the market, as it did last November when FTX failed and Bitcoin lost more than a quarter of its value in four days.\n\nNOW READ: How Coinbase\u2019s SEC woes clobber its earnings outlook\n\nFunny enough, GameKyuubi is promoting the same idea long championed by Warren Buffett, the billionaire investing legend, who has long advised buying the S&P 500 Index and holding it forever.\n\nBut of course, being a short-term investor in Bitcoin is a very different trip than holding the top 500 stocks in the US. Investors who bought BTC in 2021 have had to stomach a vertiginous risk-reward ratio as the market is whipsawed by regulatory action against Coinbase, Binance, and Genesis. Still, BTC is up 59% this year.\n\nBuy and forget\n\nUnchained Capital\u2019s analysts also weighed the human factor in their report. The simple fact is that investors who sit on their positions for longer time-frames tend to become less likely to sell. They get comfortable hodling BTC the same way Buffett is comfy sitting on his stocks decade after decade.\n\n\u201cThe biggest reason that exiting a decade-long bitcoin position for massive returns is a fantasy is that investors who have actually held bitcoin for a decade or more no longer think about exiting Bitcoin,\u201d the authors said.\n\nCall it inertia or buy-and-forget or hodling. Whatever the label, the data show the approach delivers for investors who play the long game.\n\nHave tips about Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies? Contact the author at osato@dlnews.com."

        "content": "After a period of relative calm, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) kicked off its summer crypto crackdown by targeting two major exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.\n\nA total of 13 charges have been filed against Binance. One of the allegations in the suit claims that funds from Binance and Binance.US were commingled into an account controlled by the Changpeng Zhao-associated company, Merit Peak.\n\nAs for Coinbase, the SEC claims it has been offering unregistered securities and was never registered as a broker, securities exchange or clearing agency. Many in the crypto industry have been puzzled by the allegations against Coinbase, primarily because it is a publicly-traded company and received a previous green light from the regulator.\n\nWhile not surprising, this week\u2019s developments again shed light on the dubious practices of the SEC toward the crypto space, as it claimed companies failed to register with the regulator, despite the absence of a path to do so. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the latest string of lawsuits is an attempt by the SEC to \u201cdistract\u201d from the agency\u2019s \u201cFTX debacle\u201d Let\u2019s not forget the SEC has not sued FTX, although it has charged its founder and former executives.\n\nThe crypto space has seen sell-offs in tokens and stocks, services halted and heightened uncertainty in recent days, but these events may also bring something that the industry is eager for \u2014 legal clarity.\n\nAlong with the recent wave of lawsuits, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Apple\u2019s new headset moving beyond the metaverse, Brazil\u2019s Mercado Bitcoin gets the green light for its fintech payments arm, and how European Union regulators are targeting fake news generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nSEC complaint hints at why Brian Brooks resigned as Binance\u200b.US CEO\n\nThe SEC\u2019s latest complaint against Binance could explain why former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks chose to step down in August 2021, only three months after his appointment. According to legal sources, the complaint cites an \u201cunnamed source\u201d who ran Binance.US for a brief period in 2021. The dates correlate with the time that Brooks was CEO of the company. Brooks \u2014 a former top banking regulator \u2014 led operations at the crypto exchange after replacing former CEO Catherine Coley. According to comments cited in the complaint, Brooks quickly realized that he was \u201cnot actually the one running this company.\u201d Upon recognizing this, he decided to leave, announcing his resignation just three months later.\n\n1/ The SEC complaint against @Binance appears to solve the mystery of why Brian Brooks abruptly resigned as CEO of @BinanceUS in 2021.\n\n\n\nCZ allegedly reneged on promises that Brooks would be given autonomy to run https://t.co/reBq6K7KAs independently from @Binance. \u2014 MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) June 5, 2023\n\nBrazilian crypto exchange Mercado Bitcoin licensed as payment provider\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Mercado Bitcoin was granted a payment provider license from Brazil\u2019s central bank on June 2. With the license, the company will launch its fintech solution MB Pay. The fintech arm will provide Brazilian users with specific digital banking services using crypto assets held on the exchange, such as digital fixed-income investments, staking and other financial transactions. A debit card offering a crypto off-ramp for users is expected to go live soon. Global crypto exchanges operating in Brazil\u2019s market include Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com and Bitso.\n\nApple\u2019s Vision Pro headset reveal swaps metaverse for \u2018spatial computing\u2019\n\nApple\u2019s newly revealed mixed-reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, has turned tech-enthusiast heads in the past few days. The company, however, deliberately labeled its technology the first \u201cspatial computer\u201d to move away from the metaverse concept and differentiate its virtual reality tool from competitors. Apple\u2019s marketing is focused on the words \u201cspatial\u201d and \u201cspatial computing\u201d rather than words such as \u201cmetaverse,\u201d \u201cAR,\u201d and \u201cVR.\u201d A clear step away from Microsoft\u2019s Hololens and Meta\u2019s headsets. Apple\u2019s headset will be launched in the U.S. in early 2024, for a hefty retail price of $3,499, before expanding internationally.\n\nUsing apps with Apple Vision Pro.

According to EU officials, companies deploying generative AI tools should label their content to combat fake news. The statement comes as the EU prepares its forthcoming Artificial Intelligence Act, which will be a comprehensive set of guidelines for the public use of AI and the companies deploying it.

        "title": "Shattering the Illusion: Bitcoin's Limitations as a Currency - Worldline",
        "content": "There is a fascinating story, taking place during World War II, inside a concentration camp, built by German forces, for Western prisoners of war. This gripping tale explains the reason and the way a currency is created, the rules that govern its transactions and the needs that shape them. At the same time, the story explains, in simple words, some economic terms like arbitrage, default and equilibrium, using a few packets of cigarettes, some grams of coffee and a few chocolate bars. It is a story told in chapter 7 of the book \u201cTalking to my Daughter\u201d by Y.Varoufakis. Yet you may ask \u2013 how does this link to Bitcoin's Limitations as a Currency?\n\nLet's take a moment to get a clear picture of the difference between money and currency, so we can put any misunderstandings to rest once and for all! Money, my friends, is the intangible stuff that's all about numbers, while currency is the physical money you can hold in your hands - you know, coins and paper notes. Now that we've got that sorted out, let's look back to the war story. Aside from the main lesson of that chapter, which is that money cannot be kept separate from the state, the author goes on to argue (after a supply of quite a lot Red Cross packages) that the fixed quantity of Bitcoins, their scarcity, raises two important issues: firstly, a deflationary effect (Bitcoin is deflationary by design due to its limited supply) and secondly, as a result of the first, the impossibility of reflating the economy by increasing its quantity. The author has also, using this specific chapter to make his point, highlighted that Bitcoin is definitely not the answer to the question \u201cWhat is money, really?\u201d\n\nStaying for a while on the deflationary question, there are opposite voices through time, either arguing between price and supply deflation or highlighting that Bitcoin is designed to experience predictable and low inflation rates. In fact, it is worth mentioning that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins. This hard-set limit (that can be modified only with a change to the Bitcoin code and a general consensus of the Bitcoin community) creates a sense of ingrained value, and it was the result of a well-thought-out process when figuring out the right supply-and-demand dynamics at the launch of the Bitcoin project. It was intended to mimic the characteristics of a scarce asset like gold, diamonds or even art.\n\nIn other words, this limited supply is intended to increase the value of each individual bitcoin over time, as demand for the cryptocurrency grows but the supply remains relatively fixed. In contrast, fiat currencies are often vulnerable to inflation due to their reliance on central banks or monetary authorities for issuance and regulation. These governing bodies possess the authority to manipulate monetary policies, including the control of money supply and interest rates. When expansive monetary policies are implemented, such as the injection of additional currency into circulation, the value of the currency can gradually diminish over time. This ongoing increase in the money supply can erode its purchasing power and undermine the stability of fiat currencies.\n\nHowever, this deflationary nature of Bitcoin can also be a double-edged sword. While it can increase the value of individual Bitcoins over time, it can also lead to hoarding and a reluctance to spend the currency, as people may believe that its value will continue to rise in the future. This can hinder the adoption of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, as people are less willing to spend their currency if they believe it will be worth more in the future.\n\nThere are even inherently incorporated disinflationary measures inside Bitcoin (like \u201chalving\u201d which, every four years, reduces the number of Bitcoins that can be mined and enter into circulation). The truth is that:\n\nAlready 19,306,581 Bitcoins (or 92% of the total supply) have been produced so far (according to coinmarketcap.com on 3 rd March 2023)\n\nMarch 2023) A large amount of bitcoins (around 20-23%) are lost forever, mostly due to the loss of private keys\n\nThe last new bitcoin will be generated around the year 2140\n\nThe design intention was that, as the overall supply of Bitcoin decreases, the market value of the currency increases, and its purchasing power goes up. The truth is that the success and stability of Bitcoin's value are subject to market dynamics, regulatory developments, and mostly investor sentiment. Bitcoin's volatility and the lack of intrinsic value make its long-term success as a widely recognized and stable asset quite uncertain. Based on the above, there is no reason to believe that Bitcoin is something that will replace money and there is no reason we should treat Bitcoin as such.\n\nBut let's try to take a less harsh view and take a closer look at what needs to be in place for something to be recognized as \"money\". Economists around the world agree that money has three basic functions: as a unit of account, as an acceptable medium of exchange and as a store of value. It should also be able to be used as a means for deferred payment.\n\nBitcoin does not sufficiently provide even one of these functions!\n\nIt performs poorly as a unit of account \u2013 that is: it is not a standard, widespread measurement for value, with prices of goods and services denominated in that currency. The (relatively few) merchants around the world that accept Bitcoins, invariably list their products\u2019 prices in the national currency of the country in which they are based (the volatility of Bitcoin would dramatically impact their prices, otherwise).\n\nBitcoin is also not widely used as an independent unit of account for other currencies to be measured with (while Bitcoin has gained some acceptance as a unit of account in certain circles, it is certainly not widely used in this way today).\n\nBitcoin has a very restricted use as a medium of exchange \u2013 money exists to make transactions possible, and this may be achieved only when it is accepted by buyers and sellers to pay debts or financial obligations.\n\nAlthough more and more sellers are accepting Bitcoin, the reality is that they are doing so more from a marketing/publicity perspective, and this trend is most likely to be halted once the Bitcoin price enters (again) bear market territory.\n\nTrust is also at the core of any system of money. Bitcoin\u2019s trust challenge lies in the fact that not many people are filled with confidence by its overall image \u2014 its sense of insecurity (not being backed by a Central Bank or a Government), its volatility, the constant threat of the regulator. Having all these in mind, we may conclude the poor function of Bitcoin as means for deferred payment\n\nAnd with this statement, we return to the final function of money: the store of value. According to Karl Schumpeter, one of the greatest economists of all time, along with Maynard Keynes & Milton Friedman, in his book published in 1930 \"A Treatise on Money\", the store of value can be defined as \u201c\u2026the will to possess something precious now\u2026and in the future\u201d, which brings us back to the Bitcoin\u2019s volatility issue.\n\nAccording to Bankrate, \"Bitcoin's price history: 2009 to 2023\": \u201cBitcoin\u2019s price has been on a roller coaster ride since it first debuted in January 2009, but the long-term trajectory has been higher \u2013 \u2018up and to the right,\u2019 as they say.\u201d Even, at the time of writing, and so far, this year, bitcoin has a change of 42,03% (according to coindesk.com on 27th February 2023). The extreme volatility of Bitcoin is mostly attributed to it not being intrinsically valuable: there is nothing that is backing up its value, other than feelings and projections.\n\nWhy, then, should you consider Bitcoin as a viable replacement for traditional money? After careful examination, it is clear that Bitcoin falls short of being a true form of money. While it boasts precise accounting facilitated by digital specificity through cryptography and is often hailed as a digital store of value, it is unrealistic to expect Bitcoin to fully supplant money in a vast and diverse economy. While it may find utility in certain scenarios, Bitcoin's limitations and its fundamental divergence from the characteristics of traditional money suggest that widespread adoption as a complete substitute remains unlikely.\n\nRead my next article about Bitcoin\u2019s Future: The Great Deception and the Real Promise\n\nThe opinions and ideas expressed here are my own and I would be happy to discuss them - contact me at Makis.Malioris@worldline.com"

        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs: What are Bitcoin Ordinals? - Milk Road",
        "content": "So you might have heard about NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. They\u2019re basically like digital trading cards that you can buy and sell. They live entirely on the blockchain. Some popular NFT collections include the CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club. While most NFTs are on the ETH blockchain, Bitcoin NFTs are now making their way mainstream. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: NFTs exist on different blockchains. Most NFTs are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This is because the technology that powers NFTs uses \u201csmart contracts,\u201d an innovation that first became available on Ethereum in 2015.\n\nSome other chains like Solana also have their own NFTs, but Ethereum has been the largest blockchain that allows for NFTs\u2026 until now.\n\nToday, you can purchase NFTs on Bitcoin. That\u2019s right, the original blockchain (and the most popular cryptocurrency project) now supports NFTs. Bitcoin NFTs work quite differently from those on other chains \u2014 in fact, they\u2019re only possible because of an update that was introduced to the Bitcoin codebase in 2021.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros Allow you to buy and sell NFTs using the Bitcoin network\n\nAllow you to buy and sell NFTs using the Bitcoin network Can store more than just images \u2014 audio and video files can also be Bitcoin NFTs\n\nCan store more than just images \u2014 audio and video files can also be Bitcoin NFTs Cheaper to create than NFTs on Ethereum Cons Departs from the original concept of Bitcoin as a payments-only platform\n\nDeparts from the original concept of Bitcoin as a payments-only platform Can \u201cclog up\u201d the blockchain and reduce fees awarded to miners\n\nCan \u201cclog up\u201d the blockchain and reduce fees awarded to miners Concept still new and unexplored\n\nHow Do Bitcoin NFTs Work?\n\nSo here\u2019s the deal: Most blockchains get updated regularly for security and expansion purposes. Bitcoin received an upgrade (codenamed \u201cTaproot\u201d) in November 2021 that made it easy to store large amounts of data on the Bitcoin blockchain. This was meant as a future-proof upgrade in order to help Bitcoin stuff more data into every block.\n\nSome enterprising programmers, however, realized they could use this upgrade to store entire files on the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 thus creating Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals NFTs\n\nThe Ordinals protocol is where the rubber meets the road on Bitcoin NFTs. The basic gist (with as little technical mumbo jumbo as possible) is that Ordinals allows you to \u201cinscribe\u201d a tiny amount of Bitcoin with a unique ID that lets you track that particular digital asset around.\n\nIn fact, you can go to the Ordinals website today and see the latest \u201cinscriptions\u201d (or NFTs) that people have created on Bitcoin. These range from profile-picture-style NFTs to messages to time travelers, memes, and even an audio file of Elon Musk talking about the teachings of Jesus. Someone even created a playable videogame as a Bitcoin NFT.\n\nPretty cool stuff, right?\n\nHow To Buy Bitcoin Ordinals\n\nStep 1: Choose The Right Wallet.\n\nYou will need a wallet to store the Bitcoin Ordinals that you want to purchase. Examples of wallets that support it include the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro Wallet, and Xverse. We\u2019ll use the Ordinals Wallet for this example.\n\nStep 2: Set Up Your Wallet.\n\nYou need to set up your wallet on whichever platform you pick. Select a unique password for it, and you\u2019ll be assigned a seed phrase that lets you recover your wallet in case you forget the password.\n\nStep 3: Deposit Funds Into Your Wallet.\n\nSend BTC tokens to the address of your wallet, which you\u2019ll use to pay for the Ordinals.\n\nStep 4: Buy The Ordinals.\n\nOnce your funds have been deposited, you can browse through the Ordinals collections and select the one you wish to purchase. Pay for it (including NFT royalty fees if they apply) and it\u2019ll be added to your wallet. The process is similar regardless of what wallet provider you choose.\n\nTop Bitcoin Ordinal Projects\n\nTwelveFold TwelveFold is a collection of 300 generative art pieces inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain, with each piece representing a complete art project. This Ordinals project was created by Yuga Labs, the company behind the famous Bored Ape Yacht Club collection and the APE token. Because of the limited number of pieces and the clout of Yuga Labs, the TwelveFold collection has the potential to appreciate in the future.\n\nBitcoin Rocks Bitcoin Rocks is a limited collection of 100 art pieces inscribed onto satoshis on the blockchain. Each piece pays homage to the early days of crypto collectibles and NFTs. This is one of the most popular Ordinals projects, and the limited collection gives it the potential to appreciate in the future. Note that the lowest bid one can currently make is 2.7BTC, which represents over $60,000.\n\nTimechain Collectibles Timechain Collectibles is a collection of 21 exclusive Ordinals that showcase different types of timepieces, including pocket watches, ancient watches, clock towers, and more. All the pieces are minted into a single block and have consecutive Inscription numbers from 356-377. Some pieces are rarer than others and thus more expensive. Auctions are held on the project\u2019s Discord channel, with fierce bidding because of the exclusiveness.\n\nWhat Are People Saying About Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nPeople are split on whether Bitcoin NFTs are a good thing. Below are some tweets highlighting different viewpoints on this contentious question.\n\nOne of the benefits of Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs is they allow you to store much more data than you can on Ethereum. In the above thread, famous crypto personality Eric Wall explains how he used an Ordinals NFT to create the largest Bitcoin transaction (by data size) the network had seen in seven years. And he paid just $20 in fees to do it. In comparison, to store an NFT this large on Ethereum would have cost close to $140 \u2014 a 7x difference.\n\nSecuring the Bitcoin blockchain requires \u201cmining.\u201d This is cost-intensive, so the network rewards miners by giving them Bitcoin. Each time a new block is mined, 6.25 Bitcoins are generated and awarded to miners.\n\nEach block, however, gets harder to mine. There are concerns that Bitcoin will soon reach a point where it is not properly incentivizing miners to keep paying the enormous costs to mine new blocks. In response to this, some are saying that finding more Bitcoin use cases \u2014 such as Bitcoin NFTs \u2014 will help revitalize the Bitcoin ecosystem and solve this looming problem.\n\nOrdinals are an attack on #Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nIt's being orchestrated by known bad actors. \u2014 Derek Ross \u26a1\u26d3\ufe0f (@derekmross) February 2, 2023\n\nIt\u2019s generally accepted that Bitcoin was intended to be a payments-only blockchain. Bitcoin \u201cmaximalists,\u201d who believe Bitcoin should stick as closely as possible to its original purpose, are skeptical of Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nTo them, these projects pollute the Bitcoin ecosystem, using up valuable space on the blockchain. In addition, Bitcoin maximalists bring up an important point about Bitcoin NFTs \u2014 they greatly reduce the fees miners collect for their work.\n\nSince the image and video files of Bitcoin NFTs take up so much space, each \u201cblock\u201d of the Bitcoin blockchain is composed of fewer and fewer transactions. Fees are normally charged per transaction, so the fewer transactions there are, the fewer fees are collected. This could spell doom for the Bitcoin ecosystem if it cannot incentivize miners to keep the blockchain running.\n\nInterested in more NFT news? Check out our list of top NFT newsletters to stay in the loop.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nBitcoin NFTs bring the important innovation of tradeable digital assets to the very first blockchain to ever exist. While not everyone agrees this is necessarily a good idea, there are positives and negatives to it, and, most importantly, anyone can decide for themselves if they want to use Bitcoin NFTs or not.\n\nContributor George Hristov George is a tech writer interested in web3 startups and communities.

        "title": "Bitcoin holds as market reacts to SEC drama - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "3\u20136-month BTC holders join day and swing traders in sell-offs amidst SEC drama.\n\nBitcoin sees minimal realized loss as it maintains its support range of $25,000 and $26,000.\n\nThe recent drama involving two major exchanges and certain tokens in the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) suit has caused quite a stir, even though Bitcoin (BTC) itself was not directly involved. Nevertheless, Bitcoin\u2019s response to this news has been noteworthy.\n\nRead Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAs a result of these developments, certain groups of holders have chosen to sell their holdings. However, it is crucial to explore how this news and the actions of these holders have impacted other important metrics and the current market price of BTC.\n\nBitcoin witnesses some Long-term Holders dump\n\nThe recent developments surrounding Binance and Coinbase have had a noticeable impact on the price of Bitcoin (BTC), leading to a correction. Analyses of CryptoQuant\u2019s recent charts revealed that the sell-off volume of BTC was primarily influenced by day traders, swing traders, and some long-term holders.\n\nA closer examination of the Exchange Inflow Spent Output Age Bands provided interesting insights. On June 4, there was a modest increase in BTC inflow within the 0\u20131-day age band, with over 14,000 BTC entering the exchanges. This move was a regular occurrence based on historical data.\n\nHowever, June 5 witnessed a significant spike in the inflow from long-term holders in the three to six-month age band. This sudden surge saw over 3,000 BTC deposited, indicating an uncommon sell-off by this particular category of long-term holders.\n\nOn the other hand, the six and 12-month holders seemed relatively calm in their sales. But June 7 saw an unprecedented flow of over 1,000 BTC, marking the highest level since March. These observations suggested that short-term holders were the primary drivers behind the recent fluctuations in BTC\u2019s price. Long-term holders have generally held onto their coins.\n\nFurthermore, the Exchange Inflow \u2013 Spent Output Value Bands shed light on the volume of Bitcoin sold by various traders, ranging from 1 to 10,000 BTC over the past 13 months.\n\nBitcoin realized losses stay minimal\n\nAs U.S. regulatory pressure intensified on major cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, the market witnessed a surge of high volatility, leading to substantial price swings. Despite these turbulent movements, recent data from Glassnode\u2019s chart revealed that the total Bitcoin Realized Losses recorded On-Chain amounted to a relatively modest $112 million.\n\nInterestingly, this figure represented a significant deviation of -$3.05 billion (-96.5%) from the largest recorded capitulation event. These findings suggested that market participants have displayed heightened resilience in the face of these regulatory challenges.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nCurrent support level maintained\n\nOn a daily timeframe chart, Bitcoin\u2019s price movement revealed a noteworthy trend that began on June 4. During this period, Bitcoin experienced substantial price fluctuations.\n\nHowever, it managed to sustain its support range, hovering around $26,000 to $25,000. As of this writing, BTC was trading at approximately $26,500, indicating a slight increase and suggesting a modest gain in value."

        "title": "Mysterious Bitcoin Wallet Comes to Life After Nine Years - Tekedia",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, there are many mysteries and surprises. One of them is the phenomenon of dormant bitcoin wallets that suddenly become active after years of inactivity. These wallets contain large amounts of bitcoins that have been untouched for a long time, sometimes since the early days of bitcoin when the coins were worth very little.\n\nOne such wallet recently came to life after nine years of dormancy. The wallet contains 616 BTC, which is worth more than $40 million at the current market price. The wallet dates back to around the time that bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto was last active online and has seen its value increase by more than 800,000%\u2026 According to Whale Alert, a service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions, the wallet was activated on September 23, 2021, and transferred its entire balance to different addresses.\n\nWho owns this wallet and why did they decide to move their bitcoins after so long? This is a question that many in the crypto community are asking, but there is no definitive answer. Some speculate that it could be a whale, an individual or a group with a large stash of bitcoins, who is planning to sell or trade their coins. Others suggest that it could be someone who forgot or lost their password and finally managed to recover it. And some even wonder if it could be Satoshi Nakamoto himself, returning to claim his fortune.\n\nIt is not possible to link the wallet to an identity or a location, due to the anonymous and decentralized nature of bitcoin. However, it is possible to track the movements of the coins through the public blockchain ledger, which records every transaction that ever happened on the network. If the owner of the wallet decides to cash out their bitcoins on an exchange or a platform that requires identification, they might reveal themselves. But until then, they remain a mystery.\n\nThis is not the first time that a dormant wallet containing huge sums of bitcoins has been activated without explanation. In November 2020, a mystery person moved more than $1 billion worth of bitcoins from the fourth largest wallet in the world. The wallet had been inactive since 2015 and contained 69,369 BTC. In January 2021, another wallet that had been dormant since June 2010 woke up and transferred 50 BTC to another address. The wallet was believed to be one of the earliest ones created by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThere are dozens of other wallets that have been inactive for at least nine years and contain thousands of bitcoins each. Some of them might belong to people who died, lost their passwords, or simply forgot about their coins. Some of them might belong to early adopters who are waiting for the right moment to sell or use their bitcoins. And some of them might belong to unknown entities who have their own reasons for keeping their coins dormant.\n\nThe activation of these wallets can have an impact on the bitcoin market, as they introduce new supply and demand dynamics. If the owners decide to sell their bitcoins, they might cause a price drop and volatility in the short term. If they decide to hold or use their bitcoins, they might increase the demand and scarcity of the cryptocurrency. Alternatively, they could use their funds to support some crypto-related project or cause, or simply hold on to them for longer.\n\nThe activation of this dormant wallet is a reminder of the history and mystery of Bitcoin, a decentralized and pseudonymous currency that has grown from a niche experiment to a global phenomenon. It also shows that there are still many hidden treasures in the crypto space, waiting to be discovered or claimed by their rightful owners.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin price has been a topic of great interest and speculation in the financial world, with investors eagerly watching its price movements for potential opportunities. Recently, an interesting development has caught the attention of both seasoned traders and crypto enthusiasts alike.\n\nAccording to Mikybull Crypto, there is a long-term chart feature that, if it continues to hold, could potentially lead to a significant upside for Bitcoin (BTC). In his latest analysis, the popular trader highlighted encouraging signs on the BTC/USD weekly chart, suggesting the possibility of a remarkable 60% surge in value. This potential surge would catapult bitcoin price to an impressive point of approximately $40,000.\n\nThe question on everyone\u2019s mind is: Will Bitcoin indeed experience this substantial upside, and what factors might contribute to such a surge?\n\nLong-Term Chart Signals Potential Upside For Bitcoin Price\n\nWith Bitcoin still confined within a narrow trading range it entered nearly three months ago, traders and investors find themselves in a quandary when it comes to predicting short-term price targets. The day-to-day performance of the cryptocurrency has failed to establish a clear trend, leaving $30,000 as a formidable resistance level hanging overhead.\n\nNonetheless, renowned trader Mikybull Crypto remains optimistic, as he identifies an intriguing price action on the higher time frames that could signal a significant move in the near future. According to his analysis, the weekly chart reveals the completion and subsequent retesting of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern for BTC/USD.\n\n#Bitcoin is flashing a text book inverse head and shoulders on the weekly TF.

This significant price level has become a popular target for many traders and investors, as it symbolizes a potential breakthrough for the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nAdding to the discourse, renowned trader and analyst Credible Crypto recently made a prediction suggesting that Bitcoin may enter a sideways phase, ranging between $20,000 and $40,000, for approximately 12 months following the upcoming halving event in April 2024.\n\nExpectations: \u201cThe Bitcoin halving is in April 2024.
