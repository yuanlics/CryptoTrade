        "content": "Visa is Bringing Bitcoin Pollution Everywhere You Want to Be\n\nVisa is just about everywhere with its credit and debit card offerings accepted by millions of merchants around the globe and used by millions of people to make their daily purchases. Now, the world\u2019s largest payment processor is also exploring new ways for customers and businesses to use Bitcoin.\n\nVisa is just about everywhere with its credit and debit card offerings accepted by millions of merchants around the globe and used by millions of people to make their daily purchases. Now, the world\u2019s largest payment processor is also exploring new ways for customers and businesses to use Bitcoin. This support for Bitcoin contradicts the company\u2019s stated commitments to sustainability and reducing climate warming emissions because Bitcoin is an electricity hog, often powered by dirty energy. Bitcoin operations could become even worse due to adoption driven by Visa\u2019s new services.\n\nWhile Visa has extensive expertise on cryptocurrencies, the company is not putting those resources to work on cleaning up Bitcoin\u2019s pollution and climate impacts despite making strong corporate climate action pledges.\n\nHelping Grow Bitcoin\u2019s Pollution\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is primarily a speculative investment in which people bet on whether its price goes up or down. With support from Visa and other large financial services companies, that could change. Visa is making it easier for people to buy, trade, and spend bitcoin which is vital for the cryptocurrencies growth and its actual use for transactions. Visa is collaborating with crypto exchanges to let people buy their morning cup of coffee or weekly groceries using bitcoin. For example, people in the U.S. who store bitcoin in a Coinbase wallet can spend it at any merchant in Visa\u2019s vast network thanks to a card issued in partnership with Coinbase.\n\nMore widespread use and greater demand means a higher bitcoin price, which has historically contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s enormous energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. [1] Here\u2019s why: when the price of bitcoin is high, there is incentive for \u201cminers\u201d to employ more computing power and electricity in the digital guessing game to win new bitcoin and fees.\n\nMuch of Bitcoin\u2019s electricity use is generated by fossil fuels: 62% globally according to estimates from Cambridge University researchers. And dirty coal is the largest single source.\n\nBitcoin miners using more energy also puts more demand on often-strained electrical grids and uses energy that could be directed towards other socially necessary uses including the rapid expansion of electrification that is needed to address the climate crisis.\n\nPutting Dirty Bitcoin in Your Wallet\n\nVisa is one of several large financial services companies leading the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nVisa has multiple crypto-linked credit and debit cards that enable customers to spend and earn rewards in bitcoin. One such card is offered in partnership with Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States. The Coinbase card automatically converts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to US Dollars at point of sale with any retailer in Visa\u2019s network. Customers can also earn reward points in bitcoin. Visa also partnered with Crypto.com, another large crypto exchange company, to support a prepaid card that customers can load with bitcoin. This joins other bitcoin rewards debit cards like the one offered by Fold in collaboration with Visa which has reportedly rewarded over $30 million in bitcoin since launching in 2020.\n\nConcerningly, Visa is also expanding its crypto offerings around the world despite mounting evidence of Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact. The company recently launched a debit card in collaboration with EU crypto exchange Lama that allows customers to spend their bitcoin. Visa created a long-term strategic partnership with Wirex, a crypto platform and exchange company, to expand in the United Kingdom and Asia-Pacific by offering crypto debit and prepaid cards.\n\nPartnerships with crypto companies and products that enable using bitcoin have created a growing business for Visa. In the first quarter of 2022, Visa reported that customers made $2.5 billion worth of purchases on their Visa crypto cards. The company said its network of crypto wallet partners grew from 54 to 65 by early 2022, including Coinbase, Circle, and BlockFi, and that almost 100 million merchants now accept crypto, including bitcoin, on the Visa network. In February 2023, Visa leaders denied a Reuters report claiming the company was pausing new crypto partnerships and services, and reaffirmed that the company was still moving forward into the crypto sector.\n\nVisa also helps other companies adopt cryptocurrencies. And because Bitcoin has the largest market cap of any cryptocurrency, this certainly includes Bitcoin. Visa\u2019s Digital Currency Innovation Hub assists clients in understanding cryptocurrencies and creating new business opportunities and products. Visa\u2019s crypto consulting and advisory services help clients, like financial institutions and retailers, navigate the complex and changing cryptocurrency landscape. The hub also publishes public educational materials on crypto and blockchain technologies.\n\nBitcoin Reveals Visa\u2019s Climate Hypocrisy\n\nVisa has committed to reaching net zero by 2040, in line with the goals set by the Paris Climate Agreement. To accomplish this, Visa has set science based emissions reductions targets to meet a 1.5 C pathway that many see as necessary for avoiding the worst of the climate catastrophe. Visa also says the company embeds sustainability into its partnerships and initiatives, principles the company does not appear to be applying in its Bitcoin-related partnerships. Visa also offers products to increase public awareness of climate change, such as a CO2 calculator for customers to track emissions from their purchases. Yet, Visa has not done anything to account for emissions from bitcoin transactions even though researchers find that bitcoin transactions have a much larger carbon footprint than transactions using US Dollars and other traditional government-issued currencies.\n\nVisa needs to work on cleaning up Bitcoin or stop growing its Bitcoin-related services. Publicly acknowledging Bitcoin\u2019s climate problems is the first step. This is an opportunity for Visa to lead the financial services sector on climate change, sustainability, and technological innovation. We need companies like Visa to send a powerful message to Bitcoin adopters that the technology needs to innovate to align with climate goals.\n\nCryptocurrencies can operate using cleaner technologies, and with the support and creativity of companies like Visa, we can future-proof Bitcoin against a warming world.\n\nNotes"

        "content": "Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.\n\nT he origins of covid-19 remain unknown. Most scientists think it jumped from wild animals to humans at a meat market in Wuhan. But it is also possible it escaped from a virology research lab in the same city.\n\nNow a similar argument has broken out around bitcoin, the first and most used cryptocurrency. Bitcoin\u2019s accepted origin is that it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous coder, who published a paper describing it in 2008 before later vanishing from sight.\n\nBut a theory circulating online holds that bitcoin was dreamed up by the National Security Agency ( NSA ), an American spy agency that also does cutting-edge cryptography research. \u201cI think it was a shuttered internal R & D project which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release,\u201d tweeted Nic Carter, a prominent bitcoin fan. Mr Carter and his fellow travellers think they have a smoking gun: a paper written in 1996 by NSA employees entitled \u201cHow to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash\u201d. And the paper cites work by a researcher named \u201cTatsuaki Okamoto\u201d.\n\nBut the paper is more smoke than gun. It is merely a survey of cryptographic ideas that might be used in digital cash. Unlike bitcoin, whose big innovation was its decentralised design, the schemes in the paper rely on an overseeing authority. It discusses the risks that electronic cash would pose to taxation and law enforcement. \u201cThus the idea that the NSA would develop a decentralised, trustless cryptocurrency as a \u2018monetary bioweapon\u2019 that would impair their own government\u2019s functions\u201d is implausible,\u201d writes David Rosenthal, a cryptocurrency sceptic, on his blog.\n\nJust another conspiracy theory, then? Almost certainly. But something similar has happened before. In 1997 it emerged that Clifford Cocks, a mathematician at GCHQ , Britain\u2019s NSA equivalent, had secretly invented a vital cryptographic technology that underlies both bitcoin and the internet in general, several years before the trio of American researchers who had been given credit.\n\nA better parallel between bitcoin and covid-19 may be that, like the virus, the cryptocurrency has proved hard to kill off. Despite a big crash last year, a bitcoin is still worth around $27,500. \u25a0"

        "content": "A new study conducted by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has shed light on the true extent of Bitcoin's impact on cross-border payments, revealing that its significance may be even greater than previously believed.\n\nAccording to a report by Reuters, the findings challenge conventional assumptions and underscore the growing relevance of Bitcoin in the global financial landscape.\n\nConducted by the organization's test lab, the study sought to comprehensively examine Bitcoin's role in cross-border transactions. While public data often provides a partial view of cryptocurrency activities, this study utilized a novel approach, including the development of a new \"global Bitcoin mapping system\" that also reportedly incorporates non-public data from private companies.\n\nDetails about the proprietary system were not provided by the report. Notably, however, it did acknowledge that its data is likely imperfect given it remains possible to use Bitcoin anonymously and without identification.\n\nThe system tracked transactions, addresses, and wallet movements to paint a more complete picture of Bitcoin's cross-border payment activities, the report said.\n\nMoreover, the study revealed that Bitcoin was increasingly being used for remittances, providing a lifeline for individuals in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. Its borderless nature and ease of use made it an attractive option for sending funds across international boundaries.\n\nThe findings of this study are expected to stimulate further discussions among regulators, financial institutions, and policymakers regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions.\n\nFounded in the 1930s, the BIS is owned by member central banks, and its primary goal is to \"foster international monetary and financial cooperation.\"\n\nAs such, the report demonstrates a continued interest in Bitcoin among global central banks, some who want a stronger regulatory approach to the technology.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH): What is it and How it Works - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has emerged as a key rival in the ever-changing cryptocurrency scene. However, what exactly is Bitcoin Cash, and how does it work? This article will cast light on the essential characteristics of BCH, assisting you in understanding its importance in the world of digital currencies.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash, often known as BCH, is a cryptocurrency that arose from a heated argument among the Bitcoin community in 2017. BCH is fundamentally similar to its predecessor, Bitcoin (BTC), in that it uses blockchain technology for safe and decentralized transactions. However, there are significant features that distinguish BCH.\n\nBitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin\n\nOne of the key differences between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin is how they handle scalability. The purpose of Bitcoin Cash was to alleviate Bitcoin's scalability difficulties by increasing the block size limit. This allows BCH to process more transactions each block while maintaining lower rates, making it more suitable for daily transactions.\n\nBitcoin Cash transfers are generally faster and less expensive than Bitcoin transactions. As a result, in the Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash battle, BCH comes out as an appealing option for people and organizations looking for effective digital payment solutions. While Bitcoin is frequently referred to as \"digital gold,\" Bitcoin Cash aspires to be \"digital cash\" - a medium of exchange for ordinary transactions.\n\nWhat Affects Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nBitcoin Cash, like all cryptocurrencies, is vulnerable to a variety of factors that influence its price and adoption. Understanding these aspects is critical for anyone thinking about investing in BCH or using it in transactions.\n\nMarket Demand: Bitcoin Cash's price is heavily influenced by market demand. As more people and organizations understand BCH's utility as a digital currency, demand for it may rise, increasing its value.\n\nBCH is influenced by market mood, news, and public perception, just like other cryptocurrencies. Positive news and widespread adoption can increase sentiment, whilst bad news might cause market volatility.\n\nGovernment Regulations and Legal Developments: Government regulations and legal developments can have a big impact on the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin Cash. Regulatory clarity and acceptability can promote trust and stability, whereas strict regulations might stifle growth.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Upgrades to Bitcoin Cash's underlying technology, such as its blockchain, might improve its functionality and security, thereby attracting additional users and investors.\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash has a number of characteristics that make it an intriguing cryptocurrency option:\n\nFast Transactions: BCH transactions are well-known for their quickness. Because of the large block size, more transactions may be processed rapidly, making it appropriate for everyday use.\n\nLow Transaction Fees: When compared to Bitcoin, BCH has lower transaction fees, making it a more cost-effective option for moving value.\n\nDecentralization: Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash functions on a decentralized network, which reduces the danger of censorship or control by a single person or government.\n\nScalability: BCH's scalability features allow it can handle more transactions per second, assuring seamless operation during peak demand periods.\n\nRisk of Bitcoin Cash\n\nWhile Bitcoin Cash has numerous benefits, it is not without risks and challenges:\n\nFluctuation: BCH, like most cryptocurrencies, experiences price fluctuation. Its value can change dramatically over short time periods, affecting its effectiveness as a store of money.\n\nUncertainty in Regulatory Framework: Cryptocurrency regulations varies by country, and changes in legislation may affect the legality and use of BCH in different places.\n\nCompetition: Other cryptocurrencies and digital payment systems compete with BCH. Its capacity to sustain its market position is dependent on its acceptance and utility.\n\nConcerns about security: While BCH is built on blockchain technology, it is not immune to security concerns such as hacking and fraud. Users must take care to safeguard their BCH investments.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Cash has emerged as a viable alternative to Bitcoin in the constantly expanding cryptocurrency ecosystem, delivering speedier transactions and reduced costs. It distinguishes itself by emphasizing scalability and usability for everyday transactions. However, investors and users should be aware of the inherent risks and challenges of BCH, including as price volatility and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhere can you use Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBecause of Bitcoin Cash's expanding acceptance, it has been integrated into a variety of sectors, making it more adaptable in its applications. Here are some examples of popular BCH applications:\n\nOnline Retail: Bitcoin Cash is currently accepted as payment by many online retailers and e-commerce platforms. This enables customers to utilize BCH to make purchases, broadening its application beyond traditional fiat currencies.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Transactions: Due to its low transaction fees and quick confirmation times, Bitcoin Cash is an excellent alternative to peer-to-peer electronic cash transactions. BCH is a great choice for sending money to a friend or paying for services.\n\nGaming and entertainment have embraced Bitcoin Cash, allowing users to use BCH to purchase in-game products, access content, and participate in online gaming communities.\n\nRemittances: Because of its worldwide reach and minimal fees, Bitcoin Cash is a feasible option for international remittances. Users can transmit money quickly and cheaply across boundaries.\n\nCharitable Donations: Many charitable organizations and non-profits now accept Bitcoin Cash donations, allowing supporters to use cryptocurrencies to contribute to causes they care about.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin Cash?\n\nIf you want to buy Bitcoin Cash, there are numerous steps you may take to get started:\n\nChoose a trustworthy Cryptocurrency Exchange: Choose a trustworthy cryptocurrency exchange that allows you to trade Bitcoin Cash. BCH trading is available on popular exchanges including as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Bitstamp.\n\nMake an Account: Create an account on the chosen exchange. As part of the registration process, you may be required to give personal information and complete identification verification.\n\nDeposit funds into your exchange account using your preferred payment method, such as bank transfer, credit card, or another cryptocurrency.\n\nMake an Order: Once your account has been financed, go to the exchange's trading section and make an order to acquire Bitcoin Cash. You can indicate the amount you want to buy as well as the price you're willing to pay.\n\nSafe a Wallet: While you can keep your BCH on the exchange, it is best to move your funds to a safe cryptocurrency wallet for increased security. There are hardware wallets, software wallets, and mobile wallets to consider.\n\nSafe a Wallet: While you can keep your BCH on the exchange, it is best to move your funds to a safe cryptocurrency wallet for increased security. There are hardware wallets, software wallets, and mobile wallets to consider. Monitor and manage your BCH holdings by keeping an eye on the bitcoin market. Depending on your investing objectives and market conditions, you can purchase, sell, or keep BCH.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin Cash so cheap?\n\nSeveral factors contribute to Bitcoin Cash's perceived affordability when compared to Bitcoin:"

        "title": "Thinking About Getting a Loan With Your Bitcoin? You'll Want to Read This First - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Investors are discovering new ways to put their Bitcoin (BTC -2.59%) holdings to use as the cryptocurrency becomes more widely accepted in the financial world. One such option is to use Bitcoin as collateral to secure a loan.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to move forward, there is a growing desire among holders to access the asset's liquidity without having to sell it. However, investors interested in obtaining a Bitcoin-backed loan will quickly realize that there are significant differences compared to traditional loans.\n\nHere's a detailed overview of what these loans entail to help investors make more informed decisions about Bitcoin-backed loans and the various options available.\n\nGeneral differences\n\nLike any other loan, the total value of the loan holders can obtain depends on the amount of collateral they can offer. Loans on some other assets, like some mortgage products with real estate as collateral, offer up to 97% loan-to-value (LTV), meaning they only need to offer up to 3% of the total loan as collateral. However, Bitcoin's extreme price volatility means that those seeking to leverage their holdings will face more stringent borrowing terms.\n\nActual conditions vary between lenders and depend on market conditions, but it isn't uncommon for Bitcoin loans to require LTV ratios as high as 50%. Under these circumstances, a potential borrower with $500,000 in Bitcoin could only borrow up to $250,000. Compare this to a prospective home buyer looking for a mortgage, where one might be able to borrow $485,000 toward a $500,000 home, assuming they meet specific criteria.\n\nNot only do Bitcoin loan borrowers have to pledge more collateral, but the interest rates tied to these loans are generally much higher. While the average mortgage interest rate hovers around 8% today, Bitcoin borrowers should generally expect rates to be even higher than this, at times up to 15%.\n\nAvailable options\n\nClearly, there are distinct differences to consider when looking to obtain Bitcoin-collateralized loans. But sometimes, personal conditions or financial goals warrant exploring Bitcoin loans. For those interested, there are two main routes to obtain Bitcoin loans: Centralized and decentralized lenders.\n\nCentralized lending platforms provide a more traditional approach to obtaining loans using Bitcoin as collateral. These platforms, operated by a centralized authority such as a company or bank, are usually more straightforward and accessible. Typically, users can choose to receive loans in fiat currency or in stablecoins. The advantages of centralized lenders include a less complicated process, higher loan amounts compared to decentralized platforms, and potential access to a broader range of assets for borrowing. Popular centralized options include Unchained Capital, Binance, and Bitfinex.\n\nHowever, the centralized platforms aren't without their risks. During the recent crypto winter and market volatility hit, multiple crypto lenders became insolvent, ultimately putting borrowers' assets at risk.\n\nDecentralized Bitcoin loans, facilitated through decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchains like Stacks or Wrapped Bitcoin, offer an alternative to collateralize Bitcoin without having to trust or rely on a centralized intermediary. By locking up Bitcoin, users can generate a loan in stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. This method substantially reduces counterparty risk, as the process is managed by smart contracts, providing transparency and security.\n\nLike the centralized platforms, there are some drawbacks with DeFi lenders. The interest rates on DeFi loans are often not fixed and can be highly volatile. Additionally, the DeFi space can be complex, potentially posing challenges for less experienced users.\n\nFinal considerations\n\nFor investors seeking swift access to liquidity without triggering taxable events, Bitcoin loans can present a valuable financial opportunity. However, as with any financial decision, careful consideration of individual circumstances and alignment with personal goals is crucial.\n\nWhether people are opting for centralized lenders with their established systems or decentralized platforms offering alternatives, understanding the collateralization process, loan terms, and associated risks like interest rates and potential smart contract vulnerabilities is paramount. Ultimately, the decision to leverage Bitcoin as collateral for loans demands a balance between financial objectives and risk tolerance."

Zimbabwe, Venezuela and Lebanon often compete for media coverage about runaway inflation levels, but the Cuban peso is not far behind.\n\n\n\nThe Cuban peso has devalued so much over the last few years that carrying bags of cash is increasingly common among the rich and the poor.\n\nIn practice, even if someone bought Bitcoin at the top of the 2021 bull run at $69,000, their money is worth much less in Cuban pesos. Whereas Bitcoin dropped 80% to its bear market low, it has since recovered 100%, and the peso has devalued by 90%.\n\nThe realization that someone should swap local currency for the Bitcoin top, knowing that it will crash and they\u2019ll still retain more purchasing power, is one of the many financial wake-up calls received while working on Cointelegraph\u2019s new documentary, The Truth Behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution.\n\nIn 2021, I came across the article \u201cInside Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution\u201d by Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein, in which he explains how and why Cubans were utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s stateless and low-fee properties to save money and escape financial oppression.\n\nIn line with the Bitcoin mantra of Don\u2019t trust, Verify, I went to see with my own eyes what Gladstein described.\n\nCamera in hand with my trusty travel partner Paco de la India by my side, I network my way into the Cuba Bitcoin community, which now counts thousands of enthusiasts and advocates.\n\nLa Cultura Cubana\n\nFollowing one of the largest financial conferences in the world, Bitcoin Miami, in arguably the world\u2019s most capitalist arena, the United States of America, I hop across the Caribbean to Cuba, one of the few extant socialist states. The contrast hits me harder than the Cuban tropical heat.\n\n\n\nFrom the moment I landed at Havana Jose Marti International Airport, I noticed some funny quirks: doors open manually (forget automatic sensors), check-in and immigration are done on pen and paper, and the taxis are 1950s Chevrolets.\n\nA retro car in Havana\u2019s city center. (Cointelegraph)\n\nIt\u2019s common to describe visiting Cuba as a time warp. It\u2019s not hyperbole; Cuba cannot access world markets, financial institutions or trade. The United States has subjected Cuba to a trade embargo \u2014 the longest in modern history \u2014 since the island nation nationalized U.S. oil refineries in 1960.\n\n\n\nAs a result, Cuban industry, economic output and commerce lag far behind the modern world.\n\nThe embargo, coupled with more than half a century of communism, has resulted in a highly educated, extraordinarily literate but desperately poor and hungry population, many of whom possess a heartbreaking desire to leave the island, or in Spanish, to find a \u201csalida\u201d \u2014 an exit.\n\n\n\nWhy stay in a country where a taxi driver earns more than an atomic engineer \u2014 and the emaciated engineer struggles to feed their family?\n\nAdopting Bitcoin\n\nIn such an environment, it\u2019s a wonder why Cubas don\u2019t flock to Bitcoin as money that exists outside of state control. However, many Cubans are learning about and slowly turning to Bitcoin.\n\nCatrya, one of the main characters in Cointelegraph\u2019s new documentary and one of the founders of Cuba Bitcoin, explains that there could be around 5,000 Bitcoiners in Cuba, and if you include crypto enthusiasts generally, the number is higher still.\n\nCubans do not have easy on-ramps into crypto. Firstly, those with internet connections cannot sign up for Binance, Coinbase or Gemini due to their nationality. For Cuban Americans on the island, Cuba\u2019s government restricts access to American websites. Cubans buy Bitcoin peer-to-peer through Telegram or WhatsApp groups and at in-person meetups.\n\nWhat amazes me is the tiny amounts of money Cubans put aside to save money or \u201cstack sats.\u201d Saving 1,000 satoshis (less than $1 a week) is meaningful to a Cuban on $40 monthly. The Cuban peso may not be here in 10 years, but Bitcoin certainly will be.\n\nThe peer-to-peer process is straightforward, but it\u2019s not beginner-friendly, and these hurdles can hamper adoption \u2014 although they do have a silver lining, as Catrya explains:\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019re denied [access to exchanges] by default for being Cuban, we can never do KYC [Know Your Customer], so that\u2019s a good thing for us, at least in terms of privacy.\u201d\n\nBuying Bitcoin peer-to-peer and storing Bitcoin by taking ownership of the private keys is safer. Customers who trusted custodians such as FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and Vauld with their crypto were wiped out. Cubans don\u2019t have that option, and while it takes longer, it\u2019s more secure.\n\nErich Garcia Cruz, the founder of QvaPay and BitRemesas \u2014 a currency remitter using Bitcoin that boasts tens of thousands of Cuban users \u2014 says that the small but growing number of Bitcoin customers somewhat represents Cuba\u2019s fledgling internet culture.\n\nConnectivity and freedom of information\n\nCubans could get online in earnest from 2013. So, while the rest of the world was enjoying the iPhone 5C and 4G, a few lucky Cubans fortunate to access a computer could get online that year, albeit with an awful internet connection.\n\nNow, Cubans can access 3G and sometimes 4G connectivity on their phones. The tech-savvy and younger Cubans use VPNs to circumnavigate online restrictions.\n\nGenerally, the lag in internet infrastructure combined with the cost and difficulty of buying a smartphone on a frighteningly low salary means Cuba is way behind in IT.\n\nIn 2021, the World Bank reported that three-quarters of Cuba has access to the internet. But while the issue is improving, internet censorship is rife, and Cubans are repeatedly told to trust the government through state-sponsored TV, newspapers and media.\n\n\n\nIndependent media publications are classified as \u201cenemy propaganda,\u201d which is something I was made aware of a few times during my investigation. I won\u2019t share those stories here, but it\u2019s safe to say reciting such stories would\u2019ve landed me in trouble had I stayed in Cuba.\n\nTwo exiled Cuban journalists have since advised me to avoid returning to the island for some time, especially if the Cointelegraph documentary gets a lot of attention.\n\nA funny caveat to the state-run media is that some Cubans were orange-pilled by Bitcoin proponent Max Keiser. His appearances on the Russia Today news channel were approved for broadcast in Cuba. Some of Catrya\u2019s peers watched the show where Keiser bashes fiat currencies and promotes Bitcoin.\n\nAnd yet, Bitcoin is magic internet money; it lives on the web. If Cubans aren\u2019t online \u2014 or watching Russia Today \u2014 how can they know about it?\n\nOrange pill Cuba\n\nBitalion, one of the Cuba Bitcoin founders, works in telecommunications for the government. He explains that as a privileged public sector worker, he benefits from better internet connection speeds and lower online censorship levels.\n\nBitalion speaks to Paco before dinner\n\nBitalion stumbled across the Bitcoin white paper in 2014 and became infatuated with the idea of an independent, borderless currency. He rhetorically poses the question: For those fortunate Cubans who are able to travel abroad, what can they bring to the new country? The peso in their pocket, or Bitcoin in a mobile wallet?\n\nAs with the other Bitcoin advocates on the island, Bitalion volunteers his time to educate people and support Bitcoin adoption. He\u2019s also one of the handful of Cubans running a Bitcoin node. At Cuba\u2019s first-ever Bitcoin-only meetup, he demonstrates to dozens of Cubans how to pay for goods and services directly to his Lightning Network node.\n\n\n\nCruz, Forte and countless business owners explain that Bitcoin is an easy \u201corange pill\u201d to swallow, particularly for the digitally capable Cubans. You merely explain to them that nobody controls it; it\u2019s stateless money.\n\nInterviewing Forte\n\nAt face value, Bitcoin is a useful tool for a country that has been financially and economically handicapped for generations. But for Forte, Catrya and Bitalion, the ideology of Bitcoin resonates strongly.\n\nForte jokes, \u201cSatoshi didn\u2019t create Bitcoin for Cubans, but it really comes in handy for us.\u201d\n\nIn the hope of encouraging more Cubans to explore Bitcoin, the trio and the Cuba Bitcoin community host monthly educational meetups in which they explain the principles of Bitcoin and delve into its philosophy.\n\n\n\nThey recently introduced the popular Mi Primer Bitcoin (My First Bitcoin) program in the country, which is already picking up speed in El Salvador and will soon be instructed in schools nationwide.\n\nPor qu\u00e9 aceptas Bitcoin? Why do you accept Bitcoin?\n\nQvaPay\u2019s Cruz explains that Bitcoin is the financial tool that allows the small but growing number of Cuban business owners to access foreign products.\n\n\n\nRecent U.S. presidential administrations had fluctuating policies on the Cuban embargo, relaxing and tightening different aspects based on political expediency.\n\nCruz orange-pills suppliers in an attempt to open up the Cuban economy to international markets where possible:\n\n\u201cYou are accepting Bitcoin because you\u2019re dealing with a private [independent] coin. The government doesn\u2019t have access to the transactions you and you have the freedom to do whatever you want.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cfreedom,\u201d or \u201clibertad,\u201d popped up frequently as I mingled and met with Cuban Bitcoiners, crypto enthusiasts and entrepreneurs. The fact that citizens can hold money in a wallet, outside of government overreach, appealed to many Cubans whom the government has consistently let down.\n\nThe ability to store wealth on a mobile phone in a Bitcoin Lightning wallet instead of in pesos at a bank is also an efficiency gain. It means no more queues at banks to cash in money that could devalue by a few pesos over a bank holiday weekend.\n\nSpeaking with Erich Garcia Cruz. Yes, the V from Vendetta poster was intentional.\n\nCruz and three other business owners also share that accepting Bitcoin benefits holidaymakers. Adan, a nightclub, bar and restaurant owner, explains that tourists bring a lot of cash to Cuba for vacation \u2014 and that\u2019s risky.\n\nHaving Bitcoin on a mobile phone in a wallet is a safer way to travel than flashing wads of dollar bills that end up on the black market in Cuba, inadvertently supporting the illicit and sometimes dangerous black market activity of exchanging notes in public.\n\nAdan accepts Bitcoin because of the international branding the Bitcoin logo brings. It opens up his bars\u2019 doors to another potential market. Similar to El Salvador, where Bitcoin tourism has become a trend, bars and restaurants in Cuba could also attract holidaymakers to spend satoshis instead of pesos at the till.\n\nFinally, there are myriad ways in which adopting Bitcoin can lead to positive and unexpected outcomes. Mister Navi\u2019s bar and restaurant, run by Mr. Navi and his son Julian, recently began accepting Bitcoin. Following a conversation with Forte, Catrya and Bitalion, the Cuba Bitcoin group now hosts educational Bitcoin meetups at the venue.\n\nFrom right: Mr. Navi, Julian, Paco and me at Mr. Navi\u2019s\n\nI tipped one of the service staff in Bitcoin at Mr. Navi\u2019s the first day we visited. Five days later, I saw her again when we went out for dinner with Mr. Navi and Julian. She seems different \u2014 I ask her if she is OK. She confesses that she was mugged a few days ago, and the attacker stole her purse, cash and phone.\n\nTo her surprise, when she downloaded the Bitcoin Lightning app where I\u2019d tipped her, the funds magically reappeared on her new phone. On seeing her wide-eyed reaction, I tipped her again.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear that, for Cubans, Bitcoin could represent a critical instrument for securing their financial future in the face of runaway inflation and government interference, or as a way of opening up to embargoed markets and the international financial world.\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions and perspectives expressed in this article are those of the author and are not necessarily those of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "3 reasons why Bitcoin is struggling to rally above $28.5K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On Oct. 2, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) saw a 5.5% intraday increase to $28,600, but the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lost momentum as the highly anticipated launch of Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to generate significant trading volumes.\n\nWhile the recent rally into the upper end of the current price range was likely encouraging to investors, recent comments from United States Federal Reserve representatives reiterated concerns about an impending economic downturn.\n\nBitcoin demonstrated short-term strength by maintaining support at $27,200 on Oct. 3 and subsequently surged above $27,500 on Oct. 5. Nevertheless, three key trading metrics indicate a lackluster level of support. These metrics encompass spot market volumes, derivatives and confidence in the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMacroeconomic forces exert downward pressure on Bitcoin price\n\nOn Oct. 2, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr stated in New York that he anticipates a slowdown in economic growth \u201cbelow its potential\u201d due to higher interest rates constraining economic activity. He also noted that the full impact of the current monetary policy has yet to be realized. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the market is currently evenly divided on the possibility of another interest rate hike by the Fed in 2023.\n\nOn Oct. 3, the real yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys, a measure that adjusts for inflation, reached 2.47% \u2014 its highest level in nearly 15 years \u2014 according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department. This development partly explains the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) reaching its highest point in 10 months.\n\nAdditionally, Reuters reported that the U.S. has become a relatively more appealing investment destination due to its \u201cresilient economy,\u201d boasting stronger growth prospects when compared with Europe and China.\n\nBitcoin trading metrics show diminished activity for leverage longs\n\nBitcoin monthly futures typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, BTC futures contracts should typically trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe BTC futures premium continues to trade below the 5% neutral threshold, remaining in the neutral-to-bearish range. This indicates a lack of demand for leveraged long positions.\n\nAdditionally, spot trading activity on traditional exchanges has declined to levels not seen since late 2020, signifying reduced participation by institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin daily spot trading volume, USD. Source: Messari and Kaiko\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the decrease in trading volumes may be attributed to major U.S.-based trading firms, such as Jane Street Group and Jump Trading, distancing themselves from the cryptocurrency markets ahead of May 2023. Bloomberg reported that the primary reason for this shift was \u201cheightened regulatory scrutiny,\u201d which rendered the market less appealing to institutional investors.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price drops its early week gains \u2014 Here is why\n\nInvestors\u2019 expectation for a spot BTC ETF drops\n\nOne of the factors supporting Bitcoin\u2019s 68% gains in 2023 is the anticipation of approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, despite the regulator\u2019s multiple postponements, the recent launch of Ether futures-based ETFs on Oct. 2 saw lackluster demand.\n\nFurthermore, despite a favorable court ruling for the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, it continues to trade at a 19% discount compared with its Bitcoin holdings. This data indicates a lack of confidence in the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, as investors would have the option to redeem their shares at par value following the conversion.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin was unable to surpass the $28,500 resistance level, and Federal Reserve representatives warned of impending economic pressures. Consequently, the prospects of breaking above this resistance in the short term appear less than favorable.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "After sending out indications about Web5 and BitKey in June 2022, Block (NYSE: SQ) is officially launching its self-custody hardware wallet, BitKey.\n\nBenzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference, scheduled for Nov. 14, is poised to be a pivotal gathering for the digital assets community. The event will spotlight the latest trends, innovations, and challenges in the digital asset realm.\n\nWhat Happened: Global tech company Block will soon release its inaugural Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) hardware wallet, BitKey, publicly.\n\nThe goal is to provide additional layers of security and eliminating intermediary roles are the highlights of the product.\n\nThe news was announced via X. Many beta users highlighted the image of the wallet, which is like a compact hexagon. The device with a stone-like exterior also adds a fingerprint sensor increasing the layers of bitcoin security to the device. The launch comes amid the overall crypto industry facing security and governance issues.\n\nRead Now: Top Of The Crypto Pack - MetaMask Leads Crypto Wallets In Monthly Visits, Named One Of Year's Best\n\nBitKey, a multi-signature self-custody Bitcoin wallet, will feature a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools. Add, send, receive and transfer are the facilities available by BitKey. The transfer of Bitcoin to BitKey is facilitated from exchange partners \u2014 Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Cash App \u2014 safely without the conflict of standard copy and paste. Users can also buy Bitcoin through third-party partners who provide this service integrated into the BitKey app.\n\nWhy It Matters: Co-founder Jack Dorsey has emphasized the need for user autonomy over the user\u2019s Bitcoin assets. BitKey will let users securely manage their Bitcoin holdings without the interference of an intermediary.\n\nThe hardware wallet is expected to allow users to control their private keys thereby avoiding the risk of losses in customer assets.\n\nDorsey had expressed last year the idea of BitKey along with his Web5 idea, a new decentralized Web, centered on Bitcoin. Web5 will be the combination of Web3 and Web2. Unlike Web3, which relies on blockchain and tokenization technology to decentralize the network, Web5\u2019s entire dependence will be on a single network, Bitcoin, and without any intermediary who can control user data. BitKey could be the key to this new web.\n\nFind out more on Web3, Web2, and other blockchain platforms. Meet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets. Tickets are flying: Get yours!\n\nThe product disclosure comes on the heels of Jack Dorsey recently posing tech giant, Apple a question on platform X (earlier Twitter) as to why it does not support Bitcoin. Apple did not respond to the same. However, discussions on the web spread that if Apple adopts Bitcoin, it would be regarded as the queen of crypto.\n\nMajor players in the industry are also looking to onboard Bitcoin in the major financial stream.

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin has been on the rise again this week. Illustration: Rafael Henrique/SOPA/LightRocket/Getty (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin's price has seen a notable increase in the past week. The rise has been driven in some part by a dynamic between short and long-term bitcoin holders, according to an analyst.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has risen by 4.5% in the past week, now changing hands at $27,602, (\u00a322,771) according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThis is a retrace from a height of $28,500, that was reached on Monday. The early October high marked a significant price point that has not been reached since August 17, 2023.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\n\"Bitcoin now finds itself in a technical range, confined between the resistance level of $28,500 and the support level of $27,100,\" CryptoQuant analyst Adam Mourad told Yahoo Finance UK.\n\nUnderlying market dynamics driving the bitcoin price\n\nThe analyst explained the underlying factors that could be at play. Mourad described a market dynamic that has developed between short and long-term bitcoin holders. He referred to on-chain metrics that demonstrated long-term holders acquiring the digital assets that are being sold by short-term holders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The supply held by short-term holders has dipped to its lowest point in nearly eight years, a level not seen since November 2015, with a value of 3.8 million bitcoins,\" the analyst said.\n\nConversely, the CryptoQuant analyst referred to on-chain data that showed the supply of bitcoin held by long-term holders has reached an all-time high, standing at 15.6 million bitcoins.\n\nHe added that long-term holders have a deeper belief in the asset and will hold and accumulate the asset.

        "title": "What is the Bitcoin Halving and Why Does it Matter? - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "During Bitcoin mining, the reduction in mining rewards is hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol and serves two main purposes: to control the supply of new Bitcoins entering circulation and to combat inflation.\n\nDemystifying Bitcoin Halving - The Core of Bitcoin's Scarcity\n\nBitcoin halving is considered one of the most significant events in cryptocurrency evolution. It involves reducing the rewards awarded to miners who play a vital role in securing the network.\n\nAs we approach the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected in April or May 2024, it is essential to comprehend the event's profound implications. This article seeks to answer the fundamental question: What is Bitcoin halving, and how it works?\n\nThe Foundation: Bitcoin's Blockchain Network\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin's underlying technology is crucial before diving into its mechanics. Bitcoin's blockchain is a complex network of computers called nodes. These nodes collectively run Bitcoin's software and maintain a comprehensive ledger of all historical transactions within the network.\n\nTransactions within the Bitcoin network undergo a rigorous validation process. Instead of being verified individually, transactions are grouped into blocks. Only when an entire block is validated are the transactions within it considered confirmed. As these transactions are validated, they become permanent additions to the blockchain, distributed among all nodes.\n\nHowever, more participating computers or nodes are added to enhance the blockchain's stability and security. While anyone with sufficient storage can become a node by downloading the entire blockchain history, not all nodes are miners.\n\nNow let\u2019s understand about Bitcoin halving and how it works.\n\nHalving Bitcoin: What is it and How Does it Work?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is a pivotal event in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies, occurring approximately every four years. This event, encoded into Bitcoin's very DNA, involves the halving of rewards for Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe fundamental purpose of Bitcoin halving is to combat inflation by preserving the cryptocurrency's inherent scarcity. In theory, the reduction in the rate of Bitcoin issuance is expected to lead to price appreciation, provided that demand remains constant.\n\nAt present, Bitcoin maintains an inflation rate of less than 2%, a figure that is set to further decrease with future halvings. Comparatively, in the US, the inflation rate for 2022 was 8%.\n\nBut how does this mechanism operate, and why does Bitcoin halving matter?\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Process\n\nIt is essential to understand Bitcoin mining in order to understand Bitcoin halving. Miners are pivotal participants who compete to add new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn order to achieve this, specialized hardware solves intricate mathematical problems, generating a unique 64-character output called a \"hash.\" Once the block is sealed, it becomes immutable and cannot be altered. As a reward for their efforts, miners are compensated with Bitcoin.\n\nSo, how exactly does the Bitcoin halving cycle function? The reward for successfully mining a block was 50 BTC at the time of Bitcoin's inception. Incentives like these were instrumental in motivating early users to join the network, even before its widespread success.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin's design incorporated a deliberate reduction in the rate of new Bitcoin creation, precisely halving it for every 210,000 blocks mined. This equates to approximately every four years.\n\nAccording to historical Bitcoin halving dates, the last three halvings occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020. The inaugural Bitcoin halving occurred in 2012, marking the reduction of mining block rewards from 50 to 25 BTC. Subsequent to this, the 2016 halving event further reduced incentives to 12.5 BTC for each block mined. As of May 11, 2020, every newly mined block generates a mere 6.25 new BTC.\n\nAnticipated in April 2024, the next Bitcoin halving will persist until roughly 2140, coinciding with the point at which all Bitcoin will have been mined.\n\nThe Purpose and Significance of Bitcoin Halving\n\nBut why does Bitcoin halving hold such pivotal significance? There are two primary reasons:\n\n1. Scarcity and Controlled Supply: Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, envisioned a digital currency with constrained and managed supply. Halving the mining rewards by half effectively diminishes the rate at which new Bitcoin is brought into existence. With escalating scarcity over time, Bitcoin becomes a deflationary asset in the long run.\n\n2. Inflation Control: Bitcoin halving plays an instrumental role in curbing excessive inflation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. By reducing the block reward, the process restricts the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the market. Controlled issuance maintains the long-term value and stability of the coin.\n\nAre you wondering why this Bitcoin halving represents a bullish trend in the crypto world? Let's find out.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhy Bitcoin Halving is Bullish\n\nMarket participants have consistently responded to halving events with fervent buying. The decrease in the inflation rate intensifies the pressure of demand, propelling Bitcoin's price upward.\n\nInterestingly, this phenomenon extends beyond Bitcoin, as other cryptocurrencies have experienced substantial gains during these periods, underlining the broader market's recognition of the bullish potential unlocked by Bitcoin halving.\n\nA Glimpse into Historical Halving Cycles\n\nNow, let's delve into the historical perspective by examining the price movements during each Bitcoin halving cycle:\n\nFirst Halving Cycle (November 2012 - July 2016):\n\nLowest Price: $12.4 (December 2012)\n\nHighest Price: $1,170 (November 2013)\n\nSecond Halving Cycle (July 2016 - May 2020):\n\nLowest Price: $535 (August 2016)\n\nHighest Price: $19,400 (December 2017)\n\nThird Halving Cycle (May 2020 - April 2024):\n\nLowest Price: $8,590 (May 2020)\n\nHighest Price: $67,450 (November 2021)\n\nAs we can see, halving events have historically correlated with Bitcoin's price surges. The anticipation of reduced supply and increased demand often generates positive market sentiment and potential price appreciation.\n\nIt is imperative, though, to bear in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results, and various factors beyond halving events contribute to Bitcoin's price dynamics.\n\n\u200d\n\nPredicting the Future of Bitcoin's Price: Insights from Experts\n\nAs the pioneer and largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin's price predictions garner substantial attention from experts and enthusiasts alike as the halving approaches. Lets delve into some of the diverse perspectives offered by prominent figures in the crypto space.\n\nBitQuant's Bullish Forecast: $250,000 Target\n\nBitQuant, a renowned social media commentator, has set an ambitious target for Bitcoin's price. According to this prediction, Bitcoin is expected to reach $250,000 after its next block subsidy halving.\n\nNo, #Bitcoin is not going to top before the halving.\n\nYes, it's going to reach a new all-time high before the halving.\n\nNo, #BTC is not going to $160K because the magnitude of every pullback is large. This means it will peak after the halving, in 2024. And yes, the target price is\u2026 pic.twitter.com/TRcEB4DFpF \u2014 BitQuant (@BitQua) September 15, 2023\n\nJesse Myers' Halving-Driven Outlook\n\nBitcoin investor and author Jesse Myers offers a more conservative outlook. Myers posits that Bitcoin will only breach the six-figure mark after its 2024 block subsidy halving. As a result, he believes that significant price movements might occur after this key milestone, as the market needs to fully \"price in\" the effects of the halving.\n\n#Bitcoin won't surge to $100k before the next halving...\n\n\n\nBecause the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is wrong.\n\n\n\nInstead, the market will price-in the changed reality over the 12-18 months post-halving. \u2014 Jesse Myers \ud83d\ude80 The Bitcoin Simplifier (@Croesus_BTC) August 14, 2023\n\nMarshall Beard, the chief strategy officer at crypto exchange Gemini, shared his optimism about Bitcoin's price trajectory. He believes that Bitcoin has the potential to surpass its all-time highs in the current year. In particular, he mentions the $100,000 figure, suggesting Bitcoin could achieve this milestone if it reaches its previous record high of nearly $69,000.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer at Tether, echoes this positive sentiment. He suggests that Bitcoin could \"retest\" its all-time high of around $69,000, signaling potential for price appreciation.\n\nStandard Chartered's Research-Based Prediction\n\nStandard Chartered, a prominent British multinational bank, has recently revised its prediction for Bitcoin's price. In one of its research reports, the bank anticipates Bitcoin's price to range between $100,000 to $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nThis upward revision is attributed to the bank's belief in increased profitability for Bitcoin miners. Additionally, the bank forecasts Bitcoin to reach $50,000 by the end of the current year.\n\nBold Visions from Samson Mow and Balaji Srinivasan\n\nSamson Mow, a Chinese-Canadian Bitcoin entrepreneur and CEO of crypto firm JAN3, envisions an even more remarkable future for Bitcoin. He firmly believes that Bitcoin will surge to an astonishing $1 million within the next five years.\n\nOn the other hand, Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former technology chief at Coinbase, has taken a daring bet on Bitcoin's price. He also speculates that Bitcoin could reach $1 million or more in the coming days.\n\n\u200d\n\nBitcoin Halving's Influence\n\nThe phenomenon of Bitcoin halving is far from a mere technical adjustment; it carries significant economic implications for Bitcoin miners and the broader cryptocurrency market. As the block reward is halved, miners are compelled to reconfigure their operations to maintain profitability. This intensified competition, however, leads less efficient miners to exit the scene, which can have far-reaching effects on security.\n\nCrypto experts acknowledge the current economic landscape characterized by rising hikes and tighter monetary policies, factors that might not facilitate an immediate, sharp rebound for Bitcoin.\n\nWhile some foresee Bitcoin reaching unprecedented heights, others adopt a more cautious approach. This diversity of perspectives adds to the intrigue surrounding Bitcoin's price trajectory, making investors and enthusiasts eager to see what comes next."

        "title": "Does Bitcoin or Crypto Mining Still Pay Off? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining, particularly Bitcoin mining, has long piqued the interest and investment of many. Individuals and corporations have been pulled into the field of crypto mining by the appeal of earning digital currencies by authenticating transactions on a blockchain network. However, as the crypto landscape changes and matures, the issue of whether Bitcoin or crypto mining will still be profitable in 2023 arises.\n\nCrypto Mining's Evolution\n\nTo comprehend the current situation of crypto mining, one must first identify its evolution. Mining could be done effectively with a regular computer in the early days of Bitcoin. Miners, or nodes, would utilize their processing capacity to solve challenging mathematical riddles and validate network transactions. In exchange, they were given Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, as the popularity of Bitcoin grew, so did the competition among miners. This resulted in the development of specialized hardware known as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which were developed specifically for mining. These ASICs were substantially more efficient than ordinary computers, making competition for small-scale miners increasingly difficult.\n\nBitcoin's Evolving Role: Can BTC be considered an ESG Asset?\n\nBitcoin, often described as peer-to-peer cash, digital gold, or a hedge against inflation, is beginning to emerge as an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) asset, according to a report by professional services firm KPMG. ESG is an investment framework aimed at promoting sustainable investments, and the convergence of Bitcoin and ESG represents a compelling shift in perspective.\n\nKPMG's report challenges traditional notions surrounding Bitcoin's energy consumption and environmental impact. The report suggests that Bitcoin can serve various ESG functions, including:\n\nCreating New Markets for Renewable Energy\n\nBitcoin miners have the flexibility to utilize various energy sources worldwide, including renewable sources like hydro, wind, geothermal, and solar. By tapping into underutilized renewable energy, Bitcoin can help reduce stranded energy and encourage further investments in clean energy.\n\nStabilizing Power Grids\n\nBitcoin miners can act as an energy buffer, absorbing excess energy when the grid faces oversupply and reducing consumption during periods of high demand. This flexibility benefits power providers by preventing grid overload and maintaining price stability for consumers.\n\nReducing Methane Emissions\n\nMethane, a potent driver of climate change, is emitted during landfill decomposition. Some companies are capturing vented methane from landfills and converting it into electricity for Bitcoin mining. This process not only reduces carbon emissions but also monetizes stranded energy, potentially revolutionizing landfill operations.\n\nThese emerging use cases challenge the narrative surrounding Bitcoin's environmental impact. Additionally, more than 50% of Bitcoin's power mix now comes from renewable sources.\n\nBitcoin's growing alignment with ESG principles is gaining attention from institutional investors like BlackRock and Fidelity, as they seek regulatory approval for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Correcting outdated narratives and recognizing Bitcoin's positive contributions to environmental and social challenges will be essential to onboard investors into the digital asset economy.\n\nThe Function of Halvings\n\nThe design of Bitcoin incorporates a mechanism known as \"halving,\" which limits the number of new Bitcoins created as mining rewards by 50% every four years on average. This halving is an important part of Bitcoin's monetary policy, which is intended to imitate the scarcity of precious commodities such as gold.\n\nThe economics of Bitcoin mining are significantly influenced by halvings. Miners must rely increasingly on transaction fees to sustain profitable as rewards decline. This has boosted rivalry among miners for higher-fee transactions, which may be financially rewarding but also unpredictable.\n\nEnergy Efficiency and Electricity Costs\n\nElectricity prices are one of the most important elements determining the profitability of crypto mining. Mining hardware requires a significant quantity of electricity to operate, and the cost of electricity varies substantially by region. Miners in low-cost electricity locations have a competitive advantage over those in high-cost electricity areas.\n\nBecause of its energy-intensive nature, crypto mining has sparked increased concern over its environmental impact in recent years. This issue has prompted efforts to make mining more energy-efficient and environmentally beneficial. Some cryptocurrencies, like as Ethereum, are shifting from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which uses substantially less energy.\n\nMining Sindicates and Decentralization\n\nMany individual miners join mining pools to boost their chances of receiving rewards. Mining pools are groups of miners who pool their processing resources to maximize their total odds of mining a block successfully. When a block is successfully mined, the rewards are dispersed among pool members according on the amount of processing power they supplied.\n\nMining pools provide more constant payments, but they also raise issues regarding centralization. As larger mining pools accumulate more power, they have the ability to dominate a major section of a cryptocurrency's network, thereby compromising cryptocurrency's decentralized ideals.\n\nConsiderations for Regulatory and Legal Compliance\n\nThe regulatory climate for cryptocurrency mining differs by nation and can have an impact on its profitability. Some countries have embraced cryptocurrency mining and offer tax breaks, while others have set stringent rules or outright prohibitions on mining activity.\n\nMiners must also consider environmental rules, especially in areas where energy sources are extensively regulated or subject to environmental impact assessments. Failure to comply with regulatory obligations might result in hefty fines and legal proceedings.\n\nMarket Conditions Are Important\n\nThe profitability of cryptocurrency mining is intimately related to the state of the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency prices, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, can move dramatically over short time periods. Miners frequently analyze their profitability by taking into account the current market price, as well as their electricity costs and mining hardware efficiency.\n\nA bull market with rising cryptocurrency prices can dramatically enhance mining profitability because miners can earn more from mining rewards as well as transaction fees. In contrast, a bear market with declining prices can put a pressure on profitability, particularly for miners with higher operating costs.\n\nThe Function of Altcoins\n\nWhile Bitcoin mining is the most well-known, thousands of other cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins, exist. Some of these altcoins have emerged as successful mining options. They may use alternative consensus techniques, utilize less electricity, or have more favorable reward systems.\n\nMiners that want to optimize their profits frequently diversify their mining activity to include a variety of cryptocurrencies. This method can assist them in adapting to shifting market conditions and capitalizing on opportunities given by various coins.\n\nIs it still worthwhile to mine cryptocurrency?\n\nThe answer to the issue of whether crypto mining is still worthwhile in 2023 is not one-size-fits-all. Mining profitability is determined by a variety of elements such as electricity prices, hardware efficiency, market conditions, and regulatory considerations. Mining is an industry that has changed dramatically since its beginning, and success demands careful preparation, continual adaptation, and a deep awareness of the ever-changing crypto ecosystem.\n\nCrypto mining is a viable and potentially rewarding endeavor for some, particularly when tackled strategically. Others may find that the expenses and dangers outweigh the possible gains. Those considering crypto mining should perform thorough research, examine their specific circumstances, and make informed decisions that match with their financial goals and risk tolerance, just like they would with any other investment."

The authority was referring to privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR), which allow users to obfuscate network transactions.\n\nRelated: Kazakh crypto miners plead with president to cut energy prices\n\n\u201cAll mining operations and services are only possible after obtaining a permitting document and license in the prescribed manner,\u201d the NAPP wrote, adding:\n\n\u201cThe agency also asks all citizens to act within the framework of the law and refrain from attempting to organize activities in the field of circulation of crypto-assets without obtaining the appropriate license.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the NAPP\u2019s latest crypto-mining document is a final decree establishing a framework for mining in Uzbekistan. The local government has issued multiple similar documents in recent years, repeatedly prohibiting individual miners from operating in Uzbekistan. One such decree was signed by Uzbekistan\u2019s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in April 2022, reiterating that local people cannot pay with crypto or mine digital currencies.\n\nThe NAPP did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: Minecraft bans Bitcoin P2E, iPhone 15 & crypto gaming, Formula E"

        "title": "Argo Blockchain Reports 34% Increase in Bitcoin Mining for September 2023 - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Argo Blockchain is joining the list of publicly traded cryptocurrency miners whose production increased in September. One of the main players in the crypto mining sector mined 136 Bitcoin or Bitcoin Equivalents (BTC) last month, averaging 4.5 BTC per day. This represents an uplift of 34% compared to August 2023. Additionally, the company saw an uptick of 23% in mining revenue, amounting to $3.59 million.\n\nA Closer Look at Argo's September Performance\n\nArgo Blockchain's September performance was bolstered by a reduction in power costs, thanks to accrued power credits from economic curtailment. These credits have reduced the company's electricity expenses and improved its mining margins and cash flow. The boost in BTC mined is primarily attributed to fewer curtailment hours at the company's Helios facility.\n\nHowever, the growth in Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term production was slightly offset by an increase of 4% in the average network difficulty in September compared to August. Despite this, the company enhanced its mining revenue by 23%, reaching $3.59 million for the month.\n\nAs of 30 September 2023, Argo Blockchain held 32 BTC in its reserves. This is a decrease from the 49 BTC it held at the end of August. The drop is mainly due to the periodic revaluation of the company's non-Bitcoin digital asset holdings.\n\nRegarding infrastructure, Argo completed the deployment of its BlockMiner machines in September. These machines contribute approximately 0.3 EH/s to the company's hashrate capacity at its Quebec facilities. With this addition, Argo's total hashrate Hash Rate A hash rate is the measure of a cryptocurrency miner\u2019s performance and a key security metric.

In addition, Finance Magnates reported yesterday (Wednesday) that Bitfarms Ltd. Successfully mined 411 BTC, representing an improvement of 7.3% from the previous month.\n\nWhile the growth compared to August is undeniable, the results are still considerably modest when compared to September of last year. Argo's report from September 2022 shows that the company mined 215 BTC, which is 79 more than the current figure.\n\nThe same applies to the previously mentioned Bitfarms. Although the company reached its highest production rate since May in September 2023, it was still 70 BTC less than the previous year. This has led more people to question whether cryptocurrency mining is still profitable."

        "title": "What are the EU's white paper requirements in MiCAR and do they apply to Bitcoin? - Osborne Clarke",
        "content": "The ground-breaking Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation will apply across the EU, but what will its impact be on established crypto-assets?\n\nAfter intensive discussions and compromises, the first comprehensive crypto regulation is here: the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation \u2013 MiCAR. MiCAR will regulate crypto-assets themselves, and also the services and products connected to them, in a harmonised way across the EU. In this article we focus on the new white paper obligation and how it will be applied to established crypto-assets like Bitcoin.\n\nThe development of MiCAR\n\nMiCAR is the European Parliament\u2019s response to citizens\u2019 expectations to set safeguards and standards for the use of blockchain technology, which was expressed in Proposal 35(8) of the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe.\n\nThe European Commission first presented MiCAR as a proposal on 24 September 2020 as part of the larger digital finance package, which aims to develop a harmonised European approach that ensures financial stability and consumer protection, while also fostering technological developments and innovation.\n\nPrior to MiCAR there were worries that the current legal framework could pose obstacles to the use of new digital financial instruments, and doubts as to whether certain new financial products and technologies would fall within the scope of active financial regulation in the EU. The new package addresses those concerns by ensuring that the current legal framework does not pose obstacles and that the new products and technologies will fall within the scope of financial regulation and risk management arrangements. The harmonised nature of the regulatory framework also adapts the regulation to the global nature of crypto markets and improves the current situation with national legislation in some Member States.\n\nOn 20 April 2023 the European Parliament officially endorsed MiCAR with 529 votes in favour (29 against). The legislative process concluded in the formal adoption of the regulation on 16 May 2023.\n\nMiCAR was officially published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 9 June 2023 as Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 on markets in crypto-assets, and amending Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010 and Directives 2013/36/EU and (EU) 2019/1937 (Volume 66, 9 June 2023, L 150, pages 40-205).\n\nOn 30 June 2024, two months after its publication, Titles III and IV, the regulations regarding asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens, shall apply. The other MiCAR provisions will apply 18 months after publication, on 30 December 30 2024.\n\nThe European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a first consultation paper about Technical Standards specifying certain requirements of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation on 12 July 2023. The aim of its paper is to collect views, comments and opinions from stakeholders and market participants on the appropriate implementation of MiCAR. It intends to publish further consultation packages in October 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\nScope of MiCAR\n\nCrypto-assets in general are defined in MiCAR as a digital representation of a value or a right that is able to be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technology (such as currency-tokens like Bitcoin or utility-tokens) (Article 3, paragraph 1 (5)).\n\nMiCAR generally is separated into titles concerning asset-referenced tokens (Title III), e-money tokens (Title IV) and crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens (Title II), as well as titles for definitions (Title I), conditions for crypto-asset service providers (Title V) and the prohibition of market abuse (Title VI).\n\nAsset-referenced tokens are a type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing another value or right or a combination thereof, including one or more official currencies, without being an electronic money token (e-money-token) (Article 3 paragraph 1 (6) MiCAR.) These tokens are usually referred to as stablecoins, for example, Tether or USDC, which reference the US dollar.\n\nElectronic money tokens or e-money tokens are a type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing the value of one official currency, see Article 3 paragraph 1 No. 7 MiCAR. The value of e-money tokens is backed by one fiat currency (e.g. Euro, US-Dollar).\n\nThe third category of crypto assets are the types of crypto-assets that do not fall into the category of asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens (see Title II).\n\nObligation to provide a crypto-asset white paper\n\nOne of the most important new provisions within MiCAR is the requirement for drawing up, notifying and publishing a crypto-asset white paper for asset-referenced tokens, e-money tokens and other crypto-assets.\n\nA crypto-asset white paper is an information document containing mandatory disclosures. It should contain general information on the issuer, offeror or person seeking admission to trading, on the project to be carried out with the capital raised, on the offer to the public of crypto-assets or on their admission to trading, on the rights and obligations attached to the crypto-assets, on the underlying technology used for such crypto-assets and on the related risks (see recital 24 MiCAR).\n\nIt is generally mandatory to draw up, notify and publish a crypto-asset white paper before offering crypto-assets to the public or seeking admission to trading of a crypto-asset.\n\nBaFin (the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) describes a white paper as a summary of the most important information about the offeror and the crypto-asset that is easy for everyone to understand.\n\nObligation for crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens\n\nIn general, as determined in Article 4 paragraph 1 MiCAR, a person shall not make an offer to the public of a crypto-asset (other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens) unless that person is a legal person and has drawn up, notified and published a crypto-asset white paper in accordance with Articles 6, 8 and 9 MiCAR.\n\nThe white paper requirements do not apply to an offer of crypto-assets: to fewer than 150 persons per Member State, or if the offer does not exceed \u20ac1 million over a period of 12 months starting with the beginning of the offer, or it is solely to qualified investors where the crypto-assets can only be held by such qualified investors (Article 4 paragraph 2 MiCAR).\n\nThe requirement for a white paper also does not apply, if the crypto-asset is offered for free (for example, airdrop) or as a reward for the maintenance of the DLT or validation of transactions (such as mining or staking) (Article 4 paragraph 3 MiCAR).\n\nThe offering of utility tokens providing access to a good or service that already exists or is in operation (serves as a voucher) is exempt from the white paper requirement (and all of Title II), according to Article 4 section 3 (c). The same goes for the offer of a crypto-asset if the holder of the crypto-asset has the right to use it only in exchange for goods and services in a limited network of merchants with contractual arrangements with the offeror (Article 4 section 3 (d)).\n\nThe rules for seeking admission to trading of crypto-assets are similar. Article 5 paragraph 1 MiCAR provides that a person shall not seek admission to trading of a crypto-asset if that person is not a legal person and has drawn up, notified and published a crypto-asset white paper in accordance with Articles 6, 8 and 9 MiCAR.\n\nThe requirement of a white paper does not apply to a crypto-asset that is already admitted to trading on another trading platform for crypto-assets in the EU and if the crypto-asset white paper is drawn up in accordance with Article 6, updated in accordance with Article 12, and the person responsible for drawing up such white paper consents to its use in writing (according to Article 5 paragraph 4 MiCAR).\n\nObligation for asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens\n\nThe white paper requirements for asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens are more stringent compared to the requirements for other crypto-assets.\n\nAny offer to the public or admission to trading for asset-referenced tokens requires a white paper (Article 16 paragraph 1, Article 19 and Article 21 paragraph 1 MiCAR). Even in cases where the issuer does not require an authorisation to offer the tokens to the public or seek its admission to trading (total value limited to \u20ac5,000,000 or offer limited to qualified investors), a white paper is required, according to Article 16 paragraph 2 and Recital (43) MiCAR.\n\nAny offer to the public or admission to trading of e-money tokens requires a white paper, according to Article 48 paragraph 1 (b) and Article 51 MiCAR. Even in cases where the issuer of e-money tokens is exempt from an authorisation to offer the tokens to the public or seek its admission to trading under the applicable electronic money framework (for example, limited networks), a white paper (and also the notification to the authority) to inform buyers about the characteristics and risk of the asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens is required (Article 48 paragraph 7 and recital (66) MiCAR).\n\nContent requirements for a crypto-asset white paper\n\nThe form and content of the white paper are also specified in MiCAR.\n\nCrypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens\n\nThe content requirements for white papers of crypto-assets (other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens) are detailed in Articles 5-8 MiCAR and their respective parts in Annex I.\n\nThe content and structure of a crypto-asset white paper is comparable to a securities prospectus under the European Securities Prospectus Regulation.\n\nThe white paper should start with the following statement \u201cThis crypto-asset white paper has not been approved by any competent authority in any Member State of the European Union. The [offeror][person seeking admission to trading][operator of the trading platform] of the crypto-asset is solely responsible for the content of this crypto-asset white paper.\u201d (Article 6, paragraph 3 MiCAR.)\n\nThis shall be followed by a statement from the management body of the offeror, the person seeking admission to trading or the operator of the trading platform confirming compliance with MiCAR and that the presented information is fair, clear and not misleading (Article 6, paragraph 6).\n\nAfter this statement, the white paper shall contain a summary which provides key information about the offer to the public of the crypto-asset or the intended admission to trading in brief and non-technical language, as well as a warning detailed in Article 6, paragraph 7 MiCAR.\n\nThe white paper shall be drawn up in an official language of the home Member State or in a language customary in the sphere of international finance (notably English) and should contain the date of its notification and a table of contents (Article 6, paragraph 8 (f)).\n\nIn addition to that, the white paper should provide information about the offeror or the person seeking admission to trading as well as the issuer, if different, and, in cases where it draws up the crypto-asset white paper, about the operator of the trading platform. This information includes the name, the legal form, the registered address, the date of registration, the legal entity identifier and a contact telephone number and email address, identity, business addresses and functions of persons that are members of the management body and business or professional activity of the offeror or the person seeking admission to trading as well as their financial condition over the past three years (Article 6, paragraph 1a, b, c, Annex I part A, B, C).\n\nFurther requirements include information about the crypto-asset project (such as name and brief description and past and future milestones of the project, details of all natural and legal persons), the crypto-asset itself (the type of crypto-asset and a description of its characteristics) and the underlying technology (including DLT, protocols and technical standards used) as well as the rights and obligations attached to the crypto-asset (that is, information on future offers to the public of crypto-assets and a description of the conditions under which the rights and obligations may be modified) (Article 6, paragraph 1 d, f, g, h, Annex I part D, F, G, H).\n\nThe white paper should also contain information about the offer to the public of the crypto-asset or its admission to trading (like reasons for the offer to the public, the amount that the offer intends to raise in funds, the issue price and the total number of crypto-assets), information on the risks (including a description of the risks associated with the offer, the issuer, crypto-assets and the technology used) and the principal adverse impacts on the climate (and other environment-related adverse impacts of the consensus mechanism used to issue the crypto-asset) (Article 6 paragraph 1 e, i, j, Annex I part E, I). The latter information requirement is a consequence of discussions about the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe provided information should be fair, clear and not misleading and presented in a concise and comprehensible form. The white paper should not contain material omissions, or any assertions as regards the future value of the crypto-assets (Article 6 paragraph 2, 4).\n\nMoreover, the white paper shall contain a clear and unambiguous statement, detailed in Article 6 paragraph 5 MiCAR, including a warning to the potential loss of value and, transferability and liquidity.\n\nAfter the white paper is drawn up, it must then be notified and published in accordance with Articles 8 and 9 MiCAR.\n\nAsset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens\n\nWhite papers for asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens have similar content requirements to papers for other crypto-assets.\n\nThe requirements for e-money token white papers, contained in Article 51 and Annex III MiCAR, are almost identical to those listed in Article 6 MiCAR for crypto-assets that are neither e-money tokens nor asset-referenced tokens. However, they need to contain specific information adapted to e-money tokens.\n\nThe white paper requirements for asset-referenced tokens are similar, but also require information on the reserve of assets (see Article 19 and Annex II MiCAR).\n\nApplication to established crypto currencies\n\nThe white paper requirement is easy to imagine for crypto-assets that will be issued and offered by a legal person when MiCAR will be applicable. However, a very interesting question is how the rules for a mandatory white paper will apply to Bitcoin and other crypto currencies that were already issued and traded on various platforms before MiCAR applies?\n\nBitcoin is considered a crypto-asset, pursuant to MiCAR, that is neither an asset-referenced token nor an e-money token. It therefore falls under the regulations under Title II MiCAR. According to Article 4 paragraph 1 (b)-(d) MiCAR, a person shall not make an \u201coffer to the public of a crypto-asset\u201d unless that person has drawn up, notified and published a crypto-asset white paper. The white paper obligation refers to the term \u201coffer to the public\u201d \u2013 a term also familiar from the securities prospectus regulation.\n\nAn \u201coffer to the public\u201d according to MiCAR means \u201ca communication to persons in any form, and by any means, presenting sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the crypto-assets to be offered so as to enable prospective holders to decide whether to purchase those crypto-assets\u201d (Article 3, paragraph 1 (12) MiCAR). The \u201cissuer\u201d or the \u201cofferor\u201d of crypto-assets is responsible for this public offer.\n\nFor Bitcoin, there is no issuer of the crypto-assets, but a trading platform could be deemed as an \u201cofferor\u201d. According to MiCAR an offeror is \u201ca natural or legal person, [\u2026] who offers crypto-assets to the public\u201d.\n\nAs the term \u201cofferor\u201d is also related to the securities prospectus regulation, it seems reasonable to have a look at existing interpretations of the term. Pursuant to Art. 2 (j) of the EU Securities Regulation, the offeror is any legal entity or natural person who offers securities to the public and thus not necessarily the issuer. Offerors are also those who \u2013 in so-called distribution chains \u2013 resell securities. An offeror is anyone who is \"responsible for the public offering of the investment\" or at least shares responsibility and appears \"to the investors as an offeror that is recognisable from the outside\". However, mere sales assistants are not considered offerors (Assmann/Schlitt/von Kopp-Colomb, Prospektrecht Kommentar, \u00a7 9 WpPG Haftung bei fehlerhaftem B\u00f6rsenzulassungsprospekt, No. 81-83).\n\nA crypto trading platform \u2013 even if it offers proprietary trading with crypto assets \u2013 appears to the customers as a seller, but not as a responsible entity for the crypto assets itself (like Bitcoin). Typically, an offeror has an influence on the product and therefore a specific responsibly. A crypto trading platform has no influence or responsibly for the listed crypto currencies like Bitcoin and is therefore not deemed as an \u201cofferor\u201d. Listing crypto assets on a trading platform would not qualify as an offer to the public. This means there are no crypto-asset white paper obligations for a crypto trading platform under Article 4, paragraph 1 (b)-(d) MiCAR.\n\nIf a person seeks admission to trade crypto-assets, Article 5 paragraph 1 (b)-(d) MiCAR would generally require them to draw up, notify and publish a white paper. Contrary to what a first read of the Articles may suggest, the requirement for a white paper does not extend to all platforms that offer crypto trading, but only to multilateral trading platforms. The reason is that under MiCAR any admission to trading refers to an admission on a trading platform for crypto-assets within the meaning of Article 3, paragraph 1 (18) MiCAR. This provision refers to multilateral trading platforms bringing together multiple purchasing and selling interests in a pre-defined automated system.\n\nMost platforms that offer crypto trading do not provide a multilateral trading system but legally and technically operate as brokerage and/or proprietary trading services. Such platforms are therefore not multilateral \u201ctrading platforms for crypto-assets\u201d under MiCAR. As a consequence, the provisions containing white paper obligations in the case of an admission to trading do not apply for such trading platforms.\n\nHowever, in case the already-issued crypto-asset is to be traded on a multilateral trading platform for crypto-assets under MiCAR, a white paper is still required. In such cases MiCAR also offers the possibility of white paper reliance, under Article 5, paragraph 4. This requires that the crypto-asset is already admitted to trading on another (multilateral) trading platform for crypto-assets. Additionally, the white paper needs to have been drawn up in accordance with Article 6 and updated in accordance with Article 12, and the person responsible for drawing up the white paper needs to have consented to its use in writing."

Discover SCENE\n\nFormer BlackRock managing director Steven Schoenfield, who\u2019s now the CEO of MarketVector Indexes, gives the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \u201cthree to six months\u201d before it approves a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nSchoenfield gave his estimate during a panel discussion on ETFs at CCData\u2019s Digital Asset Summit in London yesterday, where he was joined by another ex-BlackRock director Martin Bednall, now CEO of Jacobi Asset Management.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSchoenfield was responding to comments made earlier by Bednall that \u201cthe SEC will probably approve [all ETF applications] at the same time; I don\u2019t think they want to give anybody first mover advantage.\u201d\n\nPreviously the MarketVector CEO said he would have given the industry \u201cnine to twelve months\u201d before an approval, but the SEC\u2019s recent decision to delay giving verdicts on several pending ETF applications is unlike previous delaying tactics by the regulator.\n\n\u201cInstead of completely rejecting the whole list, they've asked for comments, which is a marginal but significant improvement in the dialogue,\u201d says Shoenfield. \u201cThere's also the Grayscale lawsuit, which the SEC lost, which means they're most likely going to have to allow the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to be converted into an ETF.\u201d\n\nBlackrock, crypto and the Bitcoin ETF\n\nThrough its pending ETF application, traditional finance\u2019s top asset manager, BlackRock\u2014shepherding $9.42 trillion in assets-under-management (AUM)\u2014seems the likeliest contender to get a Bitcoin spot ETF approved.\n\nAfter all, it has a winning score of 575-1 when it comes to getting ETFs through the SEC.\n\nNobody would have seen it coming back in 2017 when BlackRock chief Larry Fink called Bitcoin an \u201cindex of money laundering.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFast forward to summer 2023: Fink appeared on FOX News and said that crypto \u201cis digitizing gold in many ways.\u201d\n\nDuring CCData\u2019s panel discussion in London yesterday, Martin Bednall said he believes in any case that the traditional financial muscle, in terms of both brand and resources, will give BlackRock a first-mover advantage should the SEC decide to start approving Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nShoenfield was more temperate in his views about their former company\u2019s foray into crypto.\n\n\u201cI disagree with my former colleague Martin. As much as Blackrock will try to crush the competition, there's a good half dozen, maybe eight or nine, other firms deeply committed to tradable digital assets,\" he said. \"They've all got applications in and some are actually much closer to the crypto ecosystem than than BlackRock. So I think Blackrock will be in for quite a fight.\u201d\n\nHe later added that his company has run the numbers and believes spot ETF approval may result in a \u201c$150 to $200 billion inflow\u201d into Bitcoin investment products over three years, which would \u201cdouble or triple the amount of AUM in current Bitcoin products.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) edged higher Wednesday, gaining 1.3% over the past 24 hours as headwinds in traditional markets alleviated and crypto markets calmed after Monday\u2019s sharp rally.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at around $27,700 during U.S. afternoon hours. Earlier this week, BTC briefly rose above $28,000 then pared some of its gains.\n\nCrypto services provider Matrixport\u2019s analysts noted Wednesday that BTC broke out from its downtrend starting in the summer and turned the $27,000 level into support.\n\nThe report said BTC\u2019s price could be headed toward $30,000. However, the initial surge on Monday lacked a significant follow-through, as BTC trading volume dropped to $11 billion from $19 billion.\n\nEnigma Securities, an institutional digital asset liquidity and advisory firm, forecasted Wednesday in a report that low volatility on crypto markets will prevail for the next months.\n\nMarkets will likely consolidate and chop sideways in October, extending the window for accumulation for long-term investors, Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, noted in a market report.\n\nThe broader crypto market-proxy CoinDesk Market Index inched 0.8% higher.\n\nTraditional markets calmed after a turbulent Tuesday session as fresh jobs data pointed to a cooling U.S. labor market.\n\nThe ADP reported earlier today that the U.S. economy added 89,000 jobs in September, significantly less than the 153,000 analysts expected and August\u2019s 180,000. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, noted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that this was the smallest rise in private sector jobs since 2020.\n\nThe S&P 500 index closed the day 0.8% higher, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index posted a 1.45% gain.\n\nEther (ETH) price underperformed and slid 0.7% as market participants digested the disappointing first days of the first futures-based exchange-traded funds in the U.S. K33 Research advised investors to rotate into BTC, citing the lack of medium-term catalysts for ETH.\n\nSolana\u2019s native token SOL also pared its gains from earlier this week, slumping 2.3% in the past 24 hours. The token is still up over 20% in a week.\n\nLayer 1 blockchain Avalanche\u2019s AVAX was a top performer among major cryptocurrencies, surging 7%. XRP also rallied over 3% earlier in the day as Ripple\u2019s Asian arm obtained a license in Singapore and a favorable court ruling."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) flipping full bull could come courtesy of the United States government, a new prediction says.\n\nIn an X thread on Oct. 4, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, eyed ballooning yields as a precursor to a new Bitcoin and crypto bull market.\n\nHayes: Bitcoin bulls should eye U.S. \u201cno way out\u201d moment\n\nU.S. Treasury yields are \u201cscreaming higher,\u201d and with that, Hayes believes that a macroeconomic flashpoint is only a matter of time.\n\nThe reason comes in the form of a so-called \u201cbear steepener,\u201d a phenomenon that describes long-term interest rates rising more quickly than short-term ones.\n\n\u201cWhy do I love these markets right now when yields are screaming higher?

More selling, begets more selling, which is no bueno for bond prices,\u201d Hayes continued.\n\nThe result should be clear \u2014 a return to mass liquidity injections, counteracting the quantitative tightening seen since late 2021, which has pressured crypto markets.\n\nFor Hayes, this cannot come without major casualties along the way. He concluded:\n\n\u201cThe faster this bear steepener rises, the faster someone goes belly up, the faster everyone recognises there is no way out other than money printing to save govt bond markets, the faster we get back to the crypto bull market :).

        "content": "In an interview with Tom Bilyeu, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, shared an insightful analysis of the future dynamics he believes will shape the Bitcoin price. At the heart of Hayes\u2019 argument is a complex interplay of global financial mechanisms.\n\nBitcoin Price May Reach $750,000\n\nHayes began by setting the stage for Bitcoin\u2019s near-term movement, stating, \u201cMy working model is that we are going to continue chopping around $25,000 to $30,000 this year.\u201d This forecast draws its foundation from the anticipation of impending financial disturbances and Hayes alluded to the consequences of negative real rates.\n\nWhen nominal rates, driven by government policies, hover between 6% to 10%, he expects a wave of diversification in investment strategies. Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, stand to gain significantly from such a shift. \u201cAs we get to some kind of financial disturbance and people realize that real rates are negative, if governments are growing nominal at 10%, 5%, 6%, though it\u2019s high, people at the market will start buying other stuff. Crypto is one of those things,\u201d Hayes remarked.\n\nDelving deeper into the dynamics, Hayes extrapolated his prediction into 2024. He mentioned, \u201cEither we face a financial crisis where rates plummet to zero, or we experience a slower increase in rates compared to government expenditure.\u201d In both scenarios, Hayes anticipates a bullish outcome for Bitcoin, seeing it touch around the $70,000 mark by the end of 2024.\n\nKey drivers, in his opinion, would be the Bitcoin halving event, an algorithmic reduction in Bitcoin rewards that traditionally impacts its price, and potential Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) launches by significant asset management giants in strategic global financial hubs, including the US, Europe, China (through Hong Kong).\n\nThe longer-term prediction, however, is where Hayes\u2019 vision becomes even more expansive. He articulated, \u201cThis is where the real fun starts. In my mental model we can go somewhere between $750,000 to $1,000,000 per Bitcoin in the 2026 timeframe. Whatever the number is, it\u2019s going to be a round number, just like Bitcoin hit $69,999. Then it is going down and gets crashed. 75% or 80%, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nHayes firmly believes that such an evolution will come amidst an unparalleled financial boom. Moreover, Hayes\u2019 analysis is not confined to Bitcoin. Drawing parallels, he suggests that this monumental financial growth will cascade across other major assets. Indicators such as the NASDAQ and S&P, he suggests, will also see record-shattering performances.\n\n\u201cI think it will be the biggest boom in financial markets we have ever seen in human history. Bitcoin will have a ridiculous price, Nasdaq will have a ridiculous price, S&P will have a ridiculous price. Pick your stock industry. [\u2026] Not just in crypto,\u201d Hayes predicts.\n\nMoney Printer To Go \u201cBrrrr\u201d Soon?\n\nOn a separate note, Hayes expressed his thoughts on the broader macroeconomic climate, specifically pointing toward the US Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy in a series of tweets on Wednesday. He conveyed a belief that if the Fed were to return to its aggressive money printing strategies, it could become a significant catalyst for Bitcoin\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nOne of Hayes\u2019 core focuses was on an emergent phenomenon in the bond market called the \u201cbear steepener.\u201d This scenario, wherein long-term bond interest rates rise faster than their short-term counterparts, often serves as a bearish indicator for stocks and riskier assets. Hayes, diving into the complexities of this pattern, remarked in one of his tweets, \u201cWhy do I love these markets right now when yields are screaming higher? Bank models have no concept of a bear steepener occurring.\u201d\n\nExpanding on potential outcomes of a rapid bear steepener evolution, Hayes highlighted the risks. \u201cThe faster this bear steepener rises, the faster someone goes belly up, the faster everyone recognizes there is no way out other than money printing to save government bond markets,\u201d he pointed out, suggesting a potential domino effect that could send Bitcoin, crypto and all financial markets soaring.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $27,619.\n\nFeatured image from South China Morning Post, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Wrapped Crypto Tokens, Explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is a wrapped token? Tokens are wrapped to make them usable on a different blockchain or in a particular environment to which they are not native. A wrapped token is a sort of cryptocurrency or digital asset that is backed by another coin or asset, often one that is native to a particular blockchain or network, or that is \u201cwrapped\u201d by it. But why are wrapped tokens important? Wrapped tokens are especially beneficial for cross-chain interoperability and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. They enable users to take advantage of the various features and services provided on several blockchains by allowing assets from one blockchain to be used easily on another. Depending on the exact use case and architecture of the wrapping mechanism, wrapped tokens can represent a broad variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and even nonfungible tokens (NFTs). For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is a well-known example on the Ethereum network. But what is Wrapped Bitcoin? WBTC represents Bitcoin (BTC) and enables users to communicate with Ethereum-based DeFi protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) while preserving Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value and characteristics.\n\nHow do wrapped tokens work? When working with platforms for decentralized applications and DeFi that utilize many blockchains, wrapped tokens are very helpful. Here\u2019s how wrapped tokens work: Asset locking A specific amount of the native coin of one blockchain (such as Ethereum) is \u201clocked\u201d into a smart contract in order to generate a wrapped token. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or a trusted entity usually keeps an eye on this locking procedure. To create wrapped tokens, the locked native coin is used as collateral. Issuance of wrapped tokens After the original cryptocurrency is locked, a corresponding number of wrapped tokens are created or released on a different blockchain (for example, a wrapped version of Bitcoin known as wBTC is released on the Ethereum blockchain). Within the ecosystem of the second blockchain, these wrapped tokens, which stand in for ownership of the locked native coin, can be freely traded.\n\nTypes of wrapped tokens Various types of wrapped tokens include wBTC, wETH, stablecoin equivalents and blockchain-specific wrapped tokens. Wrapped tokens are designed to operate in harmony with particular blockchain settings, enabling the fusion of many assets into a single ecosystem. Wrapped Bitcoin, one of the many varieties of wrapped tokens, is a prime example; it enables BTC owners to use their holdings in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications and on DeFi platforms. The Ethereum network is similarly made more efficient via Wrapped Ether (wETH), which facilitates trading and smart contract interactions. Similarly, stablecoins can be easily used across several blockchain ecosystems because of the wrapped equivalents of stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and Dai (DAI). Additionally, some blockchains host their own wrapped tokens, such as BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon, fostering cross-chain compatibility and enabling a variety of decentralized use cases. In the constantly changing cryptocurrency ecosystem, these tokens play a crucial role in bridging the gap between blockchain networks, improving liquidity, fostering interoperability and extending accessibility.\n\nWhat are the benefits of wrapped tokens? Wrapped tokens enhance cross-chain compatibility, liquidity and asset functionality, fostering a more interconnected and versatile cryptocurrency ecosystem. In the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, wrapped tokens offer advantages. Firstly, they promote cross-chain interoperability, enabling the seamless integration of assets from many blockchains into a specific ecosystem. This improves users\u2019 access to a greater variety of assets and liquidity. Secondly, wrapped tokens can make it easier to integrate assets with other functionality. For example, wBTC can be used to integrate Bitcoin into the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. They also standardize and simplify asset interactions, making them simpler to use. Additionally, wrapped tokens encourage decentralization by giving users more power over their assets. The utility, accessibility and adaptability of digital assets are significantly increased by these tokens across a variety of blockchain networks, encouraging a more connected and dynamic crypto economy."

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals becomes a hotbed of NFT trading, will the trend sustain? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ordinals grew faster in its early stages than NFTs launched on other networks.\n\nBitcoin clocked the third-highest NFT trading volume in the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nA year ago, nobody would have imagined Bitcoin [BTC] becoming a favored network for facilitating non-fungible token (NFT) transactions. However, things took a sharp turn in 2023 with Ordinals emerging as one of the year\u2019s biggest success stories in the blockchain space.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nOrdinals make a fantastic debut\n\nIn simple terms, Ordinals are NFTs that can be minted directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to NFTs on Ethereum [ETH], which point to off-chain data and rely on token standards to create a collection of tokens.\n\nOrdinals focus on BTC\u2019s smallest units, satoshis. The protocol allows users to inscribe each satoshi with data. This data can include smart contracts, which are then used to enable NFTs.\n\nIntroduced in January, Ordinals saw moderate growth in the first few months. However, the ecosystem has exploded since March, with nearly 35 million inscriptions getting minted until September, as per a report by blockchain analytics firm Galaxy Research.\n\nIt was worth noting that text-based inscriptions accounted for 95% of all mints. This was despite the fact that much of the hype surrounding Ordinals was fueled by digital artifacts or image-based files.\n\nHowever, when focusing just on image-based inscriptions, Bitcoin Ordinals grew faster in its early stages than NFTs launched on other networks.\n\nAs shown below, about 1.14 million digital artifacts were minted on Bitcoin during the first 200 days of activity. In contrast, Ethereum and Solana [SOL] experienced much slower minting activity on their respective networks since the debut of NFTs.\n\nOasis of growth amidst a NFT desert\n\nThe striking feature of Ordinals\u2019 growth trajectory was that it came during the NFT crypto winter. As part of the analysis, Galaxy Research noted,\n\n\u201cDespite the broader NFT market struggling to pull itself out of a bear market, Ordinals have gained significant traction and the idea of digital artifacts on Bitcoin has flourished.\u201d\n\nIndeed, NFT trade volumes dramatically plunged in 2023, with monthly figures steadily going downhill since the peak in February. However, amidst the gloom, Ordinals scripted a winning chapter.\n\nEvidently, Ordinals constituted 18% of all NFT volumes in May. And, although dropping out of the spotlight since then, Ordinals managed to provide a big impetus to Bitcoin\u2019s NFT activity.\n\nThe payments settlement network turned into a hot spot for trading digital artwork overnight. Bitcoin clocked the third-highest NFT trading volume in the first three quarters of 2023, eclipsing biggies like Polygon [MATIC] and trailing only Ethereum and Solana.\n\nOrdinals mania pushes up transaction fees\n\nOrdinals\u2019 frenzy also propelled network activity on the Bitcoin network to unprecedented levels. As mentioned earlier, Ordinals trading volume peaked in May, boosted majorly by the bulk minting of BRC-20 tokens.\n\nFor the uninitiated, BRC-20 is a token standard that enables users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network.\n\nBecause of the high demand for blockspace, a transaction jam choked the Bitcoin mempool. In fact, Galaxy Research noted that the jam hasn\u2019t cleared for about four months.\n\nThis was the longest running streak for a backlogged mempool since the bull run-induced spike in on-chain activity in 2021.\n\nThe increase in the number of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool prompted users to bid up fees in order to jump the queue. This is because miners would most likely include transactions with higher fees into the block and ignore the ones below a certain threshold.\n\nThe findings were verified by the dramatic increase in transactions and fees displayed in Glassnode\u2019s data above.\n\nA bright future ahead?\n\nWhile Ordinals had a promising debut, they still had a long way to go. Bitcoin\u2019s minting activity in the first 200 days was significantly less than other chains. The fact that other networks had experience and a well-developed ecosystem for NFT trades helped.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nMoreover, the BRC-20 standard was found to be an inefficient method to mint inscriptions as per the report. To make it easier for users, more efficient token standards were proposed.\n\nFurthermore, a substantial push was required to place a greater emphasis on minting image-based NFTs."

        "content": "A survey revealed that 87 per cent of Bitcoin owners frequently engage in cross-border remittances, highlighting the cryptocurrency's role in international money transfers.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted by tech firm Block founded by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, gathered data from 6,600 adults across 15 countries. It unveils insights into Bitcoin ownership, remittances, and global views on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe survey's key finding is the strong link between Bitcoin and remittance activity. Among Bitcoin owners, 87 per cent are part of households involved in cross-border remittances. This underscores Bitcoin's appeal for cost-effective and efficient international money transfers compared to traditional services.\n\nAdditionally, individuals engaged in remittances are more likely to own Bitcoin, with 8.9 per cent of them reporting ownership. This suggests that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred option for economical cross-border transactions.\n\nNotably, those involved in remittances are more optimistic about Bitcoin's future, with 56.2 per cent expressing optimism compared to 27.8 per cent among non-remittance participants. This implies that traditional banking's limitations, including data privacy and costs, are more apparent to those using it, making them open to Bitcoin.\n\nThe survey, spanning various countries, revealed consistent trends in Bitcoin ownership and remittance activity, emphasizing Bitcoin's growing role in facilitating cross-border money transfers.\n\nAs global connectivity increases, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are poised to play a more prominent role in cross-border remittances. Bitcoin's potential to offer faster, cheaper, and more private transactions aligns with the evolving needs of international money transfer participants.\n\nDespite varying regulatory and economic factors worldwide, Bitcoin's appeal as a tool for remittances remains strong, making a compelling case for its continued global adoption."
