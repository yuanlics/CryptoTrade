        "content": "Almost two years after pensioner Esther Freeman, who made around a million shekels (approximately $270,000) from Bitcoin, sued Bank Hapoalim on the grounds that it refused to allow her to deposit the profits into her account , the lawsuit against the bank has been dismissed. According to a request submitted on behalf of the parties to the Tel Aviv District Court, they declared that \"after a conversation between the plaintiff and the defendant bank, they reached an agreement according to which the lawsuit against Bank Hapoalim will be dismissed, and each party will bear its own expenses.\" Judge Limor Bibi approved the request on Sunday.\n\nSince filing the lawsuit, Bitcoin\u2019s price has fallen by around 50%.\n\n1 View gallery Esther Freeman. ( Photo: Haim Horenshtein )\n\nIn November 2021, Freeman filed a lawsuit against Bank Hapoalim, explaining that in 2013 she purchased Bitcoin in the amount of NIS 10,000 on the advice of family members. In July 2021, Esther asked to convert some of the Bitcoin, which was being traded at the time at around $58,000 into fiat money. \"I'm young in spirit,\" she said. \"I listened to my son and nephews and decided to give it a shot. I had no prior knowledge on the matter and was completely naive. I never dreamed that NIS 10,000 could become almost NIS 1 million.\"\n\nHowever, the fairytale story didn\u2019t reach a happy ending. Freeman filed a lawsuit at the Tel Aviv District Court in November 2021 through attorneys Shaul Zioni and Lior Kiperman of the Zioni, Pillersdorf, Phillip Advocates law firm against Bank Hapoalim after it refused to deposit the funds she amassed through her Bitcoin investment. Freeman has held an account at the bank for the past 40 years, but the bank claims that it refuses to accept the funds as Freeman had purchased the Bitcoin in cash, and therefore it has no way of verifying the money route.\n\n\"The characteristics of digital currencies allow for them to be transferred in an anonymous and unregulated manner, many times circumventing the need to use financial institutions who are under anti-money laundering and terror financing regulations, and therefore this is an activity that carries a high risk of anti-money laundering and terror financing,\" the bank wrote in a letter sent to Freeman.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, the bank filed a statement of defense through attorney Meir Lefler. The bank claimed, among other things, \u201cthat on the relevant dates, and even at the time of writing these lines, the position of the Supervisor of Banks is that the banking system should not be required to accept funds originating from virtual currencies, and this in light of the risk involved in exploiting this means for money laundering and terrorist financing.\"\n\nAs part of the statement of defense, Bank Hapoalim explained that according to \"Freeman's explanations, it is not possible to trace the money path in relation to the purchase of the virtual currency\u201d and that \u201conly in cases where the funds used to purchase the virtual currency were withdrawn and received in the same account can the receipt of the funds be approved.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank also stated that Freeman did not make the purchase from a recognized and/or supervised entity but from a private individual in cash. The bank claimed that under the aforementioned circumstances, the bank should not be forced to accept funds originating in virtual currency contrary to its risk management in this area. On the other hand, the pensioner claimed that the bank's claims are unfounded. As mentioned, today the court, with the consent of the parties, ordered the deletion of the claim against the bank.\n\nBank Hapoalim stated: \"The lawsuit against the bank has been dismissed. The bank acted from the beginning in accordance with its obligations according to law, including the Anti-Money Laundering Law.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat on Monday morning in Asia, staying just above the US$29,000 support level, while the token\u2019s volatility rating hit a record low. Ether also treaded water, as other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed with Solana leading the winners. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged lower and U.S. stock futures moved up following losses last week. Investors now await another busy week of corporate earnings reports and U.S. inflation data.\n\nBitcoin flat, volatility low\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.03% in the last 24 hours to US$29,039.48 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong and down 0.78% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly traded below the US$29,000 support level over the weekend.\n\nEther also dipped 0.48% to US$1,826, and moved down 1.89% over the past seven days.\n\n\u201cThe most fluctuation in Bitcoin over the last week and a half has been around US$29,200. And this is interesting because during this time, the dollar has gone into a growth mode, and there has been significant profit-taking in the equity market,\u201d wrote Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based online brokerage FxPro.\n\n\u201cThe market has been waiting for new signals, equally ready to return to growth or continue to fall,\u201d Kuptsikevich said. \u201cA drop below US$28,800 could quickly take the market to US$28,000 or even US$27,000. A rise above US$29,500 would open a quick path to US$30,000 and on to US$31,000.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin volatility index by crypto options trading platform Deribit, which indicates the expected volatility for Bitcoin over the next 30 days, hit an all-time-low of 34.02% on Monday. Meanwhile, crypto analytics firm K33 Research noted on Friday that Bitcoin\u2019s 5-day average volatility dropped lower than Gold, Nasdaq and S&P500 in the week ending July 30.\n\nBitcoin's volatility dropped lower than Gold, Nasdaq and S&P500 last week \ud83d\udcc9\n\n\n\nHistorically, such periods of low volatility have often been followed by surges in BTC volatility. Could this indicate an imminent price movement for bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/EvGYNd3tJI \u2014 K33 Research (@K33Research) August 4, 2023\n\n\u201cThis session is symptomatic of something we\u2019ve seen playing out over the past few months but is even more pronounced now: nothing,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen BTC make a 1%+ move from open to close in what feels like forever.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth checking with oneself for any hint of complacency; crypto markets typically don\u2019t reward inertia. Investors will find it very hard to position themselves, though, as positive news about crypto ETFs and engagement by institutions are balanced by regulatory woes and DeFi hacks,\u201d added d\u2019Anethan.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed as Solana led the winners. It gained 2.51% to US$23.18, but logged a weekly loss of 4.47%.\n\nDogecoin led the losers, falling 1.97% to US$0.07418, down 4.92% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.12% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while trading volume gained little, adding 1.42% to US$20.62 billion.\n\nMore doom and gloom for NFT developers\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.28% in the past 24 hours to 2,459.91 as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 3.34% for the week. However, Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes all logged losses, with only the Cardano index moving higher.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 12.78% in the past 24 hours to US$14.78 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nBy NFT collections, Mythos Chain-based game NFT marketplace DMarket posted the largest 24-hour trading volume. Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained Cards made up the second and third place spots.\n\nWreck League, an NFT-based fighting game backed by Web3 venture capital and game development firm Animoca Brands, announced a licensing agreement with BAYC developer Yuga Labs on Thursday.\n\n\ud83d\udcfaTake a closer look at our first collaboration with @yugalabs and discover the exclusive advantages of being part of the next generation of fighting games!\n\n\n\n\u25b6\ufe0fPowered by @apecoin \ud83e\uddbe pic.twitter.com/pvxAQHLTTf \u2014 Wreck League \u27a1\ufe0fALLOWLIST OPEN! (@WreckLeagueHQ) August 4, 2023\n\nThat agreement will see Yuga Labs\u2019 NFT collections incorporated into the game. The game will be launched in September.\n\nAccording to a Sunday report by the Bored Ape Gazette, a news site funded by the ApeCoin DAO, Wreck League\u2019s in-game NFTs will be minted exclusively with ApeCoin. ApeCoin is the governance and utility token used in the Yuga Labs ecosystem.\n\nFollowing the news, ApeCoin\u2019s price rose to a weekly high of US$2.04 on Sunday, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning Saturday about NFT phishing scams. The FBI claims that fraudsters, posing as NFT developers, are using fake social media accounts to trick users into linking their digital wallets to smart contracts that extract their digital funds.\n\nAnd the bad news for developers isn\u2019t over.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report published Saturday, total NFT royalties received by creators plunged from US$269 million in January 2022 to only US4.3 million in July 2023.\n\nA significant decline in NFT trades coupled with competition between NFT marketplaces OpenSea and Blur has drastically driven down royalty rates. The total NFT trading volume fell more than 90% over the same period, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nU.S. labor market cools\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:10 p.m. on Monday in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower in regular trading last Friday and ended the week with losses.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes moved down on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nThe U.S. economy added 187,000 payrolls in July, lower than analyst expectations. Hourly average wages also logged a higher-than-expected increase of 4.4%, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nThat data points to a cooling U.S. labor market. However, wage inflation is still double the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s target level.\n\n\u2018Today\u2019s numbers will do little to change the narrative of the Fed. The earnings numbers in particular will be of concern to the \u2018hawks\u2019 on the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) and will do nothing to dissuade them from arguing for another interest rate hike at September\u2019s meeting,\u201d Stuart Cole, Equiti Capital\u2019s head macro economist told Reuters.\n\nInvestors now await the U.S. July consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday and producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Both reports will provide insight into U.S. inflation and the direction of the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed meets on September 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance for no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 17.5% on Friday.\n\nThis week will also be busy with second-quarter earning reports from major corporations including Walt Disney, Alibaba Group Holdings and Honda Motor.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s imports and exports data is expected Tuesday, as well as the country\u2019s CPI and PPI on Wednesday. Analysts expect the Chinese CPI and PPI to pose annual decreases in July.\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"

        "title": "Lost Bitcoins: \u201cThink of It as a Donation to Everyone\u201d - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto said lost Bitcoins \u201conly make everyone else\u2019s coins worth slightly more.\u201d To his credit, it\u2019s hard to disagree.\n\nBut how does Bitcoin (BTC) even get lost in the first place? Everyone and their dog knows that backing up your private keys and seed phrase is the first thing you do when you create a crypto wallet. Are Bitcoin users really that careless?\n\nHow much BTC has already been condemned to collect cobwebs and dust in inaccessible addresses until the end of time?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore the fate of these lost, but not forgotten, digital assets and their impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nWhat Happens to Lost Bitcoins?\n\nIn the labyrinth of the digital world, lost Bitcoins find themselves in limbo. Until the death of the network itself, misplaced BTC lies dormant on the blockchain, the public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions.\n\nWhen Bitcoins are lost, they essentially become inaccessible. This typically happens when the private keys or recovery phrases to a Bitcoin wallet are forgotten, cast aside, or missing in action.\n\nWithout these keys, bitcoins are doomed to remain in their respective wallets, untouched and unmovable, like a locked vault whose key has been misplaced.\n\nTo rub salt into the wound, these lost Bitcoins are not removed from the total supply count. They continue to exist on the blockchain but are effectively removed from circulation, as they can no longer be spent, sold, or traded.\n\nHow Many Bitcoins Are Lost?\n\nLike counting stars in the sky or grains of sand at the beach, counting the number of Bitcoins rumored to be lost forever is no easy task.\n\nChainalysis, a leading blockchain research firm, speculates that up to 20% of the total supply of Bitcoins may be lost forever. Of course, this isn\u2019t an exact science. According to the firm, any Bitcoin wallet that hasn\u2019t signed a transaction in the last five years is considered \u2018lost,\u2019 along with any remaining Bitcoin still inside.\n\nThis translates to a rough estimate of around four million BTC, a staggering figure considering that the total supply of Bitcoins is capped at 21 million. As the years go by, the number of lost Bitcoins continues to rise, adding another layer of mystery and intrigue to the enigmatic world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow Bitcoin Gets Lost\n\nToday, the idea of accidentally losing such a valuable asset seems ridiculous. However, the loss of these digital assets is more common than one might think and can occur in several ways.\n\nForgotten or Lost Private Keys\n\nThe most common cause of Bitcoin loss is people forgetting their private keys or seed phrases, essentially digital passwords granting access to a Bitcoin wallet. If a user forgets these keys or loses the device where the key is stored, the Bitcoins within the wallet become inaccessible.\n\nDeath of the Bitcoin Owner\n\nIn some unfortunate instances, a Bitcoin owner may pass away without leaving behind the necessary information to access their digital wallet. If this happens, their Bitcoin wallet becomes completely inaccessible.\n\nHardware Failure or Loss\n\nBitcoins are often stored in hardware wallets, physical devices designed to store private keys offline securely. However, if these devices are damaged, lost, or stolen, and the owner has not backed up their seed phrase, the BTC stored on the device can be lost.\n\nSending to Incorrect Addresses\n\nBlockchain transactions are irreversible. If a user accidentally sends BTC to the wrong address, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll never get them back. This can happen if a user mistypes the address or their computer is infected with malware that alters the copied address.\n\nUnused Wallets\n\nSome early Bitcoin mining enthusiasts or buyers purchased BTC when it was worth mere cents and then forgot about them. As the value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, like Ethereum (ETH), rose, some users found they had lost access to their wallets.\n\nThe most tragic example of this tells the story of James Howells, who threw away 8,000 BTC after accidentally tossing a hard drive in the trash. Today, this hard drive holds over $250 million worth of Bitcoin, crushed underneath mounds of rubbish in a landfill.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Bitcoin\u2019s Price?\n\nUnlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins. BTC\u2019s scarcity and inflation resistance are critical factors underpinning its value. What happens when a portion of this already limited supply becomes inaccessible?\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Economics 101. In simple economic terms, when the supply of an asset decreases while demand remains constant or increases, the price of that asset tends to rise. Like the Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn mechanism, lost crypto assets are permanently removed from the circulating supply.\n\nAs more Bitcoins are lost, the available supply decreases. If demand continues to grow, this could put upward pressure on the price of Bitcoin and fulfill Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s lost Bitcoin prophecy.\n\nHow to Avoid Losing Your Bitcoin\n\nIf it was apparent already, safeguarding your digital assets becomes increasingly critical. Here are some strategies to prevent your Bitcoin from becoming part of the lost bounty.\n\nBack up your private keys and seed phrase \u2013 These codes are the lifeline to your digital assets. Store them securely and make sure they are backed up in multiple locations. Consider using hardware wallets, which store your keys offline and are immune to online hacking attempts.\n\n\u2013 These codes are the lifeline to your digital assets.

Learn about potential scams, and never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone.\n\n\u2013 Hackers and scammers come in many shapes and forms. What do they all have in common? They want your BTC. Learn about potential scams, and never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone. Plan for the Unexpected \u2013 Make a plan to ensure your loved ones can access your Bitcoins. Most crypto exchanges offer estate planning and crypto inheritance services.\n\nIs Lost Bitcoin Recoverable?\n\nI hate to tell you this but lost Bitcoin cannot be recovered in most cases. Once the private keys to a Bitcoin wallet are lost, the Bitcoins within that wallet become inaccessible and are effectively lost forever. This is due to the cryptographic security measures inherent in blockchain technology, which make it impossible to access a wallet without the correct private keys.\n\nIf you have lost access to your BTC, like you\u2019ve misplaced your hardware wallet or forgotten your password, don\u2019t lose hope! If you\u2019ve backed up your seed phrase somewhere, you can recover your Bitcoin.\n\nProfessional data recovery services also attempt to recover lost Bitcoins, especially in cases where a user remembers part of their password or has an old computer or storage device that might contain traces of the lost keys.\n\nWhile recovering lost Bitcoins in specific scenarios is technically possible, it\u2019s generally a complex and uncertain process. When it comes to securing your digital wealth, prevention is the best defense.\n\nPros and Cons of Lost Bitcoin\n\nThe phenomenon of lost Bitcoin has positive and negative implications for the ecosystem and its users.\n\nPros\n\nIncreased Scarcity \u2013 Lost Bitcoins effectively reduce the circulating supply of the world\u2019s largest digital asset. By the laws of supply and demand, this could potentially drive up the price, benefiting those who hold Bitcoin.\n\n\u2013 Lost Bitcoins effectively reduce the circulating supply of the world\u2019s largest digital asset. By the laws of supply and demand, this could potentially drive up the price, benefiting those who hold Bitcoin. Security Lessons \u2013 The irreversible loss of Bitcoin is a crucial reminder of the importance of security in the digital asset space. It encourages us to adopt better security practices, such as secure storage of seed phrases and private keys.\n\nCons\n\nReduced Market Liquidity \u2013 Lost Bitcoins decrease the remaining BTC available for trading. This could potentially boost price volatility, making the cryptocurrency market susceptible to manipulation.\n\n\u2013 Lost Bitcoins decrease the remaining BTC available for trading.

Self-custody is intimidating and can be daunting for people accustomed to traditional financial systems. Loss of Value \u2013 For the individuals who lose their Bitcoins, the loss can be financially devastating, especially given the increasing value of Bitcoin.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIf an early adopter wallet that was previously thought to be \u2018lost\u2019 were to be recovered, the owner could find themselves holding an immense allocation of BTC. This could have a disastrous effect on the crypto market if they decided to dump all their holdings. Imagine if Satoshi Nakamoto suddenly reappeared and sold 1M BTC?\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nLearning about the consequences of losing access to your crypto wallet is the perfect incentive to tighten your own blockchain security and back up your seed phrase. If you haven\u2019t already done it, let this serve as a timely reminder!\n\nFAQs"

Certainly, $1.48 million sounds like an outlandish forecast, even for Bitcoin. After all, Bitcoin is still trading around $30,000, nearly 60% below an all-time high of $68,789. But Wood says she has the numbers to back up her assertions, so let's dig in.\n\nBitcoin as safe haven\n\nAccording to Wood, Bitcoin is the perfect \"insurance policy\" for an uncertain economic world. What convinced her more than anything was Bitcoin's performance during the regional banking crisis earlier this year, when Bitcoin skyrocketed from $19,000 to $30,000. That nearly 60% gain signified to Wood that Bitcoin was increasingly being viewed as a safe haven in an unsafe world. During any \"flight to safety,\" investors would rush to move their money into Bitcoin.\n\nIn short, Bitcoin is once again being viewed as \"digital gold.\" Before the 2022 crypto market meltdown, it was commonplace to talk about Bitcoin as an alternative to physical gold, and as the ultimate store of value. According to Wood's bull case scenario, Bitcoin will eventually have a 50% share of the \"store of value\" market once dominated by gold.\n\nThat figure might sound high, but it lines up with what Goldman Sachs Group (GS 1.06%) predicted at the start of 2022. Back then, Goldman Sachs predicted that Bitcoin would eventually account for a larger and larger share of this market, rivaling gold. Based on that prediction, Goldman Sachs set a Bitcoin price target of $100,000.\n\nBitcoin and institutional investors\n\nCathie Wood's valuation model for Bitcoin also includes some key assumptions about the behavior of institutional investors. The key metric to watch here is their asset allocation to crypto, and specifically, Bitcoin. In her firm's bear case scenario for Bitcoin, this allocation stands at a relatively paltry 1%. But it climbs to 2.5% in the base case scenario, and then skyrockets to 6.5% in the bull case scenario.\n\nThe recent rush to file spot Bitcoin ETF applications with the SEC is perhaps the best sign yet of potential new institutional investor interest in Bitcoin. In mid-June, BlackRock (BLK -0.43%) led the way with a spot Bitcoin ETF filing. Soon after, Ark Invest followed with an amended application for a similar type of spot Bitcoin ETF filing. No surprise here, but Bitcoin rallied hard in June after these announcements. These spot Bitcoin ETF filings were supposedly going to unlock a tsunami of new money into Bitcoin, pumping up the price of this crypto.\n\nAre these forecasts accurate?\n\nWhat's interesting is how two relatively small assumptions -- that Bitcoin will rival gold as a store of value, and that Bitcoin will represent a larger share of institutional asset allocations -- can lead to the monumental assumption that Bitcoin will soon be worth over $1 million.\n\nFrom my perspective, the assumption about the behavior of institutional investors is the most important. As Ark Invest noted in its February report, there has been an absolute sea change in the way that institutional investors think about crypto. Some big-time investors, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, are now very much aboard the crypto train. Their clients are demanding greater access to crypto, and they are now attempting to meet that need.\n\nWhat to look for next\n\nIn terms of what's next for Bitcoin, I'm keeping my eyes on how Bitcoin fares amid the economic uncertainty. I'm not quite ready to buy into the idea that Bitcoin is a \"safe\" investment, and certainly not after what we saw during the crypto winter of 2022, when Bitcoin lost nearly 65% of its value. But if there is another flare-up of the regional banking crisis, and investors behave the same way that they did earlier this year, I might be convinced.\n\nLong-term, I'm bullish on Bitcoin. It might not reach $1.48 million by 2030, as Cathie Wood and Ark Invest are predicting, but it's almost certainly going up over the next decade. If institutional adoption rates skyrocket, then Bitcoin could be off to the races."

        "title": "SHIB, UNI, OKB and HBAR flash bullish signs as Bitcoin volatility hits record low - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) continued its boring price action over the weekend, indicating that the bulls and the bears are not waging large bets as they are uncertain about the next directional move. Nevertheless, traders should continue to keep a close watch because a period of consolidation is usually followed by an increase in volatility.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty, some analysts point to the Bitcoin whales increasing their exposure as a positive sign. On-chain analyst Cole Garner believes the bull move could begin in September when the summer seasonality kicks in and the shakeout happens.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin rose sharply in the first few months of the year but the major altcoins struggled to keep pace. That could change as the current consolidation in the largest cryptocurrency is giving an opportunity for select altcoins to play catch up.\n\nWhat are the top five cryptocurrencies that are looking positive in the near term? Let\u2019s study their charts to determine the resistance levels to keep an eye on.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on Aug. 5, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. The price is getting squeezed between the 20-day exponential moving average ($29,430) and the horizontal support at $28,861.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory indicate that bears are at a slight advantage. Sellers will try to yank the price below the $28,861-to-$28,585 support zone. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could start a downward move to $26,000.\n\nConversely, if the price rebounds off the current level and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average ($29,840), it will suggest the start of a recovery to the overhead resistance zone between $31,804 and $32,400.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls have been defending the support at $28,861, but a negative sign is that they haven\u2019t been able to achieve a strong rebound off it. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.\n\nThe 20-EMA is turning down gradually and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting that the bears have a minor advantage. The sellers will have to sink and sustain the price below $28,861 to resume the short-term down move.\n\nIf bulls want to start a recovery, they will have to drive and sustain the price above the moving averages. If they do that, the pair could climb to the stiff overhead resistance at $30,000. A break and close above this level could open the doors for a further rally to $31,000.\n\nShiba Inu price analysis\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) broke and closed above the overhead resistance of $0.0000085 on Aug. 4, indicating that the bulls are trying to start a new uptrend.\n\nSHIB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bullish momentum picked up further on Aug. 5 and the SHIB/USDT pair soared to $0.000010. This move sent the RSI into the overbought territory, indicating that a minor correction or consolidation is possible.\n\nIf the bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will signal that traders are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If the price breaks above $0.000010, the pair may surge to $0.000012 and then to $0.000014.\n\nSHIB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to arrest the decline at the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the current level with strength, the bulls will again try to push the price to $0.000010. A break above this level could signal the resumption of the up-move.\n\nInstead, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that traders are aggressively booking profits. A break below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000009 could open the doors for a potential fall to $0.0000085.\n\nUniswap price analysis\n\nUniswap (UNI) has been in a correction for the past few days but a positive sign is that the bulls are trying to arrest the decline near the 20-day EMA ($6.04).\n\nUNI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the price rebounds off the current level with strength, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and the traders are using the dips to buy. The UNI/USDT pair could first rise to $6.70 and if this level is crossed, the next target could be $7.50.\n\nAnother possibility is that the price sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, it will suggest that the up-move has ended. The pair could then descend to the 50-day SMA ($5.58) where buying may emerge.\n\nThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nUNI/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA has turned down, and the RSI is in negative territory, indicating that the bears have the upper hand. If the price continues lower and breaks below $5.93, the correction may resume. The next support on the downside is $5.66.\n\nContrarily, if bulls propel the price above the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The pair may first rise to the 50-SMA and if this level is taken out, the up-move may reach $6.70.\n\nRelated: XRP price disappoints after court ruling, Deaton remains optimistic\n\nOKB price analysis\n\nOKB (OKB) has been gradually falling inside a large range between $38 and $59 for the past several weeks. The bulls pushed the price above the downtrend line on Aug. 4, indicating that the short-term downtrend may be ending.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($43) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the bulls have the upper hand. Buyers will try to propel the price to $48 and subsequently to $50. This level may act as a major hurdle but if crossed, the pair could quickly jump up to $54.\n\nContrary to this assumption, a slide below the downtrend line will indicate that the attempt to start an up-move fizzled out. The bears will gain further strength if they sink the OKB/USDT pair below the moving averages. The pair could then slump to $41.\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears tried to tug the price back below the downtrend line, but the bulls successfully held the level. This suggests that the buyers have flipped the downtrend line into support. The pair could first rise to $46, and if this obstacle is overcome, the next target could be $48.\n\nThe 20-EMA is an important support to watch out for. If the price plunges below the 20-EMA and the downtrend line, it will suggest that bears are back in command. The pair may then tumble to $42.\n\nHedera price analysis\n\nHedera (HBAR) broke above the overhead resistance of $0.055 on Aug. 6, indicating that bulls are attempting a comeback.\n\nHBAR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf buyers sustain the price above $0.055, it will signal the start of a new up-move. There is a minor resistance at $0.062 but if this level is crossed, the HBAR/USDT pair could pick up momentum. The pair could first rise to $0.065 and thereafter attempt a rally to $0.075.\n\nThe important level to watch on the downside is $0.055. If bulls flip this level into support, it will indicate a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 50-day SMA ($0.05). That could sink the pair to $0.045.\n\nHBAR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $0.055. This completed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective of $0.07.\n\nThe sharp rally has pushed the RSI into deeply overbought territory, indicating that a minor correction or consolidation is possible. On the downside, $0.055 is the critical level to keep an eye on.\n\nIf bears want to prevent this up-move, they will have to yank the price below the breakout level of $0.05. The pair could then plunge to $0.045.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin price has cautiously ratcheted upward since Jan. A rising trend channel from $16,600 to $30,000 almost doubled the spot price of BTC in H1.\n\nThe price changed in three phases, with blistering rallies that happened in January, March, and June.\n\nHere\u2019s what large language model chatbot Google Bard has to say about the best day of the week to buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple.\n\nCheapest Day of the Week to Buy Crypto?\n\nThere\u2019s no telling for sure if markets will cool down for now or soar higher in the short term.\n\nInvestors looking to accumulate crypto in regular small increments for the long term, however, might consider making Saturdays their go-to weekday for stacking sats.\n\nBuying a set amount of crypto or stocks on a weekly schedule is a classic investing strategy called dollar cost averaging.\n\nGoogle Bard says Saturdays are the second-best day of the week to buy crypto. But if you\u2019re looking for the cheapest prices, the best day of all to buy crypto, according to Bard, is Sunday.\n\nHere was Google Bard\u2019s entire answer\n\nQuestion: \u201cBard, what is the best day of the week to buy cryptocurrency?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to historical market data, the best day of the week to buy cryptocurrency is Sunday. The second best day is Saturday. After that, prices rise with Friday being the most expensive day to buy cryptocurrency. Here are some of the reasons why Sunday is considered the best day to buy cryptocurrency: Trading volumes are typically lower on weekends, which can lead to lower prices.\n\nThere is less news and volatility on weekends, which can also lead to lower prices.\n\nSome investors may be taking profits on Friday, which can drive prices down on Saturday and Sunday. Of course, there is no guarantee that the price of cryptocurrency will be lower on Sunday. The market is volatile and prices can go up or down at any time. However, if you are looking to buy cryptocurrency at a relatively low price, Sunday is a good day to start your search.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what the numbers say to back up Bard\u2019s answer:\n\nPsst: Bitcoin price goes on sale 1% Sundays\n\nBitcoin price averaged lower from Saturdays through Mondays over the last year of trading. An analysis of the historical daily price data suggests Fridays through Mondays are the best days to buy crypto.\n\nTuesdays and Wednesdays are the best days to sell, the data suggest.\n\nThe lowest average daily high price for any day of the week for Bitcoin from Aug 5, 2022 \u2013 Aug 3, 2023, was on Sundays. Over this time period, BTC\u2019s average intraday high price on Sundays was $23,595. On Saturdays, it was $23,480. The highest average was on Wednesdays: $23,850.\n\nIf an investor reaped the entire benefit of these figures, it would mean buying their BTC 1% cheaper each week.\n\nNot bad, Bard."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoiners rejoiced this week when KPMG, one of the \u201cbig four\u201d worldwide accounting firms, published a report that underscored how the protocol can contribute in a positive manner to the three pillars of the ESG investing framework: environmental, social, and governance.\n\nKPMG\u2019s research is pivotal, says CH4 Capital co-founder and renowned ESG analyst, Daniel Batten.\n\n\u201cNo matter what your view on ESG, demonstrating how Bitcoin makes positive contributions [to environment, social and governance initiatives] is critical to both mainstream and institutional comfort,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Batten, the KPMG report\u2014titled \u201cBitcoin\u2019s role in the ESG Imperative\u201d\u2014is an \u201cimportant moment, because it represents for the first time a mainstream financial institution having gone through a thorough due diligence process on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe report documents a deep dive in the framework\u2019s three pillars, beginning with the environmental aspect of Bitcoin mining\u2013the energy intensive and controversial process through which new BTC is created. KPMG says the mining industry \u201cis focused on driving towards Net Zero emissions.\u201d\n\nKPMG showcases how Bitcoin emissions compare to other key worldwide industries (such as tourism and fashion), elucidating it is a mere fraction. The publication outlines several strategies towards reducing the network's carbon footprint, including using renewable energy, and recycled heat among others.\n\nBatten, an expert on ESG matters, explained to Decrypt that he is surprised by the thoroughness of the report. \u201cIt's usual for reports to let certain folklore slip through the due diligence process such as \u2018but Bitcoin takes renewable energy away from other users,\u2019\u201d he said, praising the KPMG team for the quality of their research and publishing what he considers to be \u201cnon-obvious truths.\u201d\n\nThe social aspect of the report touches upon the hotly debated \u201cBitcoin is for criminals,\u201d narrative, pointing to a recent Chainalysis report. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly asserted that cryptocurrency is a favored tool of criminals, fueling societal ills like the fentanyl epidemic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKPMG countered these claims with the opportunities the protocol presents for financial inclusion, such as crowdfunding Ukraine\u2019s efforts in its war with Russia, providing access to electricity in Africa, and the role it plays for minorities around the world.\n\nLast but not least, KPMG addresses the governance aspect of Bitcoin, and the decentralized aspect of the network specifically, which it writes is one of its \u201cmost prominent features.\u201d The report acknowledges that the network\u2019s rules cannot be changed or modified by those in power, pointing to a \u201crobust\u201d governance structure that provides a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d in the overall system.\n\nThe report concludes that Bitcoin provides a number of positive benefits under an ESG investing framework, and ends with a series of questions for ecosystem players\u2013prompting users, miners and other organizations to assess their relationship to the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI think it's an important report and a milestone the ecosystem should celebrate,\u201d Batten tells Decrypt. He remarked that \u201cIt's important people read reports put out by Bitcoin opponents,\u201d although Batten reckons \u201cthere is still much work to be done, with several mainstream news channels continuing to publish misinformation about Bitcoin with impunity.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, however, that \u201cthis will improve education and help the intellectually curious person to form an informed viewpoint on the utility of Bitcoin.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Power Players: Highlights From The Mining Disrupt Conference - ETF Trends",
        "content": "This annual event attracts the who\u2019s who of the digital asset mining industry, including top players, enthusiastic investors and Bitcoin advocates alike.\n\nI just returned from an invigorating week in hot and humid Miami, Florida, where I was privileged to present at the Mining Disrupt conference. This annual event attracts the who\u2019s who of the digital asset mining industry, including top players, enthusiastic investors and Bitcoin advocates alike.\n\nIn my capacity as Executive Chairman of HIVE Digital Technologies, I was excited to shed light on our company\u2019s involvement in the great digital transformation and expansion into the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and Web3 applications. You can read about HIVE\u2019s long-term plans here.\n\nUndeterred Optimism Amid The Ongoing Bitcoin Bear Market\n\nMy fellow presenters and attendees were all incredibly bullish on Bitcoin, despite the ongoing bear market that has seen the digital asset retreat from its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nThe conference coincided with Bitcoin crossing a significant milestone: the successful mining of the 800,000th block. This landmark event teases the upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving event, projected to happen when block 840,000 is mined in less than nine months from now. The halving process, which occurs approximately every four years, cuts the rewards for Bitcoin miners in half, thereby limiting new supply and creating scarcity.\n\nHistorically, every new cycle has resulted in a fresh, record-high price for Bitcoin. This phenomenon is attributed to the realization among investors that the asset\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a factor that could spur the price to visit new highs.\n\nBitcoin In Need Of Regulatory Clarity\n\nMany presenters and panelists at the conference centered their message on the need for regulatory clarity in the mining space. Among the most esteemed speakers was Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, whose mission is to educate legislators and policymakers across the U.S. on Bitcoin\u2019s varied benefits.\n\nDuring his presentation, Dennis drew interesting parallels between Bitcoin and the cannabis industry, both of which have had to lobby for state-level acceptance and legislation, even as they continue to face federal-level restrictions. He touted his group\u2019s success in getting Montana and Arkansas to pass the Right to Mine law, which protects Bitcoin miners and prohibits energy producers from imposing discriminatory rates on them. The Fund was also instrumental in moving the Texas legislature to kill a proposed anti-mining bill.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also participated at Mining Disrupt via Zoom, representing one of four current candidates who expressly support Bitcoin-friendly policies, the others being entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida governor Ron DeSantis and Miami mayor Francis Suarez, who opts to take his mayoral salary in Bitcoin.\n\nKennedy, who recently disclosed purchasing two bitcoins for each of his seven children, reaffirmed his intention to back the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin and exempt the asset from capital gains taxes if elected president, saying that such exemptions should primarily benefit small investors and businesses.\n\nA Legislative Milestone For Digital Assets?\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, a bipartisan bill that aims to provide a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies was advanced by a key congressional committee last week. This legislation, endorsed by the House Financial Services Committee, was in response to last year\u2019s sudden collapses of several crypto firms, including Celsius and Voyager. It defines a cryptocurrency\u2019s status as either a security or a commodity, expands the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) oversight of the industry and clarifies the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) jurisdiction.\n\nDespite some opposition, the bill received support from committee Republicans and some Democrats, marking a major legislative moment for the digital asset sector.\n\nMake no mistake, the bill has been met with opposition, primarily from Rep. Maxine Waters, the leading Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, who believes the bill would cause confusion and reduce protections for consumers and investors. Similar concerns have been raised in the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nHowever, many in the crypto industry remain optimistic, asserting that with bipartisan support, the bill could stand a chance in the Senate. The debate continues over whether these assets should be treated as securities or commodities, highlighting the need for regulatory clarity in this evolving sector.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs And Their Potential Approval\n\nI also want to highlight the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved in the U.S. At the Mining Disrupt conference, there was guarded optimism that this may happen soon, following repeated rejections in the past. I believe a spot ETF would be a significant catalyst for Bitcoin, potentially streamlining access for both institutional and retail investors and driving up demand and price.\n\nApplications for such an ETF from multiple firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, VanEck and WisdomTree, have been published in the Federal Register, moving them one step further in the SEC\u2019s approval process. The official journal of the U.S. government now has a window to accept, reject, extend or open these applications for public comments.\n\nWith the Bitcoin network inching closer to the next halving event and the simultaneous evolution of the ecosystem and regulatory landscape, the world is keeping a watchful eye on the digital asset\u2019s progress. Here\u2019s to the fascinating journey ahead!\n\nOriginally published by U.S. Global Investors on July 31, 2023.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit VettaFi | ETF Trends.\n\nFrank Holmes has been appointed non-executive chairman of the Board of Directors of HIVE Digital Technologies.

If it goes to zero you lose $1, who cares!\n\n\"But if I'm right I want all of you to thank me, it will not make me happy if you come back to me in 10 years saying 'dude, I wish I listened to you back 2011 or 2013'.\"\n\nAt the time, the price of one Bitcoin per $1 was $116.75 (\u00a391.60) - but at its peak in 2021, its worth ballooned to a whopping $61,000 (\u00a348,000).\n\nDespite the highs and lows that come with investing, it has steadied itself out for now and currently holds a value of $30,000 (\u00a323,500).\n\nDavinci has certainly done well out of it, as a quick scroll through his Instagram offers a peek into his lavish lifestyle funded by Bitcoin.\n\nThe tycoon holidays in the likes of Dubai and Monte Carlo, relaxes on superyachts and parties with the rich and famous.\n\nHe previously shared a post showing him posing with three bikini-clad women on a flash cruiser off the Mexican coast.\n\n\"A yacht filled with women, you know I am down,\" Davinci wrote. \"This was just a taste.\"\n\nWhether his road to wealth was a stroke of luck or genius remains debatable - but the millionaire is certainly smug about it.\n\nDavinci recently told CoinTelegraph: \"Once in a while, something comes along that makes poor people rich because they got it really, really cheap.\n\n\"This was one of them. I thought I was gonna be the hero to my community, but no, they thought I was crazy.\n\n\"They actually thought I was losing my mind.\"\n\nAs a reminder of the self-confidence that kicked off his journey to success, Davinci now wears a huge Bitcoin ring on his middle finger.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"Family Man, Programmer, YouTuber, and early Bitcoin adopter\" in his Twitter bio.\n\nDavinci is still a huge fan of cryptocurrency despite conquering the sector and now mentors aspiring investors to achieve their goals.\n\n5 Davinci boasts a net worth of at least $10million thanks to his risk-taking Credit: Instagram/@davincij15\n\n5 The Bitcoin-obsessed tycoon has ridden the crypto wave for over ten years Credit: Instagram/@davincij15"

        "title": "Decoding Bitcoin halving: An in-depth look at the halving process and its impact - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Rajagopal Menon\n\nIn the realm of digital assets, Bitcoin stands out as a revolutionary innovation. Conceived as a store of value and a means of value transfer, Bitcoin has fundamentally transformed our understanding of what a digital asset can be. Prior to the invention of Bitcoin, digital files could only be replicated and never actually transferred. The concept of transferring ownership of a digital asset in a way that unambiguously assures that the original possessor no longer owns it was a complex problem that Bitcoin ingeniously solved. This solution lies in the immutable ledger of the blockchain, where each transaction is recorded in a transparent manner, allowing anyone to witness the debit and credit. One of the most intriguing parts of Bitcoin is the idea of \u2018Bitcoin halving.\u2019 For the first time in technology history, we have a digital asset that is designed to be rare, a feature that has far-reaching consequences for the future of digital currencies.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Limited Supply: A Key Feature\n\nA distinguishing characteristic of Bitcoin is its limited supply. Unlike traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will, Bitcoin has a predetermined maximum supply of 21 million coins. To ensure the digital currency\u2019s scarcity and value, its creators made a deliberate design decision to limit its supply.\n\nBitcoin Halving: A Mechanism Ensuring Scarcity\n\nBitcoin\u2019s scarcity is maintained through a process known as Bitcoin halving. Approximately every four years, the number of new Bitcoins created through mining is cut in half. This reduction in the rate of new coin creation ensures that the supply grows at a decreasing pace, ultimately leading to a fixed maximum supply.\n\nThe Significance of Bitcoin Halving Events\n\nBitcoin halving is a significant event in the Bitcoin network that occurs once every 210,000 blocks. It is a process aimed at reducing the reward given to miners for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. This reduction is done by 50% every halving event, thereby reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. This means that the block reward will halve or decrease by half, which will give miners 3.125 of newly minted Bitcoin per validated block. Since a new block of transactions is completed roughly every 10 minutes, this works out to an average Bitcoin halving event every four years. The next halving will happen around April\u2013May 2024.\n\nThe limited supply of Bitcoin has had a profound impact on its value. As the demand for Bitcoins increases and the supply remains restricted, the scarcity factor amplifies its perceived value. This scarcity-driven value proposition has made Bitcoin a highly sought-after digital asset. Historically, in the months immediately following a halving event, Bitcoin pricing didn\u2019t show much movement. It usually started heating up around 12 to 18 months after a halving. However, it\u2019s not quite clear that the spikes in prices 12 to 18 months after the halving events actually correlate exclusively with the halving. Other forces could cause Bitcoin to spike or drop before or after the halving as well.\n\nImplications of Bitcoin Halving on the Ecosystem\n\nBitcoin halving events have profound implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. As the block reward decreases, miners are incentivized to compete more aggressively for the remaining reward. This can lead to increased mining difficulty and a higher level of network security. Additionally, halving events often trigger a surge in the price of Bitcoin, as the reduced supply creates a sense of scarcity and increased demand.\n\nThe impact of halving events extends beyond the immediate effects on miners and the price of Bitcoin. The reduction in block rewards also affects the economics of mining, as miners need to carefully manage their operational costs and revenue streams. Some miners may choose to exit the market altogether if the reduced rewards make mining unprofitable, while others may seek out more efficient mining hardware and strategies to maintain profitability.\n\nIncrease in consolidation in the industry also leads to establishment of mining groups resulting in their advantage over individual miners who cannot keep up with the operational costs. Also access to energy sources with minimal negative impact on the environment is a scarcity unless a big mining corporation manages to get their hands on it.\n\nSo while Bitcoin mining has its own benefits, some of the industry\u2019s older stakeholders might drop out as they cannot keep up with the demands.\n\nBitcoin Halving: A Recurring Event Shaping the Future\n\nBitcoin halving is a recurring event that plays a critical role in the Bitcoin network. It reduces the block reward received by miners, controls the rate of new Bitcoin creation, and influences various aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The history of halving events showcases the evolution of Bitcoin and its growing significance in the financial world. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, future halving events are expected to generate even more interest and shape the future of Bitcoin.\n\nThe author is vice-president, WazirX\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has maintained its value below the $30,000 mark, with the asset failing to break past the key resistance level amid extended consolidation across the general market. However, Bitcoin\u2019s technical analysis suggests that the asset might be on the road to another all-time high based on historical price movements.\n\nIn particular, pseudonymous crypto trading analyst TradingShot, in a post on TradingView on August 4, observed that the maiden cryptocurrency has just completed the third-ever golden cross pattern, a bullish price signal in the long term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to the analysis, the previous two instances of the pattern led to significant price rallies for Bitcoin. Once the cross occurred, the 200-day moving averages calculated on a three-day time frame (3D MA 200) turned into a crucial support level, helping sustain the uptrend.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the exceptional circumstances of the March 2020 coronavirus crash, which he equated to a Black Swan, caused a temporary disruption in the typical pattern.\n\nDrawing parallels to previous cycles, the analyst emphasized that with the 3D MA50 guiding the price action, the next likely target for Bitcoin\u2019s upward movement would be its all-time high, which was last at $69,000.\n\nAdditionally, he attributed the relatively faster attainment of the 2019 golden cross to the \u201cLibra euphoria\u201d and other positive fundamentals that contributed to the increased adoption of Bitcoin. Conversely, in 2020, reaching the all-time high took a little longer, taking around 100 days more than the previous cycle.\n\n\u201cIt could be a fair estimate that Bitcoin would have reached the current ATH ($69,000) by around this time next year,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat next for Bitcoin after hitting a golden cross?\n\nThe golden cross pattern occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. In the case of Bitcoin\u2019s recent golden cross, the price was trading above the 3D MA50 and 3D MA200, indicating a positive trend shift for the digital asset.\n\nIn general, Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced volatility recently, and the impact of the golden cross is seen as a sign of optimism in the asset\u2019s price trajectory. Notably, there is a consensus regarding the possibility of Bitcoin rallying to new highs.\n\nAs reported by Finbold, a significant number of Bitcoin holders (69.2%) have no intention of selling their assets but prefer \u2018Hodling.\u2019 At the same time, the amount of Bitcoin sent to exchanges has also dropped in recent weeks.\n\nIt is anticipated that the next Bitcoin halving, slated for 2024, could trigger the commencement of a new market cycle. In the short term, Bitcoin faces threats of declining further below the $29,000 mark. A Finbold report indicated that machine learning algorithms project the asset is likely to trade at $28,000 at the end of August.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $29,014 with minor gains of less than 0.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nElsewhere, under technical analysis, as retrieved from TradingView, indicators suggest bearishness. A summary of the one-day gauges recommends a sell signal and rates 10, similar to moving averages at 9, while oscillators are neutral at 9.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the meantime, with prevailing volatility, the market is keen on how Bitcoin will react in the short term.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
