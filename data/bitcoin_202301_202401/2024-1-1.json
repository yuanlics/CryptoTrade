        "content": "The world's largest cryptocurrency hit an intraday high of $45,913.30 early Tuesday morning, according to Coin Metrics. That was its highest level since April 5, 2022, and the first time it has traded above the $45,000 mark since then. It was last higher by nearly 3%, trading at $44,952.89.\n\nBitcoin surged to start 2024, topping $45,000 for the first time since April 2022 amid an uptick in geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea and growing optimism around a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval.\n\nThe increase showed bitcoin's role as a hedge against uncertainty, which investors became familiar with last year. Over the weekend, a Maersk vessel came under attack by four small boats crewed by Houthi militants, who are based in Yemen and backed by Iran.\n\nMost of the six-month rally in bitcoin is tied to the potential ETF, but before that narrative came into play, bitcoin's biggest catalyst was the regional banking crisis in the U.S. That led to bitcoin's first big gain of the year, allowing the cryptocurrency to shine as an alternative to the legacy system in place and hedge against uncertainty.\n\nThe move also comes amid continued excitement among traders that the U.S. could approve the first bitcoin ETF. This would allow investors to buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin without having to own the cryptocurrency directly, likely appealing to larger institutional investors.\n\nOn Friday, BlackRock and other potential issuers updated the registration forms for their proposed bitcoin ETFs, including names of authorized participants. Investors are reading that extra detail as evidence that a decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is coming soon. Many industry experts expect the funds to be approved in January.\n\nThe continued price gains for bitcoin follow 2023's hot streak, when the price of the digital coin rose 157% \u2014 and many expect the pop to continue.\n\nInvestors have high hopes for bitcoin in 2024. A decision on an ETF is widely expected to come sometime in January. Shortly after, in the spring, the Bitcoin halving is expected to take place, an event that historically has preceded steep price increases. Plus, Fed officials are anticipating at least three interest rate cuts this year after almost two years of hikes that have hurt the cryptocurrency.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies also ticked higher Tuesday. Ether traded at around $2,367, up roughly 1%.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin soared to nearly $46,000 on Tuesday morning, representing a 7% gain on the day and the cryptocurrency\u2019s highest level since April 2022. The latest uptick comes after Bitcoin had remained stuck in a band close to $43,000 for most of the prior two weeks following a series of gains in the last quarter that appear to signal a new bull market for the crypto industry after a disastrous 2022.\n\nBitcoin finished the year up 154%, making it one of the best performing assets of the year, while other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Solana likewise posted big annual gains.\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin, which gave up some of its gains midday Tuesday to trade closer to $45,000, appears tied to widespread anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve bids by BlackRock, Fidelity, and others to launch Bitcoin ETFs in the next two weeks.\n\nThe launch of Bitcoin ETFs is expected to attract new pools of capital into the crypto markets from institutions and other conservative investors who are restricted from buying Bitcoin directly, but may be willing to do so in the form of ETFs, which package assets in the form of shares traded on mainstream exchanges.\n\nIn addition to firms from the traditional financial sector, including Franklin Templeton, a number of pure crypto firms like Bitwise are vying to launch Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC had long refused to approve such applications, but the agency appears set to reverse course after a unanimous federal appeals court concluded its earlier refusals were unreasonable.\n\nThe recent price gains for Bitcoin have led some to speculate that the ETF approvals will prove to be a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event, and that the price will sag once the products are finally approved. Others have taken a more bullish case, predicting the price of Bitcoin has plenty of room to climb.\n\nAs with previous crypto bull markets, other cryptocurrencies\u2014including so-called altcoins\u2014have ridden Bitcoin\u2019s coattails to achieve gains of their own. The biggest gainer has been Solana, a rival smart contract platform to Ethereum that had been pummeled for its association with the fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried but has since won back confidence from the market. Solana began 2023 around $16 and is now trading near $108, making it the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Bitcoin is up over 150% in 2023, and that momentum has captured hearts and minds on Wall Street, resulting in a landmark rush for its firms to launch the first-ever Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nAll eyes are now on the upcoming decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, slated for January 10.\n\nIf the past is any indication, the ruling will have a significant impact on Bitcoin's price, though whether positive or negative remains to be seen.\n\nPotential for a Price Rise\n\nProponents of a Bitcoin ETF argue that its approval by the SEC would open the door to a flood of institutional and retail investments, driving the price of Bitcoin to new heights.\n\nHistory offers a glimpse into how expectations surrounding ETFs have affected Bitcoin's price.\n\nIn 2017, the price of Bitcoin surged to over $1,400, driven in part by the anticipation of the first Bitcoin ETF. This was up from lows in the $600 range just the year before.\n\nInvestors believed then that the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF would make it easier for institutional money to enter the market, leading to a frenzy of buying. However, the SEC ultimately rejected the proposal, causing a sharp decline in Bitcoin's price.\n\nWithin days, the price was trading back below $1,000.\n\nUltimately, however, the arrival of Bitcoin futures would bring new attention in 2017, the market surging above $20,000 that year.\n\nPrice increase from CME Bitcoin futures announcement to listing.\n\nElsewhere, we can fast forward to 2021, when Bitcoin once again rallied to all-time highs, reaching over $60,000.\n\nThis time, the rally was partly fueled by the successful launch of Bitcoin futures ETFs in Canada and Europe. These ETFs allowed investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the cryptocurrency directly. The anticipation of a similar product in the U.S. contributed to the bullish sentiment.\n\nFinally, in the wake of fake news of an ETF approval earlier this year, Bitcoin's price rose by several thousand dollars in minutes, a move that suggests upside volatility on approval is likely.\n\nThe Bitcoin price spikes on fake news of an ETF approval.\n\nPotential for a Price Fall\n\nOn the flip side, there are arguments suggesting that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could lead to a price correction.\n\nSome market experts fear that the ETF could become a target for short sellers, leading to increased volatility, or that the ETF could be a \"sell the news event.\"\n\nMoreover, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may bring greater regulatory scrutiny to the cryptocurrency market as a whole. This heightened oversight could lead to increased taxation, reporting requirements, and potential restrictions on the use of Bitcoin, which may dampen enthusiasm among investors.\n\nAdditionally, some believe the market may already have priced in the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF approval, and any decision to deny it might lead to disappointment and a sell-off similar to what was witnessed in 2017 when the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF was rejected.\n\nBitcoin price sell-off after the ETF rejection in 2017.\n\nThe final decision by the SEC is eagerly awaited by the crypto community, but it's essential to remember that it is just one of many factors influencing Bitcoin's price.\n\nMarket sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and geopolitical events will also play their part in shaping the coin's future.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin's price is at a crossroads as investors await the SEC's decision on the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile past instances have shown that ETF expectations can have a substantial impact on Bitcoin's price, it is crucial to consider the broader market dynamics. Whether Bitcoin's price rises or falls after the SEC ruling will depend on a multitude of factors, including how the market interprets and reacts to the decision.\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain, but it's undeniably a pivotal moment for the world's only decentralized cryptocurrency.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Will a Bitcoin ETF Make Crypto Go Mainstream? - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a decade since the idea of bringing bitcoin to the masses was but a twinkle in the Winklevoss twins\u2019 eyes. Bitcoin, of course, is much easier to buy than it was when Barack Obama was president, but the fees, delays, and existential risks of crypto exchanges have led most of the investing public, including nearly all institutional investors, to remain on the sidelines. To date, there arguably hasn\u2019t been an easy, cheap, low-risk way for regular folks with a 401(k) or a brokerage account to buy into the digital currency. But the widely expected approval by regulators of numerous bitcoin-exchange-traded funds in the coming days could change all that.\n\nETFs, as they\u2019re generally known, are a $7.7 trillion industry, making them one of the world\u2019s most popular ways to invest. A (usually) cheaper and easier evolution of the mutual fund, they\u2019ve been around for 30 years and are deeply ingrained in the way investors around the world now make, and lose, money on Wall Street. At the heart of it, these funds are just ways to buy and sell more complex investments in exactly the same way you might buy and sell a single company\u2019s stock. If you want to buy gold or a given category of bonds or even just stick it to Jim Cramer, you can buy or sell an ETF to do it. To date, the most notable exception to that rule has been bitcoin \u2014 with the Securities and Exchange Commission having rejected many applications over the years, starting with the Winklevii\u2019s in 2013. (There are a few bitcoin-related ETFs currently approved, but they are based on derivatives rather than actual bitcoin.)\n\nNow, voices ranging from laser-eyed bitcoin evangelists to Wall Street analysts are predicting that various versions of a bitcoin ETF will be available by January 10. The frenzy over the change has been enormous. The digital currency \u2014 abandoned by all but the most fanatical early last year \u2014 has been streaking to new recent highs and rose past $45,000 during the holidays, more than tripling its post-FTX low. In 2024, which is, as of this writing, not yet two days old, it has risen as much as 8 percent.\n\nBREAKING: Bitcoin is now trading above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022.\n\n\n\nThis puts #Bitcoin up 175% over the last year and 210% above its November 2022 low.\n\n\n\nA Reuters report this weekend said SEC Bitcoin ETF approvals could be coming as soon as this week.\n\n\n\nSince SEC\u2026 pic.twitter.com/u9hvRkNMbY \u2014 The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 2, 2024\n\nThe hype comes down to this: An ETF makes investing in bitcoin easy and relatively more safe. People trust ETFs because they\u2019re simple to buy and sell nearly instantly \u2014 decidedly not the case when it comes to most digital currencies \u2014 and fully regulated. The ease and peace of mind could (in theory) lead to a flood of money that will push the price of bitcoin even higher over the coming weeks, months, and years.\n\nThe companies getting involved here are, in many cases, household names (and not just for people who have their own pet theories about what happened to Satoshi Nakamoto). Industry giants BlackRock and Fidelity are among those positioned to make the first offerings, which could trade on exchanges like NASDAQ. Expectations around the new ETFs have led to a boom not just of bitcoin\u2019s price but also boosted other digital currencies, including ones that were all but left for dead after their close association with convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about little people getting hurt in this stuff, you would want these big, reputable firms to be involved. We\u2019ve always said the ETF is SBF-proof,\u201d said Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence who has been monitoring the creation of the crypto fund. He predicts there\u2019s a 90 percent chance that the ETF will be approved by government regulators in January. (An online prediction site pegs the odds at roughly the same.)\n\nSo what happened? If you take a look at the details of the Winklevoss twins\u2019 very first proposal for a bitcoin ETF and the ones that are being proposed today by BlackRock and other big firms, they are \u201cnot really\u201d all that different, Balchunas said. What changed was a big loss in court in August when a judge ruled that the SEC was arbitrarily preventing another massive crypto player, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, from offering its ETF in the U.S. (It\u2019s currently available in Europe and other markets.) The SEC, which is led by chairman Gary Gensler, has been a bogeyman for the crypto industry in large part because of the roadblocks it has set up against the creation of these kinds of funds. For a long time, the regulators said they were concerned about market manipulation \u2014 and about investors losing money. But after the start of the pandemic, when digital currencies of all stripes caught on in a big way with at least some sectors of the public \u2014 and with the agency green-lighting ETFs tied to bitcoin-futures contracts \u2014 the argument became less and less tenable.\n\nThere also has been a real change in the mood around crypto over the past few months, following a string of legal actions and prosecutions by the U.S. government. In the fall, Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO, was found guilty. Then his counterpart at Binance, Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty to money-laundering violations and stepped down from the company. Su Zhu, the founder of Three Arrows Capital, crypto\u2019s biggest hedge-fund flameout, got arrested; Do Kwon, the guy whose spectacular collapse presaged all the other reckonings, is on the verge of getting extradited to New York to face federal charges for financial crimes.\n\nIn the wake of the cleanup effort, and with growing interest from financial giants like BlackRock, it now appears that bitcoin is on the verge of going corporate \u2014 and fast. Balchunas pointed out that you could even see the changing market psychology in play in the way that some of these proposed ETFs are named. While fund manager VanEck uses the crypto slang term HODL as the ticker for its fund, BlackRock is using the much more sober-sounding IBIT. \u201cWhen it comes to, like, the 75-year-old boomer or a wealth manager, bitcoin is crazy enough. The ticker should almost offset a little bit of the volatility,\u201d he said.\n\nGrayscale, the company whose lawsuit was at the center of the SEC\u2019s legal about-face, is also moving quickly for approval. On the day after Christmas, the company announced that its chairman, Barry Silbert, would be stepping down. (He is a named defendant in a fraud suit from the New York attorney general\u2019s office, and there are multiple investigations into the company from New York and federal regulators over its lending business with the Winklevoss twins\u2019 exchange.) On January 2, the company filed an updated, though incomplete disclosure that included some technical changes that regulators are said to expect from these firms.\n\nThat the new bitcoin ETFs are probably almost here was confirmed in late December, as public filings have made it clear that the SEC is getting very involved. James Seyffart, also an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said:\n\nSo far we know there were at least 7 separate meetings/calls between SEC and potential #bitcoin ETF issuers yesterday. Total meetings at 32. Notably @BitwiseInvest, @InvescoUS, & @hashdex aren't showing official meetings (Yet?). Maybe SEC is okay with their current S-1 documents? pic.twitter.com/HoUI27RMqU \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 22, 2023\n\nSpeaking as someone who\u2019s neither a regulator nor a financier, that sure seems like a lot of meetings in a short period of time for something that wasn\u2019t going to happen. There have also been technical changes to the way people will be able to invest in the ETFs, which appear to be one of the final hurdles. \u201cBased on information that\u2019s come in in the last 24 hours, it looks like they\u2019ve given informal approval,\u201d Balchunas said.\n\nEven Cramer \u2014 usual caveats apply \u2014 seems convinced that this is happening:\n\nJUST IN: Jim Cramer says you can't kill #Bitcoin and it's here to stay. pic.twitter.com/wYKrDqsfQm \u2014 Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) January 2, 2024\n\nFor the bitcoin set, the timing of an approval could be a giant boon. Wall Street has all but placed its bets that the Federal Reserve will avoid a recession with the first cuts to interest rates expected around March, market data shows. The everything rally that has been going on for the past few weeks could certainly creep into crypto ETFs. Balchunas expects there will be about $55 billion to $60 billion invested in these ETFs by the end of the next two or three years. This is far from a guarantee that people wouldn\u2019t lose money \u2014 the digital currency is notoriously volatile, and it\u2019s unlikely that new funds would change that about it. But for people who just want to gamble a little bit, why not? \u201cIt is a bridge between the crypto underworld and the traditional finance world \u2014 and the baby-boomers of America who have a lot of money,\u201d Balchunas said."

        "content": "As the Securities and Exchange Commission appears on the precipice of approving the first wave of Bitcoin ETFs, issuers are jockeying for an early advantage to attract investors.\n\nIn late December, two of the major issuers\u2014Fidelity and Galaxy/Invesco\u2014released details on their fees, while a slew of issuers named authorized participants, setting the stage for a battle to gain crucial early-mover status.\n\nThe crypto industry has long looked at a spot Bitcoin ETF as a surefire vehicle to bring traditional investors, from retail traders to asset managers, into the volatile sector.\n\nSince the Winklevoss twins first filed for approval in 2013, the SEC has rejected applications, citing the immature Bitcoin market and the potential for manipulation. After the crypto asset manager Grayscale won a critical court case against the agency in 2023, however, the SEC has signaled its intention to open the floodgates to the investment vehicle, which tracks the current price of Bitcoin.\n\nThere are currently 12 issuers vying for spot Bitcoin ETF approval, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. In late December, Reuters reported that the SEC asked issuers to file their last revisions to their applications by the end of the year ahead of a launch date that could come as soon as Jan. 10\u2014the deadline for the SEC to approve or reject the first issuer in line, ARK/21Shares.\n\nNew details\n\nAs issuers file updates to their applications, the details of how the ETFs will function has come into focus. For weeks, the predominant question has focused on the model of redemption that issuers will follow. ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, function with the help of institutional investors called authorized participants who can create or redeem individual shares in the fund as part of an arbitrage system that keeps the price of the ETF shares close to the value of the underlying asset. While most ETFs hold traditional stocks or bonds, which are simple for authorized participants to buy and sell, a Bitcoin ETF presents a more challenging model.\n\nRather than having authorized participants buy or receive Bitcoin directly from the issuer\u2014the \u201cin-kind\u201d model\u2014the SEC pushed issuers to follow a cash model, which would put the onus of Bitcoin buying and selling on the issuer, reflecting the agency\u2019s reluctance to allow broker-dealers to handle Bitcoin.\n\nIn updated filings from Dec. 29, Fidelity, Galaxy/Invesco, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, and BlackRock all listed the first authorized participants that they will work with. Fidelity and WisdomTree both named Jane Street Capital, a secretive trading firm that previously employed FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. BlackRock and Galaxy/Invesco, a partnership between the crypto firm run by Mike Novogratz and the traditional investment management company, both named JPMorgan and Virtu, a market-making firm. Valkyrie named Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nMore critically, two of the issuers released details on the fees that they will charge investors for the ETF\u2014a key element that could determine the most popular options in a crowded field. Invesco/Galaxy announced that it would waive fees for its first six months of operation and for the first $5 billion in assets held, followed by a 0.59% fee. Fidelity announced its fee would be 0.39%. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, predicted on X that BlackRock would set its fee at 0.47%.\n\nAs the crypto industry waits for the SEC\u2019s final decision, the price of Bitcoin is rallying on an expectation of approval, soaring to nearly $46,000 on Tuesday morning\u2014its highest price since April 2022."

        "content": "Bitcoin popped to start the new year as eager investors drove the price to nearly $46,000 on Tuesday. The rally began late Monday night and quickly pushed the cryptocurrency above $45,000. It hit a high of $45,913.30, a level not seen since April 2022. While bitcoin ended 2023 with a brief pause in its overall uptrend, it still posted its fourth positive month in a row and a 157% gain for the year. The next stop on the way to a new all-time high is between $48,000 and $50,000, chart analysts told CNBC. \"Bitcoin is breaking away from a three-week consolidation pattern which usually causes an acceleration in the direction of the break, i.e. higher,\" said Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com. That means bitcoin shouldn't spend too long at its new level, he added. BTC.CM= 1D mountain Bitcoin rallying to start 2024 Wolfe Research's Rob Ginsberg said the reacceleration following the recent consolidation is \"very encouraging action\" and that he \"would expect an overbought signal and consolidation to develop\" between $48,000 and $50,000. De Kempenaer said bitcoin should hold $45,000 for the next day or two for the breakout to be confirmed and for the price to become bitcoin's new support level. Even with small pullbacks in sight, investors have high hopes for bitcoin in 2024. In the first half of the year, a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund is expected to be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bitcoin halving that typically precedes strong gains in the price will take place just a couple months later. Some on Wall Street have expressed concern that the market reaction should an ETF get greenlit may not live up to the hype that has driven the crypto market for the past six months, and that the market could correct all the way down to $32,000. Nevertheless, traders broadly remain optimistic on the long-term view of the asset class. But first, bitcoin has to reach $48,000, de Kempenaer said. Bitcoin hasn't traded above $48,000 in about two years, according to Coin Metrics."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, and Riot Platforms Popped to Start 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The stock market has been off since Dec. 29, but the crypto market has been open, leaving four days of catch-up for equity investors. So, a relatively modest move of 3.6% over the last 24 hours for Bitcoin (BTC -6.30%) has driven a double-digit increase in crypto-related stocks.\n\nIf we go back to the market close on Friday, Bitcoin's value is up 7.3% after a big increase in value on Monday. MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%) responded by jumping as much as 15.2% in early trading Tuesday, and Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.82%) was up 10.6%. The two stocks are up 9.6% and 0.8%, respectively, at 3:00 p.m. ET.\n\nBitcoin drives the market\n\nThere was a crypto rally to start 2024, and gains were widespread across the market. But the biggest tokens have seen the most gains as there's a flight to quality in both crypto and the stock market. That's why Bitcoin and Ethereum are up over the last few days, while Solana, Binance, and XRP are about flat.\n\nWhen Bitcoin rises, it greatly impacts some leveraged Bitcoin plays. MicroStrategy is one of the most impacted, with 158,400 Bitcoin on its balance sheet as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, levered by $2.2 billion of debt.\n\nRiot Platforms produced 552 Bitcoin in November 2023 and sold 540 Bitcoin. However, the company held 7,358 Bitcoin on the balance sheet, so any increase in value for Bitcoin will make the company's balance sheet more valuable.\n\nIn the base of both MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms, today's price increase is catching up from four days of the market being closed and Bitcoin rising in value.\n\nWhere does Bitcoin go from here?\n\nIt's important to understand the opportunity and risk for the companies we invest in, and for Bitcoin-related companies, there can be some strange impacts. While investors can get direct exposure to Bitcoin by simply buying Bitcoin through a centralized exchange or a crypto wallet, companies like MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms offer even more exposure by holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet.\n\nMicroStrategy levers returns by adding debt, and as a miner, Riot Platforms has operating exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nThere continue to be rumors that a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is imminent, but we haven't seen that come to pass. I'm not sure the market's reaction would be positive if an ETF were approved in the U.S. There's often a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" reaction from the market, and Bitcoin has been rising for three months in hopes that an ETF is near.\n\nIf an ETF is approved, I wouldn't be surprised to see values fall.\n\nOutside of an ETF, Bitcoin has traded hand in hand with growth stocks in the past three years, and that will likely be the case in 2024 as well. If the stock market -- specifically growth stocks -- does well, it would likely be positive for Bitcoin, but a correction could be bad news as investors seek out safety.\n\nBitcoin hasn't been a safe haven in a falling stock market. So, investors must be aware of the risks and rewards for top cryptocurrencies in 2024."

Both stocks fell slightly after midday but remained up on the previous close.\n\nShares of Coinbase (COIN), the largest U.S.-domiciled crypto exchange and the preferred asset custodian of most prospective ETF providers, were more than 8% lower as of Tuesday afternoon.

This marks the first time the cryptocurrency has stood above this benchmark since April 2022.\n\nYahoo Finance Crypto Reporter David Hollerith examines bitcoin's performance on the first trading day of 2024 and the investor optimism on pending Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJARED BLIKRE: That's right, Seana, 46,000. Let's go to the Y-Fi Interactive because you're going to see a notable difference from the screen just as it was a few minutes ago. And there. There's all that green. And you put it over the last three days because we are in the midst of a multi-day rally, you can really see some of the outperformers here.\n\nFor what it's worth HEX's up 84% over this time, Solana up 10.8%, even Shiba Inu up 10%. And you take a look at some of the crypto stocks here, let me go to a market cap view. So the bigger ones that have Bitcoin exposure pretty much down here, but here's MSTR strategy, that's up about 4.2%. And we'll get a two-day chart there, you can see quite a big pop on the open.\n\nI was looking at some of the pre-market movers here, and this is over the last three days. If you take a look at the last-- at only one day, a lot of these losses that we were seeing over that period have been clawed back here. Let me just go back to Bitcoin and chart the price action over the last year because this latest breakout is par for the course.\n\nWe have seen just a series of higher lows and higher highs here. We've seen a number of consolidations, a lot of flags here, and they have all resolved to the upside. So this is the definition. This is a textbook stair stepping trend higher, not only over the short term, but over the long term as this has been in place for several months now.\n\nI want to show you Bitcoin seasonality. I was able to generate this. And Bitcoin, this goes all the way back to 2011, so it's basically the average of the returns every day of the year. And when I say that, it's every day of the year it trades. So that makes it a little bit easier.\n\nBut you can see it's a really choppy here. We tend to take a little bit of a tumble in May, June, early summer, then find our footing in July with another upswing in October. We'll have to see how it plays out this year, but seasonality worked so well last year with stocks, so worth paying attention to."

        "title": "Watch Bitcoin ETF Fully Priced In: Glen Goodman - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nHow much is already in the price? How much further do you think this rally could go? Well, your guy James there is on record saying he thinks that there's about a 90% chance of approval, at least of some of the ETFs. And quite frankly, it's not just him. It's well, I mean, he's he's he's done really well. He's come up with a lot of the intelligence on this whole thing. But pretty much everyone is bought into this idea that the ETF is a coming. So, yeah, I mean, when it comes to it being priced in, I'd say it's pretty fully priced in probably. And when you look actually at the futures funding rates on various crypto exchanges like Binance and so on, you see that those there are quite frothy levels. A lot of people are borrowing a lot of money in order to buy Bitcoin. So if it did start falling, you could get that kind of domino effect where accounts start getting liquidated because people have overstretched themselves on the old on the old leverage. So this is what worries me is that it feels like a bit of a lose lose situation as it if you do get ETF approval, then perhaps a little of that is already priced in and in. If you don't get ETF approval, then who knows? Yeah. Do you have a sense of how far bitcoin could drop if you don't get that approval? It's worth talking about because it's been like it's been a foregone conclusion by the market standards. But Gary Gensler has not been shy about cracking down on this industry. Absolutely. That's the one factor I think that people are forgetting here, because we're hearing so many positive signs, like Cathie Wood, who you had on just the other day talking about how they've been sort of, you know, sort of behind closed doors discussions over the holiday period between S.E.C. officials and, you know, asking all kinds of technical questions, which makes it sound like they're about to dot the I's and cross the T's. But Gary Gensler, we know he just he never has anything to say about it, though, does he? So he is the unknown factor in all this. And frankly, he is the boss. So if he suddenly decides, no, it's not good enough, we need more things done. We need, for example, like the guy from Bitgo recently said, maybe they will insist on separating custody and exchanges in a very, very deliberate way. You know, something like that. That could be all kinds of factors that could just delay this. And if we get the impression from them that the delay is open ended as opposed to just, oh, we just want a few final things done, then it could be really bad. And you ask me how far the Bitcoin price could fall. I mean, we know from past experience when the Bitcoin price falls, sometimes it really falls in ways that stock markets very, very rarely do. You know, absolutely terrifying falls that could wipe out, as I said, a awful lot of banks could wipe out, you know, even months of gains. So what I've done, I'll tell you what I'm doing is I'm lighting up a bit. You know, I've been long for quite a while now following this trend all the way. I'm lightning. I'm not selling all my stuff because quite frankly, this is just a theory. And maybe the price will continue rising as more and more people get excited about the ETF approval, assuming it is approved. But, you know, just to be on the safe side, I'm kind of thinking the risk reward is not looking so great at this level. So that's why I've lightened up my holdings. Well, Glenn, it's interesting because what you're saying runs counter to what many people are telling us on this program who are very excited about what a spot ETF ultimately could mean. Obviously, when we talk about crypto, most of these tokens don't trade on anything fundamental. They maybe latch on to one narrative like, say, a spot ETF getting approved. So in the absence of that, what other catalysts do you see for 2024 that could be supportive or not to prices across the board? Well, I should just make the point I'm talking short term timescale here, but that talk about lightning up is because as we know, you know, Bitcoin could fall like 25% or something and barely break a sweat, you know, and then it could go all the way back up and further. That's the kind of thing Bitcoin does. And because I'd rather not lose 25% or whatever, that's what I'm lining up. But for the long term Bitcoin ETF approval is fantastic news. You've talked about it loads on Bloomberg, so I won't bore you too much with that. But but you know, you get the idea. It's a fantastic story for the longer term. Now other drivers for this coming year, gaming is pretty significant. A.I. is pretty significant. Decentralized social media is still one to look out for, I think, because it feels like the social media space is still trying to find its feet again after the whole kind of Twitter. You know, lots of people hating Elon Musk, setting up threads and blue sky and all these other platforms, It feels like this could still be space for a really major, decentralized, sort of decentralized social media platform. So that's something exciting. There are a lot for narrative that are good looking ahead, but frankly, the ETF approval is the best narrative of."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 price will hinge on regulatory environments, public perception, and institutional adoption.\n\nRegulatory changes will crucially impact Bitcoin\u2019s stability and growth prospects in 2024.\n\nIncreased corporate and institutional engagement is expected to significantly boost Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nGlobal economic factors, including inflation and market shifts, will closely influence Bitcoin\u2019s valuation.\n\nSince its inception, Bitcoin has been subject to notable price swings, capturing the interest of individual traders, significant investors, and the public alike. The price of Bitcoin can rise significantly, driven by increased adoption, limited supply, and growing institutional interest.\n\nFactors That Affect The Price Of Bitcoin\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin volatility and discovery requires insight into several critical aspects that impact Bitcoin price movement. Key factors that contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility include:\n\nBitcoin Regulatory Environment\n\nGovernment stances significantly affect Bitcoin\u2019s path. Positive and clear regulations can enhance investor trust and lead to growth, while strict rules or prohibitions can cause instability.\n\nPublic Perception Of Crypto\n\nHow Bitcoin is viewed by the public, influenced by media, influential figures, and overall market behavior, can significantly affect its value.\n\nCorporate And Institutional Engagement\n\nAs more prominent businesses and financial entities adopt and utilize cryptocurrency, it lends greater legitimacy and potentially boosts its value.\n\nGlobal Economic Factors\n\nWorldwide economic conditions, including inflation, recessions, and stock market shifts, often parallel impact Bitcoin\u2019s valuation.\n\nSupply-Demand Dynamics\n\nLike any traded asset, Bitcoin\u2019s value is influenced by supply and demand. The halving events diminish the available supply and could push prices up, especially if demand remains consistent.\n\nWhat Will Bitcoin Be Worth In 2024? Experts\u2019 Insights\n\nSeveral experts in the field, both individual and institutional, are bullish on the price of Bitcoin moving into the year 2024. These forecasts can be seen below:\n\nCathie Wood | CEO Ark Invest | $600K\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Invest predicts Bitcoin could reach $650,000 in 2024 to $1.5 million by 2030, with her optimism spawning from a potential spot Bitcoin ETF and Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, contrasting with centralized entities like FTX.\n\nThis prediction entails a crypto market cap representing over half of a projected $25 trillion total crypto market, emphasizing Bitcoin\u2019s role as a unique global digital monetary system.\n\nMike Novogratz | CEO Galaxy Digital | $500K\n\nMike Novogratz, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Galaxy Digital, has significantly revised his earlier bullish predictions for Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2021, he had anticipated Bitcoin reaching $500,000 by 2024, even planning a commemorative tattoo for the milestone. Novogratz maintains a long-term optimistic view, believing Bitcoin will eventually hit $500,000, though not within the next five years.\n\nHis current outlook is influenced by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s firm stance on interest rates, which Novogratz has forecasted as a barrier to a rapid return to Bitcoin\u2019s previous highs.\n\nTim Draper | Billionaire Investor | $250K\n\nBillionaire investor Tim Draper, known for his early advocacy of cryptocurrency, has adjusted his prediction for Bitcoin\u2019s value. Initially, Draper forecasted that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by June 2023.\n\nHowever, he recently acknowledged that this target might be delayed until 2025, attributing the postponement to unexpected aggressive enforcement actions by the U.S. government, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), against crypto companies.\n\nDraper remains optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s value and underlying technology, envisioning a future where financial transactions and operations are conducted entirely in Bitcoin, leveraging blockchain\u2019s transparency and efficiency.\n\nMax Keiser | American Broadcaster | $220K\n\nMax Keiser, a seasoned financial broadcaster and Bitcoin advocate, has long been known for his outspoken and sometimes controversial predictions.\n\nKeiser\u2019s unique insights into Bitcoin\u2019s price movements and broader global economic implications provide a thought-provoking perspective. Max advocated for Bitcoin when it was just $1 and has been one of the earliest adopters and most influential figures in the space.\n\nFundstrat | Research Firm | $180K\n\nFundstrat, a prominent research firm, has set an ambitious target for Bitcoin, predicting it could soar to $180,000 by its 2024 halving.\n\nThis forecast is based on two major factors being: the potential launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the historical influence of previous halving events on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nFundstrat\u2019s projection reflects a bullish stance on Bitcoin\u2019s future, buoyed by these significant market developments and anticipated changes in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nStandard Chartered | Investment Bank | $120K\n\nStandard Chartered has revised its Bitcoin price forecast, now estimating it will hit $50,000 by the close of 2023 and then escalate to $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nThis projection represents an upward revision from the bank\u2019s earlier forecast, which anticipated Bitcoin reaching a value of $100,000 by the conclusion of 2024, showcasing an increasingly optimistic view of Bitcoin\u2019s market potential in the next few years.\n\nRobert Koyosaki | Author Investor | $120K\n\nNumerous well-known individuals have forecasted that Bitcoin will eventually reach $100,000.\n\nAmong them is Robert Kiyosaki, the American investor and author of \u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad,\u201d who predicts a potential surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $120,000 by 2024, driven by a decline in the U.S. dollar.\n\nAdam Back | Computer Scientist | $100K\n\nAdam Back, renowned as a pioneering figure in the Bitcoin community, projects that the cryptocurrency will hit the $100,000 mark by March 31, 2024.\n\nHis prediction considers the pivotal role of Bitcoin miners and the anticipated impact of the upcoming halving event. According to Back, this event, set to reduce the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions, could propel its value close to $100K, setting the stage for a significant milestone in Bitcoin\u2019s valuation journey.\n\nJesse Myers | OnRamp Capital | $100K\n\nJesse Myers of OnRamp Capital believes that Bitcoin will surpass the $100,000 mark only after the 2024 block subsidy halving.\n\nHe anticipates that it will take the market between a year to 18 months to fully adjust to the effects of the halving. This perspective suggests a more gradual increase in Bitcoin\u2019s value, following the pattern set by the significant event in the cryptocurrency\u2019s ecosystem, which alters the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated.\n\nArthur Hayes | CEO BitMEx | $70K\n\nBitMEX\u2019s founder, Arthur Hayes, envisions Bitcoin potentially reaching $70,000 by 2024 amid a more conservative short-term outlook.\n\nHe predicts a significant surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value, with a long-term projection of $750,000 to $1 million by 2026. In his recent interview , Hayes pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply, the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs in regulated markets, and geopolitical uncertainties as significant factors driving this anticipated growth.\n\nHe underscored the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s capped supply at 21 million coins, which he believes will fuel demand. Additionally, Hayes anticipates a bullish trend across all asset markets, influenced by central bank policies.\n\nWhile his predictions for the near future are modest, with Bitcoin possibly hovering around $38,000 this year, his long-term forecast is notably optimistic.\n\nBerenberg | Investment Bank | $56.6K\n\nThe investment bank Berenberg has updated its forecast for Bitcoin, setting a target of $56,630 for April 2024. This revised prediction is shaped by the anticipated 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to impact the supply dynamics significantly and increase interest from institutional investors.\n\nConsidering these key market developments, Berenberg\u2019s projection reflects a cautious yet optimistic outlook on Bitcoin\u2019s future.\n\nJP Morgan | Investment Bank | $45K\n\nJP Morgan analysts predict Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $45,000 in 2024, a slight premium to its current trading price. Bitcoin trades at $38,000 (at the time of writing), approximately 20% below JP Morgan\u2019s forecast.\n\nThis bullish outlook is partly based on the belief that investors see Bitcoin as interchangeable with gold and also considers the impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for next April or May. This represents a notable change in the narrative around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe price of Bitcoin in 2024 is expected to be influenced by regulatory policies, public perception, institutional adoption, global economic conditions, and supply-demand dynamics.\n\nExpert predictions vary, with estimates ranging from $45,000 to $600,000. These projections reflect optimism about Bitcoin\u2019s future amid challenges in a dynamic market, highlighting its potential growth and continued relevance in the financial landscape.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat factors will influence Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2024?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 2024 price will be shaped by regulatory environments, public perception, corporate engagement, global economics, and supply-demand dynamics.\n\nHow will regulatory changes impact Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nGovernment regulations will significantly affect Bitcoin\u2019s stability and growth in 2024, with clear policies potentially boosting investor trust.\n\nWhat Role will institutional adoption play in Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 valuation?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value in 2024 could rise with increased corporate and institutional engagement, lending legitimacy and boosting its value.\n\nHow might global economic factors affect Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nWorldwide economic conditions, including inflation and market shifts, will likely parallel Bitcoin\u2019s valuation in 2024."

But Cramer says Munger missed the boat on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe late Charlie Munger, who was so brilliant on so many things, was blind to this,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCramer's comments come as the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed $45,000 on January 1 for the first time since April 2022. It was in June of that year that Cramer noted a growing pessimism about crypto in Silicon Valley after the last market dump, which he dubbed \u201cCrypto Monday.\u201d\n\n\"A lot of younger people and people who borrowed money, they are going to be gone today if they are not careful,\u201d Cramer said at the time.\n\nCramer's track record of dubious calls has been the source of multiple eye rolls from the crypto faithful, even inspiring an Inverse Cramer meme and applications for an Inverse Cramer ETF. The hook? Doing the opposite of everything Cramer says. And now that he's warming to Bitcoin, some crypto faithful are worried.\n\n\u201cShit, now Bitcoin is dead,\u201d prominent Bitcoiner Dan Held wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cDoes that mean BTC is doomed?\u201d Director of Operations at Nillion, Amro Shihadah, said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCramer\u2019s tone began to change in November after Bitcoin crossed $38,000, which also led some to speculate a subsequent drop because of the notion that the opposite of anything Cramer predicts will happen.\n\nDespite his previous comments, Cramer called Bitcoin a technological marvel today, and noted the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's inability to shut it down.\n\n\u201cIt's a reality and it's a technological marvel,\u201d Cramer added. \u201cI think people have to start recognizing that it's here to stay; the SEC has been against it the whole time.\u201d\n\nEven though Cramer may be changing his tune on Bitcoin, he did note that enthusiasm does not translate to the crypto market as a whole.\n\n\u201cNow, that doesn't mean that every one of these is here to stay,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cBut I do think that it's about this, a remarkable comeback, that was unexpected.

        "content": "Daily Email Feature Market Awaits Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nAsset managers updated their fillings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for approval to launch spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds at the end of 2023\n\nBlackRock VanEck, Valkyrie Investments, Invesco, Fidelity and WisdomTree Investments were amongst the group of fund managers that had updated their SEC filings for spot bitcoin ETFs by 29 December 2023. Reuter reported that the US regulator may approve issuers on 2 or 3 January 2024.\n\nThe SEC has only permitted bitcoin futures ETFs, and has so far rejected all the applications for spot bitcoin ETFs. However, in July this year five bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck and WisdomTree were published in the Federal Register, which sets a timeline for the SEC to review the proposals.\n\nEric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, highlighted that the updated filings included details of authorised participants (APs) and fees. Authorised participants have an agreement with the ETF issuer that it can manage the creation and redemption of ETF shares in the primary market so that the ETF accurately tracks the value of its underlying index.\n\nFor example, Balchunas noted that BlackRock was the first to name APs for its proposed bitcoin ETFs on 29 December \u2013 Jane Street Capital and JP Morgan Securities. Subsequently, WisdomTree and Fidelity both named Jane Street as an AP and Valkyrie Digital Assets also named Jane Street as an AP, alongside Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nJust to be clear: the AP names weren't due in S-1s, so BlackRock adding them in there is a bit of a flex in that regard. So if we see other S-1s not naming AP doesn't mean they don't have one lined up. But this does make BlackRock the first horse officially ready imo. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 29, 2023\n\nFidelity's S-1 in as wow, it included its fee which will be 0.39%, by far lowest so far, also names Jane Street as AP. Fidelity is officially ready to party. pic.twitter.com/Taq32IGB0L \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 29, 2023\n\nBalchunas found that Invesco named Virtu and JPMorgan as APs and the fund manager waiving fees for first six months and for first $5bn in assets:\n\nInvesco/Galaxy is in and here's a whopper: it will be waiving fee for first six months AND for first $5b in assets, APs named as well, Virtu and JPMorgan (again lol). Another horse in. Are we having fun yet? pic.twitter.com/mDUOOSnA29 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 29, 2023\n\nAll or almost all of these filers have their AP's lined up and they know what their fees are going to be (at least roughly). These N/A's will have to be filled in before launch and before SEC signs off on the S-1's but are not needed for 19b-4 approvals as far as i'm aware \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 2, 2024\n\nData provider CCData said in a report in December that the pending approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF contributed to the performance of bitcoin in 2023.\n\nBitcoin rose 156% in 2023 which CCData said was more than traditional financial benchmarks such as Nasdaq, S&P500, and Gold, and will remain a catalyst this year. The approval of BlackRock\u2019s ETF could propel Bitcoin\u2019s price to \u201cnew, extraordinary heights\u201d according to CCData.\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF application sent waves through the market, as the world\u2019s largest asset manager signalled keen interest in the digital asset industry,\u201d said the report. \u201cInstitutionally, we have observed key signs of positive sentiment following the rebirth of the industry post-FTX, with participation by sophisticated players rising at a consistent pace.\u201d\n\nCCData highlighted the performance of gold following the launch of the first SPDR ETF and said bitcoin may be entering a new period of accessibility and adoption.\n\nBlockworks Research said in a daily newsletter that 2024 is starting with bitcoin pumping at over $45k, a new local high\n\n\u201cThe CME BTC Futures are trading at a ~2.5% premium to spot, showing that TradFi is certainly getting ahead of the announcement,\u201d added Blockworks. \u201cBTC miners are also rallying after a large sell-off across the board on 29 December.\u201d\n\nGrayscale Investments, the digital currency fund manager, said in a blog that if the SEC approves trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs, this may broaden the number of investors with regulated access to digital asset investment products, and potentially result in new net demand for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIn light of a relatively \u201ctight\u201d supply backdrop, as well as the halving of Bitcoin issuance scheduled for April 2024, new net inflows into the asset should have positive implications for Bitcoin\u2019s valuation, in our view,\u201d added Grayscale.\n\nIn August 2023 Grayscale won a lawsuit against the SEC, challenging the regulator\u2019s decision to deny conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\nMichael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale, said in a statement at the time that the win brought the market one step closer to making a US spot Bitcoin ETF a reality.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic milestone for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d added Sonnenshein. \u201cGrayscale has adhered to US financial rules and regulations in building our product suite since our founding in 2013, underpinned by one fundamental belief: investors deserve transparent, regulated access to crypto.\u201d"

        "content": "In a recent interview, the CEO of blockchain investment firm Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, announced that \u201cbig things are coming,\u201d according to Contribune. Mike is also an advocate for the launch of a Bitcoin ETF in the US. In a recent interview, the CEO of blockchain investment firm Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, announced that \u201cbig things are coming\" (Mike Novogratz/Facebook)\n\nEver since the first Bitcoin ETF was launched in Canada, American investors have sought that such an investment vehicle be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This will potentially make sure there is an index fund that mirrors the price of bitcoin. There would also be no need to directly buy the cryptocurrency. Companies like Fidelity, SkyBridge, and Valkyrie have lately filed applications, and Galaxy Digital, in partnership with Bloomberg, also happens to be a candidate.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nIt is unclear when a Bitcoin ETF may actually be approved. However, the Federal Reserve previously acknowledged that bitcoin could really become an important digital asset. Back in September 2022, the White House appreciated the technological innovation of digital assets. It also praised the way these assets may be potentially applied. The four existing Bitcoin ETFs in Canada reportedly totals over 1.5 billion dollars in assets.\n\nMike\u2019s statement, thus, appears to be a ray of hope.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nAccording to Corporate Finance Institute, \u201cBitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the value of Bitcoin and trade on traditional market exchanges rather than cryptocurrency exchanges. They allow investors to invest in Bitcoin without having to go through the hassle of using a cryptocurrency exchange while providing leverage to its price.\u201d\n\n\u201cnvesting in a Bitcoin ETF provides leverage to the price of Bitcoin without having to learn about how Bitcoin works, having to sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange, and taking on the risks of owning Bitcoin directly. For example, Bitcoins are held in a wallet, and if an investor loses the password to the wallet, their Bitcoin is lost forever. A Bitcoin ETF simplifies the process of investing in Bitcoin,\u201d it adds."

        "content": "After 2022 brought little but pain for bitcoin traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this past year has been one for the books \u2014 and optimism abounds for the year ahead.\n\nBitcoin, and cryptocurrencies more generally, performed quite well in 2023. Bitcoin was trading at just about $16,600 at the start of the year but charged to over $40,000 in December \u2014 offering those who bought in January massive 150% returns.\n\nSHADOW OF DOUBT: HOW 2020 ELECTION CHALLENGES IN ARIZONA AND GEORGIA ENDED\n\nThat is a big turnaround from 2022, when bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies faced major headwinds, culminating in the dramatic collapse of crypto giant FTX and the arrest of the company\u2019s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nOther digital assets also performed well in 2023. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has surged by more than 81%, cardano has risen by 110%, and ripple has increased some 80% in value. Even meme coins like dogecoin have posted gains, with the value of one such token rising nearly 32% since the start of the year.\n\nBitcoin has particularly risen in the past few weeks, in part due to optimism in the crypto world that a number of applications for bitcoin ETFs will be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The price of bitcoin rose nearly 50% in the past two months alone.\n\nMost in the crypto world think that at least some of the ETF applications will get approved. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts said in a recent note that they expect the SEC to approve all of the applications.\n\nAlso adding wind to bitcoin\u2019s sales is building anticipation that the Fed is done with its rate hikes and could begin cutting in the first half of next year.\n\nThere is also optimism for bitcoin heading into the new year because of something known as \u201chalving.\u201d The bitcoin halving is an event that will take place in a few months and could be good news for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies throughout 2024.\n\nThe way bitcoin was designed, about every four years, the block rewards for bitcoin miners get slashed in half, reducing the supply of new bitcoins by 50%. That makes the product a scarcer commodity and tends to raise the price in the following months.\n\nJames Lawrence of Siesta Markets told the Washington Examiner that the approximately 18 months after such a halving event has typically been a bull market for the flagship cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a continuation of bitcoin getting more and more scarce,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nPredictions for how bitcoin will fare in 2024 are all over the board, although Lawrence is optimistic. He said that he thinks the price of bitcoin could go as high as its previous record of about $69,000 by the end of this coming year.\n\n\u201cAnd I could see us flirting with $100,000 bitcoin going into next Christmas 2024, or January 2025 \u2014 like flirting with the six-figure range,\u201d he said."

Meanwhile, in the European Union, the member states are not allowed to launch their own cryptocurrency, but crypto exchanges are encouraged to be legalized and comply with the regulations.\n\nAs of 2024 the most Bitcoin-friendly countries where BTC is legal are:\n\nAntigua and Barbuda: A bill was passed to protect exchanges and crypto users.

        "content": "Moderna Stock Surges on Optimism of Bringing More Products to Market Moderna Inc. (MRNA) shares soared 15% Tuesday as the vaccine maker got two pieces of good news. First, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Stephane Bancel said he believes the company would experience sales growth in 2025. In a letter to shareholders Tuesday, Bancel said the company is optimistic as it expects the launch of Moderna\u2019s respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate this year and could potentially launch a combination flu/COVID-19 shot as early as 2025. Along with Bancel\u2019s comments, Moderna shares got a lift Tuesday when brokerage firm Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to \"outperform,\" arguing that Moderna could develop ways to use its mRNA technique to fight diseases beyond COVID-19 over the next few years. Analysts at Oppenheimer led by Hartaj Singh wrote they believe the company will have five new products on the market by 2026. Moderna shares tumbled about 40% last year, making it one of the S&P 500's worst-performing stocks. -Bill McColl\n\nApple Stock Tumbles Following Barclays Downgrade Shares of Apple (AAPL) sank 4% Tuesday, wiping more than $100 billion from its market capitalization after Barclays expressed doubts about the health of iPhone demand. Barclays analyst Tim Long downgraded the company\u2019s stock to \u201cunderweight\u201d and warned clients in a research note that iPhone 15 sales have been \u201clackluster.\u201d Long also cautioned that muted demand for Apple\u2019s best-selling product could impact sales of its next model, the iPhone 16, and other hardware categories like Macs, iPads, and wearables. Apple\u2019s hardware sales and total revenue have declined for four straight quarters, yet its stock steadily climbed over the same period. Apple\u2019s fast-growing services unit was one bright spot for the company last year, but Long expects growth to slow and regulatory scrutiny over the company\u2019s App Store and revenue-sharing agreements with Google (GOOGL) to intensify. Barclays\u2019 bearish outlook puts the firm squarely in the minority. Of the 44 analysts covering Apple tracked by the Wall Street Journal, 22 rate the stock a buy, and 5 are overweight\u2014one step below \u201cbuy\u201d in terms of conviction. Just 4 analysts have assigned the tech giant a rating of \u201cunderweight\u201d or \u201csell.\u201d\n\nMidday Movers: Moderna Rises After an Upgrade, While Apple Falls Following Downgrade Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other semiconductor firms fell after the Dutch government curbed exports of some chipmaking equipment by ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) to China. Apple (AAPL) shares also slumped after Barclays downgraded the stock and cut the price target, pointing to concerns about iPhone demand and the company\u2019s overall hardware sales. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) and rival cruise lines dropped as naval military action in the Middle East region raised worries about sea travel. Moderna (MRNA) shares soared as CEO Stephane Bancel indicated the vaccine maker expects sales to grow in 2025, and as Oppenheimer analysts upgraded the stock, saying its mRNA technique used in COVID-19 vaccines could be used to fight other diseases over the next few years. An upgrade and price target increase from Wells Fargo sent Centene (CNC) shares higher. Tapestry (TPR) shares increased when JP Morgan raised the price target, arguing earnings growth for the owner of Coach and Kate Spade brands will accelerate. -Bill McColl\n\n\n\nASML Falls After The Netherlands Curbs Exports of Some Tech to China American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) dropped over 3% in intraday trading Tuesday as Dutch officials blocked the semiconductor production equipment maker from exporting some of its products to China. The company said a license for shipment of its NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i lithography systems in 2023 \u201chas been partially revoked by the Dutch government, impacting a small number of customers in China.\" The move came as the U.S. has also ramped up restrictions on certain tech exports to China over concerns about national security. ASML said it doesn\u2019t believe that the decision by Amsterdam or the latest American export controls will impact its 2023 financial outlook. Despite Tuesday's decline, ASML Holding N.V. ADRs have gained more than 30% over the past year. -Bill McColl\n\nTesla Spared Big Tech Sell-Off After Meeting 2023 Delivery Goals Shares of Tesla (TSLA) were little changed Tuesday morning, bucking the trend among its Magnificent Seven peers, after the electric vehicle leader said it had met its 2023 production and delivery goals. The company produced 495,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, bringing its 2023 total to nearly 1.85 million, a 35% increase over 2022. It delivered about 485,000 last quarter for a total of 1.81 million in 2023. Both figures were slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates and the guidance Tesla issued in October. Still, America's largest EV maker trails its main competitor on the global stage, China's BYD Co. (BYDDY), which delivered more than 3 million fully electric and hybrid vehicles last year.\n\nBitcoin Surges to 21-Month High The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed Tuesday to its highest since April 2021 as anticipation of a spot exchange-traded fund built. Investors are increasingly convinced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week will approve at least one of the many spot Bitcoin ETF applications it is currently considering. The regulator kicked the can down the road last year but it now faces a Jan. 10 deadline to either approve or deny Ark Invest's ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. Many analysts expect that the SEC will decide on several ETFs simultaneously to avoid giving one provider a head start. Financial giants BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco are among the asset managers whose ETF applications could be approved. Federal regulators have long bristled at the idea of an ETF backed by Bitcoin, citing its susceptibility to fraud and market manipulation. But the odds of approval increased significantly last year when a court ruled that the SEC needed more reason than it had provided for denying asset manager Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nOne company that\u2019s likely to win regardless of which applications are approved is Coinbase (COIN), which has been named the asset custodian in the majority of the ETF applications before the SEC.\n\nStocks Making the Biggest Moves Premarket Gains: Coinbase Global (COIN): Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange gained about 3% as the price of Bitcoin shot up above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022.\n\nFrontline Plc (FRO): Shares of the oil shipper gained 2%, following oil prices higher after Iran sent a warship to the Red Sea, ratcheting up tensions in the key shipping corridor.\n\nLosses: ASML Holdings N.V. (ASML): Shares of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker fell 4% after the Dutch government ordered it to halt some shipments to China.\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL): Shares of the tech giant fell 2% after Barclays downgraded the stock to \u201cunderweight,\u201d citing weak demand for the iPhone 15.\n\nBaidu Inc. (BIDU): Shares of the Chinese tech firm fell about 2% after it called off its $3.6 billion acquisition of social media company JOYY\u2019s live-streaming unit, YY Live. JOYY (YY) shares fell nearly 10% in early trading."

        "title": "What Gen Z Thinks About Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "One of us is from Kentucky and the other from China. We both attend Washington and Lee University in Virginia. Last summer, we assisted Professor Seth Cantey, also a co-author of this piece, with research on the roles of bitcoin and Tether in Lebanon. To help with that work, first we had to learn a lot. What is bitcoin, and what are the problems it\u2019s trying to solve? How is it being used in Lebanon? Could bitcoin adoption mitigate the economic crisis? For two months, we wrestled with these questions.\n\nBut another question came up too. What does our generation, Gen Z, think of bitcoin?\n\nGen Z, the demographic cohort succeeding Millennials, includes those born from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s. Basically, we\u2019re digital natives in our teens and twenties. We\u2019re already entering adulthood, taking up an increasing share of the workforce, and contributing to the global economy. We\u2019re not Blackrock, but whether and how we adopt bitcoin will matter for the currency and the network in the long term. So, we decided to ask our peers what they thought about the technology. And we have some thoughts of our own.\n\nOur survey was simple, not scientific, but we found it anecdotally useful. We asked two open-ended questions to dozens of peers in the United States and China: 1) What is your understanding of bitcoin? 2) How often do you come across it? We were especially interested in whether answers to these questions varied by geography, since the US and China have radically different policies vis-\u00e0-vis bitcoin and cryptocurrency generally.\n\nResponses from our peers were similar in some ways, different in others. Gen Zers in both countries view bitcoin mainly as an investment option. In the US, they tend to see it as a speculative investment, but one that\u2019s attracting increasing attention and gradually becoming a more prominent part of investor strategies. They also think savvy investors wouldn\u2019t allocate a large percentage of their portfolios to bitcoin. It\u2019s understood as \u201chigh-risk, high-reward.\u201d Chinese Gen Zers similarly regard bitcoin as a speculative investment, but they tend to be even more cautious. In China, bitcoin brings to mind gambling, cheating, and crime, all activities with potentially serious consequences. The Chinese government has made clear to its citizens that bitcoin is not backed by the state, creating the perception of a lack of guaranteed value.\n\nWhen asked whether and how they\u2019ve noticed bitcoin in everyday life, American Gen Zers characterize bitcoin\u2019s presence as peripheral. They\u2019ve seen bitcoin ATMs at gas stations, Coinstar machines while buying groceries, and payment options at certain online stores. Even QR codes at a few restaurants. In other words, they know bitcoin is out there, but it still feels like a novelty. In contrast, Chinese rarely see bitcoin in their daily lives. China\u2019s decision to ban bitcoin mining in 2021 contributed to the population\u2019s sense that it\u2019s mostly off limits. And while there has never been an explicit ban on holding bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in China, trading is illegal, and Beijing has warned banks and other financial institutions against providing crypto services.\n\nWhile our peers don\u2019t qualify as a representative sample of Gen Z, their views make sense to us, because they resemble what our own thinking was before working on this topic over the summer.\n\nBut that thinking has changed. After months of learning about bitcoin, we now recognize it as much more than an investment option. In Lebanon, where the banking and financial systems have collapsed, bitcoin serves as a savings tool and a hedge against inflation. In Russia, it\u2019s become a lifeline for dissidents whose bank accounts have been frozen. In Nigeria, it\u2019s a remittance vehicle with the potential to put companies like Western Union out of business. Refugees fleeing Ukraine have used it to transport wealth on hardware wallets or in their heads. El Salvador has made it the centerpiece of a campaign to attract high tech entrepreneurs and tourism. The list goes on.\n\nMore broadly, bitcoin looks like a way to level the playing field in the realm of international currency. We doubt it will ever replace fiat entirely, because governments will always want the ability to control money. It does seem plausible that bitcoin could serve as a check on fiat currencies, though, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the kinds of inflation we\u2019ve seen in recent years. If bitcoin were to do that alone, it would be a meaningful contribution to the world. But it\u2019s doing much more.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned from our peers is that bitcoin is misunderstood not just by boomers but across generations. We\u2019re still early. Having grown up with the internet, we think Gen Z is likely to catch on to bitcoin more quickly than others, but we\u2019re not there yet. So far, it\u2019s not being widely taught in universities, and our peers continue to think of it mostly as speculation. We think that will change in the years to come. Once people go down the bitcoin rabbit hole, we\u2019ve discovered, they tend to like what they see.\n\nThis is a guest post by Seth Cantey, Jack Evans, and Anonymous.

        "content": "Deadline Passes for Last Spot Bitcoin ETF Amendments\n\nAs the deadline for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve or deny the novel spot bitcoin ETF approaches, prospective issuers are filing final amendments to their regulatory filings after multiple editing rounds.\n\nThe agency told issuers, based on confidential sources, that Friday, Dec. 29 was the last day to amend their spot bitcoin S-1 applications for ETFs, according to Reuters. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark, Grayscale, and others filed amendments Friday, with Fidelity and WisdomTree naming Jane Street as the fund\u2019s broker dealer and Invesco naming JPMorgan and Virtu as their authorized participants.\n\nIssuers that filed new ETF amendments Dec. 29 will likely be included in the first round of launches, which could carry huge first-mover advantages for the novel product.\n\nWhile various issuers have vied to roll out a spot bitcoin ETF for a decade, the SEC only recently began to seriously work with firms to advance filings toward approval. This began after Grayscale won a watershed lawsuit against the SEC in late August, with a U.S. appeals court ruling that the regulator was wrong to block the company\u2019s conversion of their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.\n\nThis left the SEC\u2019s hands tied and opened the door for the debut of ETFs that track physically backed bitcoin.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nAs crypto specialist issuers such as Bitwise Asset Management and powerful Wall Street players including BlackRock work to woo crypto investors, an unprecedented ETF marketing war has kicked off.\n\nBitwise broke out of the gate first, releasing their \u201cMost Interesting Man\u201d spinoff commercial earlier this month. Hashdex and VanEck have also both released TV ads.\n\n\u201cIt's a marketing game from there, although some people would call it a war,\u201d Cathie Wood, who tops ARK, told etf.com in November.\n\nFees will also inform the competition. Invesco said in their filing that they will waive the fund\u2019s fee for the first six months and $5 billion in assets. Fidelity currently has listed the lowest fee, 0.39%, yet not all issuers have included fees in their filings.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin squeaked briefly above $45,000 on New Year's Day, a view it hasn't enjoyed since April 2022, and echoing the rollercoaster of January that year, when the price of the world's leading cryptocurrency oscillated above the threshold three times within a matter of days, interleaved with dips as low as $36,000.\n\nBitcoin was last at $45,000 on April 5, 2022, and sunk as low as $15,742 on November 9, according to Coingecko. Its New Year's Day market cap exceeded $836 billion, seeing trading volumes of $22 billion.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC is up over 171% compared to this time last year, rising more than 13 perccent over the past month, and up over 5% for the day. Bitcoin kicked off 2023 at under $17,000 per coin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis year, it's the drawn-out anticipation of the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the SEC that appears to be driving much of the upward movement. But many deadlines have come and gone with no formal action on any number of pending applications to offer a spot ETF. Could 2024 finally be the year it happens? And will the price of Bitcoin jump or plummet?\n\nBig round numbers like $45,000 don't have any special significance except that they represent psychological barriers for investors. Reaching one tends to increase confidence, which spurs more trading, and could then create a flywheel effect\u2014at least, that's what Bitcoin holders are hoping.\n\nIn the big picture, that means Bitcoin is edging closer to surpassing the high it saw last year when it started the year just shy of $50,000. BTC stayed mostly above $40,000 for a few months, but fell off a cliff after algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed and set off a wave of liquidations and bankruptcies.\n\nAs the world's largest and oldest cryptocurrency continues its rally, its total value by market capitalization continues to balloon. Bitcoin at $855 billion surpassed Elon Musk's Tesla in terms of market cap a while ago, after leaping past the $750 billion mark, according to CompaniesMarketCap. It's now also flipped Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which commands a $774 billion market cap, and Meta Platforms (formerly known as Facebook), which stands at $815 billion.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

After weeks of consolidation, the asset kicked off the new year with a blistering run past the $45k price resistance, trading at this level for the first time since April 2022. Following this rally, several analysts suggest that the asset still has enough in its tank to run even higher in the short term.\n\nAnalysts Weigh In on Bitcoin\u2019s Short-Term Direction Post $45k\n\nWith Bitcoin above $45k, several analysts have set their sights on higher prices, with only a few entertaining the idea of a price correction.\n\nIn an X post on Tuesday, January 2, Prominent crypto analyst \u201cDuo Nine\u201d contended that Bitcoin\u2019s break above $45k is a major breakout. The analyst tipped the asset to continue to $48k in the near term, with medium and long-term targets at $58k and $69k, respectively.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BREAKING NEWS \ud83d\udea8#Bitcoin starts 2024 with a higher high! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nThis is a major breakout.

In a tweet on the same day, MN Trading founder Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe appeared to agree with Duo Nine.

At the time, the financial services firm asserted that Bitcoin would likely reach the $50k mark in January 2024. The firm\u2019s research arm, 10x Research, recently reiterated this call in an email to subscribers.\n\nThe flurry of bullish predictions comes as analysts expect Bitcoin to continue to move higher in 2024, in line with previous bull market cycles.\n\nWill History Repeat Itself?\n\nAs has been highlighted by prominent crypto trader \u201cRekt Capital\u201d in recent weeks, Bitcoin\u2019s price action has historically formed four-year cycles. Per this model, following a yearly red candle representing a bear market, the asset typically follows up with three green yearly candles as the price bottoms out, enters a bull market, and peaks.\n\nThe #BTC Bottoming Out Candle 3 year is coming to an end, according to Four Year Cycle principles\n\n\n\nBut a new Confirmed Trend Reversal Candle 4 is set to form next\n\n\n\nSo what should we pay attention to in 2024?\n\n\n\nA thread\u2026$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/xgrNYS3ZEb \u2014 Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) December 22, 2023\n\nIn line with this trend, many expect Bitcoin\u2019s bull market phase to enter full swing in 2024 and peak in 2025. This optimism is further bolstered by the prospects of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the next few days and the halving in the coming months.\n\nDespite believing Bitcoin could experience a significant short-term correction, prominent analyst IncomeSharks has also noted that the asset could run up to a new all-time high in Q1 if ETFs are approved and see significant interest.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nContrary to recent bullish sentiments, IncomeSharks believes Bitcoin risks a short-term correction to below $36k before approaching new highs.\n\nAli Martinez recently highlighted that historically, Bitcoin has had a bearish January following a strong performance in September, October, November, and December of the previous year.\n\nSeveral experts have called for cautious optimism around the short-term price impacts of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval on the asset\u2019s price.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe crypto markets tend to follow Bitcoin\u2019s direction.

        "title": "What Led to Bitcoin Bull Runs in 2023? - CoinGape",
        "content": "A bull market, in the traditional market sense, refers to a phase of significant and sustained upward movement in the market. This period is characterized by positive market sentiment, which helps maintain the rise in prices. Additionally, increased participation from investors typically leads to a surge in trading volumes during a bullish phase.\n\nAlthough various parameters can indicate a bull run in the crypto market, Bitcoin often serves as a reliable barometer. This is due to Bitcoin\u2019s dominant market position and high levels of trading activity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn this post, we explore key moments in 2023 when significant increases in Bitcoin\u2019s price suggested the onset of a bull market.\n\nH1 2023: The Rise and Resilience\n\nIn January, according to TradingView charts, Bitcoin started the year at a low of around 12,000 USDT. This was the lowest level seen since November 2020. By January 20, the king coin had soared above 23,000 USDT, marking a significant rise in the first half of 2023. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) exceeded 70, indicating an overvalued or overbought market from January 10 to January 29.\n\nThe surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price at the start of 2023 can be attributed to several macroeconomic factors. High inflation and the US Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive monetary policies set the tone for the year. Additionally, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine exacerbated an energy crisis, leading to increased prices for natural gas and oil. This period also saw the US report its highest inflation levels in approximately four decades. Moreover, January witnessed the successful launch of Bitcoin Ordinals, which positively impacted the market and likely contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s price increase.\n\nIn February, Bitcoin\u2019s price spiked to around 25,000 USDT, at a time when the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive interest rate hikes hit the market. Due to high inflation, the trend shaped the first half of 2023. March saw Bitcoin surpass the crucial resistance level of 28,000 USDT. Around March 17, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin briefly remained above 70, indicating an overvalued market. The uptrend continued until April 14, with market volatility starting to decrease after the first week of April. This period marked a significant phase of price movements influenced by macroeconomic factors and monetary policies.\n\nIn April, Bitcoin\u2019s price breached the 30,000 USDT mark, coinciding with Ethereum\u2019s significant Shapella hard fork. By June, Bitcoin had reached levels above 31,000 USDT.\n\nH2 2023: Bitcoin\u2019s Momentum Continues\n\nA major boost occurred in mid-July when a U.S. judge ruled Ripple Labs Inc.\u2019s XRP token sales on public exchanges did not violate federal securities law, leading to a market surge. August saw further positive developments as a federal judge overturned the SEC\u2019s decision to deny a Bitcoin ETF from Grayscale Investments. Finally, a substantial upsurge occurred around October, with Bitcoin hitting around the 35,000 USDT mark.\n\nOn October 19th, Bitcoin\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) exceeded 70, indicating an overvalued or overbought market, and it stayed within the normal or above normal range until December 11th. This period coincided with growing optimism for the potential launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF and a shift towards more relaxed monetary policies, factors that contributed to the positive market sentiment.\n\nIn early December, Bitcoin impressively surpassed the 44,000 USDT level, marking the highest price point of the year, despite experiencing some volatility. This volatility was evident in both November and December, as indicated by the widening of Bollinger Bands. The period was also significant due to the near-realization of the Bitcoin ETF launch, a development that not only bolstered the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. but also had a global impact, signaling a major step towards mainstream acceptance of crypto assets."

        "title": "Bitcoin surpasses $45,000 for 1st time in 2 yrs on ETF approval hope - Business Standard",
        "content": "By Suvashree Ghosh\n\nBitcoin surpassed $45,000 for the first time in nearly two years as anticipation of an approval of an exchange-traded fund investing directly in the biggest token intensified.\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency jumped as much as 4.3 per cent to its highest level since April 6, 2022 and traded at $45,355 as of 12:25 p.m. Singapore time. Other tokens also advanced with Ether, the second biggest, rising as much as 2.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin has risen over 20 per cent since the start of December as a Jan. 10 deadline for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to give its blessing for a spot ETF Bitcoin draws closer.\n\nThere\u2019s a fear of missing out among some traders in the US and Europe ahead of the looming approval and investors have started \u201cbuying on January 1, first thing New Year\u2019s morning,\u201d said Hayden Hughes, co-founder of social-trading platform Alpha Impact.\n\n\u2018Nerves of Steel\u2019\n\n\n\nOptions traders had been betting on Bitcoin hitting $50,000, riding on the spot ETF optimism.\n\nA major correction is unlikely given the broader bullish sentiment and the upcoming halving, said Cici Lu McCalman, founder of blockchain adviser Venn Link Partners, referring to a process that cuts the quantity of Bitcoin that miners receive per block reward in half. \u201cI think traders would need nerves of steel to short BTC,\u201d she said.\n\nThe halving \u2013 sometimes referred to as halvening \u2013 is planned for April and happens once every four years or so. The coin hit records after each of the last three halvings.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s near 160 per cent rebound last year partially repaired some of the damage caused by a precipitous 2022 crash that reverberated around the crypto industry. The token outperformed global stocks and gold over the period but remains below its 2021 pandemic-era record of almost $69,000.\n\nShares of so-called crypto companies also rallied ahead of normal trading hours in New York. Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy rose about 7.8%, miner Marathon Digital jumped 11% and crypto exchange Coinbase Global gained 4.1%."
