        "title": "At bitcoin convention, few feel chill of crypto winter - Marketplace",
        "content": "What organizers call the world\u2019s largest bitcoin convention took place in Miami Beach this month.\n\nFor $999 \u2014 in traditional U.S. currency \u2014 you could spend a couple of days with 12,000 fellow bitcoin enthusiasts doing all manner of bitcoin things: perusing the bitcoin art gallery, testing the latest and greatest bitcoin mining rigs and attending panels with topics ranging from \u201cDecentralizing Yourself\u201d to \u201cFighting the Anti-Crypto Army.\u201d\n\nThat 12,000 figure is less than half of last year\u2019s attendance, which probably has something to do with bitcoin\u2019s value dropping about 60% from its all-time high in 2021.\n\nBitcoin 2023 was mostly a normal business convention. Picture companies in a giant expo hall hawking their wares, small battalions of attractive young salespeople in brightly logoed T-shirts trying to lure passersby with the siren song of conference swag.\n\nBut there were eccentricities \u2014 like bitcoin-themed bathroom products.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking everyone at the conference here if their butt\u2019s clean, because we\u2019re selling butt wipes,\u201d Peter Baraniecki said while manning a table at the convention\u2019s Bitcoin Bazaar, a mini-flea market for bitcoin merchandise.\n\nNext to his bitcoin-themed wipes was a toilet with stickers of non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies like dogecoin adorning the inside of the bowl. Bitcoiners refer to pretty much all other cryptocurrencies as \u201cs-coins.\u201d You can tell from the not-so-subtle toilet context what the \u201cs\u201d stands for.\n\nA toilet for \u201cs-coins\u201d at Bitcoin 2023. (Matt Levin/Marketplace)\n\nSo-called bitcoin maximalists, or bitcoin maxis for short, believe bitcoin is the only digital currency that can and will replace traditional money.\n\nAlthough judging by Baraniecki\u2019s sales, that might take a while.\n\n\u201cWe had about 20 sales so far since this morning,\u201d Baraniecki said. \u201cI would say maybe three or four used bitcoin. The rest were either cash or credit.\u201d\n\nBaraniecki himself said he doesn\u2019t own bitcoin, which was the case for a surprising number of people I talked to at the event. Tali Lindberg has a name for them.\n\n\u201cPrecoiners,\u201d Lindberg said. \u201cPeople who maybe have heard of bitcoin, but they\u2019re on the fence. They don\u2019t know what it is exactly. They don\u2019t trust it yet, they don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nLindberg used to be a precoiner herself. She\u2019s a stay-at-home mom who home-schooled four kids in Kentucky.\n\nHer bitcoin-loving husband developed a board game so she could better understand it. They sold a deluxe edition at the Bitcoin Bazaar for $84.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called HODL Up,\u201d Lindberg said. \u201cThe goal is for each player to HODL as many bitcoin tokens as possible.\u201d\n\nHODL is a bitcoiner credo, basically shorthand for \u201chold on for dear life.\u201d More practically, it means never sell \u2014 which is what Lindberg did as bitcoin\u2019s price fell from its approximately $68,000 peak to its current $27,000.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is every dollar we have to spare we put it into bitcoin,\u201d Lindberg said. \u201cSome people are like, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t put all your eggs into one basket.\u2019 This is the only basket I believe in.\u201d\n\nMany bitcoin maxis actually cheered the downfall of FTX and its boss, Sam Bankman Fried. They detest the idea of a centralized exchange \u2014 or centralized anything.\n\nAnd they\u2019re used to riding the wild swings of the bitcoin market.\n\nBitcoiners could ride a mechanical bull at Bitcoin 2023. (Matt Levin/Marketplace)\n\nBen Bryla climbed on to a mechanical bull in the center of the expo hall. He rode it for a minute and half before finally falling off. That tied his time from last year, which was almost enough to win the competition.\n\n\u201cLast year, first place was an entire bitcoin, which at the time was 40 grand. This year they\u2019ve changed it up, and it\u2019s a whale pass for next year,\u201d Bryla said.\n\nA \u201cwhale pass\u201d is basically a VIP ticket for bitcoin high rollers.\n\nBryla said he takes home 10% of his salary from a global human resources company in bitcoin. Given the news about the traditional financial system lately, he\u2019s not selling.\n\n\u201cEach one of these bank collapses, while the Federal Reserve sits there and tells you that the banking system is fine and there\u2019s nothing to worry about, it\u2019s an advertisement for an egalitarian system like bitcoin,\u201d Bryla said.\n\nAt times, Bitcoin 2023 felt a bit like a libertarian comic-con.\n\nThere\u2019s a reverse Plinko-style game in which you try to navigate a coin away from banks and the Fed. One of the biggest applause lines from keynote speaker Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a knock against COVID lockdowns.\n\nAnd while the bitcoiners were, for the most part, very friendly and welcoming, tens of thousands of them invading your city can be a little annoying to some locals.\n\nOn Friday night at a bar in South Beach, a group of crypto conventioneers joined a karaoke chorus belting out Neil Diamond. Iliana Cordero can spot them pretty easily.\n\n\u201cWhite socks and sneakers,\u201d Cordero said. \u201cSome kind of dumb hat. They don\u2019t have a Miami vibe, like \u2018Look at this.\u2019 They look like they\u2019re on a Carnival Cruise line.\u201d\n\nCordero is a chef and a Miami local. She said her restaurant did business with the bitcoin convention last year.\n\nAnd although she said she never takes payment in bitcoin, she does own some.\n\n\u201cIt just kind of sits there and it\u2019ll do what it does,\u201d Cordero said. \u201cI don\u2019t need that money. So it\u2019s there to grow or to dissipate. We\u2019ll find out.\u201d"

        "title": "Swiss National Bank keynote explores if Bitcoin could oust fiat currencies - Ledger Insights - Ledger Insights",
        "content": "This week, the Swiss National Bank held its Cryptoassets and Financial Innovation conference. A thought-provoking keynote explored whether fiat money could be challenged. If so, could it be usurped by gold, Bitcoin, some inflation-linked token or something else?\n\nThe talk was presented by economist Lawrence H. White, a Senior Fellow at George Mason University and a senior scholar at the Cato Institute. During the speech, he revealed he\u2019d crossed paths with Hal Finney and Nick Szabo, who some believe are Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.\n\nCentral banks lack competition\n\nWith rampant inflation in the 70s, economists devised various proposals to address the issue. One was to impose constraints on central bank policymakers. Hayek observed the problem was a need for more competition. Initially, he suggested opening up economies to foreign fiat currencies, effectively creating competition between central banks. Later he proposed introducing private currencies, which probably would be designed to maintain purchasing power.\n\nToday the major private currency contenders would be gold or Bitcoin. White observed that the way to retain purchasing power is to either commit to repurchase the currency at a fixed price or limit the supply, as is the case in Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and gold are both inflation hedges, the supply mechanisms are very different. In the case of gold, if there is increased demand, higher prices will lead to more production or recycling of gold jewelry. That increases supply, which in turn moderates price over the long term. This was demonstrated with the gold standard. When the U.S. rejoined it in 1879 and departed in 1914, the price was 1% different.\n\nIn contrast, Bitcoin\u2019s supply increases in a predefined way and does not respond to demand. Price inflation might engender more mining activity, but that does not produce more Bitcoins. \u201cIt\u2019s not unfair to say that purchasing power volatility is built into the design,\u201d said White. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem if you want it to be a commonly accepted medium of exchange.\u201d\n\nCould fiat currencies be usurped?\n\nHowever, White sees a shift away from fiat currencies as unlikely, largely because of the network effect benefits of incumbents. The one caveat is runaway inflation, combined with a lack of an alternative fiat currency that is viewed as more stable. He gave examples of Argentinian and Zimbabwean citizens who spontaneously adopted the U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to put themselves on a gold standard or a Bitcoin standard unless there\u2019s no good alternative,\u201d said White. \u201cUnless the dollar is just as unstable.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s advantage over gold is its censorship resistance. However, White believes it could be driven underground, as has happened in China. While that might not eliminate its usage, it prevents it from becoming a mainstream means of payment. Additionally, gold has a wider installed base (bullion, ETFs, jewelry) and its market capitalization is far higher. Hence, in the unlikely event that fiat currency fails, White would back gold over Bitcoin.\n\nHe highlighted some other blockchain alternatives. They include a so-called flatcoin linked to a price index, such as Ampleforth\u2019s SPOT token, which has a market capitalization of less than $ 1 million. Another alternative is to have a cryptocurrency with an elastic supply, such as PraSaga (which White advises.) Prasaga isn\u2019t trying to compete with Bitcoin, instead it focuses on industrial use cases.\n\nWhite\u2019s talk is well worth watching, along with other conference material."

He had been missing for a week after failing to show up for work at the Mercy Hospital in Cassville, Missouri. His unlocked car was discovered near the hospital with his belongings, including his wallet, passport, laptop, and work briefcase, inside. The police did not suspect any foul play in his death.\n\nForsyth was the co-founder of ONFO coin, a referral-based cryptocurrency project based on \u201csocial mining\u201d. He was also an early adopter of Bitcoin and a vocal critic of the U.S. dollar. In 2020, Forbes called him a \"Bitcoin millionaire\" who had a passion for mathematics and blockchain technology.\n\nForsyth's death is the latest in a series of mysterious fatalities among crypto enthusiasts and entrepreneurs. In April, Bob Lee, the creator of Cash App and former technology chief at Square, was stabbed to death in San Francisco.

        "content": "Since January, there have been over 10 million inscriptions on the largest blockchain in the world, and this number continues to grow exponentially.\n\nTo provide some context, the Ordinals Protocol allows for the ordered identification of satoshis, the smallest subdivision of a Bitcoin (BTC), enabling each of them to have an individual identity. From that people can inscribe sats with arbitrary content, creating Bitcoin-native digital artifacts, more commonly known as nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nAmong the various narratives resulting from this technique, the existence of an extremely underground group of individuals who identify, track and trade high-value historical satoshis has come to light. They are known as \u201csat hunters.\u201d\n\nThere is no denying that the Bitcoin ecosystem is undergoing a period of tremendous innovation since the advent of the Ordinals Protocol in early 2023.\n\nTheir main activity involves transacting millions of BTC in search of satoshis that were present in historical moments of the crypto world.\n\nThis practice is known as \u201csat hunting\u201d and can be compared to continuously withdrawing money from a bank in search of rare coins: You withdraw $10,000, keep $1 of rare coins, deposit the remaining $9,999, and repeat the process of withdrawing another $10,000 in a continuous cycle.\n\nRelated: Users will decide if they can still trust Ledger with their seed phrases\n\nThe group that holds the largest amount of rare satoshis is the Rare Satoshi Society, which has already traded more than $1 billion in Bitcoin volume in pursuit of these historical sats.\n\nThey are becoming well-known for providing rare satoshis for the majority of Ordinals experiments and even sold a single satoshi for 0.5 BTC.\n\nAnd it\u2019s fascinating to observe how some Ordinals projects are adopting this narrative. One example is the Nakamoto Whales project, which minted a portion of its collection into rare satoshis from the first thousand mined blocks, including one mined by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nAlongside the deployment of NFTs in rare satoshis, there is also an emerging trend of historically inscribed fungible tokens (BRC-20). DAnTer, a member of the Rare Satoshi Society, recently inscribed a collection, FHAL, onto a satoshi that was mined by the legendary Hal Finney on block 78 with the purpose of democratizing access to such a historical asset for more individuals.\n\nNow, according to DAnTer, we have entered an era where one Bitcoin is no longer equal to one Bitcoin \u2014 and a satoshi becomes equal to infinity.\n\nRelated: Pepe would be ashamed of PEPE investors\n\nAnd although the narrative of historical satoshis still remains underground, fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network are hotter than ever. OKX, one of the largest exchanges in the world, just announced the listing of ORDI, the largest BRC-20 token in terms of market capitalization, while OXBT, one of the most popular BRC-20 tokens, has surpassed Bored Ape Yacht Club in the seven-day volume chart \u2014 just after its launch.\n\nIn February, people were trading Ordinals using Excel spreadsheets due to the lack of infrastructure. Today, just a few months later, major exchanges are joining this movement. Big brands like Bugatti have shown interest in the rare sats narrative, and there is even discussion about smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.\n\nCould this be the phase of the greatest innovation and onboarding in the history of Bitcoin?\n\nLugui Tillier is the chief commercial officer of Lumx Studios, a leading Web3 studio that counts BTG Pactual Bank, the largest investment bank in Latin America, among its investors.

        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat on Wednesday morning in Asia, after briefly breaching the US$28,000 level on Tuesday night. Ether dipped below the US$1,900 mark, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP led the winners following crypto-related legal developments involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Stock futures in the U.S. traded mixed, as investors wait to see if the U.S. debt ceiling deal passes through Congress. The deal faces opposition from some House Republicans. Meanwhile, concerns over further U.S. interest rate hikes and debt issuance continue to limit investor appetite for risk assets.\n\nBitcoin, Ether flat; XRP surges\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.35% over the last 24 hours to US$27,666 at 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was trading 1.92% higher for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s most dominant cryptocurrency reached a high of US$28,044 on Tuesday evening in Asia. However, it soon fell back down below the US$28,000 resistance level.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw outflows totalling US$39m in the week ending May 26, according to a Tuesday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares. Bitcoin-linked products accounted for almost a third of those outflows. The six-week run of outflows totals US$272 million \u2014 an indication that bearish sentiment continues to weigh heavily on the crypto market.\n\nEther inched down 0.13% to US$1,895, but gained 2.66% over the past seven days. The token has been trading around the US$1,900 resistance level since the start of the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower in the past 24 hours, with the exception of XRP, Solana and Litecoin.\n\nXRP led the winners, jumping 6.15% in the past 24 hours to US$0.5209. That rise expanded its weekly gain to 12.75%.\n\nMarkus Thielen, Head of Crypto Research at digital asset service platform Matrixport, suggested in a note that the token\u2019s surge could be linked to the announcement of a settlement reached Monday between the SEC and a former manager at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The former Coinbase employee agreed to SEC charges that he had engaged in insider trading.\n\nThat resolution could, Thielen suggests, benefit Ripple \u2014 the issuer of XRP \u2014 in its own legal dispute with the SEC, leading to gains for XRP.\n\nElsewhere, Dogecoin led the losers. The memecoin dropped 1.03% to US$0.07242, dipping 0.06% for the week.\n\nThe total market cap of cryptocurrencies edged up 0.32% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while the 24-hour market volume inched 2.02% higher to US$30.06 billion.\n\nExcitement returns to NFT market\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.22% to 3,403.49 in the 24 hours to 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, but edged up 0.32% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 22.00% in the past 24 hours to US$18.23 million. That rise was spearheaded by Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) transactions, according to CryptoSlam data. Meanwhile, NFT sales on Bitcoin fell 18.77% to US$3.52 million.\n\nBAYC sales totaled US$2.86 million on Tuesday, almost three times higher than sales of the collection throughout Monday.\n\n\u201cThe rise in BAYC volume is interesting as some of the larger transactions price doesn\u2019t match the traits/rarity,\u201d said Eric Dettman, NFT advisor at CryptoSlam. \u201cThey aren\u2019t washes on paper but there may be some behind the scenes dealing going on.\u201d\n\nBRC-721E token standard was launched on Monday. The initiative allows traders to move their Ethereum-based NFTs to the Bitcoin network. That process is irreversible as it permanently burns the NFT on the Ethereum network before transfer.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll get to see traders\u2019 convictions on the Bitcoin ecosystem play out in real time,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cAt this point, no one can deny that Bitcoin\u2019s NFTs are here to stay, but the question of \u2018Will Bitcoin NFTs flip Ethereum NFTs?\u2019 is another story. I think they will.\u201d\n\nNFT trader sentiment is also seeing a boost from Web3 developments in China and Russia.\n\nOn May 23, China\u2019s national broadcaster CCTV reported on Hong Kong\u2019s recent crypto regulation drive. That unexpected move preceded the release of a Web 3.0 white paper by the municipal government of Beijing. The wide-reaching paper covers sectors including NFTs and the metaverse.\n\n\u201cChina is coming into NFTs and crypto, and Russia will use crypto to settle payments across borders,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThese two major announcements are bringing excitement back to the NFT and crypto markets and lead many to believe that these alone can turn the market around.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures dip before debt ceiling vote\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 12:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipping 0.34%, S&P 500 futures down 0.25%, and the Nasdaq futures losing 0.15%.\n\nInvestors are jittery ahead of the U.S. Congress\u2019 vote on the debt ceiling deal to avoid a default in the world\u2019s biggest economy. The House vote is on Wednesday and could face objections, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAn additional concern for investors is interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve. Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told the Financial Times there was no \u201ccompelling reason to pause\u201d rate hikes in June, citing \u201cembedded, stubborn inflationary pressure,\u201d according to a report on Wednesday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on June 14 to decide on rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 37.0% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 63.0% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 59.6% on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. employment report will be released on Friday, giving another insight into the state of the economy and inflation pressure."

        "title": "What is Bitcoin Really Worth? - Morningstar",
        "content": "Those declaring crypto is dead might want to check the charts. Bitcoin has appreciated by more than 75% so far this year, climbing from a level of $16,540 as of 1 January to $29,218 as of April 30. Over that period, it\u2019s beaten the Morningstar US Market Index by a whopping 69 percentage points.\n\nThere are a few possible reasons for this. Bitcoin underwent a software upgrade late last year that opens its blockchain up to other use cases besides payments, which might have stirred up some interest. As the financial ecosystem around crypto has crumbled, it\u2019s possible that the faithful have returned to their mother ship and stashed their assets where they know they won\u2019t be touched. Gold has also rallied over that same stretch, leading some analysts to conclude that investors more broadly are looking for alternative stores of value as trust in financial institutions has ebbed after the regional bank failures that peppered the first few months of 2023.\n\nAny of these reasons might be compelling, but only because other potential bitcoin investors find them meaningful. Right now, bitcoin is still a bit of a mirror: People will see what they want to see. Returns of 50% are possible because there are very few contrarians in crypto.\n\nUnfortunately, this is equally as true on the way down as it is on the way up. Bitcoin will continue to cycle through boom after bust so long as there\u2019s no good way to value it. Only with cold hard numbers in hand can investors start to probe at the narratives.\n\nThis article represents Morningstar\u2019s first attempt to do so. We will cover four common valuation exercises and evaluate the suitability of each as it relates to bitcoin.\n\n4 Methods for Modeling\n\nThere are four popular models for proxying the value of bitcoin that hail from traditional stock valuation.\n\nTwo measure demand:\n\nTotal Addressable Market\n\nNetwork Effects\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo measure supply:\n\nCost of Production\n\nStock-to-Flow\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will examine the other three models in future pieces; the balance of this article will focus on total addressable market.\n\nInvestors using the total addressable market method take an existing product or industry and estimate the size of that market. From there, they will estimate how much market share a new product could capture, giving them a rough idea of how much it could be worth to consumers.\n\nInvestors might recognise this approach from firms touting that bitcoin could someday displace gold as a store of value. Why all the focus on gold? Primarily it is because, like bitcoin, gold has a theoretical fixed supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, and miners have already minted roughly 19 million as of May 2023; roughly 209,000 tons of gold have ever been mined, leaving approximately 52,000 tons in the ground as of February 2023.\n\nThere are practical reasons to discount this argument, which we have made before. But the narrative persists, with some analysts tempering their assumptions to reach more-reasonable valuations. Even if bitcoin captures just 10% of the market for gold, the thinking goes, it could reach prices as high as $154,000.\n\nFor now, let\u2019s put aside the theory and focus on the math. One problem with that back-of-the-napkin estimate is that gold has another major application that gives it value and scarcity: jewelry. The World Gold Council estimates that jewelers have claimed about half of the world\u2019s aboveground supply of gold.\n\nAs an intangible asset, bitcoin cannot compete with gold on that front. So what we\u2019ve done is scrape that stock from our estimate of the available supply to focus exclusively on financial use-cases. (We assume that no consumers are purchasing gold jewelry to use it as a store of value. We also assume that all nonjewelry storage can be classified as an investment. Both of these assumptions are likely not 100% true, but such are the risks of simple models.)\n\nAfter adjusting for jewelry, our math suggests that bitcoin has attained much greater penetration of the \u201cstore of value\u201d market than other studies claim. At year-end 2022, bitcoin had a market capitalisation of around $318 billion. The world\u2019s financial holdings of gold totaled about $6,528 billion, which means that bitcoin soaked up 4.9% of gold\u2019s market share as a store of value in 2022. Interestingly, bitcoin already passed the forecast 10% threshold back in 2021.\n\nFrom here, an analyst would typically pick a terminal market share and multiply that by the size of the industry to forecast how much a product can grow.\n\nSo, how much bigger could bitcoin get? The unvarnished truth is that no one knows. If we ask Cathie Wood, bitcoin could eclipse 100% of gold\u2019s market cap. If bitcoin recouped its losses and nabbed back 10% of gold\u2019s market share, that would imply a price of $33,910. But market share could also fall back down to less than 2%, where bitcoin has floundered for most of the 2010s, if retail interest continues to dwindle after the slew of crypto blowups of 2022.\n\nRather than relying on guesswork, we will try to apply some rigor to the forecast by using history as a guide. The S-Curve was created by a rural sociologist named Everett Rogers in the 1960s to explain how innovation spreads. It has since become a cornerstone for modeling the rate of adoption for new technologies in a wide range of disciplines, from cancer prevention techniques to social networks.\n\nThe S-Curve models adoption along several distinct phases. Each phase is denoted by the audience it represents: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. Rogers starts with a normal distribution of the entire market, segmenting it across each one of these categories. To build an S-Curve, the populations accumulate, so that the market share of a particular product equals some percentage of the audience it is currently expanding to, plus all of the groups that came before it.\n\nBy this metric, with a 4.9% market share, bitcoin is still in the throes of the early adopter phase. If it crossed over into the early majority phase, it would reach a price of $50,870. If it was to reach the late majority phase, it could surpass $169,000.\n\nGiven how simple they are, there are inherent flaws to relying on S-Curves for financial securities.\n\nS-Curves assume that adoption is cumulative. Put another way, this would imply that users who adopted the technology in an earlier phase do not abandon it. We know from experience that that\u2019s not true: Bitcoin\u2019s market share declined to 4.9% from 13.7% in just a year.\n\nUsers are the unit of measurement for S-Curves, and the model assumes that the relationship between additional users and additional market share is 1:1. This relationship is intuitive for products. If you purchase a PC from Dell, for example, Dell\u2019s revenues will usually increase by the price of that computer. For financial assets, this assumption is a bit more of a reach. It implies that every additional bitcoin wallet opened pushes up bitcoin\u2019s price by a constant amount\u2014a highly improbable condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven once we plug in a forecast market share, using the total addressable market model to derive a price introduces additional wrinkles.\n\nWe assume that the suggested total addressable market, measured by gold\u2019s nonjewelry market capitalisation, stays fixed over time.\n\nWe also assume that bitcoin\u2019s current circulating supply would also be its future circulating supply.\n\nThese two assumptions are clearly oversimplifications. We know that this is not how these assets work in practice: Gold\u2019s market capitalisation grew by 3.7% annualised over the past 12 years, and bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply increases every day as miners approve new blocks.\n\nWhile these assumptions may not be true, they can still be useful. That\u2019s because they point to something important about the design of a total addressable market model: Although there are certainly tweaks that investors can make, it\u2019s not inherently a time-varied approach. There is no end date unless the analyst defines one. That\u2019s a problem because it\u2019s not particularly informative to try to ascribe a future value to an asset when that future remains undefined.\n\nMadeline Hume is a senior research analyst at Morningstar"

        "title": "Could Bitcoin Really Soar 500% Before Its Next Halving? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is now less than one year away from a highly anticipated event known as halving, and crypto analysts are already starting to bump up their price targets. The latest model claims that Bitcoin will reach a price of $160,000 by April 2024. Based on today's price of $27,941, that would imply a rally of nearly 500%.\n\nBut not so fast. While past halvings have led to significant appreciation in the price of the crypto both before and after the event, there is less agreement on how long this rally might last, and even how significant it might be this time around. Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nThe halving is the reduction in the reward for mining a block on the Bitcoin blockchain by one-half. Currently, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins for every block they mine. Beginning in April 2024, they will receive 3.125 bitcoins. This halving event occurs every four years, and will continue to occur like clockwork until all the bitcoins that will ever exist have been mined by the year 2140.\n\nThis feature is designed to make Bitcoin more deflationary over time. It has a maximum lifetime supply of 21 million coins, and there are already 19.4 million in circulation, so it's easy to see how the halving introduces scarcity into the equation. Between now and 2140, only 1.6 million additional bitcoins can ever be mined, and the pace at which this happens is getting slower and slower over time.\n\nImpact of halving on price\n\nSince Bitcoin's launch in 2009, there have been three different halving events: in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Thus, there is (relatively speaking) a significant amount of data to examine to see what the impact on the price might be. After the last halving in 2020, for example, it exploded by 688% over the next 546 days, eventually reaching a high of $67,594. And before that, the crypto's price skyrocketed by an astounding 2,824% in the wake of its 2016 halving, reaching what was then an all-time high of $19,065.\n\nThere was also an impact on the price of Bitcoin before the halving. For example, before the 2020 halving, it was up nearly 20%. Before the 2016 halving, it rose 142%. And before the 2012 halving, it gained 384%.\n\nWill the same pattern happen in 2023-2024?\n\nThus, if you use a similar data set, most models will probably suggest that Bitcoin will rally yet again, both before and after the 2024 halving. As a result, there already have been some remarkable forecasts. The baseline forecast seems to be $100,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nBut in November 2022, crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital put out a price target of $149,000. And in May, one crypto analyst -- using a number of technical trading factors -- came up with a forecast of $160,000 by the time of the next halving. This last forecast, in my opinion, seems to be particularly aggressive. As noted above, the biggest pre-halving rally until now has been 384%.\n\nAlso remember: History is no guarantee of future performance. Just because Bitcoin behaved one way in the past does not mean it will do so again. Moreover, there is always model risk. Different models can come up with different forecasts, depending on which numbers and dates you use. So before you start investing as a result of the latest new price forecast, be careful that you know how it's being calculated.\n\nOther factors to consider\n\nThe big question is whether the upcoming halving is even going to be the biggest catalyst for Bitcoin. The halving is a purely technical event, and does not take into account overall macroeconomic conditions. Thus, any price forecasts need to be balanced with a nuanced understanding of how factors like inflation or recession might spoil the party in 2024. We're already seeing evidence of this, with the digital currency struggling to get past the $30,000 price level due to overall economic weakness.\n\nAt the end of the day, I do think the halving will have a significant positive impact on the digital coin's price. But I'm rethinking how much of an impact. Just based on the simple mathematics involved, it seems like every halving from here on out is going to have less and less impact on the price of the crypto. I'm still bullish on Bitcoin, but I am pumping the brakes when it comes to price forecasts for 2024."

Energy Web hopes that certified miners will get enhanced access to institutional finance and other benefits as they invest in sustainability.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s electricity consumption and environmental impact have drawn criticism,\u201d said Amy Westervelt, head of the GP4BTC initiative at Energy Web, via a press release.\n\n\u201cWhile some leading miners are working towards reducing their carbon footprint, the industry lacks a unified definition and framework for assessing sustainability. Green Proofs for Bitcoin aims to address this gap.\u201d\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors? Access the most comprehensive Company Profiles on the market, powered by GlobalData.

These scores consider operational data, such as location and energy consumption, to assess miners\u2019 use of renewable electricity and demand flexibility. The scoring system aligns with best practices for sustainability leadership in other industries, says Energy Web, and with corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting standards.\n\nThe development of GP4BTC has been a collaborative effort, engaging more than 35 miners, non-government organisations, grid operators, and other participants from the energy and crypto markets. The initiative was launched with five certified sustainable Bitcoin miners, notably Argo Blockchain, Cowa, DMG Blockchain Solutions, Hive Blockchain Technologies, and Gryphon Digital Mining."

His family launched an appeal on his whereabouts on social media soon after.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Beast at the time, his younger brother, Richard Forsyth, said that John Forsyth wouldn\u2019t miss a shift, so it was \u201can immediate red flag.\u201d\n\nAuthorities found Forsyth\u2019s sedan parked less than a mile away from the hospital on May 28.\n\nBeaver Lake in northwest Arkansas, Dr. John Forsyth.

        "content": "While many beginners base their trades on the negativity brought about by devastating events happening in the crypto space, experienced traders base their decisions on different factors, helping them come out on top \u2014 even in a bear market.\n\nSpeaking with Cointelegraph, Dan Tapiero, founder of growth equity funds 10T Holdings and 1RoundTable Partners, shared some of his most important strategies to navigate the market. These include having a broader perspective, and avoiding the influence of feelings and people\u2019s fears. Tapiero explained:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that the space has really grown. It\u2019s not just about the price of Bitcoin or the price of Ethereum. We have five or six companies that actually made more money last year than in the previous year. So, even during the time of a massive drop in the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we\u2019ve had companies do better.\u201d\n\nThe executive also gave examples of sectors within the broad digital asset ecosystem that, according to Tapiero, are not correlated. He explained that in 2022, $8 trillion in stablecoins were settled, the total number of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) minted crossed the one trillion mark, and blockchain gaming took off. Tapiero pointed out that three years ago, these were all zero.\n\n10T Holdings founder Dan Tapiero with Cointelegraph reporter Ezra Reguerra in Dubai, UAE. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nApart from these, the veteran trader also pointed to developments in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and highlighted that despite the space\u2019s locked value going from $200 billion to $50 billion, it was also at zero a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cI found like, you know, young guys in the space don\u2019t have the perspective. Five, six years ago, which is not that long ago, nothing exists. You barely even had Ethereum. It was just Bitcoin (BTC). So, as the space broadens out, the value also increases with it,\u201d he explained.\n\nRelated: Blackrock CEO issues dire warning over \u2018debt ceiling drama\u2019 \u2014 Bullish for Bitcoin?\n\nWhen asked what he thinks about community sentiments and their impact on his strategies, Tapiero said that they can \u201csee it and sense it,\u201d but he\u2019s not interested in these feelings. He believes crypto is a market similar to other currencies, bonds or stocks. He explained:\n\n\u201cMarkets display certain behaviors. I spent my entire life managing a portfolio of financial assets that move around, and honestly, the most important thing is to be able to set your emotion aside and make rational judgments that aren\u2019t impacted by what the news is or what people\u2019s fears are.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these insights, the executive shared his thoughts on the next bull phase. \u201cThe bear phase is finished,\u201d he said. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) went down last year, Tapiero said the market has \u201chad a very nice recovery,\u201d and will have an \u201cexplosive\u201d and broad bull market.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see new highs probably in the second half of 2024, 2025. And I think in that bull phase, we\u2019ll probably hit up to 6 to 8 trillion [crypto market capitalization],\u201d he added.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Moral responsibility\u2019 \u2014 Can blockchain really improve trust in AI?"

        "content": "Bitcoin fell to near US$27,000 in Thursday morning trading in Asia and posted the first monthly loss of the year. Ether and all the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also traded lower, with XRP leading the losers. U.S. equities slid on concerns the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again in June after strong job numbers for April released Wednesday showed inflation is still prevalent. Investors were also jittery ahead of the outcome of the vote by the U.S. Congress to approve the debt ceiling deal.\n\nBitcoin, Ether slide\n\nBitcoin fell 2.35% over the last 24 hours to US$27,124 at 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, but held a weekly gain of 3.78%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency ended May with a loss of 4.96%, the first monthly decline since the start of the year.\n\nThe token met selling pressure after Federal Reserve official Loretta Mester said on Wednesday there was no \u201ccompelling reason to pause\u201d interest rate hikes in June, according to Mikkel Morch, Chairman and Non-Executive Director at investment fund ARK36, in a note shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201c(The remarks from Mester) have had a disruptive impact on various risk assets, including cryptocurrencies,\u201d said Morch. \u201cSimultaneously, the release of discouraging manufacturing data from China has added to the bearish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin and other risk assets.\u201d\n\nEther dropped 1.65% to US$1,874, while trading 5.35% higher for the week and 2.07% higher for the month.\n\nDespite the overall bearish sentiment, \u201cthe market appears more upbeat about the second-largest crypto by market cap, as its deflationary features are supporting prices,\u201d said Jeff Mei, Chief Operating Officer at crypto exchange BTSE, citing data from Ultra Sound Money that showed almost 200,000 Ether have been burnt in the past 30 days.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses in the past 24 hours, with XRP leading the losers.\n\nXRP fell 2.62% to US$0.5088, to lead the losers. Litecoin moved 1.24% lower to US$91.36, but remains up 8.58% for the week as the token\u2019s third halving event draws near, which would reduce the supply of the token.\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, is said to be planning to lay off 20% of employees in June, according to Wu Blockchain on Wednesday citing unnamed sources. Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann later responded on Twitter that \u201cBinance is not cutting 20% of employees as a cost-cutting measure,\u201d but faces \u201ca historic operational challenge to overcome\u201d as the company faces pressure from regulators and needs to reallocate resources.\n\n\u201c(Binance\u2019s rumored job cuts are) a marker that traders will look at when scoping out the health of the market and profitability of crypto businesses and projects,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock. \u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t help that exchange volumes are at an abysmal low compared to the top of 2021-2022.\u201d\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB token dropped 1.85% in the past 24 hours to US$306.28, just holding a weekly gain of 0.13%.\n\nThe total market cap of cryptocurrencies dropped 1.78% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion, while the 24-hour market volume rose 6.96% to US$32.85 billion.\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum NFT sales rise\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.20% to 3,407.30 in the 24 hours to 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, and added 1.24% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 23.59% in the past 24 hours to US$21.77 million, according to CryptoSlam data. NFT sales on the Bitcoin network also gained 22.66% to US$4.40 million.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club saw the biggest sales in the past 24 hours, rising 3.00% to US$2.80 million.\n\nThe Grapes, an Ethereum-based NFT collection launched on Wednesday night, saw the 12th largest sales totaling over US$433,000. The collection has seen over 4,600 transactions in the 12 hours after launch, and reached a price of 0.20 ETH (US$373.16) on early Thursday morning, over five times higher than its mint price at 0.039 ETH.\n\nMeanwhile, NFT scams are undermining confidence. NFT influencer Andrew Wang, with over 189,000 Twitter followers, promoted an NFT collection named Pixel Penguins on Thursday, which claimed to be a charity project to support the Pixel Penguins creator\u2019s fight against cancer. But the supposed charity was revealed to be a scam, with its pseudonymous creator \u201cHopeexist1\u201d deactivating her Twitter account after securing over 61 ETH (US$114,000), according to crypto sleuth ZachXBT.\n\nElsewhere, Twitter user Pauly, who is regarded as the creator of memecoin $PEPE, has raised over US$1.2 million by simply asking people to send their ETH to an account to \u201creceive nothing in return.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall \u2013 not a lot of people are looking to trade, sentiment is rather negative from the scams/Pauly news, price discussion,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nU.S. futures fall amid inflation worries\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 10:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.18%, S&P 500 futures inched down 0.07%, and the Nasdaq futures lost 0.23%.\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indexes slid on Wednesday as investors waited for the outcome of the latest stage of the U.S. debt deal. At approximately 9.30 p.m. ET Wednesday evening, the House passed a bill to suspend the U.S. debt limit and avoid a national default.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cTonight, the House took a critical step forward to prevent a first-ever default and protect our country\u2019s hard-earned and historic economic recovery,\u201d U.S. President Joe Biden said about the outcome of the vote.\n\nBiden urged the Senate to also agree on the bill \u2014 the next stage in the ratification process \u2014 \u201cas quickly as possible,\u201d allowing him to pass it into law.\n\nOn the inflation front, the U.S. Labor Department report for April recorded 10.1 million job openings in April. That figure surpasses analysts\u2019 expectations of 9.375 million. The report also recorded a month-on-month decline of 264,000 in layoffs and discharges.\n\nThe stronger than expected data can be interpreted as \u201ca partial sign of the continued strength of the American labor market,\u201d tweeted Mohamed Aly, El-Erian, Chief Economic Advisor at financial services company Allianz, on Thursday.\n\nSimilarly robust monthly employment data has, in the past, preceded a rise in the U.S. interest rate. However, comments from inside the US Federal Reserve suggest that a so-called \u201chawkish pause\u201d in June ahead of further rate rises later could be the more likely outcome.\n\nFed governor Philip Jefferson said at a financial stability conference in Washington Wednesday that skipping a hike in June \u201cwould allow the Committee to see more data before making decisions about the extent of additional policy firming.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jefferson added that \u201ca decision to hold our policy rate constant at a coming meeting should not be interpreted to mean that we have reached the peak rate for this cycle.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on June 14 to make its decision. The interest rate is now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest level since 2006.\n\nFollowing Jefferson\u2019s speech, the CME FedWatch Tool now predicts a 62.2% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June. The 37.8% chance it gives for another 25 basis-point rate hike is a significant decrease from the 63.0% chance reported on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates added to equities section)"

        "content": "Cuba had its first-ever Bitcoin-only meetup over the weekend, with more than 60 people attending. It was hosted by Cuba Bitcoin at the Bitcoin-friendly bar and restaurant Pazillo. Cuba Bitcoin is a lively group of Bitcoin (BTC) advocates and activists whose discussions on Telegram between anonymous social media accounts that hide people\u2019s identities had yet to make it into the real world.\n\nThe Cuba Bitcoin community, complete with emojis to hide faces.\n\nCuba\u2019s foray into Bitcoin signifies a departure from the centralized economic model that has shaped Cuba\u2019s economy for decades. Despite limited internet access, financial constraints and a socialist-styled government, the meetup underscored that Cubans are increasingly turning to crypto as a means of financial freedom and an \u201cexit\u201d from the local economy.\n\nCuba Bitcoin co-founder Forte11 (not his real name) told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cThe mission of the meetup is to educate, not convince Cubans about the potential of Bitcoin in Cuba. Each person has the freedom of expression to decide what they want to do. It\u2019s education, education and education first and foremost.\u201d\n\nWhile Bitcoin meetups in the West might be dominated by white, middle-aged men, Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin-only meetup included a wide range of characters. From small business owners and software developers to teenage students and grandmothers, more than 60 people turned up. Paco de la India, a Bitcoin vlogger and evangelist, also attended, delivering a talk on Bitcoin adoption around the world.\n\nAlthough Cuba is technically a centrally planned economy, the state recently relaxed laws on private business ownership. This arena is the target market for Bitcoin merchant adoption, as it is now legal to accept cryptocurrencies for goods and services thanks to recent crypto regulations passed in Cuba.\n\nTo demonstrate this, the group sold Cuba Bitcoin T-shirts for 1,000 satoshis ($0.30) so attendees could learn about the layer-2 Lightning Network \u2014 and they sold out.\n\nPaying for T-shirts via Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network during the meetup.\n\nNonetheless, the main talk of the day revolved around how to get one\u2019s hands on Bitcoin. In a country where mobile internet penetration remains relatively low and smartphones are not yet ubiquitous, downloading Bitcoin applications or wallets is out of reach for many Cubans.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, due to the United States trade embargo, familiar exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini are not welcome in Cuba. As a result, Cubans tend to buy Bitcoin the OG way, through peer-to-peer exchange.\n\nForte11 introduces \u201cC\u201d (face hidden) ahead of their talk on buying Bitcoin peer-to-peer.\n\nBitcoin Cuba co-founder \u201cC\u201d delivered a talk on how to buy Bitcoin peer-to-peer through Telegram trading groups. Through a Lightning-enabled tipping bot on Telegram, Cubans can buy Bitcoin in exchange for Cuban pesos or the Cuban Moneda Libremente Convertible, or MLC \u2014 a \u201cdollar-backed,\u201d government-owned stablecoin. Mobile transfers can also make purchases as more and more Cubans access government-run banking services. Most trades in the Telegram groups range between $0.20 and $50. (The average Cuban earns just $40 a month.)\n\nRelated: \u2018The Bitcoin Standard\u2019 author becomes economic adviser to El Salvador\n\nWell-known Cuban crypto enthusiast Erich Garcia Cruz also attended the meetup. He told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cUsing Bitcoin, you can be a freedom person. We have a lot of opportunity here if we teach all the businesses to use Bitcoin as a payment method, to use Bitcoin as a freedom tool \u2014 as that\u2019s the path.\u201d\n\nNow more than 10 businesses in Cuba\u2019s capital, Havana, accept Bitcoin for goods and services. Buoyed by the success of the first Cuba Bitcoin meetup, the community intends to set up regular future meetups and events.\n\nThis interview is part of an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary about Bitcoin adoption in Cuba.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miner Bitfarms sold 414 BTC, representing 90.19%, of its mined 459 BTC in May, according to a June 1 statement.\n\nAccording to the statement, the miner generated $11.3 million from the sold assets, reducing its debt by $1.8 million, leaving a balance of $17.4 million as of May 31.\n\nBTC production\n\nWhen Bitfarms BTC production is viewed on the month-on-month metrics, its production rose 21% from the 379 BTC recorded in April.\n\nOn the year-to-date metric, its Bitcoin production stands at 2,135 BTC, representing an 18.74% increase from the 1798 BTC recorded during the same period last year.\n\nSpeaking on the increased production, Ben Gagnon, the chief mining officer of the firm, pointed out that the increased production was \u201clargely due to a temporary spike in BTC transaction fees.\u201d\n\nIn May, CryptoSlate reported that Bitcoin network recorded a sharp spike in transaction fees thanks to the introduction of the Ordinals Protocol.\n\nAdditionally, Bitfarms added 45 BTC to its treasury in May\u2014 bringing its total to 510 BTC, worth $13.8 million.\n\nThe miner noted that its energy curtailment activity in Quebec fully subsided during the previous month.\n\nDelivery of 2900 mining machines\n\nThe BTC mining company further revealed that it took delivery of 2900 mining machines in Argentina. The miner said the machines were part of the 6200 machines ordered in April, and the remaining 3300 machines would be delivered and installed in June.\n\nBitfarms CEO Geoff Morphy said the machine deliveries aided the company\u2019s organic growth target of 6.0 EH/s from the end of Q4 2023 to the end of Q3 2023. Morphy added:\n\n\u201cWe are focused on organic and other growth opportunities that bring value and accretive cash flow to us ahead of the Halving expected in April 2024.\u201d\n\nFollowing news of its improved production and plans for further growth, Bitfarms\u2019 BITF stock is up 0.30% to $1.20 as of press time, according to Google Finance data.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Early Bitcoin (BTC) investor and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate Roger Ver claimed that Ethereum, not Bitcoin, will be responsible for driving the bulk of new users towards crypto.\n\nOn a May 31 episode of the Show Me The Crypto podcast, Ver \u2014 labeled \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d for his early Bitcoin advocacy \u2014 said that despite Ethereum\u2019s scaling issues and the other layer-one \u201cclones\u201d that have popped up in its wake, the Ethereum ecosystem is still where the action is:\n\n\u201cEven though Ethereum doesn\u2019t have the biggest market cap compared to Bitcoin, I think Ethereum is the front-runner in terms of driving worldwide adoption.\u201d\n\nVer praised the rise of Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible (EVM) blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions such as Polygon (MATIC) that can help share some of the load away from the main chain.\n\nVer provides an account of the \u201ccivil war\u201d that occurred in the early days of Bitcoin between Etheruem\u2019s co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Bitcoin core developers.\n\nDisagreements over the use of smart contracts and moving away from the idea of blockchains being used purely as currency or stores of value eventually drove Buterin to develop Ethereum, Ver noted:\n\n\u201cAll of that would have been built on top of Bitcoin if not for the scaling civil war that happened. These Bitcoin core developers hate Vitalik, and they basically drove him from the project to go and create Ethereum, and more power to him for that.\u201d\n\nVer also spoke on the recent Ledger debate, calling the controversial Recover service \u201cdisappointing.\u201d The service allows users to store their encrypted seed phase with external custodians to safeguard against loss; Ver said that while it\u2019s fine for people to have custodial accounts and choose to recover their keys if they wish, the ethos of crypto is centered on having full control of your assets at all times.\n\nRelated: Hybrid rollups: The silver bullet for scalability and security on Ethereum\n\nIn January, Ver was sued by a trading unit of the crypto lending firm Genesis for failing to pay some $20.8 million in unsettled crypto options.\n\nVer claimed in a January Reddit post that he had \u201csufficient funds\u201d to pay the outstanding sum but argued that because Genesis was no longer solvent, he was not legally required to uphold his end of the deal.\n\nLast year, Ver made headlines for allegations of defaulting on a debt. CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb claimed Ver owed the firm $47 million USD Coin (USDC) and was bound by a written contract. On June 28, Ver denied these claims without directly mentioning the company.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

        "content": "Yuan stablecoin team reportedly arrested\n\nOn May 31, local news outlet PANewsLab reported that the developers for the offshore Chinese yuan and Hong Kong dollar stablecoin issuer CNHC had lost contact or had been taken away by law enforcement officials. A photo shows what appears to be an empty office building at CNHC\u2019s Shanghai division with the following message posted:\n\n\u201cThe building\u2019s assets have been seized by law enforcement; vandalism is prohibited.\u201d\n\nIn March, CNHC raised $10 million in its Series A, led by KuCoin Ventures, Circle and IDG Capital. The team said back then that it planned to use the funds for \u201cexpansion in the Asia Pacific Region\u201d and was in the process of moving its headquarters from the Cayman Islands to Hong Kong.\n\nThe reported move appears to be part of a wider crackdown on cryptocurrencies by Chinese authorities. On May 24, Asia Express reported that tokens of Singaporean inter-blockchain communications protocol Multichain had plunged 30% on a delayed backend upgrade and rumors of Chinese police arrest of its core developers.\n\nThough Multichain says that it is still operational, it stated on June 1 that it is still \u201cunable to contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for maintenance,\u201d and as a result, the protocol would need to suspend a number of affected cross-chain services.\n\nIn the past two days, the Multichain protocol has experienced multiple issues due to unforeseeable circumstances. The team has done everything possible to maintain the protocol running, but we are currently unable to contact CEO Zhaojun and obtain the necessary server access for\u2026 \u2014 Multichain (Previously Anyswap) (@MultichainOrg) May 31, 2023\n\nHong Kong opens up retail crypto licensing\n\nDespite censorship and bans in mainland China, the adoption of cryptocurrency exchange regulation in Hong Kong has proceeded as scheduled. On May 31, the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Consortium was formed to approve the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap for listing and to conduct quarterly reviews of registered digital asset exchanges to ensure compliance with licensing regulations that took effect on June 1.\n\nOn another front, according to a research report published by multichain wallet provider BitKeep, notable crypto projects such as Avalanche, Conflux, EOS and Fantom have all joined Hong Kong\u2019s Web3Hub ecosystem fund unveiled in April. With a budget of $10 million, the fund will incentivize Web3 projects to set up subsidiaries or headquarters in the special administrative region of China. The fund is headed by Paul Chan Mo-Po, financial secretary of Hong Kong SAR.\n\nDespite the growing traction, BitKeep researchers reminded that HK regulations remain strict for the time being:\n\nThe new regulations clearly limit the types of tokens that can be traded and the types of services that exchanges can provide. Cryptocurrencies must meet the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) strict regulations, which emphasize that only non-security tokens can be traded, have a history of at least 12 months, and the token has been included in two cryptocurrency indices.\n\nIn addition, exchanges are prohibited from providing wealth management products, as well as the provision of lending and deposit services, along with derivative transactions such as perpetual crypto contracts. \u201cHowever, the regulator recognizes the importance of derivatives trading in the encrypted market and will conduct further research and consideration,\u201d researchers noted.\n\nWeChat allows BTC price quotes\n\nAs of June 1, WeChat, China\u2019s largest social media app with over 1 billion users, has indexed Bitcoin price quotes in its search queries. The move is significant, considering that China has pretty much banned all crypto-related activities such as exchanges, crypto mining, and fiat-crypto on-ramping since 2021.\n\n\n\nHowever, if history is any guide, the WeChat Bitcoin search query probably won\u2019t last for long. Formerly, billion-user platforms China Central Television and Chinese TikTok variant Douyin have allowed something similar, only to have authorities pull them down just days after launch.\n\nBitcoin price quotes are now publicly available (WeChat)\n\nAll Nippon Airways launches NFT marketplace\n\nOn May 30, All Nippon Airways (ANA), the largest airline in Japan with over $12.2 billion in revenue in the last fiscal year, launched an aeronautical-themed NFT marketplace dubbed \u201cANA GranWhale.\u201d Developers wrote:\n\n\u201cNFTs have been used mainly in fields such as art and music as a technology for expressing ownership of digital assets. This time, the ANA Group will apply NFT to the aviation industry.\u201d\n\nAs its inaugural step, ANA GranWhale will debut aerial photographer Luke Ozawa\u2019s first-ever digital photo in his career as an NFT with an asking price of 100,000 yen ($719). The second installment, starting on June 7, will feature a 3-D model NFT conversion of the first special paint Boeing 787 aircraft launched by ANA. The NFT marketplace\u2019s development began last August as part of ANA\u2019s vision of building a Web3 virtual travel platform.\n\n\u201cWith a view to commercializing NFTs as specialty products from various parts of Japan, we aim to improve the value of customer experience, including local and overseas, through the \u2018GranWhale NFT marketplace.'\u201d\n\nAn ANA GranWhale NFT (All Nippon Airways)\n\nFed inspires Astar Network to revamp tokenomics\n\nOn May 28, Sota Watanabe, the founder of Japanese blockchain Astar (ASTR) Network, expressed his desire to revamp the protocol\u2019s tokenomics, saying that even the United States government was targeting an inflation rate of 2%, compared to levels of around 8.4% currently. Drawing further inspiration from the Federal Reserve, Watanabe proposed mirroring the Fed\u2019s meeting decisions every quarter or every six months and updating the blockchain\u2019s token inflation rate on a variety of factors, writing:\n\n\u201cDecentralizing one of the roles of the FED can be a challenge but also an interesting trial.\u201d\n\nThe crypto executive said he wished to either fix ASTR\u2019s total supply and make the inflation rate smaller and smaller such as in Bitcoin, or automatically decide the inflation rate based on network usage, as in Ethereum, or use a mix of both models.\n\n\n\nA multichain decentralized application proposal, Astar recently launched the second iteration of its smart contracts, supporting both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly Virtual Machine (WASM VM) on its mainnet for developing new cross-chain apps.\n\nBitFlyer and the Travel Rule\n\nAccording to a recent announcement, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer will comply with the country\u2019s Financial Services Agency\u2019s new Travel Rule starting June 1. The Travel Rule states that a crypto asset exchange operator sending crypto assets at the request of a user shall provide specific information about the sender and the recipient to the exchange operator receiving the transfer.\n\nIn addition, further restrictions are imposed on crypto transfers to any of the 21 countries, including Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Bahamas, Hong Kong, and the U.S., utilizing the Coinbase-led Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST).\n\nBitFlyer clients who wish to transfer crypto to any of the 21 TRUST countries can only send Bitcoin or Ethereum and select ERC-20 tokens. Such requirements do not apply to transfers to addresses identified with any of the remaining non-TRUST countries. As told by bitFlyer:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the travel rule is to prevent the ability for terrorists and other criminals from using digital fund transfer systems as well as track unauthorized use.\u201d"

        "content": "Trading Bitcoin (BTC) is not easy, given the relatively high volatility of the cryptocurrency, its low correlation to other asset classes, and its reaction to various factors that can come from both the crypto industry and traditional finance.\n\nLike the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies, which are mostly driven by macroeconomic factors, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can become volatile when the Federal Reserve surprises with its interest rate decision. However, Bitcoin can also react to the collapse of a major crypto exchange like FTX. Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to predict where the next big trigger may come from, which is why Bitcoin traders should pay closer attention to market analysis on all fronts.\n\nWhere is Bitcoin today and what to expect?\n\nIn 2023, Bitcoin experienced a period of recovery, with the price starting the year near $16,500 and peaking in mid-April above $31,000 to reach its highest level since the beginning of June 2022.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe recent banking crisis has helped Bitcoin, with mid-sized banks like Silvergate, Signature and Silicon Valley Bank failing within days of each other in March this year. Expectations that the Fed will continue to raise rates at a slow pace have provided additional bullish support.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seen some correction in May amid regulatory uncertainty and ongoing concerns that the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations could fail and lead to a default.\n\nStill, crypto believers expect systemic risks to push Bitcoin to new highs this year. For example, U.S. venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan even bet $1 million that BTC would exceed $1 million by June this year. He said that hyperinflation would hit the U.S. dollar, causing the USD value of a Bitcoin to skyrocket.\n\nWhile the $1 million outlook may seem far-fetched, the upcoming halving event can lay the foundation for another record price this year or next.\n\nIn order to evaluate trading opportunities and understand Bitcoin\u2019s next moves, active traders should spend more time on market analysis. By scanning the market regularly, traders can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions.\n\nMarket analysis can help traders find the best entry and exit points to make the most of Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations. Integrating a trading bot into the trading process can enhance the benefits of market analysis by bringing automation and implementing risk management tools. In addition, most trading bots focus on technical analysis to determine the best entry and exit points based on support and resistance levels, indicators and volume data, among others.\n\nThis trading bot helps users automate trading and benefit from BTC fluctuations\n\nConducting in-depth analysis and leveraging automation offered by trading bots can lead to lucrative opportunities in the Bitcoin market. TradeSanta is a relevant example of a trading bot with many features to help novice and experienced traders deal with Bitcoin price fluctuations.\n\nWith TradeSanta, users can create customized trading bots within 5 minutes. Once ready, these bots can work in both spot and futures markets. The application monitors the market day and night to find better opportunities. It has a built-in trading terminal to manage all portfolios from one place.\n\nThe trading bot helps many traders take advantage of the cryptocurrency market without spending much time. Many have full-time jobs but still want to get exposure to Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and this is where TradeSanta comes in handy.\n\nSince making an informed decision requires time and effort to analyze the markets, busy users can copy trade from TradeSanta\u2019s community traders or use top-performing bots to implement better trading strategies. Users can browse and use successfully tested strategies and choose the ones they like by exchange, strategy, template, market, or trading pairs.\n\nSource: TradeSanta\n\nTradeSanta also allows users to benefit from top-performing bots by using copy trading services to implement better trading strategies.\n\nTraders who don\u2019t want to rely on third parties can use TradeSanta to trade on their own and automate many processes. For example, they can improve risk management by leveraging the stop-loss feature that sets a limit on how much traders are willing to lose in a position. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and implementing reliable risk management measures is imperative. Using the stop-loss feature can help traders minimize their losses.\n\nMany traders exit too early or wait too long to close a position, resulting in missed profits or losses. TradeSanta's trading bot helps users to set their individual strategies and risk profile, and also to exit their positions at the right time. Moreover, traders can optimize their trading strategies by using fundamental analysis and TradeSanta's tools to open long and short positions.\n\nIn addition, users can discuss trading strategies 24/7, get the latest market updates and recommendations from experienced traders and the community, and be quickly notified about all TradeSanta\u2019s changes and improvements.\n\nLearn more about TradeSanta"

        "content": "Dr. Saifedean Ammous, the author of an explanatory book about Bitcoin (BTC) called The Bitcoin Standard, has been appointed the economic adviser to the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador.\n\nOn May 30, the Office announced that the Austrian economist had joined the team as its advisor for matters related to various economic policies.\n\nDr. Ammous\u2019 now-famous book was first published in April 2018. It analyzes the transition between solid stores of value to inflated assets and fiat currencies, traces the history of money and aims to show how civilizations have changed with their monetary systems.\n\nRegarding the new position, he tweeted on May 30 that he was \u201cexcited\u201d to work in the office in \u201cthe first country to adopt a Bitcoin standard!\u201d\n\nWhen the author of the Bitcoin Standard met the leader of Bitcoin Country, great things were bound to happen.\n\n\n\nWe are excited to announce that @saifedean is joining us as Economic Advisor to the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador.\n\n\n\nWelcome to the winning team, Dr Ammous! pic.twitter.com/LyIljvKvtz \u2014 The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) May 30, 2023\n\nSpeaking to local media outlet Diario El Salvador on May 30, Ammous said, \u201cWhat makes Bitcoin unique is that it gives you the opportunity to have a strong asset that doesn\u2019t depreciate over the years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have money that depreciates over time, there is no point in saving and it makes sense to get into debt,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you continue to accumulate Bitcoin for the next five years, there is a good chance that El Salvador will be debt free.\u201d\n\nThe National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) reported that Dr. Ammous recently traveled to El Salvador to lecture students of CUBO+, a Bitcoin and Lightning Network developers program to teach locals the code and concepts.\n\nHe also met with President Nayib Bukele and shared his thoughts on the \u201cremarkable benefits of the policy of economic liberty.\u201d\n\nThe ONBTC stated that Dr. Ammous declined any remuneration for the role and was only interested in supporting President Bukele\u2019s Bitcoin policy.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s National Bitcoin Office was created in November 2022 by Bukele to manage all things crypto-related.\n\nRelated: Strike moves global headquarters to El Salvador, expands to 65 countries\n\nAmerican broadcaster Max Keiser and television presenter Stacy Herbert are also part of Bukele's Bitcoin team, in addition to the recently appointed professor.\n\nMax Keiser commented that The Bitcoin Standard \u201c\u2018Orange Pilled\u2019 millions, including [MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor] and many corporate and financial heavyweights who keep adding Bitcoin to their coffers daily.\u201d\n\nMagazine: What it\u2019s actually like to use Bitcoin in El Salvador"

        "content": "What is Bitcoin? (Explain Like I\u2019m 5)\n\nBitcoin is like a special kind of money that exists only on the internet. It was created in 2009 and works in a different way than regular money. Instead of being controlled by banks or governments, bitcoin is managed by a network of computers all around the world.\n\nImagine you have a toy that you want to share with your friends, but instead of giving it directly to them, you give them a special code. That code represents the toy, and your friends can use it to trade or give it to someone else. That\u2019s how bitcoin works.\n\nBitcoin is stored in a digital wallet on your computer or smartphone, and you can send it to other people just like sending an email. Every transaction is recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain, which makes it very secure and difficult to cheat.\n\nBitcoin is a special kind of internet money that is managed by a network of computers.\n\nOne interesting thing about bitcoin is that there will only ever be a limited number of them. It\u2019s like having a limited edition of something valuable. Some people believe that because of this limited supply and growing popularity, the value of bitcoin may go up over time.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that bitcoin can be very volatile. Its value can go up and down a lot in a short time, so it\u2019s considered a risky investment. That\u2019s why it\u2019s often recommended to only invest a small portion of your money in bitcoin and hold onto it for a long time, like five years or more.\n\nIn conclusion, bitcoin is a special kind of internet money that is managed by a network of computers. It offers the possibility of secure and decentralized transactions, but it\u2019s important to be aware of its volatility and consider it as a long-term investment.\n\n\ufeff\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nJust like adding a special toy to your collection of toys, including a small portion of quality crypto assets like bitcoin in your investment plan can be exciting and potentially bring more value over time. It\u2019s important to remember that while crypto assets can be fun and have the potential to grow in value, they can also be risky. By sticking to a long-term investment strategy and only investing a small part of your money in crypto, you can enjoy the potential benefits while minimizing the chances of losing too much.\n\nBuild your wealth with our proven crypto strategy.

        "title": "Someone Bought a Loaf of Bread With a Bitcoin Wallet Baked Inside - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Yacht parties, tank tops, McLarens: For the last three years, the eponymous annual Bitcoin conference has taken root in Miami, celebrating the excess of crypto\u2019s nouveau riche while showcasing a unique and particularly masculine strain of financialized tribalism.\n\nThough the conference\u2019s latest iteration last month featured notably smaller crowds and less exuberance than in past years, it also appears to have broken new barriers for a new and very different kind of eye-popping excess. On May 18, pseudonymous conceptual artist OONA sold a loaf of bread to a collector for 0.5 BTC, or just over $13,400 worth.\n\nThe sale was not a trick or a gag. The loaf was real, perishable country bread. It was really sold to a man, Vladimir Kravets, who did in fact pay thousands of dollars for it.\n\nIn fairness, the loaf\u2014made in partnership with Bitcoin NFT marketplace DIBA\u2014was unlike other grocery store varieties, as it contained a hardware wallet that stored an undisclosed amount of BTC. But neither the artist nor Kravets plan to disclose the amount.\n\nThat may be because the actual value of \"Bit.Bread,\" as the piece is titled, has nothing to do with money itself. As with OONA\u2019s previous works, it instead investigates the perception of value, particularly as that perception pertains to gender\u2014an often fraught subject in the male-dominated crypto industry.\n\n\u201cIt fundamentally investigates the ways in which this technology is more progressive than the people that use it,\u201d OONA told Decrypt of \"Bit.Bread.\"\n\nSince 2021, OONA has created works of performance art at crypto conferences, always sporting glasses and a draped mask that conceals her identity. Her work has focused on the treatment and perception of women in crypto, and the ways in which crypto\u2014a technology the artist believes can financially and politically liberate and empower people of all backgrounds\u2014has emerged within a culture that she believes does not adequately respect or include women.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Art Basel Miami last December, OONA, with the help of performance artist Lori Baldwin, auctioned off a cup of her own breast milk\u2014milked live in front of a large audience\u2014before being escorted away by conference security. The piece, \"Milking the Artist,\" received a high bid of $200,000.\n\nThey're both part of a progression of performance art activations, as detailed in a recent blog post by OONA, including tokenizing and auctioning off butter that she had churned. It's a juxtaposition between the \"permanent\" and \"perishable,\" as she describes it.\n\nThat piece and \"Bit.Bread\" both riff on edible symbols of the kitchen, in an effort to interrogate the value placed on women in crypto-related environments. That value is typically minimal, and often reduced to sexualization and objectification, according to the artist.\n\nOONA (left) alongside an unidentified actor hired for the performance. Image: Alejandra Bernal\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the degree of crypto-specific sexism that OONA has repeatedly, personally encountered has generally risen with the tide of crypto prices and speculative frenzy.\n\n\u201cAt the 2022 Avalanche Summit, I was asked what my hourly rate was at least five times, because people assumed that I was a prostitute,\u201d OONA recounted. \u201cGoing back this year, most conversations were about my performance art.\u201d\n\nSame thing at Bitcoin Miami: Last year, during the waning days of the bull market, OONA said that she had to repeatedly fight off men intent on trying to rip off her mask to reveal her face. This year, in the doldrums of the bear market, such an invasion of her artistic and physical privacy never once occurred.\n\nMinted by Dance: Inside Art Blocks' Latest Immersive Digital Art Collection\n\nIn that sense, \"Bit.Bread\" can be interpreted as a reflection on the relationship between speculation and gender. So far, crypto\u2019s speculative excesses have typically encouraged a hyper-masculine subculture, one personified by the \u201ccrypto bro\u201d stereotype.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean speculation is itself harmful, according to OONA. On the contrary, speculation is at the heart of Bitcoin\u2019s promise as a tool and value system that she believes will hopefully, eventually, lift up people of all backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI wanted to connect speculation around the value of women with speculation around Bitcoin,\u201d she said, adding that both \"involve a new set of knowledge, a new way of interacting, and a new way of perceiving self-sovereignty.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to correct the date that the bread was sold."

        "content": "Blackrock CEO Laurence Fink believes the recent \u201cdrama\u201d around the United States debt ceiling has deteriorated global trust in the U.S. dollar, something that other analysts predict could provide some tailwinds for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nFink\u2019s comments came as U.S. House of Representatives on May 31 passed a highly-anticipated bill to lift the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling. The bill now goes to the Senate, which is expected to spend a few days debating it. The U.S. Treasury has indicated that the deadline for raising the debt ceiling was June 5. Any later, the country could begin defaulting on its debts.\n\n314-117: The House passes the Biden-McCarthy debt ceiling agreement, raising the debt limit until 2025 and instituting discretionary spending caps for two years.\n\n\n\n71 Republicans and 46 Democrats voted \u201cno\u201d on the bill. pic.twitter.com/RdU42whDd5 \u2014 The Recount (@therecount) June 1, 2023\n\nAccording to a May 31 report by Reuters, Fink told the attendees of a Deutsche Bank financial services conference that he expects at least two more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in the coming months, claiming that he\u2019d seen \u201cno evidence\u201d of overall inflation being reduced.\n\n\u201cI believe we\u2019ll have a resolution, ... but let\u2019s be clear, the United States is jeopardizing its reserve currency status.\u201d\n\nMany Bitcoin advocates and cryptocurrency investors see BTC as a hedge against inflation and debt fears brought on by central banks increasing overall monetary supply.\n\nJosh Gilbert, a markets analyst with eToro, told Cointelegraph that the debt ceiling drama brings Bitcoin into the spotlight once again, as investors may seek finite-supply safe haven assets outside the constraints of the current financial system.\n\n\u201cThe debt ceiling deal once again highlights Bitcoin\u2019s utility because it\u2019s essentially a break away from the traditional financial system. Given its finite supply, it\u2019s free from the issues that the U.S. government is facing right now,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Gilbert notes that while the U.S. banking crisis and the debt-ceiling debacle highlights the inherent utility of an asset like Bitcoin, any investors hoping for current events to provide a massive surge in the value of Bitcoin should tone down their expectations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more fear than optimism in the short term due to the uncertainty of these issues and the liquidity problems they will cause,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cWhen the banking crisis happened, it dialed down inflation and rate hike expectations, which is why we saw Bitcoin rally.\u201d\n\nThese sentiments were echoed by Matteo Greco, a research analyst at investment firm Fineqia International, who told CNBC that the current downward pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price is due primarily to investor fears of the U.S. reaching the debt ceiling.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin hodlers exited \u2018capitulation\u2019 above $20K, new metric hints\n\nTypically when central banks raise interest rates, investors choose to take their money out of risky assets like cryptocurrencies and growth stocks.\n\n\u201cGiven Bitcoin was so depressed in 2022, the expectations of this high-interest rate environment changing saw investors take an opportunity to buy Bitcoin at heavy drawdowns. Rate hike expectations have changed significantly so far this year and in the last few weeks,\u201d Gilbert added.\n\nOn Gilbert's assessment, if Fink\u2019s fears of further rate hikes come true, this could see the price of Bitcoin fall further from its current price. If the inverse happens, and the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hiking cycle in June, Gilbert says that investors can expect to see some positive price action for Bitcoin.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin over the last year.

        "title": "What is a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. Since the price of Bitcoin tends to rise and fall dramatically, investors are always looking for a tool to streamline making efficient investment choices.\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is one of the many tools invented to create an easy visual guide to investing in this cryptocurrency. As the price of Bitcoin rises and falls, the rainbow chart is designed to help investors determine the appropriate times to buy and sell their tokens. It also allows you to compare Bitcoin\u2019s current price to historical trends.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart and how you can efficiently build your investment portfolio.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart reflects a logarithmic growth curve.\n\nThe chart uses various colors to highlight good times to buy or sell Bitcoin.\n\nAlthough a helpful visual, investors should look beyond the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart when making investment decisions.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a tool that investors use to assess the current value of the cryptocurrency in relation to the big picture. Within the chart, you\u2019ll see a rainbow of colors that reflects a logarithmic growth curve, which investors use as a mathematical tool to forecast the possible future price of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen looking at the rainbow chart, you\u2019ll also see the price of Bitcoin over time. Notably, the chart\u2019s designers didn\u2019t want daily fluctuations in price to throw off its data. Instead, the chart ignores the noise of market movements throughout the day to focus on the overarching Bitcoin price trends.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin so Volatile?\n\nBitcoins are produced through a process called mining. Miners are nodes in Bitcoin\u2019s network that solve complex computational math problems to earn the next \u201cblock\u201d of Bitcoins. Mining has a dual purpose: minting new Bitcoins that enter circulation and auditing the blockchain the make sure all transactions are valid and no double-spending is occurring.\n\nBecause Bitcoin mining requires robust hardware and significant energy, it\u2019s costly, slow, and only sometimes financially rewarding. Still, it has attracted considerable interest in recent years because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain and its status as a kind of modern precious metal.\n\nUnlike the gold standard or fiat currency, Bitcoin is a new and mostly untested currency. It\u2019s not used in most people\u2019s everyday lives and has yet to be accepted by most retailers and vendors as a legitimate form of payment.\n\nBitcoin is volatile because its price is dependent on supply and demand. The price will swing depending on how many Bitcoins are in circulation, how much people are willing to pay for the tokens, and how close the currency is to its 21 million Bitcoin limit.\n\nThis limit was purposefully put in place by Bitcoin\u2019s inventor so miners couldn\u2019t keep minting coins to the point of causing wild price fluctuations. Hype for Bitcoin in the media or negative press can also lead to volatile Bitcoin prices. For example, some experts argued the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to increased interest in cryptocurrency products, pushing up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat happened to Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2022?\n\n2022 was a particularly volatile year for economies worldwide. Inflation in the United States led to the Federal Reserve instituting a series of aggressive rate hikes, which made borrowing more expensive to reduce discretionary spending. As rates increased, they damaged corporate profits, and many tech companies laid off thousands of employees.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine also led to widespread economic uncertainty last year. Energy prices skyrocketed, particularly in Europe, as access to Russian energy sources became limited.\n\nBitcoin saw its price fall from over $60,000 at the end of 2021 to under $20,000 at the end of 2022. The collapse of FTX in November 2022 marked a particularly low point for Bitcoin, as investor confidence in the speculative asset seemed low.\n\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin has since rebounded and is seeing positive growth in 2023. As inflation and rate hikes ease up, consumers are starting to spend more and feel more comfortable putting money toward something as risky as Bitcoin.\n\nWho Created the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart hit the scene when a Reddit user, Azop, introduced the chart to track the price of Bitcoin. The chart is meant to predict future market trends without the distractions of daily market volatility.\n\nHow Does the Chart Work?\n\nThe chart superimposes the price of Bitcoin onto a rainbow. Since the logarithmic growth curve intends to forecast the future price of Bitcoin, different colors are intended to highlight the prime opportunities for buying or selling it.\n\nIn general, investors use this chart as a long-term valuation tool. But the predictions made within the rainbow chart aren\u2019t necessarily accurate. It\u2019s simply one way to assess Bitcoin\u2019s current price levels quickly.\n\nAt the end of each 24 hours, the chart is updated with the daily close price. With that, you\u2019ll filter through the fluctuations within a single day to better assess the bigger picture.\n\nA Guide To The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart\n\nThe appeal of the rainbow chart is that it seems to provide clear advice on what actions you should take in your portfolio, at least according to the chart\u2019s measurements. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what the colors mean:\n\nRed: When the price of Bitcoin is in the red, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates a \u201cmaximum bubble territory.\u201d With that, it\u2019s a good time to sell Bitcoin but not to buy it.\n\nOrange: When the price of Bitcoin is in the orange, it\u2019s in the \u201cFOMO intensifies\u201d stage, which means that the price is relatively high. With that, it\u2019s a wise time to sell Bitcoin but not to buy it.\n\nYellow: When the price of Bitcoin is in the yellow, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates that the price is neither too high nor too low. With that, there\u2019s little advantage to either buying or selling the coin.\n\nLight green: When the price of Bitcoin is in the light green, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates that the price is on the low side. With that, there is potential for growth, making it a reasonably good time to buy but not sell.\n\nGreen: When the price of Bitcoin is in the green, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates that the price is on the low side. Since it is potentially undervalued, there is some potential room for growth, making it a reasonably good time to buy but not sell.\n\nBlue-green: When the price of Bitcoin is in the blue-green, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart indicates that the price is on the low side. With that, there is a lot of growth potential, making it a good time to stock up.\n\nIndigo: A price at the indigo level is about as good as it gets, otherwise known as a fire sale, making it a perfect time to buy Bitcoin.\n\nBy following the rainbow chart, it\u2019s easy to see where the price of Bitcoin stands based on the color.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart\n\nAs with all investment tools, using the rainbow chart has pros and cons.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pros:\n\nReasonably good track record: Since the chart launched in 2014, it has remained relatively accurate.\n\nEasy to use: It\u2019s easy to check in with the rainbow chart before buying or selling Bitcoin.\n\nNow for the cons:\n\nNot a foolproof result: Although the chart has been right so far, that doesn\u2019t mean it will always be a good judge of Bitcoin\u2019s price direction.\n\nDoesn\u2019t look at the daily fluctuations: If you want to buy and sell Bitcoin throughout the day, this chart won\u2019t be much help to you.\n\nShould You Rely on the Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a helpful visual to assess where the price of Bitcoin stands quickly. But long-term research has yet to back-up the chart. When dealing with highly volatile cryptocurrencies, things can change rapidly.\n\nSince past performance doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate future results, relying on the rainbow chart won\u2019t always translate into blockbuster investment returns. Solely relying on this chart could mislead your investment decisions if the price of Bitcoin behaves unexpectedly.\n\nThe rainbow chart might be a good place to start investment decision-making. But it\u2019s important to follow up on your initial discovery with other information about the state of the Bitcoin market before moving forward with an investment decision.\n\nHow to Invest in Cryptocurrency\n\nMost successful cryptocurrency investors regularly follow changes in the market to guide their decisions. Since the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, constant monitoring seems to be one path to success.\n\nHowever, only some investors interested in the cryptocurrency have the time or inclination to monitor the markets consistently. The good news is that with the spread of artificial intelligence, it\u2019s possible to find investing software that protects your money from volatility and price swings.\n\nAt the same time, nothing in the crypto space is guaranteed, and you shouldn\u2019t invest any money you need to survive. Multiple established crypto exchanges collapsed in 2022. Investors should be wary of any cryptocurrency that makes investors promises that seem too good to be true.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is one tool available to cryptocurrency investors. If you are trying to determine the right time to buy or sell Bitcoin, this tool can give you a quick take on the situation. However, it shouldn\u2019t be the only tool you use to determine the appropriate time to buy or sell Bitcoin.\n\nThe post What is a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart? appeared first on Due.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin price slips under $27K, but data shows BTC whales counter trading DXY strength - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "As the summer season arrives, an unexpected heatwave is gripping financial markets.\n\nThis heat is coming in the form of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which has been on a remarkable uptrend since late April, reaching levels unseen since early March\u2019s banking crisis when the dollar wrecking ball wreaked havoc on asset prices.\n\nThis surge in the dollar has raised concerns among market participants due to its high inverse relationship with Bitcoin (BTC), a topic many macro and crypto analysts have discussed repeatedly in 2023.\n\nThe implication of this inverse correlation means that when the dollar rises, BTC falls and vice versa. The chart below showing the year-to-date performances of DXY (blue line) and BTC (orange line) underscores this relationship a step further.\n\nNotice how Bitcoin\u2019s 2023\u2019s performance has been propelled by a downward dollar. Not coincidentally, the DXY reached its year-to-date low near 100.80 on April 13, nearly the exact date BTC reached its year-to-date high of just over $31,000. Since then, however, both have been trending in opposite directions.\n\nBTC and DXY year-to-date returns. Source: TradingView\n\nFeelings of unease over what sort of summer could be in store for markets should the dollar\u2019s uptrend continue are certainly justified at present. After all, the last time the DXY broke above these levels, BTC was trading below the $20,000 mark.\n\nOn the surface, this would imply that BTC still has quite a deep correction ahead before any hopes of new year-to-date highs emerge.\n\nTaking a look deeper, however, it\u2019s clear that some divergent signals are beginning to emerge that suggest this dollar rally could be nearing an end.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at them to see what\u2019s been driving DXY\u2019s recent strength and zoom in on a notable segment of the market that has remained unphased by Uncle Sam\u2019s recent resurgence.\n\nThe relationship between BTC and DXY is terminal\n\nBack in March, similar to now, plummeting federal funds futures were the primary driver of the DXY\u2019s strength.\n\nFor readers who might not be macroeconomic nerds, the federal funds futures represent the terminal rate, or the market\u2019s expectation of when the Federal Reserve\u2019s hiking cycle will come to an end.\n\nWhen Federal funds futures fall, the terminal rate rises, and consequently, the dollar rises as well. The opposite is also true, which is another inverse correlation.\n\nTo track this leading indicator, traders follow the federal funds futures ticker (ZQN2023 on TradingView). The chart can be a bit intricate, with 100 representing zero interest rate expectations and each 0.10 increment below indicating a 10 basis point (0.10%) rate hike.\n\nCurrently, the chart reads 94.83, implying a terminal rate of 5.27%. This suggests that the market still anticipates the Fed to hike rates by at least 27 basis points beyond its current rate of 5%.\n\nJuly 2023 federal funds futures contracts. Source: TradingView\n\nThis is the lowest level federal funds futures have reached since early March, just before the banking crisis unfolded.\n\nLooking at the chart again below with BTC (orange line) laid overtop shows that the mid-March reversal in terminal rate expectations was a huge driver of DXY\u2019s drop and, consequently, Bitcoin\u2019s rally above $30,000.\n\nBTC and July 2023 federal funds futures contracts. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the federal funds futures were again to fall back below the 94.50 level, as they did in March, it would become very likely that the market would fall back under heavy sell pressure due to this correlation.\n\nNotably, these federal funds futures made a strong surge on the afternoon of Wednesday, May 31, when they rose over 10 basis points from the lows.\n\nShould this trend continue and the ZQN2023 contract rise back above 95, it would signal the market\u2019s belief that the Fed\u2019s hiking cycle has concluded, potentially paving the way for rate cuts. Such easing of monetary policy would more than likely be quite bullish for BTC and bearish for the DXY.\n\nThis is especially true if the DXY falls back down to new 2023 lows from here and breaks below its long-held support level near 100. Such price action would open up the gates for BTC to make a refreshed run above $30,000.\n\nAnd with that thought in mind, there is one notable cohort of crypto market participants who appear to be front-running such a reversal: Bitcoin whales.\n\nRelated: Last BTC price dip before a $30K breakout? Bitcoin wipes weekend gains\n\nBitcoin whale songs\n\nBitcoin whales are classified by wallet addresses that hold more than 10,000 BTC.\n\nA species of smart money that the on-chain data scientists study intensely.\n\nAs shown on the chart below, Bitcoin whales (represented by the red dots) have been steadily increasing their holdings on net every day since April 17, a trend which coincided with Bitcoin reaching its year-to-date high above $31,000.\n\nBitcoin divergence chart. Source: Tara NFT\n\nThis behavior diverges from previous trends, where whale wallets accumulated Bitcoin at market bottoms, or on the way to higher highs, rather than tops. This anomaly prompts a thought-provoking question: Have these whale wallets bought the top for the first time, or was April 17 not the peak?\n\nBitcoin divergence chart. Source: Tara NFT\n\nThis behavior from the Bitcoin market\u2019s largest players calls into question the legitimacy of May\u2019s DXY pump and adds uncertainty to bearish outlooks, especially when combined with the notable rise in federal funds futures.\n\nAs always, the market is doing its best to keep participants a step behind the next trend.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is how much the rise of terminal rates and the DXY in May can be attributed to escalating fears over the United States debt ceiling standoff. With that issue now in the rearview (pending final votes), one wonders whether or not this will lead to the dollar reverting back to its downtrend and Bitcoin heading back above the $30,000 mark.\n\nFor the remainder of the second quarter, it will be crucial to closely monitor the movements of terminal rate expectations, the DXY and Bitcoin whale activity, as these data points are likely to provide actionable clues prior to the next big move happening.\n\nThe coming weeks will undoubtedly shed light on these intriguing dynamics, shaping the path for both the U.S. dollar and the cryptocurrency market at large into the summer months and beyond.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin fell below US$27,000 in Thursday afternoon trading in Asia. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also fell, but mostly posted weekly gains. Cardano was the day\u2019s biggest loser. Litecoin led daily gains with an increase of 3.42%, followed by Polygon that rose 0.08%.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong to be digital asset rules sandbox for China, says former city regulator\n\nBitcoin, Ether extend losses\n\nBitcoin fell 1.36% to US$26,805 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency strengthened 2.62% on the week.\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency, dropped 0.82% in 24 hours to US$1,854, but gained 4.3% in the last seven days.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA token fell the most in 24 hours, losing 3.13% to US$0.3641, while posting weekly gains of 2.05%.\n\nLitecoin and Polygon were the only gainers among top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos. Litecoin\u2019s LTC token climbed 3.42% to US$92.41, and posted weekly gains of 9.89%. Polygon\u2019s Matic token inched up 0.08% to US$0.89, after gaining 1.44% in the last seven days.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization dropped 0.92% to US$1.13 trillion, and the total crypto market volume declined 8.82% to US$31.77 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong is sending out positive vibes to the cryptocurrency industry with its aim to be a global crypto hub, and began its new licensing regime on June 1. Digital asset platform OSL said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it has applied for an \u201cuplift\u201d to its existing license with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong to facilitate retail trading.\n\nHashKey PRO, a Hong Kong SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platform, also announced on Thursday that it has applied for a license to offer crypto retail services in Hong Kong.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rise\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn non-fungible tokens, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.28% in the 24 hours to 8.20 p.m. in Hong Kong, but rose 1.56% in the last seven days. The Forkast ETH NFT Composite remained unchanged in 24 hours but gained 0.2% on the week.\n\nOver the same period, Ethereum NFT sales gained 39.94% to US$26.25 million, according to CryptoSlam data. Bored Ape Yacht Club recorded the highest sales volume among NFTs in the Ethereum blockchain, rising 3.99% to US$6.29 million.\n\nNFT sales on the Bitcoin network dropped 53.3% in 24 hours to US$2.23 million. Sales of $OXBT BRC-20 NFTs, a Bitcoin Ordinals collection with the highest sales volume, declined 48.49% to US$508,828.\n\n\u201cBitcoin continues to fall from its previous seven-day highs, but other ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum are on the upswing. I expect this tug-of-war to continue until new users come into the space, and bring liquidity to be able to push both up at the same time,\u201d according to Yehudah Petscher, an NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nAsian equity mixed, U.S. futures rise\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equity markets traded mixed on Thursday after China\u2019s official Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) showed manufacturing activity in May shrank for a second consecutive month, muting investor enthusiasm about an economic recovery in the world\u2019s second biggest economy.\n\nThe Shenzhen Component Index lost 0.39% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index fell 0.1%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained 0.84%.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures rose as of 6.40 p.m. in Hong Kong. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.17%, the S&P 500 futures index gained 0.28% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched up 0.1%.\n\nThe gains come amid cautious optimism after the U.S. House of Representatives approved a debt ceiling and budget cut package, avoiding a default crisis.\n\nEuropean bourses gained on Thursday after data showed that inflation in the euro zone eased more than expected in May, with annual inflation falling to 6.1%, lower than an expected 6.3% and down from 7% in April.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.77% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 gained 1.12%.\n\n\u201cWhile economic conditions have improved slightly, uncertain growth prospects paired with persistent inflation and tightening financing conditions continue to weigh on the balance sheets of firms, households and governments,\u201d the European Central Bank said in its Financial Stability Review report on May 31."

        "title": "Hong Kong is bringing back retail crypto trading. Will China be next? - Fortune",
        "content": "Hong Kong on Thursday reinstated retail crypto trading at select exchanges in what could serve as a test case for China reversing its 2021 ban on cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile crypto trading and mining are still banned on the mainland, Hong Kong, which is a special administrative region of China, has cautiously reopened to the nascent asset class.\n\nLast week, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission announced it was going forward with a plan to allow individual investors to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with high market caps, like Bitcoin and Ether, as it begins a new licensing system June 1. As of Thursday, it will be against the law for any unlicensed exchanges to market to Hong Kong investors, Bloomberg reported, citing Keith Choy, the interim head of intermediaries at the SFC.\n\nJust two exchanges, OSL Digital Securities Limited and Hash Blockchain Limited, have been licensed so far, according to the SFC\u2019s website, but several others, including Huobi and OKX, have said they plan to apply for licenses.\n\nOver the weekend, Beijing added to the speculation of a crypto renaissance in the country after the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission and the Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park Management Committee released a white paper on Web3 technologies, according to local media. The report seemed to affirm at least some commitment to supporting blockchain-related companies ahead of the implementation of Hong Kong\u2019s new policy. Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, CEO of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, posted a copy of the white paper on Twitter, noting the \u201cinteresting timing.\u201d\n\nInteresting timing on this Web 3.0 white paper from the Beijing government tech committee with the June 1st anticipation in Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/0Ts1UB0jnL \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) May 27, 2023\n\nAnd on Monday, two new Hong Kong\u2013based industry associations, Hong Kong Licensed Virtual Assets Association and Web3 Harbour, also launched with \u201ca shared commitment to the long-term growth and development of the virtual asset economy and decentralized internet,\u201d according to a press release.\n\nThe shift in Hong Kong\u2019s attitude toward digital currencies follows similar actions by governments in Dubai and Singapore. But Hong Kong\u2019s new approach could have a bigger impact, experts say, because of the potential for China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, to embrace crypto as the U.S. grows increasingly hostile toward the sector.\n\n\u201cI have literally been laughed at when I tell people that our business is in the U.S.\u201d Leo Mizuhara, CEO, Hashnote\n\nMark Connors, head of research at 3iQ, said China is likely being pulled toward crypto rather than pushing on its own, because it needs new revenue streams to help service its debts. Reopening to crypto trading would give it that opportunity, but it would also increase the overall variability and volatility because more retail traders mean more liquidity, he said.\n\nHe added that China, which is known for tight controls over its economy, might introduce its own crypto exchange, which, although unusual, could still be a net positive.\n\n\u201cEven if it was state-controlled,\u201d Connors added, \u201cyou would have a liquidity provider for the world\u2019s largest populated state.\u201d\n\nHow China\u2019s government will coexist with decentralized blockchains remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThis is almost an exercise in democracy,\u201d Connors continued, \u201cwhere you have a non-state commodity being shared, and you can\u2019t really control its flow like you can with pipelines and shipping lanes.\u201d\n\nThe change in tone from Hong Kong is welcome news to entrepreneurs and business leaders who are interested in getting a foothold in China. Leo Mizuhara, CEO of Hashnote, an institutional management platform for digital assets, said he has looked to expand his company\u2019s reach in Asia partly because of the large market opportunity but also because of U.S. regulators\u2019 increasing hostility.\n\nEven though Mizuhara said he worries about the risks of doing business in China, such as submitting to strict capital controls or ceding some of the company\u2019s intellectual property to the government, he\u2019ll still strongly consider it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to run a business with the level of uncertainty that is currently in the U.S.,\u201d Mizuhara said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost irresponsible of us not to have a little bit of that diversification.\u201d\n\nIncreased enforcement actions by regulators, mainly the Securities and Exchange Commission, have left crypto companies unsure of where they stand, even those offering an olive branch to regulators. Coinbase, the biggest U.S.-based exchange and arguably one of the most compliant companies in the industry, sued the SEC in April after it was hit with a Wells Notice, which signals the agency is planning legal action against an individual or company.\n\nIn a MarketWatch opinion piece published on Wednesday by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, he said regulators and policymakers writing off crypto as just another unstable asset benefits China and it \u201crisks America\u2019s time-honored role as the global financial leader and an innovation hub.\u201d\n\nAlthough most of Hashnote\u2019s employees are split between Chicago and New York City, Mizuhara said he\u2019s considering moving the company\u2019s headquarters to another country.\n\n\u201cI have literally been laughed at when I tell people that our business is in the U.S.,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Bitcoin likely to remain in red through the next quarter if history is any indication - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price ended its four-month positive return streak as May noted a negative return of 6.92%.\n\nHistorical monthly return suggests that BTC is likely to remain in the red for the next quarter as well.\n\nBased on this data, investors can expect the bull run to restart in October 2023.\n\nWith worsening macroeconomic conditions, this bearish outlook might just manifest.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price produced a monthly close at $27,210, noting a -6.92% return for May. The last-minute slide in BTC put an end to the four-month bullish streak that kickstarted the 2023 rally.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC delays inevitable crash to $25,000\n\nBitcoin price and historical returns\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price faced intense selling pressure in May, which caused it to drop 8.75% from its local top of $29,820. As a result, the month returned a negative 6.92%, ending the four-month positive streak for BTC.\n\nAs hopes of a bull run diminish, more investors could join the selling spree, triggering a sell-off. Or, Bitcoin price could consolidate, making it boring for day traders and investors. Historical data is key when measured over a large enough timeframe and reflects investors\u2019 sentiments, which often tend to be cyclical.\n\nOver the last 14 years, the highest average return for Bitcoin price is roughly 38% in November. Following this is 36% in April and 26% in October. Likewise, quarters one and four display the best returns for Bitcoin price. A simple conclusion from this would be that the first and third quarters are typically the best time to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC average monthly and quarterly returns\n\nThe monthly return table for Bitcoin price not only shows the big-picture outlook but also adds structure to the chaos of everyday volatility. As seen in the image below, the average return for BTC slumps after April all the way up to September. But in the last quarter, the average monthly return picks up steam.\n\nA simple conclusion one can draw from this is that the next three months are likely going to be in the red or barely breaking even. The former seems more plausible when factoring in the worsening macroeconomic conditions.\n\nBTC monthly returns\n\nRead more: China coin narrative in play as Coinbase CEO warns of restrictive US crypto policies\n\nMacroeconomic economic conditions worsen\n\nIn hindsight, Covid-19 seems to be the starting point of what is happening in the world. Due to the sudden halt in the economic machine, central banks across the world started worrying about an impending recession. To prevent a catastrophic breakdown of world economies, central banks decided to grease the economy by printing and distributing money to failing banks, businesses and people.\n\nWhile money printing did the trick, it took a heavy toll on inflation. The year-over-year Consumer Price Index (CPI), or inflation in the United States, peaked at 9.1% in 2022. Similar ripple effects were seen in economies across the world that resorted to printing money out of thin air.\n\nCentral banks have been trying to curb the inflation. The US Federal Reserve has been curbing inflation by raising interest rates, which is reminiscent of the Great Recession of 2008 - 2009. Similar hikes in interest rates in 2008 caused the banks to fail, which had a domino effect causing the housing market bubble to pop. The panic was soon followed by a recession in not just the US but across the globe.\n\nLikewise, the recent hikes by the Fed caused many popular US banks to close up shops, which caused panic among retail investors. Now, the latest in a long line of crisis is the US Debt Ceiling; the US House of Representatives has voted to remove the $31.4 trillion ceiling, which received bipartisan support.\n\nRead more: S&P500 Futures grind higher, yields stabilize as US House of Representatives pass debt ceiling deal\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nBased on the historical data and macroeconomic conditions, the outlook for Bitcoin price does not look good. So, investors can expect the next three months to be so-so. But from a long-term investment perspective, Q3 is likely to provide plenty of opportunities to accumulate BTC and other altcoins before the 2023 bull rally kickstarts in Q4."

        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto may have effectively disappeared over 12 years ago, but two artificial intelligence dabblers are seeking to revive the ability to chat with the famed Bitcoin (BTC) creator.\n\nOn May 31, Bitcoin FilmFest co-organizer Pierre Corbin and co-developer Hugo Ferrer released \u201cTalk2Satoshi,\u201d an AI chatbot that aims to answer questions about Bitcoin and economics as if they came from Nakamoto.\n\nAnnouncing my newest project!\n\n\n\nTogether with @HugoFerrer_, we've spent the last few weeks working on something that has been missing in #bitcoin: the Bitcoin GPT. We call it @talk2satoshi .\n\n\n\nTry it out for free: https://t.co/IhWIVAZSsT https://t.co/AFQlb9Dxc9 \u2014 Pierre Corbin (@CierrePorbin) May 31, 2023\n\nThe model, essentially, is OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT trained on a limited data set, including Nakamoto\u2019s public emails and forum posts. It also draws from other sources, including Saifedean Ammous\u2019 book The Bitcoin Standard, Jeff Booth\u2019s book The Price of Tomorrow and Corbin\u2019s film The Great Reset and the Rise of Bitcoin, with more sources on the way.\n\nIn testing, the chatbot generates responses that are typically uncertain of the future of fiat currencies and hopeful about Bitcoin, although it can provide conflicting answers depending on how it's prompted.\n\nCheck out an example:\n\nHere's the answer to \"Is our debt sustainable in an inflationary world?\":\n\n\n\nWhere else can you get this kind of answer? pic.twitter.com/euSj6oXqot \u2014 Pierre Corbin (@CierrePorbin) May 31, 2023\n\nFor example, when asked a variation of the question \u201cWhat is the future of Bitcoin?\u201d it generated separate responses saying it was both \u201cpromising\u201d and \u201cuncertain.\u201d\n\nThe model isn\u2019t trained on the more recent Bitcoin developments, such as the Ordinals protocol or BRC-20 tokens and often generates a response saying it can\u2019t provide an opinion on such topics. Depending on the question, however, it can generate contradicting responses on Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nThe chatbot seems to be critical of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and other Bitcoin forks in general, saying it has been \u201cdifficult for alternative chains to gain momentum.\" Source: Talk2Satoshi\n\nWhen asked questions regarding Ordinals, it said in one reply that Bitcoin \u201cis not meant to be a platform for storing or transmitting images or other types of data,\u201d while another response called Ordinals \u201ca fascinating and creative application of cryptography.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin fragments could become more valuable than full Bitcoins\n\nAccording to Corbin, the goal of the bot is to show that AI tools could potentially be used in education.\n\nThe model can generate competent responses when asked questions about Bitcoin such as how it works and how its mined, and can explain aspects of the network such as satoshis.\n\nSimilar to the real person, the Nakamoto-emulating bot is still shy about revealing its real identity and typically responds:\n\n\u201cMy real name is not important. What is important is the decentralization of power that Bitcoin represents and the potential it has to revolutionize financial systems.\u201d\n\nMagazine: \u2018Moral responsibility\u2019 \u2014 Can blockchain really improve trust in AI?"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market experienced a dull month, with Bitcoin (BTC) dropping 7.37% \u2014 its worst performance since November 2022 \u2014 and Ether (ETH) losing 0.22% in May.\n\nThe average loss across the market stands at 5.62% on the last day before the monthly close.\n\nHowever, some outliers posted impressive gains thanks to popular investment narratives and the growth of the Ethereum staking sector.\n\nIn the first half of May, memecoins grabbed headlines, with Pepecoin (PEPE) leading the narrative. The memecoin cycle guzzled up a lot of gas on Ethereum in the first half of May.\n\nPEPE\u2019s market capitalization surged to a peak of $1.54 billion in the first week of May, according to CoinGecko. It has witnessed a sell-off since then, as tokenholders booked profit. However, the token still ended the month with over 300% gains.\n\nTop 5 performers among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nKava price analysis\n\nThe positive catalyst that propelled the Kava (KAVA) price came from a mainnet upgrade on May 17. KAVA\u2019s price started surging a week before the update, which enhanced the blockchain\u2019s throughput and security.\n\nKAVA also got a boost from tokenholders\u2019 suggestions to terminate the project\u2019s grants and rewards programs by the end of 2023.\n\nTechnically, the KAVA/USDT pair faces resistance from the long-term support and resistance level at $1.14. A successful breakout above this level will motivate buyers to push KAVA toward $1.50. Support from buyers to the downside lies at $0.96 and $0.80.\n\nKAVA/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nXRP (XRP) posted a 7.29% gain over the month, with most of its price surge coming in the last few days.\n\nThe token recorded a spike in its daily transfer activity, which usually precedes a positive rally. Traders piled in with buy orders after on-chain analytics firm Santiment reported the activity on Twitter.\n\nAccording to popular opinion, Ripple, the fintech company behind the XRP token, is close to winning its securities case against the Securities and Exchange Commission. The verdict could come as early as June.\n\nTechnically, XRP faces resistance from the October 2022 and 2023 yearly peak levels of around $0.54. A successful breakout above this level can propel the price to the 2022 breakdown level of around $0.79.\n\nXRP/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTron price analysis\n\nTron (TRX), a layer-1 blockchain platform, has gained popularity in the last few weeks, as reports around its usage in market-making on centralized exchanges and the network\u2019s revenue made headlines.\n\nWhile Tron\u2019s decentralized finance usage is limited, it is the leading blockchain platform for Tether (USDT) issuance. The amount of USDT on Tron is $40 billion and surpasses the stablecoin\u2019s supply on Ethereum by $10 billion, according to Coin Metrics\u2019 supply data.\n\nKaiko, a crypto research firm, cited that the reason for Tron\u2019s dominance could be low fees, which makes transactions cheaper for market makers on centralized exchanges.\n\nThe stablecoin transfers led to a spike in Tron fees to make it the second-highest revenue-generating blockchain after Ethereum, per Token Terminal data.\n\nThe TRX/USD pair has a bullish breakout from an ascending triangle pattern with a target of $0.112. Before the pattern\u2019s bullish target is reached, buyers will face resistance at the 2022 high level of around $0.093.\n\nTRX/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nRocket Pool price analysis\n\nRocket Pool is the second most popular decentralized liquid staking derivative platform after Lido. It commands a 3% market share of the total Ethereum staking pool and has grown twofold in the last six months, according to Dune data from Hildobby.\n\nTop Ethereum liquid staking platforms. Source: Dune\n\nThe daily chart of the RPL/USD pair looks bullish, with RPL forming a trend of higher lows restricted by the horizontal resistance at $52. If buyers conquer this resistance level, RPL can witness a 60% upside target based on the ascending triangle pattern.\n\nThe all-time high for the token is $61.90, per CoinGecko data. A price breakout above this level would technically put the token into price discovery mode without any resistance to the upside.\n\nOn the other hand, sellers will target local lows of $45.57 and $37.95 in case of correction.\n\nRelated: What are artificial intelligence (AI) crypto coins, and how do they work?\n\nRender Token price analysis\n\nRender Token (RNDR) benefited from the recent artificial intelligence (AI) hype that has culminated in an uptick in companies requiring graphics cards for training AI models.\n\nRNDR is an ERC-20 utility token that powers Render Network, a protocol that provides a decentralized marketplace for graphics processing unit (GPU) power. Using RNDR as the medium of exchange, Render Network connects users looking to rent the processing power with those who have idle GPUs.\n\nRNDR has added 5.5% gains in May, rallying strongly in the second half of the month. Data from Nansen shows that the smart token holding for RNDR has reduced since the start of this year. Nevertheless, the number of unique smart wallets holding RNDR has increased linearly during the same period.\n\nThe number of smart money wallets holding RNDR and the total balances. Source: Nansen\n\nThe RNDR/USD pair has exhibited significant volatility around the resistance and support level of $2.13. If buyers build support above it, the token could enter a crucial pivotal parallel range between $3.19 and $2.13.\n\nThere is minimal resistance above $3.19, with the potential to touch 2022 highs of $5.29. To the downside, buyers may find support around local lows at $1.62 and $0.90.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Wednesday afternoon trading hours in Hong Kong, along with the majority of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Bitcoin recorded the day\u2019s largest loss, followed by Litecoin. XRP stood out as the sole gainer.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin weighed down by debt ceiling uncertainty\n\nBitcoin, Ether down, along with all cryptos except XRP\n\nBitcoin fell 1.81% from 10:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$27,163. The afternoon slump positioned the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency as the greatest loser among the top 10 cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours, experiencing a 2.31% loss. Litecoin followed closely, falling 2.27% to US$89.51.\n\n\u201cBitcoin needs to overcome the US$28,000 big figure. It\u2019s weekly candle has to close above US$28,000 to be bullish,\u201d said Johnny Louey, a crypto research analyst at trading platform LiquidityTech Protocol.\n\nEther fell 1.31% to US$1,870 since 10:00 am, falling under the psychological benchmark of US$1,900.\n\nXRP was the only token in the green among the top 10 cryptos, rising 0.91% to US$0.5074 after leading yesterday\u2019s gains. The coin started picking up momentum after pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton tweeted on Sunday, that the court will make public internal documents from 2018 showing former Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman saying sales of Ether tokens were not securities transactions, which could undermine the regulator\u2019s case against Ripple Labs. The U.S. securities watchdog sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in December 2020, claiming that XRP was a security and that Ripple had conducted unregistered securities transactions by selling the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin, Ether NFT sales up\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index inched up 0.02% to 3,412.59 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong while rising 1.0% during the week.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin\u2019s secondary non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose 5.42% to US$4.6 million in the past 24 hours. Interest in Bitcoin NFTs is surging, after the new BRC-721E token standard was launched on Monday. The token standard allow Ethereum-native ERC-721 NFTs to be permanently transferred to Bitcoin, where they become BRC-721E tokens.\n\nThe launch of the new Bitcoin-based token standard has pushed the Milday Maker NFT collection to the top 10 for daily sales. Originally founded on Ethereum, Miladay Maker participated in the creation of the BRC-721E token standard.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 10.25% to US$19.1 million, boosted by Bored Ape Yacht Club, which rose 1.32%, generating US$2.6 million in sales for the network. Sales for Opepen Edition NFTs also rose 79.15% to US$868,963.\n\nAmong Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast CAR NFT Composite was the only one to decrease, falling 2.07% to 1,019.54 points. Cardano\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 12.47% to US$385,305, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nAsian Equities, U.S. stock futures down, ahead of debt ceiling updates\n\nThe committee approved the bipartisan deal with a narrow 7-6 vote, where it faced opposition from two Republicans and four Democrats. Image:Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nAsian equities weakened during Wednesday afternoon trading, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index falling 1.94% near its six-month low. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 experienced a 1.41% decrease, while the Shanghai Composite inched down 0.61% and the Shenzhen Component Index dipped 0.70%.\n\nConcerns over China\u2019s economic recovery impacted investor sentiment, as the country\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to a five-month low in May. The data suggests that factory activity contracted more rapidly than anticipated due to diminishing demand, leading to the offshore yuan depreciating to US$7.12 per dollar, its lowest value in six months.\n\nU.S. stock futures were also red as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, as investors awaited updates on the U.S. debt ceiling deal. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.15%, the S&P 500 futures index inched down 0.18%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures weakened by 0.18%.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached a preliminary deal on Sunday, that would suspend the debt ceiling until after the presidential election in 2024. While the bill passed through the House rules committee by a 7-6 margin on Tuesday, it still needs approval from the full House, which is set to vote on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department moved the date at which the U.S. would reach its borrowing limit to June 5.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index rose 0.33% to 104.5 points on Wednesday, on track for a monthly gain of nearly 3%. Meanwhile, the euro fell 0.53% to US$1.06, its lowest since March 17.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong Solidifies Crypto Regulations even as Malaysia bears down on Huobi\n\n(Update edits headline, adds equity and NFT sections)"

        "content": "Change is in the air. Crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT) have been in a pretty brutal bear market for almost exactly a year now, which many, myself included, had projected to last for years.\n\nBut now, there are signs of life springing up all around, being driven by Bitcoin NFTs, and recent news of China opening the door for citizens to engage the blockchain again. The bear market may be over sooner than we had thought, so let\u2019s get into what\u2019s making me think that NFTs might just be back.\n\nNoteworthy Happenings\n\nChina is coming into NFTs and crypto, and Russia will use crypto to settle payments across borders. These two major announcements are bringing excitement back to the NFT and crypto markets and lead many to believe that these alone can turn the market around.\n\nCollectors are eying high-priced NFTs ahead of a potential incoming pump from Chinese investors looking to snatch NFT grails like CryptoPunks, BAYC and Azuki. An x-factor that not enough people are talking about yet is, what if they decided to dive into the mostly unexplored world of Bitcoin NFTs where opportunities may be even greater than the already expensive Ethereum ecosystem?\n\nBitcoin NFTs are really starting to cook, and just yesterday the 10 millionth Ordinal was inscribed . This massive milestone many thought improbable just a few months ago, but believers in Bitcoin NFTs never had a doubt. At this point, no one can deny that Bitcoin\u2019s NFTs are here to stay, but the question of \u2018Will Bitcoin NFTs flip Ethereum NFTs?\u2019 is another story. I think they will.\n\nA new token standard was created on Bitcoin yesterday called BRC-721E . This will let traders bridge their Ethereum NFT over to Bitcoin by \u201cburning\u201d the Ethereum NFT and re-creating it on Bitcoin. Now we\u2019ll get to see traders\u2019 convictions on the Bitcoin ecosystem play out in real time.\n\nA new meta is emerging in NFTs which is to drop a new cryptocurrency (an ERC-20 or BRC-20 token) and then build an ecosystem around it, likely with NFTs. $OXBT is the new hottest BRC-20 collection on Bitcoin, and there are teases of upcoming utility for this token. Fun fact , $OXBT is now held by more wallets than any other individual digital asset on the Bitcoin blockchain other than BTC itself and its smaller denomination, Satoshis.\n\nThis hot new meta recently took off with new meme coins like $PEPE, $TURBO, $BEN, and $PSYOP looking for ways to drive more users to the token, and the concept now seems destined to shape the NFT scene for the foreseeable future.\n\nGaming on the cusp of taking over Web3\n\nGaming is on the cusp of taking over Web3. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, now has over 20 blockchain games listed on their store with some like Defimons now entering a closed beta.\n\nIf Mythos Chain\u2019s DMarket, and ImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained are any indication of what\u2019s to come (they are), we\u2019re in for a meteoric rise in NFT adoption. Just look at how the buyers/sellers and transactions compare to a typical PFP project.\n\n\n\nSales from these two projects have propelled them into the top five for the past seven days, foreshadowing what\u2019s to come as blockchain games begin to enter the mainstream.\n\nPeep the charts\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m fascinated to see who Bitcoin\u2019s growth impacts more, Ethereum and its layer 2s, or Solana? Take notice of which chains aren\u2019t in the top 10 NFT Collection Rankings by Sales Volume for the past 7 days, and you\u2019ll see who it may be.\n\nNakamigos have had a sudden surge, as have Jack Butchers\u2019 art project Openens, pushing both ahead of Milady Maker and into the Top 10. Milady Maker continues to hang around with the big dogs, now with extra action that revolves around the new BRC-721E bridge that originated in the Milady project.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin continues to fall from its previous seven-day highs, but other ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum are on the upswing. I expect this tug-of-war to continue until new users come into the space, and bring liquidity to be able to push both up at the same time.\n\n(Disclosure: The author of this commentary holds $OXBT)"

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst believes the price action of Bitcoin (BTC) could take off within months if two key indicators cross.\n\nIn a new update, the anonymous host of InvestAnswers tells his 444,000 YouTube subscribers that when the 50-week moving average retakes the 200-week moving average Bitcoin will likely soar.\n\nIn technical analysis, this is known as a golden cross, which occurs when a short-term moving average rises above a long-term moving average. A golden cross, which is the opposite of a death cross, indicates the start of a sustained uptrend.\n\nThe crypto analyst believes that the golden cross will occur sometime in August.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s important about this is when we cross the 200-week over with the 50-week, and never before \u2013 we came close late 2015 \u2013 but never before have we actually pierced the 200-week moving average in red with the green line, which is the 50-week moving average.\n\nSo this one we went through, and that is a death cross. Now, what\u2019s interesting and we\u2019ve talked about this before, the death cross doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the market goes down. So you can see when this death cross actually happened the market fell but only for a few days and then it bounced right back up again. It\u2019s been crazy.\n\nBut right now\u2026 sometime August 2023, that green will pierce the red and that means, typically 65% to 70% of the time, when we get a gold cross, the short-term crossing the longer-term line, we will go bonkers. So that could be good. And you know, August is normally a quiet time in the market, low volume, participants are elsewhere at the beach or whatever, but this could be another catalyst that we\u2019re looking at as we go forward.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading for $27,025 at time of writing, down 3% during the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Stablecoin issuer Tether has made a groundbreaking move in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nTether has just announced the launch of Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay.\n\nTether has aimed to minimize the environmental impact associated with Bitcoin mining.\n\nTether, the prominent stablecoin issuer, has made an exciting revelation. They have unveiled their intention to venture into the realm of Bitcoin mining, and the chosen destination for this endeavor is none other than Uruguay, a country nestled in South America.\n\nTether to Invest in Uruguay\u2019s Energy Production\n\nIn their recent announcement on May 30, Tether declared their plans to establish a mining division in Uruguay through a collaboration with a local licensed company. Moreover, Tether will invest in the energy production sector of Uruguay, solidifying its commitment to the nation.\n\nBy incorporating renewable energy sources into their mining operations, Tether aims to achieve a sustainable approach that minimizes the ecological impact typically associated with Bitcoin mining. Additionally, Tether intends to expand its team by recruiting more professionals in this domain.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, the Chief Technology Officer of Tether, emphasized the significance of this initiative, stating:\n\nBy leveraging the power of Bitcoin alongside Uruguay's renewable energy capabilities, Tether is at the forefront of sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining. Our unwavering dedication to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves behind only a negligible ecological footprint, all while upholding the utmost security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.\"\n\nAt Tether, we understand the importance of energy in driving progress & enabling thriving communities. That's why we're dedicated to harnessing the power of renewable energy to mine #Bitcoin, the world's most open & secure monetary network.\n\n\n\nLearn More \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/LmBQptyobi pic.twitter.com/VrG20OnE1Z \u2014 Tether (@Tether_to) May 30, 2023\n\nUruguay Boasts 94% Renewable Energy, Ideal for Tether\n\nUruguay boasts an impressive track record in generating electricity from renewable sources, with a staggering 94% of its power derived from wind, solar, and potentially even hydropower.\n\nCoupled with a reliable grid infrastructure, these factors make Uruguay an ideal location for Tether\u2019s mining operations. Job listings found on Tether\u2019s website further hinted at the possibility of future expansions into South Africa and Brazil.\n\nTether to Allocate 15% Profits for Bitcoin Purchases\n\nThe announcement of Tether\u2019s foray into mining follows their recent statement regarding their intention to allocate a portion of their profits, up to 15%, for Bitcoin purchases.\n\nAs of the first quarter of 2023, Tether held approximately $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, constituting 2% of their total reserves. However, the bulk of their holdings primarily consisted of cash, cash equivalents, and United States Treasury bills.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIt remains to be seen how Tether\u2019s entry into Bitcoin mining will impact the broader mining ecosystem and the competitive landscape.\n\nTether\u2019s allocation of profits for Bitcoin purchases may have implications for the stability of the stablecoin itself, as it could expose the company to the volatility and risks associated with cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nTether\u2019s choice of Uruguay as a location for its mining operations calls into question this decision\u2019s motivations and potential regulatory implications.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nTether\u2019s entry into Bitcoin mining, alongside its focus on utilizing renewable energy sources, signifies a significant step toward sustainable and responsible practices in the crypto industry.\n\nBy harnessing the power of Bitcoin and partnering with Uruguay\u2019s renewable energy capabilities, Tether sets an example for others, showcasing the potential for environmentally conscious mining operations.\n\nTo learn more about Circle\u2019s emphasis on cross-border transactions with Euro Coin, read here:\n\nCircle Emphasizes Cross-Border Focus with New Euro Coin\n\nTo stay updated on the latest trends in the stablecoin market and its 14th consecutive month of slumping, check out:\n\nStablecoin Market Slumps for 14th Consecutive Month"

        "content": "In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, new concepts and trends are continuously emerging, piquing the curiosity of both investors and crypto enthusiasts. One aspect attracting attention is the meteoric rise of cryptocurrency itself, particularly meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), and the eagerly anticipated Big Eyes Coin (BIG). The cryptocurrency community is now experiencing a level of excitement that has never been seen before.\n\nUnveiling The Cryptic Chessboard: Bitcoin\u2019s Fate Hangs In The Balance\n\nBitcoin markets showed modest gains as traders sought stability above $28,000, reaching a two-week high of over $28,450. Short-term profit-taking sentiment pushed the price lower to around $27,850. However, Bitcoin remained up about 10% from its recent low of $26,000 on May 25. The gains were fueled by optimism around the U.S. averting a default after an agreement to raise borrowing limits. The weakened U.S. dollar contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s rise, with a potential rally to $31,000 in June, representing a 10% increase from current levels.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s Checkmate study highlights the significant impact of short-term holders (STH) on Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory. Metrics like STH-MVRV, STH-SOPR, and profit/loss ratios are closely monitored. Inactive holders hinder price objectives, while active participation inspires confidence. STH\u2019s actions carry substantial influence, shaping the market. Analysts track these metrics diligently, expecting retracements in the 2023 bull market. Bitcoin bulls must showcase unwavering dedication to price increases. Ultimately, market players collectively shape Bitcoin\u2019s path forward.\n\nDogecoin\u2019s Meme Magic: From Viral Phenomenon To Bullish Potential\n\nThe original meme coin, Dogecoin, captivated the crypto community with its appeal to online culture and celebrity endorsements. It swiftly garnered popularity and a devoted group after being influenced by the well-known Doge meme. Dogecoin gained acceptance as a payment option on websites like Reddit and Twitch despite having little practical purpose.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen examining its recent activity, Dogecoin made a breakout from a bullish falling wedge but then retracted. A double-bottom pattern with significant buying pressure, however, formed and suggested probable bullishness. A positive short-term prognosis is further supported by the wave count and RSI readings. Fibonacci retracement levels indicate that $0.087 to $0.091 could act as resistance during a pullback. However, a price decline below $0.069 would continue the bearish trend and can result in a price of $0.050.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Weaving Utility To Meme Coins\n\nBe prepared for an exciting show as Kitty Cuddlers gets ready for the highly anticipated Big Eyes Coin presale finale on June 3. As a result of the brave foray into the world of online casinos and P2E adventures that have enchanted the public, hearts are racing in anticipation of the grand launch on June 15, 2023. A gripping shift is coming for BIG with the thrilling return of the Stage 3 price of $0.00017. Everyone will be on the edge of their seats as a result of the frenzy of interest and anticipation this comeback will generate.\n\nThe ERC-20 cryptocurrency Big Eyes Coin emerges as a pioneer in the decentralized exchange (DEX) industry with its ground-breaking platform, BIG Swap. Prepare yourself for a tsunami of excitement. From the beginning, this innovative company has enchanted its customers with unique products like the captivating BIG Loot Box Trading Cards and alluring promo codes that promise a plethora of advantages. The meme coin has accomplished a great deal by raising an incredible $46 million during its initial coin offering (ICO) and is currently just $5.5 million away from meeting its audacious $51.5 million hard ceiling. The story of BIG has never ceased to enthrall and astound, igniting the passion of both investors and enthusiasts.\n\nBIG has established a vibrant, adorable community. BIG was able to successfully establish itself in the midst of the glut of Doge-themed meme coins, demonstrating to the world that we could carve out a unique niche for ourselves without following the crowd. Additionally, BIG has created its very own online BIG casino, which will exclusively benefit our devoted BIG holders.\n\nBig Eyes Coin will also grow to be a top Play-to-Earn project in the web3 and cryptocurrency sectors! In light of all of this, the moment has come to take advantage of this presale! There is no turning back now that $BIG could sell out at any second! Buy Big Eyes Coin immediately because once $BIG is gone, these low prices are never coming again!\n\nThe Final Say\n\nThe fate of Bitcoin remains uncertain, influenced by short-term holders and market dynamics. Dogecoin shows bullish potential, while Big Eyes Coin\u2019s presale finale sparks excitement in the decentralized exchange industry. The crypto world is brimming with anticipation and opportunity.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG) at:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/BigEyesCoin/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin"

        "content": "With less than one year left before the next Bitcoin (BTC) halving, when the current reward for mining the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset further cuts in half, historical chart patterns indicate optimism could be in order for Bitcoin investors.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin has gone through a halving event three times in its history \u2013 in November 2012, July 2016, and May 2020, and price increases have accompanied each of them, according to the data shared by cryptocurrency expert Trader Tardigrade on May 31.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has entered the final phase before the next halving. This phase is \u2018UP-ONLY\u2019 phase, which was test 3 times in $BTC history.\u201d\n\nHalving patterns\n\nIndeed, steady price climbs have both preceded and followed previous Bitcoin halvings, with the exception of a brief decline in 2020 caused by the Covid-19 pandemic but a recovery later on. If history repeats itself this time around, the analyst expects a price of about $50,000 around the halving event itself.\n\nAfter the halving, the maiden crypto asset should proceed with a further upward continuation in the following years, potentially even reaching the price of $200,000 in 2025, as the expert\u2019s chart analysis indicates.\n\nBitcoin chart pattern around halvings.

Source: Delphi Digital\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is currently changing hands at the price of $26,967, recording a decline of 2.67% in the last 24 hours and 5.48% over the previous 30 days but still demonstrating a 2.05% increase on its weekly chart, as the recent data shows.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin mining pools are groups of Bitcoin miners who join forces to combine their computing power and increase their chances of successfully mining Bitcoin. In the Bitcoin network, miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate and add new transactions to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins for their efforts.\n\nMining pools allow individuals who do solo mining to pool their resources and work together as a team. When a pool member successfully mines a block, the reward is distributed among the participants based on their contribution to the mining process. By joining a mining pool, miners can receive more frequent and consistent payouts compared to mining individually, where the probability of mining a block is lower due to the increased competition.\n\nBitcoin Mining pool typically uses a reward distribution method called \u201cproportional\u201d or \u201cpay-per-share.\u201d In proportional mining, the reward is divided among participants based on the number of shares they contributed to finding a block. Pay-per-share (PPS) pools offer a fixed payout for each share submitted by miners, regardless of whether a block is found. This provides a stable income for miners but may have higher fees compared to proportional pools.\n\nOverall, mining pools are a collaborative approach to Bitcoin mining, allowing miners to combine their computational resources and increase their chances of earning Bitcoin rewards.\n\nUnderstanding the Mechanisms of Pool Reward Splitting\n\nIt\u2019s important to comprehend shares before talking about the mining pools\u2019 reward schemes.\n\nBy using shares, pool owners can determine each miner\u2019s contribution to the pool. Shares are allotted to miners in proportion to their contribution to the pool as a whole.\n\nMiners can receive compensation from the pool through shares based on their contribution. Be aware that shares are undetectable. They are essentially merely phrases that pool managers use to decide how much to pay pool participants; they have no practical worth.\n\nAccepted shares and rejected shares are two categories for shares. Accepted shares are contributions made to a pool round. A miner\u2019s payback increases with the number of shares they give throughout a round. Shares that have been rejected are works that don\u2019t help uncover new cryptocurrencies. They receive no payment.\n\nTherefore, mining pools may choose from any of the following payment methods depending on the share amount:\n\nPay-Per-Share (PPS)\n\nMiners receive shares under the PPS model, which can be paid at any moment throughout the hashing process. PPS allows miners to be compensated for valid shares supplied, independent of whether or not a block was solved during their participation.\n\nThe pool operators will pay miners from their balance to make payments. Share prices are set here, and miners are frequently informed in advance.\n\nPPS+ awards are a new form of PPS rewards. This solution effectively runs the PPS mechanism alongside the TX fees provided in the block. These TX fees are dispersed in the form of PPLNs (more on this later). The PPS + rewards method decreases the possibility of miners not being rewarded for their contributions to pools.\n\nSadly, there is a drawback to this plan. In order to cover their risks, pool operators typically charge large fees.\n\nProportional\n\nThis approach distributes awards to members according to their respective shares of the pool\u2019s total shares. The Proportional reward operates in this manner. The more shares you can purchase, the more computer power you have, and the longer you mined to obtain the block.\n\nScore-Based\n\nThe goal of the score-based payment system was to minimize pool hopping. Your computing power and mining time are calculated by pool operators in this case, and they combine them to produce a \u201cscoring hash rate\u201d score.\n\nTherefore, the longer you participate, the better your score will be and the value of the shares you receive will increase. When you stop mining, both your score and the value of your shares decrease. Miners are paid when they discover a block.\n\nPay Per Last N Shares (PPLNS)\n\nOnly during a predefined \u201cwindow,\u201d which closes with the securing of a block, do miners in PPLNS receive payment for the shares allotted to them.\n\nShares owned outside of this timeframe do not receive rewards, unlike other payment plans. In this plan, windows could be described as a period of time or as a specific number (N) that indicates the miner\u2019s most recent share allocation up until the block\u2019s solution.\n\nOnly the final billion shares, for instance, will be compensated when a block is discovered if N equals 1 billion. If N isn\u2019t defined, it\u2019s often set as a constant and a multiple of mining difficulty.\n\nWith PPLNS, miners can either receive no incentives if they do not receive any shares within the range, or they can receive higher payments if they obtain more shares in the most recent N shares.\n\n7 Best Bitcoin Mining Pools\n\nIt is best to join a Bitcoin mining pool that rewards miners with the highest hash rate when you have the best and most recent mining hardware for that algorithm and cryptocurrency. Otherwise, if you have an out-of-date device with a low hash rate, your chances of winning rewards or having your hash rate accepted are less favorable.\n\nF2Pool\n\nBeing among the best mining pools for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, F2Pool began its mining operation in 2013. The pool can be used for merged mining, which is the process of mining several cryptocurrencies on various blockchains. Free money can also be obtained by mining Bitcoin using a pool.\n\nThe fact that F2Pool supports mining in various cryptocurrencies is one of its biggest advantages. These consist of Litecoin, Ether, and ZCash. The payout threshold for the pool\u2019s daily automatic payout is 0.005 BTC, nevertheless.\n\nWith an 18.26% share of the overall Bitcoin mining pool hash rate, it is now the largest Bitcoin mining pool.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOver 1,000,000 pieces of mining equipment from across the world are used to host mining for users.

The payment options are something else you should look into, and the majority of the pools on this list let you select from a variety of options.\n\nThe lowest possible fees should be taken into account as well. The possibility of zero-fee mining with Slush Pool\u2019s proprietary Braiins OS software should be taken into consideration.\n\nThe majority of the options on the list let you connect CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, or rental hash rates, but none of them offer Bitcoin mining on smartphones.\n\nJoining mining pools like Kano Pools, which emphasize ASICs, makes it more difficult for you to gain shares if you are using a CPU or GPU. Other cryptocurrency pools use varying difficulty algorithms to distribute challenging tasks among stronger and weaker miners, respectively. This offers a reasonable opportunity to get rewarded in the mining pool."
