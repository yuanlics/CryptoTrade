        "content": "An unknown bitcoin user sent 26.9 BTC -7.68% , worth $1.17 million, to the network\u2019s Genesis wallet \u2014 the first wallet ever created on the Bitcoin network \u2014 funds that they\u2019re unlikely to ever get back.\n\nThe transaction took place on January 5 at 1.52 AM ET. The bitcoin was sent from this wallet, which is now empty, to the Genesis wallet. The fee for the transaction was $100, far above average.\n\nThe wallet was originally funded in a complex transaction that involved funds moving from three wallets to 12 other wallets. The majority of the funds came from a wallet labeled as belonging to Binance on blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence.\n\n\"Either Satoshi woke up, bought 27 bitcoin from Binance, and deposited into their wallet, or someone just burned a million dollars,\" said Conor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, on X.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Genesis wallet?\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe Genesis wallet is the first wallet ever created on the Bitcoin network. It was created by the pseudonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who created the Bitcoin network. Nakamoto also likely mined a high number of other blocks in the network\u2019s early days but it\u2019s unclear exactly how many.\n\nWhile theoretically, Nakamoto could still be holding onto their private keys to access these wallets and could move or return the funds, the general consensus is that this would be unlikely to happen. This is because funds from wallets associated with Nakamoto, including funds held in the Genesis block, have not moved since Nakamoto\u2019s disappearance in Dec. 2010.\n\nWhen Nakamoto disappeared, the Genesis wallet only contained the 50 bitcoin that was mined when it was created. Over time, more funds were sent to the wallet and its balance rose to 72 bitcoin in late 2023. With the latest transaction, the current balance is now 99.67 bitcoin, worth $4.3 million.\n\nThis is a drop in the bucket for Nakamoto though. Estimates are that they control as much as 1.1 million bitcoin, currently worth $47 billion \u2014 on paper, that is."

        "title": "2 Major Risks Investors Should Know Before Buying Bitcoin in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's hard not to be bullish on Bitcoin (BTC -9.11%) in 2024. Last year, Bitcoin was up more than 150% and soundly outperformed every major market benchmark. At a recent price of $45,000, Bitcoin was trading at its highest level since April 2022. On top of all that, anticipation is growing over the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and what that might mean for the future price of Bitcoin.\n\nBut that doesn't mean an investment in Bitcoin is without risk. In fact, there might be two major risks investors are overlooking.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe first risk involves the imminent launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market. Over the final months of 2023, this looked like a slam-dunk certainty, with many expecting the SEC to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF in early January. After all, more than a dozen Wall Street firms have submitted ETF applications, and they have been carefully updating and amending these applications as needed.\n\nBut the latest word in the crypto markets is that the SEC might delay any approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF until there is a more comprehensive regulatory framework in place for crypto within the United States. Obviously, this would be devastating news for Bitcoin investors, given that much of the recent run-up in price has been driven by anticipation around approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMoreover, even if the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF, there's still the matter of what will happen to the price of Bitcoin. If you believe in efficient markets, then much of the expected price bump that Bitcoin is expected to get after official approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF may already be priced in. That might be a shock to some investors, who are likely assuming that official SEC approval sometime in January is automatically going to send the price of Bitcoin soaring.\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, the price of Bitcoin might actually decline in the short term. That's due to a well-known market phenomenon called \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\" In short, investors buy ahead of anticipated news of a major event. Then, once the event actually occurs, they sell, in order to take profits. So if you're expecting a major bounce in the price of Bitcoin in early 2024, you might want to readjust your expectations.\n\nThe arrival of institutional investors\n\nThe other risk involves the sudden influx of many new institutional investors into crypto at one time. Right now, everyone is focused on the potential tsunami of new money flooding into Bitcoin, which is almost certain to prop up the price of Bitcoin. The basic thinking here is that these institutional investors will be looking to allocate 1% or more of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Given that the largest of these investors manage trillions of dollars in assets, this could result in billions of dollars eventually flowing into Bitcoin.\n\nBut what's actually going to happen to Bitcoin over the long haul? Remember -- Bitcoin is not just a financial asset, it is also a technological innovation that relies on a vibrant blockchain ecosystem. Crypto executive Arthur Hayes, for example, thinks that the entry of large institutional investors into crypto will \"completely destroy Bitcoin.\" As he points out, the biggest institutional investors are in the \"asset accumulation game,\" and their goal will be to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible.\n\nAs Wall Street goes into asset accumulation mode, it could transform Bitcoin from a dynamic, thriving blockchain with multiple use cases into a lifeless blockchain where nothing interesting ever happens. A large percentage of the world's Bitcoin will essentially be locked up in a vault on Wall Street, doing nothing. In a worst-case scenario, Bitcoin miners will simply stop mining Bitcoin because it is no longer profitable, and Bitcoin as we know it, says Hayes, will simply \"vanish.\" The race will then be on to find the next great cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\n\nYes, Bitcoin, but which way to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nTo make sense of all this, I've been keeping my eye on what the \"smart money\" is doing ahead of the arrival of the new Bitcoin ETFs. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, appears to be searching for the best investment vehicle for Bitcoin. At year-end, Ark Invest sold shares in Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%), which is viewed as a Bitcoin proxy stock, and also sold shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -5.76%), which is trying to convert into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Ark Invest then bought shares of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO -5.59%), which tracks the performance of Bitcoin using futures contracts (and not spot Bitcoin).\n\nThus, the decision of whether or not to invest in Bitcoin is slightly more nuanced than you might assume. It's up to you as an investor to decide (a) if Bitcoin is right for you and, if so, (b) what the best way to invest in it will be going forward. Heading into 2024, the primary choice is shaping up to be one between spot Bitcoin (Bitcoin bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges) and a spot Bitcoin ETF."

        "title": "BlackRock layoffs coming as firm matures, ESG pullback and Bitcoin ETF approval - Fox Business",
        "content": "BlackRock, the world's largest money management firm, plans to announce layoffs in the coming days of about 3 percent of its global workforce, Fox Business has learned.\n\nThe job cuts of around 600 employees, which have yet to be reported, are being described internally as routine, according to a source familiar. Last year, BlackRock did a similar round of layoffs gauged on employee performance metrics, the source added.\n\nShares of BlackRock rebounded in 2023, up 6 percent after falling 21 percent in 2022. New customer money into BlackRock's solid Exchange Traded Fund business exploded last year with $187 billion of inflows into the products that follow a basket of securities and trade like stocks on major exchanges.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BLK BLACKROCK INC. 809.12 -16.92 -2.05%\n\nOn Wednesday, BlackRock is expecting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for its new Bitcoin \"spot\" ETF \u2014 the first time a crypto investment product tracking the daily price of the world's most popular digital coin will be approved by securities regulators to trade on a public stock market. Other asset managers are also expecting approval for their ETFs.\n\nBLACKROCK, STATE STREET FACE SUBPOENAS IN HOUSE ESG PROBE\n\nA BlackRock spokesman would not comment on the layoffs. BlackRock is scheduled to announce fourth quarter earnings on Friday.\n\nOne possible impetus for the layoffs is that BlackRock, after years of wild growth in assets under management or AUM, is settling into a more mature phase in its business. Analyst consensus for earnings in its fourth quarter projects a 2.46 percent decline year-over-year to $8.71 a share.\n\nBlackRock finished the third quarter of 2023 with $9 trillion in AUM though the firm has seen significant asset declines since it reached a peak of more than $10 trillion in 2022 amid wobbly financial markets. The decline in assets also came as BlackRock became a political lightning rod over its embrace of Environmental Social Governance investing, or ESG, which directs investment dollars into public companies in the sustainable energy space, or those that are taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint and advocate corporate governance measures such as boardroom diversity.\n\nDECEMBER JOBS BREAKDOWN: WHICH INDUSTRIES HIRED THE MOST WORKERS LAST MONTH?\n\nThe firm has been de-emphasizing its ESG business in the U.S. amid the controversy, Fox Business has learned. U.S. portfolio managers are no longer required to consider ESG metrics when not using ESG funds. In 2023, many so-called green investment funds have seen declines in asset amid weak performance as investments in sustainable energy products fail to produce significant returns.\n\nCompany founder and CEO Larry Fink told Fox Business he won't use the mention of the letters E-S-G any longer because of the controversy it has stirred up in political circles.\n\nUS ECONOMY ADDS 216K JOBS IN DECEMBER, BEATING EXPECTATIONS\n\nAs top Republicans, including several running for the GOP presidential nomination, have attacked BlackRock and ESG, those running pension funds in red states have yanked about $6 billion from BlackRock funds as a form of protest.\n\nNoticeably quiet from the BlackRock bashing is the GOP front-runner, former President Donald Trump. One reason may be because BlackRock once managed Trump's fortune, estimated in the billions of dollars. In 2017, Trump said of Fink: \"Larry did a great job for me. He managed a lot of my money. I have to tell you, he got me great returns.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nPeople close to BlackRock tell Fox Business that savings from the job cuts will be used to expand into growth businesses such as technology investing and investing in so-called alternative products as opposed to stocks and bonds.\n\nESG, meanwhile, remains a big business with BlackRock's foreign customers, including large sovereign wealth funds in Europe and the Middle East. Mark Wiedman, head of BlackRock's client business, speaking at a recent event sponsored by the news outlet Semafor, called ESG \"a demand from clients,\" with around $1 trillion in pure sustainable assets being managed by BlackRock."

        "content": "This news release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated August 17, 2023, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated May 1, 2023.\n\nVancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 8, 2024) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\") is pleased to announce the summarized unaudited production figures from the Company's global Bitcoin operations for the 2023 calendar year. Production totaled 3,260 Bitcoin mined, and hashrate increased by 100% in the 2023 calendar year, from 2 Exahash per second (\"EH/s\") at the end of December 2022 to 4 EH/s at the end of December 2023 (all amounts in US dollars, unless otherwise indicated).\n\nHIVE has maintained approximately 1% of the global Bitcoin mining network through 2023, mining an average of approximately 9 Bitcoin per day throughout the calendar year of 2023, by maintaining a growing hashrate over the course of the year, that has generally kept pace with the Bitcoin mining network hashrate growth. With the total daily block rewards of the Bitcoin mining network averaging 900 Bitcoin per day, or 328,500 Bitcoin in a calendar year, HIVE earning 3,260 Bitcoin for calendar 2023 is approximately 1% of the Bitcoin mining network.\n\nThroughout calendar 2023 the Bitcoin mining network continued to attract more efficient ASIC machines to compete for the 900 new Bitcoin mined per day, as HIVE'S network hashrate grew from approximately 2 EH/s from the beginning of 2023 to approximately 4 EH/s at the end of 2023. Accordingly, Mining Difficulty1 also increased approximately 100% year over year, from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, as per www.blockchain.com. This is how HIVE maintained approximately 1% of the total Bitcoin rewards mined in calendar 2023.\n\nHIVE ended the 2023 calendar year with approximately $17 million in cash and a Bitcoin HODL position of 1,704 BTC. As mentioned in the Company's December 19, 2023, news release, the Company's HODL strategy is such that it anticipates to be able to HODL all its Bitcoin until the upcoming Halving which is expected to be in April 2024 after which the number of new Bitcoin mined per day will drop to 450 Bitcoins per day.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitmain S19k Pro Update\n\nHIVE also announces that further to its news releases dated November 14, 2023, and December 4, 2023, all 9,800 of the Bitmain S19k Pro Antminers ordered by the Company have shipped. Currently approximately 70% have been installed, and it is expected that 100% of these machines will be installed before January 2024 month-end. After these miners are installed, it is expected that HIVE will have 4.8 EH/s of ASICs with an average fleet efficiency of 28.7 J/TH.\n\nIn addition, further to its news release dated December 21, 2023, upon the completion of the installation of the 7,000 Bitmain S21 Antminers ordered in December 2023, which will begin in January 2024 and is expected to be completed in June 2024, it is expected that HIVE will have an average fleet efficiency of 25 J/TH and a total of 5.6 EH/s of active mining capacity.\n\nAbout HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. went public in 2017 as the first cryptocurrency mining company listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange with a sustainable green or renewable energy focus. HIVE's electricity is sourced from hydro and geothermal facilities in Sweden, Canada and Iceland.\n\nHIVE is a growth-oriented technology stock in the emergent blockchain industry. As a company whose shares trade on major stock exchanges, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sector and traditional capital markets. HIVE owns green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we endeavour to source green energy to mine digital assets such as Bitcoin on the cloud. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its treasury of BTC derived from mining rewards. Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of Bitcoin. Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWe encourage you to visit HIVE's YouTube channel here to learn more about HIVE.\n\nFor more information and to register to HIVE's mailing list, please visit www.HIVEdigitaltechnologies.com.

The bitcoin used to buy a $20 pizza at the beginning of 2023, for example, would be worth over $50. Infamously, the first purchase made with Bitcoin were two large pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin that would be worth $44 million at today's prices.\n\nBitcoin vendors are located around the world, but appear to be concentrated in Europe, the United States, and especially Latin America. While the Phillippines has hundreds of vendors tagged, East Asia seems to be lagging in adoption, with China's population of over 1.4 billion lacking any vendors, due to the cryptocurrency ban in the country."

        "title": "Bitcoin: Assessing the odds of a BTC trend reversal - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "The Bitcoin range formation of the past month remained in play.\n\nThe on-chain metrics showed investors need not worry about a downtrend yet.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] saw a large amount of volatility on 3rd January as prices fell by 6.3% on the day. Despite the selling pressure, on-chain metrics such as the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) suggested that the market is in a healthy bullish state.\n\nAMBCrypto recently reported that the Coinbase Premium was on the rise. It has been positive since September, with a brief drop into the negative territory in mid-December.\n\nThis was a sign of steady buying pressure on Coinbase. It sparked speculation of consistent buying activity from institutional investors ahead of a Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nAMBCrypto took a look at other metrics to understand where BTC stands.\n\nAssessing the available ammunition for the bulls\n\nThe Coinbase Premium Gap has been positive for most of the time since October. It dipped into the negative territory in mid-December. Its inference has already been mentioned, but it can be combined with other metrics to provide keener insight.\n\nOne such metric is the Stablecoin Supply Ratio. It is defined as the market cap of BTC divided by the total market cap of all stablecoins. A low value for this metric indicates high buying power.\n\nThe chart above shows that the ratio has spiked since early October. This meant buying power has been declining. The strong demand for BTC, not just on Coinbase but across exchanges, saw the king coin rally from $26k in October to reach $44k in December.\n\nThe metric seemed to hit a ceiling over the past month. This was a sign that market participants could be watching and waiting. The ETF applications and debate over their approval and the impact on BTC prices could be causing this indecision.\n\nThe NUPL hit a high not seen since December 2021, but investors need not fear\n\nOn 5th December 2023, the Bitcoin NUPL climbed above 0.5. The last time this happened was back on 27th December 2021. This does not mean a reversal is around the corner. Instead, the market is neither in a state of euphoria nor despair.\n\nThe NUPL has formed a plateau over the past month. This is tied to the price action of the asset as well, for BTC was unable to continue its uptrend in recent months. An increase in BTC inflows to exchanges was part of the reason.\n\nThe past five days saw a rise in the 7-day Simple Moving Average of the Bitcoin Netflow. This meant that reserves on exchanges were increasing, even as BTC prices straddled the range highs. Hence, this metric\u2019s continued rise would be useful to monitor.\n\nThe same uptrend happened in mid-December as well. This saw Bitcoin fall from $43k to $40.5k. The range formation of Bitcoin is also something investors and traders must keep an eye on.\n\nThe range (purple) has been in play since 11th December. It extended from $40.5k to $44.3k. The breakout on 2 January appeared clean, and a retest of the highs would have been a good buying opportunity.\n\nInstead, Bitcoin dropped like a rock to $40.7k on 3rd January. Since then, it has rebounded to the $43.6k mark. The OBV has been in a gradual decline since 11th December.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nAttempts to revive an uptrend on the OBV have been cut short. This suggested a lack of buying volume. The RSI was at 51 to signal a possible shift in the momentum in favor of the sellers.\n\nHence, BTC holders must be prepared for a drop to the range lows and potentially far lower. Key levels to watch for the coming week are the mid-range mark at $42.5k and the recent highs at $45.9k."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs Could Launch This Week. Here's How Much You'll Pay in Fees and Why It Might Be Worth It. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Thirteen spot Bitcoin (BTC -8.83%) ETFs are currently awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nUp to this point, the SEC has denied similar exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, but an appellate court ruled the SEC's rejection was \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nThe approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be big news for investors of all sorts. Whether you're heavily invested in crypto or simply stashing money away in a retirement account, it's worth paying attention to the SEC's decision. It could open the door for many more investors to easily put their money to work in the emerging crypto asset class.\n\nWhy the new breed of Bitcoin ETFs is big news\n\nExisting Bitcoin funds like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust use derivatives like futures contracts to track the price of Bitcoin. However, those funds cannot actually redeem Bitcoin futures for the underlying asset, which can result in prices that diverge widely from the actual value of Bitcoin. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust notably traded at almost a 50% discount to its net asset value in late 2022.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF, on the other hand, will actually hold Bitcoin. That means the ETF will be able to track the value of the cryptocurrency much more closely.\n\nAdditionally, since the funds will hold Bitcoin instead of a derivative, it makes it more transparent for investors as to what they're buying. Each share of the ETF will correspond with a certain amount of Bitcoin held by the fund.\n\nThat said, spot Bitcoin ETFs will still charge fees for shareholders in the form of expense ratios. And with such strong interest in the new breed of ETFs, it's important for investors to pay attention to these fees and what they mean for their investment.\n\nHere's how much you'll pay in fees to own a Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe following four fund companies have detailed how much they plan to charge investors holding their respective Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFund Expense Ratio Fidelity Wise Origin 0.39% Invesco Galaxy 0.59% Valkyrie 0.8% ARK 21Shares 0.8%\n\nInvesco Galaxy plans to waive the fee for the first six months for the first $5 billion in invested assets. That's not an uncommon strategy for new funds entering a competitive market. However, it might not be worth it for long-term investors to try to buy shares of the Invesco fund and then switch to a lower-cost fund after the free period expires once you account for taxes.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that most of the proposed ETFs haven't detailed their fees. Blackrock is notably missing from the above list. Given the size of the fund company, investors should expect it to offer a relatively low fee.\n\nMost importantly for investors, it should be noted that the published fees are all well below the expense ratios for existing Bitcoin investment products. Grayscale charges a 2% management fee. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF charges 0.95%. So, not only will investors get a fund that tracks Bitcoin better, it will be cheaper, too.\n\nOn top of that, there are a few other reasons investors may want to pay the fees for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe benefits of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nFor many investors, a spot Bitcoin ETF will be the easiest and safest way to invest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile it's simple enough to open an account at a crypto exchange and buy Bitcoin, it's not so simple to open a retirement account with a crypto exchange. You'll have to establish your own self-directed individual retirement account (IRA) and use that to open and fund an account with a cryptocurrency exchange. And that's not cheap. For most investors simply looking to use Bitcoin for portfolio diversification, an ETF makes much more sense despite the fees.\n\nThere's also the convenience of being able to hold your Bitcoin investment in the same account as your other investments. That gives you a better picture of your overall portfolio without having to aggregate everything across multiple accounts.\n\nFor many investors, the technical hurdles involved in buying and securely holding Bitcoin can be cumbersome. With an ETF, the managing institution will take care of those technical aspects. The institution will likely use multiple levels of security and cold storage to maximize the safety of the Bitcoin it holds for investors.\n\nUltimately, the fees on the new spot Bitcoin ETFs are extremely reasonable, even compared to standard index funds. Take for instance the Invesco QQQ Trust, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. It charges an expense ratio of 0.2%. So, paying as little as 0.39% for a Bitcoin ETF isn't going to break the bank."

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC -9.11%) soared by more than 150% last year, investors are now looking far and wide for cryptocurrencies that might be able to outperform Bitcoin in 2024. One intriguing candidate is Ethereum (ETH -9.51%), which is still the world's second-most valuable cryptocurrency with a whopping $270 billion market cap.\n\nWhile Ethereum might not get the same hype as Bitcoin, it's certainly worth a closer look, especially if some of the catalysts expected to push Bitcoin higher fail to materialize. Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nJust about everyone agrees that investor anticipation of a new spot Bitcoin ETF is the key factor pushing Bitcoin higher right now. The underlying logic makes sense: A new regulated financial product for investing in Bitcoin should attract money from both retail and institutional investors. If institutional investors with trillions of dollars of assets under management allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, that could result in literally tens of billions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin. That would almost certainly cause the price of Bitcoin to soar.\n\nBut there are several problems with that argument, says JPMorgan Chase (JPM -1.78%). In a December research note to clients, JPMorgan Chase specifically pointed out that much of the hype around the Bitcoin ETF might be undeserved. For one, spot Bitcoin ETF products exist elsewhere in the world (in both Canada and Europe), and they have experienced relatively weak demand. What's to say that the U.S. market will be different?\n\nMoreover, there are other Bitcoin investment products to choose from right now. Popular choices include Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -5.76%) and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO -5.59%). So instead of huge flows of new money into Bitcoin, we might just see a reshuffling of money out of existing Bitcoin investment products and into the new spot Bitcoin ETF. The net impact, in that case, would not be nearly as great as some are now predicting.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nThe second major catalyst for Bitcoin is the approaching halving event. This event, which occurs only once every four years, is coming up in April, and it's likely to be one of the most talked-about developments in the crypto market this year. In three past halvings, the price of Bitcoin has soared, and many investors are expecting the same to happen again. In fact, some are now predicting that Bitcoin could push through the $100,000 mark by the end of the year.\n\nBut keep in mind that a growing number of influential voices on Wall Street think that much of the Bitcoin halving's impact might already be priced in. If you buy into the efficient market hypothesis, which says that all publicly available information is already factored into prices, then maybe the halving will be a non-event.\n\nAfter all, the entire market knows when the halving is going to take place. There are websites with clocks counting down the seconds. And the entire market has plenty of historical data to work with. Granted, the crypto market may not be as efficient as the equity market at pricing in information, but it's safe to say that every major Wall Street firm is aware of the implications of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe case for Ethereum\n\nWhile Ethereum may not have the same kinds of catalysts as Bitcoin, it is working on significant improvements to its overall blockchain architecture. Ethereum has not really delivered on everything it originally promised for The Merge, when it transitioned to a much more energy effective network. This year might be an opportunity to reassure investors that everything is still on track. If these improvements lead to lower fees, faster transaction speeds, and higher overall throughput, it could make Ethereum much more attractive to investors.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is more likely to benefit from increased development activity in crypto than Bitcoin. That's because Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, is active in just about every major niche of the blockchain and crypto world, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, the metaverse, and Web3. During the long crypto winter that set in during 2022, many of these areas went into hibernation. But in a crypto spring, they could come back to life.\n\nAnd the better buy is...\n\nI've tried to make a compelling case for Ethereum, but if forced to choose between Bitcoin and Ethereum, I'm still going with Bitcoin. Yes, the new spot Bitcoin ETF might be overhyped. And yes, the Bitcoin halving cycle might be underwhelming this time around. But with so much institutional investor support behind it now, Bitcoin is closer to going mainstream than at any time in its history. If there's just one crypto to buy in 2024, it's Bitcoin."

        "title": "3 Crypto Predictions for 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a brutal crypto winter in 2022, the resurgence that swept through the crypto asset class in 2023 was more than refreshing. With signs that a bull market might be looming ahead, 2024 is shaping up to be a year for the history books.\n\nWhile they might seem outlandish, here are three predictions for the upcoming year. Remember, this is crypto -- stranger things have happened.\n\nIt's still Bitcoin's year\n\nLet's cut to the chase: Bitcoin (BTC -9.11%) might have a better 2024 than it did in 2023. With the first prediction for the new year, Bitcoin should hit a new all-time high.\n\nLast year, Bitcoin's rise could be attributed to the anticipated approval of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and fresh interest in novel use cases like Ordinals, a Bitcoin-based equivalent of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nWhile these two catalysts helped renew sentiment across the crypto market, they will likely prove to be minor accelerants compared to what 2024 has in store. The most influential development pushing Bitcoin toward an all-time high is the upcoming halving. Hardwired into Bitcoin's code, the halving reduces Bitcoin's inflation rate in half roughly every four years. Currently sitting at 1.75%, in April of this year it will fall to 0.85%.\n\nHistorically, halvings have been significant drivers of price appreciation as demand must adjust to a diminished inflation rate. In years that a halving occurred, Bitcoin has grown by more than 128% on average. A jump of this magnitude would put Bitcoin's price at $99,000 -- a new all-time high.\n\nTo take it a step further, this halving will be unlike any other. For most of Bitcoin's history, the rate of freshly mined supply more or less kept up with demand. But that shifted recently. Currently, only 2.3 million coins are available on exchanges for purchase, a level not seen since 2017. As a result, the upcoming halving will be the first time in history that there are fewer available coins than at the previous halving. With an unprecedented supply shock inbound, don't be surprised if Bitcoin hits six figures in 2023.\n\nThe Bitcoin renaissance continues\n\nCategorized as a Layer 2 blockchain since it operates in tandem with a Layer 1 blockchain, Stacks (STX -9.25%) unlocks Bitcoin to take on new use cases and realize its true potential as the foundation of a decentralized economy.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the popularity of Ordinals sparked interest in building Bitcoin-based solutions, allowing it to take on use cases beyond just a store of value. As general interest transformed into a movement, Stacks became a natural beneficiary with its Bitcoin compatibility and rose more than 200% in 2023. Yet this is just scratching the surface of what may come in 2024.\n\nScheduled to go live in April, the Nakamoto Release will unveil novel functionality that allows Bitcoin holders to swap their Bitcoin for a new asset, sBTC, and then use that token across the DeFi economy. Once finishing their DeFi activities, holders can seamlessly redeem their sBTC for the original BTC. Since sBTC's price is pegged to BTC, there is no slippage, and best of all, the exchange process is done in a decentralized and secure fashion through the use of smart contracts, preserving Bitcoin's distinct characteristics.\n\nFor the second prediction of 2024, expect Stacks to double in value and become a top 20 most valuable cryptocurrency. With the Bitcoin renaissance gaining steam, Stacks is in an ideal position to continue growing and claim the spotlight.\n\nEthereum is overdue for a run\n\nWhile Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies rode waves of momentum in 2023, Ethereum (ETH -9.51%) more or less watched from the sidelines. It still jumped an admirable 80% but paled in comparison to other notable altcoins like Solana, which made gains of more than 900%, and Avalanche, which jumped 250%.\n\nBut this might change in 2024 as Ethereum is scheduled to get another critical upgrade. Known as EIP-4844 and expected to be released in the second half of the year, the upgrade will reduce transaction costs and boost throughput to 100,000 transactions per second, effectively solving two of the main challenges hampering Ethereum's maturation. Building off of The Merge from 2022, a previous upgrade that switched the blockchain from proof of work to proof of stake, EIP-4844 is just one out of a series of upgrades that aims to \"grow Ethereum until it's powerful enough to help all of humanity.\"\n\nDespite its lackluster performance in 2023, Ethereum remains the premier blockchain for novel use cases of cryptocurrencies such as decentralized finance, NFTs, yield farming, and more. When considering the added benefit EIP-4844 will bring to the ecosystem, my third prediction for 2024 is that it should be the year that Ethereum reminds the crypto world that it is the undisputed home of decentralized finance and makes a run of historic magnitude."
