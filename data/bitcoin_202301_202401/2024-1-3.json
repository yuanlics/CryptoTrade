        "content": "Texas was gasping for electricity. Winter Storm Uri had knocked out power plants across the state, leaving tens of thousands of homes in icy darkness. By the end of Feb. 14, 2021, nearly 40 people had died, some from the freezing cold.\n\nMeanwhile, in the husk of a onetime aluminum smelting plant an hour outside of Austin, row upon row of computers were using enough electricity to power about 6,500 homes as they raced to earn Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe computers were performing trillions of calculations per second, hunting for an elusive combination of numbers that Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm would accept. About every 10 minutes, a computer somewhere guesses correctly and wins a small number of Bitcoins worth, in recent weeks, about $170,000. Anyone can try, but to make a business of it can require as much electricity as a small city.\n\nIn Texas, the computers kept running until just after midnight. Then the state\u2019s power grid operator ordered them shut off, under an agreement that allowed it to do so if the system was about to fail. In return, it began paying the Bitcoin company, Bitdeer, an average of $175,000 an hour to keep the computers offline. Over the next four days, Bitdeer would make more than $18 million for not operating, from fees ultimately paid by Texans who had endured the storm.\n\nThe New York Times has identified 34 such large-scale operations, known as Bitcoin mines, in the United States, all putting immense pressure on the power grid and most finding novel ways to profit from doing so. Their operations can create costs \u2014 including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution \u2014 for everyone around them, most of whom have nothing to do with Bitcoin.\n\nUntil June 2021, most Bitcoin mining was in China. Then it drove out Bitcoin operations, at least for a time, citing their power use among other reasons. The United States quickly became the industry\u2019s global leader."

Unlike banknotes or minted coins that have a tangible physical form, cryptocurrencies can only be accessed using computers and other electronic devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA decentralized currency is a currency not issued by a government or financial institution. In fact, no single person, company, or government controls a crypto's blockchain. Instead, it's run by a decentralized network of computers worldwide. Anyone with advanced technology skills and coding experience can create a cryptocurrency.\n\nThe lack of a central authority can also make cryptocurrencies more secure. \"It's hack-proof because there's no one central point of failure,\" explains David Donovan, executive vice president at Publicis Sapient.\n\nHow do cryptocurrencies work?\n\nWhile there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, many with unique traits, they all tend to work in similar ways. It's hard to avoid some jargon when discussing cryptos, but the concepts can be relatively easy to understand.\n\nBlockchain technology\n\nA cryptocurrency's blockchain is a digital record of all the transactions involving that crypto. Copies of the blockchain are stored and maintained by computers around the world. They're often compared to general ledgers, part of traditional double-entry bookkeeping systems where each transaction leads to debit and credit in different sections of the books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It works like a general ledger \u2014 it's that simple,\" says Donovan. Perhaps you start with two coins and send one to someone. \"On the blockchain, it would say I'm sending you one coin, and I now have one coin, and you have one coin.\"\n\nEach grouping of transactions is turned into a block and chained to the existing ledger. Once a block is added it can't be reversed or altered \u2014 which is why people describe blockchains as \"immutable.\"\n\nSome cryptos have their own blockchain. For example, there are Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. But there are also cryptos that are built on top of an existing blockchain rather than starting from zero.\n\nEther is the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain, but is also available for trading on other exchanges like Coinbase, Binance.US, and Robinhood.\n\nPublic transactions under pseudonymous\n\nCryptocurrencies have another defining feature. The blockchains are public ledgers, which means anyone can see and review the transactions that occurred. However, they can also provide a degree of anonymity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You have a private key, which is how you initiate transactions, and a public key, which is how someone identifies you in the market,\" says Donovan.\n\nA blockchain's transactions are tied to a crypto wallet's public key, but nobody necessarily knows who controls that wallet. This is why cryptos are often described as pseudonymous \u2014 the public key is a person's pseudonym.\n\nComing to consensus Cryptocurrencies commonly use one of two mechanisms to create a system of trust and determine which transactions are valid and added to their blockchain:\n\n\n\nProof of work . This relies on people around the world, known as miners, competing to be first to solve complex cryptographic puzzles and add the next block to the blockchain. The winners are paid after the other members of the network confirm that the required amount of computing power was used to find the solution. \"The way you make sure all the participants are validating the transactions is the hard work, effort, and money they're spending solving the problem,\" says Donna Parisi, global head of financial services and FinTech at Shearman & Sterling. However, proof-of-work systems require a lot of energy to power.\n\n.

However, proof-of-work systems require a lot of energy to power. Proof of stake. This is a newer and less energy-intensive mechanism. \"Proof of stake is they validate transactions on the blockchain by people putting value on the line,\" explains Parisi. \"They stake some of the currency they own to make sure they only validate true transactions.\"\n\nTypes of cryptocurrencies\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there were more than 25,149 different cryptocurrencies with a global market value of about $1.16 trillion as of May 30, 2023. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies include:\n\nBitcoin\n\nDogecoin\n\nEther\n\nLitecoin\n\nTether\n\nBinance coin\n\nDai\n\nTRON\n\nCronos\n\nUSD coin\n\nBitcoin cash\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was launched in 2009 as an alternative type of decentralized and digital money. Since then, people have also created cryptocurrencies that serve other functions or are designed for specific types of transactions.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies can have many different uses,\" says Parisi. \"Some are used in gaming environments to earn rewards in a game, while others facilitate payments. Some are designed for cross-border remittances \u2026 some are designed for micro payments.\"\n\nFor example, stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that try to maintain a steady and fixed exchange rate with another asset, such as the US dollar. Governance tokens are another example of a specialized cryptocurrency. They give token holders voting power in a corresponding crypto project.\n\nInsider's Featured Crypto Apps Public Investing\n\nWealthfront Investing Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.

This money has no physical equivalent, unlike tangible forms of currency like banknotes or minted coins. But just like physical money, digital currencies can be used to purchase goods and services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, you'll be limited to online platforms and communities, such as investing platforms, gaming sites, and gambling portals. Some of the most popular forms of digital currency include cryptocurrencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDC), and stablecoins.\n\n\"There's a strive toward decentralization,\" says Nisa Amoils, a managing partner at A100xx Ventures. \"Digital currencies like cryptocurrencies continue to be a worthwhile investment for many investors.\"\n\nDigital currencies come in two forms:\n\nCentralized currency: Currencies issued by governments or financial institutions as part of the commercial banking system that are available to the general public.\n\nCurrencies issued by governments or financial institutions as part of the commercial banking system that are available to the general public. Decentralized currency: Currencies not issued by governments or financial institutions. Instead, decentralized currencies operate through peer-to-peer financial networks to eliminate the middleman (aka banks) and allow lending, trading, and borrowing directly with merchants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDigital currencies like crypto are often appealing to investors who are wary of government-issued funds and are that are seeking alternatives.\n\n\"Some people who had been excluded from the traditional financial system, or have had their currencies devalued, are seeking an opportunity to participate in the markets, and this is a retail-driven phenomenon first,\" says Amoils. \"There's this crisis of trust, and people want wealth creation for themselves. And so that spurred this whole kind of trading speculative movement.\"\n\nHow to invest in cryptocurrency\n\nYou can start investing in cryptocurrencies through existing crypto exchanges and investing platforms. Some of the best cryptocurrency exchanges (such as Kraken and Coinbase) offer assets like staking rewards, goal-planning features, low fees, and more.\n\nSome of the best investment apps that offer cryptocurrencies (such as Robinhood Investing) include a range of investment types, low fees, market access, and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can create your own crypto\n\nAnyone with coding skills and/or advanced technical knowledge can create their own cryptocurrencies \u2014 although this is not always an easy feat and isn't recommended for beginners. The three ways to create crypto are:\n\nBuilding a new blockchain: The most advanced way to create crypto, but offers the most flexibility of nodes, architecture, tokenomics, and more.\n\nThe most advanced way to create crypto, but offers the most flexibility of nodes, architecture, tokenomics, and more.

Still, this method requires expansive technical knowledge. Building upon a blockchain: The simplest way to make your own coins or tokens is by expanding upon an already existing blockchain. But keep in mind that the success of your cryptocurrency will be reliant on the success of the original blockchain. Some blockchains that allow this are Binance and Ethereum.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies secure?\n\nThe blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies can help ensure that the coins and systems remain secure. \"What's never been refuted is the value of blockchain,\" says Donovan. \"The way the ledger system is set up and every transaction is recorded. And the fact that it's immutable.\"\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean you don't need to worry about security. The crypto world is rife with scams. Of course, that's also true of traditional financial systems and currencies. Someone asking you to pay with a gift card or wire transfer is a red flag that you're dealing with a scammer. But several factors could make crypto scams especially worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, cryptocurrency transactions can't be reversed. There's also less regulation of cryptocurrencies and platforms than of traditional financial services in the US. Plus, some people may feel pressure to act quickly and send or invest their money because they're worried about missing out on an opportunity.\n\n\"One way to avoid a scam is to invest in more well-established cryptocurrencies,\" says Parisi. \"You still may be subject to scams or fraud in terms of how you hold it, send it, or receive it.\" But you can have some certainty that the cryptocurrency itself isn't a scam.\n\nAre cryptocurrencies a good investment?\n\nCryptocurrencies may present a good investment opportunity, and there are many ways to invest in the crypto world.\n\nYou could buy a coin (or coins) and hold onto them, hoping they'll increase in value. Or you could use your coins in a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform to earn interest through staking or lending. You also might take a more traditional route, such as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is tied to cryptocurrencies. There could even be opportunities to invest in projects or supporting industries rather than in the cryptocurrencies themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"From an investment perspective, crypto is rapidly evolving,\" says Parisi. \"You shouldn't put an amount of assets you're not willing to lose. It should be, relatively speaking, a small portion of your portfolio.\"\n\nBefore making any investment, consider the potential pros and cons:\n\nPros Cons Easy to invest\n\nDiversify your portfolio\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity\n\nFaster and cost-effective transactions\n\nDecentralized currency\n\nSecurity and transparency through the blockchain Cryptocurrencies can be very volatile\n\nSome crypto projects may fail\n\nThe investment may be a scam\n\nEnvironmental impact due to excessive power consumption through ASIC computers\n\nLacking refund and cancellation policies\n\nShould you invest in crypto?\n\nWhile cryptocurrency investing is a hotly debated topic, it's worth understanding what's going on so you can make an informed decision. If you decide to get started, you could fully jump in or just dip your toe.\n\n\"Learn about crypto by opening up wallets, accounts, trading currencies, and learning more about the use cases,\" says Parisi. \"But do it in a reasonable way. We're still in the early days, and regulation of crypto is still evolving.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonovan suggests opening an account with a regulated and publicly traded company like Coinbase. But, he says, \"It's really about being smart and using the system to take baby steps.\"\n\nCrypto FAQs\n\nWhat is Bitcoin? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, an electronic version of money that verifies transactions using cryptography (the science of encoding and decoding information). As Bitcoin educator, developer, and entrepreneur Jimmy Song says, Bitcoin is \"decentralized, digital, and scarce money.\" Bitcoin is decentralized because this code is run by thousands of computers (i.e., 'nodes') spread across the globe, digital because it exists as a set of code that determines how it operates, and scarce because its code caps its overall volume to 21 million bitcoins. When you use bitcoin to buy something, it records the transaction on a blockchain, which is essentially a ledger or database whose entries can't be modified or erased.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized computing platform network. The Ethereum network works like the Bitcoin network in that it's built on blockchain technology, essentially a digital public ledger where financial agreements can be verified and stored entirely by software \u2014 without the intervention of a third party.\n\nWhat are privacy coins? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that obscure transactions on their blockchain to maintain the anonymity of users and their activity. Participants in a transaction will know the amount transacted and the parties involved. However, the same information will be unobtainable to any outside observer. The anonymity that privacy coins provide offers a potentially appealing outlet for money laundering or other criminal transactions. As such, privacy coins are a point of contention in the ongoing debate around cryptocurrency privacy and regulation.\n\nWhat is a crypto wallet? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. A crypto wallet is a software program or physical device that allows you to store your crypto and allow for the sending and receiving of crypto transactions. A crypto wallet consists of two key pairs: private keys and public keys. A public key is derived from the private key and serves as the address used to send crypto to the wallet. The important part of a wallet \u2014 and the part where new users often find themselves getting into trouble \u2014 is the private key. A private key is like the key to a safe deposit box. Anyone who has access to the private key of a wallet can take control of the balance held there. But unlike a safe deposit box, crypto users who hold their own private keys and make transactions using non-custodial wallets (i.e., a wallet not hosted by an exchange or other third-party) become their own bank.\n\nWhat is hash rate? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Hash rate is a measure of the total computational power being used by a proof-of-work cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain. It can also be a measure of how fast a cryptocurrency miner's machines complete these computations. Miners use computers to run computations on complex mathematical puzzles based on transaction data. These systems generate millions or trillions of guesses per second as to what the solutions to these puzzles could be. These are hashes, alphanumeric codes randomized to identify a single, unique piece of data.\n\nWhat is yield farming? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yield farming is a means of earning interest on your cryptocurrency, similar to how you'd earn interest on any money in your savings account. And similarly to depositing money in a bank, yield farming involves locking up your cryptocurrency, called \"staking,\" for a period of time in exchange for interest or other rewards, such as more cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is crypto staking? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Crypto staking is similar to depositing money in a bank, in that an investor locks up their assets, and in exchange, earns rewards, or \"interest.\" \"Staking is a term used to refer to the delegating of a certain number of tokens to the governance model of the blockchain and thus locking them out of circulation for a specified length of time,\" says Nicole DeCicco, the owner and founder of CryptoConsultz, a cryptocurrency consultancy in the Portland, Oregon area. A particular network's protocol locks up an investor's holdings \u2014 similar to depositing money in a bank, and agreeing not to withdraw it for a set time period, which benefits the network in a couple of ways, according to DeCicco. First, this can increase the value of a token by limiting the supply. Second, the tokens can be used to govern the blockchain if the network uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) system. A PoS system \u2014 as opposed to a proof-of-work (PoW) one, which incorporates \"mining\" \u2014 can be fairly complicated, especially for crypto newcomers."

        "content": "The crypto world is betting its mainstream moment is here. That bet hinges on the blessing of Wall Street\u2019s top cop.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is expected in the coming days to rule on whether 14 different money managers will be allowed to launch their own spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nThese ETFs would allow everyday investors to get exposure to bitcoin (BTC-USD) without having to own it, trading it like they would a stock.\n\nThe approvals could also expand widespread acceptance of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, making bitcoin a potential staple in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans used by everyday people.\n\nThe applicants include some of the biggest names on Wall Street, from BlackRock (BLK) to Franklin Templeton (BEN), as well as a number of firms better known in the crypto world.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are among the giant banks that have offered to help some of these money managers create and redeem shares of their new funds.\n\nBlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is among the applicants seeking approval from the SEC to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. (Fatih Aktas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nThe challenge before the industry is that the SEC has in the past denied such applications, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation. The regulator is also the industry's most prominent adversary, having filed numerous lawsuits and enforcement actions against key players.\n\nThose in the crypto world say there are signs that the SEC won\u2019t stand in the way this time around and will give the green light to all 14 applicants at once.\n\nSuch optimism helped bitcoin surge more than 150% in 2023 and start 2024 by rising above $45,000, its highest level in nearly two years.\n\nIt is also helping investors move past the memories of 2022, when some of the industry\u2019s biggest names were wiped out as the values of digital assets collapsed.\n\n\"The bitcoin ETFs will be the official nail in the coffin on that prior crypto winter,\" Laurence Latimer, CEO and co-founder of crypto firm Dinara, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nA number of applicants \u2014 including Bitwise, Hashdex, and VanEck \u2014 have already released teaser video ads ahead of what they expect to be their potential launch.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s time has arrived,\" reads the tagline of the Hashdex spot.\n\nBut in a sign of how much is riding on these approvals, bitcoin tumbled nearly 10% earlier this week after one industry analyst floated a contrarian view of what the SEC may do.\n\nMarkus Thielen, head of research at crypto investment firm Matrixport, said in a note Tuesday that the SEC will reject all ETF applications this month and the products won\u2019t get the green light until at least the second quarter. If that happens, bitcoin prices could fall by 20%, according to the note.\n\n\"While we have seen frequent meetings between the ETF applicants and staff from the SEC, which resulted in the applicants refiling their applications,\" the note added, \"we believe all applications fall short of a critical requirement that must be met before the SEC approves.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler has consistently voiced skepticism about the crypto industry. (Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe note cited general skepticism from SEC chair Gary Gensler, who has led the agency\u2019s larger crackdown on the crypto world.\n\nIt also came as bitcoin trading volume spiked to highs not seen since the collapse of regional lender Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.\n\nA decade in the making\n\nThe crypto industry has been waiting more than a decade for this moment.\n\nThe first application to create a spot bitcoin ETF came in 2013 from crypto entrepreneurs and twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, famous for their early role in the creation of Facebook. Since then, the SEC has denied more than 30 similar applications.\n\nEntrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who filed for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in 2013. (Lucas Jackson/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nA key turnaround moment came last year in June when the world\u2019s biggest money manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The interest from one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest names sparked other asset managers to follow suit.\n\nAnother important development came last August when one of the ETF applicants, Grayscale Investments, won a key legal victory over the SEC. Grayscale had sued the SEC in 2022 after it wasn't allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin offering.\n\nIts core argument was that the agency had already approved exchange-traded products that held bitcoin futures contracts and thus had \"acted arbitrarily and capriciously.\"\n\n\u200bA three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington sided with Grayscale, saying the firm had \"advanced substantial evidence\" its product was similar to bitcoin futures ETFs previously approved by the SEC.\n\nThat forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF application, along with others filed by rival money managers.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s first deadline to consider these various ETFs is Jan. 10 for a joint offering from Ark Invest and 21Shares. Other deadlines are as late as April.\n\nLet the race begin\n\nETF issuers and analysts say they believe the SEC will choose to approve all applications that pass muster by the earliest January deadline, so as not to give any first movers an advantage over the rest of the industry.\n\nOne of the applicants, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, told Yahoo Finance that the dominant providers of spot bitcoin ETFs will be those that take in the most money from investors right out of the gate.\n\nThe winners \"will be a few and it will be the most liquid,\" she said.\n\nCathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, is among the applicants seeking approval from the SEC to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. (Patrick T. FALLON / AFP) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)\n\nHistorically, launches for other bitcoin products have sent bitcoin\u2019s price on a wild ride.\n\nIt happened in 2017 with the launch of the country\u2019s first bitcoin futures contracts and then in 2021 with the SEC\u2019s approval of the country's first bitcoin futures ETFs. Prices soared and then fell by large amounts in the year following the launches.\n\nThis time around, \"there's good pent-up demand so you'll see good flows,\u201d Sandy Kaul, Franklin Templeton's head of digital assets, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"But I think that the transformative flows are really going to come in about six months to a year when people start to see what these ETFs actually offer in terms of the portfolio performance.\"\n\nWhat is clear, she added, is that the approval of these products would offer \"a real affirmation of the crypto ecosystem being a legitimate investment opportunity.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nThe price of bitcoin rose more than 150% in 2023. A prior version of this article incorrectly reported the rise was 164% through January 1.\n\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTs\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "In this issue of the Bloomberg Crypto newsletter, Michael P. Regan wonders what the SEC thinks about the huge role that Coinbase is poised to play in proposed spot-Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhen it comes to discussions about the US finally approving a spot-Bitcoin ETF or issuing more rejections, there\u2019s a gorilla in the room that few seem to be acknowledging: Coinbase Global Inc.\n\n\n\nThe largest US crypto exchange \u2013 and the only one that\u2019s a public company \u2013 is poised to play a major role as a middleman between the crypto market and the traditional equities market where the exchange-traded funds would trade.\n\n\n\nThe only twist? The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase in June, alleging that the company acted as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearinghouse without registering with the agency for any of those roles.\n\n\n\nAt the time, the company\u2019s chief legal officer said it would fight the SEC in court while simultaneously pushing for a legislative solution on crypto regulations that the company hoped would advance in the House of Representatives by the end of the summer. That didn\u2019t happen, of course, and anyone who\u2019s been paying attention to US politics knows Congress can barely agree on a lunch order \u2013 or even to keep the government open, for that matter -- let alone pass major legislation like that. There was even talk at the time that the legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC could end up in the Supreme Court, yet the case hasn\u2019t even gone to trial yet. And the US high court sort of has its hands full at the moment anyway with, you know, the whole future of American democracy and whatnot."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) traded just above $43,000 in European morning hours Thursday, recovering some losses after a leverage flush sent it down as much as 7% on Wednesday as markets reacted to analyst reports. Matrixport's out-of-consensus report served as a catalyst to unwind overleveraged positions leading to cascading liquidations, exacerbating the downfall. Nearly $560 million of leveraged long derivatives trading positions \u2013 bets on higher prices with borrowed money \u2013 had been wiped out through Wednesday, the highest amount in at least three months, CoinGlass data shows. CryptoQuant also attributed the decline to exceptionally high funding rates on the bitcoin futures market, adding selling pressure from bitcoin miners and high profit rates of short-term holders as contributing factors. Major tokens solana (SOL), ether (ETH) and Cardano\u2019s ADA started to stabilize early Thursday after dropping more than 10% in 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based gauge tracking the market, slumped 6% in the same period, its steepest drop in recent weeks."

The main reason, I wrote, is that crypto used to be a laboratory for rediscovering central intuitions about finance: Crypto was building a brand-new alternative financial system from scratch, and crypto enthusiasts were discovering solutions to financial problems for themselves. Sometimes those solutions were better than the traditional solutions, and sometimes they were worse, and sometimes they just used new terminology to re-describe solutions that traditional finance discovered years ago, but in any case they were fun to write about. Better, or worse, or the same, they provided a lens through which to see traditional finance; seeing why crypto did something, and why it did or didn\u2019t work, could help you understand why traditional finance does things the way it does."

Today is even Bitcoin\u2019s 15th birthday.\n\nThe US government should also be chuffed. Thanks to a healthy price rally, the Feds are now holding at least $8.3 billion in bitcoin \u2014 up from $5 billion less than three months ago.\n\nBetween November 2020 and 2022, authorities in three separate actions altogether disclosed seizing 207,189 bitcoin (BTC) tied to seminal dark web market Silk Road, its hacker Jimmy Zhong, as well as the hackers of crypto exchange Bitfinex.\n\nRead more: DOJ gets Silk Road coins worth $305M stuck in Bitcoin mempool\n\nLess than 5% of those hauls have been sold after officials offloaded 9,861 BTC once owned by Silk Road on Coinbase last February. The trades netted $215 million for $21,800 per bitcoin on average, about half the current price.\n\nUS attorneys at the time said they intended to sell the rest of Silk Road\u2019s bitcoin \u2014 41,491 BTC worth $1 billion then and $1.8 billion today \u2014 in four batches over the next calendar year, a period which expires in two months.\n\nThe US government has historically sold bitcoin way too early\n\nOnly one batch has been potentially processed so far, when the US Department of Justice sent 8,200 BTC ($252 million then, $350 million now) to Coinbase last July. But it\u2019s so far unconfirmed whether any trades actually took place.\n\nCounting those transactions as sales would mean the US has generated $640 million by seizing and selling bitcoin over the past decade.\n\nThe price of bitcoin has multiplied 70 times in that time. Had the US government opted to hold all its seized bitcoin, rather than sell it, the Feds would still have around 400,000 BTC ($17.4 billion), nearly double its current cache.\n\nMarkets could indeed see more Silk Road bitcoin dumped by the US government over the next couple of months. There\u2019s however no word yet on a timeline to sell the bitcoin seized from Bitfinex hackers Ilya \u201cDutch\u201d Lichtenstein and Heather \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d Morgan.\n\nToggle the chart to US dollars to see just how much the US has missed out on (figures rounded)\n\nIn any case, the US could have the largest government bitcoin stash in the world, according to at least one set of researchers last year. The US was found leagues ahead of El Salvador, Ukraine, Bhutan, Venezuela and Finland, which together hold only 4,000 BTC ($172 million).\n\nChina was left out of that particular paper. Beijing seized 195,000 BTC ($8.4 billion) from crypto Ponzi scheme PlusToken in 2020 alongside swathes of other cryptocurrencies, including ether (ETH) and XRP.\n\nIf Beijing hasn\u2019t sold too early like the US, that would put the two superpowers basically tied for bitcoin holdings.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Everything Crypto Investors Need to Know About Bitcoin ETFs and the SEC - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto world has been aflutter about a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for months now. It's been one of the main drivers in Bitcoin's (BTC) recent rally. In contrast, fears that the SEC might not grant the anticipated approvals caused Bitcoin to drop 8% in just a few hours this morning.\n\nSo what's all the fuss about? Read on to find out what's got people so excited about spot Bitcoin ETFs, why the SEC has hesitated to approve any up until now, and what it means for you as an investor.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nETFs, also known as exchange-traded funds, are baskets of securities that trade on the stock market. That could be stocks, bonds, real estates, or commodities. Think of it like buying shares in a company that owns and manages those assets. In this case, the ETF would contain Bitcoin and investors could get exposure to the lead cryptocurrency directly from their brokerage account.\n\nVarious groups, including ARK Investment, BlackRock, and Grayscale Investments have spot ETF applications in the pipeline. The SEC has rejected previous spot Bitcoin ETF proposals on fears of fraud and market manipulation. It's concerned there aren't enough investor protections in crypto. However, last year, a court ruled that it was wrong and the SEC did not challenge the decision.\n\nIn recent months, it's been in detailed discussions with various prospective ETF issuers, fueling speculation that we may soon see an approval. The SEC has until Jan. 10 to decide whether it will approve the initial applications. Several analysts believe it will happen before that. Others say the SEC might want more time, or reject the applications altogether.\n\nThe SEC approved a Bitcoin futures ETF a few years ago, but the spot ETF is a different kettle of fish. Futures are a type of derivative. If you own futures, you own a contract to buy or sell that asset at a certain price in the future. You don't actually own the asset. A spot Bitcoin ETF would hold Bitcoin rather than contracts to buy or sell the crypto.\n\nWhat a Bitcoin ETF might mean for crypto investors\n\nIf the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF it would mean people could buy Bitcoin without having to use a crypto exchange or broker. It won't solve all of crypto's issues, but being able to access Bitcoin from the stock market could remove one big hurdle for institutional and retail investors alike. It would make it safer and easier to buy and store Bitcoin.\n\nThe high-profile collapse of several top crypto exchanges highlighted the limited protections in the crypto world and severely dented investor confidence. Crypto assets do not have the same protections as securities in a brokerage account or cash in a bank. If you leave your cryptocurrency on an exchange, you may lose everything if that exchange fails or is hacked. While crypto investors can opt to store their Bitcoin in a crypto wallet, this takes knowledge and brings its own risks.\n\nIn contrast, shares in an ETF -- even a spot Bitcoin ETF -- would be held in a brokerage account and covered by SIPC insurance. SIPC stands for Securities Investor Protection Corporation and covers up to $500,000 of customer assets in the event your brokerage collapses.\n\nSIPC insurance does not protect against volatility or poor market performance. So if Bitcoin collapses completely, you would lose your investment whether you held Bitcoin in an ETF or any other form.\n\nWhat steps crypto investors might take\n\nFirst of all, try not to get tied up in the frenzy around a Bitcoin ETF. Speculation is rife in the cryptocurrency world, which can mean prices soar in the run up to big news events only to fall when the event actually happens. For example, Ethereum's (ETH) price dropped after its long anticipated merge to a more sustainable mining model.\n\nTake a step back and think about Bitcoin's long-term potential and how it might fit into your portfolio. Make sure you understand the risks involved. If the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF, that won't automatically make crypto safe. The industry is still relatively new and unregulated and there are a lot of questions about how it might unfold.\n\nFor example, we don't yet know what shape a U.S. regulatory framework will take. Some fear it could cripple this emerging industry while others believe it would give the industry stronger foundations from which to grow. A lot depends on the details, which have yet to be hammered out. But increased regulation will have an impact on crypto prices in the short term.\n\nIf you're considering buying Bitcoin for the first time, be prepared for volatility. Crypto fluctuates much more dramatically than the stock market, which can come as a shock. I've seen my crypto portfolio's value drop by around 50% in a matter of months, and it is unnerving to say the least. Make sure high-risk assets like crypto only make up a small percentage of your portfolio, and only invest money you can afford to lose.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF approval could change the crypto landscape, making it easier and safer to hold the granddaddy of crypto. However, don't assume it will solve all of crypto's issues. The volatility and regulatory challenges won't go away just because the SEC greenlights these ETFs, assuming it does grant the expected approvals."

        "title": "Bitcoin Layer 2s: What They Are and How They Work - Ledger",
        "content": "Bitcoin Layer 2s: What They Are and How They Work\n\nBy Mohammad Musharraf\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first, functional, and fully decentralized \u2018peer-to-peer (P2P) money\u2019, and now, the biggest blockchain by market capitalization.\n\n\n\n\u2014 To maximize security and decentralization, the network compromised scalability which has caused high fees and slow transaction times as more users joined the network.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Bitcoin Layer 2s aim to boost scalability while retaining the base layer\u2019s decentralization and security standard, unlocking a better user experience, and new avenues for Bitcoin-powered innovations.\n\nSince its inception in 2008, Bitcoin (BTC) has captured the attention of individuals, governments, and traditional finance institutions alike. As the first decentralized cryptocurrency and the largest blockchain by market share, Bitcoin\u2019s status as the flagship cryptocurrency is undeniable.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s growth has not been all smooth sailing, as the network\u2019s increased popularity has led to severe network congestion. At peak times, excessive fees and high wait times have made BTC unsuitable for small day-to-day transactions. These issues have laid bare the dire need for a scaling solution for Bitcoin to accommodate the increased pressure on the network.\n\nIn this article, you will learn about what Bitcoin Layer 2s are, how they work, their key use cases, and some of the leading Bitcoin Layer 2 networks today.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Layer 2?\n\nLayer 1 and Layer 2 are terms that help distinguish between different networks within a single blockchain ecosystem. A Layer-1 network \u2013 which can also be referred to as a \u201cparent chain\u201d or \u201cmainnet\u201d in different contexts \u2013 is the fundamental blockchain. By contrast, Layer 2 solutions are secondary networks built on top of Layer 1\u2019s architecture.\n\nThe purpose of a Layer 2 solution is to reduce the load on Layer 1 by bypassing its technical limitations while taking advantage of its strengths. Thus Bitcoin Layer 2s are networks that run on top of the main blockchain, primarily to increase its capacity to process transactions, but they can also increase usability in some other ways.\n\nThink of Bitcoin as a professor with too many exams to grade (transactions to process. A layer 2 blockchain is an effective teaching assistant that does a bulk of the work grading the papers, before returning them to the professor to be officially logged.\n\nIn the same way, Layer 2 processes transactions off-chain, before sending them back to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhy Do Bitcoin Layer 2s Matter?\n\nIncreasing Scalability\n\nThe Bitcoin network takes about 10 minutes to finalize a single set of transactions \u2013 only seven transactions per second (TPS) on average.\n\nThis clogs the network during peak traffic and spikes transaction fees. For instance, in April 2021, users paid over $62 per transaction. While this may not be an issue for large transactions, it quickly becomes impractical for micropayments and point-of-sale transactions.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, scaling the Bitcoin blockchain itself is effectively not an option, as this would require a trade-off in security or decentralization, per Vitalik Buterin\u2019s concept of the Blockchain Trilemma.\n\nIn essence, The Blockchain Trilemma is the idea that any blockchain network can only optimize for two out of three main pillars: decentralization, security, and speed/scalability. Therefore, as the Bitcoin network settled on the former two pillars, it had to compromise on scalability.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an issue when transaction volumes were low. But as more users worldwide adopted Bitcoin, the network\u2019s inability to scale caused performance bottlenecks. Users experienced this network congestion in the form of high fees and long transaction times\n\nBitcoin Layer 2s improve scalability by processing transactions off-chain to unburden the Layer 1.\n\nIncreasing Utility\n\nGiven its purpose as a digital currency, Bitcoin\u2019s design only caters to two specific use cases. Namely, it enables censorship-resistant, trustless P2P transactions, and it provides the tech stack for Bitcoin to remain a deflationary store of value.\n\nOf course, this limited core functionality is one of Bitcoin\u2019s key features, not a bug. It is part of what makes the network so robust and tamper-resistant.\n\nOn the other hand, this lack of functionality can make it difficult for developers to innovate and build upon Bitcoin\u2019s revolutionary technology stack by drastically expanding the functionality of the network, Bitcoin Layer 2s provide a viable way to unlock additional use cases. By utilizing Layer 2 networks, Bitcoin users can take advantage of web3 staples like smart contracts, DeFi services, and digital assets/NFTs\n\nSo that explains what benefits Layer 2s intend to offer Bitcoin users, but how exactly do they accomplish this?\n\nHow Do Bitcoin Layer 2s Work?\n\nWhile the overall purpose of Layer 2s is the same, they differ in the way they help the Bitcoin network process transactions\n\nState Channels\n\nThese are Layer 2 solutions that can help to enable users to bypass high transaction fees. In this method, users create end-to-end encrypted \u2018channels\u2019 to send and receive payments. These channels work as micro-ledgers that maintain records on all transactions that occur within them.\n\nState Channels keep all transactions within them off-chain, only reporting the opening and closing balance of participants to the main network when the channel closes. Thus, participants can make repeated transactions with individuals or businesses without having to pay high fees for every single transaction.\n\nRollup Chains\n\nBlockchain Rollups are a Layer 2 solution that takes numerous transactions off of Layer 1 onto a separate network, consolidates them into a single piece of data, and sends that single piece of data back to be added to Layer 1.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that there are two kinds of Blockchain rollups \u2013 Optimistic and ZK. In short, Optimistic rollups assume that all of the transactions bundled together are valid unless proven otherwise. In contrast, ZK rollups produce a single cryptographic proof called \u201cvalidity proof,\u201d which attests to the validity of the transactions bundled together.\n\nSidechains\n\nA sidechain is an independent blockchain with its own consensus mechanisms that connect to Layer 1 via a two-way bridge. This bridge is vital as it is what allows the transfer of assets between chains. Due to effectively being its blockchain, a sidechain can support other Layer 2 solutions on top of it.\n\nTop Bitcoin Layer 2s\n\nInnovators and developers in the Bitcoin ecosystem have developed several Layer 2 solutions over the years, exploring the concepts and avenues discussed so far.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of some of the best and most popular Bitcoin Layer 2s as of November 2023.\n\nThe Lightning Network\n\nLaunched in 2018, the Lightning Network uses \u2018state channels\u2019 to enable microtransactions on top of the Bitcoin Layer-1.\n\nTo use the Lightning Network, participants send and receive BTC payments through encrypted P2P channels that are essentially smart contracts. To illustrate, to send 0.1 BTC to your friend, , you\u2019d create a channel with them and fund it with the required amount. And once all the transactions are complete, you can close the channel. The system stays efficient by only sending the channel\u2019s opening and closing balances to the Bitcoin network.\n\nRootstock (RSK)\n\nRootstock (RSK) is a sidechain that pioneered smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. It works through something called a two-way peg. To explain, when a user sends Bitcoin to Rootsock, it becomes a locked-up, smart Bitcoin on Rootsock (RBTC) in the user\u2019s RSK wallet. Sending RBTC in the other direction allows the user to withdraw their Bitcoin from the regular network.\n\nRootstock claims to be able to process up to 300 TPS this way, a drastic improvement in Bitcoin\u2019s transaction speed. The platform is also notable for its compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). To clarify, EVM is a virtual computer responsible for executing smart contracts and updating the state of the Ethereum blockchain. In other words, Rootstock boasts compatibility with the entire ecosystem of Ethereum dApps.\n\nStacks Protocol\n\nStacks has become one of the top-performing Bitcoin L2s since going live on the mainnet in 2018 as Blockstack. The protocol enables self-executing smart contracts that you can deploy over Bitcoin without implementing a fork. To do this, the protocol uses microblocks for speed and a unique Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) mechanism to tie them to blocks on Layer 1. It provides an accessible, easy-to-use, plug-and-play method for running smart contracts and decentralized applications within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nLiquid Network\n\nLiquid Network is a Bitcoin Layer 2 sidechain that runs on the open-source Elements blockchain platform. The network has its own native asset, Liquid (L-BTC), and is governed by a distributed federation of Bitcoin companies, exchanges, and other stakeholders.\n\nMuch like Rootstock, the Liquid Network uses a two-way peg to convert BTC to L-BTC and vice versa.\n\nRisks of Using Bitcoin Layer 2s\n\nAlthough most existing Layer 2s inherit a high degree of security and reliability, they are not as battle-tested as Bitcoin yet when it comes to robustness. As somewhat independent networks, they introduce a new set of risks and challenges.\n\nFor example, in 2022, Lightning users experienced a unique \u2018unattributed payment routing\u2019 failure due to a bug. They ended up interacting with faulty nodes as a result, without being aware of the problem for a long time.\n\nMoreover, Federated sidechains like the Liquid Network are still in their nascent stages of development and market adoption. Unlike Bitcoin, which has 1000s of miners worldwide, they have much fewer nodes (15, in Liquid\u2019s case) signing and confirming transactions. That is to say that Bitcoin Layer 2s can often be more centralized than the main network.\n\nBTC Layer 2s: A New Way to Explore Bitcoin\n\nLayer 2 solutions take all the revolutionary benefits of Bitcoin technology and build upon it, drastically improving the network\u2019s transaction processing capabilities. Though they certainly aren\u2019t a perfect solution, they do address the problem at hand while retaining the decentralized security that has been instrumental to Bitcoin\u2019s proliferation.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? The exciting world of Bitcoin Layer 2s is waiting to be explored. Thanks to Ledger Live, it\u2019s never been easier to explore all that Bitcoin Layer 2 networks have to offer. As always, the industry-leading security of the Ledger ecosystem means that you can safely store your own private keys and have full access to both your Bitcoin and Layer 2 native tokens. Not to mention that you can now create an account on Stacks Protocol, directly from Ledger Live."

        "content": "A series of meetings between the Securities and Exchange Commission and a handful of stock exchanges are fueling confidence that the approval of a long-awaited spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund could be imminent.\n\nFOX Business has learned that SEC staff attorneys from the Division of Trading and Markets are meeting Wednesday with officials from the major exchanges \u2014 the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange \u2014 where the ETFs would trade.\n\nThe meetings are seen as a positive sign that the SEC is nearing approval of some or all of the dozen applications by major money managers and crypto firms for the product, according to people at the firms who asked not to be quoted by name. Specifically, the SEC is asking the exchanges to revise and finalize their so-called 19b-4 filings, submitted by the exchanges on behalf of issuers, which must receive SEC clearance before the ETF can be sold to the public.\n\nSEC HOLDS CALLS WITH SPOT BITCOIN ETF HOPEFULS AS POSSIBLE APPROVAL NEARS\n\nWhile the final decision has not been made, sources close to the proceedings say the SEC could begin notifying issuers of approval on Friday with trading beginning as early as next week. ETF analysts and issuers alike remain confident that a favorable decision from the SEC will be made on or before Jan. 10, as the SEC continues to meet with key players on the matter.\n\nOf course, the SEC could deny the applications. Hours before FOX Business reported on Wednesday\u2019s meetings, Singapore-based crypto platform Matrixport released a research note stating it expects the SEC to reject all spot bitcoin ETF applications, citing the Democrat majority on the agency\u2019s five-member commission and Chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s reluctance to embrace crypto.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell by more than 7% on the heels of that report after exceeding close to a two-year high of $45,000 on New Year\u2019s Day in anticipation of a spot ETF approval.\n\n\"Broadly speaking, if the Commission declares a registration statement effective, that is reflected on EDGAR,\" an SEC spokesperson told FOX Business. \"Any Commission 19b-4 orders will be posted on our website and then published in the Federal Register.\"\n\nPress officials from the NYSE, Nasdaq and CBOE didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nVALKYRIE INVESTMENTS FIRST TO OFFER ETHER FUTURES THROUGH ETF\n\nIf approval does occur, retail investors would gain greater exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency at less cost than the already approved bitcoin futures ETF.\n\nPurchasing an ETF through highly regulated and trusted money management firms such as BlackRock or Fidelity may also encourage a larger pool of investors to add cryptocurrency to their portfolios."

BLK are planning to launch.\n\nApart from GS, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM is being considered as a potential AP for the ETF. This was first reported by Coindesk.\n\nBLK became the first asset manager to file for the spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023, paving the way for a wave of filings by other asset managers like Fidelity, Invesco and WisdomTree, Inc. WT.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to announce its decision on the trading of spot bitcoin ETF\u2019s latest by Jan 10, 2024. To date, the approved cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States are those that include future contracts on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The pending approval from SEC will provide investors direct exposure to the price of cryptocurrency without having to purchase them.\n\nBlackRock also filed for a spot Ethereum ETF named iShares Ethereum Trust in November 2023. The Ethereum ETF, if approved, will be the first of its kind in the United States.\n\nWhile BLK is expanding its cryptocurrency exposure, JPM has been undertaking measures to subdue them. In September 2023, JPM stated that its retail bank, Chase, in the U.K. had decided to restrict customers\u2019 access to cryptocurrency-related transactions due to increased scams and fraud cases. Nonetheless, it has been exploring the concept of launching a blockchain-based deposit token for customers, provided it receives the required regulatory approval.\n\nJPMorgan and Goldman as APs for spot Bitcoin ETF would be entrusted with the responsibility of tracking the ETF share price with underlying assets of fund. The companies will be required to create and redeem the shares of ETF, thus supplying the required liquidity.\n\nBeside this, Goldman has been focusing on growth in its core strengths of investment banking and trading since it has been pulling back from its consumer lending business. Such growth moves by GS are necessary to support its top-line expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nPer an internal memo circulated last year, GS had disclosed changes in its senior executives\u2019 positions as it intended to expand its operations in the private credit space. It further aims to double the size of business targeting assets worth $110 billion under management over the medium term.\n\nFurther, it has been aiming to expand its offerings across the high growth countries. In December 2023, Bloomberg reported that GS was planning to enhance its credit business in India as it is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Per Sonjoy Chatterjee, chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman in India, the bank intends to broaden the range of its loan offerings in this country.\n\nThe firm also desires to obtain a license to boost its currency trading that would permit it to deal with counterparties like financial investors, equity customers or a corporate customer. This apart, GS believes that deal-making activity in the country is likely to receive a boost.\n\nGoldman\u2019s shares have gained 16.9% over the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s 11.3% growth.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGS presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply from $44,700 to $43,200 after its strong recovery from the flash crash on January 3.\n\nSome analysts have cautioned against getting too excited, saying that approval is more likely to come next week. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart described the speculation around a January 5 approval as \"noise\" and said he still expects approval to arrive between January 8 and January 10.\n\nSenior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says the SEC is currently providing final comments and that issuers will soon file their final 19b-4 and S-1 forms soon afterward. Both forms need to be approved by the SEC before an ETF can start trading, though an approved 19b-4 form is required for the spot Bitcoin ETF to be effectively approved.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF will be the first in the United States, making its potential approval highly anticipated by crypto market investors and traders. There are a total of 14 issuers applying for a spot Bitcoin ETF, including BlackRock, Valkyrie, ARK Invest & 21 Shares, Bitwise and Fidelity.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Thursday, recovering some of its losses from the previous day, when the cryptocurrency sold off on concerns about the potential of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval that many expect as soon as next week.\n\nThe flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by about 3% at $43,870.01, according to Coin Metrics. On Wednesday it fell as much as 6% as short-term traders speculated that a bitcoin ETF would not be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and liquidated overleveraged positions.\n\n\"This bitcoin bounce comes after a healthy wipeout of leveraged positions,\" said Sam Callahan, lead analyst at bitcoin services firm Swan Bitcoin. \"The bounce is likely related to investors positioning themselves for the imminent approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could be a large catalyst for bitcoin's price in 2024 and for many years to come.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin Spot Vs Futures ETFs: What's the Difference? - Ledger",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spot Vs Futures ETFs: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nBy Gaurav Roy\n\nRead 8 min Beginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument that allows investors to gain exposure to a group of assets.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Though some types of ETFs exist for Bitcoin, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has never approved a Spot ETF \u2013 an ETF that specifically tracks the current market price of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Should the SEC approve one or more of the existing Bitcoin Spot ETF applications after the January 10th deadline, it would be a major milestone for Bitcoin, as many expect the existence of a Bitcoin Spot ETF to boost Bitcoin adoption in the traditional finance sector.\n\nIn June 2023, Blackrock \u2013 the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2013 shook up the world of cryptocurrency when it applied with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\nSince then, at least 12 other notable financial institutions have filed applications for their own Bitcoin Spot ETFs, including firms such as Grayscale Investments, Fidelity, and Invesco. The months following the news have seen Bitcoin\u2019s price resurge, from hovering around $26,000 in June, to close to around $45,000 as of the first week of January 2024.\n\nWhile there are some Bitcoin ETFs currently available in the US market, there are key differences between those and a potential Bitcoin Spot ETF. This article will clarify the difference between a Bitcoin Futures ETF and a Bitcoin Spot ETF to help you understand the advantages, disadvantages, and key features of both, as well as explain why they are important for the future of Bitcoin and crypto at large.\n\nWhat is an ETF?\n\nAn Exchange-Traded Fund, or ETF, is a kind of financial instrument. Specifically, an ETF is a pooled investment fund that is tradeable on an exchange, hence the name. Think of an ETF as a single group of investments (stocks, bonds, etc) that tracks the performance of a group of assets. This allows an investor to gain exposure to certain kinds of assets, without having to trade individual assets.\n\nAs an example, take the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI). This is an ETF that effectively tracks how the overall US stock market is doing. If an investor believed that the stock market as a whole was going to rise, they could buy shares of this ETF rather than individual stocks. This can save investors a ton on fees, while keeping their investment portfolios diverse, thus mitigating risk.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF, as you might imagine, is an ETF that tracks the price of Bitcoin (BTC). In other words, when you invest in a Bitcoin ETF, you\u2019re basically betting on whether Bitcoin\u2019s price will rise or fall.\n\nBitcoin ETFs make it possible to get exposure to Bitcoin without actually having to buy it directly. This could be particularly advantageous to investors who are interested in Bitcoin but have previously abstained from buying, due to its questionable regulatory status and/or the complexity of buying Bitcoin and storing it securely.\n\nIn the U.S., you can already invest in what is called a Bitcoin Futures ETF. This class of ETF essentially allows investors to bet on the future price of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin Spot ETF would work differently, however, as it would instead focus on the current price of Bitcoin. This might not seem like an important distinction, but it is very significant for investors, which is why these Bitcoin Spot ETF applications have drummed up so much excitement in recent months.\n\nSo what exactly is the difference between the two kinds of ETF, how do they work, and what makes a Spot ETF a bigger deal than a Futures ETF to many investors?\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Futures ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin Futures ETF tracks the price of Bitcoin futures contracts. To explain, a Bitcoin futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell BTC at a predefined price, at a later date. If more people expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise, the value of the contract could be higher than BTC\u2019s spot price. On the other hand, if more people are betting on the price of BTC to fall, the value of the futures contract could be lower than the spot price.\n\nNotably, the prices of bitcoin futures and the market price of Bitcoin tend to diverge based on the prevailing settlement of futures traders. In other words, if more people expect Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise, the value of the contract could be higher than BTC\u2019s real-time price on crypto markets. On the other hand, if more people are betting on the price of BTC to fall, the value of the futures contract could be lower than the market price.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF became the first Bitcoin Futures ETF available in the US with its launch in October 2021. Other major Bitcoin Futures ETFs include those from VanEck and Valkyrie.\n\nAdvantages of a Bitcoin Futures ETF\n\nEliminates self-custody concerns\n\nBitcoin Futures ETFs give traders a degree of exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s price movements without having to buy or manage the actual cryptocurrency. This means that the trader doesn\u2019t have to concern themselves with opening accounts on exchanges or securing their crypto assets.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, these products operate within a regulated environment, meaning they adhere to the standards set by financial regulatory bodies.\n\nEnables speculation on future price movements\n\nAs this kind of ETF invests in Bitcoin futures contracts, it allows investors to speculate on the future price movements of Bitcoin without ever having to own it directly.\n\nDisadvantages of a Bitcoin Futures ETF\n\nLess direct exposure\n\nThe biggest drawback of a Bitcoin futures ETF is that the fund issuing the ETF does not hold Bitcoin directly. Rather, the fund holds positions in the Bitcoin futures market. This means that investors in a Bitcoin Futures ETF merely own shares in a fund that invests in Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nNot only might this make a futures ETF unappealing to those wanting direct exposure to Bitcoin, it also introduces counterparty risk. To clarify, because a Bitcoin futures contract is an agreement to trade Bitcoin at a later date, it is possible that when that time comes, the buyer or seller may fail to uphold their end of the deal.\n\nPrice divergence\n\nAdditionally, because the price of futures can diverge from the spot price, it can adversely affect the performance of the ETF. That is to say that the ETF may not always move in tandem with the price of BTC.\n\nReduced returns due to fees\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of additional management fees that could reduce your returns. This may make owning a Bitcoin Futures ETF more expensive than simply trading Bitcoin futures on a crypto exchange.\n\nFor some investors, these drawbacks have made investing in a Bitcoin futures ETF untenable. This is partly why there is so much excitement for a potential spot Bitcoin ETF which, as you will see, offers much more direct exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Spot ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin Spot ETF aims to track Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cspot\u201d price. Basically, the spot price of an asset is the real-time price it is trading for in the marketplace. So, in effect, a Bitcoin Spot will be worth exactly what Bitcoin is trading for in crypto markets.\n\nA Bitcoin Spot ETF holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This means that, in contrast to a futures ETF, the fund manager who provides the ETF actually owns and manages a large pool of BTC. To do this, the fund may collaborate with a third-party crypto custodian to manage the asset securely.\n\nAll that is to say, when you buy shares in a Bitcoin Spot ETF, you\u2019re essentially buying a slice of actual Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency yourself.\n\nAs mentioned previously, there are currently no Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the US market. However, they do exist in other countries. For example, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have existed on the Canadian Stock Exchange for years.\n\nSince Blackrock launched its application, at least 12 other applications have come under SEC review. These applications \u2013 Blackrock\u2019s in particular \u2013 have garnered widespread attention in the crypto world for a few reasons.\n\nWhile the SEC has so far rejected all applications for cryptocurrency spot ETFs due to concerns over market manipulation, Blackrock has had an astounding 575 ETFs approved by the SEC. To date, only one of their applications has ever been denied.\n\nThe fact that an institution with the record and reputation of Blackrock is putting its weight behind Bitcoin Spot ETFs has many proponents confident that at least one if not several Bitcoin Spot ETFs will be approved by the SEC\u2019s deadline of January 10th, 2024\n\nAdvantages of a Bitcoin Spot ETF\n\nThere are several reasons why the cryptocurrency industry has been a big proponent of a Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\nDirect price tracking\n\nA spot ETF invests in Bitcoin at its spot price, meaning the fund holds BTC and directly tracks the price of the digital asset. This means the price of the ETF keeps in line with the actual BTC price.\n\nSimple On-Ramp\n\nBitcoin Spot ETFs allow institutional and individual traders to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually buying Bitcoin themselves. Thus, it eliminates the process of signing up for an exchange and dealing with crypto wallets.\n\nNo self-custody concerns\n\nAs a Bitcoin Spot ETF circumvents the need to buy Bitcoin directly, investors can avoid the complexities of self-custody, such as understanding private keys and crypto wallets and storing your seed phrase. Securing crypto is a big responsibility, and some people prefer an approach that doesn\u2019t require them to learn the ins and outs.\n\nRegulated environment\n\nAny approved Bitcoin Spot ETF would be regulated, meaning that both the ETF and the fund behind it are audited to ensure they operate fairly. For traders accustomed to the regulations of traditional finance (TradFi), this can be reassuring.\n\nDisadvantages of a Bitcoin Spot ETF\n\nPrice Fluctuation\n\nThe value of a Bitcoin Spot ETF fluctuates with the price of Bitcoin and, therefore, shares its potential to be volatile.\n\nMoreover, and in contrast to the crypto market being open 24/7, financial exchanges have rigid trading hours and don\u2019t operate during weekends or through the night. This means that if there is considerable movement in BTC\u2019s price overnight, Bitcoin Spot ETF investors cannot act on that price movement until the market re-opens.\n\nFees Involved\n\nETFs are more costly than buying Bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges. This is because of the management fees the fund manager charges. This fee, which is baked into the fund, could be as high as 2.5%, compared to crypto spot trading fees that are usually much lower.\n\nNo Actual Ownership\n\nWhen trading a Bitcoin Spot ETF, you do not own the asset but merely gain exposure to the underlying asset\u2019s price. That\u2019s it. This might not be an issue for institutional investors, but it certainly goes against the concept of self-custody that is important to so many Bitcoin proponents.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Crypto ETFs\n\nAll things considered, an approval of any Bitcoin spot ETFs would be a momentous occasion for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large. Indeed, many view this step as a kind of stamp of approval of Bitcoin by the world\u2019s most powerful financial regulatory board, the SEC. After all, the mere talk of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval is what most pundits point to when discussing the notable resurgence of Bitcoin\u2019s price in recent months.\n\nTo many long-time proponents, a Bitcoin spot ETF could be a watershed moment, bringing countless new people and traditional investors into the fold. And of course, with more investors and interest comes additional liquidity. That\u2019s why the approval of these ETFs is so important. Simply, it could signify a change in the market, allowing more new people to enter the ecosystem than ever before. Spot ETFs further the potential for the market to grow: supporting the mass adoption of crypto and blockchain technology.\n\nOf course, if you too are excited about the future of Bitcoin, you don\u2019t have to wait on the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF. Thanks to Ledger\u2019s ecosystem of devices and software, and vast library of educational resources, taking the steps to buy Bitcoin yourself and safely store your private keys has never been easier.\n\nTo be sure, investing in a Bitcoin spot ETF could be a great, low-friction way to start your journey. But when you understand the true benefits of crypto and why it exists, nothing beats the sovereignty and individual agency that comes with self-custody. When you\u2019re ready to take the leap, Ledger devices are here to help ensure that only you can access your Bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin Flash Crashes to $40,750, Causes Over Half a Billion in Long Liquidations\n\nOn Wednesday morning Eastern Time, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sudden crash in a matter of minutes, as the price of Bitcoin dropped from around $45,132 to as low as $40,750, erasing gains seen in the past week.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin's price has fallen by almost 9.5% in an abrupt flash crash. The crash resulted in the liquidation of over $595 million in crypto long positions in the past 24 hours, including $137 million in Bitcoin longs in the past hour alone, as per data from CoinGlass.\n\nAltcoins also suffered sudden losses alongside Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH) plunged by 10.9%, while Solana (SOL) crashed by over 20% during the flash crash. However, Bitcoin and altcoins have subsequently recovered from the lows.\n\nIn a research note for clients released on January 3 titled \u201cWhy the SEC will REJECT Bitcoin Spot ETFs again,\u201d Matrixport\u2019s Head of Research Markus Thielen argued that the SEC would likely reject all applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF in January, contradicting its earlier stance on January 2 that the approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs \u201ccould be announced today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe price slump comes as the crypto market awaits the SEC's decision on whether to approve multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the coming days. Some analysts speculate that the decision could trigger a \"sell-the-news\" event. The reasons for the sudden sell-off are still unclear, but it could be related to profit-taking ahead of the SEC's decision, uncertainty in the broader financial markets, or a combination of factors.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "From The Markets First Bitcoin Depositary Receipt Launches\n\nReceipts Depositary Corporation (RDC) announced the launch of the first ever Bitcoin depositary receipt (BTC DR). RDC expects to issue the first BTC DRs in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) in the coming weeks. BTC DRs are now available on an ongoing basis for issuance to QIBs.\n\nA DTC-ELIGIBLE BITCOIN SECURITY\n\nBTC DRs follow the same construction as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), and like ADRs, BTC DRs operate within US-regulated market infrastructure and are cleared through The Depository Trust Company (DTC). BTC DRs have been issued a CUSIP number and an ISIN.\n\nAN ESTABLISHED, REGULATED FINANCIAL PRODUCT\n\nThe first ADR was created in 1927. Today, ADRs are used by over 6,500 global financial institutions, including multinational banks, brokers and hedge funds. These institutional investors collectively own over $1 trillion in traditional DR securities and use them to invest in, transact, clear and settle foreign assets in the United States as easily as domestic securities. BTC DRs enable QIBs to own Bitcoin using the same technology, workflows and counterparty relationships they use for traditional securities by leveraging their standard transaction, custody and settlement operations.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to provide qualified institutional buyers with the secure, regulated access to digital assets they have been waiting for via BTC DRs,\u201d said Ankit Mehta, Co-Founder and CEO of RDC. \u201cThere are many benefits to using depositary receipts, such as their tried and true structure, providing direct ownership of the underlying asset and easy inclusion in institutional products. BTC DRs are universally fungible as QIBs can convert their Bitcoin holdings into DRs and vice versa.\u201d\n\n\u201cDepositary receipts are a simple solution to complex access problems for institutional investors,\u201d said Matthew Taback, Senior Market Maker, GTS.\n\nDIRECT OWNERSHIP OF BITCOIN THROUGH AN SEC-REGULATED TRANSFER AGENT AND OCC-REGULATED CUSTODIAN\n\nBroadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC is serving as RDC\u2019s SEC-registered transfer agent and Anchorage Digital Bank National Association, the first and only OCC-regulated and federally chartered digital asset bank, will provide custody in a bankruptcy remote structure. All Bitcoin represented by BTC DRs will be held at the custodian for the exclusive benefit of the BTC DR holders.\n\nRDC\u2019s model requires that all BTC DRs are 100% backed by Bitcoin held in custody, which cannot be lent, re-hypothecated, or pledged. BTC DRs enable direct ownership of the underlying asset, are fully fungible and represent a direct claim on Bitcoin held in custody, while mitigating counterparty credit risk from the issuing depositary. BTC DRs leverage existing workflows and use the existing securities ecosystem to provide robust risk management and asset protection.\n\nDRs CAN BE USED FOR DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL ASSETS\n\nBTC DRs are RDC\u2019s first offering, but RDC is available to create clearinghouse-eligible securities for other alternative assets. The company\u2019s three founders, Ankit Mehta, Bryant Kim and Ishaan Narain, each spent nearly a decade at a leading DR business, where they worked closely with issuers and investors to evolve DR market structure.\n\n\u201cThe RDC team has some of the strongest talent available in the highly technical world of depositary receipts,\u201d said Diogo M\u00f3nica, president and co-founder, Anchorage Digital. \u201cThey know the market extremely well and had the vision and ability to bring a well-established financial product to digital assets. And, with the underlying BTC safely stored via institutional-grade custody at Anchorage Digital Bank, we\u2019re excited to help bring BTC to the securities ecosystem.\u201d\n\nSource: Receipts Depositary Corporation"

        "content": "Crypto investment firm Matrixport said in a report the SEC will reject applications for spot bitcoin ETFs this month.\n\nThe firm doesn't anticipate approval until at least the second quarter of 2024\n\nThe market has been expecting approval, and regulators' rejection could crash prices by 20%.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCryptocurrency players have been expecting the US Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a slate of spot bitcoin ETFs in January, but one crypto firm isn't so optimistic.\n\nIn a report published Tuesday, Matrixport said the SEC is poised to reject applications for spot bitcoin ETFs this month, and new products won't get the green light until at least the second quarter of 2024. Such a rejection would come as a surprise to the market, and it could result in a steep crash in bitcoin's price.\n\n\"While we have seen frequent meetings between the ETF applicants and staff from the SEC, which resulted in the applicants refiling their applications, we believe all applications fall short of a critical requirement that must be met before the SEC approves,\" the research firm said.\n\n\"We could see Bitcoin prices declining by -20% very quickly and falling back to the $36,000/$38,000 range,\" Matrixport added. The researchers forecast that a denial from the SEC could spark \"cascading liquidations,\" and most of the $5.1 billion in perpetual long bitcoin futures could unwind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey note that SEC Chair Gary Gensler hasn't embraced cryptocurrency, and he still sees a long road ahead for the industry to mature.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF, market experts say, would accelerate crypto's development.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, Matrixport said Gensler and the Democrat-heavy group of voting Commissioners are unlikely to want to legitimize bitcoin as a store of value.\n\nOf the $14 billion of extra fiat and leverage that's been deployed into crypto since September, researchers estimate that $10 billion of that could be tied to hopes for a spot bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStefan Rust, the chief executive of economic data firm Truflation, echoed Matrixport's prediction that the government isn't ready to green-light a spot bitcoin ETF \u2013 especially if it entails giving multiple providers simultaneous approval.\n\n\"Governments and regulators haven't yet identified how they can exert control over cryptocurrencies,\" Rust said in a note Wednesday. \"No doubt they are looking for more time and choke points to inhibit access to cryptocurrencies from a decentralized system.\"\n\nTo Matrixport, if regulators do not hand down any approvals by January 5, traders should hedge their long exposure by buying $40,000 strike puts for the end of the month, or even shorting bitcoin via options.\n\nThat said, should the SEC deny applications for spot bitcoin ETFs, Matrixport expects bitcoin prices to still end the year higher than $42,000, given bullish tailwinds including the US election and developments in bitcoin mining such as this year's halving event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin climbed more than 150% in 2023. On Wednesday, the token was down by 5%, trading around $43,780."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -7.01%) had a tremendous year in 2023, soaring 154%. This gain matches what some \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks were able to do.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin still remains 35% below its peak price. So there is a lot of room to go to regain a new high.\n\nAs of early January, the price sat at roughly $45,000. But bullish investors have their sights set on a major milestone: the $100,000 mark. Can the world's top cryptocurrency reach this six-figure sum?\n\nMultiple catalysts to benefit from\n\nIt's easy to be optimistic that Bitcoin's price will rise 122%, even within the next 12 to 24 months. There are numerous catalysts the digital asset can benefit from.\n\nAbout every four years, Bitcoin's blockchain undergoes what is arguably the most bullish event for this cryptocurrency. The so-called \"halving,\" set to take place in April, is when the reward that miners receive for processing transactions gets cut in half, thus reducing the new supply of Bitcoin hitting the market. When you add this to steadily rising demand over time, the recipe for strong price gains is there.\n\nHistorically, the months before and after a halving have seen Bitcoin post huge growth. Based on the price performance in 2023, investor enthusiasm is already there.\n\nAnother catalyst would be the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). There are a number of asset management firms vying to introduce this product to the market. Some experts believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve these ETFs this month.\n\nSome investors, whether individuals or institutions, might still be skeptical about buying Bitcoin directly. They could be worried about how to custody it, or about the uncertain regulatory outlook.\n\nHowever, if spot Bitcoin ETFs become a reality, I think it would make this crypto a legitimate financial asset with the government's stamp of approval. The result could be that huge sums of capital flow into Bitcoin, demand that can support a higher price.\n\nWhile both the halving and the approval of a spot ETF capture the minds of investors, there's an under-the-radar catalyst that could propel Bitcoin.\n\nAnd this is the reversal of the Fed's tighter monetary stance. Inflation has shown signs of cooling over the past several months. And with it getting more under control, the central bank could institute rate cuts throughout the course of 2024. This would be a welcome sign, especially for risky assets.\n\nIf the Fed adopts looser monetary policy, economic activity could begin to pick up. And more capital can flow toward various asset classes, particularly those further out on the risk spectrum. Plus, Bitcoin could benefit from its continuing media coverage.\n\nMaintain a long-term focus\n\nI think there's a very high probability Bitcoin could reach the $100,000 mark within the next three years. I also wouldn't be shocked if the crypto hit that figure by the end of 2024. There are just so many positive developments working in its favor right now.\n\nDespite the reasons to be optimistic, investors must always keep their sights set on the long term. Anything can happen in a given month, quarter, or year. And the last thing you want to do is panic at the absolute worst time and sell your Bitcoin holdings.\n\nInstead, aim to grow your knowledge about Bitcoin, gaining greater conviction in the process. And don't be discouraged if your portfolio doesn't immediately register monster gains. This is an asset that should be held with a time horizon of five to 10 years, at least."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) creator Satoshi Nakamoto is assumed to hold around 1.1 million BTC, worth $46 billion today. This means the world\u2019s richest person and first trillionaire might not be Elon Musk if Bitcoin ever reaches the high six-figure range.\n\nMeanwhile, other prominent Bitcoin holders have also made billions from the rise in BTC price over the past 15 years. One of the most notable examples is MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor, who is up a whopping $2.6 billion on his Bitcoin investment.\n\nCan a Bitcoin billionaire dethrone Musk?\n\nSo, how high would BTC\u2019s price be for a Bitcoin billionaire such as Saylor to become the world\u2019s richest person?\n\nMicroStrategy vs. Tesla stock price (1-year chart). Source: TradingView\n\nSeveral factors must be considered to explore the possibility of Saylor overtaking Musk as the wealthiest person in the world with Bitcoin prices rising \u2014 namely, Saylor\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings and Musk\u2019s net worth, excluding his own possible Bitcoin and (likely) Dogecoin (DOGE) stacks for this theoretical exercise.\n\nRelated: Michael Saylor begins selling $216M in MicroStrategy stocks for more Bitcoin\n\nThe latest data shows that Saylor\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings amount to 206,882 BTC (around $9 billion), including MicroStrategy\u2019s 189,150 BTC and his own stash of 17,732 BTC, according to Forbes. Musk\u2019s net worth, on the other hand, is approximately $219 billion.\n\nTo calculate the Bitcoin price necessary for Saylor\u2019s net worth to surpass Musk\u2019s, we need to find the price per Bitcoin that would value Saylor\u2019s holdings past $219 billion.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the calculation, which can be done using Cointelegraph\u2019s price calculator:\n\nSaylor\u2019s personal Bitcoin holdings: 17,732 BTC MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings: 189,150 BTC Total Bitcoin holdings: 17,732 BTC (personal) + 189,150 (company) = 206,882 BTC (around $9 billion) Musk\u2019s net worth: around $219 billion\n\nWe can now calculate the required price of Bitcoin for this scenario.\n\nSeven-figure Bitcoin price\n\nTo surpass Musk\u2019s net worth of approximately $219 billion, the price of a single Bitcoin would need to reach approximately $1,054,000. This is a substantial 24x increase from current Bitcoin prices, but it would nevertheless align with numerous price predictions. At the same time, this reflects the remaining big gap in net worth between the two entrepreneurs.\n\nRelated: Ex-BitMEX CEO explains how Bitcoin will have hit $1 million by 2030\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this scenario is hypothetical and depends on various factors, including Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics, Musk\u2019s fluctuating net worth (largely tied to his holdings in companies like Tesla and SpaceX), and Saylor maintaining his Bitcoin holdings.\n\nAdditionally, such a dramatic rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price would likely have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market and global financial systems.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The unanticipated slide is seen as an outcome of jitters around the expected approval of a spot bitcoin ETF. The fall has wiped off most of the gains that took place on Jan 1 which led to the liquidation of $500 million of positions across derivatives exchanges. Ironically, the massive slide coincides with the release of a new video by ETF applicants Galaxy and Invesco commemorating bitcoin's birthday.\n\nWhat led to the fall?\n\nExperts point out that there are several reasons for the fall, which include the lower likelihood of passage of ETF, decline in stocks of companies which deal in the mining off cryptos and the rising sell-offs.\n\nOne user Greeks.live wrote on X Platform, \u201cThe likelihood of the ETF's passage became less and less likely, and the market saw a stalemate. Weakness in crypto mining stocks, and the sell-off in several crypto-related U.S. stocks, also reinforced the market's skepticism.\"\n\nOther crypto tokens also followed suit with Ethereum losing 6.91 percent to trade at $2,228, Solana fell 12 percent, ripple lost 13 percent of its value and Cardano fell over 10 percent in the past 24 hours.\n\nIt is vital to mention here that bitcoin ETF was expected to be approved as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday, Reuters had reported citing sources.\n\nConversely, financial services firm Matrixport rebuffed the optimism in a report.\n\n\"From a political perspective, there is no reason to approve a bitcoin spot ETF that would legitimize bitcoin as an alternative store of value,\" the report reads.\n\n\u201cWhile we have seen frequent meetings between the ETF applicants and staff from the SEC, which resulted in the applicants refilling their applications, we believe all applications fall short of a critical requirement that must be met before the SEC approves. This might be fulfilled by Q2 2024, but we expect the SEC to reject all proposals in January,\" the report further adds.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Hand Over Fist in January - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a huge rally in the crypto market in 2023, it's perhaps no surprise that many investors are now expecting a similar type of performance in 2024. While past performance is certainly no guarantee of future performance, there is definitely room for optimism as we enter the New Year.\n\nIn terms of overall growth prospects and the potential to skyrocket higher in 2024, Bitcoin (BTC -7.83%) and Solana (SOL 3.83%) particularly stand out. Here's a closer look.\n\nBitcoin\n\nIt's almost impossible to talk about the 2023 crypto market rally without also mentioning Bitcoin. For the year, Bitcoin was up more than 150%. Bitcoin recently topped $45,000, and is now trading at its highest levels since April 2022.\n\nThe key catalyst, of course, is the imminent launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market. There are now more than a dozen Wall Street firms that have submitted applications to the SEC, and regulatory approval of at least one of these is almost a certainty at this point. The new ETF potentially means new money flooding into Bitcoin, which should push up the price of Bitcoin over both the short term and long term. If big institutional investors decide to allocate just 1% of their multi-trillion-dollar portfolios to Bitcoin, the effect could be huge.\n\nEven if you think that an efficient market has largely priced in the effect of this spot Bitcoin ETF, there's a second, even bigger, reason to buy Bitcoin hand over fist in January: The Bitcoin halving. This halving event, scheduled for April 2024, is largely expected to kick off a major rally in Bitcoin.\n\nIn three previous halving cycles (in 2012, 2016, and 2020), Bitcoin skyrocketed in value. In the 2020 halving cycle, for example, Bitcoin eventually soared to a new all-time high of $69,000. While another huge incoming rally is hardly a slam dunk, Bitcoin could soar past the $100,000 mark by the end of 2024.\n\nSolana\n\nIn the final months of 2023, Solana gained tremendous momentum, and ended the year up nearly 1,000%. Thanks to this final year-end surge, Solana is now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nThe big question, of course, is whether this surge was driven by a huge speculative frenzy, or whether this rally was fueled by strong underlying fundamentals. After all, heading into 2023, Solana was pretty much left for dead. The crypto had lost more than 90% of its value, and the threat of \"FTX contagion\" made Solana toxic for many risk-averse investors.\n\nBut I'm firmly in the camp of investors who think that Solana has turned the corner over the past 12 months. Many key metrics used to evaluate a blockchain seemed to be trending in the right direction in 2023. By the end of the year, Solana was even showing signs of surpassing rival Ethereum (ETH -8.36%) in key areas such as non-fungible token (NFT) sales volume and decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume.\n\nAnd that's why I'm so bullish on Solana -- it has emerged as a serious competitor to Ethereum. As Cathie Wood of Ark Invest pointed out on CNBC, Solana is basically a faster, more cost-effective version of Ethereum. As such, it has a legitimate shot at becoming the preeminent Layer 1 blockchain platform in the world. As more users and developers migrate over to Solana, that will have a huge effect on Solana's ability to show growth in everything from NFTs to decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nIf you take a look at Ethereum's market cap ($284 billion) and then compare it to Solana's market cap ($47 billion), it's possible to calculate just how much higher Solana might soar in the coming years. A $284 billion market cap for Solana would imply a price of nearly $600. But some analysts are predicting even higher valuations. Investment firm VanEck, for example, has suggested a price closer to $3,200 might be possible by the year 2030.\n\nWhat to look for in 2024\n\nWhile the outlook for Bitcoin and Solana might appear very bullish right now, just keep in mind that the crypto market is notoriously volatile. Moreover, regulatory risk is always a factor. If regulators decide that they are not going to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, for example, that might prove disastrous for the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThat being said, both Bitcoin and Solana have tremendous long-term growth prospects, and both seem to be riding a wave of positive sentiment from investors. If you are looking to turbo-charge the performance of your portfolio in 2024, Bitcoin and Solana could be worth a closer look."

        "title": "Bitcoin Adoption: Hong Kong Is Asia's Rising Crypto Hub - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The city of Hong Kong is serious about crypto. After three years of struggles with COVID-19, the city is vibrant and flourishing again as business executives and tourists of all kinds pour back into Asia's financial center. New guidelines from the Securities and Futures Commission are paving the way.\n\nSince Hong Kong FinTech Week last year regulators have been building a comprehensive license regime for digital assets. Regulated under the principle of \u201csame business, same risks, same rules,\u201d digital assets are now being approached with similar rules to traditional financial ones. This has resulted in breakthrough moments for the industry this year such as when Hong Kong's licensed exchange HashKey launched a digital asset exchange App, and various traditional financial institutions received relevant licenses allowing them to offer digital asset retail trading.\n\nThis was made possible by the Hong Kong government's comprehensive strategy to make the city a desirable Web3 hub. It started with a goal to improve foreign investment and talent recruitment.\n\nThe Hong Kong government sees the digital assets industry as a driving force behind its immigration and foreign investment back into the city. Other steps the Hong Kong government has taken in this area include: announcing a series of policies focused on attracting overseas family offices with tax incentives and releasing a plan that allows Bitcoin to be purchased through compliant exchanges which is currently under consideration by Hong Kong's Investment Immigration Program.\n\nBy attracting foreign investment and top talent, city leaders hope to recover business confidence and a more diverse digital economy. In addition, the updated immigration talent scheme is designed to attract high earners and foreign graduates from top universities. So far the Secretary for Labour revealed the office has received more than the expected number of applications. All these efforts will lay a stronger foundation for the city to have a diverse pool of talent for the digital economy.\n\nDigital asset licensing has opened up opportunities to create powerhouse Hong Kong-based crypto companies. At Metalpha, we recently obtained an uplift on our Type 4 license (advising on securities). This will enable us to expand our efforts in advisory and issuing analysis, and allow us to publish reports to qualified investors on digital assets. This is a milestone for us and it further shows SFC\u2019s confidence in our business approach.\n\nIn fact, since the start of this year, we have observed strong demand from family offices and public companies asking how to invest in Bitcoin in a compliant way. Smart investors who see through the noise and beyond the negative headlines are being rewarded with clear opportunities to grow and benefit from crypto and Web3. I believe more companies will apply for licenses to attract investment, boost their business credibility, and pursue new opportunities as a result.\n\nA recent story reported by the Financial Times shows that Hong Kong is projected to overtake Switzerland as the world\u2019s leading cross-border wealth management as Asia spearheads the growth. This massive global wealth shift presents a great opportunity for investors eyeing digital assets. As regulations become clearer for the digital assets industry in the coming years, Hong Kong will stand out as a city that offers a balanced approach to innovation and risk assessment.\n\nLooking forward to the new year, I am confident that Hong Kong will keep playing a key role in building the Web3 hub and enter further direct competition with Singapore, which had an early mover advantage in crypto. And this is a good thing. Investors should have more options to choose the best crypto projects or companies to work with. As for customers, it will boost confidence once they know their service provider is secure and compliant in the eyes of regulators.\n\nThis is a guest post by Adrian Wang.

According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility however there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets.\u201d That includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through January 2, 2024)\n\nBitcoin finished 2023 up ~155% and is already off to a hot start for 2024 as its price nears $45,000.\n\nXRP\u2019s price closed out 2023 at $0.61 for a gain of 82%.\n\nEther\u2019s price closed out 2023 near $2,300 for an annual gain of 90%.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories.

This remarkable resurgence comes as investor confidence swells in anticipation of the potential approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), offering a more accessible avenue for institutions to invest in digital assets.\n\nImpressive Price Rebound\n\nBitcoin's comeback in 2024 has been nothing short of spectacular, defying previous market trends. The cryptocurrencies winning trend started from late 2023 only. The digital coin recorded a staggering 157% price increase last year. Investor confidence grew amid prospects of a Bitcoin ETF (read: 5 Favorable Events Bitcoin Had in 2023: ETFs in Focus).\n\nA bitcoin ETF would provide investors with a regulated and simplified way to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements, without the need to directly hold the cryptocurrency. Prominent players like BlackRock and others have recently updated their registration forms for proposed bitcoin ETFs, hinting at an impending decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Industry experts are optimistic about the approval of these funds, with expectations running high for an announcement in January.\n\nHalving Event in 2024\n\nAnother key factor contributing to Bitcoin's positive outlook is the upcoming halving event scheduled for 2024. During a halving event, the rewards offered to miners are halved, effectively reducing the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. Historically, these events have often preceded significant price surges, making them a point of anticipation for Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Momentum Extends Beyond Bitcoin\n\nThe bullish sentiment is not exclusive to Bitcoin; other cryptocurrencies are also experiencing substantial gains. Ethereum (Ether), a prominent altcoin, has seen a notable 4% increase in its price, reaching approximately $2,387.

Bitcoin has evolved into a network with a market capitalization of more than $888 billion, leading an ecosystem worth $1.8 trillion while maintaining 52% dominance in the cryptoverse.\n\nAlthough BTC is currently worth around $43,000, its value once rose above $68,000. The asset has garnered the interest of governments, banks, traditional finance giants, corporations, and high-networth individuals, leading to the creation of several derivatives, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe crypto community anticipates the launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, a feat that more than a dozen asset management firms are vying for.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF: Is It Priced In? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWith anticipation of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF reaching fever pitch levels in the opening days of 2024, frenzied discourse on the subject has now settled around one question: Is it already priced in?\n\nSome in crypto think the answer\u2019s yes. It\u2019s been over two months of non-stop gains for BTC, fueled almost entirely by excitement surrounding a Bitcoin ETF\u2019s imminent approval. At this point, with the cryptocurrency at near-double its price in October, how much more juice could possibly be left to squeeze?\n\nBut many diehard Bitcoin advocates are emphatic that the event hasn\u2019t been priced in\u2014meaning that, in their opinion, BTC is poised to rocket even further upwards if and when a Bitcoin ETF is approved in coming weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would at long last give traditional retail investors an easy way to gain exposure to BTC\u2014no crypto exchanges or wallets needed. But the SEC has rejected every proposal for such a product over the last 10 years, pointing to the potential for market manipulation in Bitcoin as its primary reason. But that was then and BlackRock is now\u2014and the Wall Street titan\u2019s entry into the Bitcoin ETF race means it\u2019s finally going to happen, most analysts say.\n\nMy strategy is understanding ETF has been priced in over the past few months - so no new big positions Holding spot, with a few low leverage trades on strongest altcoins and a few small caps Angel investing and preparing for new launches Keeping it simple at the time being, a\u2026 \u2014 Rager (@Rager) January 3, 2024\n\nAll signs point in the direction of an approval, which could then lead to a wave of fresh capital entering the market. It\u2019s the reason some traders and analysts are so bullish and expect a near immediate impact on BTC\u2019s price following the SEC\u2019s green light.\n\nSuch predictions tend to center on a belief that even taking recent gains into account, a substantial portion of the market has not been able to process the importance of a Bitcoin ETF approval, which some experts predict will change Bitcoin forever by integrating the digital asset into the global economy.\n\nThe ETFs are not priced in. \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) December 31, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs much as the event has been priced in, considering how much hangs in the balance, there is definitely some money sitting on the sidelines waiting for an actual confirmation,\u201d Joel Kruger, a strategist at LMAX Group, told Decrypt.\n\nKruger predicts that in the day or two following the first Bitcoin ETF\u2019s approval\u2014which analysts predict will happen in the next week\u2014BTC\u2019s price will likely jump by 10%. At that point, he says, there may be a brief period of consolidation and correction before the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency begins pumping again. As early as spring, according to the strategist, BTC could shatter its all-time high price of $69,000, which it briefly touched in late 2021.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, concurs that BTC is poised to continue its winning streak through and past the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cWe don't think it\u2019s fully priced for several reasons,\u201d he told Decrypt.\n\nButterfill points to the almost $14 trillion worth of American assets that he says will have the opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin once a spot Bitcoin ETF is greenlit. While only a fraction of that market is likely to opt in, it's nonetheless difficult to overstate the significance of the fact that Bitcoin might soon have theoretical interconnectivity with the majority of the US economy.\n\nFurther, the analyst has observed that, in the last quarter, inflows into existing Bitcoin investment products have come principally from Europe\u2014suggesting to him that many U.S. investors are waiting for U.S.-based ETFs to become available to then jump into Bitcoin.\n\nOther analysts, though, have been hesitant to paint such an unambiguously rosy picture of a Bitcoin ETF\u2019s likely price impact.\n\nVetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, wrote in a report Wednesday that he finds it 75% likely that a Bitcoin ETF approval becomes a \u201csell the news\u201d event\u2014meaning one that drops BTC\u2019s price due to a flood of investors selling off the cryptocurrency at the perceived crest of medium-term hype.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverything points towards traders being considerably exposed ahead of the verdict, with derivatives pushing massive premiums following BTC\u2019s last three months of continuous upside momentum,\u201d Lunde said.\n\nThe analyst did note, though, that if ETF inflows were substantial enough to offset that \u201csell the news\u201d outflow, the event could end up becoming a net boon for BTC. By Lunde\u2019s estimates, Bitcoin ETFs would need to attract fresh inflows of $2.3 billion in January alone to keep the asset\u2019s price from dropping. That new capital would have to be genuinely new; moving funds from Bitcoin futures ETFs to newly minted spot Bitcoin ETFs wouldn\u2019t count.\n\nLunde puts the likelihood of such an outcome at 20%\u2014certainly not impossible, but also not particularly likely. John Palmer, president of spot crypto clearinghouse Cboe Digital, previously told Decrypt that a terrific outcome for spot Bitcoin ETFs in their first year would be to attract $10 billion to $15 billion worth of investment by the end of 2024."

        "title": "The crypto world is losing its mind over when Bitcoin ETFs will arrive - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The regulatory process is normally a dry affair: Corporate executives ask their lawyers to file paperwork and then sit around until an agency makes a decision. But in the case of pending applications for a Bitcoin ETF, crypto nerds are sharing any detail\u2014real or imagined\u2014with an obsession reminiscent of Swifties tracking the progress of the Taylor-Travis courtship.\n\nThis fixation has only increased in the new year even though very little has happened in the last week when it comes to the Bitcoin ETF applications. But that hasn't stopped crypto bulls from gushing that an SEC approval will cause prices to go gangbusters, or others to opine that any price boost from an approval is already baked in. No one really knows for sure, but the crypto world has been happy to fill the information void with speculation, rumors, and conspiracies.\n\nThe latest example came on Wednesday morning when Bitcoin fell with a thud after a research report predicted that the SEC's approval\u2014widely expected to come next week\u2014wasn't going to happen after all. By midday, however, the nervous nellies on Crypto Twitter appeared to have persuaded themselves that the report author was wrong and prices made a modest recovery. Their confidence was boosted by a tweet from an unreliable journalist that the SEC will begin notifying would-be issuers on Friday that their applications have been approved, and that trading in Bitcoin ETF shares will begin next week.\n\nThis might be true. Or it might not. But what is certain is that this climate of chatter and uncertainty has provided opportunity for some A-plus trolling of the ETF obsessives. Most notably, Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal posted a BlackRock filing to support the position that \"ETF might boost the price, but theoretically it could benefit bitcoin in other ways as well. One entity controlling so much of the economic weight of the network might be in a position to push through block size increases, and code changes that enable smart contracts.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is exactly the sort of thing that triggers paranoid Bitcoiners' fear of centralization, and, while some correctly warned \u201cthat's bait!\u201d others eagerly piled onto Weisenthal\u2014prompting him to troll them some more. It's not my style, but I admire the game. At the very least, Weisenthal's jibe underscored just how squirrely the very-online world of crypto devotees can get.\n\nThe irony in all this is that those clamoring for early information on the ETF decision are unlikely to get it. The SEC, after all, is tasked with policing insider trading so it would be insane for anyone involved in the process to leak the agency's decision in advance. The upshot is that, when it comes to predicting the outcome of the Bitcoin ETF process, there's really only one thing to do: wait.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

(IQV), dropped 4% in intraday trading Wednesday after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that its request to temporarily block the health technology company from purchasing Propel Media Inc., a digital advertising firm, was granted. The FTC filed to block the purchase in July 2023, saying that IQVIA, \"the world\u2019s largest health-care data provider,\" acquiring Propel Media \"would give IQVIA a market-leading position in programmatic advertising for health-care products, namely prescription drugs, to doctors and other health-care professionals.\" The agency, which monitors marketplace competition, said that the merger \"would harm competition, raise prices for consumers, and hurt patients.

The Magnificent Seven\u2014the S&P 500\u2019s seven largest companies\u2014posted an average total return of 104% last year and accounted for more than 62% of the S&P 500\u2019s 26% gain. The rest of the index didn\u2019t fare quite so well. According to Bank of America, just 27% of S&P 500 stocks outperformed the index in 2023, making it the calendar year with the narrowest breadth in the firm\u2019s data going back to 1987. The equal-weight S&P 500 was in the red through October before a 17% rally in the last two months of the year pulled it into positive territory. The consensus on Wall Street, according to BofA, is that small-caps will continue to rally, gaining ground on the stocks that ran away with 2023. \u201cCrowding risk in the leaders of 2023 has been cited by many (including ourselves) as a key risk in 2024,\u201d wrote BofA equity strategist Savita Subramanian in a note Tuesday. The Magnificent Seven, she added, \u201ccould be used as a source of funds if a hard landing is avoided and leadership broadens beyond secular growth stocks.\u201d That said, not everyone agrees with that assessment. Some, like analysts at UBS, expect the largest tech companies, which have \"the significant resources needed to build and benefit from complex AI models,\" to continue to thrive in 2024. The first two trading days of the year appear a vindication of the bears. The Magnificent Seven are down an average of 2.3% as of Wednesday afternoon, while the equal weight S&P 500 has lost about 1%.\n\nA Chart to Watch Wednesday: XLV ETF The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) gained nearly 2% Tuesday after COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) gave the group a boost by projecting sales growth in 2025 and receiving an upgrade from independent investment bank Oppenheimer. CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel told investors the company could launch a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine candidate this year and a two-in-one flu/COVID vaccine in 2025, positioning the drugmaker for future growth. Meanwhile, analysts at Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to \u201coutperform,\u201d saying that the company could have five products on the market by 2026. Upbeat news from Moderna helped lift sentiment among other leading drug manufacturers, such as Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), which each carry weightings of over 5% in the ETF\u2019s portfolio of 66 holdings. Source: TradingView.com. The fund\u2019s price cleared the top of a yearlong trading range Tuesday on the highest share turnover since mid-November. Given that the price has rallied sharply from the range\u2019s lower trendline over the past two months, it may need to retest the initial breakout point before potentially attempting another leg higher. It\u2019s also worth keeping an eye on the $142 level\u2014an area on the chart that may run into resistance from a horizontal line connecting several prominent swing highs over the last two years.

Shares of Charles Schwab (SCHW) also sank after a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which said that lower interest rates could hurt Schwab's profits. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) shares slumped ahead of its financial report tomorrow, as analysts expect a drop in earnings because of a big decline in COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Shares of Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and other energy providers gained as oil prices spiked after a disruption in production at a key oilfield in Libya. Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares advanced as the U.S. Air Force awarded it a $9.2 million contract to improve the range of air-to-air missiles. Shares of AutoZone (AZO) rose with Phil Daniele officially taking over as CEO from longtime company head Bill Rhodes. -Bill McColl\n\nOil Jumps as Fear of Regional Middle East Conflict Builds Oil futures surged Wednesday morning as fighting in the Red Sea and a deadly attack at the gravesite of an Iranian military commander fanned fears of a larger conflict engulfing the oil-rich region. More than 100 people were reported dead Wednesday after two bombs detonated near the grave of Qassem Soleimani in the city of Kerman on the fourth anniversary of his killing by a U.S. drone strike. The bombing comes a day after Hamas accused Israel of ordering an air strike that killed a senior official in Lebanon. This week\u2019s violence has fanned fears that fighting between Israel and Hamas will spill over into neighboring countries like Lebanon and draw in Iran, which supports Hamas and allies like Hezbollah. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have for weeks been targeting commercial ships transiting the Red Sea, leading many oil tankers and shipping companies to redirect traffic around Africa. In response, the U.S. and Iran have both sent naval vessels to the waterway. West Texas Intermediate futures jumped more than 3% Wednesday, rising from below $70 a barrel to nearly $73 by midday. Brent crude, the European benchmark, rose from $75 to about $78 a barrel.\n\nFord Falls After Recalling Over 112,000 F-150 Pickups For Roll Away Risk Ford (F) shares fell nearly 4% Wednesday morning after the automaker recalled 112,965 F-150 pickups due to roll away risks. The automaker said that the recall, which potentially affects 112,965 pickup trucks, concerns a rear axle hub bolt that \"may fatigue and break\" which could \"result in damage to the axle hub splines.\" The company reported that a \"remedy is currently under development\" and that \"owners will be instructed to take their vehicle to a dealer for an interim repair if they experience symptoms related to rear axle bolt breakage, such as a clicking or rattling noise.\" -Naomi Buchanan\n\nWalt Disney Reaches Agreement with ValueAct in Bid to Fend off Peltz Shares of Walt Disney Co. (DIS) rose early Wednesday after the company said it was teaming up with hedge fund ValueAct to fend off a proxy fight with activist investor Nelson Peltz. The companies said in a joint statement Wednesday that they had reached an agreement allowing Disney to share otherwise confidential information with ValueAct and consult the investment firm on strategic decisions. As part of the pact, ValueAct has agreed to support Disney\u2019s slate of nominees to its Board of Directors. \u201cValueAct Capital has a track record of collaboration and cooperation with the companies it invests in, and its Co-CEO Mason Morfit has been very constructive in the conversations we\u2019ve had over the past year. We welcome their input as long-term shareholders,\u201d said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement. Disney is facing a proxy fight with activist investor Nelson Peltz, who through his firm Trian Fund Management nominated himself and former Disney CFO James Result to the company\u2019s board in December. It is Peltz\u2019s second proxy battle with Disney in two years. He attempted to join the board in 2022 before dropping his bid after the company announced sweeping cost-cutting measures.\n\nStocks Making the Biggest Moves Premarket Gains: Pure Storage Inc. (PSTG): Shares of the storage company rose about 6% after S&P Global said it would join the S&P 400 MidCap Index effective Jan. 5, replacing Patterson Companies Inc. (PDCO).\n\nNovartis AG (NVS): Shares of the pharmaceutical company rose 2% a day after it announced a gene therapy deal with biotech Voyager Therapeutics that will see it pay $100 million upfront, plus an additional $1.1 billion if certain regulatory and sales milestones are met.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (VZ): Shares rose nearly 2% after KeyBanc upgraded the telecom provider to \u201coverweight,\u201d citing its relative strength compared to AT&T, one of its only real competitors.\n\nLosses: Coinbase Global (COIN): Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange fell more than 6%, adding to yesterday\u2019s losses, as the price of Bitcoin tumbled ahead of the SEC\u2019s decision, expected this week, on a spot ETF.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL): Shares of the cruise operator fell nearly 2% as investors continued to sell off 2023\u2019s biggest winners; Carnival was the third-best performing stock in the S&P 500 last year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA): The chipmaker\u2019s shares fell about 1%, extending yesterday\u2019s losses alongside other chip stocks Arm Plc (ARM), down 2% premarket, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), down more than 1%."

        "content": "Bitcoin\n\nWith Bloomberg analysts forecasting a 90% probability of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot bitcoin ETF by Jan. 10, issuers have already begun jockeying for market share through their pricing.\n\nFidelity, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie, among others, have released their fee structures in recent filings with the SEC. So far, these fees have ranged widely from Valkyrie\u2019s 0.8% to Fidelity\u2019s more recently introduced 0.39%.\n\nFunds\u2019 fees, which are historically competitive in the ETF industry, will be key in grabbing investor attention.\n\nRegulatory approval would end a roughly decade-long odyssey for spot bitcoin ETFs, which track the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value. The SEC rejected multiple such products in 2022 and 2023, but a June 15 filing by BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, rekindled interest among a number of financial services giants, who in the immediate aftermath submitted first-time filings or refiled previously rejected applications.\n\nA watershed court decision in August separately forced the agency to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The SEC had previously approved ETFs that track crypto futures, which speculate on bitcoin\u2019s future price movement.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Fee Range\n\nIn a Dec. 29 update to its prospectus, Invesco disclosed that it would waive fees for the first six months of the ETF\u2019s operation and for the first $5 billion it accumulates in assets. After reaching those two milestones, Invesco would charge 0.59%. Fidelity has so far disclosed the lowest fee, 0.39%.\n\nFor ETF investors, low fees are often a critical draw, separating the investment vehicle from mutual funds. Yet as the ETF industry grows and issuers use more complex trading techniques, the cost of operating ETFs has been higher than for broad index funds.\n\nThe current expense ratio for cryptocurrency ETFs on the market, including bitcoin futures funds, is 2.31%, according to etf.com data.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com .\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market was hit with a deep correction on Wednesday as a report suggesting the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could reject multiple spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF applications made the rounds, sparking the latest round of FUD and instigating a widespread sell-off.\n\nMany analysts have said the reaction was overblown, especially because the SEC reportedly held meetings on Wednesday with the Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE exchanges to finalize comments on the 19b-4 forms submitted by the prospective BTC Spot ETF issuers.\n\n\u201cThings you prob don't do if you going to deny or delay,\u201d said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, in response to reports of the meeting and the circulating rumor that the applications would be denied. \"Hearing similar by the way... when we see updated (final) 19b-4s roll in that is a sign approval is imminent as SEC has been doing back and forth with issuers offline to perfect their 19b-4s.\"\n\nStocks also fell under pressure after the latest jobs report in the U.S. showed there were 8.79 million job openings at the end of November, the lowest reading since March 2021, and below the expected 8.82 million openings. This led many to reevaluate their expectations that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates as soon as March, leading to declining asset prices as some traders moved to derisk.\n\nAt the market close, the S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq were in the red, down 0.80%, 0.76%, and 1.18%, respectively.\n\nData provided by TradingView shows that Bitcoin underwent a rapid sell-off over two hours on Wednesday morning, plunging more than 10% from $45,150 to a daily low near $40,635 before dip buyers arrived to halt the sell-off.

Bulls still have the firm overall near-term technical advantage.\u201d\n\nDespite Wednesday\u2019s price plunge, most analysts remain positive about the outlook for Bitcoin and crypto in 2024 and beyond, and think it's only a matter of time before the top crypto hits a new all-time high.\n\n\u201cMy base-case expectation is for new all-time highs, hopefully over $100,000, so hopefully six figures,\u201d said popular macro expert Lyn Alden. \u201cThat range is entirely reasonable.\u201d\n\nBut Alden doesn\u2019t think that would be the top and said a peak price of $100,000 during the current bull cycle would be somewhat of a letdown.\n\n\u201cI think that something like $100,000 plus would be kind of disappointing for a bull market cycle, especially after the prior bull market cycle was on the disappointing end, too,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019d kind of hope for $200,000 or more over the next two-plus years.\u201d\n\nInsight into what could push BTC to those prices was provided by John Palmer, the president of Cboe Digital, during an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\u201cSeeing that approval is going to pave the way for pension funds and RIA-based funds to be able to invest in assets in a spot Bitcoin ETF where they may not be able to gain that access today in just a native, spot Bitcoin token,\u201d he said.\n\nPalmer added that institutional players would utilize both a spot BTC ETF and other Bitcoin derivative products in unison to hedge risks associated with Bitcoin investments.\n\nWhile some analysts see the approval of a spot BTC ETF as a \u2018sell the news\u2019 event, long term, most remain bullish.\n\nAccording to the latest report from K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde and head of research Anders Helseth, there is a 75% chance of a \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 event occurring, as opposed to a 20% chance of the ETFs receiving approval and generating substantial inflows that could mitigate selling pressure. They also gave a small bit of credence to Wednesday\u2019s denial rumors, saying they see a 5% chance that the ETFs might be rejected.\n\nDouble-digit gainers in a sea of red\n\nAll but two dozen tokens in the top 200 recorded losses on Wednesday, but as usual, several tokens managed to buck the trend to post double-digit gains.\n\nDaily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360\n\nPowerledger (POWR) was the biggest gainer, increasing 39.25% to trade at $0.51, while Chromia (CHR) climbed 25.4%, and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gained 15.6%. Tellor (TRB) led the losers with a decline of 20.1%, followed by a loss of 18.9% for GMT (GMT), and a loss of 17.4% for Memecoin (MEME).\n\nThe overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.63 trillion, and Bitcoin\u2019s dominance rate is 51.2%."

        "title": "Mint Explainer: What\u2019s behind the surge in bitcoin prices | Mint - Mint",
        "content": "After rising by more than 150% in 2023, the price of bitcoin surpassed $45,000 on the second day of 2024, to its highest level since April 2022. Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and the largest by market capitalisation. Many analysts and industry experts expect the rally to continue in the current calendar year, with some expecting bitcoin to rise to $100,000 in the coming months. (Although the price fell nearly 11% on Wednesday before bouncing back to $42,200, as per CoinDesk data. On Thursday morning in India, bitcoin was at about $43,100.)\n\nBitcoin last rose to its all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021 and then fell to a low of $15,760 in December 2022 amid the collapse of FTX, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, and fraud charges pressed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against its CEO Samuel Bankman-Fried, fears of worsening macroeconomic conditions and rising interest rates.\n\nThe latest rally was triggered by impending developments\u2013the halving of bitcoin rewards and the potential approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the US. The US Federal Reserve signalling interest rate cuts in 2024 has also helped the rally. Mint explains the factors behind the recent rally.\n\nWhat is halving of bitcoin rewards and how does it affect the price?\n\nThe creators of bitcoin designed the cryptocurrency with a cap of 21 million to limit its supply, which they felt would create a scarcity as demand rises and thus push up its value. So far, 19.6 million have already been mined, and 900 bitcoins are added per day currently. Crypto miners are rewarded 6.25 bitcoins at present for every block they create and a new block is produced approximately every 10 minutes.\n\nThe code written by the inventors of bitcoin requires the rewards per block to be halved every time 210,000 blocks are added\u2013which usually happens every four years. This halving of rewards is expected to happen in April-May, and the number of bitcoins rewarded per block created will drop to 3.125.\n\nThe number of bitcoins minted per block was 50 when it was created. The rewards were previously halved in 2020, and before that in 2012 and 2016. The final halving will happen around 2140, after which it will not be possible to halve the rewards. At that point, the number of bitcoins in circulation is expected to be about 21 million.\n\nThe halving of bitcoin rewards per block slows the increase in the supply of the cryptocurrency. As a result, bitcoin prices usually start to rise much before the halving event and usually soar after the halving takes place.\n\nFor instance, in the 12 months following the last halving in 2020, bitcoin gained about 560%. Similarly, in the 12 months after the first halving in 2012, bitcoin jumped more than 8,000%. If the same trends persist, bitcoin may soar to the levels projected by various industry experts and analysts.\n\nWhy are investors looking forward to spot bitcoin ETF?\n\nThe US SEC has until 10 January to approve proposals of asset managers to launch spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. There are over a dozen applications before the markets regulator. It is widely anticipated that the SEC will approve the ETF proposals much before the deadline (it may come this week), even though it has not given any indications whether it will indeed approve the applications.\n\nA regulated product like an ETF could encourage a lot more people and institutions to invest in bitcoins. Some estimate that about $3 billion may flow into the ETF products in the US on the first day.\n\nAmong those that have filed applications to launch ETFs based on the spot prices of bitcoin are Ark Investment, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity.\n\nUnlike the bitcoin futures ETF, which involves investment in futures contracts, spot ETFs invest in the cryptocurrency directly. Investors in the US can currently invest in bitcoin futures ETF, which were first launched in October 2021. Most of the asset managers who have sought SEC approval for spot bitcoin ETFs already run bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nCan the easing of interest rates also boost bitcoins?\n\nRising interest rates affected cryptocurrencies like all other asset classes that are risky. When the Fed held rates steady at its December meeting, cryptocurrencies gained.\n\nMore significantly, investors have been increasing their exposure to cryptos after a rough 2022, when stablecoins Terra and Luna crashed and the FTX scam came to light. With the Fed signalling that rate cuts may begin sometime in 2024, investors will be willing to increase their investment in risky assets such as cryptos.\n\nWhile there is a lot of optimism around bitcoin at this point, another FTX-like bankruptcy or a scam can cause the cryptocurrency market to crash like it did in 2022. Most of these catch investors unaware, leading to deep losses."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin crashed nearly 10% on Wednesday, falling from $45,000 to below $41,000 in mere hours, hurting crypto\u2019s best bull run in a year. But what, or who, could have been the culprit behind the crash? The day before, CNBC\u2019s host of Mad Money, Jim Cramer, directed his powerful investing advice towards Bitcoin.\n\nHe Tossed His Bitcoin, Now He Wants It Back CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video He Tossed His Bitcoin, Now He Wants It Back\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kill it,\u201d said Cramer on CNBC Tuesday, referring to the remarkable rally Bitcoin had last year. \u201cIt\u2019s here to stay,\u201d he said, just a day before the biggest crypto crash of the new year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh, yes, the kiss of Inverse Cramer. The X account @CramerTracker has been calling out the CNBC host\u2019s bets since 2021, and noting the curious tendency for the opposite to happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBear Stearns is fine,\u201d said Jim Cramer in March 2008, just one week before the financial giant failed during the Great Recession. \u201cI think you\u2019re pretty much a visionary,\u201d said Cramer to Sam Bankman-Fried a year before FTX collapsed and was revealed to be nothing but a massive fraud. Naive viewers may assume that Jim Cramer is simply wrong, but true fans understand the CNBC host commands the opposite of what he says to come true. Whether his powers are some ethereal connection to the finance gods, or something else, the latest showing of his inverse powers on Bitcoin is no exception.\n\n\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been propped up in recent months by speculation that a Bitcoin ETF may soon get approved by the SEC. Coindesk reports that major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and others are investigating how to play a key role in Bitcoin ETFs, which would mark a significant win for the cryptocurrency industry. The ETFs in question would offer a safer way for folks to invest in Bitcoin and would require large institutions to buy up a ton of digital currency. That being said, there\u2019s nothing set in stone for the financial vehicle\u2019s approval just yet.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Singapore-based digital asset firm Matrixport published a research report forecasting the SEC would reject all spot bitcoin ETF applications, according to CoinDesk. Several analysts refuted Matrixpoint\u2019s argument, as a strategist told CoinDesk that approval for a Bitcoin ETF is \u201ca matter of when, not if.\u201d However, some suspect this negative sentiment in a bullish environment to be the cause of the crash.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell what truly caused the crash, as Bitcoin\u2019s price is motivated by countless factors, and it rebounded in price to more than more than $44,000 Thursday afternoon. That being said, Inverse Cramer is a force to be reckoned with, and the cryptocurrency\u2019s fate is still in question."

Bitcoin, which is the world's largest cryptocurrency, recorded a hike of 6 percent on Tuesday, January 6. Bitcoin continues to rally forward amid the $45,000 mark break (Reuters)(REUTERS)\n\nBitcoin was up by a total of 6.43% on Tuesday, touching its all time high since 2022 at $45,317.67. A day after breaching the historic mark, Bitcoin continues to go strong, up by a little less than one percent on Wednesday.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nOn January 3, the Bitcoin rates were recorded at $45,257.70, not close to dipping below its 21-month high. The rates were 0.70 percent higher than the closing price of the cryptocurrency. This also led to an overall surge in the cryptocurrency market in the first few days of January.\n\nWith the Bitcoin prices surging above $45,000 for the first time in months, the rates of the cryptocurrency in India were recorded at \u20b937,66,766.47 on Wednesday, up by \u20b922,454 after the sudden price surge.\n\nOther tokens in the crypto market traded higher on January 2-3 due to Bitcoin, with Ethereum surging by 3.8%, Solana (SOL) gaining over 7% while Cardano up over 5%. It is expected that the surge in cryptocurrency will continue during the week.\n\nReason behind Bitcoin price surge\n\nThe prime reason behind the hike in the prices of Bitcoin is the expectation that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the launch of a spot bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nThe decision of the SEC will be finalised by January 10, when it will either approve or reject the Ark/21Shares ETF, reported Reuters. However, the decision regarding the same can come this week, by Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected multiple applications to launch spot bitcoin ETFs in recent years, arguing that the cryptocurrency market is vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nAs per past trends, Bitcoin often rallied forward during the US Election season, which means that the crypto markets will continue to buzz for the next few months. However, the rise and fall of crypto in the United States will primarily be determined by the decision of the SEC.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)"

        "content": "There are two main events that can drive the Bitcoin prices up: BTC's fourth halving event, and the US Security Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision for spot BTC ETFs in the US\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nIf 2022 was the year that almost wrote off cryptos, 2023 saw them bouncing back. This is despite a churn of technological innovation, market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and fall of titans (Both Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, and Changpeng Zhao, CZ of Binance, pleaded guilty of violating money laundering rules). The most popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin saw a whopping 154% surge in 2023. From around $17,000 at the start of the year, BTC went up to $44,000. Of this, however, much of the gains came later in the year. The overall crypto market cap also swelled to $1.62 trillion from $831.8 billion at the beginning of the year.\n\nSays Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch, \"BTC has recorded a substantial price surge and has been breaking past crucial resis- tance levels with healthy volume. Various narratives have influenced this price action, with investor sentiment undeniably strengthening.\" According to Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay, this growth can broadly be attributed to increasing interest in the crypto market by both retail and institutional investors. \"Global macroeconomic factors have also contributed to this growth with countries coming together to decide the future roadmap of crypto assets through regulatory frameworks,\" says Pagidipati.\n\nBITCOIN IN 2024\n\nSo what does 2024 look like for Bitcoin? The cryptocurrency started the year with a bang. On January 2, 2024, the Bitcoin crossed past $45,000. The big question is: Will it soar even higher during the year? There are two main events that can drive the Bitcoin prices up in 2024: BTC's fourth halving event, and the US Security Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision for spot BTC ETFs in the US.\n\nTHE HALVING EVENT\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event occurs every four years and reduces the supply of Bitcoins by half which means there are less Bitcoins to buy in the market after that. The most direct way the Bitcoin halving impacts price comes down to simple supply and demand. If there are fewer Bitcoins being made available, the price ought to rise, assuming demand remains constant or increases. In addition, miners only have half as much Bitcoin available to sell to cover their operational expenses, reducing overall selling pressure in the market.\n\nPAST HALVING EVENTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE BTC PRICE\n\nThe first halving occurred on November 28, 2012, and reduced the block reward to 25 BTC from 50 BTC. Price at the time of halving was $13. However, the following year it reached a peak of $1,152. Prior to the first halving, Bitcoin was unknown to almost everyone but when the price in dollars ballooned from double digits to over $1,000, Bitcoin started making some headlines. The second halving occurred on July 16, 2016, and reduced the block reward to 12.5 BTC. Price at time of halving was $664.However, the following year it peaked to $17,760. The third halving occurred on May 11, 2020, and reduced the block reward to 6.25 BTC. At that time the price of Bitcoin stood at $9,734. Following year it touched a peak of $67,549. The third halving was different in the sense that it occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, when most of the global economy had been shut down. Despite this, the price pattern for BTC/USD mostly held true to previous cycles. The next halving event will reduce the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\n\nBITCOIN ETFS\n\nAnother major driver that can lead price of Bitcoin further is Bitcoin ETFs. Asset management giants like BlackRock and Fidelity are among the 13 companies that have submitted applications to the US SEC for it. Such a fund is expected to pull in as much as $3 billion from investors in the first few days of trading and billions more thereafter. \"The chatter surrounding a potential Bitcoin ETF in 2024 excites me. If approved, it could unlock a flood of institutional capital, potentially trillions of dollars, propelling the market to new heights. This potential influx is what makes me bullish on the entire crypto space, and I see current price movements as early signs of this shift,\" says Minal Thukral, EVP(Growth & Strategy), CoinDCX.\n\nSOARING TO $100000 IN 2024?\n\nWhile analysts at Standard Chartered Bank have projected that Bitcoin's value could soar to $100,000 by the end of 2024, the views of industry insiders differ. Says Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, \"Crypto market may suffer a supply shock after Bitcoin halving and the price of Bitcoin may surge to $50,000-$55,000 after the event and may touch $65000 by the end of 2024 without factoring the impact of Bitcoin halving.\" Adds Thukral, \"Predicting Bitcoin's 2024 price is intri- cate, even with the forth- coming halving. While the event likely contributes to the current price, its full impact remains uncertain. His- torical associations between halvings and price surges exist, but market complexities make precise predictions challenging. Investors should recognize that the market efficiently absorbs information, potentially factoring in anticipated events.\n\nFactors like market sentiment, regulatory changes, and technological advancements could influence outcomes.\"\n\nSays Chaturvedi, \"Past Bitcoin 'halving events' have ushered in a bull run in prices. In-built in the Bitcoin network's algorithm is the halving of miner rewards after every 210,000 blocks, with the next halving scheduled for around April 2024. This 'supply shock' will be met with massive institutional demand if the submission of spot BTC ETF applications gets approved by the SEC. These demand and supply factors, coupled with decreasing interest rates, could send BTC prices higher and the markets already seem to be reacting in anticipation of the same. Says Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, \"Analysts point out that Bitcoin often sees a rally around 60 days before a halving, followed by a \"pre-halving retrace\" around the time of the event. Investors often use this pre-halving retracement as an opportunity to reaccumulate or \"stack Sats.\" However, it's also a period where some investors might exit due to impatience or disappointment from the lack of immediate significant returns post-halving. After the halving and reaccumulation phase, Bitcoin has historically entered a phase of parabolic price increases. For example, months following each of the previous halvings, Bitcoin reached new all-time highs, with the last significant peak being around $69,000 in late 2021, following the May 2020 halving.\"\n\nHowever, experts also point out towards focusing on fundamentals. Says Pagidipati, \"The growing interest in Bitcoin and the increased participation of institutional investors could coincide with the Bitcoin halving event. 2024 is going to be a very important year for crypto and could set the tone for the next market cycle.\"\n\nFATE OF OTHER CRYPTOS\n\nBitcoin is often seen as a bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. Take for instance, Etherium, the second most popular currency. It has already crossed the level of $2200 as of Dec 14, 2023, which is a whopping 80% rise from what it was trading at the beginning of the year. According to experts, Bitcoin's performance can set the tone for the broader market. \"This is followed by an Ethereum rally. After Bitcoin and Ethereum, attention turns to various altcoins in the market. Altcoin season typically involves a surge in the prices of alternative cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon can lead to a decline in Bitcoin dominance,\"\u0101dds Menon.\n\n\"For the broader markets, the typical cycle follows a set pattern with capital first heading towards BTC increasing its market capitalization dominance, which has already surpassed 50%. This is followed by the rotation of capital into Ethereum's ETH and finally the peak 'bull-run' gains steam as the capital rotates into 'riskier' alt-coins. We are still in the first phase of the capital rotation cycle and there's a lot of steam for growth in broader crypto prices. It is worth highlighting that several token-specific developments are playing out as well, that will impact individual token prices based on their respective narratives,\" adds Chaturvedi.\n\n\"We have seen in the past that Bitcoin mostly leads the market rally followed by Ethereum and other altcoins. Most of the digital assets have touched year highs which gives us a glimpse of positive 2024 market trends,\" adds Thakral.\n\n\"Historically, surges in prices have served as leading indicators, sparking increased developer activity and funding for new projects. This positive momentum creates a ripple effect, fostering more innovation and growth within the crypto ecosystem. Furthermore, the ongoing technological advancements, such as L2 solutions and zero-knowledge proofs, add another layer of optimism. These developments pave the way for a multitude of new applications, driving real adoption in the coming years,\" says Thukral.\n\nTAKE AN SIP APPROACH\n\nAccording to industry insiders, SIP (Systematic Investment Planning) or DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) are widely recommended strategies for investing in volatile assets like Bitcoin. \"These methods involve investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market conditions, which can mitigate the impact of volatility. A disciplined investment approach, considering a time horizon of 3-5 years, can be sensible. However, it's essential to tailor the strategy to individual risk tolerances and financial goals.\"\n\nAgrees Chaturvedi, \"The best way to mitigate volatility risks is by systematically investing over a longer timeframe, using a SIP-type investment strategy. As per industry experts, a 2-5% allocation of your portfolio into crypto, can help boost risk-adjusted returns over longer duration time frames. So don't put all your eggs in one basket and diversify your allocation.\"\n\nAccording to Pagidipati, focusing on fundamentals is crucial, \"Historically, we did see the price take a bullish turn after the halving event. But one should focus on the fundamentals and understand the underlying economics without getting carried away by the possibility that the price could rise.\" Thukral insist on diversification, \"While Bitcoin is a prominent player, diversifying your portfolio can help manage overall risk exposure. Bitcoin's historical performance suggests that patient investors tend to fare better.\""

As of 12/26/23, @MicroStrategy now hodls 189,150 $BTC acquired for ~$5.9 billion at an average price of $31,168 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/PKfYY59sTW \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) December 27, 2023\n\nSaylor has also bought Bitcoin for his personal holdings, revealing in a 2020 tweet that he had acquired 17,732 BTC at an average purchase price of $9,882. Saylor retweeted his 2020 post in October 2021, stating that, \"You do not sell your #bitcoin.\"\n\nAt current prices, Saylor's personal Bitcoin holdings are worth just over $800,000,000. Assuming it's held in one address, Saylor's personal Bitcoin holdings would place him among the top 103 Bitcoin addresses, per BitInfoCharts (with the caveat that Bitcoin can be held across multiple addressess by one individual).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking during the conference call, Saylor said that he remains \"optimistic\" about MicroStrategy's prospects, and will retain a \"very significant\" equity stake in the company. Buoyed by Bitcoin's recent price surge above $45,000, MicroStrategy's stock price rose to $691.74 in pre-market trading. In a December 31 tweet, Saylor celebrated MicroStrategy's 2023 performance, noting that the company had been \"empowered\" by Bitcoin."

        "title": "Is Bitcoin 21st century's prime example of 'greater fool' theory? - Onmanorama",
        "content": "Bitcoin had a spectacular 2023 \u2013 over the 12 months, its market cap went up from Rs 26,00,000 crore ($319 billion) to Rs 69,00,000 crore ($830 billion) For context, the latest quarterly Indian GDP is almost equal at Rs 71,00,000 crore and market cap of 30 Sensex stocks on BSE is twice that at Rs 142,00,000 crore.\n\n\n\nReliance Industries runs the largest crude oil refinery in the world, the third-largest telecom company in the world by subscriber count and the largest retailer in India by revenue. In COVID-hit 2020, the largest equity fundraising in the world was by Reliance at $20 billion. And its market cap is Rs 17,50,000 crore. What then is the contribution of Bitcoin to command a market cap four times that of Reliance? Nothing.\n\nLast year, India\u2019s second richest man Gautam Adani had to face a short seller attack from Hindenburg, inquiry by a Supreme Court-appointed committee and probing by market regulator SEBI. It was also the subject of investigative journalism from the Financial Times and others. India\u2019s largest airport and seaport and largest green energy producers are part of his group.\n\nAdani Group ended 2023 with a market cap of Rs 15,00,000 crore from Rs 21,00,000 crore at the start of the year. But what has Bitcoin done in 2023 to add Rs 43,00,000 crore to its market cap and be valued at 4.6 times the market cap of the Adani Group? Again, nothing.\n\nBitcoin has simply gained in value \u2013 without producing any product or service that we use, without giving any cashflows to its investors such as interest or dividend, without owning any real or financial asset like factories or bonds and without having any intrinsic value of a commodity such as water, crude oil or rice. So where does its value come from?\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts might say that it is a currency and it is valued differently. If so, how does Bitcoin compare with official national currencies such as the Indian rupee or US dollar? Official currencies are backed by assets held by the issuer. That is, a Rs 100 note represents a claim worth Rs 100 on the assets in RBI's balance sheet. And what are those assets? Gold, bonds issued by the Government of India, USA, etc. And the government bonds are backed by the monopoly taxation power of the respective governments. In other words, Indian sovereign bonds are backed by the productive capacity of the Indian economy and US treasuries by the productive capacity of the largest economy of the world. So what is Bitcoin backed by? For the third time, the answer is nothing.\n\nValue from scarcity?\n\nAnother argument offered in defence of Bitcoin is that its supply is capped and hence there is scarcity which leads to the continuing appreciation in value whereas national currencies can be issued without any limit and hence may result in inflation and hyperinflation. How true is this?\n\nImagine a city where no restaurants serve biryani since it is unknown in that city. Sensing an opportunity, someone starts a restaurant serving biryani and it becomes a huge hit. As the demand goes up, the restaurant owner comes up with an idea to increase profits \u2013 he caps the number of biryanis sold per day at 500 even when there is a demand for 1,000 or more. Thus each biryani can be sold well above cost and will fetch super-normal profits. It is better than increasing the supply to match demand and selling at reasonable prices. Will this strategy succeed? Certainly not as new suppliers will set up shop to fill the unmet demand and thus super normal profits will remain just a dream. Capping Bitcoin supply and creating artificial scarcity is also like this as new private currencies will emerge to meet the unmet demand as there are no entry barriers.\n\nIs Bitcoin digital gold?\n\nGold is special because water, air, fire and acid will not corrode it. Thus all the gold ever produced still exists as shiny as ever. Most importantly, gold has natural scarcity which helps it retain and grow in value. But Bitcoin? One among the thousands of private virtual currencies with the only uniqueness being the first private virtual currency \u2013 which may make it a collector\u2019s item and nothing more.\n\nRepresentations of cryptocurrencies are seen in this illustration, August 10, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nThe genesis of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was created shortly after the global financial crisis to solve two problems. One inflation \u2013 inflation could eat away the value of your savings held as currency when central banks print money without limits. And banks going bust \u2013 banks often lose money when reckless lending creates unrecoverable loans. Bitcoin sought to solve these problems by capping the supply and keeping the currency under the self-custody of the saver. Legitimate goals, though in practice Bitcoin delivered neither.\n\nBut current advocates of Bitcoin promote it for a different reason. Their theory goes like this \u2013 the entire world would ditch national currencies and shift to Bitcoin which would be the lone global currency. As Bitcoin supply is capped and 90% of the total supply is already in the market, there will be a mad rush to buy Bitcoin from current holders and thus current holders will make huge gains. But 8 billion people, 190-plus sovereign states and all the entities in these states simply accept Bitcoin as the global currency \u2013 such a scenario looks Utopian.\n\nFor a moment imagine that such an economy does come about. Who will get rich? Those holding the Bitcoin. At whose expense? Those who work, create and produce; those who solve our problems; those who take humanity forward. Thus owners contributing nothing prosper and doers contributing everything get impoverished \u2013 is that fair by 21st century standards?\n\nWhat then explains Bitcoin\u2019s price?\n\nThere are plenty of true believers in Bitcoin Utopia and then there are those who know Bitcoin is worthless, yet buy it at absurd prices hoping there will be that greater fool who will buy it for a still higher price from them. Bitcoin seems to be the 21st century\u2019s most enduring example of the greater fool theory.\n\nDoes that mean only national currencies will survive in this world? Currency on its own has no value. It is valued simply because it can be exchanged for goods, services and assets. Currency will be exchanged with goods, services and assets as long as everyone is confident that everyone else will accept it. Also, the currency should store value without much erosion. For this, the money supply should move in tandem with changes in economic output and the productive capacity of the economy. So far only national currencies have met both these requirements to a reasonable extent.\n\nWe may create algorithm-based currencies which pass both the confidence and money stock tests successfully. But that currency is certainly not Bitcoin. Where does that leave Bitcoin? It is nothing more than a speculative token whose prices can go up or down for no particular reason."

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETF: Matrixport predicts likely rejection and price fall - CoinGape",
        "content": "The crypto-focused financial services platform, Matrixport has shaken the crypto community with a bold forecast recently on Bitcoin price and SEC\u2019s stance on spot Bitcoin ETF decisions. According to their recent report, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is anticipated to reject all spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, potentially triggering a sharp decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value to as much as $36,000.\n\nMeanwhile, this revelation has sent shockwaves through the market, prompting Matrixport to advise investors to consider protective measures, such as purchasing put options or even engaging in direct shorting of Bitcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMatrixport Predicts SEC\u2019s Potential Rejection of Spot Bitcoin ETF Applications\n\nMatrixport\u2019s report challenges the optimistic expectations surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s future, citing the SEC\u2019s likely rejection of spot ETFs as a pivotal factor. Despite the crypto platform\u2019s earlier bullish stance, they now express skepticism about the SEC\u2019s willingness to embrace cryptocurrencies.\n\nMeanwhile, the report highlights the dominant influence of Democratic leadership within the SEC, particularly Chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s cautious approach to crypto regulation. In addition, Matrixport suggests a potential delay in ETF approvals until Q2 2024, dampening hopes of an imminent market boost.\n\nThe firm contends that the current influx of funds into crypto, driven by expectations of spot Bitcoin ETF approval, could result in significant liquidations if the SEC denies the proposals. Besides, an estimated $10 billion of the $14 billion additional investments might be linked to optimistic ETF prospects, the report showed. Notably, the report foresees a rapid 20% decline in Bitcoin price, reverting to a range of around $36,000-$38,000, should the SEC reject the ETFs.\n\nAlso Read: Internet Computer Protocol Grabs Limelight With 222% ICP Price Rally\n\nAdvise For Traders\n\nWith an ominous January 5, 2024 deadline looming, Matrixport urges traders to hedge their long exposure by considering protective measures. Notably, the recommendation includes purchasing $40,000 strike put options expiring at the end of January or even opting for outright short positions through options.\n\nDespite the potential SEC setback, Matrixport maintains a positive long-term outlook for Bitcoin, expecting the BTC price to end 2024 above the $42,000 mark, at which it started the year. The analysis also highlights the historical trends in US election years and Bitcoin mining cycles for the potential rally.\n\nMeanwhile, as of writing, the Bitcoin price was down 5% from yesterday and traded at $42,470. Over the last 24 hours, it has touched a high of $45,503 and a low of $41,804.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Exchange CoinDCX Dismisses Fraud Allegations Report"

        "content": "At Bitcoin Plaza, on the second anniversary of the acceptance of cryptocurrency as a means of payment, in Ilopango, El Salvador, on September 7, 2023. JOSE CABEZAS / REUTERS\n\nA pitiful \"capitulation\" followed by a spectacular rebound: That could sum up 2023 for bitcoin, the best-known cryptoasset. In bad shape at the start of the year after the momentous scandal at FTX \u2013 the trading platform whose co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was mistaking customer funds for his personal wallet \u2013 it is now showing a rise of over 150% in its dollar price since the start of the year, to $45,000 (\u20ac41,000), compared with less than $17,000 a year ago.\n\nBy contrast, Wall Street's Standard & Poor's 500 index is up \"only\" 24%. The benchmark of the financial \"old world\" does still have one advantage: In December, it practically regained its all-time high, while bitcoin remains far from its own, which it reached in November 2021 at almost $68,000.\n\nBitcoin's 2023 performance is far from isolated: Many lesser-known cryptoassets, such as Ethereum and Solana, have benefited greatly in recent months from renewed investor interest.\n\nRead more Subscribers only From Praxis to Pr\u00f3spera, Silicon Valley longs to break free\n\nEasing of financial conditions in the United States\n\nAnd this trend reversal is fueling the euphoria of some industry players: Brian Armstrong, CEO of the exchange platform Coinbase, declared on December 4 on X that \"bitcoin may be the key to extending Western civilization.\" Nothing less.\n\nCrypto has come a long way: In February, three months after the collapse of FTX, the sector was targeted by the US financial authorities, who seemed determined to subject it to strict regulation. At that time, the price of bitcoin was struggling to stay above $20,000.\n\n\"The FTX crisis sounded the hour of capitulation for bitcoin,\" explained Alexandre Baradez, analyst at the broker IG. \"Once the abscess was punctured, it took a few months for the market to stabilize before entering the current bullish phase.\"\n\nRead more Subscribers only FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried found guilty of fraud\n\nThis rebound accelerated beginning in mid-October, benefiting in particular from the easing of financial conditions in the United States: The prospect of a halt to the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike, or even of a rate cut in the coming months, made assets such as gold and bitcoin, long disadvantaged by their lack of yield, more attractive.\n\nA new driving force for crypto\n\nBuoyed by monetary easing, bitcoin's return to favor was only briefly disrupted when Binance, another major international cryptoasset exchange platform, was forced to pay $4 billion in fines to close investigations into suspected violations of US anti-money-laundering laws. This outcome also forced the resignation of the company's iconic founder, Changpeng Zhao, known as \"CZ.\"\n\nRead more Crypto exchange Binance CEO pleads guilty to anti-money laundering charge\n\nIn the meantime, the bullish trend supporting crypto found a new driving force.

Yonsei Dent, a prominent crypto trader and verified author at CryptoQuant provided a unique perspective on the market dynamics, revealing intriguing insights into how both short-term and long-term investors reacted to the recent ETF-related news.\n\nBitcoin Long-Term Holders Maintain Position Despite Market Volatility\n\nProminent crypto trader Yonsei Dent analyzed the BTC market upheaval on January 3rd, triggered by negative news on the spot Bitcoin ETF. Despite the price plunge from $45,000 to $40,000, current levels stabilize around $43,000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the analysis, shared by CryptoQuant on the X platform, delves into investor behavior using the SOAB (Spent Output Age Bands) and USD indicators. Notably, short-term holders (STH) in the 1 day-6 month range spent nearly $1 billion, while exiting near Breakeven, the analysis showed.\n\nOn the other hand, the 1 month-3 month cohort, who bought BTC at the range of $26,000-$42,000, consumed approximately $550 million, realizing profits amid volatility. However, the 3M-6M cohort showed minimal movement.\n\nSurprisingly, the analysis showed that the long-time holders (LTH) in the 6M-12M range sold $7.6 billion, anticipating a stronger market decline.

        "content": "Now that 2024 has arrived, intriguing trends in the cryptocurrency industry are starting to take shape, making investors and enthusiasts reconsider the choices they make regarding investments. After significant expansion, established player Solana (SOL) is currently facing a corrective phase. Meanwhile, early adopters of Bitcoin are becoming interested in a newcomer named Pushd (PUSHD). Examining the advantages, disadvantages, and future directions of these two blockchain platforms, let\u2019s see why early adopters of Bitcoin believe Pushd could surpass Solana (SOL).\n\nSolana (SOL)\u2019s Progress and Challenges\n\nThe current status of Solana (SOL) indicates notable growth, particularly in meme coins and decentralized finance (DeFi). Although its low fees and quick transactions make it competitive in DeFi, they also create volatility. Profit-taking-driven recent correction brings the ecosystem under scrutiny as it addresses problems like scams, especially in the meme currency market.\n\nFor Solana (SOL) to continue growing, these issues need to be actively addressed. It is imperative to prioritize utility-driven applications, tighten project screening procedures, and bolster security measures. The long-term viability of Solana (SOL) depends on the community\u2019s cooperation with developers to improve network security against fraud.\n\nPushd (PUSHD): A Pioneer in Decentralized Marketplaces\n\nAmid Solana\u2019s (SOL) challenges, Pushd becomes a disruptive force in the decentralized blockchain market. During its initial presale phase, Pushd presents itself as a completely decentralized rival to established e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay. The platform will provide a seamless onboarding experience, guaranteeing privacy and quick accessibility while enabling users to transact without requiring significant verification.\n\nWith no rigorous KYC requirements, Pushd\u2019s web3 marketplace will offer a unique value proposition, allowing users to put items for sale using a variety of cryptocurrencies. The lack of KYC and quick fund release will also help sellers who frequently experience payment delays on traditional platforms, which is a common source of annoyance.\n\nInvestment Opportunities With Pushd (PUSHD) and Its Special Features\n\nInvestors in Pushd\u2019s presale get tokens at an attractive price of only $0.035 while gaining governance rights over the platform. This groundbreaking feature allows investors to propose and influence changes, enhancing the user experience. Pushd\u2019s commitment to security is evident in its successful audit and the assurance of locked liquidity for life, ensuring investor safety.\n\nPushd\u2019s ecosystem goes beyond its core marketplace functionality. It offers additional services such as a direct-pending debit card, a coin swap service with zero commission charges, a rewards program, decentralized governance, and an exclusive VIP program. This multifaceted approach positions Pushd as a comprehensive solution, aiming to redefine the decentralized marketplace experience.\n\nAs cryptocurrency evolves, Pushd is rising as a symbol of innovation and potential disruption. Positioned as a pioneer in the decentralized eCommerce space, Pushd addresses critical issues, provides unique investment opportunities, and emphasizes transparency and security. While Solana (SOL) faces challenges, Pushd presents as a promising contender, inviting early Bitcoin adopters to explore its opportunities in the ever-changing crypto landscape.\n\nFor more information about the Pushd (PUSHD) Presale, visit their website.\n\nDisclaimer: Any information written in this press release or sponsored post does not constitute investment advice.
