        "content": "Bitcoin could make a change to make the cryptocurrency more environmentally friendly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA single Bitcoin transaction could use the same amount of water needed to fill a garden swimming pool, according to a new study on the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency.\n\nIt estimates that in 2021 Bitcoin mining, used in part to create new Bitcoins, consumed over 1,600 gigalitres of water worldwide with each Bitcoin transaction using 16,000 litres of water on average.\n\nThe sheer scale of Bitcoin mining\u2019s water consumption could impact drinking water if it continues to operate without regulation, especially in countries that are already battling water scarcity, including the United States, the study published in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability on Wednesday argued.\n\nMining Bitcoin requires huge computing power to solve mathematical equations on the Internet. Correct answers are then rewarded with a share of Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nWater, which is evaporated, is used to cool the computers at large data centres and also to lower the temperature of coal-and-gas-fired power plants that also power Bitcoin mining computers.\n\n\u201cIt's just one backyard swimming pool going, going up in the air, literally evaporating on average per Bitcoin transaction,\u201d said Alex de Vries, the study\u2019s author and Ph.D. student at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\n\nThe environmental impact of mining Bitcoin has been widely documented, with the latest data from the United Nations University, showing that the crypto\u2019s energy consumption for the year 2020 was more than the total energy consumption of a country like Pakistan for the same period.\n\nHowever, how much water a Bitcoin transaction uses has been scarcely reported and is likely to increase.\n\nWith the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price to over $38,000 (\u20ac34,600), up almost five per cent in a week, de Vries said he expected Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption to also increase to 2,300 gigalitres, up more than 40 per cent compared to 2021.\n\nThe report argues this will be a problem for countries in Central Asia, such as Bitcoin mining hub Kazakhstan, where the dry climate is putting pressure on freshwater supplies.\n\nThe US also uses a lot of water for Bitcoin mining, which is responsible for consuming as much water as 300,000 US households or a city like Washington, DC, the study estimated.\n\nThe real solution and the losing game\n\nDe Vries argues that using renewable energy instead of electricity would not be a solution to reducing Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\n\u201cDo you really want to spend wind and solar power for crypto? In many countries, including the US, the amount of renewable energy is limited. Surely you can move some of these renewable energy sources to crypto, but that means something else will be powered with fossil fuels,\u201d he said.\n\nBy the year 2040, the last Bitcoin will be mined and then there's not going to be any money going to these miners. Alex de Vries Author of the study\n\nBut he argues if Bitcoin changed its technology to be more environmentally friendly, the crypto\u2019s environmental damage would reverse overnight.\n\nBitcoin uses the Proof of Work model, which works like a competitive numeric guessing game and the first person to solve the puzzle is awarded a fixed amount of cryptocurrency.\n\nIt requires a global network of computers to run at the same time when a transaction takes place and therefore a lot of energy.\n\nBut in the Proof of Stake system, you do not need the energy-consuming hardware as you acquire coins, which are put up as collateral in the staking process and there is then a random selection through the software.\n\nHow powerful your machine is does not increase your chance of winning and being able to create the next block for the blockchain. The only thing that increases your chance of winning is just getting more coins.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe second-largest crypto Ethereum made the change to Proof of Stake in 2022 and remains just as popular today.\n\nBitcoin could make the same change but de Vries argues Bitcoin miners are more traditional and do not want to rock the boat to keep their investment.\n\n\u201cNot changing stuff is what gives Bitcoin value, even though actually not changing stuff is probably the riskiest thing they can do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe amount of coins being mined just keeps decreasing. And by the year 2040, the last Bitcoin will be mined and then there's not going to be any money going to these miners.\n\n\u201cSo in the long run, they're kind of playing this losing game\u201d."

        "content": "The prospect that US residents may soon be able to invest in bitcoin through their brokerage, as if it were a regular stock, has prompted a fresh round of hype in crypto circles\u2014and a surge in crypto prices.\n\nSeveral investment firms, including heavy-hitters like BlackRock and Fidelity, are queuing up to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. These funds would track the price of bitcoin, making them the closest thing to investing in the crypto token directly without dealing with a crypto exchange or storing crypto manually, a process fraught with risk.\n\nAfter a bruising 18 months in which crypto prices buckled, high-profile businesses collapsed, and two crypto figureheads were convicted of crimes in the US, the crypto industry is supposed to be cleaning up its act. That the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be entertaining a spot bitcoin ETF after years of resistance is seen by some as a signal that crypto is moving beyond its free-wheeling years.\n\nThe arrival of such a fund in the US\u2014by far the world\u2019s largest ETF market\u2014\u201cis a significant milestone,\u201d says Samson Mow, a prominent bitcoin evangelist and CEO of bitcoin-centric technology firm JAN3, as it will allow investors to hold bitcoin through a conventional financial product for the first time.\n\nWhile there is broad consensus around the likelihood of an ETF approval among analysts, the idea that it would be symbolic of the industry\u2019s coming of age is contradicted by the frenzy of speculation around what will happen to the price of bitcoin.\n\nOn X, crypto influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers are predicting an ETF will send the price of bitcoin soaring, in posts peppered with the rocket ship emoji. The arrival of a spot bitcoin ETF, claims Mow, will unlock a wave of pent-up demand and lead a \u201ctorrent of capital\u201d to \u201cpour into bitcoin.\u201d Institutions and other investors that either cannot or choose not to invest in unregulated financial products will seize the opportunity to invest, he says, driving the price far beyond its previous heights."

        "content": "The environmental impact of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is increasingly being scrutinised, due to the vast amounts of electricity they consume. Now it seems that water use is also a big problem\n\nThe water consumed by a single bitcoin transaction could fill a small swimming pool Radharc Images / Alamy\n\nBuying or selling bitcoin uses 16,000 litres of clean water for every single transaction, which could exacerbate existing droughts around the world. While the energy consumption and carbon emissions produced by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been well studied, this is the first assessment of its water use and wider environmental impact.\n\nAlex de Vries at the VU Amsterdam School of Business and Economics in the Netherlands has calculated that mining \u2013 the computational process that secures the bitcoin network \u2013 uses between 8.6 and 35.1 billion litres of water per year in the US alone. He says that bitcoin used 1.6 trillion litres of water globally in 2021, and expects this to rise to 2.3 trillion litres this year. Broken down per transaction, that means a single bitcoin trade consumes 16,000 litres of water \u2013 enough to fill a small swimming pool. This is \u201cincreasingly hard to defend\u201d, says de Vries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe majority of the water consumption comes from electricity production, such as in coal and gas plants, or throughput in hydroelectric power stations, says de Vries. He used data on the electricity mix at locations where bitcoin mining occurs to calculate the totals, but also factored in that water is also used directly in data centres to cool the powerful hardware used by miners.\n\nWhile bitcoin\u2019s water consumption is a huge environmental problem, it pales in comparison with its energy demands, says de Vries. \u201cThe mining devices are effectively just generating random numbers all day long, and they just throw them all away and nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 useful comes out,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd while competing cryptocurrency Ethereum has introduced changes which slashed its energy use by 99.99 per cent, which would also reduce water consumption, bitcoin has been reluctant to follow suit \u2013 which is partly due to a lack of centralised control to push such decisions through.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\n\u201cThe software solution is available. It\u2019s just that you are dealing with a community that is fundamentally against any type of changes to their software,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cIf you make the change you cut the majority of everything: the carbon emissions, water footprint, electronic waste, it all goes out the window overnight. Literally, the moment you make the software change, it\u2019s all gone. Bitcoin is responsible for half a per cent of global electricity consumption, [and] we could cut this by tomorrow.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin mines aren\u2019t just energy-hungry, it turns out they\u2019re thirsty, too. The water consumption tied to a single Bitcoin transaction, on average, could be enough to fill a small backyard pool, according to a new analysis. Bitcoin mines are essentially big data centers, which have become notorious for how much electricity and water they use.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s water footprint is growing, according to the analysis published today in a commentary in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability. That\u2019s an issue to watch as the price of Bitcoin recovers from a spiraling crypto winter.\n\nBitcoin mines are essentially big data centers, which have become notorious for how much electricity and water they use.\n\nThe study was conducted by Alex de Vries, a PhD candidate at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam whose previous research has tracked cryptocurrencies\u2019 electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Those issues have moved legislators to push for more oversight of crypto mines\u2019 environmental impact. But until recently, most of that attention has been on whether energy-intensive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin might throw off countries\u2019 climate goals.\n\nBitcoin mining also has the potential to stress water resources in drought-prone areas. Miners use specialized computers to solve puzzles around the clock to validate transactions and earn Bitcoin in return. All that computing power burns through a lot of energy. And like other data centers, many crypto mines also end up using a good deal of water in their cooling systems to keep machines from overheating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of hard to surprise me, given how I\u2019ve already worked on this topic I\u2019m kind of used to big numbers popping up. But then again, the numbers are still mind blowing even to me every time I look at it,\u201d de Vries told The Verge.\n\nTo conduct his analysis, de Vries estimated the direct water use from Bitcoin mines\u2019 cooling systems. He also added their indirect water consumption associated with electricity generation, since power plants also use water in cooling systems. All in all, he found that cryptocurrency mining used about 1,600 gigaliters of water in 2021 when the price of Bitcoin peaked at over $65,000. That comes out to a small swimming pool\u2019s worth of water (16,000 liters), on average, for each transaction. It\u2019s about 6.2 million times more water than a credit card swipe, according to de Vries.\n\nOf course, everything dipped in 2022 as the price of Bitcoin plunged and mining slowed. But the price has climbed back up since last year, rising from less than $20,000 to around $38,000 today. The higher the price, the more incentive there is to ramp up mining. That\u2019s why de Vries expects the cryptocurrency\u2019s water consumption to rise to a new high of 2,300 gigaliters worldwide this year. In the US, the biggest hub for Bitcoin mining in the world, Bitcoin mining uses about as much annually as a city the size of Washington, DC.\n\nThese numbers are estimates based on the assumption that the Bitcoin mines run on water-dependent cooling systems typical in large data centers. However, some data centers and crypto mines use a different system that keeps computers cool and cuts down water consumption by immersing them in a non-conductive liquid.\n\nThere\u2019s another way to get the cryptocurrency to use a fraction of the water and electricity it eats up now and slash greenhouse gas emissions: get rid of the mining process altogether and find a new way to validate transactions. That\u2019s what the next biggest cryptocurrency network, Ethereum, accomplished last year."

Nearly all (95%) of this group say they'd consider buying more BTC in 2024. (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nRegulation is poised to be the top catalyst for both bitcoin owners and non-owners in the year ahead. When asked which factor is most likely to make them buy or strongly consider buying bitcoin in 2024, 42% of BTC owners and 35% of non-owners said increased US regulatory clarity around digital assets. Other popular factors include:\n\nSEC approval of a bitcoin spot ETF \u2014 29% of BTC owners; 13% of non-owners\n\nUS economic recession \u2014 18% of BTC owners; 12% of non-owners\n\nGuidance from a financial advisor \u2014 6% of BTC owners; 26% of non-owners\n\nNotably, US investors are largely optimistic about bitcoin\u2019s future performance, regardless of whether they own the asset. Most (79%) expect BTC to eventually pass its all-time high of $69,000, despite the asset\u2019s price being down over 50%1 from this during the survey. Over half (55%) of investors predict BTC will reach a new all-time high in 2024, with 28% believing it will be H1 and 26% saying H2 2024. Further, one-third of investors (34%) think BTC will outperform cash, gold, and the S&P 500 in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next year is likely to see a rise of bitcoin allocation in retirement portfolios, according to Unchained\u2019s survey results. While nearly half of US bitcoin owners report already having BTC in their retirement account, an additional third (35%) say they would consider adding it to their 401(k), IRA, or other plan in 2024. Among non-bitcoin owners who are open to investing in the asset, 23% say they would consider adding BTC to their retirement account next year.\n\n\"At Unchained, we are seeing an influx of bitcoin newcomers who now understand that the asset has longevity,\" said Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained. \"As reflected in both Unchained\u2019s survey results and the activity of our clients, US investors are eager to gain or expand bitcoin exposure \u2014 especially through tax-advantaged vehicles like Unchained\u2019s bitcoin IRA.

        "title": "1 Top Crypto Stock to Buy for Bitcoin Exposure - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Investing in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTCUSD), has helped investors derive game-changing returns over the past decade. Bitcoin prices have surged 120x in the last eight years, 7x in the last five years, and more than doubled in 2023. Despite these market-thumping returns, Bitcoin is also down 40% from all-time highs, allowing investors to buy the dip.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, which means it is not governed by any regulatory authority such as a central bank. It uses peer-to-peer technology and blockchain technology to record transactions - effectively, a distributed public ledger that can be verified or accessed by anyone. Miners verify and process these transactions and are rewarded with a set amount of BTC, as well as transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin was created 15 years ago, and the first block was mined in January 2009. The total supply of BTC is limited to 21 million, making it deflationary in nature. More than 19 million BTC have already been mined and are in circulation.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to this alternate asset class by purchasing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN). Further, you can buy shares of Coinbase and other crypto-related stocks to gain exposure to digital assets by proxy.\n\nAnother way is to buy shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which acts as a Bitcoin holding company. Let\u2019s see why.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nMicroStrategy Goes Big on Bitcoin\n\nValued at $7.34 billion by market cap, MicroStrategy provides enterprise-facing analytics software and services. In Q3 of 2023, MicroStrategy reported revenue of $129.5 million, an increase of 3.3% year over year.\n\nWhile it is involved in the enterprise software segment, the CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, is quite bullish on Bitcoin, and has famously allocated significant company resources to purchase BTC over the years. While MSTR has $45 million in cash, it also holds 140,000 Bitcoin worth over $4.4 billion at current prices.\n\nMicroStrategy is among the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, and first began purchasing the digital asset as a hedge against inflation back in August 2020. In fact, MicroStrategy has also raised debt to fund its BTC purchases, and now owns 0.75% of the total Bitcoin circulating supply.\n\nWill Bitcoin Prices Keep Rising In 2024?\n\nIt's evident that the price of MSTR stock will be tied to the performance of Bitcoin. For instance, BTC prices have risen 129% year-to-date, while MSTR is up 259% in 2023.\n\nThere are two key drivers for BTC in the near term. First is the possible launch of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs by institutions such as BlackRock (BLK), Invesco (IVZ), and Ark Invest. With trillions of dollars in assets under management, there is a good chance for Bitcoin demand to move higher once the ETFs are approved, possibly within the next six months.\n\nAnother positive catalyst for BTC prices is the upcoming halving event. Every four years, the amount of BTC that can be mined is reduced by 50%, resulting in an extended bull run due to the supply-demand economics.\n\nHere's a look at how Bitcoin has performed over the last three halving cycles.\n\nBitcoin prices surged over 5,000% between November 2011 and November 2013\n\nBitcoin prices again surged by over 5,000% between November 2015 and December 2017\n\nBitcoin prices rose 600% between November 2019 and November 2021\n\nIf you're bullish on Bitcoin, it makes sense to buy MSTR right now. Each of the four analysts tracking MicroStrategy stock has a \u201cstrong buy\u201d recommendation. The average price target for MSTR is $516, which is only about 1% higher than the current trading price. However, BTIG sees about 10% upside, and called MSTR the best vehicle for institutional investors to gain BTC exposure in a recent note.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bitcoin is well on its way to hitting $100,000 by the end of 2024, Standard Chartered said.\n\nThe token has increased its share of the digital asset space, while miners are selling less.\n\nMeanwhile, the increased likelihood of US spot ETFs has been a positive surprise.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

The bounce has ignited broader interest in the crypto space sooner than anticipated.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Going forward, then, we expect digital assets' rising overall market cap to be a bigger driver of BTC price upside than a continued rise in BTC dominance within the space,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of mined bitcoin have dropped to around 80% in the fourth quarter, as miners tend to hold larger quantities of the token as its price rises.\n\nNew supply will also be diminished by next April's bitcoin halving, a recurring event that reduces the amount of tokens awarded for mining. Typically, prices peak 12-18 months after it occurs, Kendrick said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a positive surprise is also emerging from the demand side, given the rising likelihood that bitcoin spot ETFs become approved for US markets, he added.\n\n\"We now expect more price upside to materialize before the halving than we previously did, specifically via the earlier-than-expected introduction of US spot ETFs. This suggests a risk that the USD 100,000 level could be reached before end-2024,\" Kendrick wrote.\n\nThat's as the SEC's attempts to block spot ETFs have suffered a number of court losses. The ETFs would bring fresh capital into bitcoin, as they would allow traditional brokerage accounts access to the cryptocurrency.\n\nFalling Treasury yields can further propel bitcoin, given that crypto tends to be a very long-term trade, Kendrick added. The 30-year yield has dropped to 4.60% from last month's high of 5.17%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStandard Chartered's bullishness was recently joined by analysts at Bernstein, who predicted that bitcoin could hit $150,000 by mid-2025 given similar supply reasons."

Geoff Kendrick and the team at the bank conveyed their confidence that the approval of various spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States will serve as the next driving force behind the cryptocurrency's expansion, with these events expected to happen earlier than initially foreseen.\n\nThe bank anticipates that multiple spot ETFs for both BTC and ETH will likely be granted approval in the first quarter of 2024, thereby paving the way for heightened institutional investment. Furthermore, Standard Chartered emphasized the forthcoming Bitcoin \"halving,\" an event that restricts the currency's supply and is predicted to occur in late April 2024, as an additional factor that could contribute to potential price increases.\n\nStandard Chartered originally predicted BTC will hit $120,000 by end of next year, attributing Bitcoin's triumph to its status as a reputable safe haven asset. The bank maintains BTC's dominance, stating: \u201cBTC\u2019s dominance remains intact \u2013 its share of overall digital assets market cap has increased to 50% from 45% in April.\"\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "One in Four Americans Own Bitcoin: Unchained Study - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Unchained, a prominent Bitcoin financial services provider, released a new report today showcasing an interesting surge in bitcoin ownership among Americans. According to their findings, a one in four Americans and 55% of surveyed investors, defined by Unchained as those with at least one investment account between the ages of 18 and 78, own bitcoin.\n\nThe study, which surveyed 402 US investors, revealed that 95% of current BTC owners are considering increasing their holdings in 2024. Remarkably, almost half of non-BTC owners expressed a strong inclination towards purchasing bitcoin within the upcoming year.\n\nKey drivers influencing potential BTC purchases in 2024 include increased regulatory clarity around digital assets, with 42% of current BTC owners and 35% of non-owners highlighting this factor. Other influential elements identified were the potential approval of a bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the anticipation of a US economic recession.\n\nDespite BTC's price being down over 50% from its peak, 79% of investors foresee BTC surpassing its all-time high of $69,000. More optimistically, over half of the surveyed investors (55%) predict a new all-time high for BTC in 2024, with a third believing BTC will outperform cash, gold, and the S&P 500.\n\nUnchained's survey also foresees a significant rise in bitcoin allocation within retirement portfolios. Nearly half of current BTC owners have BTC in their retirement accounts, and an additional 35% are considering adding it in 2024. Among non-BTC owners open to investing in the asset, 23% expressed interest in including BTC in their retirement accounts.\n\n\u201cAt Unchained, we are seeing an influx of bitcoin newcomers who now understand that the asset has longevity,\u201d stated Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained. \u201cAs reflected in both Unchained\u2019s survey results and the activity of our clients, US investors are eager to gain or expand bitcoin exposure \u2014 especially through tax-advantaged vehicles like Unchained\u2019s bitcoin IRA. As more investors look to open or grow their bitcoin positions, Unchained looks forward to serving them whether it be through collaborative custody, the Unchained IRA, our trading desk, or our inheritance solutions.\u201d\n\nWith an estimated 158 million Americans owning investment accounts, Unchained's survey provides valuable insights, representing the US investor population with a 5% margin of error at a 95% confidence level. The survey, conducted digitally from October 26 to 28, 2023, during a period when the price of bitcoin ranged from $33,610 to $34,977, offers a compelling outlook on BTC sentiment and expectations for 2024.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "What Is Block Time?\n\nBlock time measures the time it takes the miners or validators within a network to verify transactions within one block and produce a new block in that blockchain.\n\nBlockchains were first popularized by Bitcoin when it was introduced in 2009. The technology has grown as more cryptocurrencies are created, each of which can use a different or identical blockchain, validation methods, and techniques for creating new blocks.\n\nKey Takeaways Block time is the time it takes to process a block in a cryptocurrency blockchain.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, a block is verified by miners, who compete against each other to verify the transactions and solve the hash, which creates another block.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, a block is validated by randomly selected nodes, which is must faster because there is no competition.\n\nOther chains might use different mechanisms, which would affect their block times.\n\nUnderstanding Block Time\n\nA blockchain is a distributed database that records all transactions within a cryptocurrency network. You can think of a block within the database as a cell in a spreadsheet where transaction information is stored. Bitcoin miners verify the transactions, which takes time because finding the solution to the encryption problem requires the computers to make a vast number of trial-and-error attempts.\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, this is called hashing\u2014generating random hexadecimal numbers to try and find one that is less than or equal to one set by the network. When the block solution is found or otherwise validated, a new block is opened. The amount of time it takes to find the solution and create a new block is the block time.\n\n\n\nHere are a few key points to remember if you're trying to understand block time:\n\nA block is a record of the most recent cryptocurrency transactions, similar to a cell in a table of columns and rows.\n\nEach block contains the information from the block that preceded it in hashed form (that's why it is theoretically impossible to alter cryptocurrency).\n\nOn the Bitcoin blockchain, cryptocurrency \"miners\" race against each other to generate a random hash plus the nonce that is less than or equal to the target hash. The winner receives a reward.\n\nEthereum validators use a different consensus mechanism, which makes the block times shorter.\n\nBlockchains that use other mechanisms may have shorter or longer block times.\n\nWhy Block Times Differ\n\nConsensus mechanisms are what allow a network of participants to agree that a transaction is valid. Cryptocurrencies can use different consensus mechanisms, which, among other factors, affect the time it takes to verify transactions and create new blocks.\n\nProof-of-work and proof-of-stake are two types of consensus mechanisms that use different transaction verification methods. Each blockchain has a different block time because of the way their mechanisms work\u2014Bitcoin averages about 10 minutes, while Ethereum only takes around 12 seconds.\n\nThe exact amount of time it takes for block generation on the Bitcoin proof-of-work blockchain is governed by the difficulty level, which changes with network traffic and the number of miners on the network to keep block times at 10 minutes.\n\nEthereum uses proof-of-stake, which is much faster because there is no competition for a reward\u2014participants with staked ether are randomly selected to validate the transactions and receive network fees.\n\nBlock Time vs. Confirmation Time\n\nSometimes confused with each other, block times and confirmation times are two different measurements on a blockchain. Confirmation time is the amount of time it takes a blockchain to confirm a transaction.\n\nIt's often thought that a transaction needs six confirmations before it goes through; however, this is a misunderstanding. When a transaction makes it into a block, and the block is closed, the transaction has one confirmation and concludes. The number six comes from the belief that a transaction that was confirmed six times (included in six closed blocks) is secure from any network attacks.\n\nA block may be opened every 10 minutes on the Bitcoin blockchain, but not all transactions that occur within that period can be sent to the current block to be mined and confirmed. Confirmation can take up to several hours on the Bitcoin blockchain because transactions are sent to a mempool, where they are queued in order of the amount of fees paid.\n\nUsers who want their transactions placed in front of others pay more than the average, while those who pay average or below-average fees must wait their turn to be sent to a block, verified, and confirmed at least once.\n\n\n\nHow Many Bitcoins Will Ever Be Created? Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million. There are over 19 million Bitcoins in circulation, and the number of Bitcoins created yearly halves every four years. This slows down Bitcoin creation over time.\n\nHow Many Ethereum Will Ever Be Created? Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, doesn't have an upper limit on the number of coins that will be created.\n\nHow Do I Get a Bitcoin Block? You never actually receive a Bitcoin block since it is part of Bitcoin's framework. Instead, you receive a reward of bitcoin when your miner solves the hash and creates another block.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlocks are one of the structures used in a blockchain that store information. The time it takes to open a new block on a chain is that chain's block time. Block times differ from confirmation times, which can take several hours or days to complete.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Can Head Higher in 2024. Here's Why - Nasdaq",
        "content": "What a difference a year can make. Last year, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) lost nearly two-thirds of its value, and skeptics were ready to leave it for dead. This year, Bitcoin has come roaring back with a torrid gain of 128% in 2023. While 2023 has been a momentous year for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it can head even higher next year based on two potential catalysts that could both occur in early 2024: its upcoming halving and the potential for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. I'm bullish on BTC.\n\nGet Ready for The Halving\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving event is expected to occur in April 2024. What does the halving entail?\n\nHalvings are scheduled events that take place every four years, in which the reward for mining a new block of Bitcoin is cut in half. Right now, Bitcoin miners receive a reward of 6.25 new Bitcoins for each block that they mine. After the halving, this reward will be reduced to 3.125 BTC.\n\nThere are only 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist, and this fixed supply is one of Bitcoin's primary selling points. Unlike fiat currencies, which governments and central banks can always print more of, Bitcoin is a finite resource. The halving helps to curb Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate and ensures that Bitcoin becomes increasingly scarce over time, which should theoretically increase its value over time.\n\nTo be clear, nothing is guaranteed, but past halvings have typically ushered in significant bull markets for Bitcoin. During the first Bitcoin halving in 2012, the block reward decreased from 50 BTC to 25 BTC, and the price of Bitcoin increased from about $12 before the halving to over $960 one year later.\n\nDuring the second Bitcoin halving in 2016, the reward decreased from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, and the price of Bitcoin nearly quadrupled one year later, from $663 to about $2,500.\n\nLastly, during the most recent halving, which occurred in 2020, the block reward decreased from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, and the price of Bitcoin went parabolic, rising from about $8,500 before the halving to an all-time high of around $69,000 in November of 2021.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin came down considerably from this all-time high, and past results are no guarantee of future results. However, this illustrates the effect that past halvings have had on the price of Bitcoin. Based on these results, it\u2019s easy to see why crypto market participants are enthusiastic about the next halving.\n\nImpact of a Potential Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nIt\u2019s not just the halving that could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin in 2024. Some market observers believe that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC is becoming increasingly likely and that it will come in early 2024.\n\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) kicked off the excitement this summer with its spot Bitcoin ETF filing and was soon followed by a mix of traditional finance giants like Fidelity and Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), tech-centric ARK Invest, and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC), which is seeking to convert its trust into an ETF. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have forecasted a 90% likelihood that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved for trading by January 2024.\n\nBalchunas has noted that ARK Invest, BlackRock, and others are updating their S1 filings, which could be a good sign, as it means that these issuers are getting their applications in shape for approval. Balchunas and other observers have also noted that BlackRock and others have been meeting with the SEC to hash out details and that this dialogue is another good sign.\n\nIt should be pointed out that this is all speculation at this point, but the developments do seem encouraging.\n\nTo be clear, speculation and excitement about the possibility of such an ETF has already driven the price of Bitcoin higher in 2024. The current Bitcoin rally really kicked into overdrive this summer after news of BlackRock's filing broke.\n\nWhile this could potentially make an approval a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" event in the short term, over the long term, a spot Bitcoin ETF would usher in a new era for Bitcoin.\n\nMillions of U.S. investors would be able to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin through their brokerage or retirement accounts for the first time, making the process of gaining Bitcoin exposure as simple as buying a stock or an ETF.\n\nThis would open up access to Bitcoin to investors who are interested in it or bullish on its long-term potential but who don\u2019t want to manage their own Bitcoin wallet or open up a dedicated crypto brokerage account with Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) or another provider. These ETFs could also bring more institutional investors into Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, ETFs from recognizable and trusted blue-chip names in the traditional finance world, like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others who have filed, would make many investors feel more comfortable with Bitcoin and boost its credibility with mainstream, non-crypto investors.\n\nLooking Ahead to 2024\n\nBitcoin has had an epic run in 2023, but 2024 could see it add to these gains based on two major potential catalysts: the Bitcoin halving, which has historically led to bullish price action for Bitcoin, and the possibility of the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which would potentially open Bitcoin up to a whole new pool of investors and bring it even further into the mainstream.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be risky and volatile investments, so they are not for the faint of heart. I own Bitcoin and am bullish on it. For long-term, risk-tolerant investors, I like the idea of adding some diversification to portfolios by adding some Bitcoin ahead of these events.\n\nDisclosure\n\n\n\n\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Finance spawns a lot of weird and wonky words, and while I\u2019ve at least heard of most of them, \u201cuplist\u201d is a new one for me. I encountered it while poking into crypto giant Grayscale\u2019s bid to be first out of the gate with a Bitcoin ETF\u2014an achievement that would likely help the crypto giant nab the lion\u2019s share of a new market expected to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nWhile other firms, notably BlackRock and Fidelity, are seeking a similar prize, Grayscale is the only one in a position to do it by means of an uplist. The term refers to moving a securities listing from an off-brand stock exchange onto a mainstream one. In Grayscale\u2019s case, this would mean moving its GBTC shares from something called OTCQX to the familiar confines of the NYSE, while at the same time converting its jerry-rigged trust product to a regular old ETF.\n\nA source at Grayscale tells me that launching via an uplist means the firm could bring its ETF to market slightly quicker than its competitors\u2014a critical advantage since, historically, the first ETF in a given field sucks up most of the liquidity. I have no idea if this will happen (and would point any diehards to the X feeds of Bloomberg ETF guys Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart or lawyer Scott Johnsson). But it does underscore how much is at stake with the long-awaited arrival of Bitcoin ETFs, which are widely expected to drop in early January based on the whims of the SEC.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other wild cards surrounding Grayscale\u2019s ETF bid, including what the company plans to charge. It\u2019s a safe bet the fee will be lower than the 2% it\u2019s long charged for GBTC, especially as one of its competitors in the ETF race, ARK Invest, says it will charge 0.8%. Competitive dynamics suggest Grayscale would have to match that rate, but the reality is the firm is likely to charge more since most customers tempted to exchange Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF for a competitor\u2019s would set off a tax trip wire\u2014meaning many will choose to grit their teeth and hold instead.\n\nThe final wild card in all this is how many of those currently holding GBTC shares will simply dump them once the ETF drops, and ditch the Bitcoin game altogether. Recall that a sizable group of investors bought Grayscale shares as an arbitrage when they were trading far below the price of Bitcoin in hopes the gap would close. That has happened\u2014the so-called discount has closed from over 40% to 8% and is likely to disappear altogether\u2014meaning some investors are going to take their crypto profits and go take a flier on AI or something else totally unrelated. JPMorgan recently predicted outflows will amount to around $2.7 billion.\n\nAll of this is just conjecture for now. But January, and some real answers, are only weeks away.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nA U.S. judge has for now refused to let Binance\u2019s former CEO return to the United Arab Emirates ahead of his sentencing date in February, and will likely make a decision in the coming days.

This situation could make risk assets like bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher returns in a lower interest rate environment,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block.\n\nHowever, the analysts added that other narratives are at play. \"Long-term bitcoin supply has continued to remain dormant while the lower timeframes currently show aggressive market participants chasing price, market buying, above the crucial $37,500 level. This resilience might also be reflecting in ether's performance, along with bitcoin steadily trading above $37,500.\" the analysts said."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 40% over the last three months. Investors are waiting to hear if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin ETF, with inflows into the cryptocurrency surging the last five weeks. Yahoo Finance Reporter Jared Blikre joins the Live show to break down the numbers and give insight into whether or not this bitcoin rally can continue into next year.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right. Let's take a look at the crypto market because Bitcoin bulls are ready to charge. Bitcoin looking for direction this morning as investors' anticipation over an eventual US spot Bitcoin ETF, has pushed the cryptocurrency higher in the last three months. The question now, though, is whether this rally has staying power into the new year. Jared Blikre joining us with maybe a closer look at some of those technicals and the momentum that we've seen. Jared, what do you think?\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, I'm looking at inflows into Bitcoin and this chart goes back to the beginning of the year. And we are on the ninth straight week of inflows into Bitcoin, approaching about $300 million. This is the highest week of the year. And just looking, we can see a lot of activity over the last five weeks. Why? Whatever happened five weeks ago? We got a huge breakout in price.\n\nAnd let's go to the Bitcoin chart. And let's do a year to date. And we can plot this, you can see we really got going in about mid-October here. And you can even see that better with the candlesticks. We got that huge break above 30,000 and then 35,000. Huge, huge sticking points. And the reason those were sticking points is because there is a lot of price memory.\n\nLet me change this back to a line chart. And you can see we are now firmly in the bottom area of all this price history that we had in 2021. Lots of things sorted out in there. Suffice to say, it's going to take a lot to get through there.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs it going to happen slowly, quickly? Depends on the catalyst. But the regulatory environment finally seems to be getting a little bit more habitable for crypto players. It looks like Binance is probably going to skate with a $4 billion fine. But the industry itself is going to survive. And they've taken their lumps over the last couple of years. For the industry to bounce back now, I'd say yes, the bad, the worst is definitely in the past. And there's a lot of smooth sailing ahead. But exactly how that plays out, it's hard to see.\n\nI think the spot Bitcoin ETF, that's probably priced in. But you never know. There could be another burst of enthusiasm around that. Anecdotally, I will say the only time I get recognized in the streets of New York is when crypto prices are popping, and I'm not getting recognized. So I know we haven't gotten that level-- gotten to that level in this cycle yet.\n\nSEANA SMITH: It's weird. I didn't know you were so tied to the crypto. I never would have guessed that.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Apparently, I am personally levered to Bitcoin prices. I don't know what's in that, but that's the way it happens. So I started getting recognized, yeah, I'll be really bullish, but we're just in the beginning stages right now, guys.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: All right, Jared Blikre. We will have to put a pin in that one and come back to you. We'll watch out for you for your man on the street Bitcoin quote.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: That's a great idea, Diane. Man on the street, person on the street Bitcoin. We're going to do that.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: Exactly. All right, thank you, Jared."

        "title": "Bitcoin flirts with breakout, price mirrors lead-up to 2012 halving - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin is eyeing a price breakout after clearing $38,200 earlier today, reaching its highest point in 17 months.\n\nThat puts bitcoin up 130% this year, far more than almost all other top-25 cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC only trails bitcoin cash (BCH), chainlink (LINK) and solana (SOL), which were up 133%, 163% and 508%, respectively, as of 5am ET.\n\nFor scale, bitcoin\u2019s year-to-date gains are in line with Tesla stock and double Intel and Microsoft.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is meanwhile up more than 230% on the back of artificial intelligence hype, which made it the ninth company in history to reach trillion-dollar market value. Crypto\u2019s overall market cap is now close to $1.5 trillion, with bitcoin making up more than half of that total.\n\nNailing down the exact catalyst for bitcoin\u2019s recent growth is difficult, however.\n\nClick the swatches to toggle lines on the chart\n\nThe pending suite of applications for spot bitcoin ETFs from Wall Street mega giant BlackRock and nearly a dozen other firms is one theory. \u201cSpot bitcoin\u201d means they\u2019ll have to actually buy bitcoin when they issue new shares to meet investor demand, which may or may not pick up, depending on which analyst you ask.\n\nBitcoin indeed jumped by nearly a quarter \u2014 from $25,500 to $31,500 \u2014 days after BlackRock filed in June. Low liquidity led BTC to quickly drop, and by the middle of August had practically given up all those gains.\n\nBTC has popped by half since then. Almost all of that came directly after a fake news headline suggested that BlackRock\u2019s application had been approved (it hasn\u2019t).\n\nOne month later, a phony story about an XRP ETF briefly pumped the fifth-largest crypto by 10%. XRP immediately corrected once the news was debunked.\n\nBitcoin price is correlating with 2012 halving\n\nMarkets are clearly ready to bounce on any good news \u2014 like the upcoming halving.\n\nSometime around April 19, 2024, Bitcoin miners will suddenly earn 50% fewer coins for each block they find, dropping from 6.25 BTC ($238,000) to 3,125 BTC ($119,000).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving will be its fourth ever. To some, halvings are magic: Previous events \u2014 in 2012, 2016 and 2020 \u2014 all preceded monumental bull markets.\n\nHit the log button for a clearer view\n\nAt one year after each halving, Bitcoin had rallied:\n\n8,900% after its first halving ($12 to $1,100).\n\n285% after its second ($670 to $2,500).\n\n540% after its third ($8,700 to $55,900).\n\nBitcoin even went up in the 200 days leading up to all three occasions \u2014 so no matter how you cut it, BTC\u2019s price has gone up around halvings.\n\nThis time around is even somewhat unique: demand could go up due to a spot ETF just as supply is slashed in half.\n\nStill, buying bitcoin around the halvings is much like buying the rumor with no intention to sell the news. The sample size is incredibly small, leaving little room for reliable analysis of how the halving in April might impact bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s performance is so far in line with what happened before the 2012 event\n\nBitcoin miners, no doubt, hope the next halving mirrors the others. Axing issuance is expected to crush their profit margins, especially those without extremely cheap access to power (or even their own power stations).\n\nRecent estimates suggest the most efficient bitcoin miners pay $15,100 to mine each coin. That number doubles after the halving, \u201cwhich would likely put the majority of the mining market into severe income stress,\u201d according to data unit Glassnode.\n\nAll this means bitcoin had better stay above $30,000 after the next halving, which is 141 days away. So far, so good.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Do We Really Need a Spot Bitcoin ETF? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission has been one of the most talked about investing topics in 2023. Will they approve? If so, when? Will the approval be for one issuer at first, or several at once? And is the recent rise in bitcoin\u2019s price due in large part to anticipation of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval?\n\nThese questions have many corners of the financial markets buzzing. But here\u2019s another take on it: While the ETF industry would benefit from having a spot bitcoin ETF, and investors would finally be able to buy the cryptocurrency at nearly the spot price, are the current products so bad?\n\nThe push for ETFs to track the spot price of bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, has led the crypto industry to the brink of victory, with many expecting an approval by early next year. But when we look at the return history of existing bitcoin-related ETFs, it does make a case for leaving well enough alone.\n\nThe Case for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a closed-end unit trust, is the first exchange-traded product that attempted to track the price of bitcoin. It debuted back in 2014, well ahead of most others. That early adopter move has helped it reach $23 billion in assets and trade at a daily average volume of $135 million.\n\nBut GBTC has trailed the spot price of bitcoin badly. The margin over the past 36 months has been 120% to 50%. That does not qualify as a tracking ETF to many. Yet the assets have ballooned. That one case argues for a spot bitcoin ETF to be available immediately. But wait, there\u2019s more to the story.\n\nThe Case for Futures-Based Bitcoin ETFs\n\nA trio of lesser-known ETFs, the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BTF), use futures to track the price of bitcoin. BITO has $1.4 billion in assets, but the other two combined have only about $100 million. All three have been around since at least November 16, 2021, long enough to assess how closely they correlate to spot bitcoin itself. It also includes a series of rallies and drops for bitcoin, which helps make this a stronger stress test.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe results are compelling. In that period of just over two years, BTC is down 41%. All three of the ETFs mentioned are down 39%-40%. There have been short periods of time where the ETFs have outperformed the spot price of BTC and vice versa. But all things considered, if an investor wants to own something that correlates with bitcoin\u2019s spot price, these three have done a very good job.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF vs. GBTC\n\nOne of the main reasons ETFs have grown in popularity over the years is that investors know what they are getting. If an ETF aims to track an index, it tracks that index closely. So, until there is a spot bitcoin ETF, there\u2019s no direct tracking of bitcoin. But we do currently have some ways for investors to track the intermediate term path of bitcoin closely, albeit with some tracking error along the way.\n\nInvestors have flocked to the GBTC, the bitcoin-tracking ETF that correlates to the spot price of BTC at a rate of more than 25-1 in terms of assets. GBTC has had a monster run in 2023, up about twice what spot bitcoin is, helping it make up its previous lagging performance. But no doubt there are bitcoin ETFs for investors to choose from if the goal is to get a piece of the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential upside, whether we have a spot ETF or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "\u201cIf people weren\u2019t so often wrong, we wouldn\u2019t be so rich,\u201d Charlie Munger, the right-hand man of the billionaire stock picker Warren Buffett, once said of rival investors.\n\nIt was that humour, paired with decades of investment successes, that endeared Munger to a global business community now in mourning after news of his death at the age of 99 on Tuesday night.\n\nBest known for serving as vice-chair of the textile manufacturer turned $785bn (\u00a3619bn) investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was credited with shifting Buffett\u2019s strategy from buying up cheap, undervalued assets, towards selecting quality stocks such as Apple. The change made multibillionaires of both men.\n\nBut in his 50 years working alongside his business partner, Munger also garnered fans for his quick wit and no-holds-barred comments that led Buffett to write in 2000: \u201cMiss Manners clearly would need to do a lot of work on Charlie.\u201d\n\nMunger\u2019s comedic targets were wide-ranging, spanning graduate schools that he claimed taught poor investment strategies to the US government for failing to crack down on cryptocurrencies, and bankers whom, after the 2008 financial crisis, he likened to \u201cheroin addicts\u201d struggling to control their habit.\n\nMunger, who married twice and had seven children, refused to entertain new accounting methods such as Ebitda, which, rather than presenting bottom-line profits, shows a business\u2019s earnings before a series of costs: interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. \u201cI think you would understand any presentation using the word Ebitda if every time you saw that word you just substituted the phrase \u2018bullshit earnings\u2019,\u201d he once said.\n\nHe similarly hit out at the valuation of investment products such as derivatives, which are contracts linked to the expected future price of assets like gold, oil or company stocks. \u201cTo say that derivative accounting in America is sewage is an insult to sewage,\u201d the billionaire once quipped.\n\nBorn on New Year\u2019s Day in 1924 to Florence and Alfred Munger, he grew up a few blocks down from Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska, but he would only meet his future business partner decades later, in 1959.\n\nMunger studied mathematics before dropping out of the University of Michigan and later joining the US army air corps. While in the military he was sent to study meteorology at the California Institute of Technology, and he later attended Harvard law school in 1948. He would go on to form the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in 1962, the same year he launched the hedge fund Wheeler, Munger & Co.\n\nThree years earlier, Munger, then 35, had met Buffett, then 29. The two Omahans hit it off and stayed in touch for more than two decades before finally formalising their business relationship when Munger joined Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s board in 1978.\n\nBuffett, known as the Sage of Omaha, spoke warmly of his longtime colleague, saying in 2018 that the two \u201cnever had an argument in the entire time we\u2019ve known each other\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cCharlie has given me the ultimate gift that a person can give to somebody else. He\u2019s made me a better person than I would have otherwise been \u2026 He\u2019s given me a lot of good advice over time ... I\u2019ve lived a better life because of Charlie.\u201d\n\nThe duo\u2019s comedic chemistry was palpable, often drawing laughs and applause from investors who regularly made the pilgrimage to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting held in the pair\u2019s home town each May.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well,\u201d he told investors at this year\u2019s meeting.\n\nHowever, he reserved more cutting comments for traders taking a punt on crypto assets such as bitcoin, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s like somebody else trading turds and you decide I can\u2019t be left out.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, he added: \u201cI hate the bitcoin success and I don\u2019t welcome a currency that\u2019s useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth.\u201d\n\nMunger, whom Forbes estimated to be worth $2.6bn, regularly doled out aphorisms that would be collected for books and video compilations by adoring fans. They included: \u201cCapitalism without failure is like religion without hell\u201d; \u201cWithout the method of learning, you\u2019re like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest\u201d; and \u201cThe best armour of old age is a well-spent life preceding it\u201d.\n\nOf late, the billionaire was realistic about the prospects for the next generation of investors, saying: \u201cThere is so much money now in the hands of so many smart people all trying to outsmart one another. It\u2019s a radically different world from the world we started in.\u201d"

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is an exciting frontier that's still new. Bitcoin (BTC -3.38%) has only been around since 2009, and crypto as a whole has been relevant for just the past decade or so.\n\nSometimes, timing is everything. Two years ago, Bitcoin traded at more than $60,000. Had I asked whether the coin could climb to $100,000, you might have said it was going to the moon. Today, you might answer differently. Bitcoin has since plummeted, falling as much as 75% from its peak.\n\nNow, trading at just under $40,000... can Bitcoin reach $100,000? Here is why you should be optimistic.\n\nBitcoin's volatility is normal\n\nBitcoin has proven volatile over the years. It's suffered several drops from its high of more than 60%. Why? Bitcoin and crypto as a whole is a unique asset. Stocks represent underlying businesses, and governments assign value to fiat money. All these assets trade on markets, but Bitcoin depends solely on what buyers and sellers are willing to pay.\n\nGiven its decentralized nature, it makes sense that Bitcoin could see higher prices when markets are feeling good and lower prices when markets are afraid. In other words, the volatility is normal.\n\nThe key, of course, is where prices go over time. Bitcoin is also a unique asset because there is a finite supply. If more people use and want Bitcoin in the future, higher demand should create higher prices. This is the central investment thesis for holding Bitcoin.\n\nShedding crypto's bad actors\n\nThere are both pros and cons to a decentralized asset like cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, the lack of guardrails in the industry attracted bad actors, scammers, and criminals. This goes far beyond the occasional sketchy crypto project where the developers abandon the investors (a rug pull).\n\nThe world's top two largest cryptocurrency exchanges have been mired in controversy. Sam Bankman-Fried was recently found guilty of fraud and conspiracy. He founded and grew his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, which collapsed during a liquidity crisis after he misappropriated customer and investor money.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, recently settled with the U.S. government on money laundering charges. Its founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has stepped down.\n\nThese are tremendous, ground-shaking events for the industry. Could one imagine what would happen if it turned out Bank of America was running a fraud and collapsed? On the other hand, this could be healthy for the crypto space in the long run. Getting the bad apples out of the basket could build trust in crypto, ultimately advancing it.\n\nCan Bitcoin reach $100,000?\n\nThere's no doubt that Bitcoin can reach $100,000, but the real question is... will it? Personally, I think it will eventually. The collapse of these huge, fraudulent crypto exchanges may seem damaging, but cleaning it up could create a healthier crypto industry.\n\nA healthier industry could help Bitcoin go to new levels because the central thesis of Bitcoin remains intact. It's an asset with a limited supply, so increased adoption of and demand for Bitcoin will naturally increase what the market is willing to pay.\n\nOf course, investors should keep their portfolios diversified across asset classes, including crypto, stocks, and bonds. If you're holding Bitcoin, don't make it a higher percentage of your total portfolio than you would any other stock. Bitcoin isn't a get-rich-quick scheme, but an emerging asset that must prove itself over the coming years."

Getty Images\n\nBitcoin climbed above $38,161 on Wednesday, its highest mark in 18 months.\n\nIn a bullish signal for investors, market expectations have ramped up for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024.\n\nStandard Chartered forecasted bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of next year.\n\nBitcoin rose 1% on Wednesday to reach $38,168, its highest level since April and May 2022, when prices were collapsing amid a brutal bear market.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has climbed more than 10% in November, supported by market expectations for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in 2024.\n\nEasing monetary policy should be more a bullish tailwind for digital assets, as investors typically pull back from riskier investments when interest rates climb.\n\nIn 2023 so far, bitcoin is up about 130%, and Wall Street is bullish that more big gains are on the way.\n\nStandard Chartered said Tuesday that bitcoin is on track to hit $100,000 by the end of 2024, reiterating an earlier forecast. Meanwhile, technical analyst Katie Stockton said bitcoin could be poised for another surge in the coming weeks.\n\n\"Bitcoin would resolve its consolidation phase higher with a move above $38,000, which would act as a catalyst for a test of $42,200 resistance,\" Stockton told clients earlier this week.\n\nCrypto traders are also still hoping to see the Securities and Exchange Commission approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Institutional players including Fidelity and BlackRock have lined up for the regulatory greenlight, while Grayscale earlier this year won a key legal battle against the SEC.\n\nAnother bullish event on the horizon is the April 2024 halving, which is when the amount of bitcoin produced via mining is cut in half.\n\nIn the 12 months following the prior three halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020, bitcoin skyrocketed 8,069%, 284%, and 559%, respectively.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

We are now north of $38,000. This is the highest level we have seen for Bitcoin going back to May of 2022. So it's been about a year and a half ether, Of course, taking part in this rally, though it has been lagging behind the recent rally we have seen in Bitcoin in Bitcoin to a large degree, it's up by about 2.9% on the day in that action. And really across the digital asset space, you're seeing tokens moving higher is feeding back into crypto related equities, one of them being Marathon digital. It's higher by about seven and a half percent on the day. And Coinbase generally one I know you're paying a lot of attention to, it's up by about 6% at this point in the session. Coinbase has really been lighting up the internet as well. A lot of people talking about it on the platform now known as X. And remember, it has not only been up every day since we've seen struggles that big multibillion dollar settlement over at big rival Binance, it's actually been on quite a tear, Kelly, since it's hit its October lows again, Of course, some of that some of that is helped by that love in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But really, it's almost an 80% rise since it retested its lows in October. And if you pull out the chart even more, you would see that it's nearly quadrupled since its December lows that it hit last year. It's too soon to see just how much those troubles over Binance have meant over at Coinbase, what it's meant in terms of flows and customers moving over. But soon enough, time will tell."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe British multinational bank Standard Chartered has predicted that Bitcoin will reach a value of $100,000 by the end of 2024. The bank noted that Bitcoin has seen a massive resurgence this year, and the \u2018crypto spring\u2019 has already begun.\n\n\n\nThe prediction is a reiteration of the bank\u2019s forecast in April of this year. The April report noted that the crypto winter is finally over, and several factors that could drive Bicoin\u2019s climb to $100,000 are already at play. One such factor the report highlighted was the turmoil in the banking sector in March this year that helped to \u201cre-establish Bitcoin\u2019s use as a decentralised scarce digital asset.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest statements by the bank, the new catalyst to support the Bitcoin price rise would be the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Standard Chartered team and the head of crypto strategy and emerging markets FX at Standard Chartered, Geoff Kendrick, believe the ETF approvals \u201care likely to come sooner than expected.\u201d \u201cWe think a number of spot ETFs will now be approved in Q1 2024 for both BTC and ETH, paving the way for institutional investment,\u201d they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team also claimed that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 will be another source for the price surge. They believe so because past Bitcoin halving events were almost always followed by a crypto bull run.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin halving is an event where rewards for mining new bitcoins are cut in half roughly every four years. This event is designed to reduce the rate at which new bitcoins are created through mining. With a finite supply of only 21 million coins, Bitcoin halvings help control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s Bitcoin price surge prediction has already been reinforced, with Bitcoin soaring 130 percent in 2023. \u201cPut simply, everything is working as expected,\u201d the bank said. \u201cBTC\u2019s dominance remains intact \u2013 its share of overall digital assets market cap has increased to 50 percent from 45 percent in April.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank also suggested that there is a chance for Bitcoin to climb the $100,000 mark before the end of the year. They said, \u201cWe now expect more price upside to materialise before the halving than we previously did, specifically via the earlier-than-expected introduction of the US spot ETFs. This suggests a risk that the USD 100,000 level could be reached before the end of 2024.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank\u2019s prediction has already been reinforced by Bitcoin\u2019s strong performance this year. Whether the prediction will genuinely be realised can only be seen when the time comes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist.

        "content": "Twitter (now X) co-founder and Bitcoin (BTC) advocate Jack Dorsey is backing a new BTC mining pool to help miners regain control of block rewards and transaction fees.\n\nDorsey has led a $6.2 million seed round for Mummolin, the parent company of the new decentralization Bitcoin mining pool called Ocean, according to an announcement on Nov. 29.\n\nThe seed funding will support the launch of Ocean, which is designed to decentralize and reshape the process of Bitcoin mining. The mining pool specifically aims to provide more mining process transparency and enable miners to receive block rewards directly from Bitcoin rather than from BTC mining pools.\n\nIan Northon, co-founder and chief legal officer at Mummolin, told Cointelegraph that the raised money will be used for general corporate purposes. \u201cOur cap table is private, but we are proud to have several OG Bitcoiners and other Bitcoin thought leaders back the project,\u201d Northon said, adding:\n\n\u201cOur payout system TIDES is an abbreviation for Transparent Index of Distinct Extended Shares, which we believe is an upgrade and improvement on PPLNS and vastly better than FPPS, especially over miner's transaction fee revenue.\u201d\n\nLuke Dashjr, Mummolin co-founder and long-time Bitcoin Core developer, believes that the role of mining pools must change for Bitcoin to exist as a truly decentralized currency.\n\n\u201cOcean is a new type of pool that enables miners to be truly miners again. We are launching as the most transparent pool and also the only noncustodial pool where miners are the recipients of new block rewards directly from Bitcoin,\u201d Dashjr stated.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin user pays $3.1M transaction fee for 139 BTC transfer\n\nMummolin co-founder and president Mark Artymko stressed that traditional BTC mining pools take exclusive custody of block rewards and transaction fees before distributing them among miners. \u201cThis gives them the ability to withhold payment from individual miners, whether by their own choice or by legal requirement,\u201d Artymko said, adding:\n\n\u201cOCEAN\u2019s non-custodial payouts directly to miners from the block reward remove this risk and the pool\u2019s undue influence over miners.\u201d\n\nCommitted Ocean supporter Dorsey is confident that the platform will solve the problem of further centralization of pools and mining pools that could plague Bitcoin. He noted:\n\n\u201cWhen I see a project that is good for Bitcoin broadly, and that\u2019s also good for me and my companies personally, it becomes a simple decision for me and I\u2019m happy to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe launch of Ocean was announced at the Future of Bitcoin Mining Conference in the shadows of Barefoot Mining\u2019s 150-year-old hydroelectric dam in rural South Carolina. Barefoot Mining, the first client of Ocean, has fully repurposed the dam, converting excess energy to Bitcoin mining at scale.\n\nOcean\u2019s launch is 139 days before Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving event, which is expected on April 17, 2024. After the halving, the current 6.25 BTC mining reward per block will drop to 3.125 BTC, significantly decreasing incentives for Bitcoin miners.\n\nMagazine: Real AI use cases in crypto, No. 2: AIs can run DAOs"

As the community celebrates the anniversary of the first Bitcoin halving, it\u2019s timely to revisit some of Bitcoin\u2019s historical milestones ahead of the next halving expected in April 2024.\n\nThe first Bitcoin transaction occurred nearly 15 years ago on Jan. 3, 2009, a few months after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, published the Bitcoin white paper in October 2008.\n\nOn Nov. 28, 2012 \u2014 three years and 10 months after Bitcoin\u2019s first block was mined \u2014 the first-ever halving event took place. At the time, BTC traded at around $12, according to data from StatMuse, or 308,200% below Bitcoin\u2019s current price, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThough Bitcoin\u2019s halving and the digital currency\u2019s 21 million supply cap are not directly described in Nakamoto\u2019s white paper, the document still hints at certain mechanisms to control the creation of new BTC. The white paper reads:\n\n\u201cTo compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they\u2019re generated too fast, the difficulty increases.\u201d\n\nUnlike some basic information in the Bitcoin white paper, the halving aspect is mentioned in the Bitcoin source code. The halving is specifically available on the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository on the validation.cpp file and indicates the miner\u2019s block subsidy is \u201ccut in half every 210,000 blocks, which will occur every four years.\u201d\n\nA Bitcoin halving-related snippet from the Bitcoin Core repository. Source: GitHub\n\nThe Bitcoin halving mechanism had been programmed into the BTC mining algorithm to counteract inflation by maintaining scarcity.\n\nBefore the first halving occurred, miners were compensated with as much as 50 BTC per block. After the first halving event in 2012, the subsidy was slashed to 25 BTC, followed by the second halving in 2016, which reduced the subsidy to 12.5 BTC. The most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in 2020, cutting the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.\n\nAs Bitcoin halvings significantly increase the cryptocurrency\u2019s scarcity, the Bitcoin price cycle has been historically impacted by halvings. Just a year after its first-ever halving, Bitcoin had risen to nearly $1,000, while the second halving triggered a 350% surge during the year after the event, with BTC subsequently rallying to then all-time highs of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.\n\nRelated: Crypto community begins Bitcoin halving countdown as milestone date nears\n\nIn the aftermath of the third Bitcoin halving, BTC surged to its all-time high of almost $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nThe anniversary of the first Bitcoin halving comes as the cryptocurrency community awaits the fourth Bitcoin halving, which is now expected to occur on April 17, 2024. Many Bitcoin advocates are especially bullish on the Bitcoin price in 2024 amid growing expectations that United States securities regulators could finally approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe 2024 halving won\u2019t be the last one, though. Bitcoin miner reward is expected to be halved 34 times until it reaches 0 BTC after all 21 million Bitcoin are mined. Based on the current schedule, the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin will be reached around 2140.\n\nMagazine: 5,050 Bitcoin for $5 in 2009: Helsinki\u2019s claim to crypto fame"

        "content": "Bitcoin's price may be due for one more pullback in the coming weeks and that could be a good opportunity to buy more of the cryptocurrency before its next leg up, according to Wolfe Research. The flagship cryptocurrency has been riding a wave of positive momentum driven primarily by enthusiasm surrounding the prospects for regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. After stagnating around $30,000 for much of the year, bitcoin has steadily climbed to new 2023 highs in recent weeks \u2013 breaking past $38,000 on Friday, after reaching $37,000 just a couple weeks prior. The next stop could be as high as $40,000, according to Wolfe's Rob Ginsberg. \"[Bitcoin] now sits within reach of having retraced 50% of the decline off its highs,\" Ginsberg wrote in a note last week. \"With ETF excitement growing and money continuing to pour into the space, we feel there's plenty of upside left to be had. However \u2026 near term price action may provide for one more buying opportunity before continuing higher.\" BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin (BTC) now has retraced nearly 50% of the decline off its 2021 all-time high. \"As MACD [moving average convergence/divergence] rolls over and overbought conditions come in, all signs point toward a near-term pullback,\" he added. \"We would use it as a buying opportunity as the next move higher likely takes price above $40,000.\" Ginsberg pointed to bitcoin's \"wildly impressive\" year in total, with a year-to-date gain of 120% \u2013 despite months of lethargy in the spring and summer. Although on Tuesday bitcoin was back down to about $37,200, according to Coin Metrics, it has still retraced nearly 50% of its decline from roughly $69,300 in November 2021 to about $15,200 at the end of 2022. Meanwhile, ether is retesting and consolidating at the $2,000 level, which it hit earlier this month for the first time since April and which has proven a ceiling for the second largest crypto coin for more than a year. Ginsberg said ether is \"right on the cusp\" of a breakout. \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States now have a \u201cclear runway\u201d to potential simultaneous approvals after an advanced decision to delay the bids of Franklin Templeton and Hashdex ETFs, according to analysts.\n\nIn a Nov. 28 X (formerly Twitter) post, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on the applications 34 days earlier than the Jan. 1, 2024, decision deadline.\n\nThe SEC requested comments on forms by Franklin Templeton and Hashdex that are necessary for the ETFs to eventually be listed and start trading. The comment and rebuttal period will last 35 days.\n\nSeyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas had placed 90% odds on spot Bitcoin ETF approvals by Jan. 10, 2024, and the twin delays \u201call but confirms for me that this was likely a move to line every applicant up for potential approval by the Jan 10, 2024 deadline,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\nBalchunas agreed, posting to X that the SEC was \u201cprob looking to get them out of the way, clear runway.\u201d\n\nProb looking to get them out of the way, clear runway \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 28, 2023\n\nCommercial litigator Joe Carlasare thinks the delays increase the probability of a March 2024 approval, as the comment period for Franklin\u2019s ETF bid was extended until Jan. 3, 2024, and the SEC typically takes a maximum of three weeks to review comments.\n\nThe Franklin BItcoin spot ETF comment period now extends until January 3rd.\n\n\n\nThe SEC typically reviews comments for at least 2-3 weeks. Therefore, although it\u2019s not guaranteed, this increases the probability of a March approval.\n\n\n\nJanuary is still likely the favorite though. \u2014 Joe Carlasare (@JoeCarlasare) November 28, 2023\n\n\u201cJanuary is still likely the favorite though,\u201d he added, later estimating it to happen on Jan. 5 or Jan. 8.\n\nRelated: Futures will be the best crypto game in town even after a Bitcoin spot ETF\n\nOn Nov. 28, Franklin also submitted an updated Form S-1 for its ETF \u2014 a document registering securities with the SEC \u2014 after Seyffart had earlier highlighted that it was the only bidder yet to submit an updated prospectus.\n\nReacting to the filing, Balchunas said while he\u2019s in favor of letting all ETFs launch simultaneously, it \u201cseems kinda unfair\u201d that Franklin might be allowed to launch its ETF the same day as other providers despite submitting the form months later.\n\nWhile I'm generally in favor in letting them launch at same time, Franklin jumped in sooo late vs others, like 5mo after ARK filed and yet they may be able to launch the same day.. seems kinda unfair... but i suppose SEC can't really draw any lines here \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 28, 2023\n\nThere are currently 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs before the SEC, including bids from Grayscale and BlackRock. Most have final decision dates in March, besides ARK Invest\u2019s bid, which the SEC must approve or deny by Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nMagazine: Beyond crypto \u2014 Zero-knowledge proofs show potential from voting to finance"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCharles Hoskinson of Cardano conducted another AMA livestream.\n\nHoskinson took aim at the SEC for its alleged Bitcoin favoritism.\n\nHe also pushed back on the accusation that ADA had an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently criticized the SEC\u2019s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, accusing the agency of giving Bitcoin a \u201ccomplete pass\u201d while subjecting other crypto assets like Cardano\u2019s ADA token to much harsher scrutiny.\n\nSEC Treatment of ADA a \u201cPathetic Joke\u201d\n\nIn a fiery livestream , Hoskinson called the differential treatment an \u201cabsolutely pathetic joke,\u201d demanding the SEC explain why Bitcoin is viewed as sufficiently decentralized while cryptos like ADA are labeled securities. \u201cExplain it to me [the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies] like I am five years old. Run the Howey test!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you subpoena and attack about three different entities, you could perform a 51% attack on Bitcoin because that\u2019s the way the hash power works,\u201d Hoskinson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s decentralized, apparently.\u201d\n\nThe Cardano founder argued Bitcoin is not as decentralized as commonly believed since controlling over half the network\u2019s hash rate would only require coercion of a few large mining pools.\n\nCharles Hoskinson GOES OFF on SEC & Bitcoin getting a pass while Cardano $ADA & crypto has to suffer. \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/Vm1u9jGrIr \u2014 Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) November 27, 2023\n\nHoskinson also rebutted claims that Cardano had an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) token sale, which could justify stricter regulatory oversight.\n\n\u201cThere was an airdrop onto a distribution, and then thousands of people who never met each other traded Ada on exchanges and used Cardano for their projects,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cA voucher sale of a different asset outside of the United States, priced in Yen, settled in Bitcoin, explained in Japanese to Japanese citizens, and without a single US participant does not constitute an ICO of Ada.\u201d\n\nICOs are controversial in the context of whether or not cryptocurrencies like ADA and Bitcoin are securities. Regulators are more likely to view a cryptocurrency that had an ICO as a security due to their shared characteristics, including the expectation of profit and the fact that an ICO could be construed as an investment contract.\n\nThe debate about which cryptocurrency is a security is a live one for Hoskinson and Cardano. ADA has repeatedly been mentioned as a \u201ccrypto asset security\u201d in SEC documents. Most recently in a case involving the cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken.\n\nCharles Hoskinson Also Praised Javier Milei\n\nIn the end, Hoskinson attributed the SEC\u2019s uneven treatment to pure favoritism, sarcastically praising Bitcoin\u2019s \u201corange pill moonboys\u201d for receiving preferential treatment from regulators.\n\n\u201cIt would be funny if not for the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars of legal fees have been exhausted in this pyrrhic war that\u2019s being fought on the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also predicted the SEC would lose case after case while the industry continued growing before the regulator\u2019s attack finally ended \u2013 without apology or recompense.\n\nHe vowed that the industry would continue fighting unwinnable court battles until the SEC\u2019s overreach was finally reined in.\n\nHoskinson went on to argue that the entire reason cryptocurrencies were created was to \u201creestablish the social contract\u201d in the face of a \u201chorrifically broken\u201d system where regulators like the SEC waste hundreds of millions harassing the industry while remaining \u201cunaccountable\u201d themselves.\n\nThe Cardano founder praised libertarian lawmakers as the only people improving the situation by \u201cunraveling the government\u201d through cryptos that provide an alternative to legacy finance.\n\nHe also had kind words for Argentina\u2019s new anarcho-capitalist President, Javier Milei. \u201cSomebody who says the government is the problem and not the solution to the problem\u2026 I like that guy.\u201d\n\nHoskinson also spoke enthusiastically about bringing Milei into the pro-blockchain movement, seeing the fiery politician as somewhat of a kindred spirit. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get there, and I think Argentina has a chance to lead the world.\u201d"

This would help create a self-sustaining cycle for renewable energy expansion.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has drawn criticism from environmentalists for the vast amounts of electricity required to support its network and mint new units of the cryptocurrency, with recent analysis from the University of Cambridge estimating that it uses roughly the same amount of electricity as Poland.\n\nThe plummeting costs of renewable energy mean bitcoin miners are increasingly turning to solar, wind and hydro sources to power their operations.\n\n\u201cIn its current status, the infrastructure that supports the Bitcoin protocol cannot be sustained, but the beauty of the protocol is that the incentive structure will force miners to adopt the cheapest form of electricity, which in the near future will be renewable energy,\u201d Don Wyper, COO of DigitalMint, told The Independent last year.\n\nThe latest study, titled \u2018From mining to mitigation: how bitcoin can support renewable energy development and climate action\u2019, was published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering."

Pools have become trusted third parties whose permission we have required for activating soft forks and deciding what gets into the blockchain in addition to taking custody of all newly generated coins,\" OCEAN's Global Head of Sales, pseudonymous Bitcoin Mechanic, said. \"By offering transparency and a mechanism for miners to be paid directly by Bitcoin itself, we make the network radically more robust.\"\n\nSolving Bitcoin mining pool centralization\n\nMummolin was co-founded by long-time Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr. The Wyoming-based company is the successor to the Eligius Bitcoin mining pool Dashjr founded \u2014 a popular zero-fee mining pool that operated from 2010-2017.\n\n\"The role of mining pools must change for Bitcoin to exist as a truly decentralized currency,\" Dashjr said in the statement. \"OCEAN is a new type of pool that enables miners to be truly miners again. We are launching as the most transparent pool and also the only non-custodial pool where miners are the recipients of new block rewards directly from Bitcoin.\"\n\n\"OCEAN is solving a problem for Bitcoiners that I think all of us feel \u2014 further centralization of mining pools that could plague Bitcoin, and how that risks a bunch of Bitcoin attributes that we hold dear,\u201d Dorsey added.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"When I see a project that is good for Bitcoin broadly, and that's also good for me and my companies personally, it becomes a simple decision for me and I'm happy to be a part of it,\" Dorsey said.\n\nBarefoot Mining, OCEAN's first customer, said the new pool would bring some badly needed diversity to Bitcoin mining. \"In my opinion, this is the most significant new company announcement in the Bitcoin world over the past few years,\u201d Barefoot Mining CEO Bob Burnett said. \u201cThe new pool will bring new features and some badly needed diversity to the mining world.\"\n\nAntPool and Foundry USA dominance\n\nTwo centralized Bitcoin mining pools, AntPool and Foundry USA, currently dominate hashrate distribution, with an estimated combined market share of over 55% of the total Bitcoin hashrate, according to Blockchain.com.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that these pools are made up of numerous geographically dispersed Bitcoin miners with the flexibility to redirect their mining power to different pools at any time.\n\nOn Monday, Bitcoin mining firm DEMAND launched the first Bitcoin mining pool that operates on Stratum v2 \u2014 another initiative designed to bolster the decentralization of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\n\nOCEAN said it plans to introduce additional Bitcoin mining decentralization improvements in 2024."

        "title": "Crypto Stories: Charlie Shrem tells how he became a Bitcoin millionaire - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Charlie Shrem went from running a small online business to becoming a Bitcoin (BTC) millionaire and making the cover of Forbes magazine. And then he went to prison.\n\nIn the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Stories, Shrem tells the story of how he founded BitInstant, grew it into a multimillion-dollar Bitcoin empire, and then was arrested for his role in it.\n\nShrem\u2019s first business was an e-commerce site that only charged $5 shipping per item. The idea was his cousin\u2019s, but Shrem used his coding skills to create the actual site. The business sold lights, toothbrushes, razors and other assorted items.\n\nIn his free time, Shrem hung out on online message boards. That\u2019s where he found out about Bitcoin. At the time, the only way to buy Bitcoin was to wire transfer large amounts of funds to Mt. Gox, and it took a week for the deposit to clear within the banking system. A customer who wanted to buy smaller amounts or wanted to buy instantly had no way of doing so.\n\nShrem met up with a person in one of these forums named \u201cGareth,\u201d and the two started a business that would allow people to buy or sell Bitcoin instantly. Their company was called BitInstant. To allow for instant purchases, the company deposited money into Mt. Gox and purchased Bitcoin with it. They then sold this Bitcoin off in smaller amounts to various customers.\n\nBut Shrem and his partner ran into a problem. As their transaction volume grew, they needed more and more cash to deposit into Mt. Gox, and their capital was running out quickly, as Shrem explained:\n\n\u201cIt always needed more money because we were growing in transaction size. So, in a way that an ATM needs money to sit in the machine all day, we needed money to sit in the exchanges for a week, [be]cause it would take up to a week to top up again. It was a cycle, so we always needed seven to eight times our transaction volume.\u201d\n\nThe two entrepreneurs met Roger Ver, who helped them with a $100,000 capital injection to continue scaling the business. Ver also suggested the team hire Erik Voorhees. Later, Voorhees and Shrem ran across David Azar at a tech convention, who invested more. Finally, during his honeymoon, Azar met Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss on a beach and convinced them to invest in the company, which provided enough cash to allow the company to overcome its scaling difficulties.\n\nRelated: Erik Voorhees lashes \u2018disgusting\u2019 behavior of Bitcoin maxis\n\nBitInstant grew so fast that it eventually became responsible for 30% of all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Meanwhile, Shrem was struggling in his relationships with his family and the Jewish community he belonged to. Shrem began to feel that his religious community was stifling, especially after he fell in love with a person who was not Jewish. This frustration eventually reached a peak, and Shrem decided to leave the Jewish community.\n\nThen, while attempting to disembark from a plane in New York, Shrem was arrested and charged with money laundering for his role in BitInstant. Authorities claimed that some BitInstant customers had used the Bitcoin they purchased from the company for illicit purposes, including criminal transactions on the Silk Road dark web marketplace.\n\nWhen released on bail, Shrem was placed under house arrest and forced to live with his strict Jewish parents, who believed that his arrest was a punishment from God in response to him leaving the community. \u201cThey thought I deserved what was coming to me,\u201d Shrem said. \u201cThey were excited to see me go to jail because they felt that I hurt them so hard.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all for Part 1 of Charlie Shrem\u2019s crypto story. There is more to come in Part 2.\n\nFollow the full story: The Untold Story of Charlie Shrem."

        "title": "Crypto Turmoil Pushes Bukele Back Toward Traditional Financial Institutions - El Faro",
        "content": "El Faro is a Central American investigative newsroom. Subscribe to our newsletter.\n\n\n\nLast week, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, made the kind of admission that could have spelt ruin for most companies seeking new markets. But not in San Salvador.\n\nCEO Changpeng Zhao pled guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws, stepped down, and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines to the U.S. government stemming from charges including operating an under-the-table crypto exchange in the country.\n\n\u201cThe company caused illegal transactions\u2026 in sanctioned jurisdictions such as Iran, Cuba, Syria, and Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine \u2014 transactions for which Binance profited with significant fees,\u201d said a U.S. Attorney.\n\nIt strains credulity that the Bukele administration could have been unaware of Binance\u2019s legal troubles in August, when it granted them a local license to issue digital assets like bitcoin: The SEC had publicly accused the firm, in a separate investigation, two months earlier.\n\nIn March 2022, Bukele hosted Zhao, according to state media, to explore \u201cjoining the projects being started in Salvadoran territory.\u201d Ambassador to the U.S. Milena Mayorga announced the following June that Binance had hired 50 \u201cexecutives\u201d in the country.\n\nSince its inception, Bukele\u2019s bitcoin project has stoked worries of money laundering, but the administration has not appeared overly troubled. In its haste to roll out the cryptocurrency wallet Chivo, the government removed Know-Your-Client controls, leading to theft of between $12 to $24 million in public funds, per U.S. court documents.\n\nAt the conclusion of Bitcoin Week in November 2021, bitcoin enthusiasts ended the day at El Zonte Beach, the cradle of cryptocurrency in El Salvador. Photo Carlos Barrera\n\nBinance isn\u2019t the first company under scrutiny to receive a license in El Salvador: Bitfinex, the popular company behind the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin Tether, announced its own license in April. The company was barred from New York State in 2021 for allegedly deceiving users about the volume of reserve dollars backing its Tether tokens.\n\nThe same day that Binance pled guilty, Bitfinex announced it had granted access to its Tether platform to the U.S. Secret Service and plans to do the same with the FBI, in a show of its \u201cunwavering commitment to combat illicit activities.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, smaller players are emerging in the Salvadoran ecosystem. According to Forbes Centroam\u00e9rica, at least seven companies have registered to operate exchanges under the Digital Assets Issuance Law approved in January by the Salvadoran legislature.\n\nEvicted from Bitcoin Beach\n\nFrom the beginning, regulation of the crypto-space in El Salvador has been marred by conflict of interest: Bitfinex was one of the companies who helped write the digital securities law that authorities have used to issue its license.\n\n\u201cThe way bitcoin was implemented posed risks of converting the country into a fiscal paradise and facilitating money laundering,\u201d Lourdes Molina, of the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (ICEFI), told El Faro English. \u201cThose risks are still present.\u201d\n\nGiancarlo Devasini (back right), who opened Bitfinex Securities El Salvador SA de CV in February, appears behind ruling party deputies and Samson Mow (far left) on Feb. 8, 2022. Photo posted to social media by ruling party legislator William Soriano.\n\nThe IMF has been highly critical of the bitcoin implementation, which remains a primary obstacle in granting a debt restructuring agreement with the Salvadoran government.\n\nThe bitcoin experiment also faces low popularity and usage in El Salvador. The government declared related state spending a secret, and the Treasury Ministry claims to not know the amount invested in buying bitcoin, but estimates reach at least $121 million.\n\nAt the same time, key promises made to the public have not come to fruition, like financial inclusion, a rise in employment, or attraction of foreign investment, according to Molina.\n\n\u201cThe adoption of bitcoin was clearly not a public policy designed to improve the wellbeing of the population,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we add to this the legal problems facing these digital assets businesses with licenses to operate here, the question becomes even more relevant: Why does the Bukele administration insist on keeping this project?\u201d\n\nPlans have also disappeared for the much-hyped \u2018volcano\u2019 or \u2018bitcoin bonds\u2019 to be issued by the government \u2014 and originally thought to be brokered by Bitfinex.\n\nBut the government continues to present bitcoin as key to its brand and model of modernization. According to Mala Yerba, 25 families are set to be evicted from the El Zonte beachfront, in order to make room for Bitcoin Beach Club de Playa, a tourism project. Reneging on an original pledge, the government is looking to relocate the decadeslong residents to near a sewage treatment plant.\n\nBitcoin regulation?\n\nThe Salvadoran digital environment remains a chief concern of U.S. policymakers. As the Biden administration finds less and less to say about Bukele\u2019s unconstitutional bid for reelection and repeated reports of mass human rights violations under the 20 months-long state of exception, both governments made a joint statement on November 10 on \u201cshared digital policy priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States and El Salvador seek to collaborate to realize El Salvador\u2019s aspirations to become a regional technology hub through pursuing a sound digital regulatory environment,\u201d wrote the U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce Marisa Lago and Salvadoran Economy Minister Mar\u00eda Luisa Hayem.\n\n\u201cIt is very evident that there has been a rapprochement between El Salvador and the United States, particularly in the economic realm,\u201d said Molina.\n\nChivo, a publicly funded private business, began installing bitcoin ATMs in El Salvador in August 2021. The government dispatched the military and police throughout the country to stand guard over the new machines, like this one in the municipal market in Santa Tecla, La Libertad. Photo V\u00edctor Pe\u00f1a\n\n\u201cWashington looks at El Salvador as a piece of its regional agenda for two main reasons: immigration and the construction of a digital wall against the influence of China and Russia,\u201d concludes Ricardo Valencia, professor at California State, Fullerton, in an op-ed for El Faro English.\n\nTelecoms appear to be a growing front of great power conflict in Central America. This month, Nicaragua granted rights to operate 5G to the US-sanctioned Chinese company Huawei. Costa Rica recently drew the ire of the Chinese Embassy in excluding Huawei from competing for a telecoms project worth over $1.5 billion.\n\nIn her joint statement with El Salvador, Undersecretary Lago also highlighted \u201cbilateral cybersecurity cooperation\u201d and strengthening of the \u201csecurity and resilience of our telecommunications networks,\u201d expressly mentioning 6G technology.\n\nValencia argues the Bukele administration sees in Washington a means to reset its fraught debt relief negotiations with the IMF: \u201cThe president\u2019s openness to regulate the Salvadoran digital environment \u2014this seemed profane in his crypto creed\u2014 appears to indicate he will seek a more conventional path to pay the growing foreign debt.\u201d\n\nThe Fund\u2019s former Latin America director, Alejandro Werner, hired by the Bukele administration in April to \u201ccollaborate\u201d by spurring talks with the IMF, admitted last week in an interview that El Salvador is, together with Argentina and Ecuador, one of the few countries in Latin America that does not have under control its debt problem.\n\nWhile the Bukele administration has received significant financial support from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, the election of Costa Rican Guisela S\u00e1nchez to head the bank could more sternly condition access to finance for San Salvador. And with the crypto-bond path apparently shuttered, the IMF route is now back to center stage.\n\nSources in Washington confirm that Bukele\u2019s new finance minister, Jerson Posada, visited D.C. in September. Kamala Harris\u2019 top security advisor, Phil Gordon, will be in San Salvador today. The new Salvadoran honeymoon with the U.S. government makes an IMF agreement very likely.\n\n\n\n*Correction on Nov. 28 at 12:05 ET: An earlier version of this article misstated that Binance and Zhao pled guilty to 13 charges in a U.S. federal court. While they pled guilty to charges filed by the DOJ, \u201c13\u201d referenced the number of charges presented by the SEC in a separate complaint, which is still ongoing."

        "content": "Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.\n\nHigher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors.\n\nAccording to crypto analyst Adrian Zdu\u0144czyk, Bitcoin\u2019s breakout target is the range between $39,000 and $40,000. The analyst has identified the range between $25,000 and $32,000, as the trading range for Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin price performance has flattened over the past two weeks after the BTC run up to $38,400 on November 24.

        "title": "Futures will be the best crypto game in town even after a Bitcoin spot ETF - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has long been the home of crypto for traditional finance investors, and this is unlikely to change \u2014 even with the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nActivity on the CME has expanded significantly over the past 12 months. The CME now sees more Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading than the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange, Binance. Open BTC interest on the CME now makes up 24.7% of the entire market, making it the top Bitcoin futures trading venue in the world\n\nWhile some of this activity is almost certainly linked to anticipation of approval for a spot ETF, the launch of one or more will not lead to a reduction of activity in the futures market. In fact, futures trading is likely to expand rather than contract when the SEC finally gives BlackRock et. al. the green light.\n\nRelated: History tells us we\u2019re in for a strong bull market with a hard landing\n\nThere is no doubt that a spot ETF will bring large flows of institutional money into the sector. However, it will not change the basic fundamentals of Bitcoin liquidity. As we know, the supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. That means the futures market is the only place where real trade action can happen.\n\nThe CME has been successfully used by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and others to trade cryptocurrency instruments for years, and they have been using futures to do so. Futures remain the instrument of choice because liquidity is the main issue in the spot market. These huge institutional investors could buy bitcoin at any time, but liquidity remains the chief drawback - not the lack of a spot ETF.\n\nBitcoin options open interest, June 2020-November 2023. Source: CoinGlass\n\nInstitutional investors that use the CME are also highly sophisticated. As such, any fund manager that takes a position in BlackRock\u2019s spot ETF, for example, will want to hedge that position using futures on the CME. Accordingly, we can expect activity on the CME to grow almost in lockstep with the growth in spot ETFs.\n\nFutures are also \u2014 as we know \u2014 a speculative instrument, and there is perhaps no market that is more speculative than cryptocurrency. As the asset class gains more legitimacy and credibility with the approval of a spot ETF, we will see more investors interested in all corners of digital asset trading.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: A $600B tipping point for crypto\n\nAdventurous day traders who may have stuck to the foreign-exchange market in the past will likely start to venture into Bitcoin and other crypto instruments. And they will exercise this interest through the CME. Indeed, I suspect we will see increasing interest in perpetual swaps and other types of derivative instruments in the sector next year.\n\nCrypto futures also benefit from clearer and more consistent regulation, which is another major factor here. While the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) looks after futures, nobody has yet fully decided who looks after the crypto spot market from a regulatory perspective, and this remains a problem. Applications for these Bitcoin spot ETFs are currently sitting on the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s desk, but as has become abundantly clear, Chairman Gary Gensler is a big fan of ambiguity.\n\nClear regulation is leading to obvious success in cryptocurrency futures, while the spot market is being hindered by regulatory opacity. And so, while the approval of an ETF is just a matter of time at this stage, we still don\u2019t know how much time. While we are waiting, the futures market remains an extremely enticing trading ground for institutional investors.\n\nLucas Kiely is the chief investment officer for Yield App, where he oversees investment portfolio allocations and leads the expansion of a diversified investment product range.

        "title": "Bitcoin NFT marketplace Bioniq eyes lofty goal of alleviating network congestion - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A new Bitcoin nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace aims to reduce network fees associated with the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions by tapping into the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).\n\nDeveloped off the back of the creation of Bitcoin Ordinals in early 2023, Bioniq operates on the ICP and taps into its native Bitcoin integration to power the trade of Bitcoin-based Ordinals inscriptions.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph on the eve of the platform\u2019s launch, Bioniq CEO and co-founder Bob Bodily said the project has been in development since February 2023. The team has built a marketplace featuring Ordinals smart contracts auctions on the ICP, a complete cross-chain wallet between Bitcoin and the ICP, as well as an inscription tool.\n\n\u201cIt had only been two weeks after Casey Rodarmor released Ord 0.4.0, and I knew Ordinals were going to be absolutely massive.\u201d\n\nThe Bioniq team highlighted the growth in the market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens since their inception in Jan. 2023. The market cap now exceeds $3 billion, with over 42.6 million Ordinals minted to date. This has directly affected Bitcoin network congestion, leading to a spike in Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees last seen since 2021.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees showed significant spikes in 2023 following the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nBioniq\u2019s platform features a smart wallet for users to manage private keys using Web3Auth. This allows users to log into the platform using conventional Web2 Google accounts while maintaining noncustodial control of their wallets and assets.\n\nThe platform also uses partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) through the ICP\u2019s Bitcoin network integration. This unlocks smart contract capabilities for Bitcoin, removing the need for users to use centralized cross-chain bridges.\n\nICP is a \u201cfantastic Bitcoin sidechain\u201d\n\nBuilding on ICP also allows Bioniq to claim transaction finality times below two seconds, as well as zero gas or network fees. Its architecture provides optimized storage costs, averaging around $5 per gigabyte of data stored annually.\n\nBodily added that Toniq, the studio behind Bioniq, has been developing on the ICP since May 2021 and has extensive experience building smart contract wallets, marketplaces, NFT launchpads and collateralized NFT lending protocols:\n\n\u201cICP is a fantastic Bitcoin sidechain right now because it has wonderful Bitcoin primitives at the protocol layer.\u201d\n\nBodily explains that ICP operates a Bitcoin light node running fully on-chain, which facilitates reading the Bitcoin blockchain via native smart contract calls. The ICP also has a threshold digital signature algorithm, known as an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. The implementation allows ICP smart contracts to sign layer-1 Bitcoin transactions and broadcast them to the mempool.\n\n\u201cThese protocol primitives also enabled us to build an Ordinals wrapper entirely at the application layer; we didn\u2019t have to touch the consensus layer of the protocol at all. So it is very fast to build Bitcoin tech on ICP right now,\u201d Bodily added.\n\nBitcoin users and trust assumptions\n\nCointelegraph also inquired whether Bioniq\u2019s wrapping process could be a potential barrier to entry for users. Bodily admits that while the process is largely automated by the Bioniq wallet and only requires BTC, there are two considerations that are pertinent for more discerning users.\n\n\u201cWrapping requires a Bitcoin transaction. This means you have to pay in order to wrap. This is a significant barrier. One way we are addressing the problem is by integrating open Nostr PSBT listings into Bioniq,\u201d Bodily explained.\n\nThis integration means that PSBT listings stored on Nostr through decentralized Ordinals marketplaces OpenOrdex or Deezy Place will be accessible on Bioniq. He added that it removes the need to wrap Bitcoin transactions, as users could list directly on Bioniq using open PSBTs.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Bodily explained that the wrapping process requires \u201ctrust assumptions\u201d on both protocols:\n\n\u201cWrapping over to ICP means in addition to trusting Bitcoin, you are now trusting the Internet Computer Protocol. Some Bitcoin users won\u2019t want the counterparty risk of bridging assets to another chain.\u201d\n\nBodily adds that Bioniq is focusing on developing user experience ahead of inheriting Bitcoin\u2019s security, which is ensured by the finality of layer-1 transactions. However, he envisions a \u201cnice decentralization path\u201d for applications like Bioniq.\n\nThis would involve the evolution from being built on a sidechain with additional trust assumptions to \u201cbecoming a Bitcoin sovereign rollup on ICP that is trust minimized.\u201d The final step would see Bioniq becoming a Bitcoin zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) on the ICP with no additional trust assumptions, inheriting the full security and decentralization of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cICP fits perfectly into this plan as well because ICP can provide a replicated execution environment (decentralized sequencer) or validium (extra off-Bitcoin storage for rollups).\u201d\n\nBanking on Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition\n\nA number of NFT marketplaces already offer Bitcoin Ordinals auctions and trading, which begs the question of what an exclusively Ordinals platform will bring to the ecosystem.\n\nBodily believes that existing offerings that featured \u201csofter pivots\u201d to Ordinals on their platforms were hamstrung by confusing user experiences. Developing a \u201cdedicated Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace, built for Bitcoin users natively\u201d hinges on developing a native cross-chain, BTC-ICP wallet.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin\u2019s unchallenged position as the preeminent and largest cryptocurrency by market cap remains another drawcard for the continued interest in Bitcoin NFTs into the future.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the numbers, 89% of people in the world have heard about Bitcoin, Bitcoin accounts for around 50% of the total crypto market cap, and Ordinals have done over $500 million in volume this year \u2014 so there is massive demand.\u201d\n\nBioniq joins the likes of Ordinals Market as a Bitcoin-only Ordinals marketplace. Gamma is another Ordinals marketplace that directly mints to Bitcoin\u2019s layer-1 chain. Ordswap was an early Ordinals marketplace that has since closed down after losing control of its website to hackers. Meanwhile, multichain platforms like Magic Eden prominently list Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapping a two-day losing streak, major cryptocurrencies traded higher on Wednesday, led by gains in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap surged 2.2% to around $1.43 trillion in the last 24 hours.At 11.56 a.m., BTC was trading 2.85% higher at $38,031, while the second most popular token, Ethereum, was up 2.4% at $2,051. Solana also surged over 7% to $58.32.Positive sentiments prevailed in the market as Bitcoin breached the $37,800 threshold. This price movement could reflect that market participants have now absorbed the news about the recent leadership change at Binance, restoring bullish confidence in their investments, said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex.Other popular altcoins, such as Dogecoin , Chainlink, and Avalanche, surged 4-5%. Also, BNB XRP , Cardano, Tron, Polygon, Litecoin , and Shiba Inu rose 2-3%.The total volume in DeFi is currently $4.74 billion, 9.19% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $46.95 billion, which is 90.96% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, fell to $743 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 51.99%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours surged 18.3% to $22.4 billion.Bitcoin, in the last 24 hours, has showcased a bullish momentum again and went on to surpass the $38k psychological resistance. While the path to $41k may not have a lot of resistance now, traders may begin to undergo bearish sentiments. However, from a historical lens, the last bull run also started during November-December after showing a negligible pullback for 6 months in a row, said CoinSwitch Markets Desk.The 4-hour chart reflects a delicate balance between bullish and bearish sentiment, with the $36,950 pivot point that Bitcoin has tentatively breached, indicating a potential market move.Immediate resistance levels lie at $37,986, $38,429 and the more ambitious $39,066, while support is at $36,399 and $35,722. The chart shows an ascending channel formation, indicating a steady uptrend along the lower support trendline. Given the RSI and EMA, there is cautious optimism for continued upward momentum.Overall, the trend is bullish and short-term forecasts call for a resistance test at $37,986. Holding support above the pivot and 50 EMA could pave the way for a challenge of higher resistance zones, especially the $38,000 level, which will attract further buying interest towards $39,000.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

This represents over a year of dedicated research and development by the team, with a focus on enhancing user experience.\n\n\"We want to make it as easy as possible to start building on Bitcoin,\" said Willem Schroe, the Founder and CEO of Botanix. The initiative stems from the team's ambition to propel Bitcoin beyond its status as the pinnacle of digital currency and position it as the cornerstone of a novel decentralized financial ecosystem.\n\nAt the core of this initiative is Spiderchain, a decentralized network of multisigs empowering anyone to operate a full Botanix node and participate in the network. Introducing forward security, a concept derived from encryption systems, Spiderchain facilitates low-cost, swift transactions for Bitcoin deployments.\n\nThe innovative aspect of Botanix's Spiderchain is its seamless compatibility with Ethereum's EVM smart contracts. This compatibility enables developers to effortlessly replicate and deploy any EVM smart contract onto the Botanix testnet using Bitcoin.\n\nCasa's co-founder & CTO Jameson Lopp, in his analysis of the Spiderchain's whitepaper, highlighted its implementation on Bitcoin without necessitating any protocol alterations at the base layer. \u201cWhile there are a variety of proposals being discussed for enhancing Bitcoin's Layer 2 capabilities\u2026one distinction with spiderchains is that they can be implemented on Bitcoin today without any protocol changes to the base layer,\u201d he said.\n\nBotanix Labs is now forging ahead to incubate the first-ever Bitcoin-enabled DeFi and NFT ecosystem. The testnet encompasses a Signet Bitcoin faucet, a bridge, and AvocadoSwap, akin to PancakeSwap, facilitating token swaps.\n\nMoreover, Botanix is launching the \"Botanix Testnet Accelerator,\" inviting 10 startups for enhanced BD support, co-marketing, and development resources ahead of the mainnet launch slated for early next year. Selection criteria encompass the product's development, transaction activity, and business potential.\n\nThe Botanix testnet is available for trial, inviting feedback from users at here.\n\nDisclaimer: UTXO Management is an investor in Botanix.

That's a 3.5% 24-hour rise. Over seven days, it's up nearly 3%.\n\nBitcoin last week blew past $38,000 per coin for the first time in 18 months. Before then, the cryptocurrency had generally traded below the $38,000 level ever since crypto mega project Terra collapsed in May 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, a combination of optimism surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and comments today from Federal Reserve governor Christopher J. Waller are leading to bullish price action.\n\nOn Tuesday, Waller said that while \"inflation is still too high,\" he was \"increasingly confident that policy is currently well positioned to slow the economy and get inflation back to 2 percent.\"\n\nThis is having a positive impact on Bitcoin as investors feel more confident to put their money into an asset which has typically struggled\u2014along with other \"risk assets\"\u2014with high interest rates.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at the European digital asset manager CoinShares, told Decrypt that \"it appears that Waller's remarks have favorably influenced Bitcoin prices,\" adding that it indicate \"a shift from the possibility of rate hikes, which were under consideration just two months ago.\"\n\nBitcoin and the crypto market was hit hard after Terra collapsed last May. The blockchain project collapsed when its algorithmic stablecoin stopped working, which in turn led to widespread crypto contagion: a fall in the price of every coin and token and the bankruptcy of major digital asset companies that had exposure to the failed crypto venture.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut investors now appear to be feeling confident in investing in the digital asset industry\u2014at least with Bitcoin. Most cash entering the space is focused on the biggest and oldest virtual coin and is coming from institutional investors, a CoinShares report yesterday showed.\n\nSuch investors are confident that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will finally approve a Bitcoin ETF after a decade of waiting. Such a product would give traditional investors exposure to crypto and, according to some experts, lead to a flood of capital into the space."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCharlie Munger, longtime business partner of Warren Buffett and vice chairman of multinational holding company Berkshire Hathaway, has died at the age of 99, the company announced today. Munger's proclamations, much like Buffett's, were often eminently quotable takedowns of bad investments\u2014and few assets raised his ire like Bitcoin.\n\n\"I think it's rat poison,\" he famously said in 2013, when Bitcoin was worth $150. When asked to revisit his comments five years later, when the world's largest cryptocurrency was trading at $9,000, he said, \"So it's more expensive rat poison.\"\n\nWhen pressed on the returns some Bitcoin investors were able to make, he called them \"idiot booms\" that harm the U.S.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBerkshire Hathaway annual meetings were often called \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" and putting Munger and Buffett on stage was a top draw. Asking about cryptocurrency was a reliable way to get them to use colorful language.\n\n\"In my life, I try and avoid things that are stupid, and evil, and maybe look bad in comparison with somebody else,\" he said in 2018. \"Bitcoin does all three.\"\n\n\"It's stupid because it's very likely to go to zero; it's evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve system... and third, it makes us look foolish compared to the communist leader in China,\" he explained. \"[Xi Jinping] was smart enough to ban Bitcoin in China... we are a lot dumber.\"\n\nThree years later, and Munger was still fuming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I just think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization,\" he said in early 2022, comparing crypto to a venereal disease, deeming it \"beneath contempt.\"\n\nEven at 99 years old, he mustered more fiery condemnation at the Daily Journal Corporation annual meeting earlier this year.\n\n\"Sometimes I call it crypto crapple and sometimes I call it, well, crypto shit,\" he said, going on to use the term half a dozen times during the course of the conversation. \"It's ridiculous that anybody would buy this stuff.\"\n\n\"It's asinine, it's not slightly stupid it's massively stupid, and it's very dangerous,\" he continued. \"The governments were totally wrong to permit it. I'm not proud of my country for allowing this crypto shit, it's worthless, it's no good, it's crazy, it'll do nothing but harm.\"\n\nWhile Munger's attacks ruffled cryptocurrency backers, his candor was long part of Berkshire's folksy public image. He worked alongside Buffett for decades, offering investment wisdom almost as quotable as the \"Oracle of Omaha\" himself.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway said Munger died peacefully in a California hospital. Buffett paid tribute to Munger's \"inspiration, wisdom and participation\" in building Berkshire into the conglomerate it is today."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that it wants fresh feedback from the public on whether it should approve or disapprove a spot bitcoin ETF solicited by asset manager Franklin Templeton, just weeks after first delaying a decision on the proposed fund. The move prompted some analysts to note that the regulator appeared to be moving quickly.\n\nThe SEC said it wants more analysis and is \"instituting proceedings\" to do so. The regulator asked commenters on Tuesday about concerns regarding manipulation and fraud, as well as the fund's relationship to Coinbase, which would be the custodian if the ETF garners approval.\n\n\"The Commission is providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration,\" it wrote, saying it wanted to analyze whether the application is consistent with the requirement that \"the rules of a national securities exchange be 'designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices' and 'to protect investors and the public interest,'\" the agency said in the filing.\n\n\"Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as described below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change,\" it continued.\n\nThe asset manager first filed for the Franklin Bitcoin BTC -3.23% ETF in September, and, if approved, would have shares listed and traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Multiple applications for spot bitcoin ETFs have been filed from other asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nHashdex application\n\nThe regulator also said it would institute proceedings and solicit public feedback on an application for the Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF application, which proposed converting its exchange-traded fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange into a partial spot product.\n\nComments on both funds are due in 21 days, with a rebuttal period continuing for two weeks after that. The SEC has yet to approve a spot bitcoin fund and has so far delayed all applications it's received for the product.\n\nSpeculation swirls\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nSome analysts noted on X that the SEC seemed to be moving quickly with the latest action on the Franklin Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\n\"Wow. SEC went super early on Franklin. They weren't due for another decision until Jan 1,\" James Seyffart, an ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote on X. \"Going super early on Franklin today (and potentially @hashdex coming too?) would set things up for a full wave of approvals in early January. Might be the reasoning?\"\n\nVan Buren Capital's Scott Johnsson said the move could be an effort to get all the spot bitcoin ETFs on the same timeline.\n\n\"They might have chosen to do this early so they could have the comment period end before Jan 10, in order to approve everyone at the same time,\" Johnsson posted on X.\n\nFresh Franklin Templeton filing\n\nFranklin Templeton followed the SEC action on Tuesday by filing an amended S-1 form.\n\n\"Notably, the language in this S-1 mimics a lot of others on the creation/redemption process. Leaves open the possibility for both In-kind and/or Cash,\" Seyffart wrote.\n\n(Updates with filing on Hashdex fund, fresh filing from Franklin Templeton.)"

        "content": "Charles Hoskinson criticized the SEC for giving Bitcoin a \u201cfree pass\u201d while other crypto assets are treated as securities.\n\nThe Cardano founder noted that BTC is not decentralized, as it would take merely three subpoenas to perform a 51% attack on the network.\n\nUpon being highlighted that the ADA\u2019s ICO is the reason Cardano is treated as a security, Hoskinson stated that it did not have an ICO.\n\nCardano is known as the third-generation cryptocurrency and, at times, even the \"Ethereum killer\" but never as \u201cnot a security\u201d. For that matter, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to date, has only named Bitcoin as \"not a security,\" and XRP partially won that label following its lawsuit win. This seemingly did not sit well with Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson.\n\nCharles Hoskinson criticizes the SEC\n\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson, during a recent stream, took on the SEC for giving Bitcoin essentially a free pass by not scrutinizing it as security the same way it does with other crypto assets. Hoskinson stated,\n\n\"Explain it to me [the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies] like I am a five years old. Run the Howey test.\n\nHe went on to add that Bitcoin is not as decentralized as the SEC believes it to be. The reason is that over 51% of the hash rate can be controlled merely by subpoenaing the top three hash pools.\n\nIn response, crypto influencer Adam Black stated that the reason behind Bitcoin not being secure is that it did not do an ICO (Initial Coin Offering). He added,\n\n\"Bitcoin did not do an ICO, most people thought it had no value, it was mined from zero, it is decentralised, there is no CEO, ICO warchested \"foundation\", incorporation etc. so cardano, eth etc clearly pas howey, Bitcoin is a commodity and does not.\n\nICOs are a form of crowdfunding where cryptocurrencies are sold to investors in the form of tokens. The ICO boom of 2018 was one of the biggest driving factors of the bull run noted back then.\n\nHoskinson replied to Adam's statement by saying that Cardano did not do an ICO. He noted,\n\n\"There was an airdrop onto a distribution, and then thousands of people who never met each other traded Ada on exchanges and used Cardano for their projects. A voucher sale of a different asset outside of the United States, priced in Yen, settled in Bitcoin, explained in Japanese to Japanese citizens, and without a single US participant does not constitute an ICO of Ada.\n\nTechnically, Cardano did conduct an ICO by utilizing a novel variation. As stated on Cardano's official website discussing the genesis of the chain, the ADA vouchers were sold by a Japanese corporation and its sales force in Japan with total gross sales of 108,844.5 BTC. The public sales distribution accounts for 25,927,070,538 ADA, of which 2.4 billion were distributed to IOHK, the developer of Cardano.\n\nThus, as long as the United States does not establish clear guidelines and regulations for the crypto industry, Charles Hoskinson and others will continue to criticize the SEC for its seemingly partial approach toward crypto assets."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe Ordinals protocol\u2014which enables the inscription of NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014commanded the attention of the crypto world at the start of the year, and the space has continued to grow and evolve since. And here\u2019s a new twist: The latest Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace isn\u2019t even built on Bitcoin.\n\nBioniq, which is backed by Polychain Capital and officially opens Wednesday, is instead built on Internet Computer (ICP), the layer-1 blockchain developed by Dfinity that offers integrations with Bitcoin. In this case, Bioniq treats Internet Computer like a layer-2 scaling network of sorts, claiming that it offers various benefits over other Ordinals marketplaces.\n\nIt\u2019s billed as the \u201cworld\u2019s fastest\u201d Ordinals marketplace, offers a built-in wallet with optional Google login via Web3Auth, and doesn\u2019t charge network transaction or gas fees to traders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt works via a token wrapping process on Internet Computer. Bitcoiners who want to use Bioniq can transfer their Bitcoin and Ordinals assets into the marketplace\u2019s wallet. They can then choose to wrap the Ordinals asset by sending it to a specified Bitcoin wallet address for safekeeping, and then an identical NFT is generated on the Internet Computer network.\n\nFrom there, assets can be traded on the speedier ICP network without gas or transaction fees. While there are extra steps involved to do so, Bioniq believes that this process is ultimately preferable to what most Ordinals marketplaces do, which is utilize partially signed Bitcoin transactions\u201d (PSBTs) to handle transactions on the slower Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cEven in high Bitcoin fee environments, everything that is wrapped can be transacted at the speed and cost of ICP rather than the speed and cost of Bitcoin, giving users a more reliable (faster and smoother) experience regardless of the fee spikes on Bitcoin,\u201d Bioniq CEO and co-founder Bob Bodily told Decrypt.\n\nBioniq also offers functionality that it claims other Ordinals marketplaces lack, such as allowing for \u201ceasily adjustable\u201d offers and enabling English auctions with a set reserve price.\n\nBodily and team also have big plans ahead for the marketplace, with ambitions to build a launchpad for newly minted collections, add a way for users to borrow crypto with their Ordinals assets held as collateral, and enable collection offers made with the intent of buying any asset in a particular desired project.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

The blockchain research and engineering firm behind Cardano, Input Output Global (IOG) has refuted the SEC\u2019s claims, arguing that its complaints against Binance and Coinbase contain \u201cnumerous factual inaccuracies,\u201d and that \u201cunder no circumstances is ADA a security under U.S. securities laws.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUndeterred, the SEC has repeated its claim that Cardano is a security, most recently in a new round of charges filed against crypto exchange Kraken.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, consumes not only a huge amount of electricity but also a lot of water, according to a new study. The study, published in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability, estimates that Bitcoin mining uses over 1,600 gigaliters (GL) of water per year globally, enough to fill 640,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This water is used primarily to cool down the computers that run the complex calculations to generate new Bitcoins."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for degens to dance on the grave of longtime crypto hater and Warren Buffett consigliere Charlie Munger, who died yesterday at the age of 99.\n\nIn fact, It took less than 15 minutes after Berkshire Hathaway announced its vice chairman\u2019s passing for a Munger memecoin (MUNGER) to debut on decentralized exchange Uniswap. Those intrepid degen reflexes appear to have paid off: The Ethereum-based token is up 409% in the last 24 hours, according to GeckoTerminal. Shortly after its launch, the token was up over 31,500%.\n\n\n\nTo be clear, MUNGER is still six decimal spots shy of being worth more than a penny\u2014it\u2019s sitting at just $0.00000001884 as of this writing. It\u2019s also highly volatile, and is already down 34% in the last hour. But that hasn\u2019t stopped irony-poisoned meme coin traders from pumping the token with $3.57 million in trading volume since yesterday. The coin currently sits at a market capitalization just north of $132,000\u2014though that figure, too, is already falling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow would the late Munger take the news that his passing lined the pockets of at least a few \u201cshitcoin\u201d aficionados? Probably not very kindly.\n\nCharlie Munger meme coin up 31,500% in the last hour God would he hate this pic.twitter.com/9sU5BCSZB2 \u2014 Michael McQuaid (@michaelgmcquaid) November 28, 2023\n\n\"I'm not proud of my country for allowing this crypto shit,\" Munger said earlier this year. \"It's worthless, it's no good.\"\n\nThe year prior Munger compared crypto to a venereal disease, skewering the entire industry as \"beneath contempt.\"\n\n\"I just think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization,\" he said at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even to get into Bitcoin specifically, which he routinely referred to as \u201crat poison.\u201d\n\nMeme coins have a rich and storied history of capitalizing on breaking news to pump highly speculative tokens of questionable origin. Just last week, a freshly-minted CZ token, created in the immediate aftermath of Changpeng Zhao\u2019s shocking resignation as Binance\u2019s CEO, pumped 18,000%.\n\nThat price movement comes with a hefty price tag, however: Meme coins like MUNGER are routinely \u201crug-pulled\u201d by their anonymous creators, who withdraw liquidity and leave investors holding the bag.\n\nSuch moves could be condemned as \u201cmassively stupid,\u201d \u201cevil,\u201d \u201cno good,\u201d or \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d But that\u2019s nothing Munger hasn\u2019t said already.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "November 29, 2023 09:14 pm | Updated 09:14 pm IST - Bengaluru\n\nThe Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) probing the bitcoin scam has issued a notice to the Prison and Correctional Services Department seeking multiple details.\n\nAccording to sources, in a letter sent to the department, the SIT has sought details about hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki\u2019s stay in the Bengaluru Central Prison. The notice was sent by the head of the SIT, Additional Director-General of Police (ADGP) Manish Karbikar.\n\nSriki was arrested in 2020 in a drug case after he was suspected of being involved in purchasing narcotic substances through the Dark Net. Later, in the course of the investigation, it was found that he had allegedly hacked Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency trading website, and government websites. In a volunteer statement given to the police, Sriki admitted to hacking. He was in prison between 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn the notice issued to the Director-General (DG), Prisons, the SIT, according to sources, has sought details about the timeline of Sriki\u2019s stay in the prison and in which cell he was kept. The SIT has also asked the department to share details of visitors who met him while he was in the prison at Parappana Agrahara.\n\nThe source said that through the notice, the investigation team wants to know the names or details of the prison officers who were on duty during Sriki\u2019s stay. The team has also sought details about Sriki\u2019s movement between the court and the prison when he was under judicial custody. The source said initially it was suspected that three senior officers and a constable may have been involved in the scam and instrumental in making Sriki move bitcoins from inside the quarantine cell. \u201cBut now it is suspected that more officials may be involved in the scandal,\u201d the source added.\n\nWhen contacted, Mr. Karbikar said this was part of the investigation and refused to comment further."
