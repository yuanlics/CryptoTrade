        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -2.25% 's price could surpass $40,000 this year after Binance\u2019s DOJ settlement and former CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s guilty plea to financial violations signaled a turning point in the crypto landscape, according to Matrixport analyst Markus Thielen.\n\nBinance's agreement to pay $4.3 billion in fines marks one of the largest corporate settlements in U.S. history. After stepping down as CEO, Zhao will pay a $50 million fine and a $175 million personal recognizance bond. He also faces a possible 18-month prison sentence, with a hearing set for Feb. 23.\n\nThe outcome, less severe than a feared $10 billion fine and not accusing Binance of misappropriating user funds or alleging market manipulation, suggests it will likely remain a top-three exchange over the next 2 to 3 years, the analyst argued.\n\nDespite the Binance news initially being perceived as a risk-off event, bitcoin only experienced a temporary correction, Thielen said, bouncing back from the $36,000 level in a \"robust counter-trend reaction.\u201d with \u201cbitcoin surging above $40,000 inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe anticipate bitcoin surpassing $38,000 by the end of this month with an 80% probability, followed by a rally above $40,000 in December with 90% probability,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nBitcoin seasonality\n\nOctober 2023 saw bitcoin's price soar by 28%, a trend that may continue with the anticipated approval of a bitcoin spot ETF in the U.S., the Matrixport analyst said, something that would further underscore confidence in bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.\n\nSeasonality is another factor, with average December returns of 12% potentially lifting bitcoin to $42,000 by this metric alone, he added.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nTether\u2019s USDT market capitalization increases by $5 billion\n\nSince September, Tether\u2019s USDT market capitalization has increased by $5 billion, signaling a growing trend among institutional investors shifting from fiat into stablecoins, potentially converting them into other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, Thielen said.\n\n\u201cLast night, another $600 million USDT appeared to be minted, potentially signaling inflows into bitcoin after the Binance/CZ deal with U.S. enforcement authorities that seemed to increase the probability that a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF could be approved by January,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nMacro environment supportive of crypto\n\nThe macro-environment also continues to support crypto, Thielen said, with Matrixport anticipating another halving of inflation toward 1.6% and a decline in bond yields to 2.60% by 2024 or 2025, following the peak of the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield at 4.95% in this cycle.\n\nThe adjustment in bond yields is expected to usher in a surge for the stock market, which often correlates with cryptocurrencies, the analyst added."

        "content": "Bitcoin Sender Mistakenly Overpays Record $3M in Transaction Fees\n\nA Bitcoin (BTC) sender made a costly error by paying an unprecedented $3 million in transaction fees for a single transaction. The sender intended to send 139.42 BTC, valued at around $5.1 million, but mistakenly lost 83.64 BTC in fees, leaving the recipient with only 55.77 BTC, approximately $2 million. This transaction fee sets a new record in Bitcoin's history.\n\nAccording to blockchain data from Bitinfocharts, the transaction was processed by Bitcoin miner AntPool in block 818087. While Bitcoin transactions can be expensive during busy periods, data from Bitinfocharts indicates that the average transaction fee on the Bitcoin network is currently $14.1.\n\nIn September, stablecoin issuer Paxos paid a $500,000 fee for processing a transaction worth just $2,000. Fortunately, Bitcoin miner F2Pool agreed to refund the excessive payment in that instance.\n\nWhile this is a costly mistake, Bitcoin transaction fees have been surging lately due to growing interest in Bitcoin Ordinals. Ordinals are digital assets inscribed on the smallest unit of Bitcoin, called a satoshi. The inclusion of Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain has increased network activity, resulting in higher transaction costs.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Bitcoin Smart Contracts and Apps: Do They Even Exist? - Ledger",
        "content": "Bitcoin Smart Contracts and Apps: Do They Even Exist?\n\nBy Mohammad Musharraf\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Bitcoin supports smart contracts through its native language \u2018Script\u2019, enabling multiple transaction types to take place.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Script is a purposefully non-Turing complete language and this makes smart contracts on Bitcoin limited in their functionality.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Layer-2 blockchains and solutions are present for Bitcoin to improve its smart contract offerings while keeping its security intact.\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s first blockchain and cryptocurrency. Its primary use case is peer-to-peer payment transfers. Often Bitcoin is referred to as digital gold, with it offering a secure and decentralized way to store and manage value. This core value proposition is what led Bitcoin to become the most popular and widely used crypto network so far. And it\u2019s these same core values that many other networks have taken inspiration from while creating new use cases and innovations.\n\nTo explain, while Bitcoin was created purely to store and manage value in a decentralized manner, other networks expanded into other territories, creating ways to host decentralized applications. Decentralized apps (DApps) have taken the world by storm, and as such, there has been a push to create these types of apps that work using the most popular network, Bitcoin. However, this was not the reason Bitcoin was created, thus it\u2019s a bit more complex than many smart-contract-ready networks like Ethereum.\n\nSo how do Bitcoin\u2019s versions of smart contracts work? And what kinds of functions are available using this method?\n\nLet\u2019s explore the concept of Bitcoin smart contracts and dive into the different types of smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Have Smart Contracts?\n\nYes, the Bitcoin blockchain supports smart contracts. Developers can use Script, a scripting language, to write and deploy smart contracts on Bitcoin.\n\nSo, why is Bitcoin never the first thing people think when the topic of smart contracts pops up?\n\nOften, you\u2019ll hear people say Bitcoin is not \u201cTuring complete\u201d. But in fact, that\u2019s not quite true. Instead, it\u2019s all to do with something called opcodes. Or more, Bitcoin\u2019s lack of them.\n\nOpcodes are essentially small pieces of code that represent functions that can be executed on a specific network. On some blockchains, for example, Ethereum, some of these opcodes have the power to read and write the current \u201cstate\u201d of the blockchain. Then from there, you can combine many of these opcodes to create complex automated tasks triggered by a blockchain transaction. These groups of opcodes are better known as smart contracts and are responsible for countless blockchain apps and platforms.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin script doesn\u2019t contain these types of opcodes. That also means that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have a recorded current \u201cstate\u201d at any given moment. Instead, it simply records who owns what, and allows people to send and receive coins via UTXOs, with a limited choice of conditions of how that value transfer executes.\n\nSo, now you know why Bitcoin smart contracts aren\u2019t exactly what you might expect, so let\u2019s see how they work.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Smart Contracts and How Do They Work?\n\nBitcoin smart contracts, like their counterparts on other networks, are simply pieces of code that automatically execute when some predefined conditions are met. So, you can imagine, they work in a similar way.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s important to know that Bitcoin operates using its own computing language: Script. And script uses something like a lock and key system to execute smart contracts. The sender sets a condition or rule in order for the transaction to be processed \u2014 acting as the lock. To follow, the recipient must provide a matching \u201ckey\u201d \u2014also a piece of code in Script\u2014that fulfills the condition set by the sender.\n\nNow, what kind of conditions can be set?\n\nLet\u2019s find the answer to this by exploring the various types of smart contracts present on Bitcoin.\n\nTypes of Bitcoin Smart Contracts\n\nPay-to-public key hash scripts (P2PKH)\n\nThis is the most common type of transaction. The sender addresses Bitcoin to the receiver\u2019s public key\u2019s hash. To access the funds, the receiver must prove they own the corresponding private key.\n\nThis is like locking a box and giving the key to one person.\n\nMultisignature scripts (MultiSig)\n\nMultiSig requires more than one signature for a transaction to be valid. An example is a 2-of-3 MultiSig, which needs at least two signatures from a group of three to execute a transaction. This adds an extra layer of security and is often used by businesses.\n\nThis is like a safe that needs two or more keys turned at the same time.\n\nTime Locked Bitcoin Transactions (nLockTime and nSequence)\n\nThis allows a transaction to be created at any given time, but only be valid at a specified future date or block height. It\u2019s a way to \u2018postdate\u2019 a Bitcoin transaction and is useful for various financial agreements. It\u2019s a sort of timelock that pertains to transactions.\n\nTime-locked transactions were made possible with BIP-65 and BIP-112\u2019s introduction of new opcodes concerning the \u2018nLockTime\u2019 and nSequence fields.\n\nEssentially, these opcodes allow an entry to specify the earliest time it can be added to a block\u2014stopping the transaction from completing until a certain number of blocks, or amount of time has passed. In short, these time-locked opcodes are important, as without them the entire Lightning network could not exist!\n\nPay to Script Hash (P2SH \u2013 BIP16)\n\nInstead of locking outputs to a public key, P2SH locks them to a script\u2019s hash. The spender needs to provide the script matching the hash and satisfy its conditions. This enables complex scripts without burdening the sender with their details. P2SH came into play with the BIP-16 upgrade.\n\nFor instance, you challenge a friend with a puzzle. If they solve it, they get the bitcoins.\n\nPay-to-taproot (P2TR \u2013 BIP341)\n\nP2TR is a privacy-preserving complex script that allows multiple parties to create a signature that looks like a single one, enhancing privacy and efficiency.\n\nIt is a combination of P2PKH and P2SH with a lot more privacy. This was part of the BIP-341 proposal, popularly known as the Taproot upgrade.\n\nMiniscript\n\nMiniscript was introduced to make the complex spending conditions (that Bitcoin was already capable of) much easier for developers to use and implement. In short, it\u2019s a simple coding language that facilitates a number of functionalities. Essentially it allows your Bitcoin wallet to handle more advanced actions like requiring multiple keys for an account or having a wallet with some spending conditions that are only active after some amount of time.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t strictly a smart contract, this is one of the more flexible custody schemes miniscript offers.\n\nNow that you know about some advanced functions, let\u2019s dig into something more tangible.\n\nWhat about NFTs on Bitcoin \u2014 do they even exist in the first place?\n\nTokens and NFTs on Bitcoin\n\nThe Ordinals protocol launched on Bitcoin in January 2023, enabling \u201cOrdinal NFTs\u201d by attaching data to individual Satoshis. Each Satoshi gets a unique number through an intuitive ordering system.\n\nOrdinal NFTs reside fully on the Bitcoin blockchain without the need for a separate token. However, that means, inscribed Satoshis now compete for block space on the network, resulting in a spike in network fees.\n\nBRC-20 \u2014 a token standard for Bitcoin Ordinals \u2014 uses JSON data to facilitate various token functions. At present, the BRC-20 token standard offers three primary functions:\n\nDeploy: This function allows users to create a new BRC-20 token contract.\n\nThis function allows users to create a new BRC-20 token contract. Mint: Users can use the mint function to generate a specific amount of BRC-20 tokens.\n\nUsers can use the mint function to generate a specific amount of BRC-20 tokens. Transfer: The transfer function enables users to send a certain amount of BRC-20 tokens to another address.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard is relatively new and young. Hence, the functionalities are limited and not entirely user-friendly.\n\nBitcoin L2s or layer-2 solutions can help Bitcoin overcome this limitation.\n\nSmart Contracts on Bitcoin Layer 2s\n\nBitcoin smart contracts have limited functionalities. However, layer-2 blockchains on Bitcoin allow developers to code more complicated smart contracts.\n\nTo better understand how they work, let\u2019s look at a few examples of Bitcoin layer 2 chains.\n\nLightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network (LN) is a layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin, designed to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions by conducting most of the transactions off-chain. It operates using payment channels which are like private off-chain tunnels between users that facilitate payments.\n\nApart from instant payments and low fees, LN enables the creation of more complex smart contracts like Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) within \u201cLightning Apps\u201d or \u201cLApps.\u201d These contracts are programmable, most often implemented for functions such as micropayments, instant swaps, and streaming payments.\n\nThe Lightning network is also home to Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs). To clarify these contracts allow two parties to engage in a bet, using a connection to an oracle to verify real-life events. While the oracle is crucial for the settlement of these bets, it is not directly involved in the transactions that create and settle the contract. These are directly negotiated among the parties making the bet.\n\nStacks\n\nStacks is a chain that works alongside Bitcoin. It enables developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Bitcoin.\n\nThey employ \u201cProof of Transfer\u201d (PoX) \u2014 an approach to allowing the Stacks blockchain to process its transactions while leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\nSmart Contracts on Stacks\n\nUsing Stacks, developers can create a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized social networks.\n\nIt acts as a more diverse and expansive ecosystem while maintaining the robustness and security of Bitcoin as the base layer.\n\nTwo applications of Stacks-based smart contracts on Bitcoin are:\n\nHiro Wallet: It is a non-custodial wallet enabling secure connections and transactions within the Stacks ecosystem. Bitcoin users can participate in Stacking, a reward system that distributes BTC to users for supporting the network and locking STX tokens for a specified period.\n\nBitcoin Naming Service (BNS): BNS, a decentralized name system for Bitcoin, similar to Ethereum\u2019s ENS, saw a recent surge in registrations. To own a BTC name, users have to interact with the smart BNS contract on the Stacks chain.\n\nStart using smart contracts on Bitcoin\n\nUnderstanding how Bitcoin smart contracts work is imperative to participate safely in crypto and DeFi. It\u2019s even better when a user can understand smart contract code to assess if a smart contract is safe to interact with.\n\nAnd as with using smart contracts on any blockchain, you should prioritize the security of your private keys. The best way to do that is to use Bitcoin applications through a hardware wallet like Ledger.\n\nLedger hardware wallets keep private keys offline at all times and also enable clear signing. This helps users clearly read the transaction details before they approve it.\n\nMoreover, Ledger hardware wallets offer support to Hiro Wallet by which users can pair them and start stacking STX and delegating them to trustworthy validators.\n\nNow you know everything about smart contracts on Bitcoin, you\u2019re ready to dive in. So get yourself a Ledger, connect to Ledger Live, and start exploring the Bitcoin ecosystem. The time for education is now, and accessing Bitcoin from the Ledger ecosystem is secure and easy to understand."

The pre-transaction balance was 139.42 BTC ($5.2 million), with the user overpaying by 120,528 times, according to Bitcoin explorer Mempool.\n\nThe address used to make the payment was activated earlier today, making three Bitcoin transactions before a fourth incurred the record fee. The receiving address is also relatively new, dating back to October 16.\n\nThe transaction was mined by AntPool in block 818,087, according to the blockchain explorer Blockchair. AntPool has not yet publicly commented on the transaction and did not immediately return a request for comment from The Block.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nPaxos\u2019 $500,000 fee was returned\n\nThe previous record $500,000 fee paid in September was subsequently identified as a \u201cfat finger\u201d overpayment by the crypto services provider Paxos.

        "content": "Bitcoin is trading at its highest level in more than 18 months, with its price up more than 100 per cent since the start of 2023.\n\nThe rally has pushed bitcoin\u2019s market cap above $700 billion and the overall crypto market close to $1.5 trillion. The figure is still a long way from its all-time high of around $3 trillion, which was reached at the end of 2021, however some crypto analysts believe the recent gains are the beginning of another record-breaking run.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate \u2013 which denotes how much computing power is required to verify transactions and generate new units of the cryptocurrency through a process called mining \u2013 hit a record high this week, according to data from Blockchain.com.\n\nThis signals a resilient network, with hopes of future price gains attracting an increasing number of miners.

The uptick comes after representatives from BlackRock (BLK) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to discuss the asset manager's spot bitcoin ETF filing.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF is a financial product that investors hope will open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nAfter the news of the BlackRock meeting, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap (BTC-USD) is now changing hands for $37,345, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBlackRock representatives meet with the SEC\n\nAccording to an SEC memorandum, BlackRock had a meeting with the financial regulatory body about their proposed spot bitcoin ETF product, called the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nRead more: Spot bitcoin ETF approval unlikely this year, says analyst\n\nThe details of the meeting include a presentation on how BlackRock could use an in-kind or in-cash redemption model for its iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nThe memorandum from the SEC did not indicate how the regulator responded to BlackRock's proposed redemption models.\n\n\"Looks like BlackRock also met with SEC! There\u2019s a couple slides in relation to in-kind vs cash creation. Based on this it looks like BlackRock prefers in-kind for their bitcoin ETF, makes sense as its probably cleanest structure for them and end investors,\" Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart posted on X.com.\n\nSEC also held ETF meeting with Grayscale\n\nSeyffart referred to another spot bitcoin ETF meeting that occurred this week between the SEC and another fund manager. SEC officials met with Grayscale representatives on Monday as part of the firm\u2019s bid for listing a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nAccording to that memorandum from the SEC, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, legal chief Craig Salm and other executives met with the SEC\u2019s division of trading and markets. The memo said discussions \u201cconcerned NYSE Arca, Inc.\u2019s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Institutional investment brings new momentum to crypto\n\nThe meetings between the SEC and fund managers have been interpreted by analysts as signaling progress toward potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF filing.\n\nIn late August of this year, Grayscale Investments won a key legal battle in its struggle to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nOn August 29, Judge Neomi Rao of the US District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC was incorrect in rejecting Grayscale\u2019s application to convert the GBTC into a spot ETF. The SEC had initially rejected the application in June 2022, citing insufficient safe practices and fraud protection mechanisms.\n\nAdvantages of a spot bitcoin ETF\n\nThe approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could bestow several advantages on the cryptocurrency sector. Firstly, the regulatory oversight of such an ETF under the jurisdiction of the SEC would contribute to bitcoin's credibility.\n\nRead more: US crypto crackdown 'an opportunity for the UK'\n\nAdditionally, the accessibility of ETFs to the general public would facilitate more widespread bitcoin investment. The SEC's role in upholding rigorous standards is seen as a factor that enhances investor protection.\n\nAn approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF also holds the potential for substantial investments from pension and mutual funds, potentially directing billions into the cryptocurrency market and fostering institutional adoption.\n\nWatch: US crypto crackdown 'an opportunity for the UK' | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "The conventional wisdom of the cryptoverse is that there is a boom-and-bust cycle to the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. This cycle is led by the \u201cKing of Cryptos,\u201d Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is programmatically set to have a halving cycle roughly every four years, which cuts the supply of new coins awarded to miners in half. The halving sends a supply shock to the market, and as seen in the past three cycles, this under- and overvaluation in the market is partially responsible for the dramatic ups and downs.\n\nOther factors also play critical roles in this cycle, including overall network adoption, expanded use cases for Bitcoin \u2014 like the Lightning Network for scalability and Ordinals for nonfungible tokens \u2014 and the ever-popular \u201cinstitutional adoption.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Dan Held, a Bitcoin educator and marketing adviser for Trust Machines, predicted that Bitcoin would eventually see a \u201csupercycle,\u201d citing the increased value of the network as adoption grows (Metcalfe\u2019s law), increased scarcity due to the halving and increased institutional adoption.\n\nThis supercycle will, theoretically, see Bitcoin run up to new all-time highs, from which there will be no further downside, as there will be enough adoption and institutional support to continue to prop up the price.\n\nCrypto winter sets in at the end of 2021\n\nThis support did not occur in the last cycle, and Bitcoin fell from its all-time high of $69,000 at the end of 2021, bringing the rest of the market down with it. All those factors of reduced supply, greater network growth, and more business and institutional support were not enough to support the meteoric rise.\n\nInstitutional support was growing so much during the last leg of the cycle that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved around the world. The first physically-backed BTC ETF was launched in Canada in February 2021 by Purpose Investments.\n\nSince then, Canada has also approved the CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF and Evolve Bitcoin ETF. In Germany, there is the ETC Group Physical Bitcoin ETF, while Brazil and Australia also launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2021 and 2022. Yet these products did not provide the institutional support many believe will come from ETFs.\n\nHowever, the various stock markets worldwide do not compare to the United States.\n\nThe European Union makes up 11.1% of global equity markets, while Australia and Canada make up 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively. All these markets combined are dwarfed by the United States, which comprises 42.5% of all global equity markets.\n\nThis does lend some weight to the idea that this cycle may hold the promise of Held\u2019s \u201cBitcoin supercycle,\u201d as the largest country in all global equity markets may soon allow spot Bitcoin ETFs to trade.\n\nBlackRock, one of the most prominent names in asset management and investment circles, applied for its own spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023, providing a kind of green light for other institutions to start getting involved. However, institutions are only one factor here.\n\nAdoption may be an emerging market trend\n\nAccording to Chainalysis\u2019 recent \u201c2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,\u201d India, Nigeria and Vietnam were the top three countries for crypto adoption in 2023. The rankings were based on an index score that looked at centralized services, retail services, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, decentralized finance (DeFi) and retail DeFi value received.\n\nThe U.S. makes up North America\u2019s largest percentage of transaction volume, and the country ranked fourth overall. As the chart below shows, North America had the largest percentage of large institutional transfers but some of the lowest amounts of small and large retail.\n\nRecent: Former Coinbase exec posits blockchain-driven vision of future societies\n\nThis differentiation is important, as the market value of a commodity is not derived from centralized entities but rather from decentralized independent actors perceiving value in the commodity. As the Chainalysis report and Cointelegraph Research\u2019s recent \u201cInvesting in DeFi\u201d report suggest, investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is akin to emerging markets investing at this stage in the adoption cycle.\n\nParticipants, not institutions, bring value\n\nWhile institutional adoption will undoubtedly be an essential factor if and when the Bitcoin supercycle takes hold, Bitcoin itself needs to have perceived value from market participants, or it will not have the staying power. History is replete with examples of thriving industries that were superseded by a new technology the market found helpful and that toppled giants practically overnight.\n\nThe introduction of petroleum products completely overturned the whaling industry in the mid-1800s. There was a vast industry and institutions behind global whaling interests with boats, trade and infrastructure. Still, no matter how much money was behind it, the market saw better use with the new products.\n\nMore recently, and closer to the technological innovation led by the blockchain revolution, the dot-com bubble of the mid-1990s and early 2000s saw various companies overvalued. Part of the overvaluation was based on the assumption that adoption would be more rapid than what actually happened.\n\nSignals such as the internet browser Netscape seeing 3 million downloads in three months had investors excited about what the rest of the industry could do.\n\nIn 1995, Netscape had a successful initial public offering, backed by institutions like Morgan Stanley, which pushed the stock price from $14 to $28 \u2014 valuing the not-yet profitable 16-month-old company at over $1 billion.\n\nInvestors kept looking for the next Netscape among the slew of Silicon Valley companies, and money poured into the space. In economics, the very height of the boom cycle, where overvaluation is at its apex just before the bust, is called the \u201cMinsky moment.\u201d\n\nThe dot-com bubble\u2019s Minsky moment came in 2002. There was a ton of investor sentiment and institutional money flowing around, but there was no underlying adoption of many of the companies that saw investments. Nothing was ultimately there to support these companies and their value.\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market rose dramatically between 1995 and 2000, peaking in March 2000 at 5,048.62 before falling 76.81% to 1,139.90 in October 2002. Without customers and the actual usage of these firms\u2019 services in the market, there was nothing to keep the overvaluation afloat.\n\nWhat does this mean for Bitcoin?\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, \u201cThere\u2019s no sugarcoating it: Worldwide grassroots crypto adoption is down.\u201d However, as stated previously, lower-middle-income (LMI) countries \u2014 like India, Nigeria and Ukraine \u2014 have seen increased adoption.\n\n\u201cLMI is the only category of countries whose total grassroots adoption remains above where it was in Q3 2020, just before the most recent bull market,\u201d its report states.\n\nWhile the United States may be fourth in terms of crypto adoption, it\u2019s not driven by P2P Bitcoin transactions, as the U.S. ranked 12th in that category.\n\nRather, stablecoin trading took the lion\u2019s share of transactions, with Bitcoin generally trading less than altcoins. Bitcoin is not currently a widespread medium of exchange in America.\n\nThis is not due to Bitcoin\u2019s lack of perceived value on the market but rather the lack of necessity for Americans to use it for payments.\n\nLMI countries are seeing greater adoption due to high inflationary monetary issues within their respective countries, and Bitcoin, as much as it fluctuates, can be a better alternative than holding domestic currency.\n\nAs the world continues with the trend of dedollarization, the flight to safety could be Bitcoin.\n\nCould this happen in the United States as well?\n\nThe three major credit rating firms \u2014 Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P), Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings \u2014 have all downgraded the U.S.\u2019 credit rating.\n\nIn August 2011, S&P lowered the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+. Fitch followed suit in August 2023. And on Nov. 10, 2023, Moody\u2019s lowered its outlook on the U.S. credit rating from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing growing deficits and decreased ability to pay back the national debt.\n\nThe drops in credit ratings signal decreasing confidence in the U.S. and, by extension, the standing of the U.S. dollar being the central unit of account for global settlement.\n\nIf hyperinflation starts to rear its head in the U.S., it is possible that alternatives will be used instead of holding onto cash.\n\nChances are it\u2019s super early in this cycle\n\nWhile Held introduced the idea of a Bitcoin supercycle, he has frequently said that people are still early in terms of getting into stacking sats. While increased institutional adoption may give Bitcoin a rise in fiat value and greater routes for investment, all the following elements must be in play for the supercycle to be in full swing:\n\nInstitutional demand: Assuming BlockRock and the other financial powerhouses are granted spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., the amount of investment from institutions, family offices, sovereign wealth funds and high-net-worth individuals could give Bitcoin support in raising the fiat value to a certain level. Galaxy Digital, for example, predicts this will bring Bitcoin up to around the $59,000 level.\n\nSupply: The next Bitcoin halving event will occur around April 2024 at block height 840,000, and 96.9% of all the existing BTC will have been mined. This means the supply part of the supercycle equation is checked. Even if grassroots demand stays the same, this would indicate a higher fiat price. Still, as was seen in previous cycles, a price increase (\u201cnumber-go-up\u201d technology) will likely increase demand, at least in the short term, due to fear of missing out.\n\nAdoption: While some may buy Bitcoin for \u201cnumber-go-up\u201d reasons, its actual use will give it a long-term value proposition. It is yet unknown whether America\u2019s economic and sociopolitical climate will nudge people to adopt Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, a store of wealth or a hedge against further dollar inflationary pressure.\n\nWhat are the probabilities of a 2024 Bitcoin supercycle?\n\nCointelegraph asked billionaire venture capitalist and serial blockchain investor Tim Draper what he thought the possibilities were for a 2024 Bitcoin supercycle. According to him, \u201cI think it will be the following cycle, when we can run our businesses unimpeded by regulatory uncertainty, where we can buy our food, clothing, shelter and taxes all in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nJulian Liniger, CEO of Bitcoin-only exchange Relai, told Cointelegraph that the market \u201cwill see a drastic reduction in supply due to the upcoming halving, while Bitcoin ETFs and the generally increasing interest in the asset Bitcoin mean a significantly higher demand.\u201d\n\nLiniger added that factors like a loss of confidence in fiat currencies, increased banking oversight and the collapse of exchanges like FTX \u201cstrengthen the Bitcoin narrative.\u201d\n\nMagazine: This is your brain on crypto: Substance abuse grows among crypto traders\n\n\u201cWith BlackRock and other major players on board, I also think it\u2019s not unlikely that we will see a radical 180-degree turn in the public perception of Bitcoin. Instead of a speculative asset that consumes as much electricity as entire countries, Bitcoin could soon be seen as a safe haven promoting the transition to renewable energies,\u201d he said.\n\nBitget managing director Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph that in order for the supercycle to happen, \u201cThe market needs ample funds to counter negative sentiments. Firstly, reestablishing easy access channels between traditional finance and the crypto market, especially after the suppression of three crypto-friendly banks. Secondly, global governments, including the U.S., must officially recognize Bitcoin assets as equal to gold and stocks. This involves removing restrictions on the trading and holding of Bitcoin for the general public. Such integration with traditional finance provides the foundation for widespread Bitcoin adoption and creates favorable conditions for the Bitcoin superycle to materialize.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin supercycle is likely not upon the world for this continued adoption cycle. There is simply too much speculation over adoption and daily usage happening globally for the asset to have no or just a soft correction to cushion the fall once the Minsky moment pops the bubble. 2028, on the other hand, may be a different story altogether.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

There's no clear reason for the jump, but it could have something to do with the proposal submitted by StableLab (a governance service provider) that seeks to delegate 10 million UNI from the DAO\u2019s treasury to underrepresented delegates. The proposal is awaiting an on-chain vote. Other altcoins also rallied, including collapsed crypto exchange FTX\u2019s FTT token, which gained 10% on the day. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, added almost 3% and hovered around $37,400. \u201cTechnically speaking, dips have been exceptionally well supported and bitcoin looks to be readying for a push to fresh yearly highs and towards a test of next key resistance in the form of the $40k barrier,\u201d said LMAX Digital in a morning note."

        "content": "A Bitcoin user paid 83.7 Bitcoin (BTC), worth $3.1 million, in transaction fees for transferring 139.42 BTC. The transaction fee of $3.1 million is the eight-highest in Bitcoin\u2019s 14-year history.\n\nThe BTC wallet address bc1qn3d\u2026wekrnl tried transferring 139.42 BTC to bc1qyf\u2026km36t4 on Nov. 23, only to pay more than half the actual value in the transaction fee. The destination address received only 55.77 BTC. The mining pool Antpool captured the absurdly high mining fee on block 818087.\n\nAntpool mining reward history. Source: Mempool\n\nUsers on social media suggested that the sender may have selected the high transaction fee, but the replace-by-fee (RBF) node policy and the sender\u2019s unawareness also appear to have played a part. RBF allows an unconfirmed transaction in the mempool to be replaced with a different transaction that pays a higher transaction fee to get it cleared earlier. The mempool is where all BTC transactions are queued before approval and addition to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nA mempool developer who goes by mononaut on X (formerly Twitter) said the user behind the transfer probably didn\u2019t know RBF orders cannot be canceled. The user might have repeatedly replaced the fees in hopes of canceling it. The RBF history indicates that the last replacement increased the fee by another 20%, adding 12.54824636 BTC in fees.\n\nRBF history of the 83.7 BTC transaction fee. Source: Mempool\n\nThis is not the first time a Bitcoin user accidentally sent an absurdly high transaction fee for a single Bitcoin transaction. In September, Bitcoin exchange platform Paxos accidentally sent a $500,000 transaction fee for a $2,000 BTC transfer. In that incident, the F2Pool miner who verified the transaction returned the $500,000 accidental transaction fee to Paxos.\n\nHowever, this is the largest Bitcoin transaction fee ever paid in dollar terms, knocking the September Paxos transfer of $500,000 off its unfortunate podium. The largest fee in Bitcoin terms was paid in 2016 when someone accidentally sent 291 BTC in transaction fees.\n\nRelated: Binance\u2019s DOJ settlement offers a glimmer of hope for the crypto industry\n\nMononaut told Cointelegraph that although the current instance of an accidental transaction fee has similarities to the Paxos case, the possibility that Antpool would return the funds would depend on their own payout policies, \u201dwhich might have implications for what obligations they have to share transaction fees with their miners.\u201d\n\nAntpool has yet to comment on the issue and has yet to respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s requests for comments.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

And while the asset management giant indeed wants to bring such a product to market, it does not yet have approval.\n\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Uncle Jim says as he collects another forkful of mashed potatoes. \u201cI can\u2019t say I know much about it beyond all the headlines.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right \u2014 the story has been the subject of numerous stories in recent months.

About a dozen companies \u2014 including Ark Invest and 21Shares, as well as Fidelity, Invesco and Bitwise \u2014 have similar proposals before the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nGrayscale Investments has said its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is ready to operate as an ETF upon receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.\n\nYour dad\u2019s brother then asks: \u201cSo, do you think this whole bitcoin ETF thing will happen then? And what\u2019s the big deal anyway?\u201d\n\nRead more: To gauge impact of bitcoin spot ETF, analysts look to gold\n\nFeel free to opine on the topic if you wish. But here are some facts to have at the ready.\n\nFirst, the SEC has consistently blocked bitcoin ETFs from coming to market for a decade or so. These funds, if approved, would hold BTC directly and give investors exposure to the asset within an investment vehicle accessible via traditional brokerage accounts.\n\nETFs \u2014 which hold roughly $7 trillion in assets \u2014 are a tool used by retail investors and financial advisers alike.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts say they think the chance of spot bitcoin ETF approval by Jan. 10 \u2014 the SEC\u2019s deadline to rule on a bitcoin ETF proposal by Ark Invest and 21Shares \u2014 is 90%.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cBut what are they basing that on?\u201d Uncle Jim asks. \u201cWhy would the SEC all of a sudden approve a bitcoin ETF?\u201d\n\nThere are a few factors at play here, and you could explain \u2014 if he has the patience to listen, since Ol\u2019 Jim\u2019s eyes may have found the Lions game on the television behind you. Perhaps Jared Goff connected with Amon-Ra St. Brown for a go-ahead score. When did Detroit\u2019s football team get good?\n\nBut back to bitcoin ETFs \u2014 what\u2019s different now?\n\nBlackRock filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June certainly turned heads. The company manages more than $9 trillion in assets and has only ever had one product proposal denied by the SEC in nearly 600 attempts, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. BlackRock\u2019s push spurred a new wave of bitcoin ETF proposals across the financial sector.\n\nElsewhere, Grayscale won a court case against the SEC in August \u2014 a ruling that limits the criteria on which it would be able to deny the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF, should it try to do so again.\n\nThe SEC had a chance to challenge the legal decision as late as last month, but opted not to.\n\nBeyond that, fund issuers have amended their bitcoin ETF proposals, signaling an ongoing dialogue with the SEC.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n21Shares president Ophelia Snyder said during a Monday interview on Bloomberg TV that there has been a \u201cpattern break\u201d as issuers have begun to offer more information on what these products would look like.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really positive, because, very candidly, change in behavior might actually result in a change of outcome,\u201d Snyder added.\n\nAs recently as Monday, members of the SEC\u2019s division of trading and markets met with executives from BlackRock and Nasdaq about the proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\n\u201cI guess only time will tell,\u201d Uncle Jim concludes at the dinner table, seemingly ready to move on to dessert.\n\nRight he is.\n\nThe table topic indeed shifts.

        "title": "Opinion: Blockchain, the Backbone of Bitcoin, Has Power to Increase Accountability and Transform Industries - Sacramento Observer",
        "content": "By Samuel Houston | Special to California Black Media Partners\n\n(WIB) \u2013 The rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has sparked a revolution that holds the promise of greater financial accountability. While many may view cryptocurrencies as nothing more than speculative assets, to better understand the transformative power they have, it is crucial to delve deeper into the underlying blockchain technology that supports them.\n\nBlockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, is essentially a decentralized ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This ledger is immutable and transparent, making it virtually tamper-proof. Transactions are grouped into \u201cblocks,\u201d and each block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain of blocks, hence the name \u201cblockchain.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s common to hear people talk about investing in cryptocurrencies without fully comprehending the intricacies of blockchain technology. While it\u2019s not necessary for every user to be a blockchain expert, a basic understanding of how it works can help one appreciate the significance of this innovation.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of blockchain technology is its wide range of use cases. Beyond serving as the backbone of cryptocurrencies, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including agriculture, entertainment, real estate, and retail.\n\nIn the agricultural industry, it enables the tracking of agricultural products from farm to table, recording information such as seed quality, crop growth, and the journey of a plant post-farm. This transparency ensures the authenticity of food products, reduces fraud, and enhances food safety. TE-FOOD has already revolutionized the tracing application\n\nof blockchain technology, providing over 150 million people access to farm-to-table foods across the globe.\n\nBlockchain-based platforms are revolutionizing the entertainment industry by ensuring fair compensation to artists and content creators through smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries. Artists and creators can receive fair compensation for their work through transparent and automatic royalty payments, eliminating intermediaries who often take a substantial cut. Companies like Hollywoodland and Decentralized Pictures are even leveraging crypto tokens and blockchain to identify emerging talent and finance projects.\n\nReal estate transactions frequently entail multiple intermediaries, leading to high fees and lengthy processes. However, blockchain technology can greatly simplify property transactions, rendering them more efficient, secure, and cost-effective. For instance, Docuwalk by ShelterZoom used blockchain to oversee every facet of the real estate offer and acceptance procedure. This secure online platform meticulously documents each step in the journey towards finalizing a real estate deal, thereby guaranteeing an immutable financial record, and enhancing consumer protection.\n\nConsumers are already reaping the rewards of blockchain technology within the retail sector. Starbucks has leveraged blockchain technology to enhance customer satisfaction through a loyalty program that enables customers to accumulate rewards points from every purchase made at their stores. These accumulated points can later be redeemed for valuable rewards. Similarly, Walmart has adopted blockchain technology to offer loyalty programs, granting reward points to all customers who make purchases at their stores.\n\nOne of the key features of cryptocurrency that often comes under scrutiny is its financial accountability. Critics argue that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes it challenging to hold individuals accountable for illicit activities. While it\u2019s true that there is no centralized middleman, it\u2019s essential to recognize that blockchain\n\ntechnology itself provides a level of accountability that traditional financial systems cannot match.\n\nEvery transaction on the blockchain is recorded and publicly accessible, making it possible to trace the flow of funds. This transparency can deter fraudulent activities and provide a level of financial accountability that is often lacking in traditional banking systems.\n\nCritics may contend that the absence of intermediaries means users must take responsibility for their financial transactions, which can be challenging for some. However, this very aspect empowers individuals to have greater control over their finances. With cryptocurrencies, you are your bank, and you can manage your assets directly, without reliance on third parties.\n\nCryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have ushered in a new era of financial accountability and empowerment. While it\u2019s essential for users to educate themselves and exercise responsibility, the benefits of transparency, efficiency, and reduced reliance on intermediaries cannot be understated. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are not merely speculative assets but represent a significant step towards a more accountable and decentralized financial future, ultimately putting power back in the hands of the people.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSamuel Houston is a Fresno resident. He views cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies as a way for the Black community to take control of their finances and as another means to support his daughter."

        "content": "After a long and dramatic presidential race, libertarian candidate Javier Milei triumphed in Argentina\u2019s presidential election on Nov. 19.\n\nMilei promises to abolish the country\u2019s central bank, among a slew of other radical policy changes capturing the attention and imagination of the crypto community.\n\nWith 99% of the vote counted on Sunday, Nov. 19, Milei was declared the winner. The flamboyant politician secured the favor of 55% of the electorate, with three million more ballots to his name than rival Sergio Massa.\n\nFernando Nikoli\u0107, an Argentine Bitcoin (BTC) advocate and founder of media analyst firm Bitcoin Perception, told Cointelegraph that Milei \u201chas spoken positively about Bitcoin when asked about it in interviews,\u201d but also pointed out that enthusiasm should be tempered by the fact that \u201cpassing any sort of law that is considered \u2018Bitcoin-friendly\u2019 is not a part of his official program.\u201d\n\nNikoli\u0107 added that as an advocate for free market money, Milei is also unlikely to pass any laws that would harm Bitcoin.\n\nIv\u00e1n Paz, the CEO of crypto trading platform Trading Different, took a positive view of the election results. According to Paz, Milei\u2019s free market policy agenda is likely to reinvigorate Argentina\u2019s flagging economy.\n\n\u201cArgentina will enter a cycle of accelerated economic recovery, driven by the confidence of local and foreign investors,\u201d Paz told Cointelegraph. \u201cThe reduction of the tax burden and the legal guarantee will once again make Argentina an attractive country to project in the long term.\u201d\n\nMany Argentinians now look forward to sweeping reforms. Camilo Jorajur\u00eda de Le\u00f3n, vice-president of Bitcoin Argentina, reminded the incoming president to keep his electoral promises:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is for monetary freedom, and that was precisely one of the proposals of the president-elect. As Bitcoiners, we hope he fulfills his promise.\u201d\n\nMilei\u2019s first task in office will be taming the nation\u2019s runaway inflation, which hit 143% in October. For comparison, United States inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 and is now 3.2%. With the spending power of the Argentine peso in freefall, it\u2019s little wonder that Argentinians voted for the candidate proposing to cut almost all public expenditure and big government.\n\nThe new politics of Argentina\n\nMilei promises to reinvent and reinvigorate Argentina\u2019s economy with a completely new approach. The beliefs that underpin the policy agenda of the libertarian anarcho-capitalist are likely to resonate with many in the crypto community.\n\nHis headline policies include \u201cblowing up\u201d the central bank to prevent money printing, ditching the peso in favor of the U.S. dollar and scrapping almost every form of welfare in the country.\n\nRecent: Can blockchain supply the guardrails to keep AI on course?\n\nThe president-elect confirmed his future plan for government departments in a dramatic video circulating on social media.\n\n\u201cMinistry of Sports and Tourism \u2014 out!\u201d said Milei. \u201cMinistry of Culture \u2014 out! Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development \u2014 out!\u201d\n\nIn the video, Milei punctuates every cut by tearing the name of the department off a whiteboard and tossing it aside.\n\nArgentina's new president and Donald Trump fan Javier Milei has promised to radically change the country. Could he succeed? Read more https://t.co/nU9XYLTqBN pic.twitter.com/Z8gYllY4JV \u2014 TalkTV (@TalkTV) November 22, 2023\n\nMilei on Bitcoin\n\nWhile President-elect Milei may embody a maverick spirit that appeals to Bitcoiners and the ideological proclivities of the cryptosphere, that is not the same thing as actively supporting it.\n\nThe president-elect previously outlined why Bitcoin is useful as a monetary instrument free from state control. In a video posted to Reddit\u2019s r/bitcoin 11 months ago, Milei states his position.\n\n\u201cWhat is the point? The point is that the first thing we have to understand is that the central bank is a scam,\u201d said Milei. \u201cIt is a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax. What Bitcoin is representing is the return of money to its original creator \u2014 the private sector.\u201d Milei adds:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the natural reaction against central banker scammers and to make the money private again.\u201d\n\nThe new president may praise Bitcoin as a financial instrument, but that is somewhat different from what Bitcoin advocates may wish for. Undoubtedly, there are those who hope Argentina will adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nWhat Bitcoiners think of Melei\n\nCointelegraph asked Nikoli\u0107 what the election of Milei means for cryptocurrency advocates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this will drastically alter the current landscape,\u201d Nikoli\u0107 said. \u201cArgentinians have been embracing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for many years. My hope is that, in the long term, Argentina becomes more entrepreneur-friendly, prosperous and free, helping to mend the significant cracks in the country\u2019s foundational structure.\u201d\n\nNikoli\u0107 added that the \u201cwidespread adoption of Bitcoin across the nation may be slow if 50% of its citizens live below the poverty line and lack an understanding of savings concepts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not something that can change overnight. Milei\u2019s policy broader economic policies will need time to bed in.\n\nAs for the million-dollar question: \u201cWill Bitcoin become legal tender in Argentina?\u201d Nikoli\u0107 suggests that legal tender certification may be marginally less important than it seems.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of the view that adoption is more robust when it emerges organically from the grassroots rather than being imposed top down. I\u2019m hopeful that Bitcoin adoption in Argentina will continue to flourish, especially as the country progresses under Milei\u2019s leadership and its people begin to experience improved living conditions.\u201d\n\nThe economics of Argentina\n\nSoaring inflation is not the only problem facing Milei in government. When the president-elect takes office on Dec. 10, he will take the reigns of a country facing a laundry list of economic challenges.\n\nChief among them is the fact that Argentina is the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) biggest borrower. The country owes the IMF a massive $31 billion.\n\nThe body gave the president a nod and a wink as early as Monday. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, was among those congratulating Milei on his electoral success.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working closely with him,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulations to President-elect Javier Milei @JMilei. We look forward to working closely with him and his administration in the period ahead to develop and implement a strong plan to safeguard macroeconomic stability and strengthen inclusive growth for all Argentinians. \u2014 Kristalina Georgieva (@KGeorgieva) November 20, 2023\n\nEconomist Nicol\u00e1s Litvinoff believes Milei will need to get the IMF monkey off his back as a matter of first priority.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is to regain autonomy in terms of monetary policy. On the one hand, to accumulate reserves in the central bank that are practically non-existent now,\u201d said Litvinoff before adding that Milei must \u201crestore the purchasing power of wages to reactivate consumption and the economy[\u2026] but for that, you need the International Monetary Fund out of the way.\u201d\n\nWho is Javier Milei?\n\nMilei first came to prominence as an economist, author and political commentator.\n\nWestern media outlets compare Milei to former U.S. President Donald Trump, but the similarities drawn are often shallow. Both men are populists from outside the political mainstream. Both men rode a wave of public disaffection to electoral success. Both men have unconventional hair.\n\nSuch comparisons are just as likely to obfuscate as enlighten.\n\nMilei was born in 1970 in Argentina\u2019s capital Buenos Aires. He was raised as a Catholic, which informs his politics to this day. While Milei is mostly socially liberal, he is opposed to both abortion and euthanasia. He supports freedom of choice on drugs, guns, prostitution and same-sex marriage.\n\nIn his youth, Milei sang in a Rolling Stones cover band. His presentation style owes much more to the rock world than to the political.\n\nDuring the campaign, Milei the showman brought a chainsaw to his rallies, frequently revving it up and raising it triumphantly above his head.\n\nRecent: Former Coinbase exec posits blockchain-driven vision of future societies\n\nFor supporters, Milei\u2019s chainsaw was a metaphor for the drastic cuts his administration would take to curb government spending and reign in inflation. For opponents, the chainsaw represented something else: a dangerous and cavalier individual waving around a chainsaw in public.\n\nThey dubbed him \u201cEl loco\u201d \u2014 the crazy one \u2014 or madman. That was little matter. Milei\u2019s message and style resonated with voters sick of the status quo, no matter how crazy he seemed to the doubters.\n\nAs for his rival Sergio Massa, the chainsaw took on a final, more ominous meaning as Milei cut him down this weekend in a very public chainsaw massacre. Now that Milei has the keys to the president\u2019s office, the clean-up of Argentina\u2019s broken system must begin."

The app remains available for download in other countries.\n\nThe Bitcoin Lightning app sought to assure existing users in the U.S. that their funds were accessible and can be withdrawn and transferred to another wallet service.\n\nUsers earlier speculated that the app may been banned in the U.S. as a result of the regulatory environment surrounding the crypto industry in the country, especially given the recent legal action taken against Binance and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The firm has come out saying it was its decision to remove the app.\n\n\u201cWallet of Satoshi needs to comply with local regulations or laws in ways that it cannot, or does not want to,\u201d John Carvalho, CEO of Bitcoin software developer Synonym, said in response.\n\nThe firm remains hopeful of a return in the country with future developments. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that future developments will allow us to revisit and possibly resume our operations in the U.S.,\u201d it added\n\nOne million Lightning transactions and near record capacity\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWallet of Satoshi is one of the most popular Bitcoin Lightning wallets and projected to process more than a record one million Lightning Network payments in November. Nonetheless, the firm has previously faced criticism for the custodial nature of its app, which retains control over users\u2019 funds, unlike non-custodial solutions that allow users to maintain full control over their bitcoin.\n\nWallet of Satoshi's decision to exit the U.S. market coincides with the Lightning Network\u2019s capacity rising back to all-time highs in both U.S. dollar and bitcoin terms, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.\n\nU.S. dollar capacity has jumped 67% over the last two months to reach $207 million, just shy of the $215 million record set in November 2021 at the peak of the bull market. Bitcoin capacity rose 20% over the same period to hit 5,530 BTC, slightly below the previous 5,640 BTC record set in July.\n\nWallet of Satoshi did not immediately return a request for comment from The Block."

        "content": "Allocating just 1% to Bitcoin in investment portfolios can drive outperformance and mitigate risk, K33 research suggests.\n\nThat blend outperforms conventional portfolios by 3.16% and withstands market volatility.\n\nBitcoin benefits investment portfolios through risk reduction despite long-held views in financial circles about the viability of cryptocurrencies in conservative investment strategies.\n\nIf investors allocate just 1% to Bitcoin in a traditional portfolio normally made up of 60% equities and 40% bonds, it can markedly improve its overall performance, according to a report from K33 Research on Tuesday.\n\nA 1% Bitcoin allocation would reduce equities and bonds allocation by 0.5%, respectively.\n\nThe findings suggest that such a blend not only withstands market volatility, but also surpasses the performance of the conventional model by 3.16%.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe report also cautions that while a modest Bitcoin investment can enhance a portfolio\u2019s performance, significant exposure can introduce greater volatility and risk.\n\n\u201cSize allocation is a matter of taste and risk appetite,\u201d Vetle Lund, a research analyst at K33, told DL News.\n\n\u201cReturns outpace excess volatility, but the enhanced volatility is a clear disincentivising feature for conservative savers,\u201d Lund said, referring to the typical investor building a 60/40 portfolio.\n\nOther factors beyond volatility could affect investors\u2019 decisions to allocate Bitcoin to portfolios.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cLiquidity plays a part, volatility plays another part, and so do correlation regimes,\u201d Lund told DL News.\n\nLiquidity refers to the ability of market participants to execute buy or sell orders close to the prevailing market price.\n\nIn low liquidity markets price moves can be exacerbated by a smaller number of trades, which can make investments in these markets less desirable.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s liquidity conditions have been slowly recovering after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year.\n\nChanging landscape\n\nBitcoin allocations to portfolios also boost diversification. While Bitcoin has gone through periods of extreme correlation with equities in the past, signs suggest that could be changing.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has [returned] to a somewhat unpredictable path, independent of macroeconomic factors,\u201d K33\u2032s report said.\n\n\u201cThis has implications as Bitcoin again shines as a powerful portfolio diversifier,\u201d it added.\n\nThe previously observed correlations between traditional assets and Bitcoin dissipated as the cryptocurrency rode the wave over potential approval of spot Bitcoin-based Exchange-Traded Funds.\n\nBitcoin became negatively correlated with major US stock indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite between mid-September and mid-November, according to data from The Block Research, as spot ETF approval looked increasingly likely.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are poised to appeal to conservative investors, offering a viable option to bolster the risk profile of their long-term savings portfolios.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission will start approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in the near future, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas told DL News on Monday. He expects approvals by mid-January.\n\nETFs represent Wall Street\u2019s gradual acceptance of crypto, Balchunas added.\n\n\u201cThese worlds have been trying to connect for 10 years. And they\u2019re just getting so close, they\u2019re like right there,\u201d he told DL News.\n\nAs these two worlds collide and ETFs simplify access to Bitcoin exposure, K33 expects \u201cdiversification and risk-adjusted outperformance to be key go-to-market strategies\u201d for asset managers.\n\nEntry point\n\nFidelity Digital Assets, the crypto arm of the $4.5 trillion asset manager, shared similar sentiment in an October report.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin offers a better risk versus return trade-off than other cryptocurrencies, Fidelity said. It should be considered an entry point for \u201ctraditional allocators.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s return profile is driven by two strong tailwinds,\u201d Fidelity analysts wrote, namely the global growth of the digital asset space and the potential instability of traditional macroeconomic conditions.\n\n\u201cThese Bitcoin return tailwinds are likely to be captured in an easier way with less risk than via the majority of other digital assets,\u201d the report said.\n\nOver two thirds of current institutional investors expect to increase allocations in cryptocurrencies in the next three years, a recent survey by Coinbase Institutional research found.\n\nAnother 45% of institutional investors surveyed without crypto allocations expect to allocate in the next three years.\n\nEkin Gen\u00e7 is a Managing Editor at DL News based in Oxford.

Despite its impressive performance lately and the anticipation of further gains in the near future, there is one advice that some cryptocurrency participants might find concerning.\n\nIt came from the well-known personality Jim Cramer \u2013 host of CNBC\u2019s TV show \u201cMad Money.\u201d He recently urged those like Bitcoin to increase their exposure to the primary digital asset:\n\n\u201cLook, if you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin. That has always been my view. And for a while, I liked it, and I decided that money had been made, but I was premature, but I made a lot of money.\u201d\n\nCramer has made countless comments and predictions involving the largest digital asset by market capitalization, and many times, those forecasts were far from spot on. This might be one reason why investors should be concerned of an inverse reaction and a potential BTC correction in the near future.\n\nWhen Was He Wrong?\n\nIn December last year, he advised individuals to sell their \u201cawful\u201d crypto positions, arguing it\u2019s never too late to exit the ecosystem. Recall that BTC has exploded over 100% since that counsel.\n\nOn another occasion, at the start of 2022 Cramer assumed the market correction was over, suggesting people should increase their exposure to Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital currencies. However, 2022 was far from profitable for crypto investors, witnessing severe collapses such as the Terra crash and the FTX meltdown."

Via this cooperation, we plan to offer an attractive digital investment platform early in 2024,\u201d the representative stated, adding:\n\n\u201cWe have seen the demand from customers for easy, intuitive, digital investment platforms. Our main intention to take customer-centric decisions has triggered these efforts, which we are excited about bringing to market.\u201d\n\nWith the crypto rollout, RLB N\u00d6-Wien users will gain access to all cryptocurrencies provided by the bank\u2019s partner Bitpanda, the spokesperson said.\n\nBitpanda Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad previously told Cointelegraph that Raiffeisen\u2019s crypto offering would support the full range of Bitpanda\u2019s digital asset offerings, which feature more than 2,500 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). The exec also said Raiffeisen was willing to make the crypto trading service available to all customer segments, including retail, private banking and corporate customers.\n\n\u201cAs we announced in April, the end goal is to make our offer available to all RLB N\u00d6-Wien customers. However, the rollout will begin with their customers in Vienna,\u201d a spokesperson for Bitpanda noted.\n\nRelated: Top Swiss bank launches Bitcoin and Ether trading with SEBA\n\nRaiffeisen\u2019s move into crypto is another sign of Bitcoin\u2019s growing adoption, with companies like Ferrari starting to accept cryptocurrency as payment in October 2023.

Discover SCENE\n\nA luckless Bitcoin sender seemingly made a costly mistake, paying a record-breaking $3 million in transaction fees for a single transaction.\n\nBlockchain data shows that the Bitcoin sender intended to send 139.42 BTC (worth around $5.1 million), of which 83.64 BTC was gobbled up in transaction fees, leaving the recipient with just 55.77 BTC (around $2 million at today\u2019s prices). The transaction fee is the largest such payment in the history of Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that today\u2019s payment was made by mistake: though making a Bitcoin transaction can be costly when the network is busy, fees are not supposed to exceed the amount being sent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin miner AntPool processed the transaction in block 818087, per blockchain data from Bitinfocharts.\n\nBitinfocharts shows that the current average price to make a transaction on the Bitcoin network stands at $10.51.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that someone has fat-fingered a Bitcoin transaction recently; in September crypto firm Paxos paid a $500,000 fee to process a transaction worth just $2,000, though Bitcoin miner F2Pool agreed to refund the overpayment.\n\nAlthough this incident appears to be a mistake on the part of the sender, Bitcoin transaction fees have shot up this month due to renewed hype surrounding Bitcoin Ordinals. Ordinals, similar to non-fungible tokens, are digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin.\n\nInscribing Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain means more activity on the network, which means it\u2019s busier and therefore more costly to make a transaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are options for those not wanting to pay much when sending or receiving the biggest cryptocurrency\u2014users are able to select lower fees before making a transaction. Though by doing so, they risk waiting around for hours as miners prioritize more lucrative transactions.\n\nAnd if the fee is too low, miners may completely ignore such transactions and it will never reach its destination."

Binance\u2019s bitcoin reserves have dropped by 5,000 BTC ($187 million). Meanwhile, Coinbase\u2019s reserves are up by 12,000 BTC ($450 million).\n\nBinance has historically used its bitcoin reserves to prop up the price of its proprietary token, BNB, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and several crypto analysts.

At press time, it sits at $233 \u2014 down 20% compared to this time last year.\n\nCZ controls a substantial percentage of BNB\u2019s $35 billion market cap. His recent $4 billion deal settled several US agency charges Binance faced \u2014 but the SEC\u2019s wash trading charges remain up in the air.\n\nProtos analysis has shown discrepencies in the amount of BNB held by Binance in its \u2018proof-of-reserves,\u2019 suggesting the crypto exchange has held far more than it cared to admit.\n\nCZ faces US detainment amid Binance bitcoin shedding\n\nUS prosecutors are pushing for CZ to be detained in the country, rather than allowing him to return to his home inn Dubai until his February sentencing. The former CEO is expected to face up to 18 months in prison for his role in failing to implement proper anti-money laundering checks.\n\nThe 46-year-old paid a $175 million release bond following his guilty plea.

And the $175 million bond he paid is mostly inaccessible to the government, the motion argued.\n\nGot a tip? Send us an email or ProtonMail.

Earlier today, BTC rocketed above $38,000 for the first time in a year and a half. In the last month, the coin has steadily climbed 10%. And it\u2019s not just Bitcoin that\u2019s up: in the same period, Ethereum has spiked 17%, hitting its own 18-month peak earlier Friday.\n\nMuch of that momentum stems from industry-wide hope for the imminent approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF\u2014which, if finally greenlit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after 10 years of denials, would allow traditional financial institutions to gain exposure to BTC without holding any cryptocurrency.\n\nBlockchain analysts at CryptoQuant have previously said the product could lead to a $1 trillion boost for Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCramer, despite having profited off BTC himself, appeared to permanently write off the coin and all other cryptocurrencies after the collapse of the crypto market in May 2022, and again after the shuttering of crypto exchange FTX rattled the industry last fall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never too late to sell an awful position, and that\u2019s what you have if you own these so-called digital assets,\u201d Cramer said last December.\n\nA year later, with Bitcoin back on the rise, Cramer\u2019s now claiming he\u2019s always supported those with long-term faith in the coin.\n\n\u201cIf you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin,\u201d the television personality said Tuesday. \u201cThat has always been my view.\u201d\n\nMany in the crypto and finance communities have long skewered Cramer\u2019s ever-shifting stances on financial products, with some claiming that doing the inverse of whatever he advises can generally be considered very sound financial advice.\n\nLast year, the SEC received multiple applications for real-life \u201cInverse Cramer ETFs,\u201d which would automatically invest user\u2019s funds using the opposite of Cramer\u2019s instructions as gospel.\n\nGiven such logic, some crypto investors have taken to social media to posit that Cramer\u2019s revived confidence in BTC could spell doom for the ascendant cryptocurrency\u2014and erase the encouraging gains of the last month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"
