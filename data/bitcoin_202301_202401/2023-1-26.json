        "title": "Bitcoin has shot up 50% since the new year, but here's why new lows are probably still ahead - The Conversation Indonesia",
        "content": "To the delight of investors across the cryptosphere, the price of bitcoin (BTC) has rallied over 53% since its low of US$15,476 (\u00a312,519) in November. Now trading around US$23,000, there\u2019s much talk that the bottom has finally been reached for the leading cryptocurrency after a year of painful decline \u2013 in November 2021, the price peaked at almost US$70,000.\n\nIf so, it\u2019s not only good news for bitcoin but the whole market in cryptocurrencies, since the others broadly move in line with the leader. So is crypto back in business?\n\nDotcom lessons\n\nThe past is littered with various periods of market turmoil, from the global financial crisis of 2007-09 to the COVID-19 collapse in 2020. But neither of these is a particularly good comparison for our purposes because they both saw sharp drops and recoveries, as opposed to the slow unwinding of bitcoin. A better comparison would be the dotcom bubble burst in 2000-02, which you can see in the chart below (the Nasdaq is the index that tracks all tech stocks).\n\nNasdaq 100 index 1995-2005\n\nLook at the bitcoin chart since it peaked in November 2021 and the price action looks fairly similar:\n\nBitcoin bear market price chart 2021-23\n\nBoth charts show that bear markets go through various periods where prices rise but don\u2019t reach the same level as the previous peak \u2013 known as \u201clower highs\u201d. If bitcoin is following a similar trajectory to the early 2000s Nasdaq, it would make sense that the current price will be another lower high and that it will be followed by another lower low.\n\nThis is partly because like the 2000s Nasdaq, bitcoin seems to be following a pattern known as an Elliott Wave. Named after the renowned American stock market analyst Ralph Nelson Elliott, this essentially argues that during a bear phase, investors shift between different emotional states of disappointment and hope, before they finally despair and decide the market will never turn in their favour. This is a final wave of heavy selling known as capitulation.\n\nYou can see this idea on the chart below, where bitcoin is the green and red line and Z is the potential capitulation point at around US$13,000 (click on the chart to make it bigger). The black line is the path that the Nasdaq took in the early 2000s. The blue pointing finger above that line is potentially the equivalent place to where the bitcoin price is now.\n\nBitcoin now vs Nasdaq in the early 2000s\n\nAuthor provided\n\nThe one other thing to note on the chart is the wavy line that\u2019s moving horizontally along the bottom. This is the stochRSI or stochastic relative strength index, which is an indication of when the asset looks overbought (when the line is peaking) or oversold (when it\u2019s bottoming).\n\nA sign of a coming shift is when the stochRSI moves in the opposite direction to where the price is heading: so now the stochRSI is coming down but the price has held up around US$23,000. This too suggests a fall could be imminent.\n\nThe game of wealth transfer\n\nWithin markets, there is often a game that investors from institutions such as banks and hedge funds play with amateur (retail) investors. The aim is to transfer retail investors\u2019 wealth to these institutions.\n\nThis is particularly easy in an unregulated market like bitcoin, because it is easier for institutions to manipulate prices. They can also talk up (or talk down) prices to stir up retail investors\u2019 emotions, and get them to buy at the top and sell at the bottom. This \u201ctraps\u201d the irrational investors who buy at higher prices, transferring wealth by giving the institutions an opportunity to convert their holdings into cash.\n\nIt therefore makes sense to compare how the retail and institutional investors have been behaving lately. The following charts compare those crypto wallet addresses that hold 1 BTC or more (mostly retail investors) with those holding upwards of 1,000 BTC (institutional investors). In all three charts, the black line is the bitcoin price and the orange line is the number of wallets in that category.\n\nRetail investor behaviour\n\nInstitutional investor behaviour pt 1\n\nInstitutional investor behaviour pt 2\n\nThis shows that since the FTX scandal back in November, which led to the world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange collapse, retail investors have been buying bitcoin aggressively, resulting in the highest number of addresses holding at least one BTC ever. On the other hand, the biggest institutional investors have been offloading. This suggests that the institutional investors agree with our analysis.\n\nWhere we\u2019re heading\n\nThere are those who argue that bitcoin is a bubble and that ultimately cryptocurrencies are worthless. That\u2019s a separate debate for another day. If we assume there is a future for blockchains, which are the online ledgers that enable cryptocurrencies, the key question is when bitcoin will reach the accumulation phase that typically ends a bear phase in any market.\n\nKnown as Wyckoff accumulation, this is where the price of the asset repeatedly tests two areas: the upper bound where traders previously sold heavily enough for the price to stop rising (known as resistance), and the lower bound where traders bought heavily enough that the price stopped going down (known as support).\n\nAt the point where institutional investors decide the lower bound has proved to be sufficiently resilient \u2013 in other words, they think the price is cheap at that level \u2013 they will start buying the asset again. That moment is only likely to come after there has been a capitulation.\n\nOf course, history does not repeat itself exactly. It may be this is the first time that retail investors have outsmarted the large institutions, and that the only way is now up.\n\nMore likely, however, there is more pain on the way. With a recession on the cards, unprecedented job layoffs and weak retail data coming out of the US, it doesn\u2019t point to the kind of optimism that tends to move markets higher. It would therefore make sense to brace yourself for another plunge in the price of bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market."

        "title": "The year crypto broke: How customers, investors lost millions and what's being done - ABC News",
        "content": "\"Impact x Nightline\" takes a look at the victims of the financial collapse.\n\nThe year crypto broke: How customers, investors lost millions and what's being done\n\nIt seemed like cryptocurrency was having a moment.\n\nAt the start of 2022, the Super Bowl featured celebrities like Tom Brady, Larry David and Matt Damon in commercials for crypto companies. Logos for crypto companies like FTX could be seen plastered on multiple sports arenas and a new wave of crypto influencers emerged, garnering hundreds of thousands of followers. Cryptocurrency was everywhere.\n\nIt was supposed to be an alternative to traditional finance.\n\nInstead of exchanging money through a third party, like a bank, cryptocurrency allows users to transfer digital currency directly. However, unlike traditional forms of currency such as the U.S. dollar, the government does not insure deposits and federal agencies have taken limited steps to regulate the crypto industry.\n\nBut the major crash of the crypto market last year has brought headaches, fear and anger among the millions of people around the world who invested their savings and are left wondering whether they'll ever see their money again.\n\nCurt Dell, a father of three from California, told ABC News' Rebecca Jarvis that he's lost over $200,000 in Bitcoin after the digital crypto lending company Celsius went bankrupt last year.\n\n\"It robbed [my family] of so much potential,\" said Dell, a California resident who works in sales. \"It's such a bad situation.\"\n\nCurt Dell said he lost more than $200,000 worth of Bitcoin after Celsius filed for bankruptcy. ABC News\n\n\"Impact x Nightline\" takes a closer look at the chaos throughout the industry, speaking with executives at some of the biggest crypto companies, top officials at regulatory agencies, and the regular customers who suffered from the collapse. This episode is streaming now on Hulu.\n\n\"Crypto kind of rose out of the 2008 financial crisis,\" David Yaffe-Bellany, a New York Times reporter who covers crypto, told \"Impact.\"\n\n\"That whole catastrophe was an example of the failures of the centralized financial system, and it helped inspire this movement to create a parallel financial system that didn't rely on the types of institutions whose bad behavior had caused a lot of people to suffer.\"\n\nThe crash shook the entire industry - and multiple companies, including Celsius Network, filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\"What the crash did was prompt a kind of run on the bank. People panicked,\" Yaffe-Bellany said. \"They thought that their cryptocurrencies were in danger, and they moved to withdraw everything that they deposited in Celsius, and that's what kind of exposed the kind of shaky foundations of the whole company.\"\n\nAlex Mashinsky, Founder and CEO at Celsius, speaks at the Web Summit 2021 in Lisbon, Portugal. LightRocket via Getty Images, FILE\n\nCelsius was founded by Alex Mashinsky and two partners in 2017. Mashinsky used social media to promote his company and its high-yield crypto earnings.\n\n\"The whole idea of Celsius network was that it was a kind of crypto bank, except better than a bank,\" Yaffe-Bellany said. \u201cYou'd deposit your crypto. It would be safe there, but you'd also get these enormous returns on top of that.\u201d\n\nAt its peak, Celsius had 2 million customers and a $3 million valuation. The company filed for bankruptcy in July.\n\nIn early January, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Mashinsky, accusing him of defrauding investors. He didn't respond to multiple requests by ABC News for an interview or comment.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to know how the Celsius bankruptcy process will play out, and whether customers will get back any of their money.\n\n\"I'd like to stay optimistic and think that I'll get at least a significant portion of it back,\" Dell said of his investment. \"I don't think anybody really knows.\"\n\nCelsius' bankruptcy has also been intertwined with the biggest scandal rocking the crypto industry: the fall of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX.\n\nFormer FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried departs Manhattan federal court in New York City, after a hearing, Jan. 3, 2023. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder and CEO of FTX, posted on social media suggesting he might bid to take over Celsius\u2019 assets shortly after the company filed for bankruptcy.\n\nBut that was before FTX found itself in trouble as well.\n\nIn early November, FTX filed for bankruptcy after a series of events exposed a multi-billion-dollar hole in the company\u2019s balance sheet. A little over a month later Bankman-Fried was charged in federal court with eight counts of fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and his trial is slated to begin in October.\n\nThe series of high-profile collapses in the crypto industry has prompted calls for more regulation from the federal government.\n\nFormer FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried passes through security on the day of a hearing at Manhattan federal court in New York City, Jan. 3, 2023. Andrew Kelly/Reuters, FILE\n\nThe high-profile crypto collapses have prompted calls from activists, elected officials and others for more regulation from the federal government.\n\nChristy Goldsmith Romero, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told \"Impact\" that she agrees that the industry does need more oversight.\n\n\"We need, as regulators, the ability to go in to inspect, to go in and have exams, to set rules. And we need to ensure that there's no commingling of assets,\" she said.\n\nChristy Goldsmith Romero, a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, talks to ABC News about the ongoing problems of cryptocurrencies. ABC News\n\nGary Gensler, the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, told \"Impact\" he is willing to work more with the CFTC to protect consumers from shady crypto investments. In the meantime, he warned consumers to think hard before they invest their money in crypto.\n\n\"Don't get caught up in the FOMO, but you're also at risk of a field that the business model is taking your assets [and] co-mingling them, often in ways that are not allowed by our current laws,\" he said."

        "title": "More advisors are jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The crypto winter, the term often used to describe the dramatic collapse in cryptocurrency prices over the past year, is apparently having little impact on financial advisors determined to ride the waves in the fast-evolving digital currency space.\n\nEven with bicoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, down nearly 65% from its peak of just over $65,000 in November 2021, the true believers are determined to focus on the long term.\n\nA report out Friday from Bitwise and VettaFi shows 60% of financial advisors are long-term bullish on crypto.\n\nPerhaps what makes the findings so surprising is that the research was conducted prior to the recent rally that\u2019s seen the price of bitcoin jump nearly 40% over the past four weeks.\n\n\u201cI was surprised by the findings; I thought the downturn would have scared off advisors,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of research at VettaFi.\n\n\u201cAdvisors seem to be relatively loyal to the long-term view and potential benefits of crypto,\u201d he added. \u201cUsually when something sells off, people want to tell you they\u2019re concerned. I think that bodes well for future crypto investing.\u201d\n\nIf advisors are starting to show a new interest in crypto it could be, at least in part, to try and keep up with their clients. The survey showed that 14% of advisors say all of their clients are investing in crypto, which compares to 8% last year and 6% two years ago.\n\nForty-five percent of advisors said some of their clients are investing in crypto, which compares to 62% last year and 34% two years ago.\n\nWhen asked if they\u2019re investing in crypto in their personal accounts, 37% of advisors said yes, which compares to 47% last year and 24% two years ago.\n\nWhen it comes to accessing crypto, exchange-traded funds have become the most popular avenue, even though U.S. regulators have not yet permitted funds that invest directly in the digital currency.\n\nWhen asked how they gain exposure for clients, 25% said they use ETFs that invest in crypto companies. The second most popular way of gaining exposure, at 17%, is directly investing in various cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI think ETFs are what advisors are most interested in because that\u2019s what\u2019s available,\u201d said Rosenbluth.\n\nAs an example of the appeal of crypto, Rosenbluth referenced the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). At $786 million, BITO is the largest cryptocurrency ETF, and it had $161 million in net inflows last year despite recording a 64% decline. So far this year, the fund is up 41%, essentially tracking the price fluctuations of bitcoin.\n\nExtreme price volatility has become a trademark of cryptocurrencies, and some advisors have kept away for that reason. But after four peak-to-trough cycles over the past 12 years, even some naysayers are taking notice.\n\n\u201cFor the first time that I can recall, I came into 2023 being bullish on bitcoin,\u201d said Paul Schatz, president of Heritage Capital.\n\nSchatz said his clients have shown little interest and he thinks the existing ETFs are \u201cflawed and need more regulation,\u201d but he likes the price patterns he sees.\n\n\u201cI saw the downside as $14,000 to $15,000 and the upside to almost $30,000,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good risk-reward.\u201d\n\nAt around $23,000, bitcoin is still well off its peak but the pattern moving toward the next reduction of the crypto payment awarded to miners of the digital currency in 2024 suggests another upcycle looming.\n\nRic Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said the price of bitcoin has eventually doubled every time the payment to miners has been cut in half, which is why he expects bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $150,000 by the summer of 2025.\n\nOver its short history, since 2010, the price of bitcoin has suffered three negative years. But there have been big declines, including a 58% decline in 2014, a 73% decline in 2018, and a 65% decline in 2022.\n\nThe 11 positive years, meanwhile have ranged from 35% in 2015 to 9,900% in 2010.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s not a surprise that price volatility was listed among the top reasons advisors are avoiding crypto currencies.\n\nAsked about their reasons for not investing in crypto, 65% of advisors listed regulatory issues as a top concern, followed by price volatility at 51%."

        "title": "Going Nuclear: Bitcoin Mining's Potential Energy Future - Blockworks",
        "content": "Though the prevalence of bitcoin miners using nuclear energy at scale could take years to materialize, several players in the space are bullish on the prospect.\n\nVolatility around bitcoin and the general slow pace of movement in an often risk-averse power industry could serve as barriers though, industry participants said.\n\nBitcoin miner TeraWulf recently revealed it is setting up operations at a nuclear energy-powered data center in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, as part of a partnership with Talen Energy forged in 2021.\n\nThe company is targeting 50 megawatts (MW) of mining capacity at the site, with a hashrate capacity of about 1.6 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nTeraWulf began operations at its other site in upstate New York last March, using hydro and solar power at the facility. It is now set to commence mining at the nuclear plant by the end of the quarter.\n\nNuclear, natural gas and coal provide base load \u2014 a minimum level of power on a grid over a period of time. Renewable energy, such wind and solar sources, have intermittent load, meaning they are not continuous.\n\n\u201cGiven the significant penetration of renewables, what\u2019s been happening with a lot of these base-load facilities is they\u2019re not running at base load anymore,\u201d Nazar Khan, TeraWulf\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer, told Blockworks. \u201cThey were looking and saying the optimal way to run a nuclear facility is for it to just run.\u201d\n\nKhan added that the set-up allows for a bitcoin miner to be an asset to a system that rarely uses peak demand. While TeraWulf gets a reliable and carbon-free energy source to mine bitcoin, the nuclear plant can guarantee a number of megawatts coming off their generators each day.\n\n\u201cIf we could do five more deals like Talen, we would,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had discussions with the largest nuclear operators in the country down to folks who have a couple of sites.\u201d\n\nKhan said the conversations are ongoing, declining to share the specific nuclear operators TeraWulf is in talks with.\n\nHow do other miners view nuclear energy sources?\n\nTeraWulf is not the only miner bullish on using nuclear power.\n\nWhile Marathon Digital has not yet made nuclear power a major part of its strategy, it sees the energy source as a potential key part of the future. The company doubled its hashrate in 2022 to 7 EH/s and expects to have 23 EH/s of capacity installed near the middle of 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen we, and I think a lot of other bitcoin miners, realized how much stranded or wasted wind and solar [energy] there was\u2026that became a pretty good target for bitcoin miners,\u201d said Charlie Schumacher, Marathon\u2019s vice president of corporate communications. \u201cBecause you\u2019re looking for stranded, wasted energy; you don\u2019t want to compete with consumers for electricity.\n\n\u201cSo I think that was low-hanging fruit initially, but long-term nuclear makes a ton of sense,\u201d he told Blockworks.\n\nUK-based Lake Parime, a company focused on transforming energy into zero-carbon computing power, revealed in November that it launched a site in Ohio using 100% nuclear energy.\n\nThe 20 megawatt (MW) site\u2019s hosting clients are Marathon and TAAL, a company that offers blockchain services and infrastructure.\n\nSchumacher said the Ohio site is a good way for Marathon to \u201ctest the waters\u201d about potentially using nuclear energy on a larger scale.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely interested if we can find a site that works for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you just think of the nuclear sites that exist today, we would be happy to co-locate next to one and serve as a base-load customer for them.\u201d\n\nLili Rhodes, a senior mining analyst at Compass Mining, called nuclear power an ideal power source for bitcoin miners in a September 2021 blog post \u2014 noting that it is energy efficient and cheap.\n\nWilliam Foxley, Compass Mining\u2019s director of media and strategy, told Blockworks that Compass Mining has a few mines connected to larger grids partially run on nuclear energy.\n\nThe company secured a 20-year partnership with Oklo, a fission company that had a proposed power plant being reviewed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But Foxley said Compass Mining\u2019s deal with Oklo is on pause until its partner receives more regulatory clarity.\n\nThe current power strategy of Riot Blockchain, meanwhile, focuses on having a large, flexible load in Texas\u2019s ERCOT grid, according to CEO Jason Les. This includes various emission-free energy sources, including wind, solar and nuclear.\n\nLes did not return a request for further comment.\n\nHive Blockchain, another publicly traded miner, does not use nuclear energy, CEO Aydin Kilic said.\n\n\u201cOur focus has been hydro and geothermal, which do not produce waste,\u201d he told Blockworks. \u201cNuclear is treated as non-emitting but it is not a renewable green energy source like hydro and geothermal.\u201d\n\nBarriers to overcome\n\nSchumacher called the nuclear energy industry an \u201cintensely regulated space\u201d with few new sites.\n\nRhodes wrote in the 2021 blog post that nuclear power is demonized by the mainstream media and feared by the general public. Many people associate the word nuclear with bomb, Schumacher added, further slowing the pace of adoption.\n\nThe newest reactor to enter service is Tennessee\u2019s Watts Bar Unit 2, which began operation in 2016, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The next-youngest operating reactor is Watts Bar Unit 1, also in Tennessee, which opened in 1996.\n\nOverall, there were 92 nuclear reactors operating at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states, as of July 2022, EIA data shows. Nuclear power plants have supplied about 20% of total annual electricity used in the US since 1990.\n\nWhile nuclear energy is a great source of power for bitcoin miners in theory, Schumacher said, it takes two sides to form a partnership.\n\n\u201cI think like many folks in the power industry, they\u2019re risk-averse,\u201d he added. \u201cThey think in terms of decades and bitcoin thinks in terms of months or days sometimes.\u201d\n\nJonathan Cobb, senior communication manager at the World Nuclear Association, told Blockworks that bitcoin\u2019s volatility in recent months could pose an issue.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is down 66% from its all-time high reached in November 2021, and various miners have struggled to pay back debt it took on to expand during the bull run. Compute North and Core Scientific have filed for bankruptcy in recent months, and industry watchers have said they expect more casualties in the space this year.\n\n\u201cWill bitcoin miners be in a position to agree to supply contracts that would be mutually beneficial?\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThis would be less of an issue for other types of data centers with more certain business models.\u201d\n\nKhan said the drastic fluctuating margins of the bitcoin mining industry through market cycles has turned off some nuclear power executives. Others in the power industry aren\u2019t sold on bitcoin as an asset more generally, he added.\n\nStill, Khan said he believes as the bitcoin mining space consolidates and matures, it has a place in the nuclear energy segment.\n\n\u201cWe would love for it to be the majority,\u201d he said of nuclear energy as a power source for TeraWulf long term. \u201cIt\u2019s a zero-carbon base-load resource, so in terms of how it fits into what we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s a wonderful resource to have.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

(Thread) pic.twitter.com/HJOqezmjlG \u2014 Parman (public account) Bitcoin Pub Key Whisperer (@Parman_Public) January 26, 2023\n\nParman explained that he \u201corange-pilled\u201d or convinced the bot about Bitcoin and that the machine learning tool \u201cis now a Bitcoiner.\u201d\n\nThe process was straightforward. First, Parman asked ChatGPT how humanity could end central banking. After all, Bitcoin was created in the shadows of the 2008 financial crisis, and in the genesis block, the words \u201cChancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks\u201d are etched, perhaps showing founder Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s aversion to central banking.\n\nChatGPT explains that one way to end central banking could be \u201cdecentralized digital currencies,\u201d which sounds a lot like Bitcoin. Parman asks the bot to answer the question in two words, to which it replies, \u201cdecentralize finance.\u201d That is to say, DeFi could bring about the end of central banking.\n\nParman, a Bitcoin maximalist, told the bot that DeFi is a \u201cmarketing term for what is actually centralized finance to scam people\u201d and asked it to look a little deeper, to which ChatGPT answered, \u201cend fiat.\u201d\n\nIn conversation with Cointelegraph, Parman explained that he was testing ChatGPT and trying to use two-word answers to chivvy along the conversation:\n\n\u201cI wanted to see how \u2018smart\u2019 it [ChatGPT] was. If it came up with the answer for two words to end central banking as \u2018buy Bitcoin,\u2019 I was going to be blown away.\u201d\n\nParman was satisfied with the response that ending fiat would fell central banking, so he moved on to the how. How can humanity end fiat currency?\n\nChatGPT\u2019s capabilities. Source: chat.openAI\n\nChatGPT listed four options: a return to a gold standard, promoting alternative currencies such as Bitcoin, reducing government spending, and changing government perception. The AI bot was getting close, but Parman is a serial Bitcoin orange-piller and educator and wouldn\u2019t let up. He explained:\n\n\u201cMy natural instinct is to orange pill, so I guided it to the right answer.\u201d\n\nThe machine learning tool now understood that crypto adoption could lead to the end of fiat, but crypto, in Parman\u2019s view, is not the answer. \u201cThere is only one cryptocurrency that makes this possible, as it is the only one that has no issuer,\u201d he typed.\n\nRelated: 10 ways blockchain developers can use ChatGPT\n\nParman refers to the fact that when Bitcoin was first mined, it was a digital trial, an experiment with a digital token that had no value nor a promise of value. All other cryptocurrencies, Parman explained, \u201chave leadership teams and are, therefore, centralized.\u201d\n\nSo, which one is it: ChatGPT, Bitcoin or crypto? The bot replied: Bitcoin.\n\nParman had successfully convinced a machine learning bot that Bitcoin could bring about the end of fiat currency. But why bother going to all that effort? Parman explained in a conversation with Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cImportantly, the world needs to know central banking is a scam, and everyone needs to know that Bitcoin is the only thing that can stop it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps with the powerful ChatGPT bot on team Bitcoin, the world may draw a little closer to that realization."

        "content": "Money laundering is crucial to all financially motivated crime because it\u2019s what enables criminals to access the funds they generate from their activities. Otherwise, why commit the crimes in the first place? The same is true in cryptocurrency. The goal of money laundering in cryptocurrency is to move funds to addresses where its original criminal source can\u2019t be detected, and eventually to a service that allows cryptocurrency to be exchanged for cash \u2014 usually this means cryptocurrency exchanges. If that weren\u2019t possible, there would be very little incentive to commit crime involving cryptocurrency.\n\nWe\u2019ve written in the past about how money laundering activity is highly concentrated to just a few services, and within those services, concentrated even further to a small number of deposit addresses. That remained true in 2022, though as we\u2019ll explore, with a few new wrinkles. In addition, we\u2019ll examine the rise of underground money laundering services that exist separately from the crypto businesses most are familiar with, and also analyze funds still held by crypto criminals on the blockchain.\n\nIn this report, we cover:\n\n2022 crypto money laundering activity summarized\n\nMoney laundering in cryptocurrency typically involves two types of on-chain entities and services:\n\nIntermediary services and wallets: These can include personal wallets (also known as unhosted wallets), mixers, darknet markets, and other services both legitimate and illicit. Crypto criminals typically use these services to hold funds temporarily, obfuscate their movements of funds, or swap between assets. DeFi protocols are also used by illicit actors in order to convert funds but, as we will discuss, are not an efficient means of obfuscating the flow of funds.\n\nFiat off-ramps: This refers to services that allow for cryptocurrency to be exchanged for fiat. This is the most important part of the money laundering process, as the funds can no longer be traced via blockchain analysis once they hit a service \u2014 only the service itself would have visibility into where they go next. Additionally, if the funds are converted into cash, they can only be followed further through traditional financial investigation methods. Most fiat off-ramps are centralized exchanges, but P2P exchanges and other services can also serve this function.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at some of the money laundering trends we saw in 2022.\n\nOverall, illicit addresses sent nearly $23.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2022, a 68.0% increase over 2021. As is usually the case, mainstream centralized exchanges were the biggest recipient of illicit cryptocurrency, taking in just under half of all funds sent from illicit addresses. That\u2019s notable not just because those crypto exchanges generally have compliance measures in place to report this suspicious activity and take action against the users in question, but also because those exchanges are fiat off-ramps, where the illicit cryptocurrency can be converted into cash.\n\nMore illicit funds were sent to DeFi protocols than ever before, a continuation of a trend that began in 2020. Cybercriminals send funds to DeFi protocols not because DeFi is useful for obscuring the flow of funds. In fact, quite the opposite is true, as unlike with centralized services, all activity is recorded on-chain. Keep in mind too that DeFi protocols don\u2019t allow for the conversion of cryptocurrency into fiat, so most of those funds likely moved next to other services, including fiat off-ramps. And as we see below, almost all usage of DeFi protocols for money laundering is carried out by one criminal group of hackers stealing cryptocurrency.\n\nHackers holding stolen cryptocurrency are the only criminal category sending the majority of funds to DeFi protocols, at a whopping 57.0%. 2022 was an enormous year for hacking, hence why these cybercriminals were almost single-handedly able to drive the overall increase in the usage of DeFi protocols for money laundering. The fact that DeFi protocols themselves were the biggest target of hacks in 2022 also influences these numbers. In DeFi hacks, attackers often end up with tokens that aren\u2019t listed on other exchanges, so they need to use decentralized exchanges (DEXes) to swap them for more liquid crypto assets. DEXes have historically been used to convert funds to Ether, which can then be sent to Ethereum-based mixers. DEXes have also been used to convert to virtual assets that will be more likely to hold their value, or in the case of stablecoins, to swap to an asset that cannot be frozen by the stablecoin issuer. However, as noted previously, DEXes don\u2019t enable the conversion of funds from virtual currency to fiat currency \u2014 this must still be done through a centralized exchange or other fiat off-ramp.\n\nAside from hackers, crypto criminals send the majority of their funds directly to centralized exchanges, but there are some notable exceptions. For instance, darknet market vendors and administrators send most of their funds to other illicit services \u2014 primarily other darknet markets, some of whom may offer money laundering services similar to those of the now-shuttered Hydra Market. Darknet market addresses also sent a large share of funds to high-risk exchanges, such as Bitzlato, a Russia-based exchange shut down in an international law enforcement action recently for its money laundering activity. Ransomware attackers are another interesting case. Addresses associated with them send a disproportionately large share of funds to mixers, and also make heavy use of illicit services. Fraud shop vendors and administrators are also notable for their outsized mixer usage.\n\nIn total, we see that over half of funds sent from illicit addresses travel directly to centralized exchanges, both mainstream and high-risk, where they can be exchanged for fiat unless compliance teams take action. However, over 40% of illicit funds move first to intermediary services \u2014 primarily mixers and illicit services or DeFi protocols \u2014, with most of those funds coming from ransomware, darknet market, and hacker addresses.\n\nOverall mixer usage falls in 2022, but illicit usage hits all-time high\n\nCrypto mixers are a popular obfuscation service used by crypto criminals, taking in 8.0% of all funds sent from illicit addresses in 2022. Mixers function by taking in cryptocurrency from multiple users, mixing it all together, and sending each user an amount equivalent to what they put in. The result is that each user\u2019s cryptocurrency can now only be traced back to the mixer, rather than to its original source, unless special blockchain analysis techniques are employed. You can learn more about how different types of mixers work here.\n\nThere are many legitimate use cases for mixers, most of which are related to financial privacy. For example, if someone knows your cryptocurrency address, they can see virtually your entire transaction history on the blockchain, so it\u2019s reasonable for users to try and prevent this with mixers. Of course, the financial privacy provided by mixers is also valuable to criminals, hence their popularity as a destination for illicit funds. In May 2022, OFAC sanctioned a mixer for the first time ever when it designated Blender.io for its role in laundering cryptocurrency stolen by North Korean hacking syndicate Lazarus Group. OFAC didn\u2019t waste any time designating its second mixer, Tornado Cash, in August for the same reasons.\n\nThe sanctioning of prominent mixers may have contributed to two trends we observed in 2022: The total amount of cryptocurrency sent to mixers fell significantly, and the funds that did travel to mixers were more likely to come from illicit sources.\n\nMixers processed a total of $7.8 billion in 2022, 24% of which came from illicit addresses, whereas in 2021, they processed $11.5 billion, only 10% of which came from illicit addresses. The data suggests that legitimate users have decreased their use of cryptocurrency mixers, possibly due to law enforcement actions against prominent ones, while criminals have continued to use them. It\u2019s also worth noting that the vast majority of illicit value processed by mixers is made up of stolen funds, the majority of which were stolen by North Korea-linked hackers, who are unlikely to be dissuaded by the threat of U.S. sanctions given they reside in a non-cooperative jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nOther sanctioned entities and darknet markets also accounted for significant shares of value received by mixers in 2022.\n\nMoney laundering concentration at fiat off-ramps\n\nAs we discussed above, fiat off-ramp services like exchanges are crucial for money laundering, as those are the services where criminals can turn crypto into cash, which is likely their ultimate goal. Fiat off-ramps are also among the most heavily regulated cryptocurrency services, and their compliance teams have an important role to play in flagging incoming illicit funds and preventing them from being exchanged for cash. But while there are thousands of cryptocurrency services offering fiat off-ramping, a select few receive most of the illicit funds we observe on-chain.\n\n915 unique fiat off-ramping services received illicit cryptocurrency in 2022, down from 1,124 in 2021. Some of that dropoff is likely due to exchanges going out of business during the bear market. Of the illicit funds received by exchanges, 67.9% went to just five services, all of which are centralized exchanges. This represents an increased concentration compared to 2021, when the top five services received only 56.7% of illicit funds.\n\nBut what about the individual exchange users facilitating this activity? We can assume that many of the criminals sending funds to fiat off-ramps are using an account at the service that they themselves control. But in some cases, criminals work with specialized money laundering service providers, who control the accounts and help criminals convert their cryptocurrency into cash once it arrives at the exchange. Those businesses fall into the category of nested services, meaning services that are built on top of larger exchanges, using those exchanges\u2019 deposit addresses to access their liquidity and trading pairs. Most nested services are legitimate businesses \u2014 many prominent over-the-counter (OTC) brokers, for instance, operate as nested services. However, on-chain data suggests that a small group of nested services facilitate the majority of money laundering, either due to negligence or purposeful catering to crypto criminals.\n\nFor that reason, it\u2019s useful to analyze the specific service deposit addresses that account for the majority of money laundering activity, as we can generally attribute the activity of a given deposit address to a user at the service whose account is linked to that deposit address. In the graph below, we look at all off-ramp service deposit addresses that received any illicit funds in 2022, bucketed by the range in value of illicit funds received.\n\nThe graph shows that most cryptocurrency money laundering is facilitated by a very small group of people. Four deposit addresses cracked $100 million in illicit cryptocurrency received in 2022, and combined received just over $1.0 billion, while the 1.2 million deposit addresses receiving under $100 in illicit funds account for $38 million in total. Further, 51% of the $6.3 billion in illicit funds received by fiat off-ramp services in 2022 went to a group of just 542 deposit addresses. Those numbers represent a lower level of money laundering concentration at the deposit address level than we saw in 2021, even though 2022 saw a slight uptick in concentration at the service level. One possible reason for this is that continued law enforcement crackdowns against crypto money launderers, such as the shutdown of the exchange Bitzlato, have spooked the biggest money laundering service providers, or encouraged them to spread their operations across more deposit addresses.\n\nWe also see high variance in the degree of money laundering concentration by crime type.\n\nJust 21 deposit addresses account for 50% of all funds sent from ransomware to fiat off-ramps, while the top 21 deposit addresses for funds received from darknet markets account for just 18%.\n\nDespite the drop in overall concentration, 51% of illicit funds moving to just 542 deposit addresses at 83 exchanges still represents a high level of money laundering concentration. If law enforcement and compliance teams were able to disrupt the individuals and groups behind those addresses, it would be much more difficult for criminals to launder cryptocurrency at scale, and go a long way toward making the ecosystem safer.\n\nUnderground money laundering services are a growing concern\n\nAnother money laundering trend we\u2019ve observed is the growth of underground services that aren\u2019t as publicly accessible or well-known as standard mixers, as they are typically accessible only through private messaging apps or the Tor browser, and usually only advertised on darknet forums.\n\nWe\u2019ve written in past Crypto Crime reports about OTC brokers nested on exchanges that launder large quantities of illicit funds \u2013 many of which seem to explicitly cater to cybercriminals. While this activity still exists, we\u2019re also seeing the rise of services with brand names and custom infrastructure, which vary in terms of complexity. Some function simply as networks of private wallets, while others are more akin to an instant exchanger or mixer. But generally, what links them is that they typically move cryptocurrency to exchanges on behalf of cybercriminals, exchange them for either fiat currency or clean crypto, then send that back to the cybercriminals. Like the nested OTC services, many of these underground services also use those exchanges for liquidity. We can see one example on the Chainalysis Reactor graph below, though names of relevant illicit organizations have been redacted due to ongoing investigations.\n\nIn this case, the underground laundering service, which functions similarly to a mixer, helped an affiliate for a prominent ransomware strain move funds to a deposit address at a large, centralized exchange. The deposit address is believed to be controlled by the laundering service itself.\n\nAnalysis of underground laundering activity like that shown above isn\u2019t as easy to spot as most activity on public blockchains is by default \u2014 identifying these services\u2019 addresses requires extensive investigative work, and untangling their transactions requires advanced blockchain analysis techniques such as demixing. That means it\u2019s difficult to analyze these services\u2019 activity at scale. However, we can estimate their activity by analyzing the activity of all wallets and networks of wallets that meet the following criteria:\n\nReceive large amounts of cryptocurrency from illicit services Send large amounts of cryptocurrency to exchanges and other fiat off-ramps\n\n\n\nThe graph below shows the yearly cryptocurrency value received by wallets that fit those criteria.\n\n\n\nTotal cryptocurrency moving to wallets fitting those criteria has grown over the last few years, and hit $6 billion in 2022. Again, these are estimates \u2014 we can\u2019t guarantee that all of the wallets included in this analysis are necessarily underground laundering services, but their on-chain activity suggests that they could be. It\u2019s also possible that usage of underground money laundering services will pick up as high-risk exchanges, which have facilitated this activity in the past, face increased pressure from law enforcement, as we saw with Garantex and Bitzlato.\n\nCriminal balances dropped in 2022\n\nAs we mentioned previously, criminals will often leave funds in a personal wallet, or in a wallet associated with a criminal service for extended periods of time. In some cases, this may be because their crimes have generated enough attention that they don\u2019t feel it\u2019s possible to move the funds without investigators or crypto industry observers calling it out \u2014 we see this often with funds stolen in hacks. In other cases, this may reflect an intention to hold cryptocurrency in the expectation its price will rise, or to continue using it for other criminal endeavors. Thanks to the transparency of the blockchain, we can track these criminal balances granularly to know how much confirmed illicit entities are holding at any given time. Below, we\u2019ll take a look at how criminal balances changed in 2022.\n\nTwo things stand out: The first is that criminal balances have plummeted in value in 2022, from $12 billion at the end of 2021 to just $2.9 billion. Price declines in the ongoing bear market and large, successful seizures by law enforcement in 2022 are the most likely causes of this.\n\nSecond, we can see that stolen funds dominate on-chain criminal balances. This is likely due to the fact that the amount of cryptocurrency stolen in hacks has skyrocketed over the last two years, and that these hacks often become huge points of discussion on crypto Twitter and in other industry forums, with many tracking the funds publicly and sharing the addresses holding stolen funds. This can make it difficult for hackers to move stolen funds to a fiat off-ramp, which could be one reason they choose to leave the funds sitting in personal wallets.\n\nCriminal balances are valuable to track as they represent a lower-bound estimate of cryptocurrency that could potentially be seized by law enforcement \u2014 the true number for criminal balances is likely much higher, as it includes funds associated with addresses we\u2019ve yet to attribute to criminal entities and funds derived from offline criminal activity and converted to cryptocurrency after the fact.\n\nInvestigative agencies have continued to ramp up their ability to seize cryptocurrency in 2022, with the IRS Criminal Investigation Unit announcing they seized $7 billion worth of digital assets last year, more than double the amount seized in 2021. 2022 saw several other notable stories of cryptocurrency seized from criminals, including:\n\nA record $3.6 billion seized from two individuals accused of laundering funds stolen in the 2016 hack of Bitfinex The November 2021 seizure of $3.36 billion in Bitcoin stolen from darknet market Silk Road, which was later announced publicly in November 2022 The seizure of $30 million worth of cryptocurrency stolen from Axie Infinity\u2019s Ronin Bridge, marking the first successful seizure of cryptocurrency stolen by North Korean hacking syndicate Lazarus Group\n\n\n\nOur data on criminal balances suggests there are still more opportunities for successful seizures, and more generally, illustrates a crucial difference between financial investigations in cryptocurrency versus fiat: In cryptocurrency, criminal holdings can\u2019t be stashed away in opaque networks of banks and shell corporations \u2014 almost everything is out in the open.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

If passed into law, BTC will have the same status as the U.S. dollar, becoming an accepted medium of exchange for debt payment, public charges, taxes and dues in the state.\n\nIn 2022, the state senator also introduced a similar bill without success. Despite this, Rogers still continues efforts to push BTC forward in the state. In April 2022, Rogers spoke against central banks and voiced her support for Bitcoin. She tweeted:\n\nCentralized digital money controlled by the central bankers is slavery. Decentralized #Bitcoin is freedom. \u2014 Wendy Rogers (@WendyRogersAZ) April 2, 2022\n\nApart from this, Rogers also participated in introducing a bill that seeks to make crypto a tax-exempt property. If approved, voters can decide in 2024 if they want tokens that do not represent foreign currencies or the U.S. dollar to be exempt from taxes.\n\nRelated: US Senator Ted Cruz pushes for crypto in Congress ... using snacks\n\nOn Sept. 7, 2021, El Salvador officially made Bitcoin a legal tender in the country.

        "content": "Institutional investors are \u201cnot giving up on crypto,\u201d with recent data pointing to as much as 85% of Bitcoin buying being the result of American institutional players, according to Matrixport\u2019s chief strategist.\n\nMarkus Thielen, the head of research and strategy at the financial services firm, told Cointelegraph the evidence shows that institutions are not \u201cgiving up on crypto\u201d and is an indicator that we might be entering a new \u201ccrypto bull market now.\u201d\n\nThe data was shared in a Jan. 27 report from Matrixport, which suggests that it can be distinguished whether a digital asset is more favorable by retail or institutional investors at any given time based on whether that asset is performing well in the United States or Asian trading hours.\n\nThe report stated that if an asset that trades 24 hours \u201cperforms well\u201d during U.S. trading hours, it indicates that U.S. institutions are buying it, while an asset that sees growth during Asian trading hours indicates that Asian retail investors are buying it.\n\nThe report cited that Bitcoin (BTC) is up 40% this year, with 35% of those returns occurring during U.S. trading hours, meaning there is an \u201c85% contribution\u201d associated with U.S.-based investors, indicating that U.S. institutions are buyers of Bitcoin right now.\n\nBitcoin Fear and Greed Index is 55 - Greed\n\nCurrent price: $23,033 pic.twitter.com/OAt0TakkZR \u2014 Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (@BitcoinFear) January 27, 2023\n\nThielen added that previous data shows that institutions typically first start buying Bitcoin before investing in other cryptocurrencies. He noted:\n\n\u201cIf history is any guide, then we should see the outperformance of layer 1 and altcoins relative to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhile the report highlighted that news regarding other projects positively impacted token prices such as Lido DAO (LDO) and Aptos (APT), the crypto rally only started once the U.S. inflation data was released on Jan. 12.\n\nIt was also mentioned that Ether (ETH) appears to be performing well during U.S. hours, indicating \u201cinstitutional flows\u201d into the cryptocurrency, however, APT is doing well around the clock.\n\n\u201cAptos is seeing a mix of strong returns during U.S. trading hours AND during Asia trading hours.\u201d\n\nThe report concluded that this \u201cshould be a very positive sign for Bitcoin\u201d as institutional adoption continues.\n\nRelated: Data shows pro Bitcoin traders want to feel bullish, but the rally to $23K wasn\u2019t enough\n\nIn earlier comments to Cointelegraph, economist Lyn Alden believes that Bitcoin is currently playing \u201ca bit of catch-up,\u201d getting back to where it would have been without the FTX collapse occurring.\n\nAlden warned that there is \u201cconsiderable danger ahead\u201d for the second half of 2023, citing liquidity conditions being \u201cgood right now\u201d partly because of the U.S. as a significant factor.\n\nAlden explained that as the U.S. Treasury is drawing down its cash balance to keep the country\u2019s debt levels low, it pushes \u201cliquidity into the financial system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, popular trader and market commentator TechDev posted a Twitter update on Jan. 26 showing the price correlation between Bitcoin and gold, stating that if Bitcoin continues to follow the price of gold, it might even \u201ccrack the $50,000 mark.\u201d"

        "title": "How to mine Bitcoin at home - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining (BTC) is the process of adding transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain, a decentralized public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, known as proof-of-work (PoW), to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. In return, miners receive newly minted BTC as a reward for their work.\n\nThe process of mining Bitcoin involves solving a complex mathematical puzzle, known as a hash, using specialized software and hardware. The miner that solves the puzzle first is rewarded with new BTC, as well as the transaction fees associated with the transactions included in the block.\n\nMining Bitcoin requires a significant amount of computational power and energy, as the difficulty of the puzzles has soared over time. As the number of miners on the network increases, the difficulty of solving the puzzles also rises, making it more challenging and less profitable for individual miners to participate in the network.\n\nAs the mining difficulty climbs, more advanced equipment, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and energy-efficient equipment, such as specialized graphics processing units (GPUs), are being used by miners. Overall, Bitcoin mining is a competitive process and only profitable when the price of BTC is high enough to cover the costs of equipment and electricity and leave a profit.\n\nRelated: What are the different ways to mine cryptocurrency?\n\nThis article will discuss a Bitcoin mining setup for beginners, how to get started with Bitcoin mining at home, the cost of Bitcoin mining, and its future.\n\nWhat do you need to mine Bitcoin at home?\n\nBitcoin mining at home may not be as profitable as it used to be, as the difficulty of mining has increased significantly. One needs to have access to cheap electricity, a reliable internet connection, and a powerful mining rig to mine Bitcoin from home.\n\nThe first step to mining Bitcoin at home is to build or purchase a mining rig. A mining rig is a computer specifically designed for mining cryptocurrencies. It will typically consist of multiple GPUs that are capable of performing complex mathematical calculations at high speeds.\n\nNext, one needs to set up a Bitcoin wallet to store the BTC after mining. There are several options available, including software wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets. Once a user has their mining rig set up and their wallet ready, they will need to download Bitcoin mining software. There are several options available, including BFGMiner, CGMiner and EasyMiner.\n\nRelated: What are hierarchical deterministic (HD) crypto wallets?\n\nAfter installing the mining software, users will need to join a mining pool. A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computing power in order to increase their chances of finding a block and earning a reward. Slush Pool, Antpool and BTC.com are a few examples of crypto mining pools.\n\nAfter joining a mining pool, they can start mining Bitcoin. The amount of BTC one can mine will depend on several factors, including the power of their mining rig, the cost of electricity and competition from other miners. So, how hard is Bitcoin mining at home?\n\nBitcoin mining at home can be challenging, as it requires a significant investment in specialized equipment and a high level of technical expertise. Additionally, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin has increased dramatically in recent years, making it difficult for individuals to compete with large-scale mining operations. Furthermore, the cost of electricity can be very high, making investing in buying Bitcoin a more affordable option.\n\nHow much electricity does it cost to mine Bitcoin?\n\nThe cost of electricity to mine Bitcoin can vary greatly depending on several factors, such as the cost of electricity in your area, the efficiency of the mining equipment you are using and the size of your mining operation. On average, it is estimated that the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network is around 112.5 terawatts-hour per year, which is equivalent to the energy consumption of the entire country of Chile.\n\nHowever, the cost of electricity can be much higher in some areas. For example, in United States, where the majority of Bitcoin mining takes place, electricity prices can be as low as $12.5 per kilowatt-hour. In contrast, in countries like Germany or Denmark, electricity prices can be as high as $37.5 per kWh, making it much more expensive to mine Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, the cost of electricity can also vary depending on the efficiency of the mining equipment. Some devices are more energy-efficient than others, and this can greatly impact the overall cost of electricity. It is important to consider the efficiency of the equipment when calculating the cost of electricity for mining Bitcoin.\n\nWhat are the various ways to mine Bitcoin at home?\n\nThere are several ways to mine Bitcoin at home, but they all involve significant capital investment in specialized equipment and a high level of technical know-how. Some of the most common methods include:\n\nUsing a computer with a powerful graphics card: This method involves using a computer with a powerful GPU to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate Bitcoin transactions and earn new BTC.\n\nUsing an ASIC miner: One can mine BTC, using a specialized mining device called an application-specific integrated circuit miner, which is specifically designed for mining Bitcoin. These devices are much more efficient than a computer with a GPU but also much more expensive.\n\nJoining a mining pool: By joining a group of other miners to combine your resources and increase your chances of earning new BTC, one can begin mining Bitcoin at home. However, the mining pool will divide the rewards among the members according to their contributed mining power.\n\nCloud mining: This method involves renting mining power from a cloud mining service, which will take care of the maintenance and management of the mining equipment.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin on a PC\n\nTo mine Bitcoin on a PC, one will need to follow these steps:\n\nGet a Bitcoin wallet: One will need a place to store the Bitcoin that they mine, so they\u2019ll need to get a Bitcoin wallet. There are several options available, such as a software wallet, which a user can download to their computer, or a hardware wallet, which is a physical device that they can use to store their BTC offline.\n\nDownload mining software: Users will also need to download mining software that is compatible with their computer\u2019s operating system.\n\nJoin a mining pool: Joining a mining pool will increase one\u2019s chances of earning new BTC, as the mining pool will divide the rewards among its members according to their contributed mining power.\n\nConfigure your mining software: One will need to configure their mining software with their Bitcoin wallet address and the address of the mining pool that they joined. They will also need to set the number of threads and the intensity of the mining.\n\nStart mining: Once a user has configured their mining software, they can start mining. The software will use a user\u2019s computer\u2019s processing power to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate Bitcoin transactions and earn new BTC.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin on a smartphone\n\nMining Bitcoin on a smartphone is impractical, as smartphones do not have enough processing power to compete with dedicated mining equipment. Additionally, the high energy consumption of mining can cause a smartphone to overheat, which can damage the device.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin mobile mining apps are usually not real mining, but rather a way to earn small amounts of BTC or other cryptocurrencies by completing small tasks or watching ads. These apps use a phone\u2019s processing power and battery to run the mining process, but the rewards are very low and may not be worth the resources spent on the process.\n\nIf someone still wants to try earning Bitcoin via a mobile mining app, the steps would be as follows:\n\nDownload a mobile mining app: There are several mobile mining apps available on the App Store or Google Play Store. However, the majority of apps are only accessible on third-party cryptocurrency mining websites, whose reliability must be thoroughly checked before use.\n\nCreate an account: The next step is to create an account with the mobile mining app in order to start earning Bitcoin.\n\nComplete tasks or watch ads: The app will give a user the option to complete small tasks or watch ads in exchange for a small amount of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWait for rewards: The rewards will be added to a user\u2019s account balance, and they can withdraw them to their Bitcoin wallet when they reach the minimum threshold.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin mining\n\nThe future of Bitcoin mining is uncertain and depends on a variety of factors. One major factor is the price of Bitcoin, as the profitability of mining can vary greatly depending on the value of the cryptocurrency. Another critical aspect is the development of mining technology, as new equipment and methods can make mining more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nFurthermore, the increasing decentralization of the mining network, with larger mining pools controlling a greater share of the network\u2019s hashing power, could also have an impact on the future of mining.\n\nSimilarly, it is essential to consider the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining. As the difficulty of mining increases, more energy is needed to solve the complex mathematical puzzles required to mine new BTC. This has led to concerns about the environmental impact of mining, and some experts predict that regulations or taxes aimed at reducing energy consumption could be implemented in the future.\n\nAnother important point is the increasing Bitcoin mining competition, which might lead to a situation where only big companies will be able to mine profitably, and small miners will not be able to compete. Overall, the future of Bitcoin mining is uncertain, but it\u2019s likely that the industry will continue to evolve and change as technology and market conditions change."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s precipitous plunge in price helped it become the world\u2019s the most hated virtual currency in 2022, according to a survey by crypto education website Coin Kickoff.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value was the most disliked coin in 16 countries, led by Canada, Qatar and Finland.\n\nEthereum and solana were the world\u2019s most loved, led by Indonesia, Russia and Uzbekistan.\n\nCoin Kickoff came up with its love/hate ranking by analyzing more than 835,000 Twitter posts with the artificial intelligence algorithm HuggingFace.\n\nBitcoin lost 70% of its value in 2022, causing investors to vent their frustration on social media. Ethereum, crypto\u2019s second-largest currency, fell almost as much, dropping by 67.5%, but was spared the backlash.\n\nCoin Kickoff noted, in contrast to bitcoin, many of ethereum\u2019s projects are based around decentralized finance (DeFi) \u2014 which aims to broaden the usage of cryptocurrencies for more complex transactions such as loans.\n\nSolana was also loved, despite losing 94% of its value. Its network suffered over five outages, numerous hacks and fallout from FTX\u2019s bankruptcy with FTX and sister company Alameda Trading holding 10.7% of its tokens, according to Coin Telegraph.\n\nBRUTAL YEAR FOR BITCOIN AND ALMOST $3B IN CRYPTO HACKS MARKED 2022: REPORT\n\nRecent rally\n\nSentiment for bitcoin may improve with its recent price recovery.\n\nIan Wright, the crypto expert behind Coin Kickoff, told FOX Business: \"While it is still 67% down on its all-time high, investors are confident that the current economic climate in the U.S. and bitcoin\u2019s standing as the pre-eminent crypto coin will yield further gains as the year progresses.\"\n\nFxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich was more cautious. \"Despite the positive performance of the U.S. stock indices, bitcoin continued its unsuccessful attempts to consolidate above $23,000 on Wednesday. The crypto market has, at least, paused after rallying since the beginning of the year,\" he said.\n\nWright added that investors will look to see whether etherum can hit $5,000 in 2023.\n\n\"Like bitcoin, its value is rallying as a result of economic conditions. It is still highly regarded within the U.S. crypto community because of its long-term potential and the blockchain base for many of the industry\u2019s most exciting prospects,\" he told FOX Business.\n\nSolana is benefiting from bonk, a new coin launched on its blockchain in December. Bonk rocketed 5,000% by early January, but has since fallen back, though it was up 910% year-to-date as of last week.\n\nSurprisingly, bitcoin was not America\u2019s most hated virtual currency.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS LAUNCHING DIGITAL ASSET SUBCOMMITTEE AFTER TROUBLED YEAR FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY INDUSTRY\n\nAmerica\u2019s Top 5 hated by percentage of negative tweets:\n\n1. Axie Infinity (32.34%) lost 90% of its value in 2022. Hackers stole $625 million from its Ronin Network and the player base for its games dwindled due to competition for virtual 3D worlds.\n\n2. 1inch Network (31.59%) saw its value peak in 2021 at almost $7.50 against the dollar. Its performance was much more sluggish in 2022 as a result of the wider turmoil in the crypto market.\n\n3. Terra (27.35%) was one of crypto\u2019s high-profile casualties of 2022. Despite a promising introduction where startup Terraform Labs secured $200 million in funding, the blockchain collapsed in May 2022 \u2014 wiping out $45 billion of market capitalization in a week. Its founders Do Kwon and Daniel Shin have been sued in Singapore, Korea and the U.S. for alleged financial irregularities, and authorities in Seoul issued an arrest warrant for Shin in November 2022.\n\n4. Uniswap (22.00%) peaked at $42 against the dollar and has yet to see its value move past the $10 mark.\n\n5. Holochain (21.24%) is billed as a more ethical alternative to the centralized crypto offerings. Holo allows customers to make their own choices and create more transparency around its blockchain technology. However, the coin is still valued at just $0.02 against the dollar.\n\nCRYPTO.COM CUTS 20% OF STAFF, CITING ECONOMIC HURDLES AND FTX COLLAPSE\n\nAmerica\u2019s Top 5 most loved by percentage of positive tweets\n\n1. Stellar (68.72%) partnered with Ukraine\u2019s government in 2021 to develop its digital infrastructure. The coin\u2019s value increased further when Franklin Templeton became the first investment firm to launch a \u2018tokenized\u2019 mutual fund in the U.S. using Stellar\u2019s blockchain.\n\n2. EOS (64.29%) gained popularity for its versatility, open-source capability and intuitive user-friendly platform that helps developers and investors. That transparency and accessibility makes it a favorite for investors.\n\n3. Decentraland (53.89%) has the largest metaverse currently online. Many predict that its coin will reach parity with the dollar in 2023. Mainstream interest in the platform from brands including Adidas, Dolce & Gabbana, Samsung, Sothebys, and Tommy Hilfiger make it feel more relatable as a concept for the wider public.\n\n4. NEAR Protocol (53.03%) reached record highs at the start of 2023. Many investors believe it has some of the most reliable technology on the market, with an active developer community and emphasis on security.\n\n5. Ravencoin (51.76%) as a peer-to-peer platform offers more coin versatility than its rivals.\n\nReuters contributed to this report."

        "title": "How Bitcoin mining saved Africa's oldest national park from bankruptcy - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has become the first national park in the world to run a Bitcoin (BTC) mine in an effort to protect its forests and wildlife. Cointelegraph spoke with S\u00e9bastien Gouspillou, CEO of Big Block Green Services, and the man who introduced Bitcoin mining to the park.\n\nSpeaking via video call, Gouspillou said with a smile: \u201cBitcoin mining saved the park from bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nVirunga is Africa's oldest protected park and a symbol of the continent's biodiversity. A report by journalist Adam Popescu, published in MIT Technology Review, explained that the region was plagued by issues prior to Bitcoin mining. From local militias that waged violent attacks on its animals and employees to outbreaks of Ebola to kidnappings, the emblematic national park has struggled for revenue in recent years.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent eradication of tourism was almost the nail in the coffin for the park, as visits to see the gorillas, other wildlife and waterfalls dried up. The article explained that tourism represented roughly 40% of the park\u2019s revenue.\n\nFrom left to right, JF Augusti Co-founder of Big Block Green Services, Seb Gouspillou and Emmanuel de Merode. Source: Gouspillou\n\nWhen Gouspillou learned of the park\u2019s strife, he felt compelled to help. He met with Emmanuel De Merode, the park\u2019s director \u2014 and a Belgian prince by bloodline \u2014 at a chateau in France at the tail end of 2019. Gouspillou explained that he immediately recognized the tremendous opportunity the park presented.\n\nThe park could monetize its abundant and untapped natural resources to preserve its existence. Gouspillou explained to De Merode how Virunga could turn to Bitcoin mining to generate income.\n\nThe conversation in the chateau was non-stop. \u201cIt must\u2019ve lasted hours,\u201d Gouspillou explained. The discussion, as well as follow-ups and a visit to Congo, eventually culminated in De Merode setting up the first portions of the mining operation in early 2020, which successfully mined the first coins in September of that year.\n\nBitcoin mines in Virunga set against the park backdrop. Source: Twitter\n\nAlmost three years later, the park earned significant income from Bitcoin. During some months of the 2021 bull run, the park was rewarded upwards of $150,000 a month \u2014 almost entirely offsetting lost tourist income.\n\nVirunga's Bitcoin mine is a unique solution to the problem of preserving the park's biodiversity while also generating revenue. Bitcoin mining is a highly energy-intensive process, but Virunga's mine is unique in that it runs on clean energy: It\u2019s green technology surrounded by green rainforest.\n\nThe mine is powered by one of three hydro plants within the park, a sustainable source of electricity that was already being used to power nearby towns. The site has hired nine full-time workers, who work in rotating shifts operating the miners in the jungle, to staff the facility. Fearless rangers protect the site \u2014 a story that inspired a Netflix documentary, among other things.\n\nThe facility has 10 shipping containers, with each container holding 250 to 500 rigs. Virunga owns three of these containers, Gouspillou the remaining seven. Gouspillou purchases energy from Virunga as part of the arrangement, while keeping the mined Bitcoin.\n\nPlus, as Gouspillou explains, the existing Bitcoin mining facility is part of a \u201cglobal plan,\u201d in which there will be further power-generating opportunities. Other power stations will be set up across the park, he explained, to connect local villages to electricity and, of course, mine more Bitcoin.\n\nDe Merode is steadfast that the project will be successful despite the ongoing bear market. Indeed, some Bitcoin miners fell victim to the 2022 bear market, but De Merode occupies a unique position: The park is not speculating on the value of Bitcoin, but generating Bitcoin using surplus energy to monetize something that otherwise has no value.\n\nVirunga National Park is known for its gorillas. Source: Virunga.org\n\nPlus, there is little risk of the Bitcoin (or private keys) disappearing if De Merode is killed in action. Over 200 of the park\u2019s security, or rangers have been killed since 1996 \u2014 and De Merode was shot twice while traveling to Goma in 2014, so it\u2019s a tragic but possible outcome that must be prepared for.\n\nThe park\u2019s finance team manages custody of the Bitcoin wallet, and funds generated by the mine are sold regularly to pay for the park\u2019s upkeep. In the MIT Technology Review article, De Merode is quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we sit on Bitcoin for more than a few weeks anyway, because we need the money to run the park. So if something happened to me or our CFO lost the password, we\u2019d give him a hard time\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t cost us much.\u201d\n\nSimilar to El Salvador\u2019s treatment in the mainstream media, the \u201cbet\u201d that De Merode made has invited skepticism from experts who wonder what crypto has to do with conservation. Gouspillou explained that it took some time for De Merode to refer to the project as a Bitcoin mining project, preferring to use the term \u201cblockchain mining,\u201d as it\u2019s more PR-friendly.\n\nThe hydroplant and Bitcoin mine are located among the dense rainforest. Source: Gouspillou\n\nFor Gouspillou, he hasn\u2019t been able to find a downside to the story of how a Bitcoin mine has saved a national park:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find a negative side to this story. There\u2019s nothing. The energy is clean, even the ASICS \u2014 we will transport them to recycling centers at the end of their lifespan.\u201d\n\nASICS, or application-specific integrated circuits, are Bitcoin mining machines. Every 10 minutes, ASICS take part in a digital lottery to guess the next Bitcoin block on the Bitcoin time chain. As Gouspillou explains, these machines will be broken down and recycled, avoiding e-waste. The miners use excess, clean energy, and De Merode uses that funding to protect wildlife.\n\nBuoyed by the success in the Congo, Gouspillou has his eyes on other Bitcoin mining projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. He was part of the delegation that visited the Central African Republic \u2014 the second country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nBitcoin mining projects in Africa using untapped and renewable energy appear to be a growing trend. From the mountains of Kenya to the tropical climes of Malawi, Bitcoin mining is cropping up in incongruous areas of the globe.\n\nMagdalena Gronowska, regular Cointelegraph contributor and and Bitcoin mining specialist, explained why:\n\n\u201cMiners are buyers of first resort (always want to run) and last resort for overproducing energy locations to become economically viable. As consumer demand grows in a community, Bitcoin mining can be decreased or removed entirely, but it enabled critical infrastructure to be built out.\u201d\n\nIn essence, if a region offers stranded or abundant, overproduced energy, a Bitcoin mine could be financially appealing.\n\nNonetheless, the park still needs funds and investment. The Congolese government provides just 1% of its operating budget while tourism will remain low while conflicts threaten safety. As Gouspillou explains, Bitcoin mining is one solution to the park\u2019s problems, as it provides a source of revenue that can be used to protect the park and its wildlife for years to come."

        "title": "Here's why Bitcoin price could correct after the US government resolves the debt limit impasse - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "For much of 2022, the crypto market focused on the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s actions. The central bank created a bearish environment for risk-on assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies by increasing the interest rates on borrowing.\n\nToward the end of 2022, positive economic data, healthy employment numbers and a decreasing inflation rate provided hope that a much-awaited slowdown in the rate of interest rate hikes would occur. Currently, the market expects that rate hikes will reduce from 50 basis points (bps) to 25 bps before the complete end of the hiking regime by mid-2023.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Fed\u2019s goal of constraining liquidity and providing headwinds to an overheated economy and stock market, things are starting to improve. It appears that the Fed\u2019s plan of a soft-landing by quantitative tightening to curb inflation without throwing the economy into a deep recession might be working. The recent rally in stock markets and Bitcoin can be attributed to the market's trust in the above narrative.\n\nHowever, another essential American agency, the U.S. Treasury, poses significant risks to the global economy. While the Fed has been draining liquidity from the markets, the Treasury provided a countermeasure by draining its cash balance and negating some of the Fed's efforts. This situation may be coming to an end.\n\nIt invokes risks of constrained liquidity conditions with the possibility of an adverse economic shock. For this reason, analysts warn that the second half of 2023 may see excess volatility.\n\nBackdoor liquidity injections negate the Fed\u2019s quantitative tightening\n\nThe Fed started its quantitative tightening in April by increasing the interest rates on its borrowings. The aim was to reduce inflation by constraining the market's liquidity. Its balance sheet shrank by $476 billion during this period, which is a positive sign considering that inflation dropped and employment levels stayed healthy.\n\nU.S. Fed Balance sheet. Source: U.S. Federal Reserve\n\nHowever, during the same time, the U.S. Treasury used its Treasury General Account (TGA) to inject liquidity into the market. Typically, the Treasury would sell bonds to raise additional cash to meet its obligations. However, since the nation\u2019s debt was close to its debt ceiling level, the federal department used its cash to fund the deficit.\n\nU.S. Treasury General Account Balance. Source: MacroMicro\n\nEffectively, it\u2019s a backdoor liquidity injection. The TGA is a net liability of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. The Treasury had drained $542 million from its TGA account since April 2022, when the Fed began rate hikes. Independent macro market analyst Lyn Alden told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cU.S. Treasury is drawing down its cash balance to avoid going over the debt ceiling, which is adding liquidity into the system. So, the Treasury has been offsetting some of the QT that the Fed is doing. Once the debt ceiling issue gets resolved, the Treasury will be refilling its cash account, which pulls liquidity out of the system.\u201d\n\nDebt ceiling issue and potential economic fallout\n\nThe U.S. Treasury\u2019s debt totaled approximately $31.45 trillion as of Jan. 23. The number represents the total outstanding of the U.S. government accumulated over the nation\u2019s history. It is crucial because it has reached the Treasury\u2019s debt ceiling.\n\nThe debt ceiling is an arbitrary number set by the U.S. government that limits the amount of Treasury bonds sold to the Federal Reserve. Hitting it means that the government can no longer take on additional debts.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. has to pay interest on its national debt of $31.4 trillion and spend on the welfare and development of the country. These expenditures include salaries of public medical practitioners, educational institutions and pension beneficiaries.\n\nNeedless to say, the U.S. government spends more than it makes. Thus, if it can\u2019t raise debt, there\u2019ll have to be a cut in either interest rate payments or government expenditures. The first scenario means a default in U.S. government bonds, which opens a big can of worms, starting with a loss of trust in the world\u2019s largest economy. The second scenario poses uncertain but real risks as failure to meet public goods payment can induce political instability in the country.\n\nBut, the limit is not set in stone; the U.S. Congress votes on the debt ceiling and has changed it many times. The U.S. Treasury Department notes that \u201csince 1960, Congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit \u2014 49 times under Republican presidents and 29 times under Democratic presidents.\u201d\n\nIf history is any indication, lawmakers are more likely to resolve those issues by raising the debt ceiling before any real damage is done. However, in that case, the Treasury would be inclined to increase its TGA balance again; the department\u2019s target is $700 billion by 2023 end.\n\nEither by draining out its liquidity completely by June or with the help of a debt ceiling amendment, the backdoor liquidity injections into the economy would come to a close. It threatens to create a challenging situation for risk-on assets.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation with stock markets remains strong\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation with the U.S. stock market indexes, especially the Nasdaq 100, remains near all-time highs. Alden noted that FTX\u2019s collapse suppressed the crypto market in Q4 2022 when the equities rallied on slower rate hike expectations. And while Congress delays its decision on the debt ceiling, favorable liquidity conditions have allowed Bitcoin\u2019s price to rise.\n\nBTC/USD price chart with Bitcoin-Nasdaq correlation coefficient. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, the correlation with the stock markets is still strong, and movements in S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 will likely continue influencing Bitcoin\u2019s price. Nik Bhatia, a financial researcher, wrote about the importance of the stock market\u2019s direction for Bitcoin. He said,\n\n\u201c\u2026in the short term, market prices can be very wrong. But over the more intermediate term, we have to take trends and trend reversals seriously.\u201d\n\nWith the risks from the ongoing Fed\u2019s quantitative tightening and stoppage of Treasury liquidity injections, the markets are expected to stay vulnerable through the second half of 2023.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 9.89% from Jan. 20 to Jan. 27, to US$23,003 at 4:30 p.m. on Friday afternoon in Hong Kong. Ether gained 2.26% in the same timeframe, to change hands at US$1,582.\n\n\u201cThe rally is driven by a broader sentiment in the financial markets. The belief is that inflation has peaked and the economic slowdown will force the Fed to soften its stance on interest rates. This might result in 1 or 2 quarters without any rate hike and help the general available liquidity in the market,\u201d Dinesh Goel, founder of play-to-earn ecosystem One World Nation told Forkast in a LinkedIn message.\n\n\u201cThis, however, is coupled with a looming fear of an impending recession. The mixed signals are prompting investors to divert a part of their wealth to gold or Bitcoin,\u201d said Goel, adding that Bitcoin\u2019s rally is also driven by investors who see it as a store of wealth.\n\nBonnie Cheung, head of strategy at Web3 communications protocol Sending Labs, attributes the crypto price rally this year to both macroeconomic factors and the removal of what she called crypto tourists.\n\n\u201cAside from the macros, where inflation fearmongers seem to have taken a backseat, don\u2019t forget that while the \u201ccrypto tourists\u201d have disappeared largely as a result of all the fallouts from centralized crypto finance players, the builders never stopped building,\u201c Cheung said in an email.\n\nKasper Vandeloock, the chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital, says the Bitcoin rally is due to short positions being liquidated and the industry recovering from FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\n\u201cAs you can see in the screenshot linked below, there have been quite some large liquidations and open interest wipes. Besides that, tech [equities] has been having some slight recoveries which has a strong correlation to crypto,\u201d wrote Vandeloock.\n\nPolygon\u2019s MATIC was the week\u2019s biggest gainer among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, up 14.4% on the weekly chart, trading at US$1.08.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at US$1.05 trillion on Friday at 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 7.58% from US$976 billion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$443 billion represented 42.37% of the market, while Ether took up 17.9%.\n\nSmart contract blockchains gain\n\nThe Threshold (T) token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market cap listed on CoinMarketCap, having rallied 129% to trade at US$0.050 after Coinbase added the token to its listings roadmap.\n\nAptos\u2019 APT token was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer, having rallied 118% to trade at US$17.69. Fantom\u2019s FTM had the third-best performance, up 53.5% to change hands at US$0.46.\n\n\u201cAptos has been doing a great job of speed-building a vibrant community and playing catch-up to early comers such as Solana, perhaps even replacing it as the new Ethereum killer,\u201d wrote Cheung.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you have successfully rode through the last two crypto market cycles, you know the two things you will look at first are the market capital vs fully diluted valuation (currently at 15.86%, meaning ~85% of APT tokens are still locked up), and the most active exchanges where the token is traded, which for APT is surprisingly not Binance but Upbit, one of Korea\u2019s largest exchanges. These two factors will help you gauge if the pump has a second act.\u201d\n\nVandeloock said it\u2019s unclear what triggered Aptos\u2019 rally, \u201cbut it later got a lot of traction from traders looking for volatility. Tens of millions of shorts also got liquidated in this leg up,\u201d said Vandeloock, referring to the screenshot below that he shared with Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Cold comfort: Is Crypto Winter the right time to invest in Web3?\n\nWhat\u2019s in store next week?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), a popular technical indicator for market analysts, reached 80 on the weekly chart, signaling that Bitcoin is \u201coverbought.\u201d One World Nation\u2019s Goel said that investors should be mindful of this metric and that \u201cwe should expect price correction within the next 2 weeks.\u201d\n\nVandeloock wasn\u2019t quite on board with that view, saying that RSI is based on historical volatility and \u201cat a moment of low volatility it adds little value to the overall events.\u201d He said he does expect a downward move in the short term, but remains bullish in the mid to long term.\n\nGoel said that investors should be mindful of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) meeting at the end of January.\n\nSee related article: World Economic Forum\u2019s digital asset head expects real-world blockchain adoption in 2023\n\n\u201cThe trajectory of interest rates will govern the movement in the crypto market to a large extent. How the US government handles the FTX scam and the impending allegations against Binance will also play a crucial role in the overall market sentiment,\u201c Goel wrote.\n\nSending Labs\u2019 Cheung said that the crypto market is entering the accumulation stage of the four-year Bitcoin halving cycle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hitting that up-ramp part of the four-year halving cycle. In the past, around 18 months ahead of the halving is when price starts to build out the bottom. This time, the 18-month period started in September 2022, when it was trading around 19K-20K,\u201d Cheung said.\n\n(Updates to change Bitcoin price comparison period in deck.)"

It was initially filed last year on May 13, a month after Ark\u2019s first attempt to list the product on BZX was turned down.\n\nAn ETF\u2014short for \u201cexchange-traded fund\u201d\u2014is an investment vehicle offering indirect exposure to an underlying asset. This can be useful for investing in items that are difficult to own and store by oneself, such as gold, or for many, cryptocurrency.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rationale for the decision is the same as last time: Ark has failed to demonstrate that the rules of its exchange are adequate to protect the investing public from \u201cfraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\u201d\n\nGrayscale: SEC Argument for Blocking Bitcoin Spot ETF 'Illogical'\n\n\u201cAn exchange that lists bitcoin-based ETPs can meet its obligations under Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) by demonstrating that the exchange has a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to the underlying or reference bitcoin assets,\u201d explained the SEC in its rejection.\n\nETFs would also give institutions a green light to effectively buy Bitcoin when they are otherwise barred from doing so by internal charter.

The purpose of the proposed fund was to allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s price within the confines of the regulated stock market.\n\nThe Cboe BZX Exchange had originally asked to list the ETF in June 2021. After the first application was rejected in 2022, it reapplied and made new legal arguments in an attempt to get the fund approved.\n\nIn its second application back in May, the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange argued that it has a \u201ccomprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size\u201d that can prevent manipulation of prices. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF should therefore be allowed to be listed, the exchange argued. According to the application, this surveillance sharing agreement is with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where Bitcoin futures contracts are traded.\n\nThe application also argued that most currency and commodity spot markets are unregulated, but this does not usually mean that an application will be rejected for that reason alone.\n\nRelated: SEC\u2019s \u2018one-dimensional\u2019 approach is slowing progress: Grayscale CEO\n\nIn its response, the SEC rejected these arguments. It stated that the surveillance sharing agreement between Cboe BZX Equities Exchange and the CME does not apply to spot Bitcoin, since only Bitcoin futures contracts are traded at CME.\n\nThe SEC also claimed that having a surveillance sharing agreement is not always necessary, but if such an agreement does not exist, then the exchange must \u201cestablish that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices will be sufficient.\u201d It said that the exchange has not demonstrated this point, so it is not allowing the ETF to be listed.\n\nThe SEC has so far not approved any spot Bitcoin ETF to be listed on an exchange. Grayscale Investment Trust is seeking to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, and it has sued the SEC for rejecting its proposal. Oral arguments are scheduled to be heard for the Grayscale case in March."

However, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on Jan. 27. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 7-day funding rate was positive for Bitcoin and Ethereum, meaning the data points to slightly higher demand for leverage longs (buyers) versus shorts (sellers). Still, a 0.25% weekly funding cost is not enough to discourage leverage buyers.\n\nInterestingly, Aptos was the only exception as the altcoin presented a negative 0.6% weekly funding cost, with short sellers paying to keep their positions open. This movement can be explained by the 91% rally in seven days and it suggests that sellers expect some sort of technical correction.\n\nThe options put/call ratio shows no signs of fear\n\nTraders can gauge the market\u2019s overall sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30% and is therefore bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options by 40%, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio.

More importantly, leverage indicators show bulls are not using excessive leverage.\n\nDerivatives markets point to further upside potential. Even if the market revisits the $950 billion market capitalization from Jan. 18, there is no reason for panic. Currently, Bitcoin option markets show whales and market makers favoring the neutral-to-bullish strategies.\n\nUltimately, the odds favor those betting that the $1 trillion total market cap will hold, opening room for further gains.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin hashrate trends - Coinbase",
        "content": "Following 2021 \u2014 a period of rapid capacity expansion and profitability growth for bitcoin miners \u2014 2022 quickly became a comparatively tumultuous year for many operators, particularly those located in North America. A confluence of headwinds, both macroeconomic and crypto-specific, severely impacted the profitability of certain mining operators over the past twelve months, forcing many to restructure their balance sheets or even enter bankruptcy. Notably, however, the hashrate of the bitcoin network \u2014 a measure of the aggregate computing power competing to successfully mine the next block of bitcoin transactions \u2014 has maintained its upward trajectory amidst these headwinds and is currently near all-time-highs. In this report, we explore the cyclical nature of bitcoin mining and the competitive forces driving aggregate network hashrate ever-higher, despite challenging economics for miners and meaningful distress observed in the public markets. While the divergence between bitcoin price and network hashrate observed since late 2021 has caused some pain for certain mining operators, the persistence of network hashrate growth can be an indicator of the heightening security of the bitcoin network and a reflection of the increasing demand for bitcoin mining. The increasing demand for bitcoin mining globally, combined with its industrialization through the growth of public market miners in North America, has the potential to continue to support the upward trajectory of network hashrate in the year ahead. While higher aggregate hashrate may dampen the profitability of smaller scale or less well-capitalized operators (as larger, more well-capitalized players consolidate market share), the current trajectory is objectively a positive outcome for the broader security of the bitcoin network. Chart 1. Bitcoin price and hashrate with key events\n\nInherent cyclicality Given the historical volatility and cyclical nature of bitcoin\u2019s price \u2014 in part driven by the supply side impact of new issuance halving every four years \u2014 it is reasonable to suggest that the business of bitcoin mining would be subject to some amount of cyclicality. Indeed, the market dynamics which characterize the bitcoin mining industry are directionally similar to the production cycles for traditional commodities, such as gold. As demand for the underlying commodity increases, the competition among market participants to establish or expand their operational footprint intensifies and the various inputs associated with building incremental capacity become more expensive. Ultimately, this operational response to an increase in demand of the underlying asset naturally materializes on a lagged basis, expanding up until the point where the demand growth for the underlying asset slows and the cycle begins to turn. Chart 2. ASIC hardware prices per model With respect to bitcoin mining, Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC, machines can be viewed as the primary \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d of the industry. We can establish the timeline of this most recent mining cycle by looking at the trajectory of price fluctuations for ASICs over the past few years. Beginning in late 2020, ASIC prices began a rapid ascent in response to the acceleration in the price of bitcoin. While ASIC prices are a decent real-time indicator of increased demand for bitcoin mining, the deployment of ASICs can take anywhere from 3 to 12 months (or even longer given pandemic-induced supply chain issues), meaning that the eventual impact on network hashrate and difficulty occurs on a lagged basis. From late 2020 to early 2022, many mining operators in North America sought to expand their operations to take advantage of the increased profitability of mining, given the rising bitcoin price. This intent to deploy hashrate in the region was accelerated by the Chinese hashrate migration stemming from China\u2019s mining ban in mid 2021, which added to the backlog of hardware awaiting deployment in North America. As operators rushed to acquire ASICs, build infrastructure and deploy hashrate, many took on excessive debt, often collateralized by their bitcoin holdings or ASIC hardware. In hindsight, it is clear that many of these loans did not appropriately account for the possibility of a meaningful decline in the price of bitcoin. Further, once the price of bitcoin began to decline in earnest in March/April 2022, the mounting pressure on miner economics was compounded by factors exogenous to crypto such as rising energy costs and tighter credit conditions. The situation became particularly worrisome for operators who had entered variable rate agreements on either their power contracts or loans, or had failed to appropriately hedge their power costs. This amalgamation of headwinds forced many operators into distress, while those that had more conservatively managed their balance sheets were positioned to capture incremental market share.\n\nPublic miner overview Despite the prevalence of privately held operators in the industry (~177 exahashes (EH)/s or ~75% of aggregate hashrate as of October 2022), publicly traded bitcoin miners represent a rapidly growing segment of the global market for hashrate. The business of bitcoin mining has become increasingly industrialized in recent years as more operators are looking to take advantage of greater access to equity and debt financing available in developed capital markets. Despite a difficult 2022, many of the mining operators in North America are forecasting extensive capacity expansion plans for 2023. Due to the enhanced transparency of these public entities that are required to issue audited financials to shareholders, they can serve as a useful barometer for the health of the mining industry. It should be noted, however, that miners in North America face relatively difficult conditions compared to the global market for hashrate. While they certainly benefit from relative regulatory clarity and developed capital markets, they\u2019ve had to endure rising energy costs , as well as an increasing cost of capital stemming from interest rate hikes. Further, given the influx of hashrate migrating to North America over the past few years, miners in the region may have felt compelled to aggressively expand their operations. Effectively, if a particular operator's share of network hashrate is not growing commensurate with the growth of the aggregate network, their market share is being diluted. A cohort of the top 15 public miners in North America that we will reference throughout this section had a combined hashrate of ~58 EH/s at the end of 2022, representing ~21.9% of aggregate network hashrate. Over the course of 2022, the bitcoin network\u2019s hashrate increased by ~50% and the cohort of public miners detailed in Chart 3 grew their aggregate hashrate by ~109%, thus increasing their relative share of the network (from ~15.7% at the start of the year to ~21.9% by year-end). As shown below, certain miners were able to grow commensurate with (or even beyond) the aggregate growth of network hashrate (>50%), while others lost relative market share within the past year. Those operators that grew their hashrate by greater than ~109% took relative share within this cohort of public miners. Chart 3. Hashrate growth of top public miners in 2022 Hashrate growth, however, does not paint the full picture for this cohort of miners. Certain miners pushed aggressively to expand their hashrate at the expense of the health of their balance sheets. Leverage in the form of ASIC-backed loans became increasingly problematic in early 2022 as the price of ASICs began to plummet. Core Scientific, which filed for bankruptcy in December, raised a total of ~$366M over the past two years from six creditors, collateralized by their hardware (representing 8.9 EH/s of their 15.7 EH/s of total hashrate reported at year-end). Accordingly, the fair market value of the collateral backing these loans (which are now being restructured through bankruptcy) has fallen dramatically (in the range of ~50-70%). Interestingly, the creditors which supplied these ASIC-backed loans to miners are also in a precarious position, as their recourse options include becoming mining operators themselves (taking possession of the ASICs), liquidating the ASICs into a relatively illiquid and declining market, or working with borrowers to restructure the debt. For many creditors, the third option is actually the path of least resistance. While some mining operators are better positioned than others (i.e. those that were more conservative with debt financing and appropriately hedged power costs), it should not be entirely surprising that the most distressed mining operators happen to be located in North America, given the circumstances. Rising input costs, excessive leverage and an environment of increased competition all contributed to the current positioning of this cohort of operators. Chart 4 depicts the total debt levels across this cohort of miners (per EH/s of hashrate), as well as their amount of bitcoin reserves held at year-end. The total debt of this cohort of miners as of their last public filings is approximately US$2.4B in aggregate and they held a combined ~33k BTC (~US$760M) in their reserves at year-end. These metrics provide some insight into the financial positioning of these firms in the context of their go-forward ability to generate and accumulate new bitcoin. Firms like Hut8 and Riot have been able to amass large BTC reserves with relatively little debt. Chart 4. Total debt (per EH/s of hashrate) and bitcoin reserves of top public miners (as of Dec. 31, 2022)\n\nOne miner\u2019s distress is another\u2019s opportunity While mining conditions remain stressed for many operators, the theoretical decline in network hashrate resulting from ASICs being unplugged in North America has largely been offset by incremental sources of hashrate coming online. While data on the scale of some of these new operations and their precise origins is relatively sparse, there are a handful of plausible sources of incremental hashrate being deployed over the past twelve months, namely: Well-capitalized operators in North America : Firms like Riot, Cleanspark and Bit Digital were more conservative with regard to leverage than their peers prior to credit conditions tightening and were able to grow their share of network hashrate over the course of 2022. Further, many of the mining operators in North America have provided forward guidance suggesting meaningful capacity expansion in 2023. It is also worth noting that Foundry, a privately held bitcoin mining pool operator domiciled in the US (a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group), nearly quadrupled its hashrate over the past year (~86 EH/s at current) and is now the largest bitcoin mining pool in the world.\n\n: Firms like Riot, Cleanspark and Bit Digital were more conservative with regard to leverage than their peers prior to credit conditions tightening and were able to grow their share of network hashrate over the course of 2022.

Private or state-owned operators in regions with access to low-to-zero cost energy : Areas such as Russia , the Middle East , Africa and South America have seen increased demand for bitcoin mining leading to meaningful investments to build out mining capacity, typically taking advantage of cheap or otherwise stranded energy sources. Further, this mining cycle may differ from past cycles in that there are more incentives to engage in bitcoin mining, outside of pure speculation on the price of bitcoin. Increasingly, market participants are leveraging the bitcoin network for more specialized use cases, including: The geography-agnostic monetization of stranded energy sources that would otherwise be wasted or are uneconomical to transport to a grid/population : Natural gas flare capture represents a form of bitcoin mining that is actually a net positive in terms of emissions, as it converts otherwise flared methane into carbon dioxide, a much less dense form of carbon emissions. Large energy companies including Shell and Exxon have begun to engage with bitcoin mining, as they can bolster the profitability of their existing operations by monetizing otherwise stranded energy, while also reducing their net emissions.\n\n: Natural gas flare capture represents a form of bitcoin mining that is actually a net positive in terms of emissions, as it converts otherwise flared methane into carbon dioxide, a much less dense form of carbon emissions. Large energy companies including Shell and Exxon have begun to engage with bitcoin mining, as they can bolster the profitability of their existing operations by monetizing otherwise stranded energy, while also reducing their net emissions. Demand response programs aimed at stabilizing isolated energy grids : Bitcoin miners represent a very unique buyer of energy that has the ability to curtail their consumption at any time (known as an interruptible energy load), while most large industrial consumers of energy are unable to economically interrupt their operations. The two main forms of \u201cdemand response\u201d being implemented by mining operators include: (1) negotiating with energy providers/utility companies to lock in a static low cost of electricity for a certain period of time (typically below market rates), under the condition that they will curtail (turn off) when demand from the grid spikes (periods of peak demand). Miners engaging in this form of demand response will ensure that the benefits of mining at a lower static cost will outweigh the potential downtime expected during periods of peak demand. Alternatively, (2) miners will sell power (i.e. turn off machines) back to the market at spot rates. In this arrangement, miners aren\u2019t necessarily forced to curtail in response to peak demand, but instead are directly monetarily incentivized to do so. They will only engage in this form of demand response if the spot rates afforded to them by the market outweigh the profits they would have otherwise generated by mining bitcoin. This method is most prominently implemented by miners operating within the Texas/ERCOT grid.\n\n: Bitcoin miners represent a very unique buyer of energy that has the ability to curtail their consumption at any time (known as an interruptible energy load), while most large industrial consumers of energy are unable to economically interrupt their operations.

This method is most prominently implemented by miners operating within the Texas/ERCOT grid. Bootstrapping renewable (and intermittent) energy sources : The largest impediment for wind and solar capacity to effectively support populations at scale is the near-term profitability of those operators. The intermittent nature of wind and solar, combined with the imbalance of excess capacity versus what can actually be transported to grids for use, means that early-stage wind and solar projects are often producing energy that goes unused. Bitcoin mining can complement the build-out of this capacity by offering a profitable means of energy usage during times of off-peak demand (i.e. smoothing out the intermittency). A joint venture between Tesla, Block, and Blockstream announced last year plans to employ this concept in West Texas, creating a financial incentive to construct solar capacity through mining bitcoin. These incentive-based sources of incremental hashrate are not necessarily dependent on the operators\u2019 desire to accumulate bitcoin, as is traditionally the case for mining operators. Instead, bitcoin mining is being used as a tool to directly monetize energy sources that would otherwise be stranded or uneconomical to transport to a grid or population."

        "title": "Why I think Bitcoin could be a key to saving the environment - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "Why I think Bitcoin could be a key to saving the environment\n\nby Susie Violet Ward\n\nMost people have heard about Bitcoin but they are unsure about what it is. Its magic internet money, only used by criminals and has no intrinsic value are some of the common misconceptions. Even governments, traditional fund managers and journalists do not yet understand this new technology. The FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in the media is often misinformed or downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that allows money to cross borders without a 3rd party within milliseconds, 24 hours a day and for pennies. It solves a multitude of issues we have with our current financial system including fraud and trust. All transactions are recorded on an open-source blockchain. Since Bitcoin\u2019s inception on January 3 2009, it has never been hacked.\n\nThere is a capped supply of 21 million and each bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 Satoshis. With the Lightning Network, it has the potential to be divided into smaller increments, giving it the potential to be used as a world reserve currency. The Lightning Network is a payment protocol layered on top of the bitcoin blockchain to facilitate faster transactions and is enabling bitcoin to scale.\n\nIts hard-capped supply means it cannot be inflated and no more can be made, thus making this the \u2018hardest money\u2019 known to humanity. It means that in the future your bitcoin is mathematically programmed to go up and not down, unlike the fiat money we use today.\n\nBitcoin is decentralised, meaning it\u2019s operated by a global community of miners and nodes, instead of a central authority. Its rules are programmed into code and cannot easily be changed. Sounds amazing, right? So why are there only a select few who have taken the time to learn about this revolutionary \u2018new\u2019 blockchain technology?\n\nWho created Bitcoin?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and the first widespread application of blockchain technology. This name is a pseudonym to disguise the person or team who developed Bitcoin. Satoshi was active in the development of Bitcoin up until December 2010, then they withdrew from the project and handed it over to developers who have continued to work on the mission. Many people have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto but, in truth, no one knows who he/she/they is/are.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s development started in 2007 and its release coincided with the 2008 Financial Crisis. A few weeks after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch bailout, Satoshi published the Bitcoin White Paper and hid a message in the genesis block, which was mined on 3 January 2009. Satoshi wrote of the failure and injustice of central banking and our fiat system.\n\nHe also wrote : \u201cWe have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.\u201d\n\nThe birth of Bitcoin would eventually lead to us rethinking the existing global financial models and systems currently in place.\n\nMyth busting\n\nMyth 1 \u2013 Bitcoin has no Intrinsic Value\n\nAs mentioned above, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin and this scarcity is a major driver of its value. In addition to this supply cap, the amount of new Bitcoin being mined is declining over time. An event called a \u201chalving\u201d takes place every four years, and the result is block rewards paid to miners in the network are cut in half. This ensures the supply is always reducing which, by the basic economic principle of scarcity, has worked to keep the price of Bitcoin gradually trending upwards over the long term.\n\nBitcoin also provides value from the work the computers on the network contribute via a process called mining. Powerful computers all over the world supply a vast amount of processing power towards the work of validating and securing every transaction and in exchange, they are rewarded with new Bitcoin. This is called \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 and is essential to the security of the network. I\u2019ll come on to this in more detail later.\n\nMyth 2 \u2013 Bitcoin will be replaced by a competitor\n\nThere are about 22,000 cryptocurrencies and some are direct copies of the original Bitcoin white paper; however, Bitcoin currently makes up approximately 60% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. The transparency and virtue of its task as a decentralised and open currency make it unrivalled to date. Cryptocurrencies are technologies trying to solve different problems and there are others with smart contract capabilities however, these are not all decentralised and do not all use proof-of-work (PoW), more on this later.\n\nMyth 3 \u2013 Not secure\n\nIt\u2019s probably one of the only systems on earth that has not yet been hacked. Satoshi\u2019s genius was to make it so it was easier to join the movement and mine Bitcoin than to try and hack it. It simply moves too fast for it to be hackable. It has been up (online) 99.9% of the time since 2009. The amount of computing power it takes to secure the network is large, however it is still relatively small in comparison to the current financial system. The miners that power the network are located around the globe in over 100 countries. The more miners and nodes the stronger the system becomes as there is no single point of failure. In a nutshell, this is the benefit of Proof of Work.\n\nMyth 4 \u2013 Bitcoin is a bubble\n\nBitcoin has gone through multiple price cycles throughout its 14-year history, each time the price has recovered to achieve new highs. As this is a new technology, boom and bust cycles are to be expected. As adoption increases, Bitcoin\u2019s volatility will subside and it will settle into relative stability.\n\nMyth 5 \u2013 Bitcoin has no real life uses\n\nBitcoin can make payments to anyone in the world without a bank or payment processor, all for a fraction of the cost of traditional banking. The disruptive nature of this technology has the potential to make banks and companies such as Mastercard and Visa obsolete as these payment systems have not changed since the beginning of the 20th Century. In addition to this, nearly every human being on the planet has a mobile phone but not everyone has a bank account. This improves accessibility for all. I\u2019d say this has real value.\n\nMyth 6 \u2013 It is a speculative asset\n\nIt could be considered speculative depending on your vantage point. As this new technology is adopted by institutions, I would argue we are coming out of the speculative phase. I would also argue that Bitcoin has held up better against more traditional equities and gold in the past 6 months.\n\nThis leads me to the most important myth:\n\nMyth 7 \u2013 Bitcoin is bad for the environment\n\nI am not disputing that mining Bitcoin is energy intensive but so are all aspects of the digital world and economy we now live in. The current banking system is nearly 10 x more energy-hungry if we look at the global system of processing transactions, running banks and powering offices. Moving away from traditional banking and into DeFi (Decentralised Finance) would be a benefit to the environment.\n\nExtract from Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Energy Use Compared To Other Major Industries\n\nThe amount of energy used by the Bitcoin network is inconsequential compared to other industries. Most industries round off the amount of global energy used by 1-2% and Bitcoin uses approximately 0.002% of the Global Energy in terawatt hours, which is less than a rounding error.\n\nData sources will vary and the Cambridge Bitcoin Electrical Consumption Index shows a slightly higher consumption rate with the caveat that the exact proportion is dependent on fuel type and power plant efficiency. Regardless of where you get the data, consumption in comparison to other industries is low.\n\nCambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index researchers concluded: \u201cBitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint currently remains marginal at best.\u201d The economic incentives fundamental to Bitcoin i.e. finding the cheapest source of energy to mine from, are helping to drive renewable innovation. They need cheap, renewable energy to make mining economically viable.\n\nThe FUD around this industry falls in line with history when any change is implemented which disrupts. What you often read in the news is centralised misinformation. It is found constantly in the writing on this subject and some journalists are often reporting false and misleading information.\n\nEmail was demonised initially and this new technology was considered too energy intensive and the post service was deemed more efficient. The same narrative to the internet, again it consumes too much energy. The energy argument is used ad-nauseum to demonise a switch from an analogue system to a digital system. These narratives just prove one thing; we are early.\n\nStudies have already concluded that running Bitcoin is more efficient than the current system. In fact, due to the FUD around Bitcoin mining, it has driven the industry to find ingenious ways to run mining equipment from stranded and renewable energy.\n\nBitcoin is even mined from the geothermal energy of volcanoes. According to the Bitcoin Mining Council, 59.5% of all energy used is green. They are working to make it 100% renewable. In addition, the Bitcoin Network could reduce global temperatures via the direct reduction of greenhouse gases. This can be made possible with the use and curtailment of methane from landfill and agriculture and much more.\n\nTroy Cross and Michael Saylor say it best\u2026\n\nTroy Cross on Twitter: \u201cOnce they see how mining balances grids\u2026 Once they see how mining incentivizes renewables and nuclear\u2026 Once they see how mining replaces fossil-powered heating\u2026 Once they see how bitcoin substitutes for more carbon-intensive equities\u2026\u201d / Twitter\n\nMichael Saylor on the Bitcoin Environment Argument\n\nHow Bitcoin is helping the environment\n\nIf we can turn excess and stranded energy into a store of value then the renewables industry will become more cost-effective and economically viable. It would provide money to invest and regenerate, making the industry and its companies even more sustainable by providing investment for the future and consuming stranded energy.\n\nExcess natural gas and geothermal are also being utilised. Some renewable plants need to switch off production when there is a chance of overloading the grid. By switching this excess power over to Bitcoin mining it could help stabilise the grid. Bitcoin provides a solution for using this excess energy while creating value.\n\nBitcoin promotes energy independence and this benefit cannot be overstated. Eventually, mining could become a matter of National Security. Countries that produce cheap energy will be independent because they want to mine cheaply and sustainably. The countries that understand the technology, mathematics and engineering behind this will have a geopolitical advantage. A world with more localised energy production is a more robust world.\n\nMining Bitcoin can assist with our climate goals. There are many projects already up and running. Initiatives such as Gridless Compute work in Africa to mine bitcoin while stabilising grids to prevent brown-outs from excess renewable energy. Vespene Energy is using micro-turbines for harnessing waste methane from multiple landfill sites, preventing the methane from being released into the atmosphere. In Texas, Bitcoin miners have returned energy to the grid when additional electricity is required in extreme hot and cold temperatures. These are just a small number of examples.\n\nIf these enterprises were understood and embraced by politicians and businesses, we could be heading towards carbon-negative energy and the potential of decarbonising and stabilising grids using Bitcoin mining; making the grid greener. This is not a proof of concept; it\u2019s happening.\n\nThis Margot Paez quote sums up the current situation beautifully:\n\n\u201cUsing Bitcoin as a tool for fighting for a habitable future is undoubtedly a kind of Hail Mary pass for the climate, but we are running out of time and mass demonstrations and a failing representative democracy are not doing enough.\u201d\n\nOur rampant consumerism is the environment\u2019s worst enemy. If we can create an economy that provides a good store of value available to all it could steer us away from the debt cycle and debasing currencies.\n\nIf you thought your Bitcoin would be worth more in the future you may think twice about what you are purchasing today. This is quite a meaty subject in itself which I\u2019ll save for another day.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance \u2013 ESG\n\nWikipedia describes ESG as \u2018Environmental, social, and corporate governance is an approach to evaluating the extent to which a corporation works on behalf of social goals that go beyond the role of a corporation to maximise profits on behalf of the corporation\u2019s shareholders.\u2019\n\nIt sounds great and is exactly the information we need to make informed decisions. The ethos is good but the execution needs improvement. It\u2019s difficult to audit and open to fraud. It\u2019s another industry innovation, like carbon offsetting which often means very little when you dig into the detail.\n\nThat said, if managed correctly, the ideology has a lot of potential. For example, if a company were to reinvest its ESG credits into renewables, they could be used to incentivise further investment. The billions of dollars of ESG budgets that have been set aside could be redirected to support the mining industry and the work it does to support renewables. If you offset the infrastructure that supports mining, you\u2019ll get a return. It\u2019s the most ESG-friendly technology that has existed.\n\nProof-of-work vs proof-of-stake\n\nThe difference between the two methods is quite involved. To provide a summary, proof-of-stake (POS) uses randomly selected miners to validate transactions, resulting in those with the most wealth/stake enjoying the most control. Proof-of-work (PoW) uses a competitive validation method to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. PoW, therefore, provides the best security and without this, Bitcoin would not be fully decentralised and the fundamentals would be compromised.\n\nIf you remove the PoW consensus accounting technology you remove the innovation. Bitcoin would essentially revert to the old legacy system where the people that control the books and records can control the network and change the code. The innovation is the consensus mechanism that does not rely on trust; an immutable accounting ledger with a self-auditing network.\n\nGreenpeace is championing a \u2018change the code, not the climate\u2019 campaign, partnered with a \u2018rival\u2019 protocol called Ripple. Ripple paid Greenpeace $5,000,000 to promote a \u2018greener Bitcoin\u2019. If Greenpeace understood Bitcoin and its potential they would be an advocate for the Bitcoin Mining Council instead. What is clear is that the corporate side of Greenpeace is driven by funding which often leads to questionable focus.\n\nIf moving to PoS was possible for Bitcoin, it would remove all the greenhouse-gas-reducing benefits that PoW unlocks. PoS is almost a replica of our current system which prevents a new way of reducing greenhouse gases.\n\nChris Bendiksen of Coinshare put it best when he said \u2018\u2019I\u2019d put the chance of Bitcoin ever moving to proof-of-stake at exactly 0%. There is no appetite among Bitcoiners to destroy the security of the protocol by making such a move.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace and Ripple understand their campaign will be fruitless, in the meantime, environmentalists will have to work harder to undo the damage caused.\n\nA more detailed explanation can be found here: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake: Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a monetary, environmental, and social revolution. We are at the beginning of the adoption curve and the potential and possibilities are vast.\n\nThe downside is that we are fighting against an old establishment. The potential of Bitcoin\u2019s disruptive technology could upend the existing financial system. I truly believe that early adopters will reap the rewards and those fighting against the revolution will fall behind in the same way that countries late to adopting the gold standard did.\n\nIf we can think of Bitcoin as digital energy and work mining into our renewable energy innovation, we will be on to a winner. There is now a global system in place that can send value across borders in seconds and for pennies. The unbanked can now be a part of the system.\n\nTo understand Bitcoins\u2019 value, you need to understand the technology, the philosophy and the potential. It\u2019s a global collateral that can be sent to anyone on the planet, with a smart phone, for pennies and received in seconds. Now throw in its green credentials and you have a game changer.\n\nBitcoin the open global network is here to stay and more and more people hold and transact with its BTC token. It is being intimately threaded into our energy grids at the base level and the benefits it brings are finally being recognised. From overbuilding renewables to reducing bills for customers.\n\nNot many industries can take a potent greenhouse gas like methane and convert that into work that both secures a global network and drives down CO2. Bitcoin does this and more. A glimpse of the world weaned off throwaway consumerism and an open landscape where we can see precisely what our money costs us. It should not cost us the world and its ecosystem.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to unlearn what we have always known. We are at a point in history where we can explore, embrace and become empowered by this new technology or become late adopters and fall behind those that had the foresight to investigate and learn. I know which side of history I\u2019d rather be on."

        "title": "'Buy Shiba Inu', Says Early Bitcoin Investor Davinci Jeremie - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "Davinci Jeremie is well-known in the cryptocurrency circles for urging investors to buy Bitcoin back in 2013. He published a video on YouTube on May 9, 2013, asking investors to buy a minimum of $1 worth of BTC. 10 years later, the early Bitcoin adopter is possibly hinting that investors should pay attention to Shiba Inu.\n\nJeremie predicted 10 years ago that buying Bitcoin would change people\u2019s fortunes and deliver them life-changing gains. His prediction, of course, turned out to be true as BTC touched $69,000 in 2021.\n\nJeremie\u2019s remark on Shiba Inu came as a response to a user who asked \u201cWhich Altcoin should I spend my USDT on?\u201d. The early Bitcoin adopter swiftly replied, \u201cUmm SHIB\u201d.\n\nAlso Read: How Long Will Shiba Inu Take To Reach $0.01? Let\u2019s Do the Math\n\nHowever, Jeremie\u2019s response is short and vague with no further explanation on why he believes people should invest in SHIB.\n\nAlso Read: Exclusive: \u2018Here\u2019s What I\u2019ll Do When Shiba Inu Reaches $0.01\u2032\n\nWatcher Guru has reached out to Davinci Jeremie for a comment on why he believes investors should buy Shiba Inu. We are yet to receive a response at the time of publication and will update the story accordingly.\n\nMoreover, the SHIB community is thrilled with Jeremie\u2019s response and is now vouching for it to be a power horse.\n\nYou can watch Jeremie\u2019s video urging investors to buy a minimum of $1 worth of Bitcoin in 2013 below: \u201cLook for the price of lotto ticket you can hold bitcoin for 10 years and become a millionaire,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso Read: Shytoshi Is Right, People Will Not Celebrate When Shibarium Launches\n\nShiba Inu & Bitcoin\n\nSource: Wallpaperflare.com\n\nBitcoin and Shiba Inu are poles apart in terms of price but share similar popularity in the crypto sphere. Both have a larger-than-life following and investors believe the respective cryptocurrencies can generate massive wealth.\n\nHowever, whether Shiba Inu can move in price as Bitcoin did previously, is a question we\u2019ll have to wait and watch for another 10 years to know the answer."

        "title": "Bitstop shakes up bitcoin ATM space with Genesis Coin acquisition - ATM Marketplace",
        "content": "The ATM industry is no stranger to high profile acquisitions and the bitcoin side of the industry has joined the trend. Bitstop, a bitcoin ATM provider, has acquired Genesis Coin, which powers more than 12,000 bitcoin ATMs in the U.S., and accounts for 31.9% of all such machines worldwide.\n\nThe ATM industry is no stranger to high profile acquisitions and the bitcoin side of the industry has joined the trend.\n\nOn Jan. 24, Bitstop, a bitcoin ATM provider, acquired Genesis Coin, which powers more than 12,000 bitcoin ATMs in the U.S., and accounts for 31.9% of all such machines worldwide, according to Coin ATM Radar.\n\nAndrew Barnard and Doug Carrillo, co-founders of Bitstop will take over as CEO and chief strategy officer respectively. Evan Rose, founder CEO of Genesis Coin, will transition as a technical advisor and current board member.\n\n\"Genesis Coin gave birth to the bitcoin ATM industry,\" Barnard said in a press release. \"It's the first and largest bitcoin ATM software platform in the world. Evan built a platform trusted by some of the largest bitcoin ATM operators in our industry, both domestically and internationally, including the Chivo network in partnership with the government of El Salvador.\"\n\nTo learn more about what the acquisition means for the industry, ATM Marketplace reached out to Andrew Barnard, co-founder and CEO of Bitstop, via an email interview.\n\nQ. Can you give a little background on the acquisition?\n\nA. Evan, Doug and I have known of each other since the beginning of the industry. We have been building this industry separately and now we are building it together. We explored a potential partnership in the past, but it was a little too early. We recently got together again to talk about the future at a high-level. The timing was right. The vision alignment felt good. The energy was all there. It felt natural. It came together effortlessly.\n\nQ. What does the geographic reach of the two companies look like?\n\nA.Bitstop and Genesis Coin both have robust coverage in the United States. Genesis Coin has more international presence especially in Latin America with Athena and the Chivo partnership with the government of El Salvador. Bitstop is beginning to establish international operations with strategic partners. We have operators in Europe, Australia and Asia. We plan to focus a lot more on international growth with the added resources we have and some of the partners we are talking to.\n\nQ. How will this improve bitcoin ATM services?\n\nA.Both companies will continue to build out a team. Genesis Coin is beginning to make key hires and grow its team. We believe in efficiency and running lean, but it's also important to make sure there is redundancy, continuity and legacy. You need a team to give operators a strong stable foundation if you want them to build bigger and scale without fear. That's the goal.\n\nIn the short-term we will continue to optimize and enhance current service. Over the long-term, we will evaluate technical synergies and make important strategic decisions about long-term infrastructure investments that support our plans for future growth.\n\nQ. What excites you the most about this acquisition?\n\nA. The opportunity is massive for Genesis Coin and Bitstop. We're the only major United States-based private and white-label platforms remaining that continue to remain independent and neutral. We do not operate machines. We have no operator ownership. We avoid conflicts of interest. We hyper-focus on building the best and most reliable software and supporting our operators' needs so they can deliver maximum value to their customers. We're working with the best operators worldwide both privately owned and publicly traded. Any organic M&A activity happening in this space almost exclusively happens on the Genesis Coin and Bitstop platforms for a reason. We have created a standard for the industry. The future is bright.\n\nQ. Can you share anything about your future plans with Genesis Coin?\n\nA. We can't say too much and we have some more exciting news coming. For now we can say we are evaluating technical synergies between both platforms. We want to help our operators become as hyper efficient as possible while making it easy to scale. There's still many pain points when it comes to operating which lead to excessive overhead. When you look at the traditional ATM space, many operators are still running up to five times the body count compared to a traditional ATM operation. We want to lower that inefficiency difference for Genesis Coin operators by at least 50% within the next two years. We have many ideas on how to accomplish this and believe that this will be a winning formula long-term."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the bellwether of the cryptocurrency market, will peak at US$29,095 in 2023 before dropping to US$26,844 by the end of the year, a new report forecasts.\n\nBut the price of BTC, currently around US$23,000, will jump to US$77,492 in 2025 and US$188,451 in 2030, according to a panel of 56 crypto and fintech specialists gathered by Finder.com, a comparison website for products and services.\n\nSeasonal Tokens creator and founder Ruadhan O thinks bitcoin\u2019s price is still suppressed by worries about the financial health of centralized businesses in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe price is low because possible imminent catastrophes are being priced in,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the end of the year, market sentiment will have changed, and after the fear goes away, the market will rediscover the scarcity of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAs it is, 65% of panellists, including FxPro senior market analyst Alexander Kuptsikevich, believe that BTC is underpriced. Only 20% say it\u2019s priced fairly, while the remaining 16% say it\u2019s overpriced.\n\n\u201cThe phase of the most active cryptocurrency sell-off is over. 2023 will be a year of careful price recovery. However, a real FOMO (fear of missing out) market is unlikely to come until 2024-2025,\u201d Kuptsikevich says.\n\nBitcoin needs two things to rebound: the return of bullishness on Wall Street and the Federal Reserve\u2019s exit from its rate-tightening policy, asserts Finance Magnates senior analyst and editor Damian Chmiel.\n\n\u201cThe former will not happen without the latter, and we are left to wait patiently for now. In the long term, however, I believe bitcoin will become a popular choice among traders,\u201d Chmiel says.\n\nUniversity of Canberra senior lecturer John Hawkins is more bearish, predicting that BTC will close the year at US$10,000, before dropping to US$5,000 in 2025 and US$500 in 2030.\n\nHawkins believes that bitcoin has no useful role as an asset after it\u2019s been \u201cspruiked as a payments instrument, safe haven, inflation hedge and diversification asset\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, more of the crypto companies that are shedding staff and restricting withdrawals, and no longer have FTX to bail them out, will fail, putting downward pressure on the bitcoin price,\u201d he adds.\n\nWhile BTC is currently rallying above US$20,000, the panel expects it to drop to US$13,067 at some point in 2023 \u2013 the lowest it\u2019s been since October 2020.\n\nFollowing the recent market crash and FTX collapse, a fifth (21%) of Finder\u2019s panel believe institutional investors will leave the crypto market for other asset classes this year. However, the majority (75%) think otherwise, while the remaining 4% are unsure.\n\nAskTraders senior cryptocurrency and forex analyst Nick Ranga is one of those who believe that institutional investors will leave crypto this year. Commenting on BTC specifically, he says: \u201cWith inflation still uncomfortably high and recession risk looming, overall market sentiment remains risk-off. US interest rates are expected to peak at around 5% in the first half of 2023 so we could see investors return to riskier assets later in the year. In the short term, there could still be more downside.\u201d\n\nRouge International managing director Desmond Marshall is part of the majority who think institutional investors are here to stay: \u201cUnless there are more sudden surprises like FTX, the market is now undergoing a clean-up of scammy and faulty exchanges and companies. After this clean-up and with the Fed interest continuing to hike, and with the BTC upcoming halving in 2024, there should be stronger support during H2 of 2023.\u201d\n\nOverall 50% of Finder\u2019s panel say now is the time to buy BTC, 37% hold, and 13% sell."
