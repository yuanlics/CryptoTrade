The currency broke into mainstream consciousness in 2017, as its price ran up thousands of dollars over the course of the year. More recently, it skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021, as traders saw it as a way to get rich quickly, before plummeting massively in 2022.\n\nBitcoin has created much controversy, from proponents who say it\u2019s the future of currency to those who decry it as a speculative bubble. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Bitcoin, how it works and some of its drawbacks.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin and how does it work?\n\nBitcoin debuted in 2009, when the software underpinning the currency was released. Its origins are a bit mysterious, however, and a person (or perhaps group) known as Satoshi Nakamoto claims the credit for unveiling the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin operates on a decentralized computer network or distributed ledger using blockchain technology, which manages and tracks the currency. Think of the distributed ledger like a huge public record of transactions taking place in the currency. The networked computers verify the transactions, ensuring the integrity of the data and the ownership of bitcoins, and they\u2019re rewarded with bitcoins for doing so.\n\nThis decentralized network is a huge part of the appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Users can transfer money to each other, and the lack of a central bank to manage the currency makes the currency almost autonomous. This autonomy means that the currency, at least theoretically, can avoid the interference of governments and central banks.\n\nBitcoin can operate mostly anonymously. While transactions might be traceable to certain users, the person\u2019s name is not immediately tied to the transaction, even if the transaction is processed publicly. However, authorities have become better at tracking the movements of bitcoins, because the ledger of bitcoin transactions is publicly available.\n\nWhere do bitcoins come from?\n\nBitcoins are created, or \u201cmined,\u201d when computers on the network verify and process transactions in the currency. Some computers called miners are specially outfitted with high-powered processors that can chew through transactions and earn a part of a bitcoin. So Bitcoin requires a lot of processing power to maintain the network and a lot of electricity to run those computers.\n\nBitcoins aren\u2019t created infinitely, however, and the currency is limited to 21 million whole units. Experts expect the remaining number of bitcoins to be mined out around the year 2140. When this occurs, miners will be rewarded solely with a fee for processing transactions.\n\nWhile the number of bitcoins may be limited, each whole bitcoin can be split into much smaller units. In practice, bitcoins are divided into fractions of a coin to facilitate payments of very small amounts of real currency. A bitcoin can be officially divided into as many as one hundred million parts, which are called satoshi in honor of the mysterious founder.\n\nBitcoin is just one type of cryptocurrency, and literally thousands more have been created. Some of the most popular include Ethereum, Solana and XRP.\n\nUsers can hold and spend bitcoins from a cryptocurrency wallet. A wallet is like a personalized location on the distributed ledger that refers to only your currency holdings. When you acquire bitcoins, your wallet provides a unique cryptographic address to the sender. To spend or send bitcoins, you might scan a retailer\u2019s QR code or direct money to its public address.\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has some advantages as a currency and is popular for many reasons, ranging from the utopian to the capitalistic.\n\n1. Decentralized currency management\n\nThrough its decentralized network and limited number of coins, Bitcoin promises a kind of utopian version of currency. Proponents say that by getting central banks and governments out of the currency game, the currency will maintain its value better over time. By extricating these entities, some say that Bitcoin returns power to the people.\n\n2. Anonymous or semi-anonymous transactions\n\nThe relative anonymity of Bitcoin is also a huge feature for many. Some proponents (such as certain libertarians) like that the government or other authorities cannot easily track who uses the currency. However, such anonymity means that the currency can also be used for criminal activities.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that every transaction is tracked and can be used to reconstruct a given wallet\u2019s spending. It\u2019s all public, allowing any entity to track spending, creating further privacy concerns, even if it\u2019s finally not clear who owns a given wallet.\n\n3. Hard or impossible to counterfeit\n\nBitcoin\u2019s popularity is also due to an entirely practical matter, though. It\u2019s tough to counterfeit, because of the blockchain ledger system that verifies transactions over and over.\n\n4. Surging popularity\n\nBitcoin is also popular because the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency has made it a trendy trading vehicle. Because the value of the currency fluctuates so much, traders can jump in and make (or lose) money. This hype and the perceived limited nature of coins has driven the price of bitcoins much higher over the last decade, though it continues to fluctuate significantly.\n\nDisadvantages of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin suffers from some significant drawbacks that are intrinsic to its design, notably its limit on the number of coins in circulation and its general volatility.\n\n1. Bitcoin is an energy hog\n\nBig computer miners require a lot of energy to operate. Producing the electricity is expensive and pollutes the environment, for what some detractors say is a currency project with little feasibility.\n\nJust how much electricity does Bitcoin use and how much greenhouse gas does it emit? According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Bitcoin would rank as the 27th highest user of electricity, if it were a country as of April 2023. It would rank 70th in terms of its greenhouse gas emissions. Those are huge numbers for a rarely used digital currency.\n\n2. The number of coins is limited\n\nBy its very nature, the number of coins is limited, and that poses a serious problem on using Bitcoin as a currency. In effect, this limit does not allow the money supply to be increased, which is valuable when an economy experiences recession. If used throughout an economy, Bitcoin could create destructive deflationary spirals, which were more typical when economies ran on the gold standard. In fact, this concern is a key reason why the gold standard was eliminated.\n\nA challenging situation arises when consumers and others hoard currency during tough economic times. When money doesn\u2019t flow, it slows the economy. Without a central authority such as a bank to stoke the economy or offer credit, the economy could move into a deflationary spiral. So consumers don\u2019t spend because goods will be cheaper tomorrow, creating a destructive spiral.\n\nWith a fixed number of units, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t provide the flexibility needed to manage a system-wide currency.\n\n3. A volatile currency is useless\n\nImagine going to a restaurant where the prices moved up or down every day, sometimes by 10 percent or more. If this sounds like an unattractive prospect, then it\u2019s exactly what makes Bitcoin virtually useless as a currency. While volatility makes Bitcoin attractive for traders, it renders it all but worthless as a medium of exchange.\n\nConsumers need to know what a currency can buy when they make spending decisions. If they expect the currency to rise \u2013 or even skyrocket \u2013 there\u2019s little incentive for them to use it as currency.\n\n4. Government regulation is coming\n\nGovernments have been relatively slow to react to the advent of cryptocurrency, but many have now woken up and are beginning to study how to regulate it. Some countries, such as China, have banned it outright, while others are considering doing so. Still others, such as the United States, are examining how they might regulate cryptocurrency more effectively.\n\nWhat form the U.S. regulation takes remains unclear, though President Joe Biden has tasked the federal government with studying cryptocurrencies, the risks to financial stability and national security, the environmental impact and even the creation of a digital dollar.\n\nThe move to a clear regulatory framework is vital in light of the high-profile blow-up of TerraUSD, a stablecoin cryptocurrency that\u2019s meant to hold a fixed value. The creation of a digital dollar, with the stability of real dollars, may make private cryptocurrencies less attractive.\n\n5. Any transaction is reportable to the IRS\n\nThe laws surrounding cryptocurrency are onerous for consumers, making it tough to use.\n\nThe IRS now requires you to declare on your annual tax return if you\u2019ve had any transaction in a cryptocurrency in the current tax year. And if you sell crypto assets or make a transaction with one, you could create a tax liability. So you\u2019ll need to keep clear records of your buy and sell prices if you\u2019re using the digital currency, lest you run afoul of the law and run up a tax bill.\n\nHere\u2019s the full rundown on what you need to know about cryptocurrency taxes.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile Bitcoin is an interesting experiment, it has serious drawbacks that make it difficult to achieve the stated mission of being a medium of exchange or even a store of value. In fact, one of the world\u2019s greatest investors, Warren Buffett, has called the currency \u201cprobably rat poison squared\u201d and has said that it\u2019s not the kind of thing he considers an investment. Add on the fact that governments could potentially shut down the currency, and it\u2019s a risky investment at best. Still, if you\u2019re looking to get started trading cryptocurrency, here are the key things you need to know."

        "content": "Today, Majority Whip Tom Emmer (MN-06) and Representative French Hill (AR-02) sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler regarding Chair Gensler\u2019s regulatory hypocrisy and inconsistency in his treatment of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETP) applications.\n\nOver the last decade, over twenty spot bitcoin ETP applications have been filed with the SEC, but none have been approved. Chair Gensler has denied all bitcoin spot ETP applications in the United States, citing concerns over fraud and manipulation in the market. Chair Gensler, however, has authorized bitcoin futures ETPs to trade, even though the pricing for those futures contracts is derived entirely from the same market he claims is fraught with fraud and manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been unacceptable,\u201d said Emmer. \u201cChair Gensler has exhibited regulatory inconsistency between his treatment of bitcoin futures ETPs, which he has allowed to trade in the United States, and bitcoin spot ETPs, which he continually denies the American people from accessing. The SEC must provide consistency of treatment to the marketplace and retail investors in the United States are worse off because of the Chair\u2019s decision to deny all bitcoin spot ETP applications. We look forward to the SEC\u2019s response to our concerns.\u201d\n\nHill said, \u201cThe reasoning behind the SEC\u2019s continued refusal to approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) appears to be inconsistent and doesn\u2019t take into account what we know from other jurisdictions where regulators have approved similar products. We look forward to Chair Gensler\u2019s appearance before the Financial Services Committee today and his response to our letter.\u201d\n\nBoth Emmer and Hill serve as members of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nText of the letter is available here.\n\n###"

        "content": "For Eddy Zillan\u2019s bar mitzvah in 2012, his parents gave him $5,000 to start an investment fund. They expected him to start dabbling in stocks. Instead, he began buying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nEddy saved up another $7,000 from summers spent working at a tennis club and other jobs, adding that to his investment fund for a total $12,000 in principal.\n\nAnybody who has been following cryptocurrencies knows where this story is going: Eddy\u2019s $12,000 investment is now worth well over $500,000, a return exceeding 4,100% in just a few years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a prodigy, but he\u2019s close,\u201d says Eddy\u2019s father, Gary Zillan. Eddy, now 18, is a high school senior in Orange, Ohio, near Cleveland. He hopes to study dentistry next year at Case Western Reserve University. But if that doesn\u2019t work out, he has a Plan B, since he just launched a company that provides tutorials and insights on cryptocurrencies. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll be a multimillionaire by the time he\u2019s my age,\u201d says his father, who is 46.\n\nEddy Zillan, 18, of Orange, Ohio, has amassed well over $500,000 worth of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. (Photo courtesy of Eddy Zillan)\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are suddenly the hottest investment since the dot-com bubble, after a stunning surge in value during the last year.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, has soared by more than 700% in 2017. Ethereum is up a mind-boggling 3,900% \u2014 and early purchasers are suddenly watching the zeroes multiply on their accounts. Many crypto investors are reluctant to talk about their holdings, since alt-currencies are still associated with illicit activity, and they tend to appeal to non-traditionalists in the first place. But we found some willing to tell us their experiences. There are also plenty of detractors who insist cryptocurrencies are Ponzi schemes or worse. Yet regulators may soon bestow validity on cryptocurrencies by allowing broader investments, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), to track their value.\n\nThe origins of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a digital payment system launched in 2009 by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. A network of coders with powerful computers has slowly \u201cmined\u201d more bitcoin since then by running complex computations that adhere to a set of founding principles, making bitcoin a kind of crowd-sourced currency. The market value of all bitcoin in the world is around $132 billion at current prices, roughly comparable to the current value of McDonald\u2019s (MCD).\n\nStory continues\n\nOther cryptocurrencies, sometimes referred to as \u201caltcoins,\u201d have emerged as well, including ether, the token of the blockchain network ethereum ($32 billion in market cap), ripple ($9 billion), litecoin ($3.7 billion) and dash ($3.3 billion).\n\nIn a recent Yahoo Finance survey, 77% of respondents told us they have never purchased bitcoin \u2014 but of those, 11% said they\u2019re planning to, and 38% said they\u2019re thinking about it. As more people buy in, that interest alone could send the crypto rally even higher.\n\n[See the full results of our bitcoin survey, conducted online Nov. 10-13.]\n\nOrdinary people can buy cryptocurrencies through services like Coinbase, SpectroCoin or Kraken, usually by linking a bank account or credit card and following simple instructions. (Disclosure: I own a small amount of bitcoin.)\n\nOf 1,011 poll respondents saying they\u2019ve purchased Bitcoin, 71% have made money. Source: Yahoo Finance survey conducted via SurveyMonkey\n\nCritics such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and hedge-fund titan Ray Dalio see cryptocurrencies as a craze that will eventually implode, akin to tulips or Enron. But Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Mark Cuban are believers, and many investors think bitcoin and other digital currencies are like the Internet in 1995 \u2014 a transformative technology about to erupt.\n\nThe money is certainly real.\n\nBitcoin as currency\n\nPeter Saddington of Atlanta first read about bitcoin in 2011, and bought some for less than $3 per coin. With bitcoin now trading at around $7,500, the return on those early investments is around 250,000%. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d says Saddington, 35, an entrepreneur who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and three master\u2019s degrees. \u201cWhat solidified my confidence that this is worth investing in is that the code is based on math. It can\u2019t really be turned off.\u201d\n\n[Had a wild experience with cryptocurrencies? Let us know! Email us at rickjnewman@yahoo.com.]\n\nIn October, Saddington cashed out 45 bitcoins to buy a 2015 Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n, for the equivalent of about $238,000. He and the seller made the transaction in bitcoin, without using a traditional bank. The transaction fees totaled $7.50.\n\nSaddington, who runs a cryptocurrency social network called TheBitcoin.pub, deliberately sought a supercar he could purchase with bitcoin in order to tout the credibility of the currency. \u201cBuying the Lambo with bitcoin is proof it can be used for real transactions, buying really cool stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only used by criminals.\u201d\n\nAs for how much bitcoin he still holds, he says: \u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to wonder about.\u201d\n\nPeter Saddington of Atlanta, 35, in front of the Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n he bought in October for 45 Bitcoin, or $238,000.\n\nA California wine executive we interviewed also tried to buy a fancy car with bitcoin \u2014 and he\u2019s grateful the transaction fell through.\n\nThe 55-year-old saw a friend ask about bitcoin in a Facebook post a few years ago. He researched it and began buying a few coins per month, at prices ranging from $225 to $800, until he accumulated about 80 bitcoins. The wine executive had always wanted an Audi A8L, and in 2016 he saw a slightly used model advertised for $50,000. Since bitcoin had fallen to around $600, that was almost exactly how much bitcoin he had. He sold all his coins to finance the car.\n\nThe owner, however, refused to make any concession on price, which scotched the deal. So, what to do with the $50,000? He decided to put it back into bitcoin, even though the price had risen to $900 by then. At that price, he ended up with just 60 bitcoins \u2014 but that\u2019s now worth more than $450,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more than $120,000 short because I wanted that stupid car,\u201d the wine executive says. \u201cBut by not buying that car, I made almost half a million in profit.\u201d\n\n[Editor's note: This story originally identified the wine executive. We removed identifying information in April 2023 after he received threats and demands to turn over his bitcoin to a criminal enterprise.]\n\nOthers have invested in cryptocurrencies far more aggressively \u2014 with some paying a steep price. When the Mt. Gox digital exchange collapsed in 2014, more than 24,000 customers lost essentially all their holdings. Some customers had dozens or hundreds of bitcoin stored at Mt. Gox, with losses approaching $1 million or more at today\u2019s value.\n\nMore than half of the respondents to our survey think bitcoin is currently overvalued. Source: Yahoo Finance survey conducted via SurveyMonkey\n\nIn our Yahoo Finance survey, 71% of bitcoin buyers said they\u2019ve made money on their investment. But 8% said they had lost money. The median amount of the loss was $500, but some listed five- and six-digit losses. Of those who have made money on bitcoin, the median gain was $3,000, with a few reporting seven-figure hauls.\n\nThe obvious question now is whether the value of bitcoin will continue going up, or whether a speculative bubble is about to burst.\n\nCounting on bitcoin\n\nMany early buyers think bitcoin is only getting started, and at some point will become a mainstream currency used routinely. \u201cIt\u2019s like the early 1990s, when people were asking, \u2018where is this internet thing going to go?\u2019\u201d says a New York bitcoin investor who asked we identify him by his nickname, Duke. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early lunatic adopter phase, slowly shifting to the early adopter phase.\u201d\n\nDuke, who teaches technology at a high school, first tried to buy bitcoin in 2011, but a snafu with a PayPal transaction prevented the transaction. The 30-year-old figured he\u2019d get to it later, but the price jumped to more than $1,000 per coin and he assumed he missed the boat. The price came back down, however, and he eventually bought 21 bitcoins, at prices as low as $200.\n\nAt one point, he spent an entire paycheck buying bitcoin.\n\nNow, with a portfolio worth nearly $160,000, he\u2019s reluctant to cash out even a tiny fraction of coin, for fear of missing out on even bigger gains in the future. \u201cA lot of bitcoin holders are kind of afraid to spend it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could end up spending the equivalent of $2 million on a couple of pizzas. Twenty or thirty years from now, if I have grandkids, maybe I\u2019ll be able to pay for their colleges.\u201d\n\nBy then, maybe schools will even accept tuition payments in bitcoin.\n\nRead more:\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.

Texas also has an increasingly strained power grid that serves only Texas and keeps failing or threatening to overload during winter storms and summer heatwaves.\n\nThis combination of Bitcoin miners' voracious appetite for energy and the finite and capricious quantity of power produced in Texas has led to massive cryptocurrency mines earning money for agreeing to shut down in emergencies, raking in more money for shutting down for brief periods, and leaving Texas residents to foot the bill, The New York Times reports.

Lee Bratcher, president of Bitcoin lobbying group the Texas Blockchain Council, estimates that Bitcoin miners use about 2,100 MW of power in Texas each day, while the Texas state comptroller's office said cryptocurrency mining operations consume 3,000 MW.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the Texas grid, \"projects that mining operations could rise by 6,000 MW in the next couple years and potentially increase to 17,000 MW by 2030,\" or nearly what Houston \u2014 America's fourth-largest city \u2014 uses during peak demand, the comptroller's office said in an August 2022 report.\n\nOn top of that, \"prospective crypto mining businesses have requested to put approximately 33,000 more megawatts in the ERCOT interconnection queue over the next few years (enough to power the whole state of Florida),\" The Texas Observer reports, though nobody expects all of those requests to come to fruition.\n\nWorldwide, in July 2022 Bitcoin mining used the annualized equivalent of 132 terawatt-hours of electricity, \"comparable to the power consumption of Argentina,\" the Texas comptroller's office said. \"A single bitcoin transaction used nearly 1,452 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, equal to the power consumption of an average U.S. household for nearly 50 days.\"\n\nHow have Bitcoin mines turned that into cold hard cash?\n\n\"Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets,\" the Times reports. A significant portion of the revenue large Texas crypto mines rake in comes from their participation in ERCOT's Responsive Reserve Service program, designed to protect the power grid during periods of heavy use.\n\nThe program pays them for their participation and their promise to power down if the grid approaches blackout levels. \"In practice, they rarely are asked to shut down,\" the Times reports. \"Several of the companies are being paid through these agreements a majority of the time they operate. Most years, they are asked to turn off for only a few hours, at which point they are paid even more.\"\n\nBitcoin miners can also avoid fees Texas charges to maintain and bolster the power grid by strategically powering down during peak demand, when those fees are assessed. And when power prices are high, the miners can also shut down and resell their allotted electricity \u2014 which they prepurchase at low rates \u2014 for hefty profits.\n\nThe Times gave two examples of how this works. During 2021's Winter Storm Uri, during which about 40 Texans froze to death during extended blackouts, ERCOT paid Bitdeer's Bitcoin mine in Rockdale an average of $175,000 an hour for not operating, earning the company more than $18 million over four days \u2014 \"from fees ultimately paid by Texans who had endured the storm,\" the Times adds. Another Bitcoin company made tens of millions reselling electricity during Uri.\n\nDuring one day of a June 2022 heatwave, when Riot was earning $342,000 a day mining Bitcoin at its Rockdale facility, it also earned $42,000 from midnight to 4 a.m. for participating in the Responsive Reserve Service program and saved $5.5 million in fees by shutting down from about 4 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. In July 2022, The Texas Observer adds, the same Riot Bitcoin facility earned more from curtailing energy use, $9.5 million, than the $5.6 million in profit it earned mining Bitcoin.\n\nFor all of 2022, the Times reports, Riot made $9.3 million from participating in the blackout-prevention service (despite being asked to reduce power for only about 3.5 hours), saved about $27 million in potential fees, and earned roughly $18 million from reselling electricity to other customers. Riot earned $156.9 million from Bitcoin mining last year.\n\nIs this how the Texas grid is supposed to work?\n\nERCOT told the Times it \"does not discriminate based on the type or activity\" of the companies that sign up for its Responsive Reserve Service program. \"We want to be able to serve any business that wants to do business in Texas,\" Pablo Vegas, ERCOT's new CEO, said in November. \"And that includes crypto miners.\"\n\n\"There's a set of rules that exist,\" Carey King, assistant director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin, told the Observer. And the crypto miners do \"fit the definition of being able to provide ... emergency response services.\"\n\n\"I think they're exploiting the system,\" Severin Bornstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told the Times. \"But they will say, 'You know, the system was already there,' and I'm sympathetic to that in some ways.\"\n\nHow does this make energy more expensive for regular Texans?\n\nThe cost of Bitcoin miners reselling electricity during peak demand falls on consumers, University of Houston energy economist Ed Hirs tells the Times. \"Ironically, when people are paying the most for their power, or losing it altogether, the miners are making money selling energy back to Texans at rates 100 times what they paid.\"\n\nThere's also a cost from the miners' enormous power consumption. Bitcoin miners say they set up camp in areas where they can use otherwise unusable renewable energy, but their energy needs are so great they actually get 85 percent of their energy from coal and natural gas plants, causing \"as much carbon pollution as adding 3.5 million gas-powered cars to America's roads,\" the Times reports, citing an analysis by tech nonprofit WattTime.\n\nThe 1,800 MW used by the 10 Bitcoin mines connected to the Texas grid require more expensive power generators to come online, and this \"increased demand has caused electric bills for power customers to rise nearly 5 percent, or $1.8 billion per year,\" the Times reports, citing a simulation performed by energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. \"In West Texas, where several Bitcoin mines have settled, bills have increased by nearly 9 percent.\"\n\nA group of seven federal lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), asked ERCOT about the state's cryptocurrency boom and power consumption last fall. \"Given the impacts of crypto-mining on the climate, the grid, and to ratepayers, ERCOT's support for this industry is irresponsible and highly concerning,\" they wrote.\n\n\"It's a massive financial burden to Texans,\" Wood Mackenzie's Ben Hertz-Shargel told the Times. And because of how the Texas market operates, the increases are steepest for residential customers. Riot, for example, told investors that due to its various strategies, it paid 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour last year. \"By comparison, the average price for other industrial businesses in Texas was 7.2 cents,\" the Times reports. \"For residents, it was 13.5 cents.\"\n\nWhat do Bitcoin proponents say?\n\nBitcoin miners and their supporters highlight the benefits they bring to rural communities and argue that their sizable energy usage will encourage the construction of more power plants, especially wind and solar generation that isn't yet able to circulate on the grid due to a lack of transmission lines. The Bitcoin companies also say the criticism of them is unjust.\n\nThe analysis cited by the Times \"could be used to attack any industry that consumes power,\" said David Fogel, the chief executive of Coinmint. \"I think the entire notion of singling out specific industries like this is unfair.\"\n\n\"The thing about crypto is that they're really not doing anything that is useful,\" counters Molly White, a software engineer and cryptocurrency researcher. \"It is primarily used for speculation. I think that's important to realize. And that is somehow worth the electricity usage of small countries? That blows my mind.\"\n\nIs Texas doing anything to addresses Bitcoin mining's power consumption?\n\nYes. The Texas Senate unanimously passed legislation in April that would cap Bitcoin miners' participation in ERCOT's demand response program at 10 percent, require them to shut down during peak demand anyway, and eliminate tax incentives \u2014 and the Bitcoin lobby is working hard to make sure it fails in the House. Bitcoin boosters are pushing a \"Don't Mess With Texas Innovation\" campaign aimed at stopping this \"anticompetitive\" bill, SB 1751.\n\nThe Texas Senate also sent the House a bill that aims to stabilize the power grid by building natural gas\u2013powered power plants that could generate up to 10 gigawatts of electricity in emergency situations. The Senate touted estimates that it would cost $10.8 billion to build the plants, but an estimate by the quasi-government Lower Colorado River Authority said it could cost $18 million. It isn't clear if the state would pay for the backup power generators with reserve funds or have ERCOT pass the costs onto energy customers.\n\nThe proposal, a priority for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) \"has many opponents,\" KUT Austin reports. \"Environmental groups are concerned with the amount of extra carbon dioxide-emitting fossil fuel generation it would lock into the state's energy mix. Existing power plant companies say it would destroy the Texas competitive energy market. Meanwhile, consumer advocates point out it would greatly increase already-rising Texas electricity bills.\"\n\nHow did Texas end up with all these Bitcoin mines in the first place?\n\nBasically, Texas invited Bitcoin miners in, and they accepted, drawn in by cheap energy and comparatively few regulations. They need to go somewhere. Bitcoin mines used to be centered in China, but due in part to the industry's massive energy consumption, Beijing declared crypto mining \"undesirable\" and banned it in 2021. Many miners moved to Iran and Kazakhstan, which also cracked down. Texas rolled out the red carpet.\n\n\"Texas will be the crypto leader,\" tweeted Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who also hosted the Texas Blockchain Council at the governor's mansion. ERCOT's former chief declared himself \"pro-Bitcoin.\" For the Bitcoin miners, \"the main attraction is cheap wholesale electricity prices,\" said UT's King.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency mining can operate from anywhere in the world,\" the Texas comptroller report noted. \"It is not bound by transportation networks or access to raw materials or a specialized workforce. What its data centers do require is a massive amount of electricity to cool and operate the mining machinery, and Texas provides an attractive draw for such needs.\" And if that ever changes, they can move on to somewhere else, leaving Texas with a whole lot more power."

        "title": "The Best Bitcoin Loan Platforms of 2023 - Blockworks",
        "content": "A bitcoin loan is money, property or goods lent to a borrower using BTC as collateral. It is the permabull\u2019s ultimate hack for using BTC without the FOMO and tax burden that comes with selling.\n\nAlthough the term \u201cbitcoin loan\u201d might be unclear to some, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the loan is made in bitcoin. It is only considered a bitcoin loan if the collateral backing the loan is denominated in BTC.\n\nAdditionally, these loans are overcollateralized, which means that the value of the collateralized bitcoin exceeds the loan\u2019s value. For instance, some lenders allow borrowers to borrow up to 50% of the deposited collateral\u2019s USD value. As with traditional loans, borrowers receive their collateral back once they pay off the loan and interest in full.\n\nSo, what is the point if borrowers get back less than what they put in? This article in our series on crypto and bitcoin loans will explain the appeal and the pros and cons of different bitcoin loan platforms.\n\nWhy get a bitcoin-backed loan?\n\nLike all loans, bitcoin-backed loans aim to make the inaccessible or illiquid value of something more accessible in an open market. Traditional lenders do this by making the value of your future work or endeavors available in cash or a line of credit.\n\nBitcoin is more liquid than future work but less accessible than a common medium of exchange. First, only a few merchants and sellers accept bitcoin as payment. But more importantly, because the IRS classifies bitcoin as property, you create a taxable event every time you sell it or exchange it.\n\nThirdly, if you view your BTC holdings as an investment, you want to wait to sell until you have made a return. And if you are a bitcoin permabull, you want to avoid selling BTC for as long as possible. So while bitcoin is considered more liquid than most assets such as property and stocks, it is still less liquid than the cash in your pocket.\n\nHow it saves money\n\nA bitcoin-backed loan makes a portion of that investment available without selling bitcoin, thus retaining any potential upside and avoiding a taxable event. There are many instances where this loan would save the borrower money and even make a profit off the initial investment.\n\nSuppose a borrower uses it to buy a house, flip a used car or even buy more bitcoin. In that case, they can use the investment proceeds to repay the loan without selling any collateral. This strategy is called a leveraged investment and always comes with a degree of risk. For example, if the price of bitcoin drops during the loan duration and the borrower cannot satisfy the collateral requirement, they could lose their initial investment. Borrowers amplify this risk when they use it to buy more bitcoin.\n\nBut if the second investment pays off and the price of bitcoin increases, an investor can pay off the borrowed amount without selling their collateral and paying capital gains. And if bitcoin doubled in price, the investor can avoid selling bitcoin to pay off the loan by using that collateral to take out another bitcoin loan. This process is called rolling your debt, and it can get risky if investors do not save enough capital on the side to account for price volatility.\n\nWhen is the best time to buy?\n\nThe best time to buy BTC used as collateral for a bitcoin loan is after a significant market drawdown. Bitcoin\u2019s historical chart reveals that the leading cryptocurrency has suffered severe pullbacks of over 80% after hitting a new all-time high in a bullish market cycle.\n\nBuying BTC close to a bear market bottom allows investors to maximize the benefits of a bitcoin loan while minimizing the risk of being margin called on their position. However, the difficulty in timing the bottom of a bear market means investors using bitcoin as collateral must be wary of a continued downtrend and hedge against such an outcome. A good rule of thumb is to over-collateralize so that an 80% drawdown from the most recent all-time high won\u2019t liquidate your collateral. Considering a move where the investor uses the credit line to acquire more bitcoin, their portfolio gains substantially as the market trends upwards following a market bottom.\n\nBenefits vs. risks\n\nA bitcoin-backed loan may be a no-brainer given BTC\u2019s historical performance and ability to recover from severe drawdowns. Yet, these loans come with risks that investors must recognize before using the option. This section discusses the benefits and risks when you borrow against BTC.\n\nBenefits\n\nInstant liquidity: Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset compared to other assets such as real estate, bonds, and stocks. A bitcoin loan allows investors to tap into bitcoin\u2019s highly liquid nature within same-day funding. Since loans are overcollateralized, most platforms do not subject users to credit checks and paper filings that could delay access to liquidity as with other financial assets.\n\nGreater returns: Since bitcoin loans allow investors to borrow money without spending their bitcoins, they can generate greater returns as the value of their collateral increases. For example, if the value of the collateral doubles, the investors can sell half of it to pay off the loan. This would still incur similar and possibly greater capital gains to selling the same amount of BTC prior to the loan. But in this case, the investor nets a greater profit because they avoided selling BTC at half the price.\n\nTax benefits: Bitcoin loans can save investors from the tax headaches associated with selling bitcoins to book profits or losses. The borrowing transaction is not a taxable event in most jurisdictions. Users do not need to file tax returns until they choose to sell the BTC collateral in the future.\n\nCollateral/token value: During severe market downturns, BTC historically records less volatility compared to other crypto assets. Thus, a loan backed by bitcoin can better weather market pullbacks while saving investors from platform risks associated with using altcoins as collateral.\n\nRisks\n\nCollateral liquidation: Investors risk losing their BTC collateral if the asset\u2019s price drops substantially below capital requirements. Failure to supply additional collateral upon a margin call will cause the bitcoin loan platform to liquidate deposited BTC to cover the borrowed amount. Bitcoin\u2019s volatile nature also means that such drops could happen quickly, catching investors off guard.\n\nTechnology risks: Blockchain technology and underpinning technologies such as smart contracts, cross-chain bridge protocols, and currency peg mechanisms are still in their infancy. Users risk losing funds to technology risks such as bugs and security breaches. Even simpler risks, such as transferring funds to the wrong addresses, could lead to permanent losses due to the irreversibility of blockchain transactions.\n\nThird-party risks: Investors take on several counterparty risks when they obtain bitcoin loans through a platform that requires the transfer of assets to the centralized entity. The platform could rehypothecate user deposits for personal interests or suffer a security breach. In some cases, the bitcoin loan platform is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning investors cannot pursue legal recourse in the event of a loss.\n\nHow does it work\n\nWhen borrowers take out a Bitcoin loan, they use their deposited bitcoins as collateral for the amount they borrow in fiat currency. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio sets the maximum USD value the borrower can borrow. Also, it determines the price at which the deposited assets may be sold to cover the borrowed amount.\n\nCustomers are incentivized to add more collateral to avoid an impending liquidation. For example, consider a user that deposits $1,000 worth of BTC with a 50% LTV. They can borrow up to 50% of the deposited amount, $500 in fiat USD or stablecoins. Assuming the bitcoin loan platform stipulates an 80% LTV threshold for liquidation, the user risks losing their BTC collateral if its value drops by 80% of the borrowed amount (which amounts to $400 in our example).\n\nBitcoin loan categories\n\nIrrespective of the model used to generate profit from loan issuance, bitcoin loan providers usually fall into two categories: decentralized and centralized platforms. The primary difference is in where the platform stores deposited bitcoins.\n\nDeFi protocols: Investors can borrow against BTC using DeFi protocols built on layer-2 bitcoin network solutions such as RSK, Stacks, Liquid and Fedimints. Users usually retain self-custody while lending or locking assets on autonomous protocols. Here are some popular options on each network.\n\nRSK \u2013 Sovryn, Tropykus\n\n\u2013 Sovryn, Tropykus Stacks \u2013 ALEX\n\n\u2013 ALEX Liquid \u2013 Lend at Hodl Hodl\n\n\u2013 Lend at Hodl Hodl Fedimints\n\nCeFi lenders: are centralized bitcoin loan issuers that hold custody over user assets. They typically require users to complete an identity verification process and may impose limits on user accounts. Popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Bitfinex are examples of CeFi lenders that offer bitcoin loan services.\n\nWhere to get a Bitcoin-backed loan\n\nInvestors can get a bitcoin-backed loan using any lending platform in this section. Readers must weigh the risks and benefits of each platform and choose one based on their portfolio size and investment objectives.\n\nPros Cons No tokenomics\n\nNo fractional reserve banking as all loans are backed 1:1\n\nNo derivatives product to drive irresponsible trading\n\nNo rehypothecation of user assets.\n\nNo yield product, which adds additional risk to the business.\n\nOn-chain proof of reserves via BitGo.\n\nEmail & SMS notifications if the threshold is in danger of being breached No self-custody solution yet\n\nManual application process and KYC requirements\n\nVerify 21 embraces the tried and tested model of bitcoin-only backed loans and narrows the main risks for the client down to the liquidation price of the loan and the custody of collateral. Clients maintain complete control over their LTV ratio as they may add or remove collateral to match their loan profile.\n\nMeanwhile, Verify 21 secures user funds by adopting cold wallets provided by leading custodian service BitGo and proof of reserves scheme to imbibe user trust. Verify 21\u2019s traditional approach poses minimal risks compared to DeFi lenders or centralized entities with a mix of tokenomics and yield generation activities. The company\u2019s business model is more similar to a traditional bank, giving people an extremely secure way to borrow, which does not exist in most parts of the world.\n\nPros Cons No interest rates.\n\nNon-custodial contracts handle loan issuance, repayment and liquidations.\n\nNo KYC requirements\n\nHigh collateralization and a Stability Pool mechanism lower the risk of loan default. Vulnerable to smart contract bugs\n\nUsers risk losing funds to an RBTC depeg.\n\nSovryn Zero is a decentralized trading and lending protocol built on Rootstock (RSK). This bitcoin sidechain relies on the legacy Bitcoin network for security. Users must bridge BTC to RBTC (a pegged version of Bitcoin on RSK) to access the Sovryn Zero protocol and borrow against BTC.\n\nSovryn Zero requires a 110% over-collateralization for loans, meaning users must always hold a BTC amount higher than they borrow. The protocol issues loans in its ZUSD stablecoin, which users can convert to cash or RBTC after paying the loan origination fee. While Sovryn features an SOV token used for protocol governance, users must not hold them to access Bitcoin loans.\n\nPros Cons No interest rates or origination fees\n\nLightning Network support for BTC deposits\n\nThe platform is non-custodial, meaning users can automatically redeem their capital by repaying their loan.\n\nNo rehypothecation as funds are managed on-chain via smart contracts LBTC and the addition of synthetic assets impose a depeg risk.\n\nUsers also run the risk of oracle manipulation and smart contract bugs\n\nFuji Finance is a decentralized and non-custodial protocol built on the layer-2 Bitcoin network, Liquid. Fuji enables users to lock Liquid BTC (LBTC) \u2013 a version of bitcoin on the Liquid network \u2013 as collateral to borrow synthetic assets such as its FUSD stablecoin, stocks, and bonds. The platform mints $1 in FUSD for every $1.5 in BTC deposited, ensuring an over-collateralization of user deposits.\n\nFuji charges a fixed 0.25% fee on loan repayments but no interest rate or loan origination fees. There is no time limit for repayments. The platform also supports Lightning Network deposits, making fast deposits and withdrawals convenient.\n\nPros Cons Non-custodial access as users hold keys to escrowed funds.\n\nNo KYC requirementsInvestors have greater flexibility on loan offersSupports USD withdrawal via multiple stablecoins Interest rates on stablecoin borrowing is higher compared to other bitcoin loan platforms\n\nHodl Hodl is a non-custodial and peer-to-peer focused cryptocurrency protocol built on Liquid Network. Hodl Hodl offers a unique lending product for users to borrow against BTC in a peer-to-peer fashion. Investors can browse a list of Open Borrow offers or create a new borrowing request with their preferred terms, such as loan duration, interest rate, asset, etc.\n\nHodl Hodl matches user requests by having the lender and borrower transfer their assets to a multisig address. The borrower commits to repaying the loan and interest within the agreed timeline to receive their BTC held as collateral. They risk liquidation if the position falls below an agreed LTV threshold or they fail to repay the loan within the timeline.\n\nPros Cons No tokenomics\n\nNo rehypothecation of user deposits\n\nTransparent fees and repayment schedule\n\nOn-chain proof of reservesIdeal for institutional borrowers with high liquidity demands.\n\nLive client support team Manual approval process\n\nHigh-interest rate on USD borrows\n\nUnchained capital is a popular crypto financial services company that offers bitcoin-backed loans alongside its products. Users can access bitcoin loans on Unchained by completing an online application and signing the contracts upon receiving a loan offer from the company.\n\nUnchained capital requires users to pay monthly interest on the loans during its duration, with the principal due to be repaid at the end of the period (usually 6 or 12 months). Users receive a unique address on the blockchain to monitor their collateral and can redeem them upon complete repayment of the loan.\n\nPros Cons Non-custodial access to bitcoin loans\n\nBorrowers are subject to rigorous checks to lower the possibility of defaults\n\nAudited smart contracts\n\nZest Protocol provides user support via its Discord community. Yield generation activities mean greater risk for lenders.\n\nInvestors risk losing collateral to an sBTC depeg.\n\nZest Protocol brands itself as the first on-chain bitcoin capital market for institutional borrowers. Zest is built on the Stacks blockchain and provides access to bitcoin loans through a liquidity pool seeded by lenders seeking yield on BTC. Lenders receive periodic payouts (between 4-7%) APY for providing liquidity.\n\nInvestors must convert BTC to sBTC (Stacks pegged bitcoin version) to interact with the Zest Protocol. At the time of writing, Zest Protocol is available in early access following the completion of security audits and the testnet phase.\n\nPros Cons Secure storage of user funds using industry-standard practice.\n\nCoinbase offers a competitive 8% interest rate of USD borrows\n\nOnly interest payment is mandated during loan durationInvestors can borrow anywhere between $100,000 to $1,000,000 depending on their portfolio size Users can only borrow up to 30% of deposited BTC Lack of self-custody\n\nPopular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase offers a bitcoin loan service, allowing users to borrow up to 40% of their collateral amount in USD. Users can instantly withdraw the credit line via PayPal or ACH wire transfers.\n\nCoinbase loan users may opt for a 12-month fixed term with the option to pay only the interest rate during the loan duration ($10 minimum). They can also extend the fixed term for 12 months, with full repayment only mandatory at the end of the tenure.\n\nMaking the most of bitcoin loans\n\nIn conclusion, bitcoin loans offer a promising way for investors to increase their BTC holdings, acquire new assets, or address cash flow needs while maintaining their investment\u2019s potential upside. However, the permabull mindset and dogma that bitcoin will only ever continue to increase in price can lead many to take extreme risks with these financial instruments. Even if bitcoin wins the world over as the supreme reserve asset for nation states, its volatile price swings can still leave many bitcoin backed loan borrowers out to dry. Users must understand the risks and thoroughly research before selecting a bitcoin loan platform.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "This analysis is by Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Market Structure Analyst Jamie Douglas Coutts. It appeared first on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nWith debt levels at extremes and monetary debasement unlikely to slow in coming years, investors may start to view Bitcoin as a suitable portfolio asset \u2014 most likely at the expense of a small portion of fixed-income allocations.\n\nDebasement undercutting asset returns\n\nThe problem with measuring nominal returns of assets is that it obfuscates debasement by monetary inflation. In a fiat system, the monetary base via private credit and central-bank balance sheets must continually expand to ensure the nominal value of collateral backing debt in the system also rises. Sustained periods of nominal price declines (deflation) would ultimately collapse the entire system."

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining & Rural Missouri: An Electrifying Future - The Missouri Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin Mining & Rural Missouri: An Electrifying Future\n\nWhile many have heard of Bitcoin, few understand Bitcoin mining and its relevance in the world. Bitcoin mining is a vibrant, growing, worldwide competitive data processing business that is here to stay, and Missouri sits on a golden opportunity to attract digital gold miners to the Show-Me State.\n\nBitcoin mining is thousands of specialized computers called ASICs, competing to find the solution to cryptographic hashes in a race repeated every 10 minutes. This process is called Proof of Work (PoW). The winner of each race gets to construct the block that holds all transactions on the network for that period, rewarded with Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes the Bitcoin network pays 6.25 Bitcoin valued at ~$190,000 USD to miners.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s hashing power continues to rise to new highs, Bitcoin miners seek low cost energy to add processing power to the network. Key to Bitcoin mining competitiveness is electricity cost, the only controllable variable expense. The Bitcoin network incentivizes miners to be good actors, requiring significant investment in hardware and electrical infrastructure used by machines for the Proof of Work process.\n\nElectricity is the largest production expense, and data centers, with dozens, hundreds, sometimes thousands of computers, run continuously every day. Therein, lies opportunity for rural Missouri. Traditional data centers are usually in urban areas with high bandwidth network access to carry data. Bitcoin miners prioritize lowest energy rates wherever those opportunities exist. Not for profit, rural Missouri co-ops keep costs low and profit above operating costs is returned to members.\n\nWhile rural Missouri enjoys low industrial electricity rates, there is opportunity for efficiency improvements. In winter, people run high energy devices like electric furnaces, adding demand to the electrical grid. This is called peak demand and happens only a few days of the year. Power generating plants must forecast this peak demand and cooperatives are charged for the year based on the previous year peak. Put simply, they are charged for electricity demand that only exists for a small portion of the year.\n\nThe golden opportunity is to invite Bitcoin miners to build data centers where these peak demand imbalances occur and sell them low-cost electricity. Attractive to miners, lowest energy costs will be optimized, adding an additional revenue stream to co-ops. When peaks happen, Bitcoin miners can switch off their computers on demand and immediately free up the electricity for other uses. When the peak event passes, the miners come back online.\n\nSummary\n\nRural coops can recover power \u201clost\u2019 because of peaks and rural Missouri Bitcoin miners can be competitive with lower energy costs. Mining opportunities create jobs, pour money into rural economies and tax revenues to the state. Utilizing power already purchased and wasted, Bitcoin mining can provide tremendous value to rural electric cooperatives throughout the state."

        "content": "The chill of Crypto Winter and the contagion of FTX, the now-bankrupt exchange, felled a series of crypto lenders in 2022. Unchained Capital, a Bitcoin financial services firm that lets customers put up Bitcoin as collateral for loans, is not one of them.\n\nThe company, which also provides Bitcoin custodial services, allows customers to buy Bitcoin, and has a Bitcoin IRA product, announced on Tuesday that it had raised $60 million in a Series B funding round led by Valor Equity Partners.\n\nOther investors include NYDIG, Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital, and Highland Capital Partners. A spokesperson for Unchained declined to provide the company\u2019s implied valuation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to show how, if you do it right, cryptocurrency lending is not like the Wild West of broken promises,\u201d Dhruv Bansal, cofounder and chief strategy officer at Unchained, told Fortune in an interview.\n\nThe firm\u2019s funding announcement is rare in a landscape where, in less than a year, a suite of crypto lenders once valued in the billions, including Voyager, Celsius, and BlockFi, declared bankruptcy as the bottom fell out of the crypto bull market in 2022.\n\n\u201cParticularly in lending, [Unchained] has differentiated itself by minimizing risk to both the lender and the borrower,\u201d Vivek Pattipati, a partner at Valor Equity who also will be joining Unchained\u2019s board, said in a statement.\n\nFounded by Bansal and CEO Joe Kelly in 2017, Unchained originally began as a Bitcoin custodial firm where users\u2019 cryptocurrency was kept in \u201ccold\u201d storage, or on a hard drive not connected to the internet. As opposed to other crypto custodians, it has what it calls \u201ccollaborative custody,\u201d or a system in which Unchained can\u2019t access customers\u2019 Bitcoin without explicit permission.\n\nWhen Unchained launched a lending product where customers could secure cash if they offer up Bitcoin as collateral, it continued its cautious approach to deposits. Their \u201ccollaborative custody\u201d system, cofounders Bansal and Kelly say, prevents rehypothecation, or when firms use customers\u2019 collateral to give out loans, make investments, or pay out interest. This strategy can help financial institutions reap outsize rewards, or in the case of Lehman Brothers during the Great Recession, fail precipitously.\n\nWhile Voyager, Celsius, and BlockFi collapsed for myriad reasons, each firm repurposed customer collateral, according to their websites and public documents. \u201cHistorically, that\u2019s what our industry does,\u201d Bansal, in reference to rehypothecation, told Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019re contrarian. That\u2019s not what we do.\u201d\n\nWith their new injection of capital, Bansal and Kelly say that they\u2019re looking to expand Unchained beyond Bitcoin custody, trading, IRAs, and lending to mirror the offerings of a traditional financial services provider. That means, for example, exploring the possibility of creating checking and savings accounts for customers. Bansal and Kelly are also looking to add to their current team of 87 employees in a \u201cdisciplined manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of just being a Bitcoin company,\u201d Bansal told Fortune, \u201cwe\u2019re growing into a broader financial services company.\u201d"

        "title": "Is MicroStrategy a Bitcoin Proxy for Institutions? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "If you\u2019re an institutional investor with an interest in bitcoin, but you are either restricted from or simply hesitant about buying the digital currency directly, then what are your options? Looking at recent events, it appears that an alternative path by which you can increase your exposure to bitcoin, without actually holding any bitcoin, is by increasing your exposure to MicroStrategy instead.\n\nWhy Is MicroStrategy Synonymous With Bitcoin?\n\nBack in August 2020, the Co-Founder and then-CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, signaled through the company\u2019s first purchase of $250 million worth of bitcoin that he was taking the cryptocurrency seriously. For Saylor, not only was bitcoin a deeply important financial innovation, but it had become the most efficient and effective means of storing wealth.\n\nAnd, this wasn\u2019t to be a partial move, as Saylor then decisively went about the task of making bitcoin the primary treasury reserve asset at MicroStrategy. Thus, since 2020, the company has acquired 140,000 BTC at an average cost of $29,803 per coin.\n\nFurthermore, Saylor has become one of the most prominent public advocates for bitcoin, its utility, and the conviction that it will, in time, become the strongest asset in existence.\n\nKeep Reading Nigeria Presses Binance amid Economic Turmoil and Detains Executives\n\nIn this capacity, Michael Saylor has delivered countless interviews on platforms, ranging from crypto-native niche podcasts to mainstream channels, such as CNBC and Fox News. Additionally, he changed his position within MicroStrategy, becoming the Executive Chairman in August 2022, and announcing at the time that he would \u201cbe able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s latest bitcoin acquisition came at the beginning of this month, with an announcement that it had purchased another 1,045 coins, at an average price of $28,016 per coin.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 1,045 #bitcoin for ~ $29.3M at an average price of $28,016 per bitcoin. As of 4/4/2023 @MicroStrategy holds 140,000 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.17 billion at an average price of $29,803 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/IBufTxalnv \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) April 5, 2023\n\nInstitutions Increase Exposure to MicroStrategy\n\nAs MicroStrategy is now well known for its bitcoin holdings, and Michael Saylor has taken on a role involving bitcoin advocacy, any increases in institutional ownership of MicroStrategy shares are notable as possible indicators of wider interest in bitcoin.\n\nYear-to-date reports show that in Q1 of this year, institutional ownership of MicroStrategy shares increased 121%, and that figure includes some sudden increases in exposure by major entities, with the biggest purchases coming from Bank of America, which increased its holdings by almost $60 million, followed by Capital Group and Fidelity Investments.\n\nBank of America is now the fourth largest MicroStrategy shareholder, behind Capital, Vanguard and BlackRock, with Vanguard and BlackRock also increasing their holdings.\n\nMicroStrategy as a Bitcoin Proxy\n\nAs observed, MicroStrategy has, seemingly deliberately, become synonymous with bitcoin, and now holds an amount approaching 0.7% of the total bitcoin that can ever exist (the future total supply is capped at 21 million).\n\nWith no spot bitcoin ETF currently approved in the US, if a large entity is interested in the leading cryptocurrency but wants to avoid directly buying and taking custody with all the logistical complications and attention that would involve, then it would be logical to explore other routes towards gaining exposure. And, buying shares in MicroStrategy presents an easily executable, indirect option. Simply put, exposure to MicroStrategy equates to exposure to bitcoin.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, these increases in exposure to MicroStrategy and its digital treasury came immediately after the crypto bear market appears to have bottomed out. Moving on from 2022's downward bleed, which culminated in the collapse of FTX, the new year has subsequently brought what looks like a change in bitcoin\u2019s trend structure on the price charts, and the digital currency has hugely outperformed other asset classes since the beginning of 2023.\n\nIt appears, then, that at this juncture in bitcoin\u2019s history, when the asset\u2019s presence has come to look solidly resilient but American regulatory bodies are still reluctant to fully open the doors, MicroStrategy is acting as a temporary bitcoin proxy and functioning almost as a makeshift bitcoin ETF.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s notable that this should be occurring, along with a rally in bitcoin\u2019s price to volley it back over $30,000, during a period US authorities have been taking explicit aim at crypto platforms, such as Coinbase, Kraken and Binance, and after crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank ran into fatal problems.\n\nVeteran bitcoin advocates will tell you that none of these events is a reflection on the value of bitcoin itself, but rather, are the result of other cryptocurrencies being classifiable as unregistered securities, or, in some cases, due to mismanagement at particular crypto companies, exchanges, and banks.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin (as distinct from crypto, or the crypto industry) continues to operate reliably, as it has since its inception. And, it seems now that institutions may be not only picking up on that message but looking to act on it through whichever avenues currently happen to be the most expedient."

        "content": "Billionaire investor Howard Marks has warmed up to crypto, and especially bitcoin, over the past few years.\n\nIn a recent podcast appearance, he recalled his January 2021 memo to Oaktree Capital Management clients titled \u201cSomething of Value,\u201d in which Marks concluded he was \u201cnot yet informed enough to form a view on cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThat was a stark departure from 4 years prior, when Marks\u2019 memorialized thoughts on crypto that played up the speculative mania, calling it \u201cnothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme).\u201d\n\nA series of discussions with his adult son Andrew during the pandemic \u2014 or, as Marks calls it, \u201cmy time in captivity\u201d \u2014 softened his view.\n\n\u201cOur families lived together for three months, and we had some great discussions, as you can imagine,\u201d Marks told We Study Billionaires\u2019 Trey Lockerbie. \u201cAnd it was around April\u2026when Andrew told me he had bought bitcoin,\u201d for between $5,000 and $6,000.\n\nAndrew Marks is the co-managing partner of TQ Ventures, a technology-focused venture capital firm, who has described himself as a huge Buffet nerd, but one who became more open-minded toward tech investments.\n\nHoward Marks characterized his own investing style as \u201ccautious\u201d and remarked on his tendency to be \u201cdeeply dubious when we hear \u2018this time it\u2019s different.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe point to a history of speculative manias and financial innovations that\u2019s left behind significant carnage. It\u2019s this skepticism that reduces the value investor\u2019s probability of losing money,\u201d he said.\n\nA sea change\n\nSo, what\u2019s changed?\n\nA macro-driven sea change is in process, Marks said, calling the 40-year decline in interest rates \u201cthe biggest single event of the last 45 years in the financial world.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the frog in the pot of water,\u201d the gradual decline in interest rates, \u201cwere responsible for the majority of all the money that\u2019s been made in the last 45 years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to leave interest rates at zero for the 7 years following the global financial crisis of 2008 was a mistake, in Marks\u2019 view. Now interest rates are \u201cgoing to kind of hang around at this level\u201d \u2014 but not go up.\n\nMarks even expects the Fed will cut rates in 2024, though it won\u2019t be by much. \u201cThey\u2019re through coming down in any major way,\u201d he added, and \u201cthey\u2019re through being ultra-low.\u201d\n\nMarks praised current Fed Chair Jerome Powell as \u201creasoned,\u201d but \u201cresolute,\u201d in setting expectations for inflation, which Marks predicted \u201cwill abate naturally,\u201d unlike the far worse scenario the country faced in the 1970s.\n\nBitcoin is a product of a loss of trust in the financial system, especially for people in countries with weak institutions and limited access to financial services, he now concludes.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t exactly want everybody in authority to know how much money they have. So it does seem that there are good uses for some coins, and bitcoin seems to be so far the one in the lead.\u201d\n\nCloser to home, bitcoin\u2019s rally is fueled by the recent banking crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an anti-bank play, and the weakness of the bank shows up the strength of bitcoin, and it\u2019s done very, very well this year,\u201d Marks said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Hayek and Bitcoin | AIER - AIER - Daily Economy News",
        "content": "The late economist FA Hayek had a great deal to say about private money, inflation, and indeed, about preserving individual freedoms against a tyrannical state. As we approach the 15th anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper and the currency\u2019s release shortly thereafter, it is worthwhile to reflect on what Hayek might have thought about this technological breakthrough.\n\nIn October 2008, the pseudonymous character Satoshi Nakamoto announced that he had published a paper explaining how a peer-to-peer \u201celectronic cash system\u201d could work \u201cwith no trusted third party.\u201d In January the next year, he launched Bitcoin with mention of an article in the British newspaper The Times: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d What was implied was that the release of this peer-to-peer electronic cash system was a response to the cronyism he saw in central banking during the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nUnfortunately, Hayek passed long before Bitcoin\u2019s inception, but in his book The Denationalisation of Money, he argued for nothing short of stripping the state of its monopoly power of money itself. Beyond this, Hayek imagined an economic system in which \u201cseveral concurrent, distinct kinds of money are simultaneously in use in the same territory.\u201d As such, if Bitcoin had been around during Hayek\u2019s lifetime, he likely would not have advocated (as many bitcoiners do) to \u201cbitcoinize everything,\u201d precisely because a single money existing everywhere was hardly what he had in mind. Hayek wanted competition in money.\n\nSly and unstoppable\n\nHayek certainly would have appreciated Bitcoin\u2019s unwavering resistance to political pressure. But, above all, I like to think that Hayek would have appreciated Bitcoin for at least two other important reasons: it is both sly, and nearly impossible to stop. In a 1984 interview, Hayek stated that:\n\nI don\u2019t believe we shall ever have good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government. If we can\u2019t take it violently out of the hands of government, [then] all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can\u2019t stop.\n\nThe key to the \u201csly roundabout way\u201d that Satoshi put together (having borrowed from those before him) was that Bitcoin was merely a protocol \u2013 a TCP/IP of money \u2013 one that quickly became highly decentralized, meaning that no parties would be capable of controlling it for their own benefit. And by being an internet-native digital asset, there would be no centralized point of failure in the real world, with tangible, backed assets that could be seized to shut the whole thing down (as happened to at least two asset-backed, privately issued digital currencies before Bitcoin).\n\nBitcoin and gold\n\nSatoshi sought to imitate gold, albeit in the digital world. In the Bitcoin whitepaper, he wrote that \u201cThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation\u2026 [although in] our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\u201d So what did Hayek think about gold?\n\nHayek wrote that if gold were to remain in the hands of government, that he considered this metallic standard to be \u201cthe only tolerably safe system.\u201d But gold also stood only as \u201ca very wobbly anchor\u201d to protect against \u201crisks of fraud by government\u201d and \u201cwould never be as good a money as one issued by an agency whose whole business rested on its success in providing a money the public preferred to other kinds.\u201d\n\nHayek also argued that gold gave us a \u201csemi-automatic regulation of the quantity of money\u201d (something he viewed favorably), but he may have also found interesting the idea of an impenetrable algorithmic monetary policy, which Bitcoin provides.\n\nWhat Hayek considered to be a better money than gold was his own proposal for a money issued by banks under a state of competition in money, and backed by real assets. Economist Lawrence H. White, however, rightly distinguishes between \u201cHayek\u2019s proposal\u2014to allow free choice and private competition in currency\u2014from his prediction about what type of money would then dominate the field.\u201d\n\nHayek also believed that the public was likely to prefer a money \u201cwhose purchasing power it could expect to be stable.\u201d Such a stable purchasing power in money, he wrote, would reduce the strain on debtor-creditor relations (a subject that Hayek covers in detail in his book).\n\nWhite argues in his own new book Better Money: Gold, Fiat or Bitcoin? that a rise in purchasing power in gold instigates (through the profit motive) a response to produce more gold \u201cuntil purchasing power returns to trend.\u201d By contrast, as a similar rise in purchasing power for Bitcoin cannot provoke a similar increase in the supply of bitcoins beyond the protocol\u2019s fixed, coded supply schedule, there are \u201cno expectations of [mean] reversion to dampen volatility.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether Bitcoin\u2019s purchasing power will stabilize over time sufficiently for it to become a commonly used medium of exchange is a topic of ongoing heated debate. From my point of view, what Bitcoin sacrifices in terms of stable purchasing power by being unresponsive to increases in demand, it makes up for enormously elsewhere as a superior rules-based monetary system, neither subject to human discretion of central planners nor to miners that may wish to create more units than its supply schedule is programmed to create. This is precisely why the masses may inevitably adopt it (whenever their governments are incapable or uninterested in deterring them from doing so), not only as a store of value but also as a medium of exchange. And by having an internet-native digital asset that does not respond to external forces for its supply, we achieve a radically decentralized money, unprecedented in human history.\n\nAdditionally, enough of Bitcoin\u2019s users don\u2019t seem to mind the volatility enough to abandon it, and its widespread use keeps growing: both on-chain and on its so-called second layer. And, in fact, the present crackdown against it \u2013 especially in the United States and Europe \u2013 as well as the rush to implement CBDCs around the world, each suggest that regulators are worried about just how powerful it is.\n\nSo, would Hayek like Bitcoin? I never knew Hayek, but I think he would have loved what it represented as well as the extent to which it takes money out of the hands of the state (as people around the world transact peer-to-peer, permissionlessly, with this stateless digital asset). Bitcoin is that sly, roundabout way that they might never stop. Oh, and remember Satoshi\u2019s mention of The Times article about bank bailouts? By seemingly enormous coincidence, Satoshi (assuming he was unaware at the time), would have probably been delighted to learn that in Hayek\u2019s same \u201csly roundabout way\u201d video interview, he held up a copy of The Times newspaper and declared: \u201cI read this everyday.\u201d Great minds think alike."

        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nCryptocurrencies fell on Monday as investors put excitement from Ethereum's \"Shapella\" upgrade behind them and refocused on upcoming bank earnings and recession concerns.\n\nBitcoin fell more than 3.3% to $29,478.54, according to Coin Metrics, falling below the key $30,000 it hit last week for the first time since June. Meanwhile, ether was lower by 2.4% but maintained the $2,000 it broke through last week.\n\nCrypto is coming off a winning week in which prices were boosted by optimism around Ethereum's latest tech upgrade, dubbed \"Shapella\" (also known as \"Shanghai\"). The update is meant to bring greater liquidity to the network by allowing \"locked up\" ether to be withdrawn and ultimately draw in more institutional interest in the long term. Bitcoin and ether advanced 8% and 12%, respectively, for the week.\n\nThis week, it wouldn't be surprising to see a small correction in prices, according to Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank, and there could be some selling pressure as some investors may want to take profits from the previous week.\n\nWhile crypto was rallying, \"Friday's U.S. stock market showed unstable movements as stronger-than-expected consumer sentiment and Fed's Waller's speech strengthened the possibility of another rate hike in May,\" Hasegawa said. \"Nevertheless, the Fed Funds futures market has already priced in more than 80% chance of a 25bp hike in May, so pressures from macro factors on the price of bitcoin is expected to be limited.\"\n\nCrypto investors are watching bank earnings this week for more insight about the health of the sector and possibility of a coming recession. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week too.\n\n\"We haven't seen crypto perform in a high-rate, slowing growth environment until now,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investing company eToro. \"It's anyone's guess how crypto acts during a recession.\"\n\nFor this week, any downside potential \"should not be severe\" or keep bitcoin from continuing on its uptrend, Hasegawa said."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency ecosystem has enjoyed a buoyant start to the year as Bitcoin (BTC) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols surge in market capitalization through the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThese are the key takeaways from the \u201c2023 Q1 Crypto Industry Report\u201d published by CoinGecko on April 18. BTC emerged as the best-performing asset of Q1 2023, with gains of 72.4%, outperforming the likes of the Nasdaq index and gold, which marked 15.7% and 8.4% gains, respectively.\n\nThe report highlights that all major asset classes saw gains through the first quarter of the year, barring crude oil, which dropped by 6.1%. This decline was attributed to United States inflation data, which cited a reduction in oil demand and the ill effects of the U.S. banking crisis.\n\nBitcoin has been the best-performing asset through the first three months of 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe wider cryptocurrency markets have enjoyed a quarter of resurgence, with the overall market capitalization reaching $1.2 trillion at the end of Q1. CoinGecko highlights a 48.9%, $406 billion gain from the cryptocurrency market cap of $829 billion at the end of 2022.\n\nThe DeFi space was another standout performer, rising by $29.6 billion in value through the first quarter. The report cites the impressive performance of liquid staking governance tokens, which saw a 210% increase in market cap since the start of 2023.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade played a major role in driving the increase of capital flows into liquid staking pools, with the network\u2019s upgrade finally unlocking ETH staking reward withdrawals. The report notes that liquid staking is now the third-largest category in the DeFi sector.\n\nRelated: Ether hits 11-month high as post-Shapella withdrawals pass 1M ETH\n\nWhile Bitcoin and DeFi have been major movers thus far this year, the top 15 stablecoins saw their market cap drop by $6.2 billion. CoinGecko attributes this 4.5% drop in market cap to the shutdown of Binance USD (BUSD) by Paxos and the temporary depeg of USD Coin (USDC) during the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.\n\nTether (USDT) strengthened its position as the largest stablecoin by market cap in 2023, adding $13.6 billion since the start of the year, while USDC and BUSD recorded market cap losses of 26.9% and 54.5%, respectively.\n\nNonfungible token trading volume has also surged again in 2023, marking a 68% rise from Q4 2022 to $4.5 billion during the first quarter of 2023. NFT marketplace newcomer Blur accounted for the majority of NFT trading volume since its launch in October 2022, accounting for 71.8% of the market share in March 2023.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

Ether also stalled after strong gains that followed last week\u2019s upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower, with the exception of Solana, the BNB token of the Binance exchange, and Litecoin. U.S. equity futures moved higher after gains last week, though they lost some steam on Friday amid a mixed outlook for the economy.\n\nSee related article: Kraken to withdraw US$1.17 bln of staked Ether in line with SEC ruling, settlement\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin fell 1.47% to US$29,858 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but is still up 5.13% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token briefly breached the US$31,000 mark on Friday but then fluctuated above US$30,000 over the weekend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s gains last week came amid optimism around the Ethereum upgrade and signs of a slowdown in U.S. inflation in March. Lower inflation usually encourages buying of risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, said Marat Minkin, co-founder of decentralized finance payment app TONBanking. Cathy Wood, the CEO of investment manager Ark Invest, said on Friday that uncertainty about the outlook for the U.S. economy is also driving the safe-haven message around cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum dipped 0.40% to US$2,082. The token is up about 12% for the past seven days, which included Wednesday\u2019s Shanghai upgrade that allows investors to withdraw their staked Ether. As of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, over 992,000 Ether had been withdrawn since Wednesday, while withdrawal of another 897,000 Ether are pending, according to data from Token Unlocks. Both amounts make up about 10% of the total 17 million staked Ether.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB led the winners and rose 3.07% to US$343.33, with a weekly gain of 9.79%. The world\u2019s largest crypto exchange announced on Friday a partnership with the Brazilian Football Confederation to launch the first non-fungible token (NFT) of the country\u2019s national football league.\n\nSolana gained 3.01% to US$24.91, posting a weekly jump of 22.63%.

Solana Labs also entered a partnership with U.S.-based drink retailer Boba Guys for on-chain loyalty reward program\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.76% in the past 24 hours to US$1.26 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 13.46% to US$38.86 billion.\n\nIn the NFT market, the Forkast 500 NFT index added 0.91% to 4,053.99 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 2.98% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nU.S. stock futures edged up as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.19%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.17% and the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.01% higher.\n\nThe three indexes dipped Friday, though all logged gains for the week, as U.S. economic data sent mixed information to investors on what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates at its next meeting on May 3. Consumer sentiment ticked up in April, according to a report on Friday, while retail sales fell in March, both readings that suggest inflation is cooling.\n\nHowever, first-quarter earnings of major banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co, beat expectations, suggesting a stronger economy that may feed inflation, according to a Reuters report on Friday.\n\nU.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006, and analysts at the CME Group now see a 17.9% chance the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 3, while 82.1% predict a 25-basis-point rate hike,up from 66.5% last Friday.\n\nSee related article: Forkast NFT indexes reveal the hidden costs of y00ts, DeGods\u2019 moves across blockchains"

        "content": "Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency, introduced in 2009 to provide individuals and institutions with an alternative to cash payments and an investment opportunity for those looking to avoid the banking system in the wake of the 2008 global financial collapse. While adoption was slow in the early years, its popularity has boomed in the last seven years.\n\nIn March 2015, there were just over three million Bitcoin wallets; by November 2022, there were more than 85 million worldwide \u2014 an increase of nearly 30x. Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, can be a polarizing topic for financial experts and novices alike. Many still believe in the traditional legacy financial system of stocks and bonds, but Bitcoin has grown to a point where some professional athletes are taking multi-million-dollar contracts in Bitcoin instead of a check.\n\nIn short, Bitcoin has become much more than its original intent in Satoshi\u2019s 2008 whitepaper. Below, I\u2019ll discuss what Bitcoin means now and the value it holds for investors at every level.\n\nThe value of decentralization\n\nBitcoin\u2019s core value and most significant characteristic are that no person can control it independently. Because the rules of the original Bitcoin whitepaper written in 2008 cannot be edited, it is considered the most decentralized digital currency. Users and developers can propose changes but cannot force the nodes that run the software to adopt them.\n\nAlso written into the Bitcoin code as a distinctive characteristic is a \u201chard cap\u201d \u2014 or limit \u2014 on the number of Bitcoins that can ever exist, which is 21 million. Bitcoin can also never be controlled by one single entity, unlike fiat currencies in developed countries where the government can control the amount distributed to the open market. This lends a tremendous \u201cstore of value\u201d for Bitcoin, defined as \u201can asset, commodity, or currency that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged in the future without deteriorating in value.\u201d\n\nIn underdeveloped countries, where currency volatility is higher than in developed economies, Bitcoin has a much more significant impact than a typical store of value. For example, Bitcoin is considered legal tender in El Salvador and the Central African Republic. Bitcoin\u2019s unique decentralized nature could help preserve its value even in the future. Because of that core value, Bitcoin may become more utilized than a store of value in many different areas.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin\n\nFor the near future, Bitcoin will likely co-exist, as it has for years, with traditional financial systems to help offset the pain points of fiat currencies. While fiat currencies offer economic stability, growth potential and ubiquity in international trade, they are rife with issues. Fiat currencies are susceptible to inflation, reliant on government stability and have significant fees for withdrawals and transfers. This is where Bitcoin offers an attractive alternative because no one entity can control its characteristics.\n\nAt the same time, a double-edged sword exists: governments are more likely to intervene to suppress Bitcoin activity to support traditional financial markets and control the number of currencies in circulation. Since there is no central governing authority for Bitcoin, it is much more susceptible to the whims of financial regulators in some jurisdictions. As Bitcoin continues to exist alongside traditional currencies and attempts to operate within the legacy financial system, it will be affected by market factors and competition. For example, the crypto winter of 2022 significantly impacted Bitcoin prices, as its value dropped 65% from November 2021 to September 2022.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of Bitcoin, as opposed to more modern blockchain-based currencies, is its slower rate of technical growth and processing speeds. As the original cryptocurrency with such massive global usage, the system lacks scalability. Another issue that Bitcoin faces is that competitors continue to expand their use cases. Ethereum continues to grow its impact beyond strict cryptocurrency transactions via its ability to enable smart contracts.\n\nGovernment regulation can also serve as a roadblock, slowing down speeds and limiting the reach of rapidly growing industries. Governments are stuck in the middle of wanting to curb the illegal use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies while not completely halting the growth of a lucrative industry that has positively impacted countless lives.\n\nGeorgetown University professor Linda Jeng recently told the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs that a lack of a digital asset regulatory foundation puts American businesses, consumers and the economy as a whole at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d relative to other nations. This is a problem that doesn\u2019t only face the United States. But, when the regulations are implemented and have time to take effect, they can work as a foundation for a thriving modern digital currency industry.\n\nBitcoin remains king\n\nNo system is perfect, and despite its faults and the threat of regulation, Bitcoin remains as a worthy option for a potential investment. While the crypto winter caused many people to shy away, it\u2019s not apparent that there is a direct correlation between the selloff and Bitcoin\u2019s long-term viability. Rather, Bitcoin offers a trustless alternative to the moral hazard and eroding trust surrounding traditional banking.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has produced fairly consistent profits for mid- to long-term investment. This shows little signs of changings. As investment in and popularity of decentralized technologies continues to grow, Bitcoin could continue to exceed the original scope and expectations outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto 15 years ago.\n\nThe information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

        "content": "Michael Ghen, the leader of DeFi Philly, talks decentralized finance and blockchain technology at a meet up in Northern Liberties. Read more\n\nAt age 73, Yoav Zohar is an outlier among the Millennials and Gen Z who make up most of the cryptocurrency community.\n\nWhile many were still in grade school, Zohar learned about the booms and busts of new technology during the dot-com explosion of the early 2000s.\n\nSo when it comes to crypto \u2014 digital money that isn\u2019t tied to a central bank \u2014 Zohar won\u2019t hold more than $5 worth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to invest in it, because I think my money\u2019s more important than doing experiments,\u201d laughed Zohar at DeFi Philly, a meeting for decentralized finance enthusiasts in Northern Liberties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf 2022 was any indicator, his prudence paid off.\n\nIt was a particularly brutal year for Bitcoin, which swelled in valuation last spring before plummeting in May. What would follow was blow after blow for the highly volatile industry.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: South Philadelphia crypto company hit with more lawsuits, detailing a pyramidlike rewards system\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price fell by over 60%, and around $2 trillion disappeared from the market overall, as wealthy investors pulled out while the little guy was left in the red. Then came high-profile scandals, including the downfall of the exchange FTX and its billionaire-turned-fraudster CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. In a domino-like effect, crypto hedge funds shuttered, and President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 which had been hesitant to get involved \u2014 began a sweeping attempt to regulate the industry.\n\nCrypto\u2019s fall has particularly affected Black and brown Americans who, feeling shut out of traditional financial markets, were more likely to invest \u2014 and ultimately lose.\n\nZohar read the headlines. So he comes to DeFi mainly for the pizza, drinks, and passionate talk about what was perhaps prematurely crowned the future of finance.\n\nAmong the 15 or so other attendees, this conservative outlook was rare. While some agreed that Bitcoin has had its day \u2014 for now \u2014 there was the sense that something bigger and better was on the horizon.\n\n\u201cPolyDoge, that\u2019s the one that popped off for me,\u201d said a member who asked to go by Tom \u201cT-Bytes\u201d so employers don\u2019t know about his investments.\n\nHe\u2019s talking about an altcoin \u2014 there are thousands of cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin \u2014 that\u2019s worth $0.000000008299. It\u2019s an offshoot of Dogecoin, the widely memed crypto that\u2019s periodically resurfaced by Twitter owner Elon Musk.\n\nT-Bytes claimed he turned a profit on the risky investment and is now looking to other coins. But not all of his investments have pumped.\n\nWearing a tie-dye purple shirt, T-Bytes is not the only member to admit facing losses after last year\u2019s downturn (they\u2019re reluctant to call it a crash).\n\nKaseem Dodson became crypto curious early last year, just before prices went south. Dodson, 33, sees Bitcoin\u2019s hibernation as just another bear market. Rumor of a coming rebound keeps him vested in the industry.\n\nDodson also likes that crypto has, so far, been resistant to government regulation. But that feature has led a myriad of hucksters to take advantage of rosy-eyed investors with little knowledge of how crypto functions.\n\nThis month alone, the U.S. Justice Department recovered over $112 million in \u201cpig butchering\u201d schemes, where scammers contact victims through messaging apps with enticing offers on high-return investments. Once the Bitcoin is transferred, you can guess what happens next.\n\nAnd in Philadelphia, it remains to be seen whether victims of VBit Technologies will ever see the $11 million-plus frozen in their virtual accounts after the Washington Avenue-based company folded last summer. After VBit\u2019s lawyers dropped the embroiled company this month citing silence from its elusive CEO, the outcomes of the mounting federal lawsuits against it are hazy.\n\nThose are the scams. Other initiatives, while aboveboard, have yet to fully transform Philly into a crypto-forward hot spot like Miami or San Francisco.\n\nSoon after announcing a plan to incorporate crypto into city funding, City Hall nixed the idea. Meanwhile, scores of collectible NFTs from regional names like Wawa and the 76ers either remain unsold or are being hawked for ridiculous sums. And while a West Philadelphia house that advertised a built-in crypto miner initially made a splash, a publicly available ledger shows that today it reaps just around $14 per month.\n\nNone of this fazes 30-year-old Michael Ghen, a computer engineer and DeFi\u2019s leader, though he\u2019s frustrated at the public\u2019s perception of crypto as a back-alley market. Sympathetic to stories of losses to fraudsters, he created a guide for newcomers that outlines the mechanisms behind popular scams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s buyer beware,\u201d Ghen said.\n\nMinimizing the public\u2019s risk is a Herculean task, exemplified by the nearly 100 Bitcoin ATMs scattered throughout Philadelphia \u2014 ones that law enforcement warn are highly efficient vehicles for fraud, often in low-income communities.\n\nGhen said foreign hackers give crypto a bad name. Still, the industry is grappling with the recklessness of its former darlings like Bankman-Fried, who was arrested and faces multiple charges for mismanaging customer funds after his Bahamas-based trading company imploded in November.\n\nOne group had an idea, printing the disgraced 31-year-old\u2019s face across toilet paper at a recent crypto conference.\n\nHow larger financial institutions \u2014 including Pennsylvania billionaire Jeff Yass and his Bala Cynwyd-based Susquehanna International Group \u2014 are handling their crypto hedges is unclear, though the trend of big players pulling out of the market is on the rise.\n\nLike the statue of Don Quixote that towers over Girard Avenue, maybe you\u2019ve just got to believe. It\u2019s a block away from where Ghen and DeFi Philly are keeping the faith.\n\nIt\u2019s also near where the tech entrepreneur Thomas Jay Rush led a talk called \u201cWhat the Mennonites Can Teach us About Blockchains,\u201d a reference to the systems that record crypto transactions.\n\nWhether the neo-Luddite cousins of the Amish are invested in Bitcoin was never mentioned. Instead, Rush lauded their ability to stay tight-knit and quickly raise a barn, a metaphor for how decentralized finance can weather the future.\n\n\u201cAll communities come together,\u201d Rush said with all the optimism of a Crypto.com Super Bowl advertisement circa 2022. \u201cThey do things individuals cannot possibly do.\u201d"

However, Crypto Twitter was not ready to let it slide and unanimously decided to clarify the disinformation.\n\nWhile Senator Warren has prominently spoken against the crypto ecosystem, the latest dig at Bitcoin mining comes based on a New York Times article. The report accuses Bitcoin miners of cashing in on electricity and indirectly forcing the public to pay the price. The narrative fit Warren\u2019s perception of the crypto industry as she stated:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been ringing the alarm about the risks that Bitcoin poses to our power grids and climate. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy should use their authority to require cryptominers to disclose their energy use and emissions.\u201d\n\nTo help Warren rethink and make an informed decision, numerous entrepreneurs responded, trying to fix the misconception. Bitcoin podcaster Stephan Livera straight up dismissed the NYT report, stating that the \u201cNYT report is filled with disinformation.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, MicroStrategy founder and chairman Michael Saylor contradicted Warren\u2019s statement. He explained how Bitcoin mining does not contribute to pollution but helps decrease energy bills.\n\n#Bitcoin miners decrease the energy bill for millions of American families and do not create pollution. They are data centers running on excess electricity that would otherwise be wasted, and perform the vital role of powering the most secure computer network in the world. \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) April 18, 2023\n\nOthers from the Crypto Twitter community sought to tag Tesla CEO and Dogecoin (DOGE) supporter Elon Musk in the conversation, who has been actively trying to eradicate disinformation campaigns on his newly-owned social media platform.\n\nCanadian Broadcasting Corp said they\u2019re \u201cless than 70% government-funded\u201d, so we corrected the label pic.twitter.com/lU1EWf76Zu \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 18, 2023\n\nThe New York Times was one of the first news publications to become a victim of Musk\u2019s attack against disinformation and propaganda.

Cointelegraph reported on a method to find out who paid for Twitter Blue verification.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk reportedly buys thousands of GPUs for Twitter AI project\n\nIn a recent FOX interview, Musk revealed the development of a ChatGPT rival known as TruthGPT.

In his words:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to start something which I call TruthGPT, or a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Musk told Fox anchor Tucker Carlson that ChatGPT \u201cis programmed by left-wing experts, which train the chatbots to lie.\u201d\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

What are Bitcoin and Ether doing? I mean by the very fact that they\u2019re being considered flight to safety like gold, that\u2019s really interesting and suggests much broader-based adoption and acceptance than I think most people understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would say that there is a flight to safety, certainly led by crypto assets, and it is telling us that the world is transforming and will continue to transform. You cannot stop innovation,\u201d she added.\n\nWhy have bitcoin and other crypto assets appreciated during this banking crisis? In our view and in contrast to those in the traditional financial world, many crypto assets face no central points of failure: they are decentralized, transparent, and auditable. \u2014 Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) March 23, 2023\n\nWood thinks cryptocurrency will eventually become an \u201celection issue\u201d when the sector becomes more broadly accepted, and the public can more clearly see the kinds of regulatory pressure that the United States government is applying on the industry to maintain centralized control of money and monetary policy.\n\nNot all share Wood\u2019s sentiment.\n\nRay Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates \u2014 the world\u2019s largest hedge fund by assets under management \u2014 said in an April 12 interview that Bitcoin could not serve as an \u201ceffective currency\u201d because it is too volatile and central banks won\u2019t adopt it:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is neither an effective store hold of wealth or a medium of exchange so it is not an effective currency. It has a volatility to it that has no relation to practically anything [...] it\u2019s a very, very poor alternative to gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can outlaw [Bitcoin]. They can regulate it. Central banks and countries pretty much don\u2019t want it anyway,\u201d he said, adding that it gets attention \u201cway out of proportion\u201d to its size.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin likely to outperform all crypto assets following banking crisis, analyst explains\n\nDalio strengthened his case by pointing out that gold is the third largest reserve held by central banks, trailing only the U.S. dollar and euros.\n\nDespite previously describing Bitcoin as \u201cone hell of an invention,\u201d Dalio recently said that he instead wants to see an \u201cinflation-linked\u201d coin be built that would serve to ensure consumers secure their buying power.\n\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom"

For example, he said it knowingly allowed U.S. citizens to trade on the exchange through the use of obfuscation tools. The comments stem from the CFTC\u2019s March 27 lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, for alleged trading violations.\n\nAlso on April 14, in an open meeting with U.S. Securities and Exchange commissioners and staff, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the agency will be revisiting the proposed redefinition of an \u201cexchange.\u201d The SEC intends to bring certain brokers under additional regulatory scrutiny, and explicitly include decentralized applications.\n\nOn April 17, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged crypto asset trading platform Bittrex and former CEO William Shihara with allegedly operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. Separately, Bittrex Global is being charged witoperating a shared order book with Bittrex.\n\nBittrex had already announced its intention of closing down U.S. operations on April 30 after reportedly receiving a Wells notice in March warning about the impending regulatory action.\n\nOther countries are taking different approaches\n\nThe regulatory environment in Hong Kong seems to have improved after China\u2019s state-affiliated banks began to onboard crypto companies. In addition to the Bank of Communications, ZA Bank \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s largest virtual bank controlled by a Chinese internet insurer \u2014 will also act as the settlement bank for some crypto companies.\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, these banks will serve as settlement banks to enable token deposits at authorized exchanges to be withdrawn in Hong Kong dollars, Chinese yuan and U.S. dollars.\n\nThe securities regulator of Argentina also approved a Bitcoin-based futures index on April 12. The regulated derivatives contract will offer qualified investors a safe and regulated way to gain BTC exposure. All trades will be settled in the national fiat currency, with traders required to deposit Argentine pesos through bank transfer.\n\nTo understand how professional traders are positioned, traders should analyze the options markets.\n\nOptions traders are leaning toward bearish structures\n\nTraders can gauge the market's sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.\n\nA put-to-call ratio of 0.70 indicates that put option open interest lags behind the greater number of call options. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which is a bearish sign.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nSince April 5, Bitcoin's put-to-call ratio has been either balanced or favoring protective put options. The current 0.60 indicator slightly shows higher demand for neutral-to-bearish option strategies, although there is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nTo confirm whether traders effectively became bearish, one should also analyze the Bitcoin futures markets.\n\nBitcoin futures metrics remain neutral-to-bearish\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. These fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement for a longer period of time.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts on healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin 'mega whales' send BTC price to $30K as volatility hits crypto\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nThe chart shows traders have been neutral-to-bearish for the past two weeks as the basis indicator oscillated between 2.4% and 4.3%. This data should not come as a surprise given that Bitcoin price remains 56% below its $69,000 all-time high.\n\nBitcoin's margin and futures markets reflect a neutral to bearish sentiment, but nothing exaggerated. The reduction in demand from bullish strategies is likely reflecting the 50% Bitcoin price gains since March 11.\n\nHowever, investors fear regulatory action could dim the demand for retail and institutional clients, so unless there's more clarity on that front, the odds of Bitcoin breaking above $31,000 remain slim.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Intel Discontinues Bitcoin-Mining Blockscale Chips, No Future Gens Announced - Tom's Hardware",
        "content": "(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIt's been just a year since Intel officially announced its Bitcoin-mining Blockscale ASICs, but today the company announced the end of life of its first-gen Blockscale 1000-series chips without announcing any follow-up generations of the chips. We spoke with Intel on the matter, and the company told Tom's Hardware that \u201cAs we prioritize our investments in IDM 2.0, we have end-of-lifed the Intel Blockscale 1000 Series ASIC while we continue to support our Blockscale customers.\u201d\n\n\n\nIntel's statement cites the company's tighter focus on its IDM 2.0 operations as the reason for ending the Blockscale ASICs, a frequent refrain in many of its statements as it has exited several businesses amid company-wide belt-tightening. We also asked Intel if it planned to exit the Bitcoin ASIC business entirely, but the company responded, \"We continue to monitor market opportunities.\"\n\nIn the original announcement that the company would enter the blockchain market, then-graphics-chief Raja Koduri noted that the company had created a Custom Compute Group within the AXG graphics unit to support the Bitcoin ASICs and \"additional emerging technology.\" However, Intel recently restructured the AXG group, and Koduri left the company shortly thereafter. We asked Intel about the fate of the Custom Compute Group, but it says it has no organizational changes to share at this time.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIntel hasn't announced any next-gen Bitcoin mining products and its Blockscale ASIC landing pages are now all inactive, but its statement implies that it is leaving the door open for future opportunities if they arise. Intel's initial entry into the market for bitcoin-mining chips came at an inopportune time, as its chips finally became available right as Bitcoin valuations crashed at the end of the last crypto craze, and Intel's apparent exit from the market comes as Bitcoin is back on the upswing \u2014 it recently cleared $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year.\n\n\n\nIntel's Bitcoin-mining chips initially came into the public eye under the Bonanza Mine codename it used for its R&D chips that were never commercialized, but the company later announced it would enter the blockchain market and summarily launched a second-gen model named 'Blockscale\" to select large-scale mining companies like BLOCK, GRIID Infrastructure, and Argo Blockchain, among others.\n\n\n\nAside from exceptionally competitive performance relative to competing Bitcoin-mining chips, Blockscale's big value prop stemmed from the stability of Intel's chip-fabbing resources. Several large industrial mining companies signed large long-term deals for a steady supply of Blockscale ASICs, thus circumventing the volatility with the mostly China-based manufacturers that engaged in wild pricing manipulations based on Bitcoin valuations, were subject to tariffs, and suffered from supply disruptions and shortages, not to mention the increased costs of logistics and shipping from China.\n\n(Image credit: Intel)\n\nIntel tells us that it will continue to serve its existing Boockscale customers, implying it will satisfy its existing long-term contracts. Intel's customers have until October 2023 to order new chips, and shipments will end in April 2024. Meanwhile, Intel has scrubbed nearly all of the landing and product pages for the Blockscale chips from its website.\n\n\n\nIntel's latest move comes on the heels of a cost-cutting spree \u2014 the company sold off its server-building business last week, killed off its networking switch business, ended its 5G modems, wound down its Optane Memory production, jettisoned the company's drone business and sold its SSD storage unit to SK Hynix.\n\n\n\nIntel's cost-cutting also applies to numerous other projects, as Intel has also shelved plans for a mega-lab in Oregon and canceled its planned development center in Haifa. The company has also trimmed some programs, like its RISC-V pathfinder program, and streamlined its data center graphics roadmap by axing the Rialto Bridge GPUs and delaying its Falcon Shores chips to 2025.\n\nIt's unclear it Intel will continue to make further cuts to its far-flung businesses, but it is clear that the company is committed to slimming down to increase its focus on its core competencies as it weathers some of the worst market conditions in decades, not to mention intense competition from multiple foes."

In contrast, short-term holders (STH), who acquired coins after FTX failed, have seen their supply balance of 2.914 million BTC remain relatively constant in 2023.\n\nLong-term holders are unfazed despite major downturns\n\nBy April 12, 155 days had passed since the FTX exchange collapsed on Nov. 8, 2022. The 155-day mark is crucial because it is the minimum length of time that a Bitcoin holder must have held their coins to be classified as a long-term holder (LTH).\n\nThus, the supply distribution can be divided into two halves, first, before FTX\u2019s collapse to represent LTH supply, and the other after, to represent short-term holders.\n\nBitcoin Long/Short-Term Holder Supply. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe report also drew a comparison of previous market cycles based on LTH behavior expressed via changes in their supply. It noted that Bitcoin is currently experiencing a period of \u201cPlateau of Patience,\u201d where LTH supply tends to hover around its ATH, often from several months to over a year.\n\nIt added that the supply structure also has similarities to early 2016 and early 2019. Notably, while Bitcoin\u2019s price did not form new lows in 2016 and 2019, the actual bull run didn\u2019t start for 18 to24 months in late 2020 and 2021. The period of parabolic rise usually witnesses a swift spike in the percentage of holdings on LTH in profit, followed by profit-taking.\n\nLong-term and short-term holder supply in profit/loss.

        "content": "Many investors have dismissed the notion that bitcoin could be a type of digital gold since the cryptocurrency has been trading like a speculative risk asset for much of the past two years. But about 50 years ago, gold did the same thing, Morgan Stanley said in a recent note. If bitcoin's current moves continue to follow those of gold in the 1970s, the cryptocurrency could be in for some tough times ahead. In 1971, individuals could no longer convert U.S. dollars to a specified amount of gold. Since 2008, governments have become more reliant on central banks creating new fiat currency \u2014 money that isn't backed by a commodity \u2014 to provide support in times of crisis, according to Morgan Stanley's note. That's different from bitcoin, which has a limited supply. In the '70s, \"gold was tracking the rising rate of consumer price inflation (CPI), which was largely a result of the recent explosion of fiat money supply,\" said Sheena Shah, a strategist at Morgan Stanley and a coauthor of the note. \"Bitcoin, on a logarithmic scale, has so far followed a similar path to the price speculation of gold in the 1970s, which also seemed to follow a four year cycle.\" Starting in 1971, gold prices quadrupled within four years as the U.S. dollar money supply grew rapidly, the strategist said. \"That wasn't the height of the speculation, however: from August 1976 to January 1980, the price of gold rose eightfold from $102 to $850.\" \"As the gold price was still managed for the first few years, the similarities may be a statistical coincidence \u2026 more likely, in our view, is that both were driven by similar speculation cycles,\" she added. Bitcoin fans have long highlighted its potential to act as a \"digital gold\" because it's divisible, scarce and doesn't rely on a central issuer. They also once argued that bitcoin offered a hedge against equities, but last year's market havoc threw cold water on that idea as the cryptocurrency's correlation with stocks hit an all-time high . At the end of March, that correlation fell to its lowest since 2021 , while bitcoin's correlation with gold has been climbing. After the Federal Reserve loosened monetary policy to support the economy at the start of the Covid pandemic, bitcoin outperformed gold 2.9x over the three-and-a-half-year period, Bernstein recently noted. This year, banking crisis fears in the U.S. helped push bitcoin to even greater gains. \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom and Gabriel Cortes contributed reporting"

The company positioned the Blockscale 1000-series ASICs to lower power usage and help ease the then-ongoing shortage of GPUs.\n\n\u201cFor proof-of-work algorithms that are compatible with ASIC-based systems and SHA-256 hashing, the Intel Blockscale ASIC will provide the energy efficiency and computing power needed to achieve scalability and sustainability,\" reads an unsigned Intel blog post. \"And given the nature of the silicon powering this technology, Intel will be able to supply it in volume without compromising the supply of new CPUs or GPUs.\u201d\n\nToday, Intel quietly discontinued the Blockscale 1000 chips, and the company told Tom\u2019s Hardware that it has no immediate plans to introduce any upgrades or replacements. The company will \"continue to support\" companies that have already purchased Blockscale chips, but it looks like the project is fading away barely a year after its original announcement.\n\nRegarding blockchain hashing operations like bitcoin mining, ASICs are better than GPUs, just as GPUs are better than CPUs. The hardware is more specialized, making it less flexible\u2014I can mine or play a game with my GPU, while an ASIC is really only good for one thing. But in exchange, it can deliver faster hash rates with lower power usage than a GPU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blockscale project came from Intel's \"Custom Compute Group,\" a specialized team inside Intel's Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group (AXG), announced by AXG manager Raja Koduri in February 2022. But by December, AXG had been split up and folded into Intel's existing client computing and data center teams, and Koduri left the company at the end of March.\n\nIntel introduced the Blockscale chips just as bitcoin's value was cratering; the value of the currency slid from nearly $46,000 in April 2022 to less than $17,000 in December, and the less the currency is worth, the harder it is to justify the hardware investment and the power use necessary to run a mining operation. The currency has ticked back up to just over $30,000 in 2023, though that's still down substantially from its $64,000 peak in late 2021.\n\nIntel told Tom's Hardware that it was discontinuing Blockscale chips partly to focus on its nascent foundry business and \"IDF 2.0\" strategy, an attempt to make more money by letting third parties use Intel's fabs. Intel and Arm announced earlier this month that companies would be able to design and manufacture Arm chips using Intel's upcoming 18A process."

        "content": "The bear market grind has not deterred a $60 million raise from a Bitcoin-only company.\n\nUnchained, a financial services provider for Bitcoin (BTC) holders, has announced a $60 million Series B funding round led by Valor Equity Partners. NYDIG, Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital and Highland Capital Partners also participated.\n\nUnchained Capital provides a more secure way to hold fees than storing crypto on centralized exchanges or on a single key solution. The custody model leverages the Bitcoin network's native multi-signature capabilities in that clients share control of their Bitcoin between private keys they hold themselves and private keys held by Unchained or other financial services companies.\n\nMultisignature solutions eliminate single points of failure and mitigate counterparty risk by sharing it between multiple parties. Simply put, compare the multi-sig process to a safe deposit box with two keys, one held by the customer and the other by the bank.\n\nSingle points of failure were a recurring theme during the 2022 crypto collapses: From BlockFi to Celsius to Three Arrows Capital, an array of centralized solutions collapsed, taking users\u2019 funds along the way. Multisig radically reduces risk as no one party can run off with the funds.\n\nThe CEO of Unchained Capital, Joe Kelly, explained:\n\n\u201cMultisig is one of the most important technologies in the ecosystem that can be taken mainstream. It helps to protect individuals from loss and theft, two of the biggest issues for the industry.\u201d\n\nTo date, Unchained secures over $2 billion in Bitcoin across thousands of keys globally. Casa, a competitor crypto security company, recently announced it would add Ethereum (ETH) to its suite of products.\n\nRelated: 6M Bitcoin Are Secured by Shared Custody\n\nAccording to the announcement, the $60 million in funding will be used to expand the client base and product offering further. Kelly told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cUsing this fresh capital investment to expand our reach and suite of services, we hope to enable new entrants to Bitcoin to leapfrog centralized custodians into our safer collaborative custody model.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the group will hope to further the mantra \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d In light of centralized exchange collapses, greater numbers of Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts learn to take custody of their assets, and multisig will undoubtedly play a greater role."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price 2023: New All-Time High Coming Soon? - YouHodler.com",
        "content": "Last year was difficult for the crypto market, but Bitcoin has bounced back from the price lows it experienced. Investors are even preparing for a new Bitcoin all-time high. The cryptocurrency is enjoying a strong rally in 2023. Bitcoin prices rose from $16,600 in December 2022 to over $28,000 in March 2023.\n\nFinancial crises like the FTX exchange and Signature Bank collapses, have wounded some cryptocurrencies and stocks. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is only growing stronger. Some say Bitcoin may even surpass the $66,790 price tag it earned in 2021 soon. We\u2019ll explore why experts are so bullish on Bitcoin, and how you can prepare for a new all-time high.\n\nBitcoin's all-time high: is it coming in 2023?\n\nSeveral experts predict that 2023 is the year Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high price. Bitcoin experienced a lot of volatility in the past two years - in November of 2021, its price tag was over USD 66,000. In 2022, the cryptocurrency suffered a -34.72% overall price drop, reaching its lowest price yet.\n\nCryptocurrency suffered due to geopolitical and economic instability in 2022. It also faces opposition from governments across the world.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is outspoken in its criticism of crypto, citing its lack of regulation and potentially fraudulent uses.\n\nChina has gone so far as to ban crypto.\n\nOther countries like South Korea are developing stricter policies around foreign crypto exchanges.\n\nDespite this, insiders and crypto experts have positive sentiments about the future of Bitcoin.\n\nThe resilient digital currency has numerous benefits that give users more value than other assets. Its decentralized and anonymous nature allows for\n\nSecure,\n\nfast, and\n\ntransparent transactions.\n\nChief strategy officer Marshall Beard at popular crypto exchange Gemini thinks Bitcoin will soar. When talking about Bitcoin market trends, Beard said, \u2018\u2019I think Bitcoin probably breaks all-time highs this year\u2019\u2019. The CTO of crypto stablecoin Tether, Paolo Ardoino, agrees with this sentiment. In an interview with CNBC in March, he said\n\n\u200d\u2018\u2019I\u2019m bullish on Bitcoin, I think that it can easily retest the all-time high levels - around 60k\u2019\u2019.\n\nEven experts who are less sure of the crypto breaking through a new all-time high price are certain it will perform well. Rand Neuner, the founder of CNBC\u2019s Crypto Banter and CEO of Onchain Capital, is one of them. \u2018\u2019Between now and the end of the year, I see Bitcoin going above $50,000\u2019\u2019.\n\nBitcoin forecast: why are people giving a bullish Bitcoin prediction?\n\nMany worried that the recent banking crisis would severely impact Bitcoin. Instead, Bitcoin has surpassed all expectations and rallied, rising 70% in recent weeks. This is the first time the cryptocurrency topped $28,000 in the past nine months. The 2023 banking crisis is ongoing, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March - making it the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.\n\nSuggested reading: YouHodler\u2019s Thoughts on the Banking Crisis\n\nCitizens\u2019 confidence in U.S. banks plummeted, and capital flowed into Bitcoin instead. Cryptocurrency operates as a more secure alternative to protecting money. Governments or malicious parties are also unable to tamper with it.\n\nCrypto insiders pointed out this is Bitcoin\u2019s purpose as a decentralised digital currency, and new investors are discovering its appeal. This is great news for the future of Bitcoin\u2019s reputation - proving that users can count on it even during a crisis.\n\nWhat the experts say\n\nCrypto enthusiasts and experts alike are giving Bitcoin a bullish prediction due to several signs. Other than its exceptional performance this year, the crypto is showing signs of rising further. The gaining price has paused slightly since March\u2019s huge uptrend. Still, a hidden MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) price divergence suggests a long-term bullish market.\n\nThe MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator, which reveals the momentum and strength of crypto.\n\nA bullish MACD divergence occurs when the indicator\u2019s two rising lows match the price\u2019s two falling lows.\n\nA green MACD correctly predicted Bitcoin\u2019s upsurges five times in the past. It suggests that the overall crypto market cap may increase, positively impacting Bitcoin.\n\n\u200d\n\nAnother bullish sign is Bitcoin\u2019s dominance levels, which are now at 47%. This is the highest Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been since June 2022, and it\u2019s still rising. Even as other coins fall, such as Litecoin and Cardano, Bitcoin gets stronger.\n\n\u200d\n\nExperts think that Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event in 2024 is also contributing to its bullish trend. The last halving occurred in 2020, with three halvings total since Bitcoin\u2019s inception. There has always been a parabolic uptrend in price post-halving.\n\nWhen will Bitcoin rise again?\n\nInsiders agree that 2023 is the year for Bitcoin, and the year\u2019s first few months have proved so. Bitcoin is already on the rise from its lows last year in every way. Bitcoin\u2019s price, market sentiments, and market cap are more desirable now and still rising. Time will only tell how far Bitcoin\u2019s bullish price increase will go. Long-term investors are convinced it will perform stronger than last year, and market sentiments are growing more positive.\n\nBitcoin prediction: Final thoughts\n\nBitcoin\u2019s potential as a store of value and as a tradable digital asset is undeniable. The crypto rally after this year\u2019s banking crisis is a great signal of things to come. However, Bitcoin\u2019s low liquidity raises concerns for some. It makes the crypto more prone to volatility. If large amounts of Bitcoin are traded at once, its value is affected.\n\nDue to this, traders should take risk management measures to invest in crypto safely. Keep a diversified portfolio to hedge your investments against inflation and reduce volatility. Traders can also use stop-loss and take-profit orders to keep their assets safe remotely.\n\nDisclaimer: \u201cThe content should not be construed as investment advice and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

        "title": "Unchained Announces $60 Million Series B Funding to Expand Bitcoin Financial Services - Business Wire",
        "content": "AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Unchained, the leader in financial services for bitcoin holders, has announced its $60 million Series B funding round led by Valor Equity Partners. The initial close, completed on April 11, included participation from existing investors NYDIG, Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital, and Highland Capital Partners. The Series B builds further momentum following a $15 million financing led by Ten31 that was completed last fall.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of market chaos, Unchained has emerged as a highly trusted provider of bitcoin custody and financial services through superior technology, risk management, regulatory compliance, and client service,\u201d said Vivek Pattipati, a Partner at Valor who will be joining Unchained\u2019s Board of Directors. \u201cParticularly in lending, the company has differentiated itself by minimizing risk to both the lender and the borrower, leading to resilience and an extraordinary opportunity to capture market share.\"\n\nUnchained\u2019s collaborative custody model uses bitcoin\u2019s native multisignature capabilities to provide the benefits of self-custody while mitigating its risks. Clients share control of their bitcoin between private keys they hold themselves and private keys held by Unchained and other financial services companies. This not only eliminates single points of failure, through loss or theft of keys, but also mitigates counterparty risk by sharing it between multiple people and companies. The underlying causes of recent collapses at FTX or BlockFi cannot happen to Unchained\u2019s clients because the company is not able to singularly move or rehypothecate client funds and clients can verify this for themselves at any time.\n\nUnchained\u2019s collaborative custody platform secures over $2 billion in bitcoin across thousands of keys around the globe. The company has originated over $500 million in bitcoin-collateralized loans since 2017, while experiencing zero loan losses. The Unchained trading desk allows clients to buy bitcoin directly to cold storage, and its IRA offering allows clients to hold keys to their bitcoin within tax-advantaged retirement accounts \u2013 an industry first.\n\nUnchained plans to use the new funding to grow its client base and improve upon its core suite of financial services delivered through collaborative custody, as well as expand its product offerings. Unchained believes that while bitcoin continues to grow in adoption, there is a tremendous opportunity for products that bridge into the traditional dollar ecosystem around credit, trading, investment, and other financial services.\n\nToday\u2019s macroeconomic climate is such that new bitcoiners are being created every day \u2013 they just don\u2019t know it yet. Unchained is already well-known for bitcoin education and thought leadership. \u201cUsing this fresh capital investment to expand our reach and suite of services,\u201d said Unchained CEO Joe Kelly, \u201cwe hope to enable new entrants to bitcoin to leapfrog centralized custodians into our safer collaborative custody model.\u201d\n\nAbout Unchained\n\nFounded in 2016, Unchained is a top 10 bitcoin platform in the US by assets and has helped thousands of individuals and businesses truly own their wealth by holding bitcoin keys. Unchained's collaborative custody model allows clients to access financial services while continuing to have the benefits of self-custody, the ultimate consumer protection in these uncertain times.

        "content": "DailyMail.com can reveal the government was ordered to liquidate the stolen gains and has been offloading it through Coinbase\n\nZhong converted $700,000 to cash and hoped 'the visual appeal of the cash would impress a female into having sexual relations with him,' prosecutors said\n\nJames Zhong, 32, of Gainesville, Georgia, was sentenced to a year and a day in prison on Friday on wire fraud charges for stealing $3.36billion in Bitcoin\n\nThe geeky Georgia crypto scammer who was found hiding $3billion in Bitcoin in a popcorn tin, admitted to trying to use the appeal of cash and a lavish lifestyle to help him score women as he was sentenced to one year behind bars.\n\nJames Zhong, 32, of Gainsville, pleaded guilty to wire fraud last year for illegally obtaining over 50,000 Bitcoin from the now-defunct Silk Road marketplace over a decade ago. He was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison on Friday by a judge in New York.\n\nThe raid on Zhong's home in November 2021 resulted in the largest cryptocurrency seizure ever and the second-largest financial seizure by authorities.\n\nAnd DailyMail.com can reveal the US government is now in the process of offloading the stolen gains after a judge told the US Marshals Service to liquidate the crypto currency.\n\nJames Zhong, 32, of Gainesville, Georgia, was sentenced to a year and one day in prison last week after pleading guilty to wire fraud for the theft of $3.36billion in Bitcoin, admitting he thought the appeal of cash would help him score women\n\nIn a 2021 raid, law enforcement recovered over 50,000 Bitcoin, worth $3.36billion, including Casascius coins - or physical bitcoin - from Zhong's home\n\nThey also seized $662,600 in cash and 11 one-ounce bars of silver and gold\n\nZhong had asked for no jail time, and the Justice Department agreed on the lenient sentence for the 32-year-old due in part to his autism diagnosis, his young age, and his help recovering the billions in Bitcoin.\n\nZhong wanted the money for sex, according to charging documents prepared by assistant US attorney David Felton.\n\nHe converted $700,000 to cash so he could have a 'case full of money like in the movies', a psychological assessment filed with the federal court said.\n\n'He hoped the visual appeal of the cash would impress a female into having sexual relations with him,' Felton wrote.\n\n'He stated his plan did not work.'\n\nProsecutors said Zhong spent 'lavishly on real estate investments, luxury products, travel, hotels, nightclubs, and other expenses.'\n\nPhotos from Zhong's social media show him posing with bikini-clad girls on a yacht in a city marina and dressed in a suit with two other women in front of a stretch limousine.\n\nProperty records show he owned at least seven power boats, including a 23ft 2009 Yamaha.\n\nIn a statement filed with the court, Zhong said he 'always hated school' and was a victim of bullying, including kids pulling down his pants at a football game.\n\nHe said he found solace at home on his computer.\n\nZhong had obtained millions in cryptocurrencies while studying at the University of Georgia from 2008 to 2014. During that time he drank excessively and used cocaine.\n\nWhen cops raided his lakeside home in Gainesville, Georgia, in November 2021 they found a hard drive containing thousands of Bitcoin stashed in a Cheetos popcorn tin, wrapped in a towel.\n\nProsecutors said Zhong spent 'lavishly on real estate investments, luxury products, travel, hotels, nightclubs, and other expenses', and photos from his social media show him dressed in a suit with two other women in front of a stretch limousine\n\nWhen cops raided his lakeside home in Gainesville they found a hard drive containing thousands of Bitcoin stashed in a Cheetos popcorn tin, wrapped in a towel\n\nThe digital tokens were hidden in a 'single board computer' found inside the tin and stored in a bathroom close of Zhong's home\n\nThey also seized $662,000 in cash and 11 one-ounce bars of silver and gold.\n\nHe had stolen Bitcoin in 2012 from the infamous dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nDailyMail.com can reveal the government is trading the seized Bitcoin \u2013 billions of dollars of it \u2013 through a crypto exchange that it is investigating for a crime.\n\nAccording to a court filing by New York prosecutors, the first US Marshals sale of the Bitcoin was on March 14.\n\nThe government sold it on cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase \u2013 just like millions of other crypto traders, who have been characterized as 'degenerates' and basement-dwelling geeks in the past three years since digital currencies took off in popularity.\n\nThe only difference was size. The government's transaction was for 9,861 Bitcoin, sold for a total $215,738,155.\n\n'There remains approximately 41,490.72 BTC, which the Government understands is expected to be liquidated in four more batches over the course of this calendar year,' Felton wrote in a sentencing memo for Zhong filed on March 31.\n\nBut Wall Street veterans and crypto entrepreneurs may be unimpressed at the feds' trading abilities.\n\nTheir March sell-off achieved an average price of $21,878 per Bitcoin, though the official Bitcoin price on the 14th ranged from $24,052 to $26,553.90, according to figures from Coinbase \u2013 meaning the government missed out on up to $46million by selling below the market price that day.\n\nProsecutors' court filings said the government also spent $215,738.15 in transaction fees (a rate of 0.1%) to make the sale, which will have been paid to Coinbase.\n\nThe fee represents a special deal for the Marshals Service, as Coinbase's headline rate is 0.5% for its normal customers' Bitcoin trades.\n\nZhong, who has autism and was bullied as a child, said he wanted the money for sex, according to charging documents prepared by assistant US attorney David Felton\n\nZhong's house in Gainesville, Georgia, where agents conducted the raid in November 2021\n\nThe sale could also prove to be controversial, as the Marshals Service revealed it is using Coinbase to sell its Bitcoin, even while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing to sue the crypto exchange company for allegedly violating investor protection laws.\n\nLast month Coinbase said it received a 'Wells notice', warning of impending litigation by the SEC.\n\n'It's ironic that the US government recently used Coinbase to liquidate some of its bitcoin stack from Silk Road, at the same time as a different arm of the US government (the SEC) is pursuing an enforcement action against Coinbase,' Crypto and banking expert Caitlin Long told DailyMail.com.\n\nCoinbase has been involved in a slew of other law enforcement actions in the past two years.\n\nJust last year the Commission charged a manager at the company with a $1.1million insider trading scheme.\n\nIn March 2021 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ordered Coinbase to pay a $6.5million fine for 'reckless false, misleading, or inaccurate reporting'.\n\nAnd in January 2023 Coinbase agreed to pay a $50million fine to New York regulators for letting customers open accounts with few background checks.\n\n'The US government doesn't really care, they just want to get their money,' Steven Lubka, managing director of the Bitcoin-only crypto company Swan Bitcoin, told DailyMail.com.\n\n'But it is a tacit endorsement. They are at least endorsing Coinbase instead of the competition, even if they're not explicitly saying they agree with this stuff.'\n\nThe NASDAQ-listed crypto exchange has thrown millions at lobbying the SEC, the Treasury Department which ultimately decided on the use of Coinbase to flog its seized coins, and other government departments.\n\nSenate records show Coinbase spent $7.3million on lobbying since 2015 directly and via eight lobby firms, including $6,565,000 since 2021.\n\nAccording to the sentencing memo, the fraudster had sat on up to $3.36billion of Bitcoin for 10 years \u2013 but had spent less than 5% of it\n\nLubka said he didn't think Coinbase's lobbying had been very effective.\n\n'What they really want is regulation that's good for crypto, and it's hard to look at anything and feel like they've gotten that,' he said.\n\nIn his sentencing, US District Judge Paul Gardephe noted the 'highly sophisticated nature of the crime' but granted a shorter sentence compared to a 27-33 month guideline due to the 'truly unique circumstances' of the case.\n\nThe DoJ's sentencing memo said Zhong had sat on up to $3.36billion of Bitcoin for 10 years \u2013 but had spent less than 5% of it, a relatively tiny slice totaling $16million.\n\n'I always knew what I did was wrong,' the fraudster told the judge. 'I think I buried my head in the sand\u2026 It made me feel important and worth something.'\n\nHe set up a real estate investing company with a business partner which owned two commercial properties worth a total $5.15 million, Tennessee bankruptcy filings said.\n\nZhong forfeited his 80% stake in the company as part of his plea deal.\n\nZhong stole the majority of the Bitcoin from the Silk Road dark web marketplace when he was just 22.\n\nHe created a computer program that deposited Bitcoin in a Silk Road account then submitted several withdrawal requests so quickly it bamboozled the site's system into giving him back more coins than he put in.\n\nHe used the scheme to steal approximately 50,000 BTC.\n\nThe government's recent selling of Zhong's ill-gotten gains comes amid a crypto crackdown by regulators.\n\nIn January the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined crypto lender Nexo $45million and charged another, Genesis, with offering unregistered securities.\n\nIn February the SEC forced crypto exchange Kraken to end its popular interest-paying program, and warned Paxos it faces a potential lawsuit over its 'stablecoin' currencies pegged to the US dollar.\n\nNBA star Paul Pierce paid the commission $1.4million to settle charges he plugged a cryptocurrency without proper disclosures.\n\nThree top financial regulators, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), wrote to American banks warning of 'key risks associated with crypto-assets' \u2013 though adding that 'banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation.'\n\n'I've been referring to it as the crypto carpet bombing,' Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, a crypto industry trade group, told the New York Times in February. 'Every couple hours we hear of some new enforcement action.'\n\nThe government's dump of almost 10,000 Bitcoin did appear to have an impact on the cryptocurrency price on March 14.\n\nBitcoin began the early hours that day at around $24,500, rising to $26,554 by 9am East Coast time. But as soon as the working day started in Washington DC, selling began and the price crashed down over 9% to $24,052 at 5pm.\n\nAccording to statistics from Bitcoinity.org, the government activity could have constituted up to 20% of the roughly 50,000 BTC traded that day.\n\nHowever, in a statement to DailyMail.com, and in contrast to federal prosecutors' filings, the Marshals Service said the sale was actually conducted over six days.\n\n'In general, the USMS no longer auctions cryptocurrency but instead liquidates via a secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring, and storing cryptocurrency,' a spokesman said, alluding to Coinbase.\n\n'In the case in question, the USMS liquidated the bitcoin over a six-day period last month using the method previously mentioned.\n\n'The USMS will not comment on the timing of future liquidations.'\n\nPublicly available transaction data showed 9,826 Bitcoin was sent from a government-controlled crypto wallet to one of Coinbase's wallets on March 7.\n\nThe sell-off was not particularly large by the standards of the wild rollercoaster crypto markets.\n\nTrading volumes reached 182,000 in one day as recently as November 9, and on March 13, 2020 more than 481,000 Bitcoin were traded in one day according to Bitcoinity.org.\n\nThe highest volume day was on January 5, 2017, when 14.1 million Bitcoin changed hands."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction, is $50,000 possible this year? Experts are backing this token over BTC for better returns in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrencies has been unpredictable over the past few years, with prices rising and falling on a whim. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen its fair share of volatility, with prices reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in 2021, before dropping to under $30,000 just a few months later. But what does the future hold for Bitcoin? Is it possible for the cryptocurrency to reach $50,000 this year?\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nWhile no one can accurately predict the future price of Bitcoin, experts believe that $50,000 is a realistic target for the cryptocurrency in 2023. According to experts, the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $50,000 this year is realistic.\n\nThey predict that this price could be reached again in the middle of the year, specifically at the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third quarter of 2023. Even if there were another market crash, a spike to that level could still be possible during the summer.\n\nThis prediction is based on several factors, including the increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, the growing number of institutional investors entering the market, and the limited supply of Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the key drivers of Bitcoin\u2019s price is its scarcity. The cryptocurrency has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, with around 19.3 million already in circulation. This limited supply has made Bitcoin a popular store of value, with investors looking to buy and hold the cryptocurrency as a long-term investment.\n\nAnother factor that could increase Bitcoin\u2019s price is the increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. In recent years, we have seen a growing number of companies and financial institutions embracing cryptocurrencies, with some even accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. This increased adoption could lead to a surge in demand for Bitcoin, which could, in turn, drive up its price.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and its price can fluctuate dramatically in a short time. While $50,000 may be a realistic target for Bitcoin in 2023, there is no guarantee that the cryptocurrency will reach this level.\n\nBacking a Token Over Bitcoin\n\nWhile Bitcoin has traditionally been the go-to cryptocurrency for investors, there are now several other tokens that are starting to gain traction. One such token is RenQ Finance (RENQ), which has been tipped by experts as a potentially better investment option than Bitcoin in 2023.\n\nRenQ Finance is a DeFi token that has been gaining traction due to its innovative features and strong community support. The project aims to establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, connecting all isolated blockchains and providing all necessary underlying support for the DeFi ecosystem. This unique approach has led to much interest in the project, with some of the top investors and big whales of other cryptocurrencies also investing in RenQ Finance.\n\nThe success of RenQ Finance is evident in its ongoing presale, which has already raised $10.6 million in the fastest time ever recorded for a presale. This achievement has been backed by industry experts, who have recognized the potential of the project.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be the more well-known cryptocurrency, RenQ Finance has the potential to provide better returns in 2023. The project\u2019s innovative features and strong community support make it a potentially safer investment option, particularly for those looking to diversify their portfolio.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe future of Bitcoin is uncertain, with its price likely to continue fluctuating in the coming months and years. While $50,000 may be a realistic target for Bitcoin in 2023, investors should consider diversifying their portfolio and looking at other potentially profitable investment options.\n\nRenQ Finance is a DeFi token that has been gaining traction due to its innovative features and strong community support. The project\u2019s ongoing presale success and backing by industry experts make it a potentially better investment option than Bitcoin in 2023. However, as with any investment, it\u2019s important to do your research and consider the risks involved before investing in any cryptocurrency.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Did Any Coloradans Pay Their State Income Taxes in Crypto? - 5280 - 5280 | The Denver Magazine",
        "content": "This year\u2019s Tax Day isn\u2019t just the deadline for individuals to submit income tax returns and their associated payments. It also marks the closing of a unique tax season in Colorado history: the first in which the state accepted digital assets.\n\nLast September, Governor Jared Polis kicked things off when he announced that, effective immediately, Colorado would begin accepting cryptocurrencies as payments for a number of different taxes, most notably state income taxes. The move wasn\u2019t entirely surprising for Polis, who has been a noted fan of blockchain technology since before he became Colorado\u2019s governor and who has since made multiple appearances at ETHDenver, the annual crypto conference that\u2019s hosted in the Mile High City.\n\nWhat is surprising is just how few Coloradans actually did it: As of April 14, only 11 people paid their state income taxes using crypto, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue. Of the roughly 3.1 million individual tax returns Colorado can expect to receive this year, that represents just 0.00035 percent. To put that return rate into context, a person faces roughly the same odds of getting struck by lightning in a year as the state of Colorado had in receiving a tax payment in crypto.\n\nBut Daniel Carr, communications director at the Department of Revenue, says the state isn\u2019t losing sleep over the low rate of crypto participation. \u201c[It\u2019s] just another option for our taxpayers,\u201d he wrote 5280 in an emailed statement. \u201cWe like to promote a culture of voluntary compliance, and the more options you give people, the better and easier it is for them to do their civic duty. We don\u2019t really see a downside as there is no ongoing cost or risk to the Department of Revenue.\u201d\n\nColorado uses PayPal to handle all cryptocurrency payments from taxpayers, which converts users\u2019 crypto into U.S. dollars before it hits the state treasury. Hence, Carr says, no risk to the state.\n\nBut according to a couple of experts in Colorado\u2019s cryptocurrency community, PayPal is the problem\u2014and it\u2019s why hardly anyone paid their taxes in crypto this tax season.\n\n\u201cMost people I know won\u2019t use PayPal,\u201d says John Paller, founder of ETHDenver. \u201cCrypto is supposed to decentralize our commercial activities, not replicate old systems with new payment assets. The fact that there are additional steps doesn\u2019t make any sense, and we have provided this feedback to Governor Polis.\u201d\n\nThe extra steps that Paller is referring to stem from the fact that PayPal introduces fees and requires additional actions on the part of taxpayers. To start, PayPal adds a surcharge of between 1.5 and 1.8 percent on top of all crypto payments, so there\u2019s an additional expense. Crypto users must also take the step to either buy crypto on PayPal or transfer assets into PayPal from other digital wallets (and transfers have fees, too). And crypto enthusiasts say that perhaps the most significant issue with PayPal is that the platform only accepts four kinds of currencies\u2014Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum\u2014and all of those have values that fluctuate wildly with the market.\n\nBitcoin, for example, was valued at around $20,000 last September when Polis announced the crypto tax option, but is currently hovering around $30,000. That means that, if it was used to pay, say, a $1,000 state tax, the taxpayer would need roughly 0.033 Bitcoin today. But if you tried to pay that same $1,000 state tax last September when Bitcoin was valued a third lower? You would have needed 0.05 Bitcoin.\n\nTom Koceja, a Greenwood Village\u2013based accountant who specializes in crypto taxes, says most of his clients prefer to pay for services (including paying him) using a different kind of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, many of which mimic the U.S. dollar and are pegged to $1 each. The other class of fluctuating cryptocurrencies, like the four that PayPal accepts, necessitate a gain or loss calculation because PayPal essentially sells the asset when users make a payment, Koceja says.\n\nIn other words, there could be an additional capital gains tax. If the crypto asset has appreciated in value since the time a user originally bought it\u2014say, Bitcoin that\u2019s gone from $20,000 to $30,000\u2014that filer is subject to capital gains tax when PayPal sells the asset during a payment transaction. \u201cAnd most people aren\u2019t going to pay in [a currency] that creates another tax obligation for them,\u201d Koceja says.\n\nAnd if an asset has depreciated? A person might also be reluctant to sell it at a loss (which, following a down year for crypto last year, could explain why so few Coloradans paid their state taxes in crypto).\n\nLike Paller of ETHDenver, Koceja says the state\u2019s system needs improvement in order to increase participation among crypto users. \u201cIt\u2019s convoluted,\u201d he says of the current option. But of the future, the accountant says, \u201cI think it\u2019s cool that the Department of Revenue did this. To see them start this is neat.\u201d\n\nWith some changes, he adds, he thinks Colorado will see more crypto users pay their taxes in blockchain assets. \u201cI think with payment in stablecoins, more marketing around it, and maybe a wallet address [operated by the state] where people could directly send their crypto, we\u2019re not that far off,\u201d he says. And pretty soon, Koceja says it won\u2019t just be Colorado that we\u2019re sending stablecoins to to pay for things like income taxes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see this kind of thing all over the place, and it\u2019ll be preferable,\u201d he promises."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week under $30,000 as analysts\u2019 predictions of a short-term support retest come true.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency saw a classic dive following its latest weekly close as the latest gains evaporated, but will they return?\n\nAhead of a fairly innocuous week for macro data releases, catalysts are likely to come elsewhere as BTC price action decides on a key support zone.\n\nMuch is at stake for traders, as the week prior offered the opportunity to reinvestigate altcoins as Bitcoin itself cooled its upside. With a retracement now in effect, attention will be on whether those altcoins can hold at their own higher levels.\n\nUnder the hood, it appears to be business as usual for Bitcoin, with network fundamentals already at or near all-time highs, showing no definitive signs of a comedown this week.\n\nIt may be too early to determine how price performance will impact hodlers, but the temptation to sell at 10-month highs must be clear, with the percentage of the overall BTC supply now in profit at an impressive 75%.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at these factors and more in the weekly rundown of potential Bitcoin price triggers.\n\nBTC price: $30,000 hangs in the balance\n\nAfter a \u201cboring\u201d weekend for BTC price action, volatility returned in classic style at the April 16 weekly close.\n\nWith it came a return to $30,000 for BTC/USD, marking its first major support retest since hitting 10-month highs above $31,000 last week.\n\nTraders and analysts had widely predicted the move, arguing that it would constitute a healthy retracement to prepare for the continuation of the uptrend.\n\nRe-bought everything that I took profit on.\n\n\n\nI'll reduce below $29.7K BTC and $2K on ETH.\n\n\n\nWorst case scenario, I make a little less money on the overall positions. Best case scenario, I make a lot of money.\n\n\n\nBut generally speaking, risk is definable enough for me to re-enter. https://t.co/WH3vUVciY8 \u2014 Loma (@LomahCrypto) April 16, 2023\n\nCointelegraph contributor Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, was among those eyeing a buy-in just below $30,000 but kept his options open in the case of a deeper correction.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is getting towards the long areas. Back towards the range low, through which a sweep can be granted as an entry point towards $32K,\u201d he told Twitter followers.\n\n\u201c$28,600 could also be a long entry, but then I think we won\u2019t be starting to make new highs, for now.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

While developments have been technically bullish since the October lows markets are near these key resistance points with the $VIX on the floor of its multi year uptrend,\u201d Henrich continued.\n\n\u201cWill recent liquidity injections, which have contributed to suppressed volatility, be enough to sustain a move above resistance as the economy is approaching a recession per the Fed staff?

I certainly know do,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCrypto \u201cgreed\u201d inches from November 2021 peak\n\nBitcoin may be far from its all-time high of $69,000, but one metric rapidly homing in on repeating the climate of November 2021 is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index.\n\nRelated: What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index?\n\nThe return to $30,000 was marked by a rapid increase in \u201cgreed\u201d throughout the crypto market, its data shows.\n\nAs of April 17, Fear & Greed scored 69/100, just 10% away from its 75/100 mark from when BTC/USD traded at its most recent peak.\n\nCointelegraph has often reported on the potentially overheated atmosphere within sentiment this year, and now nerves appear to be spreading.\n\n\u201cNow this isn\u2019t a metric I swear by as it is lagging, but it gives a good indication of when to look to de-risk and be cautious,\u201d popular trader Crypto Tony reasoned about the Index over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe last time we came up to the 75 region was back on November 7th 2021 when Bitcoin was trading at over $65,000.

        "title": "Bitcoin Thief Once Worth $3.4 Billion Gets Year in Prison - HT Tech",
        "content": "A Georgia man who stole more than 50,000 Bitcoin from the Silk Road drug-trafficking site before his cache hit $3.35 billion in value was ordered to serve a year and a day in prison.\n\nJames Zhong, 32, was sentenced Friday in New York federal court, where he pleaded guilty to wire fraud last year. At the time of the heist in 2012, the Bitcoin was worth $620,000. When authorities seized devices holding the stolen Bitcoin in November 2021, its value had exploded, making it the second-largest financial seizure in US history.\n\nBefore he was caught, Zhong spent $16 million of the proceeds on real estate investments, luxury hotels, nightclubs and Lamborghinis, prosecutors said. The value of the Bitcoin seized is now about $1.56 billion.\n\nUS District Judge Paul Gardephe cited the \u201chighly sophisticated nature of the crime\u201d and Zhong's active concealment of the stolen Bitcoin for nine years until agents raided his house. Zhong faced between 27 and 33 months in prison under advisory guidelines, but Gardephe said he was granting leniency because of the \u201ctruly unique circumstances\u201d in the case. Still, the judge said he also wanted to deter other criminals.\n\n\u201cWhile the victim in this case happened to be a criminal enterprise, the victim tomorrow could be a legitimate business,\u201d Gardephe said.\n\nProsecutors told the judge that Zhong should get prison because he covered up his theft for nearly a decade, moving the Bitcoin through so-called mixers that make it harder to trace transactions by jumbling tokens together. But they also said he should get less than two years in prison, citing his youth, his autism and his help in recovering the stolen crypto.\n\nSolace in Computer\n\nZhong's lawyers asked the judge to spare him a prison term, saying he came from a dysfunctional family and received no love from his divorced parents, who were Chinese immigrants. He was \u201cseverely bullied and victimized by his peers because he was different \u2014 he was extremely shy, overweight, and most significantly, suffered from undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder,\u201d Zhong's lawyers said in court papers. \u201cHaving no friends or family he could turn to, Jimmy found solace and friendship in the world of his computer.\u201d\n\nIn court, Zhong expressed \u201cshame and remorse,\u201d and told the judge, \u201cI always knew what I did was wrong.\u201d\n\nHe said he hid his crimes as Bitcoin soared in value.\n\n\u201cI think I buried my head in the sand,\u201d Zhong said. \u201cIt made me feel important and worth something.\u201d\n\nZhong said that while some college friends have stuck by him, the one who's been most supportive is his dog Chad, who is old and sick.\n\nIn their sentencing memo, Zhong's lawyers argued that while he had no right to the stolen Bitcoin, neither did Silk Road. They said the marketplace isn't a victim \u201cin the true sense of the word\u201d under the law, noting that Silk Road's imprisoned founder, Ross Ulbricht, contacted Zhong and asked him how he took the cryptocurrency. But he never asked for it back \u2014 and sent more.\n\nAfter pleading guilty, Zhong agreed to forfeit $42.7 million as well as additional Bitcoin and property.\n\nThe heist began after Zhong had stored some Bitcoin on Silk Road, the online black market. When he double-clicked the withdrawal button by mistake, he got back twice as much as he put in. Over several days, he deposited more tokens and quickly withdrew them, double-clicking each time. Exploiting that glitch led him to more than 50,000 Bitcoin, each worth about $12 at the time.\n\nFederal agents seized 50,491 Bitcoin from Zhong's lakefront home in Gainesville, Georgia, along with $661,900 in cash and gold and silver bars. Zhong stored the crypto on devices in a safe under floorboards and on a single-board computer stowed in a Cheetos popcorn tin in a closet. He later surrendered more than 1,000 additional Bitcoin.\n\nZhong attended the University of Georgia from 2008 to 2014, earning a bachelor's degree in computer science and mining Bitcoin. He also drank excessively and used cocaine, according to a psychiatric examination report in his court file.\n\nHe converted some Bitcoin to $700,000 in cash, so he would have a \u201ccase full of money like in the movies,\u201d the report said. \u201cHe hoped the visual appeal of the cash would impress a female into having sexual relations with him,\u201d the report said. \u201cHe stated his plan did not work.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Zhong reported a burglary at his home his Athens, Georgia, saying someone had stolen a silver brief case with $400,000 in cash."

        "title": "Postage Prices Just Went Up Again. Here's How Much Stamps Cost Now - CNET",
        "content": "What's happening The price of first-class stamps, packages and other services went up on Jan. 22. Why it matters The rate hike is due partly to the US Postal Service's massive debt: The agency has an annual budget deficit of $10 billion.\n\nThe US Postal Service raised the price of stamps on Sunday, with a first-class stamp going from 60 to 63 cents.\n\nPrices for international mail and metered letters also rose, as did fees for post office boxes, money orders and other special services.\n\nStamps just rose to 60 cents in July 2022, up from 58 cents. The National Postal Policy Council, a trade association for corporations that use stamped mail, called the back-to-back increases \"unwelcome burdens.\"\n\nBut the Postal Service says the new rates are still \"competitive.\"\n\n\"Prices of the US Postal Service remain among the most affordable in the world,\" the agency said in a statement in October.\n\nHere's what you need to know about stamp prices, including what the new rates are and what you can do to delay paying more.\n\nRead more: What's the Cheapest Way to Ship: UPS, FedEx or US Postal Service?\n\nHow much is the price of stamps going up?\n\nThe cost of first-class mail went up about 4.2% on average. First-class stamps increased from 60 cents to 63 cents, while international letters and postcards jumped from $1.40 to $1.45.\n\nProduct Previous price Current price Letters (1 ounce) 60 cents 63 cents Letters (metered 1 ounce) 57 cents 60 cents Domestic postcards 44 cents 48 cents International postcards $1.40 $1.45 International letter (1 ounce) $1.40 $1.45\n\n\n\nYou can buy stamps at online retailers like Amazon or directly at the US Postal Service website.\n\nDid shipping rates increase, too?\n\nThe US Postal Service increased the cost of sending packages via Priority Mail by about 5.5%. Priority Mail Express became 6.6% more expensive, First Class Package Service prices were bumped up by 7.8% and Priority Mail commercial rates increased by about 3.6%.\n\nThe new rates are still \"well below the rate of inflation,\" the Postal Service said in a statement.\n\nThere was no price increase for Parcel Select Ground or USPS Connect Local, which allows businesses to offer same-day and next-day delivery for local customers.\n\nMore detailed pricing information can be found on the Postal Service's Postal Explorer website.\n\nDomestic Priority Mail Flat Rate changes Product Previous New Small flat-rate box $10.40 $10.20 Medium flat-rate box $17.05 $17.10 Large flat-rate box $22.45 $22.80 APO/FPO large flat-rate box $20.95 $21.20 Regular flat-rate envelope $9.90 $9.65 Legal flat-rate envelope $10.20 $9.95 Padded flat-rate envelope $10.60 $10.40\n\nWill the post office raise prices again?\n\nIt's definitely possible. The rate hikes are part of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's 10-year Delivering for America plan, intended to chip away at the Postal Service's mammoth debt.\n\nThe agency has an annual budget deficit of $10 billion and, at the end of fiscal year 2020, was carrying $188 billion in debts and unfunded liabilities, the Government Accountability Office reported -- mostly from underfunding of workers' pensions and retiree health care benefits.\n\nThe Postal Service generally receives no tax dollars for operating expenses, relying on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.\n\nDeJoy's plans include increasing postage rates, lengthening delivery times and reducing post office hours. In October 2021, the Postal Service started lengthening delivery times for about a third of its volume, meaning that letters, parcels and magazines that took two or three days can now take up to five to arrive.\n\nThe nonprofit NPCC urged the Postal Regulatory Commission to consider whether it could discourage the Postal Service from filing multiple rate changes in a 12-month period. The Commission countered that \"nothing in the statute or regulations dictates the frequency of price adjustments or the timing of when they are to occur.\"\n\nIt encouraged the Postal Service to set a schedule for price adjustments \"that minimizes costs and disruptions.\""

The latest prediction is that the queen of cryptocurrencies could reach a market capitalization of $10 trillion. Even macro guru Dan Tapiero is convinced that this could come true.\n\nDan Tapiero predicts that Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization will reach $10 trillion!\n\nBitcoin continues to impress analysts, who predict a glorious future for the queen of cryptocurrencies. Its recent rise beyond $25,000 has raised excitement, and many analysts are predicting a continued rise in prices. Some see Bitcoin reaching $100,000.\n\nFund manager Dan Tapiero agrees! In an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Tapiero predicted that Bitcoin would reach a market capitalization of 10 trillion. He believes the cryptocurrency could break through its current $600 billion line to reach a 14-figure score.\n\n\u201cSomewhere between 5 \u2013 8 trillion dollars. Do I think it can go to $10 trillion? Sure, absolutely. It can absolutely go to $10 trillion\u201d\n\nAccording to Dan Tapiero, the total value of all crypto assets is expected to increase by over 600% from current levels. For him, the crypto industry goes far beyond money, value storage, programmable contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT) and stablecoins. It now includes everything.\n\nAnd when it comes to the price of bitcoin, Tapiero believes it can reach a remarkable high of anywhere from $300,000 to $500,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying the same thing for a while, and I think $300,000 to $500,000 is a good solid spot given the value of other assets in the world.\u201d he says.\n\nAt the time of writing, the combined market capitalization of crypto assets was about $1.34 billion. There\u2019s no guarantee that Tapiero\u2019s prediction will come true.

        "title": "Gotcha Zhong! Bitcoins have an anonymity problem - Finshots",
        "content": "Remember the time when experts said that cryptocurrencies are anonymous?\n\nWell\u2026there\u2019s a problem with that statement. In today\u2019s Finshots, we tell you the story of how authorities tracked down someone who stole Bitcoins many many years ago.\n\nThe Story\n\nIn 2013, Bitcoin had one promise \u2014 anonymity.\n\nIf you wanted to sell drugs. You could hop onto the dark web and find a buyer. You\u2019d ask them to send the Bitcoins to your wallet. And no one would know who you were. It was like dealing in cash without leaving a trace. And since there were no wads of cash to lug around, it was easy peasy. No one would know what you\u2019d even bought.\n\nAnd law enforcement had no answers. It was all very new to everyone. Bitcoins and blockchain were exotic words that would cause a headache. So dubious individuals took advantage of this relative anonymity. Drug deals happened\n\nBut it looks like they had a little too much faith in the promise of bitcoin. Just ask James Zhong who was sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in prison on Friday.\n\nNearly a decade ago, Zhong was a 22-year-old college student who wanted to buy some drugs. Cocaine to be specific. So he decided to try out this infamous online marketplace called the Silk Road that everyone was talking about. And since it was a platform for all sorts of nefarious activities, Silk Road only dealt with Bitcoin. You know, for the privilege of promised anonymity.\n\nBut while Zhong ventured into the website for drugs, he found a bug instead. A coding error. He tried to withdraw some Bitcoins from his Silk Road account and he inadvertently double-clicked the \u2018withdraw\u2019 button. Silk Road glitched and processed the transaction twice. Even though he didn\u2019t have that many Bitcoins in the account in the first place.\n\nZhong found that he could simply steal Bitcoins directly from Silk Road\u2019s wallet. And as per US Law Enforcement, once Zhong realized what was happening, he quickly created 9 different accounts on Silk Road. All for the purpose of exploiting this bug. He went on a double-clicking spree and managed to get hold of 50,000 Bitcoins. Which is worth a whopping $1.5 billion in today\u2019s value by the way.\n\nNow, Silk Road was shut down in 2013. The US authorities went after the founder for abetting illegal activities. But no one knew Zhong. Even though the Silk Road computers that were seized had all the records. People knew that Bitcoin had been stolen. But nothing revealed Zhong\u2019s identity. And for 8 years, he kept moving money from one account to another.\n\nAnd he could spend the money willy-nilly too. He spent $16 million hosting parties on chartered planes and boats. Took people to sporting events and hotels. He was living the high life. Oh, he even bought himself a Lamborghini.\n\nSo, how was Zhong trapped in the end?\n\nA classic slip-up. Zhong transferred some of his ill-gotten Bitcoins to another account where he held legitimate funds.\n\nBut wait\u2026how did authorities know that Zhong had actually stolen those Bitcoins in the first place?\n\nAh, that\u2019s the part about anonymity. See, there are a couple of things that people like Zhong forget.\n\nFirstly, there are some very smart people in the world who like to solve really hard problems. And one of those problems was about how to crack the anonymity of Bitcoins. There was no precedent. No course they could watch on YouTube. They just had to figure it out on their own.\n\nTake researcher, Sarah Meiklejohn for instance. In 2013, she was one of the first people in the world to go down a rabbit hole to figure out if the blockchain was really anonymous. She got a massive data dump and started to work. She wanted to find patterns. She figured out ways to cluster these addresses for transactions.\n\nShe went undercover. Got involved in a few illegal transactions on Silk Road too. And then, when she had to make a Bitcoin transfer, she\u2019d know the address of the person she interacted with. She\u2019d go back, look at her dump of data and find it within a cluster. Voila!\n\nAfter this, it was just about following the money trail. Watch it move from one address to another.\n\nAnd then, wait for the owners to cash out their Bitcoins. Because at some point, they can\u2019t simply keep dealing in Bitcons. They need to convert it into hard cash. Into dollars. And they typically need a crypto exchange to do the deed. Now, since exchanges take a lot of Know Your Customer (KYC) information these days, once you have a solid money trail linked to a suspect Bitcoin deal, you simply pounce when they cash out.\n\nIn fact, tracking Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies used in nefarious activities is such a booming business now that one of the largest in the space is a company called Chainalysis that\u2019s valued at a whopping $8.6 billion. Law enforcement is in love with them too.\n\nAnd finally, people forget that the blockchain is forever. Those transactions from 2013? That\u2019ll be available for the public to see for eternity. So if anything even smells a little bit funny, the cops can simply go back in time and track down all these dubious transactions.\n\nIt\u2019s not like cash at all. Oops.\n\nAnyway, with Zhong, once law enforcement knew that there was a link between the Silk Road bitcoins and this separate wallet, they simply asked the Bitcoin exchange for the IP address. They tracked it down. And knocked down the door to find his loot all stashed away inside digital devices. Even in a tin of popcorn!\n\nSo is the promise of cryptocurrency anonymity over then?\n\nWell, clearly it\u2019s not as robust as people originally believed. Bitcoin is part of a much larger ecosystem with multiple intermediaries who all have flaws in them. So perhaps true anonymity will always remain a distant dream.\n\nBut there are others slowly trying to tighten the screws. For instance, there\u2019s a cryptocurrency called monero that argues it\u2019s more private than Bitcoin. And the new hot thing is another currency called zcash which claims it uses advanced tech to make sure that detecting ownership is nearly impossible.\n\nSee, this is like a cat-and-mouse game. Regulators devise ingenious ways to break anonymity and track users. And then someone creates another crypto that\u2019s one step ahead of the tracking tech. The cycle will continue\n\nBut here\u2019s a warning to anyone thinking of using monero or zcash for illicit gains. Remember \u2014 nothing is private forever. Today it might be. Tomorrow it might not be. And when the authorities go digging into the past. You\u2019ll likely be found out.\n\nUntil then\u2026\n\nDon't forget to share this article on WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Twitter\n\nDitto Insights: Why Millennials should buy a term plan\n\nAccording to a survey, only 17% of Indian millennials (25\u201335 yrs) have bought term insurance. The actual numbers are likely even lower.\n\nAnd the more worrying fact is that 55% hadn\u2019t even heard of term insurance!\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nOne common misconception is the dependent conundrum. Most millennials we spoke to want to buy a term policy because they want to cover their spouse and kids. And this makes perfect sense. After all, in your absence you want your term policy to pay out a large sum of money to cover your family\u2019s needs for the future. But these very same people don\u2019t think of their parents as dependents even though they support them extensively. I remember the moment it hit me. I routinely send money back home, but I had never considered my parents as my dependents. And when a colleague spoke about his experience, I immediately put two and two together. They were dependent on my income and my absence would most certainly affect them financially. So a term plan was a no-brainer for me.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why millennials should probably consider looking at a term plan \u2014 Debt. Most people we spoke to have home loans, education loans and other personal loans with a considerable interest burden. In their absence, this burden would shift to their dependents. It\u2019s not something most people think of, but it happens all the time.\n\nFinally, you actually get a pretty good bargain on term insurance prices when you\u2019re younger. The idea is to pay a nominal sum every year (something that won\u2019t burn your pocket) to protect your dependents in the event of your untimely demise. And this fee is lowest when you\u2019re young.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a millennial and you\u2019re reading this, maybe you should reconsider buying a term plan.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has failed again to remain above its critical psychological level at $30,000, and it\u2019s currently trading at $29,500. As of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency in the market seems poised to revisit lower levels to regain its bullish momentum. Most altcoins are reaching new highs and gaining dominance.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Hits Range Highs\n\nDaan Crypto, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently commented on the relationship between Bitcoin\u2019s price and its dominance in the cryptocurrency market. According to Daan, when Bitcoin dominance hits the top of its range, it often precedes a move down to the bottom of the range.\n\nTo illustrate this point, Daan marked out three previous periods where BTC.D hit (near) the top of the range and moved down to the bottom. The range that Daan marked out sits at approximately 39-49%.\n\nDuring the first move down on BTC.D in the summer of 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s price remained flat with a slight upward trend. However, during the second move down on BTC.D from October 2021 to January 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a significant correction, dropping from the $60K region to the $40K region.\n\nThe third move down on BTC.D in the summer of 2022 saw Bitcoin\u2019s price drop from approximately $30K to $20K. We are again witnessing a rejection from the Bitcoin dominance range highs, which could signal a potential move down to the bottom of the range.\n\nAs reported by NewsBTC, Bitcoin has a near-term support level of $29,500. This level was previously a strong resistance but has now flipped to become an essential support for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency experiences a further decline, the $28,600 level is expected to serve as another key support floor.\n\nRed Months For BTC Incoming?\n\nOnchain Edge, a crypto analyst, recently examined the historical price performance of Bitcoin during May and June over the past 10 years. The analysis revealed five red and five green months in May, indicating a 50% chance of either outcome.\n\nFurthermore, there has only been one other year, 2013, where Bitcoin had four green months in a row, suggesting that predicting the May price trend is challenging. However, the analysis also looked at the performance of Bitcoin in June, where the trend continuation was observed in seven out of ten months.\n\nIf May was red, then June was also red, and if May was green, then June was also green. This trend indicates that June\u2019s price performance highly depends on May\u2019s performance.\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin has experienced a decline of over 3% in the last 24 hours. If Bitcoin\u2019s dominance coincides with a potential red month of May, then bulls may face a challenging ride ahead. However, it is worth noting that the tides of the crypto winter seem to be fully in order, indicating that bulls may need to exercise patience.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "While many investors and enthusiasts have been asking, \"Is crypto dead?\", much of the focus is on the role of regulatory measures in the United States. In fact, billionaire tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya claims that \"crypto is dead in America\" due to strict regulations imposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler has been quite vocal about his concerns over the crypto industry. He believes that crypto trading platforms should adhere to strict U.S. securities laws, emphasizing the need for stringent regulatory measures. Palihapitiya critiqued Gensler's stance, saying, \"The United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto,\" attributing this aggressive approach to the perceived threat that cryptocurrencies pose to the traditional financial establishment.\n\nThat said, Palihapitiya also acknowledges that some blame lies with the crypto sector, stating, \"In fairness to the regulators, [the crypto sector] did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy.\" As a result, good actors in the industry are now \"paying the price\" for the actions of those who pushed the boundaries.\n\nThe impact of U.S. regulations on cryptocurrencies can be seen in the growing list of enforcement actions taken against various crypto firms. For example, the SEC has issued warnings to Coinbase and charged the crypto trading platform Bittrex and its ex-CEO with operating an unregistered exchange. These actions, along with the proposed rules changing the way crypto firms can custody customer assets, have caused significant uncertainty in the industry.\n\nOn the other hand, critics argue that these stringent regulations are driving innovation overseas and endangering American competitiveness. With influential figures like Chamath Palihapitiya raising concerns over the future of cryptocurrencies in the U.S., it's clear that the regulatory landscape will have a significant impact on whether or not crypto can recover.\n\nIt's important to note that despite the current challenges, the possibility of crypto recovering and achieving new heights cannot be ruled out. As the regulatory environment evolves and becomes more accommodating, the potential for a resurgence in the crypto market remains ever-present. Until then, investors and enthusiasts alike continue to ponder the question: \"Is crypto dead?\""

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have unique features that make them unlike any other asset class, such as Forex or equities. For this reason, cryptocurrencies pose unique challenges to how Islamic scholars interpret Islamic (Shariah) laws to recommend whether trading or owning cryptocurrencies is halal (permissible) or haram (forbidden).\n\nThis article explores that debate. To be clear, it is a debate\u2014unlike interest payments, or the consumption of alcohol, Islamic scholars and the Muslim community have not reached a consensus on whether cryptocurrencies should be considered Halal or Haram, and they maybe never will because of subjective interpretations of cryptocurrencies\u2019 role in modern economies.\n\nTo help us lay the foundation for understanding the debate, let\u2019s start by learning some of the essential attributes of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nHere are five key things to know about how Cryptocurrencies work.\n\nUnlike traditional currencies such as Euros or US Dollars, neither governments nor central banks issue cryptocurrencies. Instead, independent groups can create a cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency stored on a technology called blockchain. In other words, the blockchain comes first, and a cryptocurrency sits on it. Blockchain technology is a decentralized record-keeping system. Unlike conventional record-keeping methods, such as financial records kept by accountants, a blockchain uses a computer network to make new entries visible to everyone. That means there is no central authority controlling a single ledger. Instead, everyone that is a part of the system controls a decentralized and shared record. Researchers invented the concept of blockchain to enable the creation of Bitcoin. Because blockchain technology is technically independent of cryptocurrencies, industries now use decentralized blockchain record-keeping systems for other reasons\u2014for example, manufacturers use it for supply chain management, and governments have started experimenting with blockchain for health records. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, launched in 2009. Today, Bitcoin is still the largest cryptocurrency, followed by Ethereum. In the case of Bitcoin, anyone can potentially create a new Bitcoin by solving a complex mathematical or cryptographic problem\u2014this process is known as \u201cmining.\u201d Bitcoin mining uses tremendous computing power and energy to the point that mining is environmentally damaging. Because of the mathematical structure of Bitcoin, there is a maximum number of Bitcoin that can exist in the future.\n\nCryptocurrency is unregulated (mostly).\n\nBy their very nature, cryptocurrencies are not backed by real assets, governments, or central banks. Anyone can create a cryptocurrency and sell coins to the public with the right technology and team.\n\nAs you can imagine, when cryptocurrencies first appeared in the early 2010s, the industry was like the wild west, much like Forex was in the early 2000s. Slowly but surely, jurisdictions like the US and Europe have started to regulate aspects of cryptocurrencies. However, there is a long way to go\u2014they are not regulated in the same way as traditional currencies. From that perspective, the public should be cautious and not assume they will receive the same protections with cryptocurrencies as regulated banks give to cash deposits.\n\nIslamic Finance Principles\n\nTo provide a framework for the debate surrounding whether cryptocurrencies are halal or haram, let\u2019s consider three main Islamic finance principles: Wealth must be generated from legitimate trade and asset-based investment. The use of money to make money is expressly forbidden. Investment should also have a social and ethical benefit to broader society beyond pure return. Risk should be shared.\n\nTo allow Muslims to act within these principles, there are several activities which are prohibited under Shariah law:\n\nCharging and receiving interest (riba). Investing in businesses dealing with alcohol, gambling, drugs, pork, pornography, or other areas that Shariah considers unlawful. Speculation or extreme risk. Uncertainty about the subject matter and terms of contracts\u2014this includes selling something one does not own, e.g., short-selling.\n\nConsidering the above ideas of Shariah law, let\u2019s look at the Shariah-compliant debate around crypto.\n\nWhy Do Some People Consider Crypto Haram?\n\nReason 1: Cryptocurrency is not money.\n\nA defining feature of a currency is that it acts as a medium of exchange or store of wealth. Many Shariah experts believe that in the modern world, only governments or their central banks can issue currencies that meet the defining features of money. Because cryptocurrencies operate outside the realms of governments and the banking system, many Islamic scholars do not view cryptocurrencies as a true currency category. Remember, even though cryptocurrencies can be an \u201calternative investment asset,\u201d that does not make them an \u201calternative medium of exchange,\u201d i.e., the widely accepted definition of money.\n\nReason 2: Cryptocurrencies are only speculative without intrinsic value. Therefore, they are a form of gambling.\n\nCryptocurrencies are solely mathematical constructs sitting on digital networks. Without the tangible backing of a government or central bank, many Islamic scholars argue that cryptocurrencies, by definition, have no intrinsic value. Without intrinsic value, some Islamic scholars view cryptocurrencies as solely speculative instruments with purely hypothetical value. That leads them to reason that trading cryptocurrencies is gambling, which is haram or forbidden under Shariah law.\n\nReason 3: Cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activities.\n\nBecause cryptocurrency allows for direct \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d transactions made via the internet, only two parties are involved in the activity. No banks, governments or intermediaries are necessary. This makes cryptocurrency transactions much more anonymous. It is important to note that cryptocurrency dealings are not one hundred percent anonymous\u2014law enforcement agencies have found ways to track cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nCriminals are drawn to the increased anonymity of cryptocurrencies. As a result, Bitcoin, for example, has a significantly high proportion of illegal use, such as money laundering or drug trafficking. Some market experts even argue that the only reason to want to use cryptocurrencies rather than traditional currencies is for illegal activities.\n\nReason 4: Cryptocurrency is a high-risk investment.\n\nCryptocurrencies have exceptionally high volatility compared to traditional currencies. Let\u2019s compare Bitcoin to the world\u2019s most widely traded Forex pair, EUR/USD. Since the Euro started trading in Jan 1999, EUR/USD has had a range of 0.83 to 1.60. In other words, the Euro\u2019s entire range from its lowest point to its highest point saw it double in value. And this range played out over decades, not months. In comparison, Bitcoin moved from under $10 a coin in mid-2011 to $69,000 at its high in November 2021, over 7,000 times higher! It then lost 75% of its value in only a few months. Imagine the Euro gaining value against the USD 7,000 times over or losing 75% of its value in a few months! European economies trying to import raw materials or export goods would be unable to function. The volatility of Bitcoin prohibits it from working as a regular currency. Bitcoin is also extremely volatile compared to established equity indexes such as the S&P 500. Shariah scholars often cite cryptocurrency\u2019s excessive volatility as another reason they are haram.\n\nReason 5: Cryptocurrency is not regulated.\n\nThe crypto space is generally unregulated, and as such it has attracted some dubious actors who have launched coins or other ancillary crypto services which are either complete or partial scams.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine why some Islamic finance experts consider cryptocurrencies permissible, or halal.\n\nHow Can Cryptocurrencies Be Halal?\n\nReason 1: Contractual certainty.\n\nUnder Shariah law, a contract is valid if a contractual consideration is present, known as \u201cmal.\u201d That means there must be an exchange of something that can be owned, stored, and traded. Cryptos are real digital assets that can be owned and stored electronically in digital wallets. They can be traded on exchanges, which some countries now regulate.\n\nReason 2: Free of interest (riba).\n\nCryptocurrencies do not have a built-in element of interest or riba. Of course, not having interest does not automatically make cryptocurrencies halal\u2014other attributes can make them haram. However, much of the international capital markets revolve around interest payments, and having an asset class without interest is a big plus for Shariah-conscious investors.\n\nReason 3: Volatility is not haram by itself.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are used to speculate and take excessive risk, some experts state that volatility is not enough of a reason to consider cryptocurrency as haram. Volatility is present in all markets, and excessive risk is often taken because investors do not manage their capital correctly. For example, an equity trader might put too much of their capital into a single stock that does not perform, thereby damaging a large part of their account value. However, that does not make equity investing haram. Investors can put smaller amounts of their capital in a cryptocurrency because of its volatility, thereby not taking excessive risk.\n\nReason 4: Illegal use of cryptocurrencies by others does not make it haram.\n\nCriminals use traditional currencies like US Dollars or Euros for illegal activities. It\u2019s not as if criminal usage of money only started with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009! Similarly, for decades, criminals have used stocks to make trades using insider information. Islamic finance experts that consider cryptocurrencies halal point to the motive of the investor being haram and not the underlying asset itself as haram.\n\nReason 6: Cryptocurrencies are already used as currencies by some.\n\nShariah scholars that support cryptocurrencies as halal argue that the lack of a central authority strengthens their value as currencies. It means no single authority can manipulate the money supply, ensuring market transparency. Furthermore, many are already using cryptocurrencies as mediums of exchange, even if it is not a dominant vehicle. For example, some companies accept cryptocurrencies as payments for goods and services. This already gives cryptocurrencies purchasing power, where buyers and sellers use them to facilitate transactions.\n\nIs Cryptocurrency Halal or Haram?\n\nBoth sides of the debate have supporters qualified to issue fatwas and have put forward intellectually sound arguments. This makes it difficult for ordinary Muslims to decide either way. Cryptocurrencies are new, and as they evolve\u2014for example, more parts of society accept them as payments or governments fully regulate cryptocurrencies, or new types of cryptocurrencies emerge\u2014the debate will also evolve. It is conceivable that muftis will issue new fatwas based on new market conditions in the future.\n\nAt the present time, Shariah-conscious investors must decide individually whether to proceed with cryptocurrencies or not. Of course, not all cryptocurrencies are the same\u2014you may deem some halal and others haram. And the decision may depend on how you wish to use cryptocurrencies. For example, is it for speculation or purchasing goods and services? These factors will affect your decision.\n\nFatwa on Cryptocurrency\u2014Opinions of Shariah Scholars\n\nA fatwa is a legal ruling on a point of Islamic law (Shariah) given by a qualified faqih (Islamic jurist). A jurist that issues fatwas is called a \u201cmufti.\u201d\n\nThe following is not a comprehensive review of fatwas regarding cryptocurrencies\u2014instead, it is a sampling of ideas in the field.\n\nJanuary 2018: Egypt's top Imam, Sheikh Shawki Allam, the grand mufti, endorsed a ban on trading in Bitcoin by declaring it \"forbidden\" by Islam. He said, \u201cBitcoin carries risks of \u201cfraudulence, lack of knowledge, and cheating. Bitcoin is forbidden in Shariah as it causes harm to individuals, groups and institutions. It is used directly to fund terrorists.\u201d February 2021: Mufti Faraz Adam wrote in his book, \u201cIntroduction to Islamic Fintech,\u201d that he regards many cryptocurrencies as digital assets and that cryptocurrencies with a lawful utility can be deemed as property from a Shariah perspective. Later in his career, he states, \u201cBitcoin will be a currency as long as people use and exchange them. A system which is acceptable among people is sufficient to establish a currency in Shariah.\u201d Because there are various types of crypto-assets, Mufti Faraz recommends screening them for Shariah compliance before investing. His screening criteria are: Legitimacy screening\u2014ensure that the specific cryptocurrency is a genuine project, not a scam. Project screening\u2014ensure that the project is Shariah compliant, e.g., does not require interest. Financials screening\u2014ensuring that it meets the financial criteria for Shariah compliance if it is an equity-based token. Token screening\u2014understanding the Shariah compliance of the token. Staking screening\u2014understanding the Shariah compliance of the staking mechanism. September 2022: Abdulkader Hallak, a wealth advisor at Sarwa, a Dubai, UAE-based firm, believes that volatility is an insufficient reason to consider cryptocurrency as haram. He believes the motive of the investor matters more. He says, \u201cIf you\u2019re not using any leverage or CFDs, and you\u2019re not gambling and taking excessive risk, then this draws the line. What is your goal behind investing in crypto? Is it to accumulate your wealth? Are you using crypto as a store of value? Then that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nBottom Line\n\nBoth sides have solid arguments as to whether cryptocurrencies are halal or haram.\n\nThose that deem cryptocurrencies to be haram (forbidden) cite that they have no intrinsic value, are purely speculative, are excessively risky, do not fit the definition of a currency, and are mainly used for illicit purposes. Experts that consider cryptocurrencies to be halal believe that even though they are volatile, that does not make them haram. and that many people already use them as currencies to buy and sell goods. Thus, cryptocurrencies already act as money. They also argue that cryptocurrencies are real digital assets that can be owned and stored and traded, which fits the Shariah definition of \u201cmal\u201d or property.\n\nDifferent Muftis have given divergent fatwas and opinions on cryptocurrencies. The debate is fluid and evolving.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs crypto trading haram?\n\nPure speculation is generally considered Haram.\n\nIs crypto futures trading halal or haram?\n\nCrypto futures trading is generally considered Haram.\n\nCan Muslims invest in crypto?\n\nMany Muftis and Shariah scholars agree that Muslims can invest in crypto if the usage is Halal.\n\nIs crypto trading gambling?\n\nMany Muftis consider pure trading of cryptos as haram because it is speculation.\n\nIs short-term crypto trading halal?\n\nMany Muftis consider short-term trading of Cryptos as Haram because it is speculation."

        "title": "Doctors should embrace bitcoin, says cancer surgeon - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "The price of the divisive digital asset has surged 80 per cent this year and was traded at $US29,410 on Tuesday morning, thumping the returns of other asset classes. Over the past five years, it has returned 255.8 per cent as an eclectic mix of professionals, tradies, speculators, mum-and-dad investors, libertarians, and nihilists embrace the mania.\n\nDr Sammour first bought \u201ca few bitcoin in 2015\u201d and has actively bought more since then, but he declined to specifically recommend that healthcare professionals invest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nAlternative option\n\n\u201cMost surgeons will spend their money on more houses or shares,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system teaches them to speculate and I think it\u2019s destructive as it raises house prices for people that don\u2019t have lots of money. Bitcoin might be an alternative option to store wealth without the deleterious societal consequences.\u201d\n\nAustralian doctors are considered to be among the most engaged investors among non-financial professions. According to Australian Taxation Office data, surgeons are Australia\u2019s most prolific real estate speculators, with at least 43 per cent owning an investment property.\n\nDr Sammour said bitcoin should appeal to doctors, given they are being hit with a slew of rising professional costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe British-born bitcoin apostle said US Bureau of Labour Statistics data backed his claim that the average cost of US hospital services had soared 10 per cent per year since 2000 because scarce assets such as hospital beds or luxury properties rose in price faster than assets that were easy to mass-produce such as televisions.\n\nAs a consequence, he said Royal Adelaide Hospital now offered fewer beds per head of population than at any time in history.\n\n\u201cA 2 to 3 per cent increase in [government] funding per year is unlikely to keep up with the cost of delivering the service. That\u2019s why hospital beds are going down, elective surgery lists are getting longer, and ambulance ramping is increasing even though we spend more.\n\n\u201cMedicare and the healthcare system need more funding because the current model is not keeping pace with healthcare inflation or the price of healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see how far house prices go up compared to CPI, you can imagine a hospital bed is more expensive than an apartment bed because it requires a lot of additional resources to staff. If an apartment bed goes up a certain amount per year, you can expect a hospital bed to go up even faster because they\u2019re harder to make.\u201d\n\nTo back up his argument, Dr Sammour said the construction cost of the Royal Adelaide Hospital blew out to $2.4 billion, making it the third most expensive building in history at the time, ahead of more famous global landmarks including the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, London\u2019s The Shard and the Taipei 101 building.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hospital, which spans three city blocks, provides 800 beds to a South Australian catchment area of 1.6 million people at a ratio of one bed to 2000 people.\n\nThis compares with the prior Royal Adelaide Hospital, which was completed in 1967 at the cost of $100 million, and provided 900 beds for a population of 600,000 on a ratio of 1 bed to 800 people.\n\nGoing back to 1877, the city\u2019s hospital cost \u00a350,000 and provided 200 beds for a population of 100,000 on a ratio of 1 bed to 500 people, Dr Sammour said.\n\nThe bitcoin evangelist said central banks\u2019 loose monetary policies had resulted in a misallocation of resources, which rewarded financiers, bankers and asset managers close to the funding source, but harmed unionised healthcare professionals.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s emergence as a new asset class remains controversial because of its huge energy usage, relatively slow processing times, and claims that it relies on the greater fool theory to attract new buyers as early promoters sell out."

        "title": "Bitcoin surged past $US30,000. Is another crypto boom on the way? - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "That alleged wrongdoing has drawn a deluge of regulatory scrutiny and high-profile prosecutions in the US.\n\nAmong the most prominent: FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried is awaiting trial on fraud charges; Do Kwon, co-founder of the Terra blockchain, is facing prosecution for his role in that project\u2019s collapse; Binance and its CEO, Changpeng \u201cC.Z.\u201d Zhao, have been sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a variety of alleged violations; and Coinbase has received notice that the Securities and Exchange Commission intends to sue the company. Binance and Coinbase have denied any wrongdoing; Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThen there is the recent failure of the crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Capital, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. While often cited as a bullish catalyst for bitcoin, since they revived its origin story as an alternative to untrustworthy banks, the downfall of those lenders also severed key links to the US financial system, helping to make the once-promising future of the crypto industry as uncertain as ever.\n\nMany of the retail investors burned by last year\u2019s plunge in prices appear to be licking their wounds, rather than taking on new risk, because the amount of money involved in decentralised finance projects remains subdued.\n\nWhile the total value of coins locked into DeFi projects is up more than 25 per cent since the beginning of January, at about $US50 billion ($74.6 billion) it is still a fraction of the $US180 billion peak reached in December 2021, according to the DeFiLlama website.\n\nAt the same time, thousands of jobs have been lost in the industry and hiring has not picked back up. In a sign of supply of talent still outstripping demand, blockchain project Concordium received more than 350 applications for a couple of recent job openings, said its co-founder and chairman Lars Seier Christensen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe space is maturing a bit, realising that the money tree available a couple of years ago has withered a bit,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestments from venture-capital firms have slowed dramatically. Private funding for crypto start-ups globally fell to $US2.4 billion in the first quarter \u2013 an 80 per cent decline from an all-time high of $US12.3 billion during the same period last year, according to PitchBook.\n\nWait-and-see\n\n\u201cA lot of the industry is still in wait-and-see mode,\u201d said Matteo Dante Perruccio, international president at crypto wealth manager Wave Digital Assets. \u201cThere has been a flight to quality and the beneficiaries are those companies that weren\u2019t hit by the crypto winter.\u201d\n\nAnother way this move higher is different: the eye-popping 83 per cent rally in bitcoin this year has not been matched by newer coins. Ether, which greatly outperformed bitcoin from 2020 and 2021, is up 71 per cent this year. The Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index, which tracks the largest decentralised-finance protocols, has recoupled only about one-tenth of last year\u2019s 2000-point drop.\n\n\u201cWe could be seeing a case of seller exhaustion combined with a renewed bullish narrative following the banking crisis, all mixed with generally low liquidity that has helped BTC\u2019s price toward the upside,\u201d said Clara Medalie, director of research at market-data provider Kaiko.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all of the gloom and uncertainty, progress in the evolution of the industry has continued. Ethereum this week completed what appears to be a successful upgrade to its network. The so-called Shanghai update, which enables investors to withdraw ether coins that they had locked up in exchange for rewards as part of a \u201cproof of stake\u201d system to safeguard the network, could lure billions of dollars into ether \u2013 even after SEC chairman Gary Gensler indicated he believes that token ought to be regulated as a security.\n\nThe price of ether rose back above $US2000 this week for the first time in six months. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s the mania or gusto we saw at $US30k or $US40k, but there is still, behind the scenes, quiet progress,\u201d said Simon Taylor, head of strategy at Sardine, a fraud prevention start-up whose clients include fintech and crypto companies.\n\nThe macro picture has also changed, potentially for the better. A year ago, the Federal Reserve and other central banks were only beginning what would become a series of interest rate rises that reversed a years-long policy of easy money. With the end of that tightening cycle now closer at hand, the conditions may once again be ripe for a crypto boost.\n\nOne big question is how enthusiastic traditional financial institutions will be going forward, and whether they\u2019ll be willing to step in to fill the roles once played by failed crypto start-ups like FTX. There are some indications that could be happening. Nasdaq, for example, expects its custody services for digital assets to launch by the end of the second quarter.\n\nOver the long haul, as much as $US5 trillion may transition into new forms of money, such as central bank digital currencies and stablecoins, by 2030, according to a Citigroup research study. Another $US5 trillion worth of traditional financial assets could be tokenised, helping drive mass adoption of blockchain technologies, according to the report.\n\nEven so, for Michael Purves, CEO of Tallbacken Capital Advisors, the \u201c\u2018show me\u2019 threshold\u201d will be higher this time around for institutional investors, considering the role crypto is meant to play in a portfolio is a moving target. Once touted as a hedge against inflation \u2013 like an internet-age gold \u2013 it instead tumbled during the worst consumer-price surge since the 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstitutions started to take bitcoin seriously after bitcoin broke $US20,000 in 2020 and played a key role in the subsequent rally to $US69,000,\u201d he wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\n\u201cHowever, this time around, its longer-term history of not providing portfolio diversification will weigh heavily on institutions, which probably have bigger headaches to worry about.\u201d\n\nBloomberg"

        "title": "What Is Bitcoin's Price Trajectory Amid The Banking Crisis? You Can Now Become Your Own Bank With Collateral ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As the world grapples with the Silicon Bank crisis, many turn to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) to safeguard their assets in uncertain times. Amid this, Collateral Network (COLT) is emerging as a new challenger lender in the Web3 space, providing a unique solution for people who want to take out loans on their assets.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBecome Your Own Bank With Collateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) enables users to become their own bank. The platform allows peer-to-peer lending and borrowing without intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. This is achieved through smart contracts, which provide a decentralized environment where borrowers can collateralize their physical assets, which banks tend to avoid.\n\nWith Collateral Network (COLT), users can collateralize items such as vintage cars, gold, fine art, real estate, watches, collectibles, and more. These loans can be used for any purpose, like buying a house or starting a business, giving more control over their finances and eliminating the need for traditional banking services.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) issues an NFT backed by the borrower\u2019s tangible asset on a 1:1 ratio, which is then fractionalized and sold to the COLT community at a predetermined interest rate. This approach allows borrowers to access multiple lenders rather than relying on a single one. Also, this minimizes risk as those who intend to lend their crypto can diversify to multiple backed NFTs.\n\nIn the event of a loan default, Collateral Network (COLT) provides a unique solution. The platform lists the authenticated asset on its private auction, only available to Collateral Network (COLT) token holders. On top of that, Collateral Network (COLT) holders receive numerous benefits, such as lower platform fees, staking incentives, and access to VIP groups.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is in its first presale stage, meaning the token is selling at the lowest price it will ever be. Currently, COLT is valued at $0.014, and investors predict it can soon reach $0.35 once the presale is over.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBanking Crisis and Bitcoin\u2019s Price Trajectory: What Can We Expect?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has rallied this past month from $19,955 to over $28,000, despite the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which has caused a domino effect of others going bankrupt. This is mainly due to people wanting to withdraw their funds and banks being unable to provide liquidity. As a result, this has led many to seek out alternative forms of investment and store value, such as Bitcoin (BTC), which has seen a surge in demand after the banking crisis.\n\nHowever, the banking crisis has boosted investors\u2019 confidence, who view digital currency, like Bitcoin (BTC), as an alternative to the traditional banking system. Bitcoin (BTC) has retained its dominance and is on the path to potentially breaking the $30,000 resistance level.\n\nWhile the recent Bitcoin (BTC) rally has been impressive, it\u2019s not uncommon for Bitcoin (BTC) to experience significant price fluctuations in a short period of time. As a result, we may see Bitcoin (BTC) correcting in the near future once the dust has settled after this banking crisis.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "SMALL CAP IDEAS: Where can UK investors find alternative exposure to bitcoin? - This is Money",
        "content": "Those of you with eyes on the markets will know that the best-performing asset class of 2023 has not been equities, real estate, bonds or gold, but bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency borne from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nBitcoin was originally conceived by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto as a decentralised payment network without the need for a third-party financial institution.\n\nWhile bitcoin has failed to cement itself as a genuine cross-border payment network \u2013 primarily due to prohibitive transaction charges and sluggish transaction speeds \u2013 the digital currency has been rebranded by its evangelists as a sort of inflation hedge, an alternative store of value with a finite circulating supply that is impossible to be diluted.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group has teamed up with platform Global Futures and Options to bring regulated bitcoin futures and options products to UK investors for the first time ever\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that since the start of 2023, bitcoin's spot price has skyrocketed over 80 per cent, surging past $30,000 earlier this month for the first time in nine months.\n\nFinancial analysts and Twitter handles will continue to lock horns over the credibility of the so-called 'digital gold', but for the investor seeking to diversify their portfolio without the technical hassles of managing crypto wallets and untrustworthy crypto exchanges, what is the best way to gain exposure?\n\nFor physical gold, the answer is easy: The London Stock Exchange is a global hub for small-cap gold exploration and production groups; Shanta Gold, Caledonia Mining, Greatland Gold and Ariana Resources to name a few.\n\nThough far less developed, there is also a burgeoning bitcoin mining segment at the lower end of the London capital markets.\n\nBitcoin miners use long rows of specialised computers to solve complex equations that help the bitcoin network run, receiving newly minted bitcoins in return. This makes start-up costs high, but margins tend to also be high once operations get up and running.\n\nArgo Blockchain (12.75p), saved by the sale of its Texas-based Helios bitcoin-mining facility to Galaxy Digital, is the most established name (its 78 per cent year-to-date performance underscores perfectly how bitcoin miners reflect the market price of bitcoin).\n\nThere is also Quantum Blockchain (1.58p), the AIM-quoted group with an interest in the arcane world of quantum computing.\n\nChief executive and Italian theoretical physicist Francesco Gardin leads a research and development team trying to develop a new way of mining bitcoin using proprietary algorithms to give miners a competitive edge.\n\nBitcoin miners like Argo Blockchain, whose shares have crashed from their pandemic peak as the graph above shows, are as risky as the cryptocurrency underpinning their operations\n\nThese companies are as risky as the cryptocurrency underpinning their operations, though there will soon be another route to bitcoin exposure.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group has just teamed up with digital asset derivates platform Global Futures and Options (GFO-X) to bring regulated bitcoin futures and options products to UK investors for the first time ever.\n\nParis-based clearing house LCH, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group, will facilitate the transactions via a new, segregated service called DigitalAssetClear.\n\nGFO-X called it 'the first steps to extracting efficiencies from new technologies within a traditional market structure, with the goal over time of delivering 24/7 trading to global regulated digital asset markets'.\n\nDigitalAssetClear will bring bitcoin derivatives products into the regulated market a year after the Financial Conduct Authority prohibited Binance, Coinbase and other trading platforms from offering them.\n\nThe partnership also offers a glimpse of prime minister Rishi Sunak's plans to make the UK a 'global crypto hub'.\n\nAll things considered, the options for UK retail investors seeking alternative exposure to bitcoin prices are objectively limited, albeit growing.\n\nBut if bitcoin prices sustain the rapid momentum we have seen in the latest calendar year, there is a good chance that we'll see more miners, innovators and derivatives platforms coming to the public markets.\n\nLondon could be particularly well-placed to draw IPO interest, if, as is the generally accepted case, bitcoin is treated as a commodity in a similar vein to physical gold rather than a tech-adjacent security.\n\nThe other fundamental question each person must ask themselves is: Should I risk an investment?\n\nThe numerous controversies over the past 12 months, from the dramatic collapses of Three Arrows Capital and FTX to the more recent closures of crypto-focused US banks Signature and Silvergate, have besmirched the reputation of crypto as a respectable asset class, but bitcoin sits apart from the Wild West that is decentralised finance, NFTs and others.\n\nUnlike gold, bitcoin has no intrinsic value and it certainly does not earn a yield in the way a security does, but that has not stopped institutional adoption from ploughing ahead, whether that's commission-free trading offered by Fidelity or BlackRock launching a private bitcoin trust to US clients.\n\nThe message remains as always, do your research , keep your wits sharp and there will be opportunities."

        "content": "As the US banking crisis and regulatory scrutiny continue to unfold, bitcoin shows resilience by posting its third positive month in a row. This recent streak of positive gains for bitcoin signals a strong outlook for the cryptocurrency, the lightning network, and the island of Boracay, as expressed by venture capitalists and government leaders during the first Bitcoin Island Retreat, which happened last March 27 to 29 at the Henann Regency Resort and Spa in Boracay Island.\n\nAugie Ilag, HodlCo venture partner and former Sequoia Capital crypto investor, said that Boracay has the potential to revolutionize the remittance market using the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\n\u201cWith Boracay\u2019s unique position as a popular tourist destination with a significant need for currency conversion, it has the potential to become a bitcoin paradise and a model for other tourist destinations to follow,\u201d Mr. Ilag said.\n\nBoracay has become a beacon for bitcoin adoption and innovation since mid-2022 as bitcoin payments firm Pouch.ph has onboarded more than 250 locations to accept bitcoin as payment. Through the Bitcoin Lightning Network, Pouch.ph makes sending money to the Philippines faster, cheaper, and more accessible for people globally.\n\nMr. Ilag noted that the remittance market in the Philippines is massive, with over $30 billion being sent through traditional offline channels like Western Union, which often charge predatory rates of up to 7%, making it difficult for people to send money back home.\n\n\u201cMany foreigners come to Boracay and have a unique need to convert their home currency into domestic currency but do not have access to local e-money providers like GCash and PayMaya,\u201d Mr. Ilag said. He believes that lightning payments such as Pouch.ph provide a unique solution to the problem of remittances.\n\n\u201cWe are sitting at a unique point in time where we can take advantage of the latest technology to revolutionize the remittance market. Boracay can be at the forefront of this revolution,\u201d Mr. Ilag noted.\n\nPanelists Jack Lee of HCM Capital, Louis Liu of Mimesis Capital, and Mike Jarmuz of Lightning Ventures also hopped onto the stage to show their bullish stance towards bitcoin and the Lightning Network.\n\nFor Mr. Liu, the bitcoin infrastructure has significantly evolved since the 2008 crisis, with new exchanges and applications being built, and has the potential to become a hedge amid current global financial challenges.\n\nMeanwhile, Messrs. Lee and Jarmuz advised attendees to focus on learning about bitcoin and expressed confidence in supporting early-stage founders and entrepreneurs in the Philippines\u2019 bitcoin space.\n\nFormer Solicitor General Florin Hilbay reechoed this bullish sentiment towards bitcoin in a separate panel discussion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very bullish about bitcoin. Every communication system is about speed; it\u2019s about convenience, and it\u2019s about having less friction. I\u2019ve studied monetary systems for two and a half years, and only bitcoin is the real money out there for the 21st century. Bitcoin is not simply a technology, but it is a language that is changing the way we view value,\u201d said Mr. Hilbay, who also briefly discussed his book that provides a universal outline for studying bitcoin.\n\nAs a dean at Siliman University, he aims to make bitcoin a global subject and hopes that the university will become a bitcoin-friendly university and that other universities around the world will follow suit.\n\n\u201cWe need to educate as many people as we can about bitcoin because it\u2019s the best lens for understanding what\u2019s happening in the world today. Then, they get to decide what\u2019s best for them,\u201d Mr. Hilbay said.\n\nThe Bitcoin Island Retreat was organized by Pouch.ph together with crypto exchange and mobile wallet Coins.ph and edutech platform Bitskwela. Bitcoin maxis and plebs who attended the conference experienced living off of bitcoin and realized the power of instant payment through the Lightning Network.\n\nPouch.ph also announced during the conference that it has tied up with ZEBEDEE, a global next-generation payments processor headquartered in New Jersey, USA, for a wider borderless transaction. With this, users around the globe can send and receive funds from any other Lightning wallet or service.\n\nFor instance, a user in the US may want to buy a coffee for a friend in the Philippines. They can now easily transfer funds from Cash App to their friend on the other side of the world, who can then immediately spend those funds to pay in pesos using Pouch.ph.\n\nEarly this year, Pouch.ph partnered with US fintech firm Strike to allow Filipinos in the US to send money to the Philippines using the Lightning Network."
