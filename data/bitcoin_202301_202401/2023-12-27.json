        "title": "Bitcoin's 2023 rally drove some of the stock market's biggest gains this year - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article COIN\n\nMSTR\n\nGBTC\n\nMARA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nMonitors display Coinbase signage during the company's initial public offering at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York on April 14, 2021. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nFor crypto bulls, the most lucrative bets in 2023 were in the stock market. While bitcoin rallied over 150% for the year, shares of Coinbase , MicroStrategy and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust , which are all tied closely to the digital currency, did substantially better, rising more than 300% in value. Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital soared 688%. Not only have those stocks outperformed the primary cryptocurrency, but they've been among the biggest gainers across the whole U.S. market. In the universe of publicly traded U.S. businesses with a market value of at least $5 billion, the four bitcoin-tied stocks were among the eight best performers, according to FactSet. The crypto boom represents a major bounce back from 2022, when coin prices plummeted, taking related equities down with them. A year highlighted by hedge fund collapses, crypto lender failures and crippling losses at miners was punctuated in November 2022, when crypto exchange FTX spiraled into bankruptcy, leading to the arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried on fraud charges. Last month, a jury in New York convicted Bankman-Fried on seven criminal counts, setting the 31-year-old former billionaire up for a possible life behind bars. Weeks later, Changpeng Zhao, founder of crypto exchange Binance, pleaded guilty and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. He faces a possible prison sentence of 18 months or longer. By the time of Bankman-Fried's conviction and Zhao's plea deal, the damage to the broader crypto market had mostly been realized, and investors were looking to the future. One of the biggest drivers for bitcoin this year was an easing of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, which created a more attractive case for riskier assets. Prices were also bolstered by the upcoming bitcoin halving, which takes place every four years and is scheduled for May 2024. In the halving process, the reward for mining is cut in half, capping the supply of bitcoin. Additional buying was sparked by the potential for a flurry of bitcoin exchange-traded funds popping up in the new year. \"It's just more fuel for a fire,\" said Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz, in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" last week. \"Crypto stocks are trading almost like a mania.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin has climbed to $42,683 as of Tuesday, a massive win for investors who got in at the beginning of the year, when the price was around $16,500. But the leading cryptocurrency is still 38% below its record high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021. Among companies closely tied to bitcoin and valued at $5 billion or more, the best-performing stock this year was Marathon, a mining firm that just eclipsed that market cap level last week thanks to a 125% surge in December as of Tuesday's close. On Wednesday, the shares surged another 15%. Last year at this time, Marathon was hanging on by a thread. The company was in the midst of a quarter that ended with a loss of almost $400 million on sales of just $28.4 million because of tumbling bitcoin prices, a power outage at its facility in Montana and Marathon's financial exposure to bankrupt miner Compute North. \"It was pretty dire times,\" Marathon CEO Fred Thiel said in an interview last week. Bitcoin mining is an expensive operation because of the high energy costs required to operate the supercomputers. A drop in bitcoin prices means a sharp reduction in the money producers make selling the coins they mine, even as their energy bills get little relief. Thiel said the company was able to sell equity and was in the fortunate position of not having debt other than a convertible note. The picture has brightened dramatically in 2023. Last month, Marathon reported third-quarter net income of $64.1 million, as revenue jumped from a year earlier to $97.8 million. Now the company is in expansion mode, and last week announced the purchase of its first two fully owned bitcoin mining sites \u2014 one in Texas and one in Nebraska \u2014 for $178.6 million. The acquisitions increased the size of Marathon's mining portfolio by 56% to 910 megawatts of capacity. \"By vertically integrating, we take the profit margin for the third party out and we can run the site the way we want to run it,\" Thiel said. Much of the technology Marathon has been developing, he said, is focused on increased efficiency, \"which in an up market people will ignore\" because high prices lead to high margins. Thiel is trying to make sure the company is on sound financial footing the next time there's a downturn in bitcoin prices. That means bringing down production costs and creating more ways to sell energy back to the grid. He's also optimistic that through energy harvesting \u2014 taking methane gas and converting it to sellable electricity \u2014 Marathon will eventually have much more diverse revenue streams. One of the company's goals by 2028, Thiel said, is to bring bitcoin mining down to 50% of revenue.\n\nBrian Armstrong, co-founder and chief executive officer of Coinbase Inc., speaks during the Singapore Fintech Festival, in Singapore, Nov. 4, 2022. Bryan van der Beek | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\n'Multiple sources of revenue'\n\nOutside of the mining universe, the best-performing crypto stock in the U.S. this year is Coinbase, which has soared 386% as of Tuesday's close. It rose 7.7% on Wednesday. As the only major publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase has long been a popular way to buy and trade cryptocurrencies in its home market. But with the struggles at Binance, the largest exchange in the world, Coinbase picked up market share during non-U.S. trading hours, according to a report from research firm Kaiko in late November. Shortly after Zhao's plea deal, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC that the news amounted to \"a vindication of the long-term strategy that we've taken to focus on compliance, make sure we were building a trusted company.\" Coinbase's revenue and stock price are still way below where they were during the heyday of crypto trading in 2021, when retail investors were jumping into the market to buy all sorts of digital currencies, including gimmicks like Dogecoin. But the business has stabilized following drastic cost-cutting measures starting last year and extending into early 2023. Coinbase also offers investors a bit of diversity outside of bitcoin. In the third quarter, bitcoin accounted for only 37% of transaction revenue at Coinbase, while ethereum made up 18% and other crypto assets amounted to 46%. Additionally, the combination of interest income and stablecoin revenue (earned through USDC reserves) more than doubled in the latest quarter to $212 million due to higher interest rates. Transaction revenue now accounts for less than half of Coinbase's net revenue, down from 96% at the time of the company's public market debut in 2021. \"We made a big effort around the time we went public to start diversifying our revenue,\" Armstrong said in an interview last week with CNBC. \"Now we have multiple sources of revenue, some of them in a high interest rate environment go up, some of them in a low interest environment go up. That means revenue has started to become more predictable.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nThe other top stock performers in crypto are much more closely tied to bitcoin. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is up 330% this year. GBTC hit the over-the-counter market in 2015 as the first publicly traded bitcoin fund in the U.S., offering investors a way to passively own bitcoin. The challenge for investors in the past has been that GBTC is a closed-end fund, which makes it less liquid than an ETF. Late last year, in the darkest days of crypto, GBTC's discount to its net asset value approached 50%, meaning its market cap was about half the value of the bitcoin it owned. As of Dec. 22, that discount had narrowed to 5.6%, the lowest since early 2021. The fund currently owns about $26.6 billion worth of bitcoin and has a market cap of $24.7 billion. In addition to the rally in bitcoin this year, GBTC is getting a boost from the prospects that it will get regulatory clearance next year to convert to an ETF, a move that would allow it to trade through a traditional stock exchange and gain liquidity measures that would bring its market value more in alignment with its NAV. Grayscale said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that Barry Silbert, CEO of parent company Digital Currency Group, is resigning as chairman of Grayscale Investments and exiting the board, effective Jan. 1. No reason for his departure was provided. He's being succeeded as chairman by Mark Shifke, DCG's finance chief.\n\nBig investors join the party\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission met with Grayscale in November and has been formally engaging with other asset managers about the issuance of bitcoin ETFs. Those meetings began after an appeals court sided in August with Grayscale in a lawsuit against the regulator, which had opposed the firm's efforts on concern that investors would lack sufficient protections. Other large money managers, such as BlackRock , Fidelity Investments and Invesco, have taken steps to create their own funds. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" last week that the \"hopeful approval\" for ETFs will bring in new participants, most notably investment advisors who oversee roughly $30 trillion in the U.S. but have restrictions on what they can buy. \"When my team had our court victory, I think that certainly unlocked a lot of optimism amongst investors about GBTC and the prospects for it to uplist as a spot bitcoin ETF,\" Sonnenshein said. \"As we turn the corner into the new year, I know there's a lot of focus on that from the investment community.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nIn the absence of an accessible ETF to date, many investors have flocked to MicroStrategy as a way to buy bitcoin. Founded in 1989 as a business intelligence software company, MicroStrategy now gets the vast majority of its value from the 174,530 bitcoins it owned as of the end of November, currently worth $7.4 billion. The stock's 327% jump this year has lifted the company's market cap to $8.3 billion. Its software and services business generated about $130 million in sales in the third quarter. The company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it purchased an addition 14,620 bitcoins from Nov. 30 to Dec. 26 for $615.7 million, bringing its total to 189,150 bitcoins. The stock jumped 11%. MicroStrategy announced its plan to invest in bitcoin in mid-2020, disclosing in an earnings call that it would commit $250 million over the next 12 months to \"one or more alternative assets,\" which could include digital currencies like bitcoin. At the time, the company's market cap was about $1.1 billion. In the third quarter of 2020, MicroStrategy acquired 38,250 bitcoins for a total of $425 million. Phong Le, who was elevated to CEO from CFO last year, said on the October 2020 earnings call that MicroStrategy's investment in bitcoin allowed it to \"tap into the passion of the broader crypto market,\" adding that, \"We've seen a notable and unexpected benefit from our investment in bitcoin in elevating the profile of the company.\" Since then, MicroStrategy has come to be known as a bitcoin proxy. Co-founder and ex-CEO Michael Saylor is one of the cryptocurrency's principal evangelists, even co-authoring a book on the subject last year called \"What is Money?\" \"The one thing that we can count on is that bitcoin goes forward in the year 2024 and a strategy built around bitcoin is generally a pretty safe one for institutions,\" Saylor said in an interview Dec. 18 on CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" \"Education makes a difference. Institutional adoption makes a difference. The spot ETF news is good news. Loosening of monetary policy is good news.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nSaylor is also optimistic about a mark-to-market accounting rule set to go into effect in 2025 (though companies can choose to adopt it earlier) that changes how companies record crypto assets. Instead of being classified as intangible assets that have to be marked down if the value drops below the purchase price, crypto will be in a separate category and companies will mark it up or down based on where it's trading. Saylor says the new measure provides an incentive for companies with billions of dollars of cash sitting on their balance sheets to put some of that money to work in bitcoin. As good of a year as it's been for the bitcoin bulls, it's been equally painful for the bears. Short sellers, or investors who bet on a drop in stock prices, have lost a combined $6.3 billion on their positions against Coinbase, MicroStrategy and Marathon, according to data supplied by S3 Partners last week. In the first three quarters of the year, crypto shorts spent $2.19 billion buying the stocks to reduce their exposure, the firm said. There's still a hefty dose of skepticism. More than 23% of Marathon's shares available for trading are sold short, while MicroStrategy's short interest-to-float ratio is about 21% and Coinbase's sits at 14%. The average among U.S. stocks is 5%, according to S3.\n\nDimon vs. the evangelists\n\nBut risk remains for the bitcoin believers. While enthusiasts like Saylor are betting on the long-term appreciation of the asset as a hedge against inflation and as a store of value, new investors are jumping into a historically volatile market. When bitcoin fell by more than 60% in 2022, Coinbase, GBTC and MicroStrategy each dropped by at least 74%. Marathon lost 90% of its value and some of its peers went out of business. Even with a more stable environment in 2023, crypto still has high-profile detractors like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who told the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month that, \"The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers \u2026 money laundering, tax avoidance.\" \"If I was the government, I'd close it down,\" he said. But that prospect is looking less likely than ever as more institutional money flows into bitcoin as an investment vehicle. In mid-December, analysts at BTIG lifted their price target on MicroStrategy to $690 from $560, citing improving sentiment and the approaching bitcoin halving. \"Our expectation is that the approval of a spot BTC ETF would increase regulatory clarity around bitcoin, which should give large institutional investors, such as insurance companies, greater comfort investing in bitcoin,\" the analysts wrote. Galaxy Digital's Novogratz says that \"broadly we're still in bull market phase,\" noting that there's a constant and inherent scarcity of bitcoin supply. Novogratz expects bitcoin to eclipse its record high next year, and says that among respected investors, \"I can give you 50 of them on the other side of the table from Jamie Dimon.\" In the near term, Novogratz cautions that with so much momentum coming from crypto traders, the tide could turn and cause a correction. \"I'm a little nervous because it feels so good,\" he said. \u2014 CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this report WATCH: The crypto market is going to 'rally further, research firm says"

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorical trends indicate bitcoin is on pace to blow past record highs and hit $100,000 by 2025, a blockchain executive said.\n\nJoe Kelly, a cofounder and the CEO of Unchained, a cryptocurrency financial-services firm with $2 billion in assets under management, said bitcoin's prior three \"halving\" events \u2014 or when the number of bitcoins rewarded to miners gets cut in half \u2014 suggest massive upside for the token leading up to and after the next halving, in April 2024.\n\nMiners' rewards will be reduced from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 per block, creating a scarcity effect, according to the original whitepaper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nEach of the past three halvings correlated with new highs within 12 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Taking a conservative view,\" Kelly wrote in a note in August, \"if bitcoin stays around $30K until the halving, even a 12-month post-halving increase of 250% \u2014 which, again, is conservative relative to previous halvings \u2014 would price bitcoin at $105K.\"\n\nThe exec pointed out that one year after the 2012, 2016, and 2020 halvings, the price of bitcoin was up 8,069%, 284%, and 559%, respectively.\n\nHe added that the world's biggest crypto by market cap had also experienced sharp rallies leading up to halving events.\n\nIn the 12 months before each of the past three halvings, bitcoin climbed 385%, 142%, and 17%, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFundstrat, meanwhile, published a note to clients in July that said bitcoin could hit $180,000 before the next halving, largely on the back of momentum from a proposed crypto exchange-traded fund from BlackRock.\n\nThe bitcoin-ETF launch \"would bring daily demand to $125 million, while daily supply is only $25 million,\" the Fundstrat strategists wrote, adding: \"The implied equilibrium price would need to rise so daily supply matches daily demand. Equilibrium analysis suggests that a clearing price is $140,000 to $180,000, before the April 2024 halvening.\"\n\nBitcoin's total supply is capped at 21 million, and each halving brings the blockchain closer to that level. Halving happens every 210,000 blocks mined, or about every four years, with the most recent one occurring on May 11, 2020.\n\nBarring surprises, the final halving event should take place in 2140.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has surged more than 120% in 2023, recovering from last year's 65% sell-off. The rebound has coincided with historic interest-rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, as well as a series of bank failures that began with Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nSeparate from the halving event, recent speculation about whether the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin ETF has fueled bullish sentiment.\n\nMeanwhile, any easing of monetary policy in 2024, Kelly said, could provide a further boost for crypto.\n\n\"While past price activity suggests good odds, there is of course no guarantee that the next bitcoin halving will indeed drive\" a record high, Kelly said, adding: \"Mining rewards are not directly tied to market demand and other macroeconomic factors, including a rising interest rate environment, could deter investors from buying bitcoin.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story was originally published in August 2023."

        "content": "Shares of crypto mining operators Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) are popping off on the prospects of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulators approving a spot bitcoin ETF (BTC-USD).\n\nYahoo Finance Reporter Madison Mills joins the Live show to discuss bitcoin miners' plans to expand operations on this pending news and how their stocks have exponentially outperformed bitcoin and other digital asset companies in 2023.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[VIDEO LOGO]\n\nBRAD SMITH: Investors are trying to cash in to the crypto rush ahead of a possible Spot Bitcoin ETF approval next month by buying into Bitcoin mining stocks. So much so that miners are outperforming crypto exchanges and Bitcoin this year. For more on this, we've got Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills here. Maddie, what do we know about this and why this move is taking place right now?\n\nMADISON MILLS: Yeah, guys. I remember a few years ago, Dan Ives explaining to me that during a gold rush, you don't want to buy the gold. You want to buy the picks and shovels. And that's exactly what we're seeing in this Bitcoin miner stock outperformance. These gains are just remarkable here. You've got Marathon Digital Holdings up 800%, Riot Platforms up 400% year-to-date. Both of those obviously outperforming those digital currencies themselves given some of the gains there. Bitcoin itself having 160% increase in 2023.\n\nNow, what's interesting is this is an energy intensive process. It involves a lot of specialized computers. So miners are expanding their operations to boost Bitcoin production. That's of course, in anticipation of that regulatory approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF, which could lead to a lot more demand for that Bitcoin itself.\n\nAnd as you can see here, a lot of firms on the street awaiting that approval. So these firms are anticipating that, and especially Marathon Digital and Riot anticipating that. And they're investing in the technology that would be needed to support that increase in demand so that they're ready when the time comes.\n\nStory continues\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: And this may not be an end of January thing or end of February in terms of the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. I mean, we're getting ready to head out to the World Economic Forum in Davos. And a lot of folks that we're talking to in the lead up think this could happen within two weeks, Brad.\n\nBRAD SMITH: And I think the other thing is what could take place in April of 2024, which is the halving. And one of the huge things that I've been tracking is for all of these miners right now, the halving is going to create even more costs for them because you essentially look at the computing power. If you're looking at a reward that gets cut in half for the operation of mining, then you're essentially doubling the costs for mining.\n\nAnd so for a lot of these operators out there, there could be another inkling of a thought out there within the markets of which one of these miners looks most apt to be acquired by a larger player out there, perhaps a major bank, perhaps one of the firms that's applied for, a Spot ETF, Bitcoin ETF as well because then that would increase the number that they actually have in their own holdings as well here.\n\nSo I think that's one other thought that might be permeating out there or at least rumbling out there in the market as of right now, especially going into that halving that set to take place or expected in April of 2024 marathon, as you were mentioning then, as we were talking about them. They just made an acquisition about $179 million worth of Bitcoin mining operations. So that is one particular thought that struck me this morning that could come forward as well here that's perhaps pushing this play.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: And if there's any positive here besides the obvious, at least this is being driven by a potential catalyst. This is not the broader stock market taking off trading at record highs on hopes for rate cuts, and that's dragging in like the likes of cryptocurrencies. There's some real potential here to unlock a lot of value with these names if that ETF is approved.\n\nMADISON MILLS: That's a great point. It's one of the only names that we've talked about this morning that's not going to be driven by what Jay Powell does, which can be an important thing for investors to think about in their portfolio mix."

        "content": "00:00\n\nWe're as optimistic about Bitcoin as we ever have been. But there were there are a few regulatory and tax uncertainties, and we had been waiting for the discount between BTC and NAV two to narrow. It was as high as 50% at one point last year when there was great uncertainty around all of the turmoil in crypto generally and now it's single digit and there are no other products out there that we can use to gain exposure to Bitcoin in this moment. And it's just a moment of uncertainty between now we think, and January, January 8th to 10th, somewhere in that range perhaps. But we will, out of an abundance of caution, didn't want to take any risk. And I mean, let's get a little bit specific here because we're talking about the ARK next generation Internet ETF. The ticker there is Ark W And I think what caught a lot of people's attention is that you completely sold down your remaining stake of the grayscale Bitcoin trust. Instead, on the same day you bought into the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, of course, that tracks Bitcoin futures. It doesn't actually hold the physical Bitcoin. Can you explain that shuffle? What was the thinking there? Sure. A couple of things. First of all, Bitto the ProShares is already approved. There's no regulatory uncertainty having to do with it. So we chose to maintain our exposure through BITTO for the time being. And as I mentioned before, there are some tax and regulatory uncertainties still as part of this process. We don't know exactly who's going to be approved and and whether they've met all the criteria that the SEC has put before us. We know we have, but we don't know if others, including Gbtc, have. We just we just don't know. So so again, out of an abundance of caution and Djibouti's discount again, it was as much as 50% relative to NAV. So not only have we enjoyed this year the run in bitcoin itself, but we've had the nice closing of that discount. So it's been, you know, double good news for us. Well, you've talked about January ten, Cathie. I think in another report. Is that possible, whether it's you or somebody else in terms of the first spot, Bitcoin ETF actually getting approval? Well, we think the probabilities have gone up because the SEC has been highly engaged compared to what was happening before. Before it was just denying approval, denying approval. And we just kept putting our filing in again, you know, try, try, try, you know, how good and determined. And so here we are. We think we're we're first in line. And that's why there is this January 10th deadline. But we like the idea that the SEC has been so engaged. And it's not just with us, it's others as well. We think a number of a number of funds could be approved at the same time. And they've been asking not only one set of questions, but follow up questions. And again, that's a very good sign. Well, speaking of engaged. Oh, go ahead, please. No, no, no. The last few questions have been very technical and and so more de rigueur. And, you know, you'd expect them to be asking these questions as we head toward an approval. No, it's not 100% certain. And so we want to make that clear as well. This is the SEC, and we never know, you know, what might happen along the way. Regulators can be tricky, that's for sure. Hey, listen, you mentioned engagement. Let's talk about engagement with your funds overall, and especially the Ark Innovation Fund, up 72% year to date, easily outperforming some of the major market benchmarks, still down 65% from the high back in February of 2021. For you, though, a lot of critics, we bring up your name, we bring up Ark, and you have a lot of fans and you have a lot of critics. Is a lot of discussion. Does it feel, though, a little bit like a victory lap this year? Well, you know, we are very happy that a couple of things have happened, that this idea that interest rates, we're going to continue moving higher has been proven incorrect. And I think even the Fed, while there is that small possibility, even the Fed is now starting to talk about the other side of the interest rate move. And so I do believe all we've seen so far is a reaction to that macro phenomenon or judgment call. We went through our flagship strategy and all of our strategies. Went through a very difficult time from February 21 through December of 22, as interest rates, first of all, were presumed to move up or forecasted to move up. And then when they did move up, so it was almost like a double discounting. And so we've seen the first installment of the the the correction there to the upside for our funds with this notion. And it's again, the forecast that interest rates will come down. And we would presume that if they do come down for the reasons we think they're going to come down, the most important one being deflation, then our funds will be in good shape because we are very our companies thrive on deflation. Technologically enabled innovation is deflationary. So, Cathie, a very good morning to you. It's madness. First time we've met on. So we're going to move to a deflationary environment. We'll come back to the big macro call in a moment. Just let let's squared away before I talk to you about the flows in the funds, which is how much interest rate cuts do you presume are you forecasting leave the forecast of everybody else aside? What what do you what do you presume will happen next year? Well, we put up a chart in one of our in the in the nose, which is a YouTube video that I do every every month. Employment Friday. And in that chart you will find a ratio it's the metals to gold ratio. So metals price to gold price. And there has been an extremely tight correlation between that ratio and long term interest rates. In October we we published it or early November. And what you will see is that there was a very wide gap that had developed the metals to gold ratio was near its low for the past 1215 years and interest rates were at their highs 5%. The correlation, if you just eyeballed that chart, the correlations suggested that rate should go to 2%. Now maybe they will go all the way to 2%. But we think that long term interest rates are way above where they're going to and because of deflation. Okay. Well, let's we'll come back to that and see whether we get to the 2% level. I've got to ask you about the flows into the funds, which is obviously, you know, is kind of just edgy. You've got a bit of a victory lap going on at the moment, but this is the first year of outflows. Have those outflows stopped? You've had a great performance in the back part of this year. Have the outflows stopped and has that bleed stopped? Yes. Well, we were very gratified at our asset retention in 21 and 22. In fact, we had net inflows. If you combine both years of more than 8 billion and this year one might expect that those who average down into the very steep declines that we were seeing in 22 especially might take some profit. So we have had I know for our flagship strategy, it's roughly $500 million in outflows, maybe for all of our strategies, 1.8 million. So maybe 10% of the inflows that we enjoyed during 21 and 22. So again, we're very gratified and grateful to our our clients for the support that we continue to receive. So has has the outflows stopped? We have had days of on balance very recently. Yes. And I think part of this is many people do tax management towards the end of the year. And so some of the outflows might have been associated with with clients who got in at a high cost base and we're just harvesting some tax losses, but I think we're through that. Do you find it a little surprising, though, Cathie, considering the run up or do you I'm curious about the conversations you do have with investors considering the year that you're having and then to see those flows, It's got to be a little disheartening. Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no, not at all. Actually, we put out a piece for Resolute, our distributor, who and we basically showed them if you rebalance our strategy when there have been big moves one way or the other, if you rebalance regularly or based on a rule like when when the fund's up 15% relative to everything else, take some profits. And what it showed that studies showed that if you are disciplined that way, that over any rolling five year period, it is highly. Likely almost 100%. I'm not quite sure if it's quite that high, but that that it will beat the market. Meaning, as measured by the Nasdaq or the S & P over a rolling five year period. And so a lot of our funds are with advisors who are very sophisticated and responded somewhat, perhaps in this tech tax management part of the year to that message. I feel like we can't talk. We have to talk about Tesla and Elon Musk. I know you just had a conversation on Twitter X. This has been, I think from day one, right. In terms of you starting out that you've had this investment in Tesla. And I remember when we first talked and you were getting started, you talked about him being the next Thomas Edison and how his vehicles would turn the US economy upside down. Having said that, there's an evolution and the world has changed. How are you thinking? It's still a top holding? How are you thinking about the Tesla story right now? Well, first of all, Carol, thank you very much for letting me interview that time. That was nearly ten years ago. And Target is about to celebrate its 10th year anniversary. And you gave us that opportunity. So thank you. The world is evolving, actually, I think, even more closely to what we expected because we expected a lot of traditional auto manufacturers to see the writing on the wall and rush as quickly as they could into scaling big time into electric vehicles. And what has happened recently, both GM and Ford have said we're stepping back. We're not going to do this until it's profitable. The problem with that is in order to be profitable, they need to scale. That's how this works. These are learning curves that they are writing down and those are expressed in cost declines. So the fact that they're pulling back means they're more there's more share for Tesla and others who choose to go for it. And Kathy, I want to keep the conversation going on, Elon Musk, but I want to bring it to the Ark Venture Fund. Of course, it's not an ETF. You invest in private companies, etc., in there. And you take a look at the portfolio, you have Space X in there and you also have X formerly known as Twitter. And in July you had told the Wall Street Journal that you had written down your Twitter stake by 47%. Fill us in on the past couple of months. Have you written it down further or how is that changed? No, I think it's still there. You know, we have to be very careful. This is an interim fund. It is a 40 act fund, and we have to mark to market every day. The good news is our clients can get in and have access to these amazing companies for just $500 and they get quarterly liquidity. So so that's the good news. The markdowns are simply, you know, if we see in the secondary market employee stock trading at a steep discount, we have to take that into account. If we see others in the more traditional asset management world like Fidelity and others marking their holdings down, we need to take that into consideration during our daily mark to market. So it's an abundance of caution. We have a five year investment time horizon. Do we think that's where X belongs in terms of valuations? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. A roughly $20 billion valuation for what we believe truly will become the everything app. Think WeChat pay. Elon started his entrepreneurial career in the payments industry and he's been thinking about this for a long time. He now has money transmitter licenses in more than half of all of the states, which we learned on Twitter spaces or on X spaces, I should say the other day when we had our interview with him. So that's exciting. He's going for it. He's going for it. We'll see if that one lands. But let's talk a little bit more about the private markets, because obviously the private credit market has gotten a lot of attention right now. You're looking at the private markets through this interval fund that you have. When you think about the opportunities there on that five year horizon that you have, do you see more so in the public markets or in the private markets right now? Well, now that we've had this very nice run this year, we think the answer to that question is in the private markets, they're close. They're close. What's fascinating to us is that the public markets have been leading the private markets for the past three years as our funds were were falling in 21. Private evaluations were going through all time highs, along with the Nasdaq. They were taking their cues, I suppose, from the Nasdaq, but. Real innovation, if you looked at our portfolios, was starting to revalued to the downside and even more so in 2022. We are still seeing major down rounds taking place in the private markets. And I'm always surprised at this sort of thing because you would think that the private markets lead the public markets. That has not been the case in the last few years. Hey, Cathie, I got to be honest with you. I think whenever we think about Elon Musk, brilliant but also erratic, and I'm curious how you think about Elon, the individuals versus Elon, the companies he's creating, the things he's doing, because I think that there is time. Any other CEO of a major publicly held company would, I think it's safe to say, not be able to get away with a lot of what he has done. So help us educate us how you make sense of it if someone you have followed talked with for many years. Well, first of all, very often we just look at what he does, not exactly what he's saying, which can often be a distraction or it can be an advertisement for his cars or for X or or for space X and so forth. So. But we have a scoring system as we are evaluating companies and their founders and their management teams and their six metrics. And one of them is moat and barriers to entry. And I think Elon is a maestro of raising barriers to entry with innovation, which that is so much faster than anyone else. Why? Because he's so first principles physics driven in his analysis of how to approach a new idea, a big idea. So tell me this then, Cathie. I mean, if you look at the cohort of years of CEOs that you backed, Brian Armstrong, does he hit that bar? Does he is he above Elon or is he at the money? You've got Elon, you've got Brian, you've got Tony Wood at Rocco. Does anybody come close to Elon or is Brian Armstrong maybe even at the money with Elan or above? Well, we don't actually look at the world that way, one relative to the other. In terms of management teams, we do look from our scoring system at the scores, which include most management people and culture execution, a valuation that might surprise people and product and service leadership and thesis risk closer to six scores and both but but well, all three of them score very highly which one scores the highest? They are actually very close to one another, to be honest. They're very close to one another. So I mean, obviously Coinbase is one of your key holdings. We've talked a little bit about that. The other the other feature that we want to talk about is a I, I'm curious to know an open air, the valuations have ranged between 80 billion to 100 billion. Will you take a position in open air? Is that going to be part of your holdings as you explore the next development of AI in your holdings? Well, in our private portfolios, we are already exposed to anthrax traffic, which has been a major beneficiary of the drama around open air that we all witnessed a few months ago. But if you look at GPT four, which is the latest large language model that that open air has published, it is way above others in terms of performance. So there you have it, the pros and the cons. So we can't tell you what we're going to do in that portfolio. But we are so impressed at how open air has led the industry. We're also impressed, however, at the open source models and and we'd like to encourage more of that movement. We know that Metal platforms has helped with Lomita and it's working on others. It is moving very quickly and making great strides. So for much lower cost, open source is free. Companies can get close not not, not at GP 84, but close. So we want to see the open source movement in in the venture fund. We also own Cathie. We've got to it. Oh, sorry. No, no, no. We never have enough time with you. Can I ask you a really quick question? 5 seconds. Any new ETFs coming our way from you guys next year? Well, real quickly, as you may know, we bought a company in London. Yeah, they have some very interesting funds."

        "content": "It also shows bitcoin's max pain point (MPP), or the level at which options buyers stand to lose the most on expiry. The theory is that options sellers, typically institutions with ample capital supply, look to push the underlying asset's spot price toward that level to make their counterparties, the buyers, suffer the most. In late 2020 and most of 2021, bitcoin saw volatility in the direction of the max pain point in the lead-up to the expiry, only to resuming the uptrend following the settlement."

The central bank has also hinted at multiple rate cuts in 2024, which could be as many as three.\n\nHigher interest rates negatively impact growth-oriented sectors, which include technology, consumer discretionary industries and cryptocurrencies.\n\nBesides, investors are confident about an imminent approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The approval is expected to wield a substantial impact, bolstering the cryptocurrency market.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc.

        "content": "As 2024 approaches, investors should take a step back and assess their portfolio allocations. Ask yourself which of your positions may be primed for profit-taking and which may be worth doubling down on.\n\nAmong the variables that could move the markets in 2024 are possible interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, whether the U.S. is headed toward recession, and the volatility that tends to occur during election years. During otherwise cloudy macroeconomic conditions, investors may want to consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to alternative assets.\n\nTypically, alternative investments can include commodities such as gold, physical assets like real estate, or even artwork. However, during the past several years a new asset class has garnered both attention and significant capital investment: cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough crypto is still fairly new as an asset class, opening a small position in Bitcoin (BTC -6.13%) may prove to be a savvy move for long-term investors. Trading at a price of roughly $42,000 per token, Bitcoin may not appear cheap. However, several catalysts could help push it much higher in 2024.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nAt its core, Bitcoin is digital currency -- a form of payment that is not governed or regulated by traditional banks. Although Bitcoin is little used as a medium of exchange, there is a case for it as a store of value. For this reason, some people refer to Bitcoin as digital gold.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin is quite different from purchasing stock in a company. The cryptocurrency does not have earnings, a management team, or any real securities guidelines that it must obey. Similar to other alternative assets, the value of Bitcoin largely stems from perception driven by supply and demand. For this reason, Bitcoin's price fluctuates frequently.\n\nNonetheless, the price of Bitcoin has seen some new life over the past year, surging nearly 160%. And with 2024 carrying a lot of question marks, the cryptocurrency could be poised for further market-beating returns.\n\nIs Bitcoin recession-proof?\n\nFor the past several quarters, economists have been sounding the alarm for a recession in 2024. However, economic indicators such as job growth, unemployment, and inflation continue to suggest that a recession may not materialize next year.\n\nThe chart below shows the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate for the U.S. during the past decade. Investors can see that in the latest quarter the annualized growth rate of 4.9% was well above the long-term average, and represents a slight uptick from the prior quarter. So while the economy may not fall into a recession, there are still many reasons to consider Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nWhere is Bitcoin headed in 2024?\n\nOne of the most obvious investment themes for 2024 is the fact that it is an election year. Although it is too early to know which candidates will land on the ballot and who will head to (or stay in) Washington in 2025, the likelihood of a volatile stock market next year could be pretty high. As candidates lobby for various legislative moves during campaign events and debates, it is natural for certain market sectors to experience more pronounced trading activity. For this reason, unless you have built a well-diversified portfolio, chances are you could experience some significant volatility next year, which leads to my second point.\n\nSome industries have handily outperformed the broader market this year. For example, technology stocks ripped in 2023, fueled by bullish outlooks on artificial intelligence (AI). Even if you did not directly own any of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, tech-heavy index funds like Invesco QQQ were up by more than 50% year to date -- more than double the S&P 500's gains.\n\nAlthough the secular demand trends of AI could very well pour over into 2024, it's highly likely that some tech stocks are overbought right now. Investors should consider trimming certain positions and allocating some capital to asset classes that might see some renewed interest in 2024. Cryptocurrency fits this description and represents an opportunity for investors who can accept some level of speculation.\n\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst for Bitcoin heading into 2024 is the possibility that one or more spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will launch next year. Approval of a spot ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would represent an important validation of cryptocurrencies and could spark a bull run.\n\nThe last thing that could send the token's price surging next year is the looming Bitcoin halving. Following past Bitcoin halvings, in which the reward miners receive for adding to the blockchain is cut in half, the cryptocurrency has witnessed renewed buying activity and eclipsed past highs.\n\nThe combination of election-driven volatility, coupled with potential momentum from regulators and the possibility of a Bitcoin halving cycle make me bullish on the token's prospects for next year. Despite its surge in 2023, I would not be surprised if Bitcoin eclipses its record high of about $69,000 next year and moves toward six-figure territory. For these reasons, investors might want to consider a small position in Bitcoin now."

        "content": "News Direct NYC --News Direct-- Everlodge\n\nThe future for crypto still looks bright. Allied Market Research released a report that the cryptocurrency market value is about to triple by 2030, hitting a whopping $4.94 billion. What's fueling this crypto rocket? According to Allied, it's the focus of cryptocurrency on remittances and global payments taking the lead \u2013 put in one word, utility.\n\nFrom all indications, cryptocurrency is gearing up to be a big player in the future of global finance; but that's 7 years away from now according to the AMR. However, in the near term, investors are eager to know what lies ahead in 2024.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the recently emerged presale utility-focused gem, Everlodge, have all demonstrated the potential for substantial returns. While the reasons behind their promising prospects are quite evident, let\u2019s take a quick dive to see why these projects rank among the best crypto investments to consider ahead of 2024.\n\nGrayscale CEO Optimistic on Bitcoin While Crypto Wizard Target Remains $55,000 for Bitcoin in Q1 2024\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein is seeing big potential for Bitcoin (BTC) once the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gives the thumbs up to a spot market BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIn a recent CNBC interview, Sonnenshein, though not one to throw around price predictions, emphasizes the prevailing optimism in the market. According to him, a substantial number of investors are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon and integrating it into their portfolios. As we anticipate the potential approval of the ETF, he believes it will be a game-changer, unlocking opportunities for a significant portion of the investment community.\n\nAs per price predictions, analyst Crypto Wizard posted on X, talking about a potential dip in Bitcoin price below the $40k threshold in the weeks ahead. They note that in the event of any deviation from this prediction, a decisive break above $46k for Bitcoin would be the game-changer. Despite these short-term fluctuations, their overall target stands firm at $55k for Bitcoin price by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum Looks Bullish for 2024\n\nThe immense popularity of the Ethereum (ETH) network has positioned it among the leading altcoins in today's market. Its widespread appeal is not the only factor contributing to its positive sentiment; Ethereum also benefits from a history of resilience and market dominance.\n\nWith a current price of $2,230, Ethereum has experienced significant growth in the past month, reaching a peak of around $2,367 to mark the highest point of the year. While the overall bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market may be waning, Ethereum price has managed to remain relatively stable, with a nearly 2% increase over the past week.\n\nHowever, considering the recent drop of over $100 from its peak, investors should be prepared for a potential further correction. Yet, given Ethereum's historical price resilience and strong market presence, it is reasonable to expect a more stable price trajectory leading up to the new year.\n\nEverlodge Has Lofty Plans To Take Charge in Q1 2024\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) emerged as a revolutionary force in the real estate realm, positioned to revolutionize the $280 trillion industry by tackling long-standing challenges. Traditionally, the prohibitively high entry costs, often reaching millions of dollars, combined with a lack of transparency and liquidity, have created barriers for numerous potential investors.\n\nEverlodge's DeFi property marketplace directly confronts these challenges within the travel property sector. Through the innovative approach of listing properties as NFTs on its platform, Everlodge introduces fractionalized ownership, allowing investors to purchase NFT fractions representing a percentage of a property. Imagine owning 25% of a property generating $6,000 monthly, resulting in a $1,500 passive income.\n\nIn essence, Everlodge not only breaks down barriers but also provides investors with the opportunity to access equity in some of the world's most luxurious travel properties and you can join in for only $0.027.\n\nFurthermore, industry experts predict a potential 10X surge in Everlodge's project valuation if the company successfully achieves crucial milestones. This projection highlights the anticipation surrounding Everlodge's transformative initiatives and underscores the potential for significant growth, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments leading up to 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, the probability of a positive upturn in cryptocurrency in 2024 is very much palpable and projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Everlodge have everything to fight for to become the best coins to invest in 2024.\n\nFor more information about the ongoing Everlodge (ELDG) Presale, please visit their website.\n\nEverlodge provides you with a seamless approach to fractional investing in vacation rentals, eliminating the complexities associated with traditional real estate investment.

        "title": "Bitcoin bulls and bears prepare for end-of-year $10B BTC options expiry - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) market is preparing for a $10.1 billion options expiry, a significant event set to occur on Dec. 29 at 8:00 am ET. The latest data indicates that call (buy) options hold a clear advantage, but bears could significantly limit their losses by pushing Bitcoin's price below $42,000.\n\nBoth sides have incentives to influence Bitcoin's spot price, but as the deadline approaches, one can gauge the outcome based on the expiry price. The options market leader, Deribit, boasts an impressive $7.7 billion open interest, but the surprise comes from the runner-up, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), with $1.38 billion. The CME\u2019s open interest is more than double that of OKX, which is in third place with $630 million.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF expectations gave bullish options an edge\n\nThe impending approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January has a substantial impact on the December options expiry. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has notably changed its approach in how it engages with ETF proponents. Instead of outright rejections, the SEC has been actively engaging in dialogue with ETF creators. This shift in approach is a positive signal and raises expectations of potential ETF approval in January. This alone explains why bears are unlikely to succeed in suppressing Bitcoin's price below $40,000 ahead of the year-end BTC options expiry.\n\nIn another significant development, Binance's recent plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice and regulators signifies the evolving cryptocurrency landscape toward compliance and Anti-Money Laundering practices. This development indicates the increasing integration into the mainstream financial ecosystem, which also bolsters the odds of spot ETF approval, especially after changes on the Grayscale Investments\u2019 board and the subsequent refiling of its request to convert the Grayscale GBTC Trust.\n\nThe aggregate open interest for the December options expiry stands at $10.1 billion. However, it's projected that the final amount will be much less, as the recent rally above $40,000 caught bearish investors off guard, as evident from the Deribit Bitcoin options interest chart.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin Options Open Interest for Dec. 29. Source: Deribit\n\nThe combined open interest of Deribit and CME options is $9 billion, although put (sell) options are underrepresented by 32%, reflecting the imbalance compared to the $5.4 billion in call (buy) open interest. Still, with Bitcoin gaining 25% since November, the majority of put (sell) options are likely to expire worthless.\n\nIf Bitcoin's price remains near $43,100 at 8:00 am UTC on Dec. 29, only $185 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference occurs because the right to sell Bitcoin at $40,000 or $43,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nBitcoin bears will want BTC price under$42,000 to minimize losses\n\nHere are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The imbalance favoring each side determines the theoretical profit. This crude estimate disregards more complex investment strategies, as there's no straightforward way to estimate this effect.\n\nBetween $39,000 and $40,000: 3,000 calls vs. 17,700 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $575 million.\n\n3,000 calls vs. 17,700 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $575 million. Between $40,000 and $42,000: 13,800 calls vs. 11,600 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $90 million.\n\n13,800 calls vs. 11,600 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $90 million. Between $42,000 and $44,000: 24,200 calls vs. 7,200 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $730 million.\n\n24,200 calls vs. 7,200 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $730 million. Between $44,000 and $45,000: 27,900 calls vs. 1,800 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $1.15 billion.\n\nFor the bears to level the playing field before the monthly expiry, they must achieve a modest 3% price decrease down to $41,900. In contrast, the bulls require a pump above $44,000 to secure a $1.15 billion advantage on Dec. 29. Still, the potential windfall for call option holders could become a catalyst for further price gains ahead of the ETF decision in January.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Potential approval of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States will trigger fundamental problems related to the original vision of Bitcoin by the anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, according to one analyst.\n\nThe concept of a spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 an investment product that tracks the price of BTC by holding Bitcoin \u2014 conflicts with the idea of self-custody, according to Josef T\u011btek, a Bitcoin analyst at the hardware crypto wallet firm Trezor.\n\nUnlike a Bitcoin ETF, self-custodial crypto storage solutions allow users to own Bitcoin by taking full responsibility for holding the private key \u2014 or the actual assets.\n\n\u201cIn principle, spot Bitcoin ETFs take people further from self-custody and potentially introduce a systemic risk, as ETFs will be safer on the surface than exchanges,\u201d T\u011btek said in an interview with Cointelegraph.\n\nOne possible consequence of spot Bitcoin ETF approval could be that large quantities of BTC would be stored in central locations where the government could seize them, the analyst said, referring to a scenario seen with the confiscation of gold in the United States in the 1930s. T\u011btek added:\n\n\u201cAnd while a spot Bitcoin ETF would make exposure to Bitcoin price movements more accessible to individuals and institutions alike, simply buying Bitcoin through conventional means would offer the same exposure. Do we really need ETFs for this?\u201d\n\nAnother significant issue with a spot Bitcoin ETF is that ETF holders will not have the option to withdraw the underlying asset. Instead, these assets are held in aggregate by the ETF itself, which raises the possibility of the unchecked issuance of \u201cpaper Bitcoin,\u201d not supported by actual Bitcoin, the supply of which is capped at 21 million coins, T\u011btek noted. The analyst stated:\n\n\u201cThe result could be the creation of millions of unbacked Bitcoin, which would distort genuine markets and depress the value of real Bitcoin \u2014 all while handing greater agency to the giants of centralized, traditional finance. The very antithesis of Satoshi\u2019s original vision.\u201d\n\nT\u011btek\u2019s remarks on self-custody versus spot Bitcoin ETFs flag a potential downside amid the growing optimism on the market, with various firms and analysts expecting U.S. securities regulators to approve a spot BTC ETF in January 2024.\n\nRelated: ARK\u2019s Cathie Wood sees short-term effect of spot Bitcoin ETF as \u2018sell on news\u2019\n\nNot everyone has been optimistic about spot BTC ETFs, though. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, believes that spot BTC ETFs could \u201ccompletely destroy\u201d Bitcoin if they are too successful. If not Bitcoin, such ETFs will likely compete with centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase, as ETF fees are expected to be lower than those on exchanges, according to some Bloomberg analysts.\n\nAccording to Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan, there is no direct conflict between self-custody and spot Bitcoin ETFs because retail users will stick to self-custody.\n\n\u201cPersonally speaking, I would never buy any sort of paper IOU forms of Bitcoin, but that\u2019s because I have the option of self-custody,\u201d Greenspan told Cointelegraph. \u201cMost institutions don\u2019t have that option,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere are zero advantages and plenty of disadvantages for retail investors to hold Bitcoin ETFs. Way better to just hold Bitcoin,\u201d Greenspan stated.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "On Wednesday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest made a significant move in the cryptocurrency space, purchasing over $92 million worth of ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE:BITO). This trade comes amidst a dynamic period in the crypto market, aligning with Ark Invest\u2019s strategic adjustments in response to evolving market conditions.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF Trade\n\nArk purchased 4,320,928 units of BITO through ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) on Wednesday. For the day, BITCO closed 3.2% higher at $21.31. The transaction was valued at $92.08 million.\n\nArk Invest\u2019s acquisition of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF represents a substantial investment in the cryptocurrency sector. This move follows Wood\u2019s recent comments on the potential impact of Bitcoin ETF approvals on the market. The investment aligns with her belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and its related financial products.\n\nArk\u2019s decision to invest heavily in BITO, highlights the firm\u2019s confidence in the future of cryptocurrency, despite the recent divestment from other crypto-related assets like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC).\n\nSee Also: Cathie Wood Outlines Role Of Bitcoin Post-ETF Approval, Praises 21Shares: \u2018The Plumbing Works\u2019\n\nThe Coinbase Global Inc.

Trade\n\nAnother notable trade by Ark Invest was the sale of 101,921 shares of Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) through ARKW. The transaction held a value of $1.8 million, calculated at the Wednesday closing price of $17.47 for the company co-founded by Peter Thiel. Previously, Ark doubled down on Palantir amid market corrections. Even so, Palantir shares have gained 172.12% since 2023 began.\n\nThe Block Inc. Trade\n\nArk Invest also adjusted its position in Block Inc (NYSE:SQ), selling 231,102 shares through ARKW. The transaction was valued at $18.4 million. On Wednesday, Block shares closed 1.82% higher at $79.60. Cathie Wood has in the past publicly defended Block against a short report by Hindenburg Research.

For stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds investors are bound to what is known as the wash-sale rule. This means that if you sell one of these securities at a loss you must wait 30 days before you can repurchase it. This rule does not apply to cryptocurrencies yet. If you have a digital asset with an unrealized loss, it is an option to sell and rebuy immediately. Having that capital loss to carry forward (called tax loss harvesting) can be extremely beneficial even if you can\u2019t offset it against a gain this year. Note that with exchange fees, slippage, and general market volatility you won\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll have the same number of units when you re-buy. Until this rule is applied to cryptocurrency it is a benefit that only direct holders will have.

The proposal listed prices for roughly 500 assets in fiat and cryptocurrency, based on those at the time of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing.\n\nAccording to the proposed prices, Bitcoin (BTC) claimants could receive $16,871 per coin, Ether (ETH) was priced at $1,258, and Binance Coin (BNB) at $286. The table excluded an estimated FTX Token (FTT) price but included prices for leveraged tokens, tokenized stocks, spot derivatives, and crypto futures.\n\n\u201c[T]his Court has broad discretion to choose whatever method it deems best-suited to the particular circumstances to estimate the valuation of Claims based on Digital Assets,\u201d said the filing. \u201c[C]ourts consider all factors and circumstances surrounding the claims, but do not seek to estimate claims with mathematical precision.\u201d\n\nThe debtors added:\n\n\u201c[T]he Plan provides for Claims in respect of Digital Assets to be calculated by converting the value of the Digital Asset into Cash as of the Petition Date using the rates set forth in the Digital Assets Conversion Table, and making Distributions in Cash.\u201d\n\nAccording to the filing, the debtors used data from Coin Metrics to estimate the digital asset prices. Parties with the bankruptcy case have until Jan. 11 to file objections, with a hearing on the matter scheduled for Jan. 25. The motion granting an order to estimate creditor claims based on the proposed pricing is pending approval by the court.\n\nRelated: FTX debtors propose separate deal with Sam Bankman-Fried over Embed acquisition\n\nMany X \u2014 formerly Twitter \u2014 users who claimed to be FTX users objected to the proposed plan.

        "content": "By Dietrich Knauth\n\nNEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge has approved cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network's pivot to bitcoin mining, ruling that the company could deviate from a previously approved bankruptcy plan because creditors and customers were no worse off under the new restructuring.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan on Wednesday said the bankruptcy plan approved in November contained enough flexibility to allow Celsius to switch to a backup plan after it hit a road block with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nCelsius filed for Chapter 11 protection in July 2022, one of several crypto lenders to go bankrupt following the rapid growth of the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCelsius had scaled back broader ambitions to earn fees from validating crypto transactions and start new lines of business after the SEC rejected that plan.\n\nThe switch also meant that Celsius would part ways with some of the outside bidders that were selected to manage the new company, leaving mining company US Bitcoin Corp squarely in charge of running the new, creditor-owned mining business.\n\nUS Bitcoin Corp, founded by Hut 8's Asher Genoot, was originally going to manage Celsius alongside other companies in a consortium of bidders which included Arrington Capital and was collectively called \"Fahrenheit.\"\n\nSome creditors, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog, argued that the change was significant enough that Celsius should have to put the proposal up for a new vote by creditors.\n\nGlenn was initially sympathetic to that argument, saying during a Nov. 30 court hearing that the mining plan was \" that the creditors voted on.\" But Glenn ultimately approved the deal without requiring a new vote.\n\n\"This is a significant day for Celsius creditors and our focus on promptly distributing cryptocurrency continues to guide us,\" Celsius' interim CEO, Chris Ferraro, said on Thursday.\n\nCelsius expects to emerge from bankrutpcy in early 2024.\n\nCelsius' scaled-back bankruptcy plan also frees up $225 million in cryptocurrency assets that would have been used to fund the new business lines that were rejected by the SEC.\n\nAs a result, more cryptocurrency from Celsius will be returned to customers, Glenn wrote, and customers will also receive equity shares in the new bitcoin mining business.\n\n(Reporting by Dietrich Knauth in New York Editing by Daniel Wiessner and Matthew Lewis)\n\n((Dietrich.Knauth@thomsonreuters.com;))\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Crypto asset manager Grayscale lodged an amended S-3 filing with the United States securities regulator on the same day Barry Silbert \u2014 the CEO of its parent company Digital Currency Group \u2014 announced his resignation from Grayscale\u2019s board of directors.\n\nSome crypto market commentators speculate that Silbert\u2019s departure could significantly increase the odds that Grayscale will successfully convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF, currently awaiting a decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nBarry's resignation was @Sonnenshein's X-Mas gift.\n\n\n\nWhat to make of @bsilbert resigning from Grayscale?\n\n\n\nGrayscale has had 9 meetings with the SEC per the table below (h/t @JSeyff)\n\n\n\nToday, there are only allegations against DCG which have not been resolved in a court of law.\u2026 https://t.co/d7tZFFAOoU pic.twitter.com/NjjdWq0F3a \u2014 Ram Ahluwalia CFA, Lumida (@ramahluwalia) December 26, 2023\n\nLumida Wealth CEO Ramah Luwalia speculates that Silbert\u2019s resignation was likely of his own accord to improve the odds of the ETF approval \u2014 due in large part to the SEC\u2019s ongoing investigation into Silbert and DCG.\n\nAdam Cochran, a partner at crypto venture capital firm Cinneamhain Ventures, speculates Silbert\u2019s decision to step down was \u201cfor sure an agreement\u201d made between Grayscale and the SEC ahead of the conversion request being approved.\n\nAnd there it is, this step down is for sure an agreement for Barry to be out for Grayscale to join the ETF ranks.\n\n\n\nGlad I loaded up on GBTC and ETHE with the higher discount today. https://t.co/89G2QVOAEJ \u2014 Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) December 26, 2023\n\nSilbert\u2019s departure was noted in an 8-K filing to the SEC filed on Dec. 26, with the firm announcing that DCG\u2019s chief financial officer, Mark Shifke would succeed Silbert as chairman of the board at Grayscale.\n\nOutside of Silbert stepping down, the most notable element of the amended S-3 filing was that Grayscale had \u201cfinally surrendered\u201d to a cash creation model, according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nGrayscale finally surrendering to cash-only creations, was a big holdout. Pretty sure they have an AP agreement (a crucial last step) so that would check all the boxes. That said, still a mystery whether they will be allowed to go on day one of the Cointucky Derby https://t.co/Wm7TfD3zkP \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 26, 2023\n\nCash vs. in-kind creations have been an ongoing point of conflict between asset managers looking to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF and the SEC.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows could dwarf all 163 crypto ETPs today\n\nWhile most stock and commodity-based ETFs run on an in-kind model \u2014 which allows fund market participants to directly handle the asset in the fund \u2014 a cash-creation model means that new shares in a spot Bitcoin ETF could only be created or redeemed through cash transactions.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s move to prevent broker-dealers from dealing directly with Bitcoin has been viewed as an attempt to better track the Bitcoin moving from exchanges and mitigating any potential risks associated with anti-money laundering or Know Your Customer compliance.\n\nScott Johnsson, general partner at VB Capital, noted that while the SEC purports to stand for investor protection, the cash creation model could pose a greater risk to investors looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a spot ETF.\n\nGrayscale's amended S-3 gives a nice little background on the key sticking point for in-kind creation/redemption. The SEC promulgated rulemaking for digital asset safekeeping. Despite the fact that BDs and exchanges apparently believe they could comply with the rule and offer\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SdudYdsgoR \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) December 27, 2023\n\n\u201cDespite all other spot commodity ETFs operating with in-kind models, this must be done in a novel way via cash and who knows if that will work,\u201d wrote Johnsson.\n\nMagazine: DeFi\u2019s billion-dollar secret: The insiders responsible for hacks"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is showing classic signs that fresh BTC price gains are near, one longtime market participant says.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Dec. 27, trader and popular social media commentator Matthew Hyland predicted \u201cimminent\u201d bullish moves.\n\nTrader on BTC price: \u201cSeems like a move is imminent\u201d\n\nBitcoin may have flagged over Christmas, dipping to lows of $41,650, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView \u2014 but the tide could soon change.\n\nFor Hyland, two key BTC price indicators point the way to a short-term reversal.\n\nComing in the form of Bollinger Bands and the relative strength index (RSI), these have provided advance notice of upside in recent months.\n\n\u201cDaily Bollinger Bands are back to squeezing to the level that triggered the last two moves up through $30k and $40k. With the Daily RSI at 2-month lows, & the 3-Day MACD currently crossing down with less than 3 days to negate,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIt seems like a move is imminent here.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBollinger Bands constrict\n\nBollinger Bands are a popular volatility indicator that closely tracks BTC price action and suggests when volatility could break out.\n\nCurrently, the daily-timeframe bands are narrowing after a period of expansion \u2014 something which, while not necessarily straightaway, precedes a new round of volatility.\n\nEarlier this year, the bands collapsed to an extremely narrow position, Cointelegraph reported, in the run-up to the recovery above $30,000.\n\nHyland posted an accompanying chart showing how comparatively tight the bands currently are.\n\nBTC/USD chart with Bollinger bands data.

Source: TradingView\n\nNow at 53, RSI is firmly below the \u201coverbought\u201d 70 line \u2014 and even further below its month-to-date peak of 76.\n\nLonger timeframes are just as promising, as noted last week by veteran trader Peter Brandt.\n\nSome analysts claim that Bitcoin is terribly overbought.\n\nIn fact, the monthly RSI is currently at the sweet spot where previous bull markets have greatly accelerated their advances.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Maybe now more so than ever, the investment strategy of loading up on pick-and-shovel makers during the middle of a gold rush is playing out in the cryptocurrency world.\n\nShares of Bitcoin miners such as Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms are significantly outperforming the largest digital currency, posting gains this year of more than 800% and 400%, respectively. Meanwhile, the US crypto exchange Coinbase Global and Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy have each jumped more than 350% during the same time period. Bitcoin is up around 160% in 2023.\n\nBitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process in which miners use specialized computers to validate transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and earn rewards in the token.\n\nThe surge in the stocks comes as digital-asset mining companies expand operations to increase Bitcoin production with expectations that demand for the cryptocurrency will jump if US regulators allow exchange traded funds to hold it directly. In the next two weeks, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts forecast that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nRiot Platforms recently announced large purchases of mining machines. Marathon, the largest miner by computing power, acquired new facilities to increase its mining efficiency, a notable shift from its long-held strategy as an asset-light mining company.\n\n\u201cMarathon Digital\u2019s announcement of acquiring new sites last week could lead to stronger mining efficiency metrics,\u201d said Brian Dobson, managing director of equity research at investment bank Chardan. \u201cThat\u2019s what the investors are focused on.\u201d\n\nMarathon has gained for 11 consecutive trading sessions, more than doubling over that period to $31.07. The stock traded at more than $80 when Bitcoin reached its record high in November 2021.\n\nThe mining stocks may see more buying pressure and a short squeeze if the rally continues, pushing the prices even higher, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3.\n\nLike the majority of cryptocurrencies, most crypto stocks began 2023 at the lowest price levels of the year after a series of industry scandals and bankruptcies such as the collapse of the FTX exchange, making them a popular target to bet against.\n\n\u201cThe price move was not due to short covering from a short squeeze but from long buying pressure,\u201d Dusaniwsky said. \u201cMARA has a 100/100 squeeze score and if its stock price continues its recent trend, we should see more short covering and a definite short squeeze.\u201d\n\nThe CoinShares Blockchain Global Equity Index is up 29% in December, on pace for its best month on record.\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."
