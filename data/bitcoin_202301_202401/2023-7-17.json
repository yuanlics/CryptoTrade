        "title": "Crypto Needs Comprehensive Policies to Protect Economies and Investors - International Monetary Fund",
        "content": "The global push for clearer policies on crypto assets has gained momentum under the Indian G20 Presidency. As this work continues, it\u2019s important to recognize the progress already achieved, but more is needed, especially in implementing global standards.\n\nLast year\u2019s failures of the FTX crypto trading platform and the Terra Luna stablecoin highlighted the urgency of establishing clear policies to protect investors and prevent abuse. Despite recent industry challenges, investor optimism continues to revive periodically, as evidenced by Bitcoin\u2019s near doubling this year. Without robust safeguards, the increased risk of fraud and misconduct could adversely impact investors' expected returns.\n\nWhile some policymakers have taken necessary steps to safeguard consumers and ensure financial integrity, it is equally important to consider the broader implications of crypto. Such assets, particularly stablecoins denominated in hard currencies, could potentially replace official currencies, and significantly impact countries' monetary and fiscal policies. This is especially true in emerging markets and developing economies, underscoring the need for a comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated policy approach to crypto.\n\nThat\u2019s why we presented an assessment of the macro implications of crypto assets to the G20 presidency earlier this year, building on recommendations outlined in the Elements of Effective Policies for Crypto Assets endorsed by the IMF Executive Board in February.\n\nOur approach features three key pillars: a sound macro-policy foundation, clear legal treatment and granular rules, and effective implementation.\n\nThese are our key policy recommendations:\n\nThe defense against the substitution of sovereign currencies is the maintenance of robust, trusted, and credible domestic institutions. Transparent, consistent, and coherent monetary policy frameworks are crucial for an effective response to the challenges posed by crypto assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo protect national sovereignty, it is important not to grant crypto assets official currency or legal tender status. Doing so would require accepting them in many jurisdictions for tax payments, fines, and debt settlements, and could generate fiscal risks for government finances, and could threaten financial stability or rapid inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address the volatility of capital flows associated with crypto, policymakers should integrate them within existing regimes and rules that manage capital flows. This will help ensure stability and minimize potential disruptions.\n\nFinally, tax policies should ensure unambiguous treatment of crypto assets, and administrators should strengthen compliance efforts. Specific regulations are needed to clarify the tax treatment of crypto, including value-added taxes or levies on income or wealth.\n\nClear legal treatment\n\nBuilding on a sound macro-policy foundation, clear legal treatment and granular rules are crucial. The principle of \"same activity, same risk, same regulations\" should guide regulatory efforts.\n\nConsistent with the recommendations by standard setters such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Financial Action Task Force, Financial Stability Board, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, our recommendations are:\n\nA comprehensive legal foundation is essential to effectively regulate crypto, addressing both private law and financial law aspects. This includes ensuring predictability and enforceability of rights while appropriately classifying crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), prudential and conduct rules should be implemented to cover all entities and activities related to the issuance, trading, custody, or transfer of crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor systemic stablecoin arrangements, additional requirements such as the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures\u2014standards that aim to ensure the safety, efficiency, and resilience of FMIs\u2014should be applied.\n\nSignificantly, the FSB in July established a set of high-level recommendations for crypto regulation, focusing on financial stability. They include ensuring authorities\u2019 regulatory powers and sound governance and risk management practices by providers. It also features revised high-level recommendations for effectively addressing financial stability risks associated with \"global stablecoin\" arrangements.\n\nOverall, the recommendations promote the consistency and comprehensiveness of regulatory, supervisory and oversight approaches to crypto.\n\nEffective implementation\n\nFinally, ensuring effective policies requires several measures including strong coordination, at the domestic and international level:\n\nNational authorities must align their frameworks to the emerging guidelines, and standards being developed by standard setting bodies. This alignment is critical to achieve consistent treatment of crypto assets and may require legislative changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping strong supervisory capacity is vital for monitoring and enforcing rules effectively. Authorities must have the necessary skills and resources to oversee the evolving crypto asset landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the borderless nature of the crypto-assets ecosystem, international collaboration and information sharing are crucial. Cooperation among supervisors and competent authorities will enable the monitoring of crypto asset service providers and maintain the efficacy of regulatory policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing beyond crypto polices,public authorities should take advantage in the progress in digital technology to enhance public policy objectives and must actively collaborate to address ongoing cost, trust, and speed issues, particularly for cross-border payments. New multilateral platforms could improve the efficiency of transactions.\n\nThe IMF will continue to support the G20 by delivering to the Leaders\u2019 Summit in September a joint IMF-FSB synthesis paper highlighting the building blocks for effective crypto policies. In addition, we are committed to providing tailored capacity building to our 190 members based on the above recommendations and emerging guidelines from standard setters. Our surveillance program will also assess the effectiveness of policy frameworks including crypto.\n\nBy embracing a comprehensive approach and implementing these recommendations, policymakers can safeguard monetary sovereignty, protect investor interests, and promote financial stability in the digital age."

        "content": "Greenpeace USA Exposes BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase CEO\u2019s Affair With Climate Wrecking Bitcoin through Massive NYC Projections\n\nGreenpeace USA unveiled the climate impacts of Bitcoin investments by financial giants JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Chase) and BlackRock through visual displays projected onto iconic structures in the heart of New York City.\n\nClick here for images and videos\n\nNew York, NY (July 18, 2023) \u2013 Using stunning projections on prominent buildings in the heart of NYC, Greenpeace USA cast a spotlight on the detrimental climate impact of Bitcoin investments by financial giants JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Chase) and BlackRock. The display painted the NYC skyline with images of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Chase CEO Jamie Dimon donning red laser eyes, similar to the profiles of Bitcoin maximalists. Accompanying this visual spectacle, Greenpeace USA presented an array of facts and figures, shedding light on the undeniable climate impact associated with Bitcoin. This escalation follows the recent release of the report, Investing in Bitcoin\u2019s Climate Pollution: Big Finance is Betting on Dirty Bitcoin,\u201d and highlights the urgent need for change.\n\nThe Greenpeace USA report, published just days ago, exposes the financial institutions driving Bitcoin\u2019s climate destruction. It reveals that BlackRock, Chase, and other major players such as Fidelity, Vanguard, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express have collectively invested a staggering $1.5 billion in Bitcoin mining. By facilitating broader use of Bitcoin and offering Bitcoin-backed investment products, these companies are also accelerating the growth of Bitcoin emissions, which already rival those of countries like Sweden. This directly contradicts these financial institutions\u2019 climate commitments.\n\nBitcoin, referred to as a \u201cclimate bomb,\u201d consumes energy at an alarming scale. The majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels like coal and gas. Shockingly, coal-fired power plants that were slated for closure have been kept open or even reopened to power Bitcoin mining operations.The projections serve as a visual reminder of the critical issue at hand and demand immediate action from Chase and BlackRock.\n\nJoshua Archer, Greenpeace USA Bitcoin Campaign Lead said: \u201cEvery scientific report makes clear that we need to rapidly transition away from fossil fuels if we\u2019re going to keep our planet habitable. But influential financial leaders BlackRock and Chase are setting us back years in our urgent need to transition to renewable energy. The images we cast onto the New York City skyline are intended to hold these companies accountable for the impact their Bitcoin bets are having on climate and communities. We hope the financial services industry will engage with us to clean up Bitcoin and build a just and green future for all.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace USA invites the public to join the movement and support the organization\u2019s efforts to urge Bitcoin to adopt significantly less-energy intensive practices. The projections serve as a rallying cry, urging BlackRock, JP Morgan Chase, and other financial institutions to take immediate action.\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], 631-404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future. Greenpeace USA is committed to transforming the country\u2019s unjust social, environmental, and economic systems from the ground up to address the climate crisis, advance racial justice, and build an economy that puts people first.

        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nStandard Chartered, one of the largest banks in the United Kingdom, has made ripples in the financial world by predicting that the bitcoin price could reach $50,000 by the end of the year, and $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nStandard Chartered serves a multinational base of individual and corporate clients from its headquarters in London and although it does not conduct retail banking in the U.K., its multibillion dollar operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East make it one of the most influential financial firms in the world.\n\nAnd this prominent role in the global financial system is what makes it particularly interesting that Standard Chartered made such a bullish prediction for bitcoin earlier this month. Citing recent market activity and subsequent impacts on miners, a report published by the bank suggested that bitcoin is now set for a meteoric rise, bringing its price up to $120,000 by the end of next year.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s optimistic outlook is being bolstered by Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate, the amount of computing power being applied to secure the network by miners and an indicator of the network\u2019s strength, which recently hit an all-time high. This latest prediction upped the bank\u2019s previous call that the bitcoin price would reach $100,000 in 2024, an increase motivated by a more optimistic outlook for miner profitability.\n\n\u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d explained Standard Chartered FX analyst Geoff Kendrick.\n\nThe bitcoin price has already risen in value by some 80% since the beginning of 2023. If it jumps up to $50,000 as expected by the bank, Kendrick added that \u201cOver a year, that would reduce miner selling from 328,500 to a range of 65,700 to 98,550 \u2014 a reduction in net BTC supply of roughly 250,000 bitcoins a year.\u201d\n\nThe mining ecosystem is not the only reason to be bullish on bitcoin, however. The strong possibility of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF on the horizon could usher in a new wave of institutional investors.\n\nIt might seem overly optimistic to claim that bitcoin\u2019s price will end up quadrupling over the next year and a half, even with its historic volatility. But there are clear reasons why such a large bank has such confidence in Bitcoin. Hard data shows that the mining industry is thawing from \u201ccrypto winter\u201d to become stronger than ever, regulatory approval years in the making appears imminent and BTC has once again emerged from a cycle low with strong momentum.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Hype around spot bitcoin ETFs has spiked in the last month, but patience from prospective issuers and industry watchers will be key as the SEC reviews the latest wave of filings.\n\nThe SEC officially added Bitwise\u2019s proposed spot bitcoin ETF to its federal register on Tuesday \u2014 triggering the start of a 240-day clock for the SEC to make a ruling on the proposal \u2014 though there are other deadlines to keep an eye on.\n\nSimilar funds by BlackRock, Fidelity and others are expected to be added to the register in short order, initiating the countdown for rulings on those as well.\n\nThough many are paying attention to the SEC\u2019s ruling schedule for BlackRock\u2019s planned spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 the perceived favorite by some to launch first \u2014 an unrelated deadline in mid-August could send a signal to the asset manager and other issuers.\n\nDeadline coming for proposal by Ark Invest, 21Shares\n\nThe SEC has until Aug. 13 to essentially approve, deny or delay a bitcoin ETF by 21Shares and Ark Invest.\n\nThe deadline represents the second stage of a 240-day process broken into four periods \u2014 45 days, 45 days, 90 days and 60 days. At the end of the first three periods, the SEC must either allow the planned product to launch, block it from doing so, or ask for more time.\n\nThe SEC cannot ask for more time at the end of 240 days \u2014 a period set to expire on Jan. 10.\n\nSwitzerland-based 21Shares and New York-headquartered Ark Invest together refiled for a spot bitcoin ETF in April after the SEC rejected its previous attempt in March 2022. The latest proposal was published to the federal register on May 15, setting up a June 29 initial deadline \u2014 45 days later \u2014 for the SEC.\n\nAs expected by many industry watchers, the SEC requested more time. The ruling came two weeks before the deadline.\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d the June 15 filing states.\n\nAug. 13 marks 45 days from the June 29 deadline. By that date, the SEC will either issue a ruling on the planned product or request an extension for further consideration.\n\nThe initial rulings are often telling of how the SEC will treat the proposal later on, industry watchers said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exceedingly rare for the SEC to approve an ETF filing after so much obvious angst, with multiple extensions and filing/re-filings and so on,\u201d according to Lara Crigger, editor-in-chief at data firm VettaFi.\n\nThe process has changed from years ago when the SEC would let ETF proposals \u201clive in SEC limbo\u201d for years instead of being denied, Crigger added. Such was the case with cannabis ETFs until 2017, when the ETF Managers Group was finally able to change its Latin America Real Estate ETF (LARE) to the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ).\n\n\u201cThey are now forced to make a decision one way or another,\u201d Crigger told Blockworks. \u201cHence, the extensions, withdrawals, re-filings, and so on.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said he is paying attention to the SEC\u2019s decisions early in the 240-day window.\n\n\u201cThe odds of the SEC \u2014 after going through that process of the 45-day period, 45 days, 90 days and 60 days \u2014 then all of a sudden the SEC accepting and approving seems a little skeptical to me if this surveillance-sharing agreement is the silver bullet we\u2019ve been looking for,\u201d Seyffart said earlier this month on the ETF Prime Podcast.\n\nSSA at the heart of latest bitcoin ETF filings\n\nA surveillance-sharing agreement, or SSA, is at the center of the active spot bitcoin ETF filings.\n\nRead more: How \u2018surveillance-sharing\u2019 is designed to deter bitcoin ETF manipulation\n\nIn a filing on June 15, Nasdaq, the potential listing exchange for BlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF, disclosed its readiness to establish a surveillance-sharing agreement with \u201can operator of a US-based spot trading platform for bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe company later amended filings to name Coinbase as the platform.\n\nCboe amended filings last week on behalf of Ark Invest and 21Shares \u2014 as well as several other fund groups \u2014 stating in the latest documents that it \u201creached an agreement on terms,\u201d with Coinbase to enter into SSAs.\n\n\u201cThey can delay again and say we need to see the actual SSA,\u201d Seyffart added on the podcast. \u201cAnd then we can get to another deadline and see what happens there.\u201d\n\nOther deadlines become clearer\n\nThe US securities regulator last week formally acknowledged the bitcoin ETF applications by Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree and VanEck.\n\nThe step precedes the SEC publishing the proposals to the federal register \u2014 an action that initiates the 240-day clock for it to rule on the proposals.\n\nBitwise\u2019s proposed ETF appeared on the federal register Tuesday.\n\nUnless the SEC publishes the other proposals to the register today, there won\u2019t be a \u201ccommon clock\u201d for the latest wave of filings, Seyffart said in a Tuesday tweet \u2014 meaning applications could be ruled on in the order they were filed.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts believed such a \u201ccommon clock\u201d might indicate positive news for ultimate approval on the same day, he added.\n\n\u201cThis obviously doesn\u2019t mean definitive approval or denial either way,\u201d Seyffart said in a separate tweet. \u201cWe were just just looking for any indication as to which way they may be leaning. But the SEC isn\u2019t showing their hand.\u201d\n\nIf the SEC takes the full 240 days to rule on the proposed Bitwise fund \u2014 and others expected to hit the federal register soon \u2014 such decisions would come in mid-March.\n\nCrigger said she believes approvals will be tough to achieve, noting not much has substantially changed regarding the surveillance requirements from the SEC and the regulatory landscape.\n\n\u201cIt really does seem like would-be bitcoin ETF issuers and the SEC are at an impasse,\u201d \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll refile with some tweaks. Maybe they\u2019ll give up.\u201d"

        "title": "In \"Easy Money,\" crypto's central premise is put to the test - Marketplace",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has had a rough time in the past year or so. The value of bitcoin has fallen to less than half its peak of $65,000 back in the fall of 2021, and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is facing criminal charges over his role in the meltdown of the prominent crypto exchange. Yet as the crypto industry tries to move past what some are calling a crypto winter, skeptics are questioning its very premise: Is it even possible to realize the promise of a \u201cdecentralized\u201d currency? Is crypto, as an idea, flawed?\n\n\u201cThese cryptocurrencies are not currencies, economically speaking, because they don\u2019t do what money does,\u201d actor and writer Ben McKenzie said in an interview with \u201cMarketplace\u201d host Kai Ryssdal. \u201cMoney, ultimately is trust. Cryptocurrency famously says, \u2018Oh, we can replace that. Crypto can be a trustless form of money where all you have to do is trust the code.\u2019 But code does not fall from the sky.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie, along with his collaborator, Jacob Silverman, investigated the crypto industry writ large in their new book, \u201cEasy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud.\u201d What they found was a sector prone to both speculation and fraud.\n\nIn the following excerpt, McKenzie (who possesses a 20-something-year-old economics degree) takes a closer look at the \u201ccurrency\u201d bit of \u201ccryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThe first problem I had with cryptocurrency was the word. They were using the wrong one.\n\nIn economics, currencies do things: They are a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Medium of exchange means you use it to buy and sell stuff. Most people, if pressed, will define money this way: You buy shit with it. If we didn\u2019t have money, we\u2019d have to rely on bartering for the things we need. As an actor/performer, I\u2019d literally be singing for my supper, which, if you have ever heard me sing, would be a terrible idea. Money simplifies things, creating a quantifiable system of IOUs we Americans call dollars. Unit of account is a way of measuring the market value of goods, services, and other transactions against each other. A stable currency allows an economy to function efficiently; businesses can run their books and monitor their performance over time. The last function of money\u2014store of value\u2014is exactly that: something that holds its value over time. A strong currency has a relatively steady value over time. What good is a dollar if one day my deli bagel costs $1.50, the next $10, and the next $5? I\u2019d rather skip breakfast. The more a currency fluctuates in value, the less useful it is to the public, to businesses, and to the government that issues it.\n\nCryptocurrencies didn\u2019t do any of these things well. You couldn\u2019t buy stuff with them\u2014the guys at my deli would look at me like I was nuts if I tried to pay for my bagel and coffee in Bitcoin. Advocates say this is a temporary problem; if more people would just buy Bitcoin, eventually it will become a currency you can actually use. That\u2019s wrong for many reasons, but I\u2019ll focus on the simplest one for now: The technology behind Bitcoin sucks. It doesn\u2019t scale. Satoshi\u2019s solution to the double spend problem was innovative, but also clunky. The more miners who entered the competition the more energy was used, but the blocks were the same. Bitcoin is able to handle only five to seven transactions a second; it can never go above that. Visa can process 24,000. To operate, Bitcoin uses an enormous amount of energy, the equivalent in 2021 of Argentina\u2014the entire country. Visa and Mastercard use comparatively minuscule amounts of electricity to serve a customer base orders of magnitude greater. Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is enormously wasteful, and poses a massive environmental problem for the supposedly cutting-edge technology (and really, for all of us).\n\nWhen it came to the other two functions of money\u2014store of value and unit of account\u2014Bitcoin also fails miserably. The price jumps up and down like a rabbit on amphetamines, making it impossible to run a business using Bitcoin (or any other crypto) or hold on to it for any period of time with reasonable confidence it would retain its value. Could you use a cryptocurrency as a rudimentary form of money? I mean, sure. You could call a brick a soccer ball, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it that way.\n\nSo if cryptocurrencies weren\u2019t currencies, then what were they? How do they actually work in the real world? Well, you put real money into them and hope to make real money off of them through no work of your own. Under American law, that\u2019s an investment contract. More precisely, it\u2019s a security.\n\nThanks to a 1946 Supreme Court decision, securities are often defined by what\u2019s called the Howey Test. The test has four prongs: (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with the expectation of profit, (4) to be derived from the efforts of others. Check, check, check, and check. Although Bitcoin had somehow come to be classified as a commodity, it was blindingly clear to me that the 20,000 or so other cryptos ought to be classified as securities under American law, and yet they had not been, or at least not clearly enough to stop them from spreading like wildfire.\n\nPrior to the 1930s we did not have federal securities laws in the United States. Securities were regulated at the state level under what were called blue-sky laws. They did not work very well. Fraud was commonplace; the stock markets in particular reflected a capitalistic free-for-all with little to no outside oversight. (Recall [John Maynard] Keynes and the origin of the term casino capitalism.) While everything was going up in price, no one seemed to mind. During the roaring twenties, millions of Americans were lured into booming markets with faulty foundations. It was a bubble, and like all bubbles it eventually burst. The stock market crash of 1929 destroyed the finances of multitudes and ultimately led to the Great Depression. In response to this devastation, and the manipulation and fraud in the markets that contributed to it, Congress passed federal securities laws in 1933 and 1934. In terms of protecting investors, the primary purpose of those laws was to require disclosure on behalf of the issuer; if you were investing money in a particular security, you needed to know what you were investing in (i.e., who you were giving your money to) and what they were doing with that money. Cryptocurrencies have no disclosure requirements, effectively by design; the pseudonymity of the blockchain conceals who owns what. Much like the 1920s, this left the door wide open for deception and scams.\n\nStaring in disbelief at the crypto markets in the spring of 2021, I came to a terrifying conclusion: Slightly less than a century after the crash of 1929, we had come full circle. There were now potentially 20,000 unregistered, unlicensed securities\u2014more than all the publicly listed securities in the major US stock markets\u2014for sale to the general public. Worse, these unregistered, unlicensed securities were primarily traded on crypto exchanges, which often served multiple market functions and, therefore, had massive conflicts of interest. And perhaps most disturbing, most of the volume in crypto ran through overseas exchanges. Rather than being registered in the United States, they were often run through shell corporations in the Caribbean, apparently to avoid falling under any particular regulatory jurisdiction. Private entities were essentially printing their own money and circulating it through offshore markets. In terms of propensity for fraud, what could be more appealing? Stepping back even further, what did these cryptocurrencies do? From where did their value derive? They were bizarre. Imagine a conventional security, such as a share of stock in the company Apple. Where does that stock get its value? Well, Apple makes stuff. (The iPhone is one year older than the Bitcoin white paper.) Apple sells that stuff\u2014phones, computers, watches\u2014as well as services, such as streaming music and video subscriptions. These sales produce a revenue stream\u2014earnings over time that can be projected forward. When you buy a share of Apple, you are effectively buying a portion of the revenue stream, as well as the brand equity, market share, intellectual property\u2014all of that. But cryptos don\u2019t make stuff or do stuff. There are no goods or services produced. It\u2019s air, pure securitized air.\n\nExcerpted from the new book \u201cEasy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud\u201d by Ben McKenzie with Jacob Silverman, published by Abrams Press.

        "content": "The best argument in favor of approving new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds is that they already exist, tracking futures. Sadly for the crypto crowd, that\u2019s also the best argument for why nobody needs a new one.\n\nProponents say that the arrival of a US spot ETF would open the floodgates to a new wave of investors, potentially ushering in more than $50 billion of demand. A fresh batch of applications led by asset management titan BlackRock Inc. reignited optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission may finally give its blessing after more than a decade of denials, powering a 20% Bitcoin rally since mid-June."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accepted asset manager BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), signalling a major step for the potential launch of the country\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSee related article: BlackRock files for spot Bitcoin ETF, taps Coinbase as custodian\n\nFast facts\n\nOn July 13, the SEC added BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application to its list of proposed rulemaking filings for the Nasdaq stock market \u2014 a move that signals the regulatory body\u2019s intent to take the application seriously.\n\nGiven BlackRock\u2019s global stature in the asset management industry, that signal is considered significant as a potential indicator of greater institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to come.\n\nThe move follows BlackRock\u2019s filing of an amended Bitcoin ETF application in late June. SEC officials reportedly expressed concern that the original ETF applications filed by BlackRock and other asset managers were not sufficiently comprehensive.\n\nTo convince the regulators, BlackRock has added a \u201csurveillance-sharing\u201d agreement with U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase to its updated application. Competitors including Ark Invest, Fidelity Investments and others are also filing similar amendments to their respective Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nOn July 14, the day after the BlackRock decision, the SEC also added the Bitcoin ETF applications of WisdomTree, VanEck, Fidelity and Invesco Galaxy to its docket.\n\nBlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager with over US$9.4 trillion in assets. The firm filed for its first spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, fueling optimism for further institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF allows customers to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the token, and can be traded on traditional stock markets. The U.S. SEC approved the nation\u2019s first Bitcoin futures ETF on June 23, but is so far yet to give the green light to a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nElsewhere, Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 proposed by Jacobi Asset Management \u2014 is expected to be publicly listed this month. That follows a 12-month delay from the initially planned date, according to reporting by the Financial Times.\n\nSee related article: US SEC says Bitcoin ETF applications inadequate: WSJ"

        "content": "Bitcoin briefly fell under US$30,000 in early Tuesday morning trading in Asia before recovering back above that support line. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies declined, with Solana leading the losers. Polygon\u2019s Matic was the exception, adding more than one percent at one point. NFT trading slumped and U.S. stock futures traded flat after gains on Monday. The week ahead brings rafts of earnings, including from major U.S. banks on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin, Ether slip\n\nBitcoin lost 0.55% over the last 24 hours to US$30,160.39 as of 06:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, falling 0.62% for the week, according to data from CryptoMarketCap. The token dipped to US$29,685.78 at one point in early morning Asia trading on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOn a weekly timeframe, Bitcoin is trending up on the highs and lows, but down on the close and open,\u201d said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based online brokerage FxPro. \u201cFailure to rally from current levels opens the door for a correction to the $27,000 area if risk-off sentiment intensifies later in the week.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency with a current market capitalization of US$586 billion has attracted bouts of buying interest following several filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in June, including one by the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock.\n\nOn July 13, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally accepted the Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, WisdomTree, VanEck and others for review.\n\nWhen measured by investments in crypto-focused funds, Bitcoin has seen inflows of US$140 million in the last week, or 99% of the total invested in such funds, according to asset manager CoinShares. A total US$742 million was invested in crypto funds over the last 4 weeks, the largest since the final quarter of 2021, according to CoinShares data.\n\nEther declined by 1.07% to US$1,913.56, but was still holding gains of 2.03% in the last seven days. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were in the red, though Polygon\u2019s Matic added to weekly gains of 5.99%. Matic rose 0.37% to US$0.781 in early trade and gained further later in the morning.\n\nLast Thursday, Polygon Labs announced a new, revamped version of its native token named Pol, which the company claims will be more secure, scalable and frictionless.\n\nSolana was the biggest loser among the top 10 falling 3.26% to US$26.74. However that could be from profit-taking as the token has jumped 25.55% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 0.49% in the past 24 hours to US$1.21 trillion, while trading volume rose 42.52% to US$35.54 billion.\n\nNFTs in \u201csubstantial slowdown\u201d\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.27% in the past 24 hours to 2,719.10 as of 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 0.43% for the week.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index is down following a very slow day of trading,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cFocusing on Ethereum trading we see 14,006 total transactions on Sunday, which is the lowest in almost 2 years, when we saw 13,560 transactions on July 24, 2021.\u201d\n\nPetscher said the number of unique buyers fell under 10,000, also a substantial slowdown in the NFT market.\n\nForkast\u2019s NFT market indices measuring the performance on Ethereum, Solana and Cardano blockchains rose, while the Polygon index dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume gained 1.45% to US$18.51 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum-based art NFT collection Opepen Edition topped the trading volume rankings on CryptoSlam, rising 2.93% in the last 24 hours to US$782,290.\n\n\u201cOpepen is an interesting hybrid project that merges conceptual art into easy to digest profile pictures,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cInfluencers and even large Web3 entities like OpenSea and Rarible are getting in on the fun by changing their profile pictures to an Opepen that matches their brand.\u201d\n\nImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained Cards, the collection of NFTs used in Immutable\u2019s trading card game of the same name, placed second in 24-hour trading volume, despite falling 2.19% to US$675,685.\n\nElsewhere, NFL Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said on Twitter Monday that he will launch his second line of NFTs inspired by his football career. The new collectibles are expected in September, according to Decrypt.\n\nU.S. stock futures little changed, Asia markets lower\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after all three major U.S. indexes gained during regular trading on Monday.\n\nStocks in main Asia markets fell back after China on Monday reported lower-than-expected economic growth of 6.3% for Q2. The Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 all posted losses as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the U.S., more bank earnings are coming later today from Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley & Co., which follow positive quarterly results last week from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. Earnings from Goldman Sachs Group, Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines are expected Wednesday.\n\nThe view that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its cycle of raising interest rates helped the Wall Street gains on Monday, according to Trading Economics. That sentiment grew as last week\u2019s producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, came in well below analyst expectations.\n\nStill, the Fed is likely to raise rates again above the current 5% to 5.25%. Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said last week at an event hosted by New York University that the central bank will need two more 25-basis-point rate increases this year to tame inflation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97.3% chance the Fed will raise by 25-basis-points, up from 96.1% on Monday.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has spent almost a month at or near $30,000, but this is no coincidence, new analysis claims.\n\nIn one of its Quicktake market updates on July 17, on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant highlighted three key factors keeping BTC price action in the same place.\n\nBitcoin speculators in the driving seat\n\nBitcoin has rebuffed any attempt at a breakout for weeks on end, making casual one-year highs but always falling lower afterward.\n\nFor CryptoQuant contributor Axel Adler, this has roots \u2014 among other things \u2014 in speculative trading.\n\nShort-term holders (STHs), he notes, have divested themselves of their holdings since April, leading to increased selling pressure above $30,000.\n\n\u201cThis group is actively selling off their Bitcoin reserves, exerting significant pressure on the market,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThis indicates that short-term investors are actively liquidating their assets, thereby locking in their profits.\u201d\n\nCryptoQuant defines STHs as entities hodling coins for six months or less.\n\nBitcoin STH supply annotated chart. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nOther recent data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode led analysts to the conclusion that the STH cost basis \u2014 recently around $26,400 \u2014 is likewise keeping BTC price action afloat in times of more pronounced downside pressure.\n\nMiner selling preempts Bitcoin halving\n\nBitcoin miners are also on the radar this quarter as higher BTC prices spark an uptick in sales.\n\nFor Adler, selling BTC holdings to cover expenses ahead of the block subsidy halving in 2024 marks another factor influencing price performance today.\n\n\u201cMiners are actively selling their Bitcoin reserves,\u201d he summarized.\n\n\u201cThis is not a random occurrence; we have seen peak sales over the last year. This is connected to the upcoming halving event when the reward for mining Bitcoin decreases by half. Miners require liquidity to invest in new equipment to stay competitive.\u201d\n\nBitcoin miner exchange inflow realized price annotated chart. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, mining pool Poolin recently contributed extensive exchange inflows, sending large tranches of BTC to Binance. This has since become a topic of speculation amid rumors over the pool\u2019s financial buoyancy.\n\nReal BTC price volatility absent\n\nBitcoin volatility remains among its lowest in terms of historical context.\n\nRelated: BTC traders brace for $30K loss \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nCryptoQuant reveals a net slowdown in trading activity since April, as those taking profit hope for a more substantial breakout to come.\n\nData from TradingView shows the Bitcoin historical volatility index at 14.77 as of July 18 \u2014 far below even its 2023 peak.\n\nBitcoin historical volatility index chart.

        "content": "Fidelity Digital Assets released a \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report\u201d on July 18, which claimed that Ether\u2019s outlook for the next 12 months and the long term is positive. Year-to-date, Ether (ETH) has gained 62%, but while the investment firm might be short-term bullish on Ether, that does not mean it believes that the month-long bullish channel will be sustained.\n\nWhile institutional investors like Fidelity Digital Assets may have a bullish longer-term vision for ETH's price, let\u2019s compare their analysis against network and market data to see if they\u2019re on the money.\n\nEther/USD 1-day price index. Source: TradingView\n\nBeyond the technical indicators, the rationale behind Fidelity\u2019s bullish outlook for Ether is the network\u2019s higher burn rate versus coin issuance, the \u201cnew address momentum\u201d and a growth in the number of network validators.\n\nFidelity \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report,\u201d July 18. Source: Fidelity Digital Assets\n\nAccording to the Fidelity report, the net issuance since the Merge in September 2022 resulted in a net supply decrease of more than 700,000 Ether. Additionally, the analysts claim that Glassnode data showing an increasing number of Ethereum addresses that transacted for the first time ever proves healthy network adoption.\n\nThe report also points to a 15% increase in the number of active Ethereum validators in the second quarter.\n\nThe expectation around EIP-1153 is also building momentum for the Ethereum network, as the \u201ctransient storage opcode\u201d improves smart contract efficiency, reduces costs and amplifies the Ethereum Virtual Machine design. The change is especially meaningful for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where Ethereum\u2019s dominance declined to 46% from 60% six months prior, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nDencun upgrade expected to reduce transaction costs\n\nAnother potentially bullish factor for the Ethereum network is the anticipated upgrade on the leading DEX, Uniswap. According to a July 17 presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference, the upcoming Uniswap v4 will allow users to build unlimited types of pools using programmable buttons (hooks), native ETH support and a singleton contract that performs internal transactions before settling final balances.\n\nThe announcement fueled the likelihood that EIP-1153 will be included in the next \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade, which triggered Slingshot and DeFi Pulse co-founder Scott Lewis.\n\ni had missed the news that uniswap labs got eip1153 into cancun.\n\n\n\nthey kept the details for wanting eip1153 secret from the community, only publishing v4 only after inclusion was finalized.\n\n\n\ninformal governance captured by an insider-aligned, for-profit monopoly. sad day. \u2014 scottlewis.canto\u2795 (@scott_lew_is) June 13, 2023\n\nIf approved, the implementation will be vital for the Ethereum network to recoup the market share lost due to high gas fees, as the seven-day average transaction cost has been above $4 since February. Consequently, Ethereum\u2019s total value locked has dropped to its lowest level since April 2020, at 13.55 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nMoreover, decentralized application activity has dwindled, as shown by DappRadar\u2019s unique active wallets\u2019 30-day data: Uniswap, minus 28%; 1inch Network, minus 14%; MetaMask Swap, minus 8%; and OpenSea, minus 5%. As a comparison, in the same period, BNB Smart Chain\u2019s PancakeSwap gained 10%, and Polygon\u2019s Uniswap users increased 8%.\n\nDerivatives metrics remain flat\n\nEther quarterly futures have been signaling unease among professional traders. Those fixed-month contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% premium compared to spot markets to compensate for the delayed settlement, a situation known as contango.\n\nEther 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to data from Laevitas, the Ether three-month futures premium currently stands at 4%, which is below the neutral threshold and lower than the 5.5% level seen on July 14. This indicator is clear evidence that traders are less inclined to use leverage for bullish ETH positions.\n\nMore concerningly, Ether\u2019s 59% gains year-to-date might have caused investors to become overly optimistic. A recent survey from CryptoVantage of 1,000 North Americans that invested in cryptocurrencies over the past five years found that 46% named Ether as the top contender to surpass Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nRelated: Bitcoin rally will lead to \"speculative blow-off top\u201d in 2024, Mark Yusko predicts\n\nCoins with the best chances of surpassing Bitcoin. Source: 2023 CryptoVantage survey\n\nThis is a somewhat startling point of view, but it could be misleading since the survey did not ask whether any coin would eventually flip Bitcoin, so respondents don\u2019t necessarily place strong odds on this outcome.\n\nFidelity\u2019s analysis has given valid reasons for why the firm is bullish on Ether\u2019s 12-month price performance, but in the shorter term, the recurrent high gas fees and lack of interest from leverage buyers signal increased odds of the Ether price breaking below the channel support.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "DUBAI, UAE / ACCESSWIRE / July 18, 2023 / Unlike the halving of Litecoin, which had no substantial effect on its price in the past, the halving of Bitcoin is currently one of the major expected events in the crypto market. Bitcoin is set to undergo a periodic halving in 2024.* BITmarkets has identified bitcoin halving as one of the major events for the crypto trading community. The trader's perspective on the phenomenon of halving is a part of 2023 Mid-Year Crypto Outlook.\n\nBITmarkets, Tuesday, July 18, 2023, Press release picture\n\n\"After the challenges of 2022, the current year seems to have blown a wind of change indeed. The possibility of cryptocurrencies aiming back towards the highs of 2021 during the upcoming year can be realistic, given revitalizing market conditions. Of course, there are risks, or in other words, obstacles along the way, but current market conditions may indicate a rather prosperous development and outcome for cryptocurrencies in the near future,\" says Peter Sumer, COO of BITmarkets, on the findings of the Outlook study.\n\n2023 has started strong for cryptocurrencies and other financial market assets, combatting headwinds with fierce force and retaining hard-earned value. Among the trends of the current year and the ones to follow are several: more regulation, rise of central bank digital currencies, popularization of DeFi, more investments into stablecoins and the revitalization or deterioration of NFTs.\n\nIdentity verification strictness may increase as more cyberattacks and hacks have been detected in recent times. Increased regulation is intended to safeguard the funds and data of crypto traders. This can come in the form of increasing scrutiny of identity verification, which can bolster the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks set in place.\n\nOther legal measures such as passing new laws that tackle money laundering and necessitating accurate & recurrent corporate reporting can achieve higher consumer protection.\n\nMore information on trends and upcoming events in the world of crypto traders is to be found in the 2023 Mid-Year Crypto Outlook: Crypto Trends to Watch & 2024 Bitcoin Halving, a study by BITmarkets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBITmarkets is a crypto exchange that operates in more than 15 languages and offers 24/7 support in local languages. Besides spot trading, clients are enabled to unique futures options with 100+ cryptocurrencies.

The initial block reward for BTC was 50 BTC, while the current block reward stands at 6.25 BTC, and the next block reward will be 3.125 BTC, and the halving continues. This event, programmed into the Bitcoin code, slows down the rate at which Bitcoins are mined and generated. The main incentive behind this action is to limit the total supply of BTC, which shall be maxed out at 21,000,000 BTC.\n\nPR Contact:\n\nZEX PR WIRE\n\ninfo@zexprwire.com\n\nSOURCE: BITmarkets\n\n\n\n\n\nView source version on accesswire.com:\n\nhttps://www.accesswire.com/768435/Bitcoin-Halving-Amongst-Major-Events-to-Watch-in-the-Crypto-Market\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "On-chain data examined by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has revealed that roughly 29% of all bitcoins (BTC) in circulation have remained unmoved for more than five years.\n\nIn a Monday tweet, analysts at the firm said a large part of the unmoved assets might be lost coins.\n\nEver wondered how many Bitcoins are lost forever? Our data shows that 29% of $BTC hasn\u2019t moved in over 5 years. It\u2019s possible that a large part of this concerns lost coins. #Bitcoin \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) July 17, 2023\n\n29% of BTC Lost?\n\nIntoTheBlock\u2019s latest analysis echoes a recent report from crypto exchange Bitfinex, which disclosed that the amount of unmoved BTC has reached a new all-time high, leading to a decrease in the asset\u2019s liquidity.\n\nBitfinex also reported that approximately 70% of BTC\u2019s circulating supply has remained dormant for at least a year; this is the highest ever recorded since the inception of the leading crypto asset.\n\nWhile there is no specific reason for the current and prolonged dormancy of a significant portion of BTC, several factors are considered to have led to the development.\n\nAs IntoTheBlock\u2019s analysts speculated, most of the coins could be lost forever. On the other hand, it could be a sign of growing interest from investors, especially institutions, who have a bullish sentiment toward Bitcoin and believe in the asset\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nThe HODLing attitude from both large and institutional investors indicates an expectation of positive price action for BTC, showing that they consider the crypto asset a viable investment option.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Upcoming Halving Event\n\nAnother factor to consider is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event slated for April 2024. Every four years, at 210,000 blocks, a mechanism in the Bitcoin network slashes the block reward for BTC mining by half. Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving will reduce block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nThe event is viewed as a bullish sign because it enhances BTC\u2019s prospective scarcity, supports its supply-demand dynamics, and affects its value positively.\n\nAs the halving approaches, crypto funds and investment firms are accumulating BTC at its current price level, increasing their holdings, and positioning themselves for positive price action."

        "content": "Having slipped over the weekend, Bitcoin rose to trade at over US$30,300 on Monday morning in Asia. The price has now reverted to around the level posted last Thursday \u2014 prior to XRP issuer Ripple\u2019s favorable ruling in its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The partial victory led to significant gains for a number of top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, with XRP still leading the gains. U.S. stock futures edged lower as investors await earnings reports from major banks.\n\nBitcoin falls back\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.05% over the last 24 hours to US$30,332.54 as of 06:30 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly gain of 0.65%, according to data from CryptoMarketCap.\n\nHowever, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency was trading at around US$31,300 early Saturday morning. Following that weekend high, the token\u2019s price reverted to roughly its pre-Ripple ruling level.\n\nIn a summary judgment Thursday, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of the XRP token on public exchanges do not constitute securities. The regulator first sued the San Francisco-based financial technology firm on the grounds that XRP constitutes a security in 2020.\n\nThe ruling was deemed something of a partial victory for Ripple, however, as the court ruled that XRP sales to institutional investors did violate securities laws.\n\n\u201cThere will be further court proceedings on that part \u2026 It is also not yet known if the SEC will appeal to the ruling,\u201d said Caroline Bowler, CEO of Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, in emailed comments. Therefore, there remains the \u201cpotential for more insecurity ahead for Ripple,\u201d Bowler added.\n\nNonetheless, Ripple Labs\u2019 XRP led the gainers Monday morning in Asia. It rose 5.58% to US$0.7577 for a weekly surge of 61.56%.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC has added BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to its official docket. That decision means that the regulator will now review the proposal in a serious manner.\n\nBlackrock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with over US$9 trillion in assets, filed the application a little less than a month ago. The move saw the token\u2019s value breach the US$31,000 resistance level earlier this month as multiple major asset managers followed suit with similar ETF proposals.\n\nEther also gained 0.20% to US$1,934.09, rising 3.81% in the past seven days.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. The day\u2019s biggest losses were logged by Dogecoin, which dipped 2.53% to US$0.07. However, the token still recorded gains of 6.89% for the week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA also fell 2.52% to US$0.3185, limiting the coin\u2019s weekly gain to 12.08%. Similarly, Binance\u2019s BNB lost 2.43% to US$244.95. It is nonetheless trading at 4.68% higher than a week ago.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 0.16% in the past 24 hours to US$1.22 trillion, while trading volume fell 11.97% to US$24.91 billion.\n\nToken-gated access for the super-rich and The Flash via NFT\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

However, the index is down 0.40% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Solana and Cardano NFT market indices also moved higher, while the Ethereum and Polygon indices dropped.\n\n\u201cNFTs continue to ride the wave of positive news and positive prices in crypto,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cHowever we\u2019re not seeing any noteworthy gains in projects and instead most of the big names are still down for the past 7 days.\u201d\n\nThat is despite some large CryptoPunk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) sales in the past week. Those sales included BAYC #1734, which sold for $1.2m (600ETH), CryptoPunk #8531 for $1m (550 ETH), and CryptoPunk #9476 for $403k (217.5 ETH).\n\n\u201cBig sales sometimes trickle liquidity to other projects, but in this case, the seller may be pocketing their gains or investing in crypto, where opportunities seem brighter at the moment,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the total NFT transaction volume dipped 10.93% to US$16.58 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained Cards, the collection of NFTs used in Immutable\u2019s trading card game of the same name, topped the 24-hour transaction volume, despite edging down 0.43% to US$690,896.\n\nEthereum-based NFT staple BAYC placed second in Cryptoslam\u2019s collections ranking. Its total transaction volume rose 1.34% to US$660,415 in the past 24 hours. Bored Ape creator Yuga Labs announced last week that it will hold ApeFest \u2014 a celebratory event of its successful NFT collections \u2014 in Hong Kong in November.\n\nApeFest is going global.\n\nHong Kong.\n\nNov 3-5, 2023.https://t.co/Fxgb7RuVek pic.twitter.com/X2QVVd7Qxr \u2014 Bored Ape Yacht Club (@BoredApeYC) July 13, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, non-blockchain sectors are also displaying increased NFT activity. .\n\nIndosuez, the global wealth management subsidiary of major French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, launched a private NFT membership club last week named Le Clu3. The club will cater to super-rich clients by offering token-gated access to secret sections of its website, among other otherwise off-limits experiences. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole had roughly US$2.712 trillion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nElsewhere, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. \u2014 the American entertainment conglomerate with over US$30 billion in market capitalization \u2014 has announced that it will launch its upcoming superhero film \u201cThe Flash\u201d via NFT. The launch is hosted by the Eluvio blockchain and will allow user access to the film itself, collectibles, bonus features and character artwork.\n\nIt\u2019s official, The Flash is the first new release movie to hit the blockchain! pic.twitter.com/sScukkA6Fw \u2014 Warner Bros. Digital Collectibles (@WarnerBrosNFT) July 14, 2023\n\nStock futures reflect positive investor sentiment\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down by less than 0.1% as of 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular Friday trading.\n\nThe three indexes all rose by around 2% to 3% last week. Following the latest release of U.S. inflation data on July 12, which came in softer than expected, investors are hopeful that the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s extended round of interest rate hikes may soon draw to a close.\n\nHowever, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based brokerage firm FxPro, believes that recent positive investor sentiment may backfire.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has made sharp reversals before, but always after a spike in market volatility,\u201d Kuptsikevich said. \u201cSteadily rising stock prices are more likely to spur the central bank to tighten monetary policy further,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Fed is still looking to add more to its current interest rate of 5% to 5.25%. Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said last week at an event hosted by New York University that the central bank will need to enact two more 25-basis-point rate increases this year to tame inflation.\n\n\u201cThe robust strength of the labor market and the solid overall performance of the U.S. economy gives us room to tighten policy further,\u201d Waller said during the speech.\n\n\u201cIf inflation does not continue to show progress and there are no suggestions of a significant slowdown in economic activity, then a second 25-basis-point hike should come sooner rather than later, but that decision is for the future,\u201d Waller continued.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 96.1% chance the Fed will enact a 25-basis-point rate increase this month, up from 92.4% on Friday.\n\nLast week\u2019s earnings reports from major U.S. banks JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup added to the increasingly hopeful market sentiment. Investors now await reports from financial heavyweights including the Bank of America Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Co. and The Goldman Sachs Group. Earnings reports from Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines are also due Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, major stock indexes across Asia fell on Monday as China posted lower-than-expected economic growth of 6.3% for Q2. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all posted losses as of 12:00 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

        "content": "Crypto exchange Binance enabled deposits and withdrawals on Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network on Monday.\n\nLightning is now alongside other options including Bitcoin mainnet, BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum.\n\nLightning serves as a layer-2 scaling solution for Bitcoin. The network is intended to speed up transactions and reduce fees, reminiscent of Ethereum layer-2 protocols like Optimism.\n\nIt supports direct payment channels between users, allowing bitcoin (BTC) to be sent off-chain while settling on-chain in batches. This design has presented its own risk profile, with Lightning developers warning users that the software is still under development.\n\n\u201cMost software deployed in the Lightning Network is still considered beta software, meaning it may contain bugs that could lead to irrevocable loss of funds. For most operators, the biggest risks are data loss from power outages, hardware failures and bugs,\u201d per Lightning\u2019s FAQ.\n\nBitcoin sent over Lightning should appear in seconds, with the network often used for micropayments and real-world transactions. Twitter, for instance, enabled BTC tipping in 2021 via payments app Strike, which uses Lightning.\n\nBinance pledged to integrate Lightning last month but said doing so required further technical work.\n\nOther exchanges such as Bitfinex, Kraken, River Financial and OKX have already integrated Lightning into their platforms. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in April hinted that his platform may do the same but hasn\u2019t yet provided a specific timeline.\n\nLightning adoption has steadily increased over the past few years, although it hasn\u2019t been without hiccups. There\u2019s about 4,900 BTC ($148.2 million) on the network right now \u2014 up from under 1,000 BTC ($30.2 million) in 2020.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

This signals the SEC\u2019s intent to seriously consider the ETF applications.\n\n\u201cPositive news regarding Bitcoin ETFs could significantly boost investor sentiment,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF would be a major step toward mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, signaling regulatory confidence and potentially paving the way for significant institutional investment.

Ripple\u2019s XRP token was the exception, gaining almost 4% in early Asia trade as the tailwind continued from the company\u2019s partial victory last week in the lawsuit brought by the U.S. securities regulator.\n\nBitcoin, Ether retreat\n\nBitcoin fell below the US$30,000 line that has offered floor support since late June and lost 2.46% for the week, according to data from CryptoMarketCap.

The price action could reflect investors\u2019 concerns that ongoing regulatory developments and macroeconomic headwinds could drive Bitcoin below the $29,000 level, which was last observed on June 21.\n\nOn the derivatives side, Bitcoin futures show increased demand, but Asian markets are slowing down.\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures typically trade at a slight premium compared to spot markets, reflecting sellers\u2019 willingness to receive more money in exchange for delaying settlement. Healthy markets generally exhibit BTC futures contracts trading at a 5% to 10% annualized premium, a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nBetween July 14 and July 17, BTC futures maintained a neutral-to-bullish 7% premium, surpassing the 5% threshold. This suggests moderate conviction among bulls following the unsuccessful attempt to break above $31,800.\n\nHowever, the Tether (USDT) premium in Asia has been declining. The stablecoin premium serves as an indicator of demand from China-based retail crypto traders, measuring the difference between peer-to-peer trades and the U.S. dollar.\n\nTether (USDT) peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nThe Tether premium in Asia recently reached a discount of 1.8%, marking its lowest point in over six months. This inverse premium trend started on July 12 and has continued to widen, indicating moderate sell pressure.\n\nRegulatory worries continue to plague crypto\n\nRegulation of the crypto sector is also still on investors\u2019 minds. Even though the July 13 ruling that the sale of XRP (XRP) via exchanges and over-the-counter desks did not violate securities regulations did boost markets, the court\u2019s decision did not definitively determine whether XRP\u2019s initial coin offering was classified as a security offering. This lack of clarity has left some investors uneasy, as it raises the possibility of other cryptocurrencies also facing potential securities designations.\n\nIn addition to the court\u2019s ruling on XRP, Binance also announced the layoff of 1,000 employees. Although the exchange has refuted the reports and claimed routine resource reallocation and ongoing hiring, concerns have arisen regarding Binance\u2019s future following the departure of several key executives and the ongoing court action from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nRelated: SEC vs Ripple referred to judge who ordered release of \u2018Hinman Documents\u2019\n\nMacroeconomic trends do not favor crypto\n\nThe macroeconomic environment has not been favorable for Bitcoin and risk-on assets. China\u2019s gross domestic product growth slowed to 6.3% in the second quarter, falling short of market expectations, with factors such as the ongoing trade war with the United States and the government\u2019s efforts to address debt contributing to the slowdown.\n\nConsidering the external factors and pending court decisions that could negatively impact the two largest exchanges, the odds of Bitcoin breaking below $29,000 have increased. This creates a favorable scenario for bears, causing the $30,000 resistance to gain strength.\n\nBitcoin's price could dip under $29,000 this week\n\nThere appears to be no specific catalyst restricting Bitcoin\u2019s upside potential, aside from worsening macroeconomic conditions and indications of further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve in 2023.\n\nFrom a trading perspective, BTC futures show higher confidence among professional traders using leverage. However, the sell pressure from retail investors in Asia limits the overall upside for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC skyrockets amidst lawsuit against the SEC\n\nLeveraged ETFs are \u201can even riskier investment product,\u201d says Grayscale\n\nThe crypto world has been rocked by two major announcements over the last few days. First, Ripple managed to partially win its case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 decision that XRP should not be considered a security, so long as it was being sold on crypto exchanges rather than directly to investors.\n\nThe second notable headline was regarding the SEC adding BlackRock\u2019s exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to its official docket as part of its proposed rule change process. Should the application get the SEC\u2019s approval, BlackRock will be the first to initiate its spot ETF, opening the door for more applications to be approved in the future.\n\nDigital asset management company Grayscale is in litigation against the SEC as the regulating body refuses to allow Grayscale to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot ETF.\n\nWe\u2019ve filed a lawsuit against the SEC. $GBTC \u2014 Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) June 30, 2022\n\nThe news about Ripple helped trigger a surge in GBTC activity.\n\nGrayscale Vs The SEC\n\nGrayscale filed its lawsuit against the SEC on June 30th. The digital asset manager sued the regulating body for rejecting its request to convert its GBTC to a spot ETF, while approving leveraged ETFs.\n\nThe filing said: \u201cThe fact that the Commission has allowed a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP to begin trading demonstrates that the Commission continues to arbitrarily treat spot bitcoin ETPs differently than bitcoin futures ETPs.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cWhile the Commission could theoretically correct its discriminatory treatment of spot bitcoin ETPs by rescinding its approval of all bitcoin-based ETPs, the Commission\u2019s apparent willingness to permit even a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP\u2014a particularly high-risk version of a bitcoin futures product\u2014makes clear that theCommission has no intention of doing so. Thus, the only way to eliminate the Commission\u2019s unequal treatment of bitcoin-based ETPs is to allow proposed spot bitcoin ETPs like Grayscale\u2019s to begin trading.\u201d\n\nJames Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, even cast his prediction regarding the lawsuit\u2019s timeline.\n\nGonna retweet this because Grayscale has already filed their APA lawsuit for the $GBTC denial. Here is our *estimated* timeline of events courtesy of @NYCStein . But things are moving fast. https://t.co/ql8a43W5vs \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2022\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Revived Hope\n\nIn the meantime, financial institutions, including the world\u2019s biggest asset management firm, BlackRock, have been continuously applying for spot ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s application has finally been added to the SEC\u2019s official docket for review.\n\nWhile that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that BlackRock\u2019s application is about to be accepted, it points towards a positive future for spot ETF applications.\n\nIn light of the news, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC daily volumes see a spike that signals its highest level in 2023.\n\nStatistics show that Grayscale\u2019s largest fund product topped $183 million on July 13. The company\u2019s second best score was on June 30th, when it topped $170.\n\nWhether the asset manager will finally have their wish of attaining a spot ETF is yet to be seen. However, the SEC is currently under heavy scrutiny by both legislators and private companies."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped below the $30,000 level on July 18, which retail investors may not have expected given the developments of the last month, but does the downside move represent an upcoming shift in the trend?\n\nData suggests that over the longer term, it does not.\n\nTo get to the positives first, Bitcoin price is still attempting to flip the $30,000 level to support after about 10 attempts since April of this year, but price is continuously finding buyers in the $28,000 to $25,000 range, which buyers seem to be viewing as an accumulation zone.\n\nOn-chain data from Glassnode\u2019s Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score supports this sentiment and could be a positive, depending on how investors\u2019 look at things given that the behavior of investors at $30,000 BTC price mirrors the same accumulation behavior seen in the $28,000 to $24,000 zone and the near the supposed $16,800 bottom.\n\nBitcoin Accumulation Trend Score. Source: Glassnode\n\nAccording to Glassnode, \u201can Accumulation Trend Score of closer to 1 indicates that on aggregate, larger entities (or a big part of the network) are accumulating, and a value closer to 0 indicates they are distributing or not accumulating.\u201d\n\nBasically, buyers strongly accumulated from November to December and they were heavy accumulators from March to April when BTC recaptured $30,000. The metric suggests they are doing the same in July as BTC attempts to either conquer the $30,000 resistance or received a boost from all the ETF and XRP SEC news.\n\nBitcoin is in a crab market\n\nThe current price action and derivatives market data suggest that Bitcoin is in a crab market, where price remains range bound and consolidates for a prolonged period of time. As JLabs analyst JJ the Janitor pointed out last week, a strong push through the $32,000 level would catalyze a CME gap fill from the Luna Terra-crash era.\n\nBitcoin CME Futures showcasing Luna crash CME Gap. Source: JJ The Janitor\n\nFrom the perspective of Bitcoin\u2019s weekly market structure, the $30,000 level is an important pivot point that has functioned as support in the previous bull market cycle (and now as resistance) but a grab above that level would essentially set a higher high on the longer time frame and be confirmation of a trend reversal where the next point of resistance is around the $37,000 level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTraders\u2019 activity in the derivatives market is another factor contributing to the current crab market. Funding is down, open interest is relatively muted and besides retail plebs who are attempting to long breakouts and long lower support retests, or short breakouts and getting liquidated in both instances, a meaningful surge in these metrics that would inspire confidence that price is on the verge of some massive breakout has yet to emerge.\n\nBTC/USDT derivatives data, daily chart. Source: JJ The Janitor\n\nSure, DXY took a dip below 100 last week, but it\u2019s possibly more connected to investors reacting to the Fed\u2019s positive steps on inflation and too tight of a timeframe to expect some massive reaction from BTC immediately.\n\nThe price action in crypto exchange futures highlights degen longs and shorts trying to get ahead of price breakouts and that they are not having much success in the short term.\n\nJJ the Janitor suggests that a metric to watch is aggregate open interest, if that breaks down sharply from the current range then some true buy the dip opportunities could emerge. Currently, it\u2019s still in an uptrend, albeit sideways, but seeing a surge in OI could also be interesting and likely news, regulatory or legislative event driven.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price falls under $30K as macro and regulatory worries take center stage\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s short-term price action might raise some concern among newer investors and day-traders, the on-chain perspective remains quite compelling.\n\nThe #Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply remains at an ATH of 14.5M BTC. This suggests mature investors are preferring to accumulate Bitcoin, rather than distribute. pic.twitter.com/VkY9uTAVGG \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) July 18, 2023\n\nAt the same time, the Total Balance in Accumulation Addresses metric has also resumed its uptrend since March 16, when BTC price traded at $25,000.\n\nBitcoin Total Balance in Accumulation Addresses (BTC). Source: Glassnode\n\nReaders should also note that the metric also shows the total balance in accumulation addresses increasing since January 2022, when Bitcoin price was trading at $47,800 per coin. What is apparent is that through the worst of the crypto market collapse and Bitcoin price sell-off, multiple on-chain metrics show investors continuing to increase their allocation to BTC.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Jack Dorsey's Block is building a sci-fi style crypto wallet to keep Bitcoin safe. Here's how it works - Business Today",
        "content": "Block, the tech firm previously known as Square and led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, is developing Bitkey, a cutting-edge crypto key product. The company is expected to roll out the new hardware later this year.\n\nBitkey is a physical, hardware-based crypto key product that serves as a self-custody wallet. It's not your typical mobile app, but an actual piece of hardware that you can hold in your hand, and it's designed to put the keys to your digital assets squarely in your control.\n\nBitkey's business lead, Lindsey Grossman, in an exclusive interaction with Business Today says a team of engineers, designers and product managers have been working on the product for many months. \"The Bitkey Beta program is the result of months of hard work and dedication from our team and the thoughtful feedback we\u2019ve received from others in the industry as well as prospective customers,\" Grossman said.\n\n\"Our aim is to create a product that empowers customers to take control of their bitcoin in a secure, user-friendly way,\" she adds. Grossman noted that Block's CEO, Jack Dorsey, is also deeply supportive of the Bitkey project. His enthusiasm stems from the product's potential to put customers in control of their money as well as the program\u2019s approach to developing in the open.\n\nGrossman also showed the product to this writer over a video call. With its sleek, futuristic design, Bitkey seems like a gadget straight out of a sci-fi film. It's designed to be more than just a novelty, though. It has the potential to serve a critical purpose in the world of cryptocurrencies by bringing ownership transparency and self-custody amid increasing regulatory oversight worldwide.\n\nUsers can purchase Bitcoin on a crypto exchange and then transfer it to their Bitkey wallet. Any transaction or transfer from Bitkey beyond a set limit the customer sets must be approved by the Bitkey device.\n\nThe user can transfer any amount to Bitkey and for money sent from the wallet, they can create a rule that any transaction above any amount they choose (let\u2019s say $20) cannot be transferred out of the wallet unless the user also approves it by signing with the hardware and then tapping to the mobile phone. In this example, let\u2019s say the user\u2019s phone gets stolen and someone can access their mobile app.\n\nWith this spending limit in place, only $20 is at risk; all the other money the customer has protected behind the additional signing requirement of the hardware which they are recommended to keep safely tucked away separate from their mobile phone on a regular basis. It's a bit like two-factor authentication banks use in the case of mobile banking, under which transactions happen only after the code that account holders receive through email or SMS is entered.\n\nGrossman says self-custody wallets such as Bitkey put the keys in the user's hands and ensure self-custody of their money. She explains that exchange-hosted wallets hold the keys on users' behalf, so the user never really owns the keys. Citing the collapse of American crypto exchange FTX last year which resulted in many investors losing their money, Grossman claims a tool such as Bitkey can protect investors in similar scenarios.\n\n\"As we saw with the FTX disaster, when things go bust, you realise you don't truly own your own money. That's why we wanted to build something that puts the keys in the hands of customers and offers them self-custody,\" Grossman explains.\n\nAlso Read: Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey mock Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Twitter-like 'Threads' over privacy concerns\n\nThe team at Block has been publicly releasing details of the product on their development blog. The minimalist design of Bitkey belies its functionality. With no screen interface on the hardware itself, Bitkey's exterior is sleek and uncluttered. The only interactive element on the device is a fingerprint sensor. For executing a transaction when the amount surpasses the user-determined spending limits, the user simply initiates a command on the mobile app and then confirms the transaction by touching the fingerprint sensor on the device and tapping the device to the mobile phone via NFC.\n\nNFC, which stands for near-field communication, allows two devices to talk to each other when they are close together. The product is what the team at Block calls a 'two out of three multi-signature Bitcoin wallet'.\n\nGrossman explains: \"We call it a two out of three multi-signature Bitcoin wallet, where there's three keys. One key is on your mobile phone, which you access via the mobile app. The second key is on the hardware device (Bitkey). And the third and final key is on Block's server. In this multi signature design, two keys are always needed to move money. The customer has two keys in their hands (mobile app and Bitkey), and Block has one on back end.\"\n\nGrossman underscores that with Block holding only one key, it can never independently facilitate the movement of money, further reinforcing the product's commitment to the principle of self-custody.\n\nWhile Grossman refused to share the possible price of the product, Block has been making strides in ensuring that there are takers for the device when it gets launched later this year. Apart from making it available to interested users of the Cash App (Block's subsidiary), Block has also signed a deal with Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nAccording to the company, the 'transfer' and 'buy+transfer' features with both partners will see a staggered rollout since the product is in a beta phase. But, once live, the company says customers will be able to buy bitcoin with their choice of exchange partners and immediately transfer their bitcoin to self-custody with Bitkey.\n\nAlso Read: \u2018We\u2019ll shut you down, raid homes': Twitter ex-CEO Jack Dorsey claims 'pressure' from Indian govt during farmers' protest\n\nAlso Read: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sent a Threads follow request to Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.

        "content": "The long-awaited recession and resulting resumption of the 2022 bear market that many have been expecting have failed to materialize so far in 2023. In fact, most assets have caught a bid, with the Nasdaq hitting a 52-week high on July 12.\n\nHow can this be, and will the rally continue?\n\nMichael Burry of The Big Short fame declared in January that the United States could be in recession by late 2023, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) lower and the Federal Reserve cutting rates (note that last week's CPI print came in much lower than expected, further fueling the recent rally). This would lead to another inflation spike, in his view.\n\nRecently, independent macro and crypto analyst Lyn Alden explored the topic in a newsletter published this month.\n\nIn the report, Alden examines today\u2019s inflationary environment by contrasting it to two similar but different periods: the 1940s and the 1970s. From this, she concludes that the U.S. economy will likely stall or experience a mild recession while experiencing some level of persistent inflation. This could mean that markets continue trending upward until an official recession hits.\n\nMy July 2023 newsletter is out:https://t.co/gTH0nUyrU8\n\n\n\nThe topic focus on fiscal dominance, and how large debts and deficits can mute the impact of higher interest rates as a policy tool. pic.twitter.com/qmuzInyYjK \u2014 Lyn Alden (@LynAldenContact) July 2, 2023\n\nThe Fed\u2019s inflation fight continues\n\nThe important difference between the two periods involves rapid bank lending and large monetized fiscal deficits, which Alden suggests are the underlying factors driving inflation. The former occurred in the 1970s as baby boomers began buying houses, while the latter occurred during World War II as a result of funding the war effort.\n\nThe 2020s are more like the 1940s than the 1970s, yet the Fed is running the 1970s monetary policy playbook. This could turn out to be quite counterproductive. As Alden explains:\n\n\u201cSo as the Federal Reserve raises rates, federal interest expense increases, and the federal deficit widens ironically at a time when deficits were the primary cause of inflation in the first place. It risks being akin to trying to put out a kitchen grease fire with water, which makes intuitive sense but doesn\u2019t work as expected.\u201d\n\nIn other words, today\u2019s inflation has been primarily driven by the creation of new federal debt, or what some may call government money printing.\n\nRaising interest rates to calm inflation can work, but it\u2019s meant for inflation that has its roots in an expansion of credit tied to banking loans. While higher rates tame such inflation by making borrowing more expensive and thus reducing loan creation in the private sector, they make fiscal deficits worse by increasing the amount of interest owed on those debts. The federal debt today is over 100% of gross domestic product (GDP), compared to just 30% in the 1970s.\n\nFederal government interest payment expenditures versus federal funds effective rate. Source: FRED\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve has cooled some parts of the economy by raising rates by 500 basis points in little more than a year, the underlying cause of the current inflationary environment remains unaddressed. And with a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio than the U.S. had 50 years ago, the situation will only worsen at a faster pace.

While bonds have sold off again, raising yields to near 2022 highs, risk assets like tech stocks have been soaring.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this rally has primarily been led by just seven stocks, including names like Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and Google. These equities make up a disproportionate weight of the Nasdaq:\n\nJust seven stocks make up 55% of the NASDAQ 100 and 27% of the S&P 500\n\n\n\nThe distribution has become so lopsided that the NASDAQ will be rebalancing to give these megacaps less weight.\n\n\n\nSource: @GoldmanSachs pic.twitter.com/k1xM1wmL2S \u2014 Markets & Mayhem (@Mayhem4Markets) July 13, 2023\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining stocks outperform BTC in 2023, but on-chain data points to a potential stall\n\nBonds down, crypto and tech up\n\nThe rally in tech due in large part to artificial intelligence-driven hype and a handful of mega-cap stocks has also caught a tailwind from an easing in bond market liquidity.\n\nAlden notes how this began late last year:\n\n\u201cBut then some things began to change at the start of Q4 2022. The U.S. Treasury began dumping liquidity back into the market and offsetting the Fed\u2019s quantitative tightening, and the dollar index declined. The S&P 500 found a bottom and began stabilizing. The liquidity in sovereign bond markets began easing. Various liquidity-driven assets like bitcoin turned back up.\u201d\n\nA July 11 report from Pantera Capital makes similar observations, noting that real interest rates also have a very different story to tell when compared to the 1970s.\n\n\u201cThe traditional markets may struggle \u2014 and blockchain might be a safe haven,\u201d in part because \u201c[t]he Fed needs to continue to raise rates,\u201d given that real rates remain at negative 0.35%, according to the report. The report also concludes from this, \u201cThere\u2019s still tons of risk in bonds.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to note that while most other asset classes are sensitive to interest rates, crypto is not. Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to equities during 2022 was driven by the collapse of \u201cover-leveraged centralized entities.\u201d Today, that correlation has reached near-zero levels:\n\nBitcoin correlation with S&P 500.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin miners will face headwinds as the hash rate reaches new record highs ahead of the upcoming halving event next spring, with volatile electricity costs and competition among miners pushing up the cost of production, according to analysts at global financial giant JP Morgan.\n\nHash rate refers to the computational power used to mine a cryptocurrency. The halving event, which occurs roughly every four years, will reduce miners' rewards by half.\n\n\"The upcoming bitcoin halving event in April/May 2024 could be a stress test for Bitcoin miners,\" writes JP Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and colleagues in the firm's latest Flows and Liquidity report, which the firm shared with Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"[It] would reduce the issuance rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, implying a reduction in miners\u2019 revenue, effectively increasing Bitcoin\u2019s production cost at the same time,\" the report explains. \"As a result, while Bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners.\"\n\nAccording to the analysis, and based on a global average cost of electricity of $0.05/kWh, it costs around $20,000 to mine a Bitcoin, which is currently worth around $30,000, per CoinGecko. But JP Morgan said the volatility of the hash rate points to the use of a variety of energy sources, meaning miners with access to lower-priced power have an advantage.\n\nIn fact, the company said, a one-cent increase in the cost per kilowatt hour translates to a $4,300 increase in the cost of Bitcoin production.\n\n\"Post halving this sensitivity would double to $8,600, thus increasing the vulnerability of higher-cost producers,\" the firm noted.\n\nThere has been some good news for miners, however.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Institutional interest in bitcoin mining has provided support to struggling miners, with investments in mining rigs from companies like Galaxy Digital and Grayscale Investments,\" it observed. Galaxy Digital recently acquired a major mining facility from Argo Blockchain, and Grayscale spun off an entity focused on Bitcoin mining hardware.\n\n\"Tether, the world largest stablecoin issuer, also plans an investment in a bitcoin mining site in El Salvador,\" according to the report.\n\nNonetheless, the price of Bitcoin and transaction fees will need to rise significantly to offset the lower block reward.\n\nJP Morgan also observed that \"the decline in hype surrounding cryptocurrencies poses an additional challenge for miners' revenues,\" including \"the decline in the hype around Ordinals.\"\n\nThe number of daily Ordinals inscriptions recently hit an all-time high, but Bitcoin fees did not sustain earlier highs along with them.\n\n\"Going forward, it seems unlikely that the Bitcoin hash rate will continue to rise at the same pace post the April/May 2024 halving event without any sustained rise in the Bitcoin price above its production cost or a large increase in transaction fees that could offset the reduction in issuance rewards,\" JP Morgan concluded."

        "content": "According to recent findings from blockchain analytics company IntoTheBlock, around 29% of the total Bitcoin circulating supply is now presumed lost forever after remaining stagnant for over five years.\n\nBitcoin was designed to be scarce, with only 21 million coins ever to be mined, but the very features that make the cryptocurrency so attractive to investors can sometimes lead to investors losing their assets forever, especially in cases where private keys are forgotten.\n\nRelated Reading: Why Ripple\u2019s Victory Against The SEC May Be Short-Lived: Legal Expert\n\nStagnant BTC Addresses Are Growing Over Time\n\nIn a recent tweet by IntoTheBlock, the company called attention to the high number of dormant bitcoin addresses. \u201cOur data shows that 29% of $BTC hasn\u2019t moved in over 5 years. It\u2019s possible that a large part of this concerns lost coins,\u201d the tweet said.\n\nBTC presumed lost crosses 7.7 million | Source: Glassnode\n\nSimilar data has been supplied by Glassnode Alerts, an on-chain metrics monitor. According to Glassnode, on-chain data shows that the total quantity of HODLed or lost bitcoins just hit a new all-time high of 7,781,224.168 BTC. Given that the price of a single Bitcoin is currently about $30,000, this equates to more than $235 billion in BTC that has now been lost.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For Bitcoin?\n\nInstitutional interest in Bitcoin has grown in the past year, with companies like MicroStrategy doubling down on their bitcoin holdings. Hence, the increase in dormant addresses can show more people are holding Bitcoin as a long-term investment rather than trading or spending it. However, it can also signal the amount of BTC lost forever, especially by early investors.\n\nBTC price trending at $30,100 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nTaking into account that early investors are more likely to cash out on the huge gains made by the price of bitcoin, the latter is more likely. The price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed over the years and small amounts of Bitcoin from the early days are now worth a fortune. So if investors still had access to these dormant BTC, then they would likely have been moved already.\n\nAs Bitcoin gained mainstream popularity, many people have also bought in without fully understanding how to secure their private keys properly. A good example is the case of Stefan Thomas, a San Francisco-based programmer who is unable to asses his holdings of about 7,002 bitcoins. Thomas\u2019 holdings are currently worth $216 million, but he can\u2019t remember the password containing the private keys to his digital wallet.\n\nWith bitcoin having a fixed supply, its increasing scarcity due to lost coins can also enhance its appeal as a store of value. This could drive the price up due to increasing demand for the fewer bitcoins in circulation.\n\nBitcoin has seen a surge in price in recent months fueled by spot ETF applications filed by major investment companies like BlackRock and Valkyrie. The cryptocurrency is up by 43% this year and is currently ranging around $30,000 for the past few weeks.\n\nFeatured image from Futurism, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

That\u2019s something BTC can do in one day alone.\n\nThe major crypto has been stagnant, to say the least, and was briefly buoyed by BlackRock\u2019s ETF (exchange-traded fund), a major move by the $10 trillion asset manager which pushed BTC over the $31,000 mark only to subside below the $30K level in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accepted BlackRock\u2019s ETF application a day after it acknowledged a similar application by Bitwise. Last Friday, the U.S. regulator said it would also review applications for various funds, including Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco Galaxy.\n\nRead: Why is Bitcoin pushing $30k?\n\nThis points to SEC\u2019s preparedness to look into creative crypto trades and bodes well for bullish Bitcoin proponents.\n\nA fund that mirrors the value of one or multiple digital tokens and comprises a variety of cryptocurrencies is known as a cryptocurrency ETF.\n\nPutting downward pressure on Bitcoin prices has been SEC\u2019s regulatory probe of Binance and Coinbase exchanges, but next Wednesday\u2019s U.S. inflation report for last June is also helping maintain a price status quo. Typically, a low inflation report is a good sign for crypto prices while a need to increase interest rates to battle inflation is the contrary.\n\nEconomists are forecasting the headline year-on-year CPI, a measure of the index for all items less food and energy, is likely to have cooled to 3.1 percent in June from May\u2019s 4 percent.\n\nCurrent appetite for Bitcoin\n\nCrypto analytics firm Glassnode revealed that a record amount of BTCs were traded near the current price, a buyer behavior that suggests significant demand for Bitcoin today.\n\n\u201cIn this calculation, we discard coin movements between addresses controlled by the same entity, as such transfers do not correspond to real purchasing events and would distort the actual mean purchasing price. Further, we exclude all supply that is on exchanges, because a single averaged price for the funds of millions of users would be misleading and give rise to unwanted artifacts in the data,\u201d Glassnode\u2019s explainer confirms.\n\nNearly 4 percent of the total BTC supply last moved at just over $30,000 more than when the crypto was priced at $16,500 in 2022, immediately post the FTX collapse.\n\nHalving rally\n\nBitcoin could see a major price boost at next year\u2019s Spring halving event.\n\nThe halving event occurs every four years and is part of helping BTCs become a store of value by limiting the mining (or printing) of coins, as no new bitcoins will be released after the 21-million coin limit is reached.\n\nThe event will reduce miners\u2019 rewards by half. Currently, rewards are 6.25 BTC per block ($187,000) and in April 2024 they will be reduced to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\nHalving has historically been seen as having a positive effect on the Bitcoin price.\n\nThis will happen at the expense of BTC miners. With less of an incentive to mine cryptos, there will be less supply on the market and this means more demand, helping inflate prices.\n\nBased on a global average cost of electricity of $0.05/kWh, it costs around $20,000 to mine a Bitcoin.\n\nFor more on technology, click here."

More details here \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/aIofPdtAGY \u2014 Binance (@binance) July 17, 2023\n\nDuring that time, the Bitcoin mempool, which holds pending transactions, had more than 420,000 unconfirmed transactions, surpassing even the levels observed during the bull run of 2021.\n\nThe network congestion resulted in a significant increase in average transaction fees for Bitcoin and was largely attributed to the emergence of the BRC-20 token standard created on the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol.\n\nOther major crypto exchanges that have integrated support for the Lightning Network include Kraken, OKX, and Bitfinex, as well the mobile payment platform Cash App.\n\nStory continues\n\nMultiple addresses\n\nIn a separate development, Binance today revealed it has launched a new feature enabling users to obtain multiple deposit addresses for a single network.\n\nInitially, users can generate multiple deposit addresses only for tokens issued on the Ethereum network (ERC-20) and Ethereum-compatible networks like Arbitrum One or BNB Chain, with more networks to be supported at a later stage.\n\nAccording to Binance, users may obtain up to 20 deposit addresses for each network. The exchange will periodically review this quota to decide if an increase or decrease on the number of deposit addresses is necessary.\n\nDecrypt has reached out to Binance for comment and will update this article should the exchange respond."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAn ESG focused-fund manager is challenging claims from the environmental non-profit GreenpeaceUSA that Bitcoin mining is a major source of pollution and societal harm.\n\nIn a report published last Tuesday, GreenpeaceUSA called on Bitcoin-friendly financial services companies\u2014including BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan, and others\u2014to denounce Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cclimate destruction\u201d and encourage a code change to a \u201ccleaner protocol\u201d that obviates the mining industry.\n\n\u201cAll of these companies have connections to Bitcoin and have failed to take meaningful action to solve the problem despite making climate and sustainability pledges,\u201d GreenpeaceUSA wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's a view rejected by CH4 Capital co-founder Daniel Batten, who argues that Bitcoin is a force for environmental healing, rather than harm.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing weight of evidence from those most qualified to make the assessment to suggest that Bitcoin mining helps build out the renewable grid,\u201d Batten wrote in a formal rebuttal to GreenpeaceUSA on Sunday. He cited Brad Jones, former interim CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), who has spoken about Bitcoin\u2019s ability to make renewable energy operators more profitable, fundable, and stable.\n\nAccording to Batten, many of the facts and figures used by GreenpeaceUSA to demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s environmental harm were misleading, if not outright false.\n\nGreenpeaceUSA \"uses unsubstantiated fear about 'what might happen' rather than evidence,\" he writes, saying the report is \"filled with emotive language.\"\n\nFor example, GreenpeaceUSA claimed that the mining industry is \u201cmostly powered mostly by coal.\u201d In fact, Batten notes, there are 41 known sustainably powered mining operations, and only one operation still uses a coal-related product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFurthermore, unlike the environmental activist group's claim that Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cclimate destruction\u201d would \u201caccelerate\u201d if left unchecked, Batten presented data showing that Bitcoin\u2019s emissions are actually falling over time.\n\n\u201cEmissions are falling despite rising hashrate due to decimation of mining in Kazakhstan and other coal-based grids,\u201d explained Batten in a message to Decrypt. Such miners, he said, have relocated to more sustainably powered grids like those in Texas.\n\nHe also cited individual public mining companies, such as Marathon, which have moved their facilities from a coal-based to wind-based standard, alongside \u201cflare-gas mining that reduces the overall net emissions of the bitcoin network.\u201d\n\nBatten\u2019s fund specifically invests in companies that aim to mine Bitcoin using purified landfill gas that would otherwise be burned and pollute the atmosphere with methane emissions. The process is a win-win for both the environment and the company\u2019s bottom line, he writes.\n\n\u201cOur $400 million fund will have sufficient dry powder to finance the Bitcoin network, abating more emissions than its creating, which can end ESG FUD, the major remaining barrier for both retail and institutional adoption,\u201d Batten told Decrypt.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been largely unwelcoming to GreenpeaceUSA\u2019s campaign, which began last year after the organization received $5 million to highlight the perils of the mining industry.\n\nWhen asked for his thoughts on the GreenpeaceUSA campaign and its backer, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, Batten refused to comment in great detail.\n\n\u201cI'll let people make up their own mind about the intentions of a chair of another altcoin giving a large sum of money to help an NGO attack a rival form of cryptocurrency in Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor's Note: This article was updated to correct Daniel Batten's name and clarify that he was responding to GreenpeaceUSA's Bitcoin mining report."

Discover SCENE\n\nSpot trading volumes on centralized crypto exchanges plummeted by 43% in the second quarter of 2022, new data from CoinGecko suggests.\n\nAnd Binance\u2014which has been slashing jobs as it retreats from key markets and faces civil charges in the U.S.\u2014was especially hard hit.\n\nCoinGecko's report covering Q2 indicates that the world's biggest exchange has seen its dominance slide from 62% to 51% in just three months\u2014a sign that Changpeng Zhao's constant cries of \"FUD\" aren't washing with crypto traders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe contraction in trading volumes, which was also seen on decentralized exchanges, comes despite a 7% uptick in Bitcoin's price throughout the quarter.\n\nBinance's woes also extended to the stablecoin markets, with BUSD losing 45.4% of its market cap between April and June after the embattled exchange made True USD (TUSD) its default stablecoin. The switch saw TUSD become the biggest gainer of the quarter after $1 billion was minted on the Tron network\u2014that's a 50% rise. Tether remains firmly at the top of the list, and concluded the quarter with a 66% share of the stablecoin market.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, things are also looking gloomy in the NFT sector, despite Bitcoin Ordinals reigniting interest in crypto collectibles. Bored Ape Yacht Club prices have recently sunk to a two-year low, down 88% from their peak in a torrid time for top-tier projects. Trading volumes among all NFTs fell 35% to $3.15 billion in Q2. And Solana\u2014which has been rocked by multiple outages in recent years\u2014saw demand crater by a jaw-dropping 79% as flagship collections migrated to Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nThere was better news for Ethereum, which has largely shrugged off the threat of Bitcoin Ordinals. CoinGecko's data says 83% of NFT trading occurred via its blockchain over the quarter\u2014but there is a chance this could start to erode as 2023 continues.\n\nAnd despite withdrawals of staked ETH being activated after a years-long wait, the total amount of Ethereum locked up by validators rallied by 30% in the second quarter\u2014hitting just shy of 24 million as a result. That's worth close to $45 billion at current market rates, and indicates crypto enthusiasts are keen to get involved in staking now there's certainty over retrieving locked-up funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "BTC Price Analysis: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price has fallen to the lower end of its almost one-month trading range between $29,800 and $31,300. Already yesterday, BTC briefly fell to as low as $29,704, only to recover to $30,306 within a few hours. At press time, BTC was again moving towards the $30,000 mark, and another fall and liquidity grab seems likely.\n\nWhile this week the macro data releases are pretty quiet, it\u2019s worth taking a look at what\u2019s happening in the Bitcoin market itself.\n\nWhy Is Bitcoin Down Today?\n\nSwissblock Insights observed a peculiar calm in the market when Bitcoin reached a new yearly high of $31.840 last week. However, the momentum quickly faded, and selling pressure increased, causing BTC to drop to the low $30ks. They highlight the narrow Bollinger Bands, stating, \u201cThe Bollinger Bands are very narrow, with only a 4.2% value difference separating the upper and lower bands. A move is brewing.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the analysts emphasize the need for a significant catalyst to inject life into the current lackluster scenario:\n\nVolatility is expected to appear on the scene, although, in the short term, we are in no man\u2019s land; liquidity remains low, open interest is still flat and shorts are nowhere to be seen. There\u2019s no command in the direction we are going, and only a significant catalyst can spice things up in this dull scenario we are in.\n\nAccording to the analysts, a breakdown of the $29.650 support level would invalidate a long setup. On the other hand, a bullish leg up $31.500 could reignite momentum and surge the price to $33,000. But for this to happen, spot demand needs to reignite strongly and longs need to enter the market, \u201cotherwise momentum will continue to fading.\u201d\n\nGlassnode, an on-chain data provider, further illuminates the current state of the Bitcoin market. Despite the temporary yearly high, they describe the market as \u201cextremely quiet\u201d, also pointing to the Bollinger Bands. This compression in volatility signals a market reminiscent of the calm observed in early January, as NewsBTC reported yesterday.\n\nFurthermore, Glassnode\u2019s analysis reveals a slow but steady inflow of capital into Bitcoin. The Realized Cap currently sits just shy at $396 billion. After hitting a cycle low at $380 billion, the metric indicates that a slow but steady stream of capital is entering the market throughout 2023.\n\nGlasnode also emphasizes that investors remain unwilling to part with their held supply, resulting in choppy market conditions similar to those seen in 2016 and 2019-20 periods. Total realized profit and loss resembles the historic trend:\n\nIf we take a ratio between total realized profit and loss, [\u2026] we can also note that a lower high in this ratio was set this week. If sustained, it may allude to similar choppy market conditions seen in both 2019-20, and again in the second half of 2021.\n\nThe analysis also highlights the profit-locking behavior among Bitcoin holders, with the majority of both short-term (88%) and long-term holders\u2019 balances (73%) held in profit. However, short-term holders are the primary entities that are active in the market.\n\nOut of the total 39.600 BTC in daily exchange inflows, 78% of this is associated with the STH cohort. This means that short term holders may have to trim their profits for the time being before selling pressure eases and the bulls can take the upper hand again.\n\nGreekLive, an options expert, explains that the Bitcoin market is still losing liquidity, which makes it highly susceptible to spikes and V-shaped recoveries:\n\nCryptocurrencies encountered a V-shaped market today, with BTC falling below $29,700 and ETH below $1,875, before rebounding in a V-shaped during Asian trading hours to regain the round number of points, but the options market barely reacted to this.\n\nThe analysis advises sellers to focus on static protection and have risk control plans for holding options until expiration. For buyers, timely profit-taking and using futures to hedge options are recommended risk management strategies.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $30,064.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nIn a matter of months, the world of Bitcoin and digital currencies will be experiencing another historic event \u2013 the fourth Bitcoin Halving expected in April 2024. This moment of anticipation and speculation serves as a high-stakes litmus test for both Bitcoin miners and the crypto market.\n\nIt is an event that has previously catalyzed monumental market shifts and could do so again.\n\nJUST IN \u2013 We're now 80% through to the next #Bitcoin halving. HODL ON \u270a pic.twitter.com/OIeEmVLYBt \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 14, 2023\n\nBitcoin halving is a unique feature of Bitcoin\u2019s supply algorithm, where the rewards for miners are halved every 210,000 blocks of transactions \u2013 an occurrence approximately every four years. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, linked the BTC\u2019s creation to its anti-counterfeiting mechanism \u2013 the complex computational mining process that validates transactions on the blockchain.\n\nInitially, a block\u2019s mining reward was 50 BTC; by 2024, this reward is slated to be 3.125 BTC.\n\nThe question facing us now is how this halving will impact Bitcoin and the overall crypto landscape. Historically, halvings have been associated with skyrocketing price movements. The halvings in 2012 and 2016 sparked bull runs, with BTC valuations soaring by about 8,000% and 1,000%, respectively. More recently, the 2020 halving unleashed a run that peaked with a record Bitcoin price of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nHowever, numerous factors contribute to the market\u2019s complex dynamics. Bitcoin\u2019s price movements have often coincided with other significant events, such as broader mainstream recognition, the proliferation of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and technological advancements.\n\nThe economic climate presents a potential dampener to the halving hype, with reduced expectations of U.S. Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts and stringent regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies around the world. Predicting a halving-induced bull run is far from a secure bet. As skepticism surrounding the halving\u2019s impact gains traction, other factors including macroeconomic trends and regulatory frameworks could take precedence over shaping Bitcoin\u2019s price than the halving.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin miners \u2013 those who actually provide the industry with new BTC \u2013 are faced with a troubling reality. Bitcoin mining, already an operation demanding substantial resources, will become even more challenging with the dwindling rewards. A Bloomberg report interviewed Jaran Mellerud, a crypto-mining analyst at Hashrate Index, who predicted:\n\n\u201cNearly half of the miners will suffer given they have less efficient mining operations with higher costs.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of miners could see an increase of $.08 k/h, which could signal a potential consolidation or even an exodus within the mining industry, Mellerud predicted.\n\nWolfie Zhao, head of research of Blockbridge, told Bloomberg that currently, public mining companies pay $10,000-$15,000 per mined Bitcoin. However, estimates suggest that mining BTC will cost between $20,000-$30,000:\n\nFor the average Bitcoin holder, however, the halving\u2019s impact will be mostly indirect. The event itself won\u2019t change the amount of BTC in their holdings, but its potential effect on price will be the most significant.\n\nIt could also very well serve as a springboard for another cyclical bull run or bring in a period of turbulence and consolidation. While the answer remains unclear, one thing is certain: the coming months will be a defining period for Bitcoin, its miners and the global cryptocurrency ecosystem."

        "content": "Investigation Reveals Bitcoin\u2019s Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Could Be a Group, Not an Individual\n\nSource: Adobe/Mihail\n\nThe identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin (BTC), has been a subject of intense curiosity and speculation since the advent of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile many envision a single genius behind its inception, there is growing evidence to suggest that Nakamoto may actually be a collective entity.\n\nIn its latest installment of the \u201cMany Facts\u201d Satoshi series, which presents various pieces of evidence pointing to the potential identities of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin.com News suggested that the mastermind behind Bitcoin\u2019s creation is a group rather than an individual.\n\nThe media claimed there is compelling evidence pointing out that Nakamoto may be a collective.\n\nOne piece of evidence is the usage of both \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cI\u201d in the Bitcoin white paper, indicating the possibility of a team operating under a singular pseudonym.\n\n\u201cWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network,\u201d Nakamoto says in the whitepaper.\n\n\u201cWe define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures,\u201d the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin says in another place.\n\nAnother piece of evidence comes from the linguistic analysis of Nakamoto\u2019s writings.\n\nThe white paper showcases impeccable English with precise language and accurate usage of technical terms. But since Nakamoto\u2019s writing style appears to be different in forums and email correspondences, this suggests multiple individuals were involved.\n\nA linguistic analysis of Nakamoto\u2019s forum posts revealed varying writing styles, further supporting the theory of a collective behind the pseudonym, the report said.\n\nNakamoto\u2019s Timestamps on Messages Support He Was a Collective Entity\n\nThe timestamps on Nakamoto\u2019s messages also hint at the involvement of multiple individuals.\n\nThere are theories regarding Nakamoto\u2019s location, with some suggesting that the Bitcoin mastermind lived in the UK while others found that he resided in California.\n\nA review titled \u201cThe Time Zones of Satoshi Nakamoto\u201d analyzed Nakamoto\u2019s hourly activity and concluded that Nakamoto likely resided in the EST time zone.\n\nIf Nakamoto is indeed a group, it would explain the possibility of multiple time zones being involved.\n\nThe breadth of knowledge displayed by Nakamoto is another indicator that he may be a collective.\n\nThe creator demonstrates proficiency in computer science, mathematics, flawless English, game theory, and the successful concealment of his identity for over a decade.\n\nIt raises doubts as to how a single individual could possess such a diverse skill set while remaining anonymous.\n\nDespite these compelling theories and details, there is no concrete evidence to confirm that Nakamoto is a group.\n\nNevertheless, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto continues to remain unknown, making the saga of Bitcoin\u2019s creator continues to be one of the most intriguing mysteries in the world of cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Craig Wright: Demonstrating that Bitcoin works is the best way to educate people about blockchain\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nHow do you educate people about the power of blockchain technology? According to Dr. Craig Wright, the best way to demonstrate its capabilities is by building solutions for the challenges they face in their day-to-day lives.\n\nDr. Wright was a keynote speaker at the London Blockchain Conference, where he talked about building a business with Bitcoin, redactable signature systems, and addressed the audience\u2019s questions. CoinGeek Backstage reporter Jon Southurst caught up with him on the sidelines of the event to talk about taking Bitcoin mainstream.\n\nOn the best way to bring in the masses, Dr. Wright says we must show the world what Bitcoin is capable of.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to demonstrate. [We must] build solutions and show them,\u201d he told CoinGeek Backstage.\n\nDr. Wright said private blockchains like the Hyperledger Fabric make big scalability claims that the public can\u2019t prove.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it public so that the whole world can view, audit and know,\u201d he says.\n\nThe nChain chief scientist lauded the growth of the blockchain industry in recent years. However, he believes that fragmentation is costing the sector.\n\n\u201cThe whole\u2019 everyone having their blockchain\u2019 thing is a bit silly. It\u2019s like everyone having their own internet,\u201d he notes.\n\nIn the internet\u2019s early days, most major enterprises were keen on having a private internet network that they could control. These networks would connect through protocol gateways. This approach wasn\u2019t scalable, and today, we all use one internet protocol, which has been the foundation of its success.\n\nSimilarly, blockchain technology will only become ubiquitous, like the internet, when the world uses one network that can scale to accommodate billions of users.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin blockchain can underpin virtually any industry, Dr. Wright believes it needs a few killer applications to put it on the global map. CBDCs are a great starting point, he told CoinGeek Backstage.\n\n\u201cImagine a digital pound where you can send a hundredth of a penny. That may not seem like a lot, but when you do lots of them, it will change the nature of many industries,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch: Blockchain enhances business efficiency and cost reduction\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "How to Mine Bitcoin from Your Smartphone? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Learn ways to mine crypto in July 2023 on your smartphone\n\nA mining app is the only method to utilize your smartphone to start mining Bitcoin. These mining applications enroll you in mining pools or teams of other miners who employ the hardware in your smartphone to produce a certain amount of hashrate while mining cryptocurrencies. You\u2019ll eventually produce enough Bitcoin to exchange it for fiat money profitably.\n\nApps for crypto mining were previously prohibited in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The major cause of this is that they place a ton of strain on the processors in your phone, which can cause battery loss, battery bloating, overheating, and latency problems. The first important thing you need to know is that you cannot download (legal) mining programs from the app store on your smartphone. We will go into more depth about this later. You must ask a friend to share a crypto mining program with you because downloading them online is incredibly hazardous. All you have to do to begin mining the cryptocurrency you choose is sign into the app after downloading it, look for a mining pool to join, and join. Even though it may take a while, you will eventually obtain a significant quantity of your preferred cryptocurrency, which you can then exchange for actual money via the app.\n\nDespite the dangers, mining can still be a practical alternative for a smartphone, especially given that many applications offer users the choice of using mine to purchase a \u201cpremium\u201d membership that eliminates all adverts. According to a recent survey, many consumers are eager to enable crypto-mining to substitute advertisements in exchange for advantages like a better user experience. Additionally, mining may be profitable for old devices that no longer contain your data. The most effective app for mining cryptocurrency on a smartphone is MinerGate.\n\nOne of the top mobile applications for mining cryptocurrencies is MinerGate. The program is extremely safe, has a ton of functionality, and gives miners access to statistics. On the app, you can customize your Bitcoin mining settings, such as the low usage mode, which lowers your total hashrate while maintaining most of your device\u2019s performance. MinerGate is used by over 5 million miners, demonstrating its widespread use. To guarantee you maximize your income, MinerGate also offers a 99.7% uptime rate. The app\u2019s sole flaw is forcing you into the built-in mining pools rather than letting you join pools for a particular coin you choose.\n\nCryptocurrency storage is necessary in addition to mining it if you want to keep it for the long run. My top-ranked cryptocurrency exchanges, ZenGo and Revolut, which include bank-level security technologies, are where you should store your cryptocurrency if you want to keep it secure. Although neither is our preferred cryptocurrency exchange, they include an integrated wallet, which VirgoCX does not. Exchanges like Newton, Bitbuy, and CoinSmart are also highly regarded. ZenGo is free to use, so you receive the finest security available without spending any money. Additionally, ZenGo offers free crypto sending and receiving, and its round-the-clock support staff often responds to questions within five minutes.\n\nYour crypto is safeguarded by two separately developed mathematical secret shares, one stored on your phone and the other in the cloud, thanks to ZenGo\u2019s exclusive keyless technology. Because of this innovative structure, your money will always be completely safe and easy to access, even if your phone is lost, stolen, or damaged or if ZenGo (the firm) were to commit fraud, declare bankruptcy, or otherwise discontinue operations.\n\nZenGo supports over 75 crypto assets, and creating a free account takes just a few seconds. Overall, ZenGo is the next iteration of crypto; it combines the best of both worlds with the highest level of security inside a user-friendly interface.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is steadily establishing itself as the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin (BTC) mining location. The UAE\u2019s partnership with major mining firms and the digital assets of Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund have made it an emerging crypto-mining hub. Its partnership with different Bitcoin mining companies has further contributed to its appeal for Bitcoin mining. Furthermore, the UAE has 400 megawatts of Bitcoin mining capacity, which has been predicted to surpass 600 megawatts by the end of the year. Additionally, its abundance of energy resources makes it a suitable environment for Bitcoin mining.\n\nMeanwhile, the world is also looking at Artificial Intelligence (AI), a disruptive technology, and InQubeta, the blockchain-based investment and fundraising platform for AI startups.\n\nIn this post, we will look into InQubeta and the specifics of its ecosystem and utility coin.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): The face of AI cryptocurrencies\n\nThe United Arab Emirates\u2019 (UAE) ambition to become a leading Bitcoin mining hub has not taken the spotlight away from artificial intelligence (AI) or InQubeta. AI is still a revolutionary technology, and InQubeta is benefiting from its soaring popularity and adoption as it offers an innovative solution to the sector.\n\nThe surging popularity of AI means InQubeta hasn\u2019t been left out of the spotlight thanks to its unique fundamentals. InQubeta aims to become the first platform where AI startups can raise funds for their projects. Similarly, it also intends to become an investment platform that will allow AI enthusiasts to invest early in promising AI projects.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s unique idea has been met with great enthusiasm, which has contributed to its overwhelming presale. As of press time, InQubeta has passed $1.4 million in presale, which is an incredible feat and a testament to its strong community.\n\nIt is the world\u2019s first AI crowdfunding platform, where AI startups will be able to raise funds through its NFT marketplace. They will achieve this by minting or tokenizing stakes in their startups and listing them as NFTs on the marketplace. Investors can then purchase these fractionalized NFTs and own stakes in promising AI businesses and projects. There will be no limits on AI investments, as investors will be able to invest any amount, which makes it more appealing and adoptable.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s low supply of 1.5 billion and its deflationary nature further increased its popularity within the crypto landscape. As a deflationary token, 2% of all token sales and 1% of purchases will be removed from circulation and burned.\n\nThe presale is currently in its second stage, with a price of $0.0098 per token. Analysts predict that the price will increase by 10 times before the end of the year.

This means that miners compete to append blocks and mine new Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining has become a popular practice in the crypto landscape as miners aim to get their hands on the scarce and valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nAs the leading cryptocurrency and most valuable, Bitcoin mining has become a lucrative practice, with many individuals and companies now mining the cryptocurrency. Although Bitcoin mining is global, the UAE is fast becoming a Bitcoin-mining hub as it creates a suitable environment for the practice.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis year has been an interesting one for both blockchain and AI technologies, which continue to soar in adoption and popularity. On the one hand, the UAE is gearing up to become a leading Bitcoin mining hub. On the other hand, AI and InQubeta have been soaring in popularity.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Show Limited Upside While InQubeta Projections show 500% Growth in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has long been dominated by heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have captured the attention of investors worldwide. While these cryptocurrencies have delivered impressive returns in the past, some experts believe that their exponential growth may be slowing down.\n\nHowever, amidst this scenario, a new contender is emerging with the potential to outpace Bitcoin and Ethereum: InQubeta and its native QUBE token. Here\u2019s why QUBE is generating excitement among investors and why it may offer a 5X return on investment in the near future.\n\nThe Limitations of Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have undoubtedly made significant strides in the world of digital currencies. Bitcoin, as the pioneer cryptocurrency, has enjoyed substantial growth and widespread adoption. Ethereum, on the other hand, has revolutionized the blockchain industry with its smart contract capabilities and the development of decentralized applications (DApps). However, as these cryptocurrencies mature, their growth potential may become more limited compared to newer projects.\n\nThe Rise of InQubeta (QUBE)\n\nInQubeta is a rising star in the crypto space and is capturing the attention of investors with its innovative approach and promising features. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have already experienced exponential growth, QUBE presents an opportunity for substantial gains in the near future. Its ongoing presale has been met with enthusiasm, raising expectations for its long-term potential.\n\nInvesting in QUBE\n\nSeveral factors contribute to QUBE\u2019s potential for significant growth. Firstly, its focus on the AI industry positions it at the forefront of the next technological frontier. As AI continues to expand its reach across industries, QUBE\u2019s integration of AI technology offers a unique value proposition for investors.\n\nFurthermore, QUBE\u2019s community-driven nature fosters active participation and engagement. Token holders have governance rights, allowing them to shape the project\u2019s future and direction. This decentralized approach not only strengthens the project\u2019s resilience but also instills a sense of ownership and involvement among investors.\n\nQUBE\u2019s Unique Value Proposition:\n\nQUBE brings several key features to the table that differentiate it from other cryptocurrencies. Its fractionalized NFT approach allows investors to own fractions of AI-driven assets, promoting inclusivity and increasing accessibility. By breaking down barriers to entry, QUBE enables a broader range of investors to participate in AI-driven projects and benefit from their potential growth.\n\nAdditionally, InQubeta leverages blockchain technology to enhance security and transparency. Through smart contract auditing and multi-layered verification processes, the platform ensures a secure environment for investors, mitigating the risks associated with traditional crowdfunding methods. This focus on security builds trust within the community and sets QUBE apart as a reliable investment opportunity. While Bitcoin and Ethereum may have already reached a level of maturity, QUBE presents an opportunity for exponential growth in the crypto market. Don\u2019t Miss Out On QUBE Presale\n\nInQubeta (QUBE) is currently in its presale which has raised over $1.4 million within a few weeks of launch. The presale has attracted both institutional and retail investors due to its low barrier of entry and multiple payment options. InQubeta has also revealed plans to launch a staking dapp for QUBE holders to stake their assets for rewards, an NFT marketplace and a unique DAO for decentralized governance.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum may continue to play essential roles in the crypto market, QUBE\u2019s innovative features and growth potential make it a compelling option for investors seeking exponential gains in the near future.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "US: news on Bitcoin linked to Silk Road - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "A few days ago, the Bitcoin wallet allegedly belonging to the US government\u2019s Justice Department moved several BTC linked to Silk Road.\n\nIndeed, on 12 July it appears there were two outgoing transactions, totaling more than 9,800 BTC, worth nearly $300 million at the current price.\n\nPreviously, on 7 March, there were two other outbound transactions totaling 49,000 BTC, amounting to as much as nearly $1.5 billion.\n\nIt is believed that this wallet not only belongs to the US government\u2019s Department of Justice, but also holds part of the Bitcoin seized from Silk Road.\n\nIt has actually only been active since March 2022, while Silk Road\u2019s closure dates back to 2013. However, incoming transactions related to the seizure of BTC linked to Silk Road date back to last year.\n\nAt this time the wallet appears to be empty, so the DOJ has transferred all the Bitcoin stored in it to other wallets. In total, over the months it had received nearly 50,000 BTC.\n\nThe possible sale of Bitcoin linked to Silk Road\n\nTypically, when authorities seize Bitcoin, they end up putting them up for auction.\n\nOver the years, the US government has already held several auctions during which it has sold BTC that it had previously seized, and it is therefore possible that the 9,800 BTC that was just transferred will also end up being auctioned.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that the total daily trading volume of BTC on the crypto markets is around $7.5 billion, so 300 million could have relatively little impact.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it has long been known that those BTC would end up in the auction sooner or later, so it is possible that the market has already priced in the news.\n\nFor now, there are no reports that any US government auctions for large Bitcoin sales have been officially announced.\n\nIn addition, it is possible that in order not to risk excessive price drops, and thus reduced proceeds, the government may decide to break up the sale into several auctions that could be held over a relatively long period of time, so as to give the market time to absorb these sales without large losses in value.\n\nFor example, the price of Bitcoin fell 0.8% after the news of the two transactions from that wallet, but it has already recovered its entire loss afterwards.\n\nIn contrast, the two transfers in March caused a much larger drop, but even that was later absorbed within three days.\n\nBitcoin auctions\n\nWhen the government decides to auction seized BTC, it organizes its sale in lots.\n\nNot all lots necessarily go to auction at the same time, and in fact it appears that as early as March some of the Bitcoin held in the above wallet were auctioned in lots totaling less than one-fifth of the total 50,000 BTC.\n\nHowever, that is not the only wallet that belongs to a US government agency, so the BTC actually auctioned off could be more.\n\nThese auctions are held fairly regularly, though not necessarily every year, because seizures of BTC are not as rare as is generally believed.\n\nHowever, the lots that are put up for sale are rarely small amounts, so the government generally waits until it has some in the till before auctioning them off in large lots.\n\nFor example, the sale held in March apparently yielded more than $200 million.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the sale price, for those who participate in these auctions, is often decidedly attractive, because no one would want to buy such large sums at market price.\n\nIn other words, the bids from potential buyers at these auctions often stop at below market prices, since there is no fixed price, so there are those who are able to take advantage of them to make good deals.\n\nSince they are held only when the US government, or some of its agencies or departments, decide to sell, and since the lots for sale have large amounts, there are not many buyers, and it is not even certain that right then they are willing to spend a lot to buy Bitcoin.\n\nAll this means that the sale price often turns out to be decidedly attractive.\n\nFor example, Tim Draper in 2014 participated in one such auction, and he was able to buy 30,000 BTC at a price just over $630. Three years later the price of BTC skyrocketed to $20,000.\n\nSince the US government\u2019s seized Bitcoin cost the US government nothing, auctions such as these often generate benefits for almost everyone except those whose BTC were seized."
