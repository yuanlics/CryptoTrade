Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nCrypto markets rose on Thursday, shrugging off a tougher regulatory stance from the U.S. government. Bitcoin gained 2.06% to $24,500.00 at around 4:04 p.m. ET while ether was up 1.21% at $1,679.31, according to Coin Metrics. There are \" increasing signs that the market bottomed last November and has turned bullish,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"We are gaining in momentum here and any bad news is being shrugged off, typical signs that the market believes the worst is over.\"\n\nCrypto markets were on edge earlier this week following increased regulatory scrutiny from U.S. authorities on digital currencies. On Monday, the New York State Department of Financial Services told Paxos to stop minting new Binance USD, or BUSD, stablecoins. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a real-world asset and some are backed by assets such as bonds or cash. BUSD is pegged one-to-one to the U.S. dollar. Paxos also confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has notified the company that the agency could recommend an action that alleges BUSD is a security. The SEC has not yet formally levelled any charges against Paxos.\n\nFlows into bitcoin"

        "content": "A similar issue was front and center on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, when the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing to discuss new safeguards for crypto investors, a possible first step toward legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s time now to consider how to protect consumers from unregulated digital assets, and ultimately, who we want our financial system to serve,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the committee chairman.\n\nOn Monday, New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos, a crypto firm, to cease creating BUSD, a so-called stablecoin, because of \u201cunresolved issues\u201d over its relationship with the crypto exchange Binance, which carried the coin\u2019s branding.\n\nLast week, the S.E.C. charged the crypto exchange Kraken with securities violations, arguing its \u201cstaking\u201d practice \u2014 in which users pledge crypto holdings to companies in exchange for hefty returns \u2014 was akin to selling an unregistered investment contract.\n\nAnd then there is the shadow of the spectacular implosion of FTX, which left investigators on a global hunt to recover billions in missing assets. Amid attempts to claw back funds to repay FTX\u2019s customers, attention has recently turned to $400 million that\u2019s sitting in an interest-bearing bank account.\n\nSo what\u2019s behind the Bitcoin rally? Some say that it\u2019s a so-called short squeeze, in which those who have bet against Bitcoin have to cover their positions by buying more. Another explanation is tax-loss harvesting, in which investors sell at a loss at the end of the year to reduce their tax hit, and then add to their holdings again when the calendar flips. A third potential factor: Crypto investors appear to be selling their holdings in so-called altcoins and putting that money into the relatively more established Bitcoin."

Well, BTC traded for about 6 cents at the time, and is around $22,000 now, so the relevance of this reading is a bit dubious in my opinion. What if we toss out all data before 2014? That gives a maximum NVT ratio of 98.52, which I think is more sensible. Bitcoin\u2019s lowest NVT on record was 0.22 on Jan. 24, 2016, when BTC was trading at $403. The average NVT over the time span studied was 24, which I also think has relevance."

        "content": "The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), is connecting more countries as the government of El Salvador is opening a \u201cBitcoin Embassy\u201d in the United States.\n\nEl Salvador, a country that adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, is expanding its Bitcoin strategy in a new partnership with the government of Texas. The intergovernmental collaboration aims to set up a Bitcoin Embassy, or El Salvador\u2019s representative office, in Texas to work on new joint projects to promote Bitcoin adoption.\n\nMilena Mayorga, the Salvadoran Ambassador to the United States, announced the news in a statement on Twitter on Feb. 14.\n\nTexas Deputy Secretary of State Joe Esparza and El Salvador\u2019s U.S. ambassador Milena Mayorga. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cIn my meeting with the assistant secretary of the government of Texas, Joe Esparza, we discussed the opening of the second Bitcoin Embassy and the expansion of commercial and economic exchange projects,\u201d Mayorga said.\n\nEl estado de Texas, nuestro nuevo aliado.\n\n\n\nEn mi encuentro con el Secretario Adjunto del Gobierno de Texas, Joe Esparza @TXsecofstate, abordamos la apertura de la segunda Embajada #Bitcoin y de ampliar los proyectos de intercambios comerciales y econ\u00f3micos. pic.twitter.com/NcmOjeadl6 \u2014 Milena Mayorga (@MilenaMayorga) February 14, 2023\n\nThe latest Bitcoin initiative comes a few months after El Salvador opened the first Bitcoin Embassy in Switzerland\u2019s southern city of Lugano in October 2022. As part of the efforts, the two pro-crypto jurisdictions started working to establish a physical governmental presence to promote cooperation in education and research institutions related to Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to former Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow, the phenomenon of the Bitcoin embassy is the next step in nation-states and cities adopting Bitcoin. He said that such initiatives imply cooperation between countries to develop new initiatives like establishing alliances between places that have adopted Bitcoin.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s \u2018limited\u2019 use of Bitcoin prevents forecasted risks, says IMF\n\nThe news comes amid Texas lawmakers reportedly considering a new bill calling for a \u201ca master plan for the expansion of the blockchain industry.\u201d The legal initiative aims to turn Texas into the crypto capital of the country by introducing tax-free shopping with Bitcoin, among other proposals.\n\nAs previously reported, Texas has emerged as one of the crypto-friendly U.S. states, passing crypto-friendly laws aiming to better adapt commercial laws to blockchain innovation and digital asset regulations. Texas is also home to some of the largest Bitcoin miners in North America, with major mining companies like Riot Blockchain, Core Scientific and Genesis Digital Assets operating in the state."

        "content": "Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz is dialing it back.\n\nIn January 2021, the founder and CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital said he would get a tattoo to commemorate Bitcoin reaching $500,000, which he expected to happen in 2024. On Wednesday, he said he\u2019d be happy if Bitcoin merely traded at $30,000 by the end of this year.\n\nNovogratz, an early investor in Bitcoin, made the comments at a Bank of America conference on Wednesday, as Bloomberg reported.\n\nBitcoin lost nearly 65% of its value over 2022, ending the year at about $16,500. It\u2019s up about 50% year to date to $24,792. But that\u2019s well below its peak of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the price action, when I look at the excitement of the customers calling, the FOMO [fear of missing out] building up, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we were at $30,000 by the end of the quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I would\u2019ve given both my shoes for that to be true just six weeks ago. Like if we end the year $30,000, I will be the happiest guy.\u201d\n\nAt a Bitcoin conference in Miami in April last year, Novogratz reiterated his prediction the cryptocurrency would hit $500,000, adding he also believed it would eventually reach $1 million. Bitcoin was then trading at around $44,300.\n\nHe said at the time that Bitcoin\u2019s price would soar once the Fed stepped back from raising interest rates.\n\nOn Wednesday, he predicted that the $500,000 mark would eventually be reached, but not in the next five years, and he again pointed to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s interest rate decisions.\n\n\u201cWhat makes me skeptical that we can have the explosive, back-to-the-old highs this year is Chairman Powell,\u201d Novogratz said. \u201cHe\u2019s really doing what he says he\u2019s going to do, and I don\u2019t see the Fed pivoting and cutting anytime soon.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only crypto investor remaining bullish on Bitcoin in the long term. Earlier this month, ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, long a Bitcoin believer, said that while 2022 was a \u201cterrible year for everything crypto,\u201d her firm predicts Bitcoin will hit \u201croughly $670,000\u201d in five years then could pass $1 million by 2030.\n\nOf course, many top business thinkers disagree with such predictions\u2014or discredit Bitcoin and other crypto entirely. Mark Mobius, the billionaire cofounder of Mobius Capital Partners, predicted in December that Bitcoin would fall to $10,000 at some point this year.\n\nAnd Warren Buffett\u2019s right-hand man Charlie Munger argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed this month that the U.S. should follow China\u2019s lead and pass laws that prevent both crypto trading and the formation of new cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn January last year, Novogratz tweeted a photo of a new tattoo on his shoulder. Reading \u201cLuna\u201d and showing a wolf howling at the moon, it indicated his enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency Luna, which later lost all its value after the wipeout of the so-called stablecoin TerraUSD, a sister token.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder that you are not always right,\u201d Novogratz said last summer.\n\nNote: \u201cBitcoin maximalist,\u201d used to describe Novogratz in an earlier version of this story, has been replaced with \u201cBitcoin bull.\u201d Bitcoin maximalists\u2014pointing to Novogratz\u2019s Luna investment\u2014would argue that he is not one of them since they \u201cstrive to stay clear\u201d of the \u201cscam-ridden crypto industry\u201d and \u201cdo not even consider Bitcoin to be the same thing as \u2018crypto,\u2019\u201d as one reader wrote to us."

It's just ridiculous that anybody would buy this stuff,\" Munger, 99, told CNBC's Becky Quick during a livestream of the event, adding: \"It's totally absolutely crazy, stupid gambling.\"\n\nCryptocurrency's advocates maintain that digital assets offer privacy, security, better transaction speeds and lower costs than traditional financial institutions.\n\nBut Munger, a longtime stock investor with a net worth of $2.3 billion, doesn't buy it. \"I think the people who oppose my position are idiots, so I don't think there is a rational argument against my position,\" he said.\n\nMunger's comments come amid an avalanche of problems for crypto investors over the past year.\n\nThe crypto market lost roughly $2 trillion last year. Bitcoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, lost more than 60% of its value in 2022. And the implosion of FTX, a now-bankrupt crypto trading platform once valued at $32 billion, has shaken investors' confidence as the industry feels the ripple effects of the company's collapse.\n\n\"Many Americans are coming to realize that cryptocurrency is just a speculative mania and the industry is rife with crooks,\" James Royal, a principal reporter at Bankrate, tells CNBC Make It. Indeed, just 8% of Americans have a positive view of cryptocurrency as of November, according to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey.\n\nOn Wednesday, Munger said he's not proud of his country \"for allowing this crap.\" He's previously urged the U.S. government to ban cryptocurrencies, and may partially get his wish as the crypto industry faces rising regulatory crackdowns.\n\nIncreased scrutiny of crypto-trading firms and investment advisors are among the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's top priorities this year, as outlined in the agency's \"2023 Examination Priorities Report.\"\n\nThe SEC's examinations will focus on the \"offer, sale, recommendation of or advice regarding trading in crypto or crypto-related assets,\" the report says.\n\nThe agency voted Wednesday to expand federal rules that, if passed into law, could require crypto exchanges to hold their assets with a federal- or state-chartered bank to act as a custodian over customers' virtual currency.\n\nThe proposal puts crypto firms in a \"no-win\" scenario, SEC commissioner Mark Uyeda wrote in a statement on Wednesday. U.S. regulators have already warned banks that dealing with crypto exposes them to an array of risks, including fraud and scam.\n\n\"In other words, an adviser may custody crypto assets at a bank, but banks are cautioned by their regulators not to custody crypto assets,\" Uyeda wrote.\n\nGet CNBC's free Warren Buffett Guide to Investing, which distills the billionaire's No. 1 best piece of advice for regular investors, do's and don'ts, and three key investing principles into a clear and simple guidebook.\n\nSign up now: Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter"

        "title": "Crypto is here to save the grid. Or crash it. - E&E News by POLITICO",
        "content": "Like energy, cryptocurrency is subject to booms and busts \u2014 and last year was definitely a bust.\n\nBut with the value of bitcoin and other digital currencies beginning to rebound after plummeting in 2022, there are renewed concerns that cryptominers could wreak havoc on the electric grid and U.S. carbon-cutting plans.\n\nThat has prompted crypto companies to reframe their role on the grid, eyeing ways to both minimize power demand and boost ties to renewable energy. The industry is aware that a possible regulatory crackdown could halt the days of unfettered electricity use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is an industry with a lot of ethical holes in it, and one of the biggest is the impact on the environment,\u201d Erran Carmel, a technology professor at American University, said of cryptocurrency.\n\nCryptocurrency has long been branded a climate villain. Companies acquire virtual coins by solving a series of computational puzzles in a \u201cmining\u201d process that essentially requires a fleet of computers to be running for long hours. Depending on where those computers are located, the load may be met by natural gas or coal plants, delaying a transition to renewable energy and generating more climate-warming emissions.\n\nAccording to a report from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, as of August 2022, total global electricity use for crypto was as high as 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year, more than the total electricity used in a year by Argentina.\n\nIn the United States \u2014 which hosts about a third of the world\u2019s crypto operations \u2014 the industry accounted for between 0.9 percent to 1.7 percent of the country\u2019s total electricity usage, higher than all residential lighting, the White House office found.\n\nThat sort of energy pull prompted New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) to sign legislation imposing a moratorium on new crypto mining in the state last year. Other state and local governments have placed their own restrictions on new crypto mining or imposed requirements that it run on renewable energy.\n\nRestrictions that go too far could hurt the industry at a time when it is looking to reshape its energy story, said John Olsen, New York state lead for the Blockchain Association.\n\n\u201cOther areas of the country have embraced this technology and enabled the kind of out-of-the-box thinking where we don\u2019t just rely on hydro or wind or solar, but have ways of curtailing emissions, capturing waste and even contributing to the overall health of the economy,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cA moratorium puts us a few steps back.\u201d\n\nFor example, he said, some crypto mines have taken root in areas where renewable energy might go to waste, offering a load that can support large-scale projects. In Texas, bitcoin companies have shown that toggling their demand up and down can help stabilize prices on the grid.\n\nThe strategy isn\u2019t just a regulatory dodge or good spin, said Joe Burnett, a mining analyst for bitcoin company Blockware Solutions. It\u2019s also good business.\n\n\u201cIf bitcoin miners are inefficient and nonprofitable, governments should let them fail,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cThis industry has the potential to balance energy grids and help supply. And I think that\u2019s a viable future for mining companies.\u201d\n\nThe power dilemma\n\nCrypto mining dipped throughout 2022, with the website digiconomist.net estimating the industry\u2019s energy use dropped more than 60 percent between January and December.\n\nThat reflects 2022\u2019s so-called \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d when prices crashed as a number of companies failed and investors pulled out of the volatile and still risky market.\n\nThe collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX Trading Ltd. in November 2022 after a liquidity crisis and allegations of fraud against CEO Sam Bankman-Fried marked a thud near the end of the year that further drove prices down and increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nWith little reward, mining naturally went down. But activity was also dented by rising electricity and natural gas prices, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas, Austin, who has consulted for crypto companies.\n\n\u201cThe main cost of these systems is electricity. It\u2019s basically a bunch of computers guessing at a particular number for trillions of guesses, which takes a lot of energy,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cSo as bitcoin prices fell, electricity prices went up. You\u2019re getting squeezed from both sides.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study by analytics firm Hashrate Index \u2014 backed by mining company Luxor Technologies \u2014 10 of the most popular states for cryptocurrency mines saw electricity prices rise between 2021 and 2022, led by a 43 percent increase in Georgia. That trend, the report says, likely contributed to the bankruptcy of Core Scientific and other cryptomining companies.\n\nThe report found that crypto companies in states with abundant hydropower and less natural gas saw the smallest price increases and had more market stability.\n\n\u201cMany miners learned a painful but important lesson in 2022: securing a low, long-term electricity price is vital to the mining business,\u201d Hashrate Index said.\n\nAs bitcoin prices have ticked up from a low point in 2022, Hashrate Index found that the computing power behind bitcoin has also risen, hitting a record peak on Jan. 20.\n\nThat has coincided with increased regulatory attention from some states and countries.\n\nOregon lawmakers have proposed a bill that would require crypto miners and data centers to meet the state\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction goals, including a 100 percent reduction by 2040. In Washington state, a new bill would require large loads served by municipal and public utilities to meet clean energy standards that currently apply to customers of investor-owned utilities.\n\nBoth states have seen an influx of crypto companies seeking low-cost, reliable hydropower. British Columbia and Manitoba in Canada have also implemented moratoria on new crypto connections.\n\nWhether renewable requirements make a difference remains to be seen.\n\nTake Missoula County in Montana, which in 2021 adopted new zoning rules mandating that crypto miners be powered with new renewable energy, either generated on site or purchased elsewhere. The rules came after the county saw a power drain and residential complaints from expanding operations by miner HyperBlock Inc., which set up shop there seeking out Montana\u2019s relatively cheap power prices.\n\nHyperBlock filed for bankruptcy in 2020 during a dip in bitcoin prices.\n\nSince the rules went into effect, no new crypto companies have applied to come to Missoula County, said Jennie Dixon of the county\u2019s Department of Planning, Development and Sustainability.\n\nIn a September report, the Office of Science and Technology Policy recommended that any policy on cryptocurrency consider its environmental and electricity impact and called for federal agencies to conduct reliability assessments for crypto mining and explore environmental standards.\n\nThe report also said that regulators could work with Congress on possible energy conservation standards for the industry.\n\nThe Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment from E&E News about future regulations.\n\nEnvironmental regulations have chased crypto miners around the globe. A large share of the industry was housed in China until 2021, when the country\u2019s government cracked down on mining and cryptocurrency transactions in part because of environmental concerns.\n\nMany companies relocated to coal-heavy Kazakhstan and the United States. A study published in the journal Joule found that, on the whole, the global industry used less renewable energy after that shift because of the power mix in the new locations.\n\nAmerican University\u2019s Carmel said that as governments come to grips with the environmental impact of the industry, bitcoin miners are \u201cdrifting from country to country to find an unregulated environment.\u201d Right now, he said, the United States offers a balance of unregulated sites and the potential for cheap power.\n\nA path forward\n\nOn the other hand, some states are instead encouraging cryptocurrency miners to move in, eager to have an emerging technology take root there. And the miners say that despite the concerns elsewhere, they can be responsible \u2014 and beneficial \u2014 grid participants.\n\nWyoming lawmakers have considered legislation that would create deregulated power zones for large industrial customers, allowing them to operate off the regulated grid and get massive quantities of power at low prices. Supporters say that could further enable renewables to be built to support those operations, while detractors have warned it could weaken the business model for existing utilities.\n\nTexas has actively recruited cryptocurrency miners, with at least 30 companies building operations there.\n\nAccording to data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) \u2014 the grid operator covering about 90 percent of the state\u2019s power load \u2014 cryptocurrency miners consumed about 477 megawatts of continuous consumption per day over a 291-day period in 2022. ERCOT estimates that 1 MW can power 200 homes during times of peak demand.\n\nFor a grid that saw widespread blackouts in 2021, adding a load of that size has raised reliability questions.\n\nIn December, ERCOT announced a voluntary program that would allow bitcoin miners to reduce power during high demand periods, building on a pilot launched last summer. That can reduce the grid\u2019s demand during winter storms and heat waves, while also offering crypto mines a potential source of income by selling back power when prices are higher.\n\nRhodes, the Texas researcher, said his research shows that under certain conditions a flexible cryptocurrency industry could result in more renewables being added to the grid because they offer a low-cost source of power that would not need to run continuously.\n\nBut, he added, matching \u201ccontrollable load with uncontrollable generation\u201d would require companies to \u201cbe economically flexible.\u201d\n\nBlockware\u2019s Burnett said that similar demand response programs could offer a responsible path forward for the mining industry, soaking up excess power from renewables and selling it during peak times.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in demand response mode, you enable consumers to have power without paying these ridiculous prices,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about energy that would already be wasted during normal times that can be used to mine.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, University of Houston energy fellow Ed Hirs wrote in a Barron\u2019s editorial that allowing large users to sell back to the grid amounted to \u201ccronyism\u201d that would drive up prices for other consumers.\n\nEven with demand response, critics say that adding significant load to a national grid in the midst of an energy transition is likely to keep fossil fuel plants online longer.\n\nSustainable Bitcoin Protocol, a new company backed by major bitcoin miners, is seeking to put heft behind the environmental promise by offering transferrable assets representing coins mined with 100 percent clean power.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure there\u2019s no greenwashing in bitcoin,\u201d said Elliot David, Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol\u2019s head of climate strategy and partnerships, alluding to the practice of making something appear more environmentally friendly than it is.\n\nThe company will use third-party platforms to track the energy sources going into a mining company, then offer a separate certificate similar to a renewable energy certificate to that company, which can be sold on the market.\n\nDavid said the company doesn\u2019t just want to push existing miners to use renewables, but will eventually make the full industry climate positive as it expands.\n\n\u201cBitcoin basically converts and monetizes electricity into a globally liquid currency,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a place with high energy costs could use it to enable and unleash clean energy development. That\u2019s why we want to maximize green sources.\u201d\n\nBut those efforts can only be considered successful if you think that cryptocurrency mining is a necessity, said Carmel, the technology professor.\n\n\u201cOn a micro level, crypto mining companies may use alternative energy sources \u2026 and may work on a dynamic basis on the grid, which is good. But on a macro level, we have a responsibility to reduce the environmental impact of any industry and of course any pollution,\u201d Carmel said. \u201cThat forces you to consider the main question: Is there a higher purpose to crypto, or is this just a Las Vegas casino?\u201d"

The death cross appears on a chart when an asset\u2019s short-term moving average, usually the 50-day, crosses below its long-term moving average, usually the 200-day. Despite the bearish nature of the pattern, the death cross has been followed by above-average short-term returns in recent years.\n\nThe crypto community reacted differently, with Bitcoin proponents calling it the start of another bull run. Samson Mow commented on the price surge, \u201cBTC price is still below the 200 WMA, which is 25k. Bitcoin trading below the 200 WMA is an anomaly.\u201d In each of its major market cycles, Bitcoin\u2019s price historically bottoms out around the 200-week moving average. Others called the recent price surge a bear trap while warning that large players are cashing out."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied over 12% on Feb. 15, marking the highest daily close in more than six months. Curiously, the movement happened while gold reached a 40-day low at $1,826, indicating some potential shift in investors\u2019 risk assessment for cryptocurrencies.\n\nA stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation report on Feb. 14 showed consumer prices rising 5.6% year-on-year, followed by data showing resilient consumer demand, causing traders to rethink Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity value. U.S. retail sales increased by 3% in January over the previous month \u2014 the highest gain in almost two years.\n\nOn-chain data indicates that the recent gains can be traced back to a mysterious institutional investor that started buying on Feb. 10. According to Lookonchain\u2019s data, nearly $1.6 billion in funds have flowed into the crypto market between Feb. 10 and Feb. 15. The analysis showed that three notable USD Coin (USDC) wallets sent out funds to various exchanges around the same time.\n\nMore importantly, news emerged that the Binance exchange is preparing to face penalties and settle eventual outstanding regulatory and law-enforcement investigations in the U.S., according to a Feb. 15 Wall Street Journal report. The exchange\u2019s chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillmann, added that Binance was \u201chighly confident and feeling really good about where those discussions are going.\u201d\n\nLet's look at derivatives metrics to understand better how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin margined longs entered the \u201cFOMO\u201d range\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because it allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nFor example, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy (long) Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet against (short) the cryptocurrency. Unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn\u2019t always matched.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio increased between Jan. 13 and Jan. 15, signaling that professional traders added leverage long positions as Bitcoin price broke above the $23,500 resistance.\n\nOne might argue that the demand for borrowing stablecoins for bullish positioning is excessive as a stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio above 30 is unusual. However, traders tend to deposit more collateral after a few days or weeks, causing the indicator to exit the FOMO level.\n\nOptions traders remain skeptical of a sustained rally\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent rally has caused investors to become more risk-averse. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nThe indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put options premium is higher than risk call options.\n\nIn short, the skew metric will move above 10% if traders fear a Bitcoin price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 10% skew.\n\nRelated: $24K Bitcoin \u2014 Is it time to buy BTC and altcoins? Watch Market Talks live\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nNotice that the 25% delta skew has been neutral for the past two weeks, signaling equal pricing for bullish and bearish strategies. This reading is highly unusual considering Bitcoin gained 16.2% from Jan. 13 to Jan. 16 and typically, one would expect excessive bullishness causing the skew to move below negative 10.\n\nOne thing is for sure, a lack of bearish sentiment is present in futures and options markets. Still, there are some concerning data on excessive margin demand for leverage buying, although it is too soon to call it worrisome.\n\nThe longer Bitcoin remains above $24,000, the more comfortable those pro traders become with the current rally. Moreover, bears using futures markets had $235 million liquidated between Jan. 15 and Jan. 16, resulting in a decreasing appetite for bearish bets. Hence, the derivatives markets continue to favor bullish momentum.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "What Is Wrapped Crypto?\n\nBy Mohammad Musharraf\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2014 A wrapped crypto token is a tokenized representation of a particular cryptocurrency, with the exact same value, that is operable on another blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Wrapped tokens make it easy to transfer value across blockchains, which otherwise lack interoperability, and power a cross-chain decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Some of the most popular wrapped tokens are WBTC, WETH, WMATIC, and renBTC.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the blockchain and crypto space is the lack of interoperability of different blockchains and their respective assets.\n\nThat means you cannot directly transfer a cryptocurrency based on chain X to chain Y and use it there. Blockchains, by design, cannot enable such cross-chain digital asset support.\n\nWith decentralized finance (DeFi) predominantly on Ethereum, but coins and tokens existing across multiple other blockchains, supporting assets cross-chain has become crucial for cryptocurrencies and DeFi.\n\nThis is where wrapped crypto tokens come into the picture. You might have heard people mention \u201cwrapped Bitcoin\u201d or \u201cwrapped Ether\u201d. But what are they exactly?\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Crypto?\n\nWrapped crypto or wrapped tokens are digital assets that; represent the exact value of an original cryptocurrency from a different blockchain or follow a different token standard to the chain its on. WBTC and WETH are good examples of the former and latter respectively.\n\nWrapping original tokens to mint new tokens compliant with another blockchain allows users to use assets from one chain on another chain entirely.\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s use Bitcoin (BTC) as an example. By design, bitcoin can originally only function inside the Bitcoin ecosystem. But what if you want to use the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency on the world\u2019s largest dApp blockchain Ethereum?\n\nIn short, there\u2019s a way to deposit your BTC from your Bitcoin wallet and receive wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) \u2014 an ERC-20 token \u2014 in your Ethereum wallet.\n\nThe WBTC you receive will be a wrapped crypto token. In short, it represents the original value of the BTC that you deposited. Owning that wrapped Bitcoin then means you can use Ethereum-based decentralized application that support wrapped bitcoin transactions. Put simply, you can transfer the value of bitcoin while using Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nAs mentioned, \u201cwrapping\u201d is a just figurative term used to describe the minting or creation of a new token that derives its value from an underlying digital asset.\n\nTo understand this better, let\u2019s take a look at how wrapped crypto actually works.\n\nHow Do Wrapped Crypto Tokens Work?\n\nSo far, you know that a wrapped token is an equivalent representation of a cryptocurrency based on a different blockchain. Or, in some cases, it is a representation of an asset based on the same chain, but having a different token standard.\n\nBut how do we exactly \u201cwrap\u201d these tokens?\n\nLet\u2019s go back to wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) for a moment.\n\nFor starters, there are three types of entities involved in the wrapping of BTC to create an equivalent amount of WBTC on Ethereum:\n\n1. Merchants: Entities that lock their BTC to mint new WBTC on Ethereum or, conversely, burn WBTC to free up the locked BTC.\n\n2. Custodians: Organizations responsible for securing the BTC reserves on the Bitcoin network.\n\n3: Wrapped Tokens DAO: A set of organizations that constitute a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and collectively decide what custodians and merchants to add or remove to WBTC Network. The organizations in the DAO use a multi-sig wallet to make these decisions.\n\nNow that you understand the three key players in WBTC, let\u2019s look at a simple step-by-step process of token wrapping:\n\nStep 1: A merchant sends 10 Bitcoin (BTC) to the custodian.\n\nStep 2: The custodian adds it to a reserve (a crypto wallet) whose proof is published on-chain.\n\nStep 3: An equal amount of ERC-20 compatible WBTC is minted on Ethereum.\n\nMerchants can follow a similar process to request to burn WBTC on the Ethereum blockchain and free an equal number of BTC on the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhile WBTC relies on a DAO model to ensure security and decentralization, wrapped tokens are issued either by centralized entities or smart contracts.\n\nHowever, most DeFi proponents advise against using a wrapped token managed by a centralized entity. This is because a central entity may, at any point, defraud its users by tampering with the asset reserves. These reserves determine a wrapped token\u2019s value. Thus, in situations like these, a wrapped token can lose significant value in a short time.\n\nApart from WBTC, there are several other wrapped tokens such as WETH, WMATIC, renBTC, WFTM. Across the DeFi space, there are multiple wrapper platforms issuing such tokens.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve understood how wrapped tokens work, let\u2019s check out what benefits they offer.\n\nBenefits of Wrapped Crypto Tokens\n\nThere are 197 countries in the world using around 180 different currencies. These countries have a combined total of thousands of banks.\n\nImagine a world where you were not able to send money from one bank to the other. Further still, imagine you visited a country that didn\u2019t allow you to exchange your currency for its own. That would make for a terrible financial ecosystem, where people would fail to experience anything beyond the limits of their own country or bank.\n\nCurrently, the same would be the case with users of different blockchains if not for wrapped tokens.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC makes up over 40% of the crypto market\u2019s value. Following BTC is ETH, making up almost 20% of the market capitalization.\n\nThanks to WBTC and other wrapped representatives of BTC, Bitcoin users no more need to stay cut off from Ethereum, which boasts the largest DeFi ecosystem. They can simply go to a decentralized exchange and purchase WBTC. That way, the user gets the same exposure to BTC, but on Ethereum.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about Bitcoin and Ethereum. In fact, there are a wide variety of wrapped tokens for transferring value between popular chains, such as Polygon, Solana and Avalanche.\n\nWith the help of wrapped tokens, users don\u2019t need to transfer their assets on one chain to a centralized exchange, convert it to another asset, and send it to another compatible chain. Instead, they can get their hands on a wrapped token representing their original asset.\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)?\n\nWrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is a joint initiative run by three Web3 entities: Kyber, Ren, and BitGo. These are three of the 15 entities in total that make up the Wrapped Tokens DAO. Collectively, they are responsible for minting and burning wrapped bitcoin. They also manage, i.e. add or remove, merchants and custodians.\n\nA total of 65 projects, protocols, and companies currently make up the Wrapped Bitcoin Network. These include lending and borrowing platforms, decentralized exchanges, centralized custodians. Wrapped Bitcoin is a now an integral part of many leading platforms and apps; from DeFi to much more.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s really easy to get started. Users can directly exchange their existing ERC-20 tokens to wrapped Bitcoin and back as it behaves just like any other fungible Ethereum token.\n\nWrapped Tokens on Ethereum\n\nAt the time of writing, the total value locked in DeFi is over $42 billion. More than $25 billion of that is on Ethereum, making it the single largest DeFi ecosystem. That only makes it practical for almost every project to make its token compatible with Ethereum token standard ERC-20.\n\nWrapped crypto comes to the rescue for projects building on different blockchains. Wrapping tokens, therefore making them ERC-20 compliant, enables a project\u2019s users to experience the speed and scalability of other chains. Plus, all of this is possible without missing out on Ethereum\u2019s large user base and liquidity.\n\nIn fact, since ETH was created before the ERC-20 standard was established, it does not comply with ERC-20. Hence, we use a wrapped version of ETH called \u2018wrapped ether\u2019 (WETH) across DeFi protocols on Ethereum.\n\nHow To Secure Wrapped Crypto Tokens\n\nWrapped tokens, or crypto tokens or any kind for that matter, are a form of digital value. And much like physical assets in the real world, protecting your digital assets (such as wrapped tokens) is imperative.\n\nSpeaking of security, nothing comes close to hardware wallets such as Ledger Nano S Plus, Nano X, and Stax in terms of securing your assets.\n\nLedger wallets keep your private keys and seed phrase offline at all times, ensuring no one can virtually tamper with or access your wrapped tokens. Despite your keys being offline, you can still access a wide range of DeFi protocols online through Ledger Live \u2014 a mobile and desktop application that connects with your Ledger wallet.\n\nThis brings maximum security to your wrapped tokens without compromising on your flexibility to use them across DeFi platforms.\n\nKnowledge is power"

Still, the tech titans aren\u2019t the only ones bringing innovation to the sector.\n\nIn an effort to highlight up-and-coming tech companies, Built In launched The Future 5 across seven major U.S. tech hubs. Each quarter, we will feature five early-stage tech companies, nonprofits or entrepreneurs in each of these hubs who just might be working on the next big thing. Read our round-up of Austin\u2019s rising companies from last quarter here.\n\n* * *\n\nOver the last few years, several tech companies \u2014 including many based in Chicago \u2014 have released new products that disrupted the music industry. Now, Wavlake is looking to make its mark on the industry after raising pre-seed funding and announcing plans to grow its artist streaming payment platform.\n\nWavlake was co-founded by musicians and producers Michael Rhee and Sam Means. Through the use of blockchain and Web3 tools, their platform helps support artists financially. Wavlake is a music and podcast streaming platform that allows artists to receive Bitcoin payments from their fans.\n\n\u201cI had been frustrated with music recommendation algorithms on streaming platforms for a long time. Then I learned about Lightning Network and how it enabled people to transmit Bitcoin to each other almost instantly around the world. The technology seemed like a great way to build a new kind of music streaming service that better-connected artists and fans,\u201d Rhee told Built In via email.\n\nIn December, Wavlake closed a pre-seed round led by Trammell Venture Partners, an Austin-based VC firm focused on backing early-stage Bitcoin-native startups. Wavlake did not disclose the amount of capital it raised; however, it said the funding would be put toward growing the company and its products.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping this helps inspire other companies and developers to make new and interesting music applications that are both fairer to artists and more enjoyable for fans.\u201d\n\nWith the new capital, Wavlake plans to onboard more artists and creators onto its platform. Over the next year, Rhee and Means said they will also build out the Wavlake team and improve the platform\u2019s foundation to better accommodate its growing artist base.\n\nBy continuing to build blockchain-enabled tools for creators, Wavlake hopes it can inspire others to create new technologies to support artists and their work.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t building any custom blockchain technology or issuing any kind of special token,\u201d Rhee said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this helps inspire other companies and developers to make new and interesting music applications that are both fairer to artists and more enjoyable for fans.\u201d\n\nMore Chicago Future 5 CoverageThe Dibz Aims to Combat Clothing Waste With Online Shopping Platform"

        "title": "Crypto failed Black investors \u2014 and so has banking - Vox.com",
        "content": "Crypto was sold as a sort of lifeline to Black communities, as a way to build wealth outside of the mainstream financial system that many people, understandably, mistrust. The crypto complex told the story of a potential for riches, a way for people left out of more traditional financial apparatuses to get in, bombarding the Black population with marketing and ads featuring celebrities such as LeBron James and Spike Lee. The industry made it clear: If you didn\u2019t get in, well, you might just be missing out. Many Black investors picked up what marketers were putting down, investing in cryptocurrency at higher rates than their white counterparts \u2014 especially Black investors under 40.\n\nNow, cryptocurrencies are trading well below their 2021 highs. Many NFTs have plummeted in value and are essentially worthless. Some high-profile projects and companies in the space have imploded, and it\u2019s not clear what, if anything, customers who put their money into those entities will get back. All is not totally lost. Investors who got into cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum in the early days are still ahead (assuming they haven\u2019t lost the coins or had them scammed away). Crypto often goes through boom and bust cycles, and it\u2019s unlikely the ecosystem is dead.\n\nStill, Black investors were not generally among that early group to dive into crypto, as the Atlantic\u2019s Annie Lowrey notes. Instead, many of them got in late, and some appear to have bought high and sold low. According to a recent LendingTree survey, Black crypto investors were likelier than white crypto investors to say that they had borrowed money to make their investment and that they had sold their crypto for less than it was worth. In other words, some Black investors have been left holding the bag.\n\n\u201cThe idea that crypto is somehow providing an avenue that\u2019s easier than other forms doesn\u2019t pan out. It\u2019s not as democratizing and welcoming as suggested,\u201d said Algernon Austin, director of race and economic justice at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who has spoken out in the past about the risks of crypto to Black communities. \u201cThe crypto industry is concerned about the crypto industry, it\u2019s not concerned about Black wealth.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar tale throughout America\u2019s history, explained Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of California Irvine and author of multiple books on financial inequality and the racial wealth gap. She drew parallels to housing contract sales offered to Black communities in the wake of the New Deal in the 1950s and \u201960s and to subprime home loans prior to the global financial crisis disproportionately made to communities of color. In both instances, Black consumers were targeted with predatory financial products existing somewhat on the margins.\n\nMost notably, she pointed to the Freedman\u2019s Savings and Trust Company, more colloquially known as the Freedman\u2019s Bank, a private savings bank established by Congress in the wake of the Civil War meant to help formerly enslaved people establish financial stability. The endeavor lasted for nine years and ended in disaster \u2014 its funds were mishandled, and eventually, the bank collapsed. Many depositors never saw their money again.\n\n\u201cYou have the perfect conditions that led to the Freedman\u2019s Bank, that led to the subprime crisis, that led to the contract sales after the New Deal, which is that capitalism is undergoing some shift and something is wrong and the government needs to handle it, but instead, they leave out certain people and then some terrible, exploitative incentive gets born, and someone is always going to step into that,\u201d Baradaran said.\n\n\u201cIt is a looting of people\u2019s money\u201d\n\nIn the 19th century, that took the shape of a bank that squandered Black people\u2019s money and sowed skepticism of the financial system that persists today. In the 21st century, it was a pitch to build wealth through a new, largely unregulated technology that would later see the bottom substantially fall out. \u201cIt is a looting of people\u2019s money,\u201d Baradaran said.\n\nTo back up a bit \u2014 or, rather, a lot, to after the Civil War \u2014 the US Congress established the Freedman\u2019s Bank in 1865. It was meant to serve as a savings institution for formerly enslaved people and their families, and deposits were supposed to be invested in \u201cstocks, bonds, Treasury notes, or other securities of the United States.\u201d Other loans weren\u2019t initially intended to be made.\n\nAs Baradaran explained in her 2017 book, The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap, a bank wasn\u2019t exactly an ideal solution \u2014 giving formerly enslaved people land would have been better. \u201cBlacks had not asked for the bank, but land grants having been foreclosed on by violence and southern retrenchment, the bank was a stand-in,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe reformers promised the Black community that the bank was the preferred and proper means by which they would achieve land ownership on their own.\u201d\n\nThe Freedman\u2019s Bank opened in New York in April of 1865 and over the course of a few years built up 19 branches. Eventually, the bank hit 37 branches and had tens of thousands of depositors. People were allowed to open accounts with as little as 5 cents, and most deposits were under $60. The bank struggled financially, and in 1867, its headquarters were moved to Washington, DC, and a new group of bankers, politicians, and businessmen took the wheel. Congress changed the bank\u2019s charter to let the people now running the show invest in real estate and railroads, and they started to make risky bets. When financial panic hit in 1873, it took an enormous toll on the Freedman\u2019s Bank, and the value of its investments plunged. There was a run on several branches, meaning many depositors tried to get their money out all at once, and by the time Congress sent regulators to take a look under the hood at what was going on, it was largely too late.\n\nIn 1874, abolitionist and writer Frederick Douglass was brought in to run the bank, but he quickly realized it was \u201cthe black man\u2019s cow, but the white man\u2019s milk.\u201d Less than two months later, he described the situation as being \u201cmarried to a corpse\u201d and recommended Congress shutter the bank, which it did in June of that year. The bank\u2019s assets were not backed by the federal government \u2014 a fact many customers had not realized \u2014 and many customers\u2019 deposits were gone.\n\nIn The Souls of Black Folk, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote that \u201cnot even ten additional years of slavery could have done so much to throttle the thrift of the freedmen as the mismanagement and bankruptcy of the series of savings banks chartered by the Nation for their special aid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat should have happened in 1865 is that the treasonous Southerners should have lost their land because they had fought for the right to maintain slavery, and the people who for hundreds of years had grown the land should have gotten it,\u201d Baradaran said in an interview. Instead, they got a poorly run bank, their money was squandered on irresponsible investments, and they were left with nothing.\n\nWhen the mainstream system doesn\u2019t work \u2014 and it really doesn\u2019t for many Black Americans \u2014 it\u2019s natural to look elsewhere for something that does\n\nThe incident contributed to an ongoing mistrust of banks among Black communities. And in the modern day, it\u2019s also hard not to see the parallels between the Freedman\u2019s Bank and the most recent crypto implosion, where once again upstart institutions meant to be a new avenue for people to build wealth have gone bottoms-up or, at the very least, are teetering. \u201cThis is what you see with bitcoin, you get the scammers and the hucksters and the fraud, people who come in and say, \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to exploit people\u2019s genuine desire to build wealth in a fucked-up system,\u2019\u201d Baradaran said.\n\nWhen the mainstream system doesn\u2019t work \u2014 and it really doesn\u2019t for many Black Americans \u2014 it\u2019s natural to look elsewhere for something that does. That\u2019s where the appeal of something like crypto resides. People are told it\u2019s a way to establish financial independence and freedom and get away from the institutions that have wronged them in the past. It\u2019s a prospect that\u2019s easy to want to believe in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that the Black population has more economic hardship and economic insecurity than the white population or the US population overall on average. You have more poverty, higher rates of debt, higher rates of insecurity, unstable work hours, unaffordable housing, there are a number of financial stresses in the lives of many African Americans,\u201d Austin said. \u201cSo when you\u2019re worrying how you\u2019re going to pay your bills regularly and how you\u2019re going to get ahead and someone shows up and says, \u2018I have the solution, and this will help you pay all your bills and help you pay your kids\u2019 college and the house that you\u2019ve always dreamed about,\u2019 that\u2019s pretty enticing.\u201d\n\nCharlotte Principato, financial services analyst at polling firm Morning Consult, said Black Americans \u201cshow through their higher ownership of cryptocurrency than adults of other races or ethnicities that they are open to alternative forms of payment and investment outside the sphere of traditional finance\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cnot surprising\u201d that they\u2019re interested in alternative assets given that the mainstream system has not served them well. \u201cIt makes sense that they would try to stake their claim and find success,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is unfortunate that it is that way with such a speculative asset.\u201d\n\nIn conversations with crypto proponents over the years, I\u2019ve heard time and time again that it is specifically good for communities of color, that it\u2019s solving a problem for the unbanked, meaning people without banking access, and the underbanked, people who have banking accounts but often rely on other financial services, such as payday loans and check-cashing services, in the day to day.\n\nIt\u2019s an argument that\u2019s nice to believe. It\u2019s also one that often falls apart: With potential upside risk comes a lot of the downside risk we\u2019re seeing today.\n\nFor one thing, it\u2019s rare to hear people who work on financial inclusion more broadly offer up crypto as a solution. They\u2019re much likelier to push for postal banking and public banking and advocate for more credit unions. It\u2019s hard to see how a hyper-capitalist, unregulated system would avoid the mistakes our already-capitalist, sometimes lightly regulated system already entails. And to state the obvious here, the crypto industry is here to make money. Businesses in the space aren\u2019t generally doing business out of the goodness of their hearts.\n\n\u201cThe marketing campaign is not out of generosity or philanthropy, that\u2019s the business model, the business model requires getting as many people as possible so then prices go up,\u201d Austin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an investment that\u2019s built on providing any goods or service, so once you understand that, you understand you\u2019re really resting on herd mentality, only then you have to go with the herd and then make sure to jump away before it goes off the cliff.\u201d\n\nMany investors \u2014 including many Black investors \u2014 did not jump away soon enough.\n\nTo be sure, the crypto industry has not completely imploded, though many big names in the arena have. There are plenty of people who still say they believe it is an avenue for building wealth. Charlene Fadirepo, a regulator turned bitcoin activist, told me she thinks the 2022 market crash was an \u201cincredible teachable moment\u201d for crypto investors to become safe, smart, and confident. \u201cTo be honest, traditional banking doesn\u2019t have a great track record dealing with Black consumers,\u201d she said, an assertion that is hard to dispute. She still believes bitcoin, specifically, has an appeal in offering \u201cfinancial autonomy,\u201d though she\u2019s somewhat dubious of other cryptocurrencies. \u201cThere are fundamentals that promote bitcoin as a long-term investment ... that is not the case for all cryptocurrencies,\u201d she said.\n\nFadirepo recalled a recent class she was teaching on crypto in South Carolina where a Black woman in the class said she had lost $3,000 when Celsius, a now-bankrupt crypto lender, failed. The woman didn\u2019t want people to feel bad for her, Fadirepo said, but wanted people to realize they need to protect their crypto by storing it in a \u201ccold storage wallet,\u201d meaning not on a third-party platform and not connected to the internet. \u201cI could have talked for hours, but that one anecdote shifted the conversation in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cI see a bright side here, and that bright side is just encouraging a level of investor discipline and a real need to be informed.\u201d\n\nThat people sometimes just need to learn lessons from their mistakes is something you hear often in investing; there\u2019s a line of thought that loss is sometimes just an opportunity to do better moving forward. While often delivered with the best of intentions, the sentiment can feel hollow. Many times, investors aren\u2019t clear on the rules of the game they\u2019re playing, and the people they\u2019re playing against \u2014 or the people who are running the game \u2014 aren\u2019t forthcoming about what\u2019s going on in the background. Placing the blame on the losers, especially when they\u2019re set up to lose, happens time and time again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the double whammy of not only is your money stolen, but as far as anyone knows, it\u2019s your fault, you should have known better,\u201d Baradaran said. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking how similar those arguments end up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the system\u2019s broken, let\u2019s fix it\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no denying the American financial system is in many ways stacked against Black investors and consumers. And the best way to address that might be to try to fix the system instead of creating new avenues or endeavors, whether the Freedman\u2019s Bank or some crypto project, which have many of the same failings but without the guardrails.\n\n\u201cIf the system\u2019s broken, let\u2019s fix it, instead of saying, \u2018Look, the system\u2019s broken, let\u2019s create this other system,\u2019\u201d Baradaran said, comparing it to deciding to go live on Mars because Earth is too screwed up. \u201cIt\u2019s losing all the lessons that we had to learn the hard way in this financial system, which is that you need trust, you have to have trust. And if we allow fraud without regulation, there will always be fraud.\u201d\n\nFraud and mistrust are what have led many Black consumers to faulty offers and products over and over again. The latest iteration is crypto, but it probably won\u2019t be the last."

        "title": "Four Reasons Why Bitcoin (BTC) is Driving Higher - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC) price movement is on fire, and it is now testing a significant level of resistance that may open the floodgates for bulls and propel the BTC price far higher. Some traders may be perplexed, and are attempting to determine the true cause of the recent surge and if it will endure. Bitcoin's price has increased by more than 50 percent so far this year, and it has hit a price level of 24,900, a level not seen in almost six months. The crypto market lost around $1.4 trillion last year due to the industry's extreme instability.\n\nWe'll go over four different reasons behind Bitcoin's recent rise, and whether this surge is sustainable.\n\nReason number one\n\nWhenever Bitcoin's price shoots up, there is almost always a high sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) among traders and investors. Investors are aware that despite all the criticism, major frauds in the cryptocurrency field, and regulatory issues, bitcoin is a beast capable of leaving all these concerns in the dust and rallying like there's no tomorrow.\n\nThe instant bitcoin's price seems to be moving somewhat, it draws attention to itself, causing people to get anxious and believe they cannot afford to miss the chance again. Fear of missing out is one of the primary causes for the present action.\n\nReason number two\n\nA recent regulatory crackdown by U.S. regulators on the Kraken and Paxos exchanges had traders on edge from a fundamental perspective. The New York State Department of Financial Services instructed Paxos to cease the minting of BUSD, Binance's stablecoin. Stablecoins are generally understood to be a kind of cryptocurrency that is partly backed by real assets and partially backed by cash, bonds, or other comparable assets. The risk is that BUSD might be classed as a security by the SEC, and if that occurs, Paxos and Binance could face much larger problems.\n\nThe SEC earlier had sent a strong message to the industry when it penalized Kraken for their staking operation. The whole exchange-operated crypto staking industry is still at risk, since Coinbase's CEO has expressed similar worries. Investors must bear these risks in mind.\n\nNotwithstanding these regulatory requirements, the SEC continues to assert that Bitcoin is a commodity and not a security. Because of the imminent danger of being branded as a security, more investors feel comfortable placing their money in Bitcoin since it has already passed the SEC's labelling test, which was the greatest threat to Bitcoin's survival except its widespread adoption.\n\nReason number three\n\nIn terms of technical price movement, the BTC price continues to retain a strong correlation with equities, particularly the Nasdaq index. The index has increased by more than 16% so far this year as investors continue to purchase bargains after the technology sector saw a big sell-off in 2022. Bitcoin has outperformed the Nasdaq by more than three times year to date.\n\nAs a result of the improbable occurrence of a severe recession in the U.S. economy, the stock markets are expected to see more upward movement. If the risk rally gains further momentum and the connection holds, a robust bull trend might emerge.\n\nReason number four\n\nThe BTC price has been consolidating for an extended period of time, and only yesterday, with its new six-month high, did it break out of this consolidation zone. Now, all eyes will be on the next significant resistance level, which is the $30,000 mark. A breach of this resistance will allow the price to attack its next significant price level, which will be the psychologically significant 50K price level.\n\nAll four elements are contributing to the recent surge in the price of BTC.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin broke through the US$24,000 price ceiling for the first time in two weeks to reach its highest price since mid-August in Thursday morning trading in Asia, as investors liquidated almost US$70 million of mostly short-position bets, according to data aggregator GlassNode. The short positions, or bets the price of Bitcoin would fall, had grown following a series of U.S. regulatory crackdowns this month on crypto services. Ether rose with the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, with Solana leading the gains.\n\nSee related article: Sam Bankman-Fried banned from using VPNs while on bail: Bloomberg\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 9.4% in the last 24 hours to trade at US$24,318 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its gains over the past seven days to 6%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum rose 7.5% to US$1,674, a total gain of 1.4% for the week.\n\nSolana jumped 9.4% to US$23.88, up 2.9% for the past seven days. Cardano added 8.3% to US$0.41, a weekly gain of 6.1% following the successful deployment of the network\u2019s Valentine upgrade yesterday. The upgrade aims to make it easier for developers to build cross-chain applications on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nBNB rose 7.1% to US$317.39. The token is still down 3.2% after the New York Department of Financial Services told Paxos Trust Co. to stop issuing the U.S. dollar-pegged Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin. BUSD is issued through a collaboration with Paxos and BNB\u2019s issuer Binance Global Inc., which runs the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization in the 24 hours rose 6.9% to US$1.10 trillion, the highest since mid-August, with total trading volume up 7.9% to US$63.61 billion.\n\nU.S. equities rose on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, the S&P 500 Index added 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day up 0.9%.\n\nWednesday\u2019s gains follow the release the day before of January\u2019s Consumer Price Index that showed prices rose 0.5% for the month and 6.4% year-on-year. While these figures were slightly higher than the expected monthly increase of 0.4% and annual 6.2%, they do show that inflation has followed a downward trajectory for the past several months in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe year-on-year CPI in December came in at 6.5% from the 7.1% recorded in November, which in turn declined from October\u2019s 7.7% and 8.2% in September.\n\nThe Fed, which has said it wants inflation back in the 2% range, has raised interest rates multiple times since last March to reverse the inflation surge.\n\nAnalysts at the CME Group predict a more than 90% chance that the Fed will raise rates by a further 25 basis points at its meeting next month. U.S. interest rates are currently at 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest in 15 years, and Fed officials have repeatedly indicated they could raise rates to as high as 5% to get inflation back to the central bank\u2019s target range.\n\nSee related article: Be careful what you wish for?

        "content": "A Bitcoin Golden Cross Confirmed \u2013 What The Indicators Say About A Potential Bull Run\n\nOver the same period as the Bitcoin price move, Ethereum (ETH), is also surging \u2013 up ~38.6% so far this year.\n\nWhat is perhaps even more interesting, is the short-term moving average line (3 0-day) crossing from above to below the long-term moving average line (200-day) \u2013 the so-called \u2018golden cross\u2018. It is one of the most notable technical indicators in a technical analysis trader\u2019s playbook. The golden cross has been hit on the daily chart.\n\nSource: Tradingview, Short-term blue \u2014 Long-term Red\n\nA confirmed golden cross suggests a bullish price action continuing.\n\nSource: Tradingview\n\nThere are three stages to a golden cross, The first stage is an extended downtrend. The second stage is a strong short-term reversal upward breakout \u2013 which hits its zenith when the short-term average crosses above the long-term average. The third stage, which is not always guaranteed even if the first two stages occur, is an extended price uptrend. The last time Bitcoin hit a golden cross was in June 2021, and the BTC price soared in the following months after stage 2 was reached.\n\nThis time around, however, the macro environment is quite different. After the embarrassment of the FTX debacle occurring right under its nose, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is coming after the crypto sector aggressively in the last week. Easy targets like Kraken and Coinbase are in its sights, and Kraken recently paid a $30 million fine to settle SEC charges that its staking service was actually a securities offering.\n\nUnregistered securities charges have also been levied at crypto product providers \u2014 Genesis and Gemini. In the last few days, it has been reported that the SEC is now also seeking to sue stablecoin issuer Paxos. Paxos is the issuer of two physically backed US dollar stablecoins \u2014 Paxos USD (PUSD) and Binance USD (BUSD). It also issues a gold-backed stablecoin Pax Gold (PaxG) and manages the itBit exchange.\n\nThe SEC has not yet confirmed these reports and whether there is an ongoing investigation. The initial report by the Wall Street Journal, claims that the SEC is charging Paxos for offering an unregistered security, BUSD. The price of BTC fell by 6.1% the day after the Kraken news.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s excellent beginning to 2023\n\nBitcoin and the crypto asset class, in general, have begun the year strongly on the back of cooler economic data that has hinted that interest rate increases in the United States may end soon and inflation has maxed out. Bitcoin began the year trading around US$16,500 and now trades for above US$22,000.\n\nThe first Consumer Price Index (CPI) print of the year was released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on January 19th. The report, which covered consumer prices in December 2022, showed that prices rose by 6.5% in the month. This was the smallest increase in a year and the sixth month in a row when the inflation rate had slowed. The January Consumer Price Index CPI showed that prices rose 0.5% in the first month of the year, and by 6.4% on a year-by-year basis, more than economists expected.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell has said many times this year that a disinflation process has begun in the USA and a softer economic landing may be possible. He told the Economic Club of Washington D.C. that the US Central Bank was succeeding in its fight against inflation, but acknowledged the battle is not over. He said if strong labor market and inflation data emerge, then the Fed will be forced to continue with interest rate hikes. Higher interest rates constrict the ability of investors to operate by increasing the cost of capital and making borrowing more favorable.\n\nSource: Tradingview\n\nIf the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle shows signs of ending, then Bitcoin and crypto could be set to begin a bullish flip as the shackles are pulled off investors. When the Fed finished its last tightening cycle in 2019, BTC and crypto began an extended bullish price reversal. As the chart above indicates, in the months after the Fed started to cut interest rates, the price of BTC traded sideways. Once the Fed began to aggressively drop interest rates, the price of BTC began to skyrocket. Bulls may already be backing this narrative and are buying cheaper Bitcoin in preparation.\n\nAdditionally, while more drama surrounding the FTX collapse emerged during January, markets appeared disinterested and Bitcoin prices continued to trend up. This suggests that the FTX incident has now been priced in.\n\nThe price momentum of Bitcoin has stalled, however, as new economic data suggests that the US economy is getting hotter than expected. Nonfarm payrolls, the measure of US workers excluding farm workers, increased by 517,000 for the month, This blew past analysts\u2019 expectations of a rise of 187,000. The unemployment rate in the country fell to 3.4%, the lowest since May 1969. This data is buffered by the strong January inflation data.\n\nThis suggests that a recession may be avoided in the short-to-medium and that a post-covid recovery is being undergone successfully. With macroeconomics, however, the good news is often bad news. In the shorter term, however, it means that the Fed should now have more room to continue rate hikes and use monetary policy to control inflation which sits well above the targeted 2% level\n\nOrdinals bring new utility and price surge to Bitcoin\n\nAs the charts below show, there has been a recent surge in onchain fees, active users & addresses, and miner revenue. All of this has coincided with the launch of the new Ordinals digital collectible boom on the Bitcoin network. The Ordinals protocol is a controversial, innovative new protocol that allows Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) to be stored on Bitcoin.\n\nOrdinals are not the first project to try and introduce NFTs to Bitcoin. Counterparty brought Rare Pepes to the network and Stacks continues to make progress. Ordinals are different, however, because NFTs are inscribed directly on satoshis on Bitcoin without needing a sidechain or additional token. The project\u2019s growth has been parabolic since it was launched in January with daily mints now around 10,000 a day.\n\nThe Ordinals appear to be more than just a gimmick with serious money being splashed. \u2018Bitcoin punks\u2019 takes inspiration from the popular Crypto punk franchise on the Ethereum network. One sold recently for 9.5BTC or ~US$208,000.\n\nSource: Glassnode, BTC Transfer volume\n\nSource: Glassnode, BTC TX fees \u2013 last month\n\nSource: Glassnode \u2013 BTC miner revenue \u2013 last month\n\nSource: Glassnode, BTC Active Addresses \u2013 Last month\n\nAdditionally, the Ordinals protocol utilizes Taproot. A Bitcoin transaction type that packages network transaction outputs together to make them more efficient and secure. Driven by Ordinals momentum, there has been a surge in Taproot usage over the last month.\n\nOther technical Indicators\n\nTrading volume is a measure of how much a given financial asset has been traded in a period of time. Traders look at volume to determine liquidity and the strength of conviction of a bull or bear trend.\n\nWhat may concern Bitcoin bulls is that the current surge in BTC\u2019s price has arrived with weak volume that is trending downwards. A general rule of thumb is that rising prices with lower or tepid volume are difficult to trust and the buying pressure may run out of fuel, stalling the rally.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator. It assesses the speed and magnitude of a security\u2019s recent price changes to evaluate whether it is overbought or oversold based on the veracity of the move. If a price moves too quickly too soon it is being overbought or over-sold. The general rule of thumb is that an RSI over 70 indicates that an asset may be overbought and a reading of 30 indicates that an asset is oversold.\n\nThe current RSI for bitcoin (BTC) is ~47.55 which suggests that the asset is far from oversold. It is in fact in a downtrend which suggests lagging bullish momentum.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin has reached a promised land, beyond the golden cross. The last time BTC achieved this technical bullish flag, it triggered an extended bull run that ended with new all-time highs. The bulls will be hoping for more of the same this time around.\n\nThe price push to the golden cross in 2023, has been driven by softer macroeconomic data. It has also been buoyed by a surge in usage of Bitcoin, which has been driven by an emerging use case for the network \u2014 NFTs directly inscribed onto the network.\n\nDespite the golden cross, there are some concerning flags emerging for bulls. One is major resistance at the US$24,000 price that has twice stalled price momentum for BTC in the last six months. Others include weak volume and a US Federal Reserve that may be tempted to raise interest rates aggressively again. The most concerning headwind, however, is the aggressive moves being made by the SEC, which has the potential to derail the growth of the entire sector in the United States."

        "title": "Craig Wright's case against Bitcoin SV devs reopened - The Register",
        "content": "A company owned by the man who claims to have invented Bitcoin is suing the developers of a fork of Bitcoin. Although the case was dismissed once already, it is being reopened, and a UK court will hear the Seychelles company's version of events next month.\n\nThe Court of Appeal of England and Wales has decided that the case of Tulip Trading against the developers of Bitcoin SV should be reopened. Tulip is suing 15 people and one Swiss nonprofit, Bitcoin Association, the developers behind Bitcoin SV, a fork of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\nTulip is headed up by Australian doctor of theology Craig Wright (it is unrelated to another litigious company with a similar name, extinct Dutch vendor Tulip Computers).\n\nBitcoin SV, short for \"Bitcoin Satoshi Vision,\" was forked from Bitcoin Cash in November 2018. Bitcoin Cash in turn was forked from Bitcoin in 2017. As long ago as 2015, we reported that Wright owned an Australian company called Tulip Trading.\n\nAs the Appeals Court puts it:\n\nTulip Trading Limited, a company associated with Dr Craig Wright, claims to be the owner of some bitcoin with a very high total value (the value in $ expressed in April 2021 was about $4 billion). The bitcoin is held at two addresses on the blockchain called 1Feex and 12ib7. However the private keys have been lost in a hack, likely stolen. Without its private keys Tulip cannot access its assets or move them to safety. However, Tulip contends, the developers named as defendants in this case control and run the four relevant bitcoin networks, and it would be a simple matter for them to secure Tulip's assets, e.g. by moving them to another address which Tulip can control. Tulip contends that the role the developers have undertaken in relation to Tulip's property (the bitcoin) and the power this role gives them, and all the circumstances (discussed below), mean that the developers should be recognised as a new ad hoc class of fiduciary, owing fiduciary duties to the true owners of bitcoin cryptocurrency, including in this case Tulip as true owner of the bitcoin at 1Feex and 12ib7.\n\nThe developers deny they owe fiduciary or any other duties to Tulip. They contend that they have \"nothing like the power or control Tulip alleges and that duties of the kind Tulip contend for would be highly onerous and unworkable.\"\n\nThe justices said they would allow the appeal, but cautioned that \"the conclusion is not that there is a fiduciary duty in law in the circumstances alleged by Tulip, only that the case advanced raises a serious issue to be tried.\"\n\nBack in 2016, Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous programmer who invented Bitcoin. This claim is controversial, and Wright has previously sued people who have rubbished it, although he lost that case in 2020. Lawsuits over Wright's claim to be Satoshi were still ongoing in January last year.\n\nIn 2019, Wright was instructed by a Florida court to hand over Bitcoin then valued at approximately $5 billion. As we reported in January 2022, Wright said that he was hacked and lost access to two wallets containing the money, and was suing the developers of Bitcoin SV for them to change the code to give him access to two wallets: one with 449 coins and another with 155.\n\nWe note that Bitcoin SV is currently valued at some $40. Thus, BSV604 might be sold for as much as approximately US $25,500. Whoever Satoshi Nakamoto really is, they mined about 5 percent of all Bitcoin, and hold somewhere between 750,000 and 1.1 million BTC. Even though the value of Bitcoin has been dropping sharply for some years, currently that holding is valued at $17 billion to $24 billion. \u00ae"

        "title": "Bitcoin's Correlation To Risk Assets - Nasdaq",
        "content": "While many bitcoin investors look for the asset to behave as a safe haven, bitcoin typically has ultimately acted as the riskiest of all risk allocations.\n\nThe below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nShort-Term Price Versus Long-Term Thesis\n\nHow bitcoin, the asset, will behave in the future versus how it currently trades in the market have proven to be drastically different from our long-term thesis. In this piece, we\u2019re taking a deeper look into those risk-on correlations, and comparing the returns and correlations across bitcoin and other asset classes.\n\nConsistently, tracking and analyzing these correlations can give us a better understanding if and when bitcoin has a real decoupling moment from its current trend. We don\u2019t believe we are in that period today, but expect that decoupling to be more likely over the next five years.\n\nMacro Drives Correlations\n\nFor starters, we\u2019re looking at the correlations of one-day returns for bitcoin and many other assets. Ultimately we want to know how bitcoin moves relative to other major asset classes. There\u2019s a lot of narratives on what bitcoin is and what it could be, but that\u2019s different from how the market trades it.\n\nCorrelations range from negative one to one and indicate how strong of a relationship there is between two variables, or asset returns in our case. Typically, a strong correlation is above 0.75 and a moderate correlation is above 0.5. Higher correlations show that assets are moving in the same direction with the opposite being true for negative or inverse correlations. Correlations of 0 indicate a neutral position or no real relationship. Looking at longer windows of time gives a better indication on the strength of a relationship because this removes short-term, volatile changes.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the most watched correlation with bitcoin over the last two years is its correlation with \u201crisk-on\u201d assets. Comparing bitcoin to traditional asset classes and indexes over the last year or 252 trading days, bitcoin is most correlated with many benchmarks of risk: S&P 500 Index, Russel 2000 (small cap stocks), QQQ ETF, HYG High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and the FANG Index (high-growth tech). In fact, many of these indexes have a strong correlation to each other and goes to show just how strongly correlated all assets are in this current macroeconomic regime.\n\nThe table below compare bitcoin to some key asset-class benchmarks across high beta, equities, oil and bonds.\n\nNote, you can find any of these indexes/assets on Google Finance with the tickers above. For 60/40, we\u2019re using BIGPX Blackrock 60/40 Target Allocation Fund, GSG is the S&P GSCI Commodity ETF, and BSV is the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund ETF.\n\nAnother important note is that spot bitcoin trades in a 24/7 market while these other assets and indexes do not. Correlations are likely understated here as bitcoin has proven to lead broader risk-on or liquidity market moves in the past because bitcoin can be traded at any time. As bitcoin\u2019s CME futures market has grown, using this futures data produces a less volatile view of correlation changes over time as it trades within the same time limitations as traditional assets.\n\nLooking at the rolling 3-month correlations of bitcoin CME futures versus a few of the risk-on indexes mentioned above, they all track nearly the same.\n\nBitcoin CME futures correlated with risk-on assets.\n\nAlthough bitcoin has had its own, industry-wide capitulation and deleveraging event that rival many historical bottoming events we\u2019ve seen in the past, these relationships to traditional risk haven\u2019t changed much.\n\nBitcoin has ultimately acted as the riskiest of all risk allocations and as a liquidity sponge, performing well at any hints of expanding liquidity coming back into the market. It reverses with the slightest sign of rising equities volatility in this current market regime.\n\nWe do expect this dynamic to substantially change over time as the understanding and adoption of Bitcoin accelerates. This adoption is what we view as the asymmetric upside to how bitcoin trades today versus how it will trade 5-10 years from now. Until then, bitcoin\u2019s risk-on correlations remain the dominant market force in the short-term and are key to understanding its potential trajectory over the next few months.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nLike this content?

        "title": "'Bitcoin Is the Best Brand in Crypto': Why DeGods NFTs Are Now on Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs via Ordinals are the buzziest thing in the space lately, with more than 100,000 such media assets committed to the blockchain in barely two weeks. Surprisingly, that tally includes 535 NFTs from DeGods\u2014the most valuable Solana NFT project.\n\nDeGods revealed the move on Monday as word circulated that the profile pictures (PFPs) had all been inscribed on Bitcoin in a single block. (\"Inscribing\" is the process by which NFT-like assets are created on the Bitcoin blockchain, akin to \"minting\" on Ethereum.) The 535 particular images were originally released via Solana in 2021, but were \u201cburned\u201d (or permanently destroyed) to cut down the supply in the early days of the project.\n\nProject creator Rohun Vora, who goes by the pseudonym Frank, told Decrypt that he and Dust Labs CEO Kevin Henrikson (who simply goes by Kevin) are longtime Bitcoin aficionados who relished the opportunity to bring the project onto the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s network in the early days of Ordinals momentum.\n\nAesthetics matter a lot to my team @DeGodsNFT. It was an honor working with @hash_bender to make sure there was no random trashy Ordinals minted in between all 535 DeGods. All in one block. Simple. Beautiful. Inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain forever. pic.twitter.com/Yfuvc8IDuT \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 14, 2023\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the best brand in crypto\u2014just as pristine as it gets,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt's the most well known, and truly as simple but powerful as it can get. And the mission statement is it's never been corrupted, right? It's like global sound money. That is so powerful. Aligning ourselves with the best brand in crypto is a no-brainer at any given point in time.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNow those 535 PFPs have gained a second life on Bitcoin with never-before-seen upgraded artwork. DeGods previously provided holders refreshed \u201cDeadGods\u201d artwork last year, and created upgraded artwork for the burned NFTs as well, plotting an eventual revival.\n\nNFT Sales Jump 38% in January as Bored Apes Drive Trading Surge\n\n\u201cWe always had this notion of \u2018What is dead may never die,\u2019\u201d Kevin explained, echoing the familiar refrain from the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\" \u201cAnd it was this idea, like: Holy shit, this is so perfect. We can literally bring these back, mint them as Ordinals on BTC, and it's permanent,\u201d he said.\n\nBack to life\n\nOrdinals is a unique way of inscribing NFT-like media and assets to the Bitcoin blockchain by connecting them with a single Satoshi, or 1/100,000,000th of one BTC. The media is fully stored on-chain and the Ordinal can be transferred, although there\u2019s still a need for a lot more infrastructure and platforms for transacting and handling the assets.\n\nIt has quickly given rise to CryptoPunks clones and playable web games on Bitcoin. OnChain Monkey, an Ethereum project, also put its entire 10,000 NFT original collection into a single inscription. However, Ordinals has also drawn considerable backlash from Bitcoin maximalists, plus it has boosted network congestion\u2014and transaction fees in tandem.\n\nOver 100K Ordinals Minted on Bitcoin, Bringing Cheers and Network Congestion\n\nKevin said that they dove into Ordinals as soon as it started gaining steam. But with the DeGods inscriptions, they didn\u2019t just want to mint them in the typical way and have the inscriptions added to the network across potentially multiple Bitcoin blocks.\n\nInstead, they worked with a Bitcoin miner, Luxor Technologies CEO Nick Hansen, to arrange for all 535 of the NFT inscriptions to be etched onto the blockchain in a single, exclusive block. The block was processed by DMG Blockchain Solutions\u2019 Terra Pool, which claims to be a carbon-neutral mining pool powered by renewable energy solutions.\n\nOver 1 year ago, 535 DeGods were burned. Many have speculated on their return. What is dead may never die. pic.twitter.com/fmP1FhZI6F \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 13, 2023\n\n\u201cIt was a deal-breaker for us if we couldn't do it as a custom block, because we had to do something special,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt\u2019s the DeGods way, right? You can't just do it in the basic way. You\u2019ve gotta do something that feels really fresh.\u201d\n\nUltimately, to fit the 535 images into a single Bitcoin block, they had to be seriously compressed. Each was resized down to a low-resolution 210x210 pixels\u2014a nod to the total Bitcoin supply of 21 million BTC\u2014and in the .webp file format to conserve space. But now they\u2019re all inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain for future use.\n\nWhile many NFTs on Ethereum and other platforms store their artwork externally on either centralized servers or decentralized storage solutions (like IPFS), Ordinals fit the artwork or asset entirely within the on-chain block. That proved to be a key part of the appeal for the DeGods team\u2014that these assets will live potentially forever on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI've run a [Bitcoin] node, and the idea that every single node on the planet is now verifying and backing up this image is so powerful,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat is what got us really excited.\u201d\n\nNext steps\n\nMeanwhile, the broader DeGods project is already set to be bridged from Solana to Ethereum sometime this quarter, as announced in December\u2014with sister project y00ts bridging from Solana to Polygon.\n\nThat\u2019s still happening for the rest of the project\u2019s 10,000 total NFTs, and Frank tweeted this week that \u201chaving a presence on all blockchains is important.\u201d However, these 535 specific DeGods NFTs, which were previously burned on Solana, will only live on Bitcoin via Ordinals.\n\nHow they roll out remains to be seen, however. The official DeGods account tweeted Monday that details on how to mint the Bitcoin NFTs will be announced \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Kevin told Decrypt that they\u2019re currently being held in private wallets, and that they\u2019re waiting for more tooling to be deployed to make Ordinals safer to handle and transact. Once that target is hit, Kevin said that they have plenty of ideas on how to launch the NFTs in an effort to \u201ccome back to our holders and support the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're gonna essentially sit on them,\u201d Kevin said, \u201cuntil we are comfortable that the tooling will support the proper custody of these for a reasonably sophisticated crypto connoisseur.\u201d"

The company explained that inscribing NFTs through its software involves \u201cno need to run a node, complex software, or anything else,\u201d merely some Bitcoin to pay a transaction fee, which can be bought directly through the app.\n\nInscriptions are made via Gamma.io, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace that rolled out \u201cno-code ordinal inscriptions\u201d last week. According to Xverse, roughly 5% of Bitcoin inscriptions so far have been made using Gamma\u2019s tool.\n\nAfter uploading an image and sending a transaction to their provided Ordinals address, users can find their inscriptions inside their Xverse NFT collection within 20 to 30 minutes\u2014and embedded in the blockchain forever.\n\nOver 100K Ordinals Minted on Bitcoin, Bringing Cheers and Network Congestion\n\nThis comes just a day after Hiro, another Bitcoin focused Web3 wallet, rolled out inscriptions to its testnet on Tuesday. Both wallets interact with Stacks, a \u201clayer 1.5\u201d blockchain with its own NFT economy that settles its transactions on Bitcoin.\n\nXverse, too, lets Bitcoin users interact with Stacks, with plans to introduce instant payments via the lightning network.\n\nBitcoin recently logged its 100,000th Ordinals transaction, continuing a trend of exponential growth. Given that NFTs on Bitcoin were not a feature envisioned by its original developers, their existence has naturally sparked controversy, with many people unsure of whether they will hurt or help the network.\n\nStacks co-creator Muneeb Ali said he welcomes the new protocol, stating that it marks a \u201cnew chapter in Bitcoin history\u201d on Tuesday. The following day, he said that Xverse\u2019s Bitcoin wallet now has the \u201ceasiest on-ramp to ordinals.\u201d\n\nKen Liao, the founder and CEO of Xverse wallet (aka Secret Key Labs), said that the ability to send out one\u2019s ordinal from the wallet will be available soon.

        "content": "Last year, bitcoin moved in tandem with the stock market as well as the bond market as inflation applied downward pressure to most assets. In the recent rally, bitcoin is doing the same, tailing indexes like the Nasdaq 100 as it moves higher amid the anticipation of fewer rate hikes.\n\nThat remains to be seen, however, as the U.S. Federal Reserve could reverse course if it senses that it doesn't quite have inflation under control. If that's the case, more volatility could be ahead for the stock market, which could translate to volatility in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\"On days when technology stocks trade higher, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), are likely to do the same,\" a Coindesk article noted. \"Conversely, a decline in technology stocks could drag the crypto market lower.\"\n\nThat said, macroeconomic catalysts like inflation reports and interest rate decisions are likely to move cryptocurrencies again this year. A peek at the Nasdaq 100 may offer market-watchers an idea of what the cryptocurrency market might be doing.\n\n\"The renewed positive correlation implies increased sensitivity of cryptocurrencies to macroeconomic data releases like the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), which injects volatility into stock markets,\" the article added further. \"The CPI days were among the most volatile for U.S. stocks last year, according to MarketWatch.\"\n\nGet Bitcoin Exposure on a Regulated Exchange\n\nGetting bitcoin exposure doesn't mean that investors must trade digital currencies by opening a separate account on an unregulated cryptocurrency exchange that could potentially open them up to potential risk. That said, investors have options in regulated markets in order to get cryptocurrency exposure to major coins like bitcoin.\n\nExchange traded funds (ETFs) can allow investors to get in on thebitcoin priceaction without investing directly in the digital currency itself.

But while Bitcoin\u2019s core ethos involves peer-to-peer digital payments, some developers have long wondered whether the blockchain could support different functionalities like NFTs or be more programmable, like Ethereum. With the most recent craze to hit the crypto ecosystem, they may finally be getting their answer.\n\nThat craze? Bitcoin NFTs called \u201cOrdinal Inscriptions.\u201d Ordinals involve putting any kind of digital file \u2014 people have minted playable games, videos, and images \u2014 on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, and they have taken off in 2023.\n\nYet, this trend has also generated controversy among some of Bitcoin\u2019s most ardent supporters. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nWhat are Ordinals?\n\nOrdinals are essentially NFTs, but for the Bitcoin blockchain. Like NFTs, they represent digital assets. But instead of being minted, Ordinals are \u201cinscribed\u201d onto a single satoshi (the lowest denomination of BTC, similar to a penny vs. a dollar). Inscribing is the process of putting a piece of data onto the blockchain, where it will remain forever accessible and unchangeable.\n\nOrdinals began rising in popularity at the end of January, and to date more than 160,000 inscriptions have been created, including a playable version of the 1993 video game Doom and a picture of a Bored Ape morphed with a CryptoPunk.\n\nHow are Ordinals different from NFTs on other blockchains?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s blockchain isn\u2019t smart-contract compatible like those of Ethereum and Solana, so it\u2019s more difficult to create applications like games and NFTs via BTC\u2019s network.\n\nOrdinals are also far more technologically limited than traditional NFTs. While they can inscribe most forms of digital content, Ordinals are limited by the size of data that can fit in a BTC block, which is about 4 MB at maximum. Additionally, the barrier to create an inscription is high \u2013 typically one must be running a Bitcoin node to be able to inscribe into a satoshi.\n\nIn an effort to make Ordinals more accessible, however, BTC marketplace Gamma.io recently launched a tool to create a 60kb inscription for 21,000 satoshis (or, sats) which is about $5. And on Wednesday, crypto wallet maker MetaMask released an Ordinal wallet available to its 30 million users.\n\nWhat does the Bitcoin community think of Ordinals?\n\nDetractors in the Bitcoin community, like Adam Back, a prominent developer, believe that inscriptions are a \u201cwaste\u201d because they are consuming blockspace that should be used for financial transactions, which is Bitcoin\u2019s founding, primary purpose. Because inscriptions can contain audio or video files, creating them has increased the cost of transacting on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nOthers argue that because inscribing into satoshis can alter their value, it would cause Bitcoin to lose an important trait that money has \u2014 fungibility \u2014 since all satoshis would no longer have equal value.\n\nAlex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a developer for the Bitcoin smart contract platform Stacks (which has seen its native STK token jump by more than 100% in the last week amid the Bitcoin NFT hype) believes that inscriptions being fundamentally different from traditional NFTs will help spur their adoption \u2014 even if Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain wasn\u2019t originally intended to be used for things like preserving digital versions of housing deeds of government documents.\n\nWhy it matters\u2026 It\u2019s still too early to tell if Ordinals are the beginning of new use-cases for Bitcoin, or just a short-term fad. Will their functionality ultimately be eclipsed by Ethereum\u2019s dominance as a programmable blockchain? Or will they usher in a new era for Bitcoin? People like Miller argue that Ordinals have a real future. \u201cThe Stacks community [has] been saying for so long that things should be getting built on Bitcoin,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBecause it is the most trusted thing that\u2019s been around the longest, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nTAKES\n\nKeanu Reeves praises crypto, the SEC\u2019s Hester Peirce criticizes her agency, and other key soundbites\n\nOrange pill\u2026 \u201cTo pooh-pooh crypto, or the volatility of cryptocurrency, it\u2019s only going to make it better in terms of how it\u2019s safeguarded,\u201d was how \u201cJohn Wick\u201d star Keanu Reeves described crypto technology amid the negative headlines of recent months.

Secure your seat today\n\nBitcoin bolted past $24,000 for the first time in two weeks after surging more than 8% over the past 24 hours, likely the result of the type of short squeeze that historically has sent prices higher. The percentage increase was the largest since BTC jumped 10.5% on Sept. 9.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had dropped below $21,600 at different points in recent days amid growing investor fretfulness about crypto regulation, particularly targeting the stablecoin market, and about future U.S. central bank steps to tame inflation.\n\nBut those concerns seemed to fade quickly as bitcoin surged past $24,100 by the afternoon before retreating slightly.\n\nData from crypto data provider Coinglass showed that traders who bet on price shifts liquidated some $65 million of bitcoin over the past 24 hours, from which about $60 million were in short positions.\n\nCrypto-related stocks also jumped, with both exchange Coinbase (COIN) and bitcoin miner \u200b\u200bMarathon Digital Holdings (MARA) increasing 15%.

        "title": "What Is Bitcoin Mining? - Ledger",
        "content": "What Is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBy Lipsa Das\n\nRead 6 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \u2014 Bitcoin mining is how Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work consensus mechanism confirms and validates transactions through network participants such as miners and nodes.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Miner nodes compete against each other to solve mathematical problems, and the winner of this competition validates the new block and receives block rewards.\n\n\n\n\u2014 You need specialized mining hardware for Bitcoin mining. Beginners can use mining pools (group mining) or cloud mining (renting hardware) to reduce upfront investment.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of adding new transaction blocks to the Bitcoin ledger by miner nodes that solve complex hashing problems and claim newly minted Bitcoins as mining rewards.\n\nHow does Bitcoin Mining work?\n\nBitcoin mining is a central concept of Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which helps \u201cmine\u201d new bitcoins to the system while validating transactions.\n\nAs its name suggests, PoW literally translates to proof of \u201cwork being done\u201d. In this case, that translates to powerful computers crunching the numbers required through sheer computational brute force to validate transactions and produce new bitcoins.\n\nCore to the PoW consensus protocol are two main network participants: miners and nodes. A node is a network computer that provides the first layer of checks to determine whether a transaction is valid. Valid transactions are then added to a memory pool or, in other words, a queue of transactions that don\u2019t have any blocks assigned to them. That\u2019s where miners come in.\n\nMiners compete against each other to find a secret phrase, called \u201cnonce\u201d, which, when combined with the transaction data, grants them the right to validate blocks. The winning miner determines which transactions need to be prioritized for the next block, put them together in a block and add it to the blockchain.\n\nMiners can also function as a node, because they have a copy of all transactions. However, nodes cannot operate as miners.\n\nSince miners need to have a copy of all transactions to do this, they can, by default, operate as a node, but vice versa is not necessary.\n\nWhich Miner Gets To Decide the Next Block?\n\nAs of writing, Bitcoin has over 14,000 miner nodes who compete with each other for the right to add to blocks to the chain, therefore earning the block reward.\n\nThis competition is where things get interesting.\n\nThink of the proof-of-work problems as the combination of a complex safe. You know some of the access codes for the safe, but you have to guess the rest of the digits. And you\u2019ve to do it faster than other people.\n\nIn bitcoin terms, the miner\u2019s computing equipment competes with other miners on the network to guess the nonce. Since there are billions of permutations, it\u2019s a matter of trial and error until a miner guesses the correct one.\n\nThe nonce combines the transaction information in the block to produce an encrypted series of alphanumeric characters, or the \u201chash\u201d. The miner that provides this hash to the Bitcoin network can add the new block to the network. They get rewarded a fixed amount of Bitcoins generated by the system (the block reward).\n\nHow To Be the Miner That Decides the Next Block?\n\nThe quality of your mining hardware makes a huge difference to your effectiveness as a miner. The better the hashrate (computing speed) of your hardware, the more guesses it can compute per second and eliminate incorrect answers quickly.\n\nTherefore, miners who invest in advanced hardware or pool their resources together have a higher chance of guessing the correct nonce faster.\n\nStatistically, though, the probability of the same miner getting it right every time is pretty low, which is good for the network. The more miners the network has, the more decentralized and secure the Bitcoin blockchain is.\n\nWhy Does Bitcoin Need Miners?\n\nBitcoin miners ensure the safety of the network by addressing a problem unique to crypto \u2014 double-spending. Double spending refers to trying to use the same currency more than once.\n\nIn a traditional financial system, this isn\u2019t possible. In the cash economy, you can\u2019t spend the same $100 bill at two places: Simply, once you spend it, since you don\u2019t possess it any longer. With digital transactions too, banks can easily track the flow of funds, since they have a centralized database. In other words, you will never be able to spend the same money twice.\n\nHowever, since Bitcoin is a digital currency with no central authority verifying transactions, the process for tracking your spending (and maintaining accurate records) is distributed across the network.\n\nMiners act as decentralized \u201cbankers\u201d of the Bitcoin network and play a key role in preventing double-spending of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen unconfirmed transactions are pulled out of the memory pool for validation, the transaction with the most confirmations gets added to the block. Accordingly, any other transactions will fail. Typically, if a block gets over six node confirmations, it is valid.\n\nMeanwhile, individual miners themselves are incentivized to confirm transactions accurately and, honestly, the block reward is only valuable as long as the Bitcoin network remains accurate and trustworthy.\n\nWhy Mine Bitcoin?\n\n1. Financial Incentive\n\nAs of 2020, for each block a miner solves, they receive 6.25 Bitcoins as mining rewards. So while mining is not as profitable as it used to be a decade ago, Bitcoin mining is still lucrative.\n\nBitcoin mining profitability, though, depends on various other factors \u2014 electricity bills, the price of Bitcoin, mining competition, etc.\n\n2. Autonomy\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are about autonomy \u2013 they allow you to be your own bank, storing value and transacting independently of a central authority.\n\nMining takes this to the next level. As a miner, you maintain a copy of Bitcoin\u2019s entire transaction history on your computer, so you become your own source of truth.\n\nFurther, mining bitcoin also grants you \u201cvoting power\u201d proportional to the hash rate you commit to the network. Therefore, you can influence fundamental network changes such as forks to the Bitcoin network.\n\n3. Maintaining the Bitcoin Network\n\nBecoming a Bitcoin miner means the satisfaction of knowing you\u2019re preventing manipulation of the Bitcoin network. For those who are enthusiastic about a decentralized monetary system, contributing to its function has a lot of appeal.\n\nHow To Start Mining Bitcoin?\n\nTechnically, anyone can start mining Bitcoin. However, over the years of Bitcoin evolution, the sophistication of bitcoin mining has significantly increased \u2014 going from GPUs (the ones you find in gaming laptops) to mining rigs.\n\nIt\u2019s still possible to mine with a GPU, but you\u2019ll likely earn in pennies even if your hardware runs for months straight. And that is if you\u2019re able to join a mining pool that accepts a low hash rate.\n\nIf you\u2019re going the independent miner route, you\u2019ll need specialized mining hardware, preferably ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit). ASICs are specialized hardware components with fast processing power, ranging from $500 to thousands of dollars.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to handle technical details yourself \u2014 for instance, deciding whether to purchase a secondhand machine, configuring the software that will run your miner, etc.\n\nThis process can quickly become complicated. Two of the simplest ways for beginners to start mining Bitcoin are; mining pools and cloud mining.\n\nWhat Are Mining Pools?\n\nMining pools are groups of cryptocurrency miners who pool their computational resources to solve the proof of work problems and share the rewards of the mined bitcoin. This tackles two problems.\n\nIndependent miners can be up against entire mining farms, which makes your chances of success relatively low as an individual. So pooling your resources with a mining group gives the whole group a better chance of collecting the block reward.\n\nFurther, investing in mining hardware is expensive and has a sunk cost due to hardware deterioration at high temperatures. Mining pools allow you to hack your way into mining success by utilizing the power of the group to solve problems faster.\n\nWith mining pools, miners have a higher probability of securing the prize with lower costs. Of course, in doing so, they have to sacrifice some of the autonomy with respect to mining strategies and a portion of the rewards. But hey \u2014 it\u2019s better than being empty-handed, right?\n\nMining pools come in three types:\n\n1. Proportional Mining Pools\n\nIn proportional mining pools, each miner receives a share proportional to their hardware\u2019s computing power to the entire pool. Once a block is found, the miner receives their payout.\n\n2. Pay-per-share Mining Pools\n\nIn pay-per-share mining pools, each miner receives an instant payout based on the hardware power they have committed to the pool. Here, the pool owner takes on the risk of providing a steady stream of income to miners, even if they do not find a block.\n\n3. Peer-to-peer Mining Pools\n\nPeer-to-peer mining pools take a decentralized approach to mining, where pool decisions are made on the blockchain.\n\nWhat Is Cloud Mining?\n\nCloud Mining extends the concept of cloud computing by allowing users to rent computing power from companies that mine Bitcoin on their behalf.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to how cloud services like Google Drive store and share your files instead of running your own storage server. In cloud mining, you pay the company a fee, they allocate hash power proportional to that fee, and you\u2019re free to use that power to mine your Bitcoins.\n\nThe direct benefit of cloud mining is that you don\u2019t have to worry about buying or maintaining hardware and dealing with storage, electricity, or cooling costs. You also need little to no technical know-how while using cloud computing.\n\nCloud mining is also highly flexible. Depending on the market conditions and your mining strategies, you can scale up or down with a few clicks. Further, since most of these cloud mining companies run large-scale mining operations in inexpensive countries, you typically have access to state-of-the-art equipment at a fraction of the cost.\n\nHowever, involving a third party in mining operations always comes with a risk. It\u2019s important to choose a reliable and transparent cloud mining supplier \u2014 since you don\u2019t own any hardware and are entirely dependent on the mining company.\n\nBitcoin Mining Vs Energy Consumption\n\nThe proof-of-work consensus mechanism uses energy as the key resource for securing itself.\n\nAll miners use energy as they compete to solve the hash puzzle, but only one miner gets to add each new block; thus, energy expenditure by other miners serves purely to prevent a bad actor from manipulating the validation process, which in turn preserves the value of Bitcoin.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin energy consumption is one of the core debates in the crypto space. But to fully grasp the \u201ccost/benefit analysis\u201d of Proof of Work, the facts must also be considered in context.\n\nYes, Bitcoin does consume significant energy; but doing so guarantees the security of the system and, therefore the value of the currency as a whole. This is what allows it to pose an alternative to centralized banking, something that brings enormous possibilities in itself.\n\nEnergy consumption remains a hotly-debated issue. However, as long as Bitcoin continues to function effectively and securely as a decentralized ledger, there\u2019s a valid argument to be made in favor of Proof of Work.\n\nReady to Start Mining Bitcoin?\n\nMining bitcoin is a lucrative option for many people, but it takes some planning to make it a success.\n\nFor instance, you should do a cost-benefit analysis of mining Bitcoin relative to its price. Take into account the full stack infrastructure needed to run your mining operations profitably\u2014 mining hardware, energy costs, book-keeping, tax implications, accounting, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Bitcoin and mining, starting with a lower-end investment like cloud mining or mining pools would make sense. Test the waters before you go all in.\n\nLet\u2019s get mining!\n\nKnowledge is power"

        "content": "Accept the oddities: Bitcoin's blockchain has more empty blocks than intended.\n\nBitcoin ( BTC ) is a digital currency that is renowned for its durability, security, and dependability. A new block is added to the network on average every ten minutes, and the miner who successfully creates the block is rewarded with 6.25 Bitcoin, which is equivalent to almost $130,000.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bitcoin blockchain is known to sometimes spring a surprise on both watchers and players.\n\nNodes around the network confirmed the existence of a totally empty block at the height of 776,339 blocks. The fact that the block was uploaded to the Bitcoin network with no transactions included caused considerable consternation among those involved in the cryptocurrency industry. What precisely is meant by the term \"empty block,\" and how does this phenomenon occur?\n\nTo begin, while the presence of an empty block on the network may at first seem peculiar, this kind of thing is really rather common. Block 774486 was the location where it happened a little more than two weeks ago to the day.\n\nMiners are encouraged to mine blocks as rapidly as possible, and as a result, they may mine a block even if they have not yet received any transactions that they may include in the block. When this occurs, the block will continue to be empty.\n\nThe following justification may be found in the Bitcoin mempool, which is the primary location for doing research on the Bitcoin blockchain: \"When a new block is located, mining pools will give miners a block template that does not include any transactions. This will allow them to begin the search for the next block as quickly as possible. They immediately transmit a block template that is complete with transactions; but, a complete block template is a larger data transfer and reaches miners after a little longer period of time.\n\n\"During this interim period, which is often no more than one to two seconds, miners sometimes get fortunate and discover a new block utilizing the empty block template,\"\n\nIn essence, mining a template was a case of \"getting fortunate\" for the miners. The Bitcoin block with the height of 776,389 was added to the chain just a few seconds after the block that came before it, which had the height of 776,488. However, Block 776,388 received an additional 0.086 BTC in fees, which is equivalent to around $1,854. This amount was added to the block reward of 6.25 BTC, which is approximately $135,247.\n\nEven when there are no transactions in an empty block, the miner is still rewarded with freshly created bitcoins as part of the block reward. As a result, the reward for Block 776,389 was 6.25 Bitcoin and there were no transaction fees. The winning miner was Binance Pool, which contributed as much as 12% to the overall hash rate of the network.\n\nIt is essential to emphasize the fact that empty blocks do not provide a challenge for the network. Mining empty blocks still results in the production of the coin creation transaction, sometimes referred to as the coinbase transaction. This transaction ensures that Bitcoin is on track to meet its goal of having 21 million Bitcoins in circulation.\n\nThe proportion of vacant blocks on the network is often between between 1% and 2%, as seen by the statistics provided by BitInfoCharts. Given the proliferation of \"ordinals\" on Bitcoin, also known as the capacity to permanently carve photos, data, and marks into the blockchain, this statistic is even more shocking in light of its current state.\n\nThe increase in ordinals has led to various queries and even some anxiety among the Bitcoin community, and only lately the very first cases of pornography were documented.\n\nAs more and more image aficionados compete to have their work included in the Bitcoin blockchain, the mempool has become a more congested place, and block space has become a disputed resource."

        "title": "Bitcoin bulls aim to hold this week's BTC gains leading into Friday's $675M options expiry - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) gained 6.3% just two days after reaching $21,370 on Feb. 13, which was the lowest level seen in more than three weeks. The price recovery can be partially explained by the Feb. 14 U.S. Consumer Price Index data displaying a 6.4% increase in year-over-year inflation in January.\n\nWhile the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to monitor the overheated economy, the most likely scenario is further interest rate hikes to curb inflation. The unintended consequence is the heightened government debt cost, creating a bullish environment for scarce assets such as commodities, stock market and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe price gain of Bitcoin practically extinguished bears\u2019 expectation for a sub-$21,500 options expiry on Feb. 17, so their bets are unlikely to pay off as the deadline approaches.\n\nBitcoin investors\u2019 primary concern is the possibility of further impacts from regulators following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ordering Kraken to halt its staking rewards program on Feb. 9 and the crackdown on Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin issuing on Feb. 13.\n\nEven if the newsflow remains negative, bulls still can profit from Feb. 17\u2019s options expiry by keeping the BTC price above $22,500, but the situation can easily flip and favor bears.\n\nBears were not expecting the $22,000 level to hold\n\nThe open interest for the Feb. 17 options expiry is $675 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were expecting sub-$22,000 price levels. These traders became overconfident after Bitcoin traded below $21,500 on Feb. 13.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Feb. 17. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.12 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $355 million call (buy) open interest and the $320 million put (sell) options. If Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $22,700 at 8:00 am UTC on Feb. 17, only $24 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $21,000 or $22,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nBulls aim for $23,000 to secure a $155 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Feb. 17 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $21,000 and $22,000: 700 calls vs. 5,500 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $100 million.\n\n700 calls vs. 5,500 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $100 million. Between $22,000 and $22,500: 1,800 calls vs. 1,500 puts. The net result is balanced between bears and bulls.\n\n1,800 calls vs. 1,500 puts. The net result is balanced between bears and bulls. Between $22,500 and $23,000: 3,800 calls vs. 1,100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $60 million.\n\n3,800 calls vs. 1,100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $60 million. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 6,900 calls vs. 200 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $155 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price eyes $23K despite US dollar strength hitting 6-week high\n\nBears might benefit from the impact of regulation\n\nBitcoin bulls need to push the price above $23,000 on Feb. 17 to secure a potential $155 million profit. On the other hand, the bears\u2019 best-case scenario requires a 3.5% dump below $22,000 to maximize their gains.\n\nConsidering the negative pressure from regulators, bears have good odds of flipping the table and avoiding a loss of $60 million or larger on Feb. 17.\n\nMore importantly, looking at a broader time frame, there is little room for the Fed to slow down the economy without spiraling the debt interest repayments out of control.\n\nFeb. 17 will be an interesting display of strength between the short-term impact of a hostile crypto regulation environment versus Bitcoin\u2019s long-term scarcity and censorship-resistance benefits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price gained 6.3% just two days after reaching $21,370 on Feb. 13, which was the lowest level seen in more than three weeks. The price recovery can be partially explained by the Feb. 14 U.S. Consumer price index data displaying a 6.4% increase in year-over-year inflation in January.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The coin was trading at about $24,800 as of mid-day Thursday.\n\nThe performance of the most popular cryptocurrency also has lifted the second-leading cryptocurrency, Ether, which was up 8% and hovering near its highest point since September\u2014about $1,700.\n\nChart shows BTC price since Jan. 1, 2023\n\nThe rise in Bitcoin's price could partly be due to the rise of Bitcoin NFTs, called Ordinals, leading to more activity on the blockchain by users not seeking just financial transactions, according to a report from blockchain data company Glassnode. The total non-zero balance addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain are also reached at an all-time high of 44 million.\n\n\u201cThis is a new and unique moment in Bitcoin history, where an innovation is generating network activity without a classical transfer of coin volume for monetary purposes,\u201d Glassnode wrote in the report.\n\nThe recovery in crypto markets comes after a pullback in February following a slate of bad news for the industry.\n\nRecent actions by regulators against crypto exchange Kraken and Paxos have sent shockwaves throughout the ecosystem, and had some questioning the future of crypto companies in the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, January\u2019s consumer price index report saw inflation increase 0.5% for an annual increase of 6.4% to start off 2023. Although that figure is above analysts' expectations, prices had been falling for the past six months, fueled in part by rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, while leading economists have cautioned that 2023 could be a turbulent year for markets, some on Crypto Twitter have optimistically predicted an extended rally after Bitcoin\u2019s most recent pump.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\n\nMillennials\u2019 average net worth: How the nation\u2019s largest working generation stacks up against the rest\n\nThe best 5 ways to earn passive income\n\nThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home\n\n"

        "content": "To get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important crypto stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday at 12 p.m. PT, subscribe here.\n\nWelcome back to Chain Reaction.\n\nThe past few weeks in crypto land have been focused on the latest craze: Ordinals.\n\nWhat are Ordinals, you might ask? They\u2019re NFT-like Bitcoin digital artifacts that are on the blockchain.\n\nWhile the project isn\u2019t the first to try to bring NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, it\u2019s definitely gaining the most traction today.\n\nAbout 122,500 Ordinals have been inscribed, which is jargon for created (or minted), to date, according to Dune Analytics data. The number of total inscriptions is up 40% from about 88,000 on Tuesday. On February 8, the number of Ordinals inscribed peaked over 21,000, and Wednesday was the second highest day with over 17,7000, the data showed.\n\n\u201cIt has really escaped, it\u2019s gone nuclear,\u201d Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, shared with TechCrunch. \u201cThere are people building things that I don\u2019t even hear about until they\u2019ve launched. So it\u2019s really about where people want to take this.\u201d\n\nAlthough things have started off strong, time will tell on whether or not the project will continue to grow and compete with major NFT ecosystems on chains like Ethereum and Solana.\n\nMore below.\n\nThis week in web3\n\nOrdinals creator views his Bitcoin-centric creation as digital artifacts, not just NFTs (TC+)\n\nTechCrunch sat down with the Ordinals creator to discuss the inspiration for the NFT-like Bitcoin project that is expanding rapidly. \u201cI thought I was building something good and I thought I was meeting an unmet market demand that NFT collectors had expressed a desire for,\u201d Rodarmor said. And by the current market\u2019s response, his creation did in fact meet that demand.\n\nCrypto exchange Binance expects to pay penalties to settle US investigations\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, expects to pay monetary penalties to settle probes into its business in the U.S., a top executive said, in a major about-face after publicly disputing the idea that it was under any investigation and mocking media outlets that reported otherwise. In an apparent admission of breaking laws, Binance chief strategy officer Patrick Hillmann told the WSJ that the company\u2019s executives were unfamiliar with laws and rules written surrounding bribery, corruption and money laundering.\n\nBitcoin NFTs are growing quickly as community sees long-term potential (TC+)\n\nFollowing the theme of Ordinals, TechCrunch also spoke to a handful of experts on what Ordinals\u2019 growth means for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Even though Ordinals and Bitcoin NFTs in general are exploding, it\u2019s still in very early stages, especially when compared to behemoths like Ethereum and Solana. \u201cIf Bitcoin wants to stay the most decentralized, widespread and prolific cryptocurrency, it needs something like [Bitcoin NFTs] to push it forward,\u201d Alex Adelman, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin-rewards platform Lolli, said.\n\nSEC\u2019s proposal could affect which crypto companies can manage assets (TC+)\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a new rule on Wednesday that may back crypto companies further into a corner as regulators continue to crack down on the space. The SEC voted 4-1 for a proposal that would direct registered investment advisers (RIAs) \u2014 like wealth managers or hedge funds \u2014 to keep customers\u2019 money and securities with qualified custodians like a bank, broker-dealer or trust company when storing digital assets, mainly leaving crypto companies on the outskirts.\n\nWant to buy an NFT with your credit card? Magic Eden lets you do just that (TC+)\n\nOne of the biggest complaints in the crypto world is that using the technology is, you know, kind of difficult. But as the ecosystem evolves, many big players are trying to alleviate the issue through new on-ramps or payment solutions. MoonPay, a web3 infrastructure company, has joined forces with Magic Eden, one of the biggest NFT marketplaces, to help make NFTs more accessible through old-school tricks, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nThe latest pod\n\nWe released a fun bonus episode this week, which dives into TechCrunch\u2019s newest podcast: Inside Startup Battlefield, which is a four-part series that takes you behind the Startup Battlefield competition.\n\nFor last week\u2019s episode, Jacquelyn talked to Gwendolyn Regina, investment director at layer-1 blockchain BNB Chain. Prior to her current role, Gwen worked at Facebook, or as some call it now, Meta, building up a new business unit for venture capital partnerships and startup growth. She\u2019s also a founder of a few different businesses and a founding team member for early-stage tech investment firm Thymos Capital.\n\nBNB Chain was launched in 2020 and initially kicked off by Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. Since then, BNB Chain aims to be a decentralized, community-owned separate entity from Binance with a focus on three audiences: retail markets, builders and developers, and bridging Web 2.0 businesses to web3, Regina shared.\n\nGaming on BNB Chain also has grown \u201corganically through robustness and cheaper fees,\u201d but the blockchain\u2019s team is now \u201cdoubling down\u201d in that sector to encourage more gamers and developers to play and build on its chain, Regina added.\n\nWe also discussed:\n\nThe dApps developers are building on-chain\n\nBNB\u2019s investing strategy\n\nWhat investors look for in founders\n\nAdvice to startups launching in a bear market\n\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\n\nFollow the money\n\nStelo Labs raises $6 million in a16z-led round to help crypto wallet users protect themselves Crypto index platform Alongside raises $11 million led by a16z Monad Labs raises $19 million to grow its smart contract platform and improve the Ethereum space Caldera raises $9 million from two rounds led by Sequoia and Dragonfly Capital Ironblocks raises $7 million to protect decentralized finance and web3 from threats and theft\n\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting."

        "title": "'Bitcoin Is the Best Brand in Crypto': Why DeGods NFTs Are Now on Bitcoin - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin NFTs via Ordinals are the buzziest thing in the space lately, with more than 100,000 such media assets committed to the blockchain in barely two weeks. Surprisingly, that tally includes 535 NFTs from DeGods\u2014the most valuable Solana NFT project.\n\nDeGods revealed the move on Monday as word circulated that the profile pictures (PFPs) had all been inscribed on Bitcoin in a single block. (\"Inscribing\" is the process by which NFT-like assets are created on the Bitcoin blockchain, akin to \"minting\" on Ethereum.) The 535 particular images were originally released via Solana in 2021, but were \u201cburned\u201d (or permanently destroyed) to cut down the supply in the early days of the project.\n\nProject creator Rohun Vora, who goes by the pseudonym Frank, told Decrypt that he and Dust Labs CEO Kevin Henrikson (who simply goes by Kevin) are longtime Bitcoin aficionados who relished the opportunity to bring the project onto the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s network in the early days of Ordinals momentum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAesthetics matter a lot to my team @DeGodsNFT. It was an honor working with @hash_bender to make sure there was no random trashy Ordinals minted in between all 535 DeGods. All in one block. Simple. Beautiful. Inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain forever. pic.twitter.com/Yfuvc8IDuT \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 14, 2023\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the best brand in crypto\u2014just as pristine as it gets,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt's the most well known, and truly as simple but powerful as it can get. And the mission statement is it's never been corrupted, right? It's like global sound money. That is so powerful. Aligning ourselves with the best brand in crypto is a no-brainer at any given point in time.\u201d\n\nNow those 535 PFPs have gained a second life on Bitcoin with never-before-seen upgraded artwork. DeGods previously provided holders refreshed \u201cDeadGods\u201d artwork last year, and created upgraded artwork for the burned NFTs as well, plotting an eventual revival.\n\n\u201cWe always had this notion of \u2018What is dead may never die,\u2019\u201d Kevin explained, echoing the familiar refrain from the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\" \u201cAnd it was this idea, like: Holy shit, this is so perfect. We can literally bring these back, mint them as Ordinals on BTC, and it's permanent,\u201d he said.\n\nBack to life\n\nOrdinals is a unique way of inscribing NFT-like media and assets to the Bitcoin blockchain by connecting them with a single Satoshi, or 1/100,000,000th of one BTC. The media is fully stored on-chain and the Ordinal can be transferred, although there\u2019s still a need for a lot more infrastructure and platforms for transacting and handling the assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt has quickly given rise to CryptoPunks clones and playable web games on Bitcoin. OnChain Monkey, an Ethereum project, also put its entire 10,000 NFT original collection into a single inscription. However, Ordinals has also drawn considerable backlash from Bitcoin maximalists, plus it has boosted network congestion\u2014and transaction fees in tandem.\n\nKevin said that they dove into Ordinals as soon as it started gaining steam. But with the DeGods inscriptions, they didn\u2019t just want to mint them in the typical way and have the inscriptions added to the network across potentially multiple Bitcoin blocks.\n\nInstead, they worked with a Bitcoin miner, Luxor Technologies CEO Nick Hansen, to arrange for all 535 of the NFT inscriptions to be etched onto the blockchain in a single, exclusive block. The block was processed by DMG Blockchain Solutions\u2019 Terra Pool, which claims to be a carbon-neutral mining pool powered by renewable energy solutions.\n\nOver 1 year ago, 535 DeGods were burned. Many have speculated on their return. What is dead may never die. pic.twitter.com/fmP1FhZI6F \u2014 Frank III (@frankdegods) February 13, 2023\n\n\u201cIt was a deal-breaker for us if we couldn't do it as a custom block, because we had to do something special,\u201d Frank told Decrypt. \u201cIt\u2019s the DeGods way, right? You can't just do it in the basic way. You\u2019ve gotta do something that feels really fresh.\u201d\n\nUltimately, to fit the 535 images into a single Bitcoin block, they had to be seriously compressed. Each was resized down to a low-resolution 210x210 pixels\u2014a nod to the total Bitcoin supply of 21 million BTC\u2014and in the .webp file format to conserve space. But now they\u2019re all inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain for future use.\n\nWhile many NFTs on Ethereum and other platforms store their artwork externally on either centralized servers or decentralized storage solutions (like IPFS), Ordinals fit the artwork or asset entirely within the on-chain block. That proved to be a key part of the appeal for the DeGods team\u2014that these assets will live potentially forever on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI've run a [Bitcoin] node, and the idea that every single node on the planet is now verifying and backing up this image is so powerful,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat is what got us really excited.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNext steps\n\nMeanwhile, the broader DeGods project is already set to be bridged from Solana to Ethereum sometime this quarter, as announced in December\u2014with sister project y00ts bridging from Solana to Polygon.\n\nThat\u2019s still happening for the rest of the project\u2019s 10,000 total NFTs, and Frank tweeted this week that \u201chaving a presence on all blockchains is important.\u201d However, these 535 specific DeGods NFTs, which were previously burned on Solana, will only live on Bitcoin via Ordinals.\n\nHow they roll out remains to be seen, however. The official DeGods account tweeted Monday that details on how to mint the Bitcoin NFTs will be announced \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Kevin told Decrypt that they\u2019re currently being held in private wallets, and that they\u2019re waiting for more tooling to be deployed to make Ordinals safer to handle and transact. Once that target is hit, Kevin said that they have plenty of ideas on how to launch the NFTs in an effort to \u201ccome back to our holders and support the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're gonna essentially sit on them,\u201d Kevin said, \u201cuntil we are comfortable that the tooling will support the proper custody of these for a reasonably sophisticated crypto connoisseur.\u201d"

        "title": "Ordinals creator views his Bitcoin-centric creation as \u2018digital artifacts,\u2019 not just NFTs - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Ordinals, a Bitcoin-based NFT-like project, has expanded significantly over the past two weeks, but its creator, Casey Rodarmor, said he had no idea it would explode.\n\n\u201cI thought I was building something good and I thought I was meeting an unmet market demand that NFT collectors had expressed a desire for,\u201d Rodarmor told TechCrunch.\n\nBy the current market\u2019s response, his creation did in fact meet that demand.\n\nAbout 122,500 Ordinals have been inscribed, which is jargon for created (or minted), to date, according to Dune Analytics data. The number of total inscriptions is up 40% from about 88,000 on Tuesday. On February 8, the number of Ordinals inscribed peaked over 21,000, and Wednesday was the second highest day with over 17,7000, the data showed.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been somewhat divided on whether NFTs on its blockchain are a good thing. While many see them as a positive, fun way to further grow its ecosystem, some \u201cBitcoin maximalists\u201d oppose them for taking up block space on the network and making transaction fees more expensive, among other things.\n\n\u201cMy theory on why this blew up is that [the community] saw this controversy, but then they saw exactly what they wanted \u2014 on-chain, immutable NFTs that are there forever. Like, fuck yeah, sign me up,\u201d Rodarmor said.\n\nRodarmor\u2019s Genesis inscription, which is the first Ordinal inscription \u2014 or inscription 0 \u2014 was some \u201ctiny pixel art\u201d of a skull that marked the beginning of it all, he said. The image was timestamped on December 14, according to the Ordinals website. It pays homage to the first block to be mined on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is commonly known as the Genesis Block. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple, but I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d he added.\n\nThe second inscription, inscription 1, was made three days later. It an image of the infamous CryptoDickbutts NFT. No, that\u2019s not a typo.\n\nRodarmor is a long-time Bitcoiner and programmer artist. He said he\u2019s made art using code in the past, but it was always a hobby before he created Ordinals. In 2021, when NFTs started gaining interest, he saw the space as something he wanted to dive into, \u201ceven as a hardcore Bitcoiner who saw altcoins as uninteresting,\u201d he joked.\n\nIn early 2022, Rodarmor decided he would figure out a way to create NFTs on top of Bitcoin\u2019s chain. \u201cSo I came up with Ordinals, or Ordinal theory, when I\u2019m being tongue-in-cheek.\u201d\n\nWhile the project isn\u2019t the first to try to bring NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, it\u2019s definitely gaining the most traction today. Counterparty, for instance, was the first platform to inscribe NFTs on Bitcoin\u2019s network with the Rare Pepe collection in 2014. Although Rare Pepe didn\u2019t do much to boost mass demand, one of its NFTs from 2016 sold for $3.6 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction about a year ago.\n\nOrdinals are a \u201csimple concept\u201d that essentially gives individual satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin (equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin), an identity and allows them to be tracked across transactions. The name derives from ordinal numbers, a common term in mathematics, he said.\n\nAnd what\u2019s the identity? These Bitcoin NFTs \u2014 or digital artifacts (as he prefers to call them) \u2014 live on-chain forever.\n\nRodarmor shared that he got the name inspiration for digital artifacts from ChatGPT when he couldn\u2019t figure out what to call them. \u201cI was sitting there asking ChatGPT what word would you call an NFT, digital collectible, that could also be a trading card or a 15th-century digital equivalent of a Chinese silk fan.\u201d\n\nChatGPT replied with \u201cdigital artifact,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, fuck yes, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nWhile inscriptions are technically NFTs, Rodarmor prefers the term digital artifacts \u201cbecause there\u2019s a broader category of NFTs, but inscriptions are a subset of NFTs that don\u2019t do certain things,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s like all inscriptions are digital artifacts and also NFTs, but not all NFTs are digital artifacts.\u201d\n\nWhat makes inscriptions stand out from NFTs? Security, immutability, decentralization and homogeneity, among other subtle characteristics, Rodarmor said.\n\n\u201cOrdinal theory is like a lens that you can view the Bitcoin blockchain through, and when you view it through that lens, these trackable satoshis pop into view like Pok\u00e9mon in the tall grass,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cThat was what I needed, because I needed something where content could live as an artist.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make digital artifacts and then the inscriptions came as a way to add content to those trackable sets,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cThen that is what inscriptions became; that\u2019s the story.\u201d\n\nBut Rodarmor said the story isn\u2019t fully formed.\n\n\u201cThe short-term goal is to protect users and draw the line in the sand,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cI think that it\u2019s very important to protect against scams.\u201d\n\nThe project is currently fully open sourced, so in order for it to continue to scale, there need to be more developers, Rodarmor noted. \u201cI have not taken any outside investment or made any promises, but I\u2019m trying to scale an open source development organization to shepherd the technology and protocol.\u201d\n\nDown the line, there\u2019s a chance that Ordinals could become a for-profit corporation, he said. \u201cI need a corporation to serve as a legal liability shield for the website. So I don\u2019t want anybody to be surprised if there\u2019s going to be a corporation \u2014 and that corporation may grow in scope as appropriate.\u201d\n\nBut for the foreseeable future, scaling Ordinals will be all about improving its technology, education and helping others learn about it. \u201cThat\u2019s really going to drive the growth,\u201d Rodarmor said.\n\nOther community members have spoken out about the importance of infrastructure being built around the project, too. Many inscriptions are being completed manually rather than through a service like an NFT marketplace. Although some services have popped up in response to the sudden demand, the infrastructure is still extremely nascent and not bulletproof.\n\nAccessibility is the \u201cnorth star for all of this right now,\u201d Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor, previously told TechCrunch. Over time, there will be more users and more products focused on expanding the Bitcoin NFT \u2014 or digital artifact \u2014 ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt has really escaped; it\u2019s gone nuclear,\u201d Rodarmor said. \u201cThere are people building things that I don\u2019t even hear about until they\u2019ve launched. So it\u2019s really about where people want to take this.\u201d\n\nRodarmor said he sees it as a \u201ccredibly neutral social layer\u201d for the world. \u201cYou can put data on there, and it might not be to some people\u2019s taste, but it\u2019s pretty hard to censor it. People can use it as a sort of distributed publishing platform in addition to this with content you can own.\u201d\n\nWhile Rodarmor shared that he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in store for the long run, he believes that it will continue to grow as a \u201cvery powerful concept.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d he added. \u201cCome use bitcoin. The water is warm.\u201d"

Munger said claims cryptocurrencies can replace national currencies are the equivalent of saying that air can be replaced.\n\n\"It isn't even slightly stupid, it's massively stupid, and of course it's very dangerous, and of course the governments were totally wrong to permit it,\" Munger told CNBC's Becky Quick during a livestream of the event.\n\n\"And of course, I am not proud of my country for allowing this crap \u2014 well, I call it crypto shit. It's worthless, it's crazy, it's not good, it'll do nothing but harm, it's antisocial to allow it.\"\n\n\"I think the people that oppose my position are idiots,\" the 99-year-old Munger said when asked about his recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal calling for a ban on the asset class. \"And so I don\u2019t think there is a rational argument against my position.\"\n\nMunger, who has drawn criticism for praising the Chinese government in the past, said the nation's leaders were right not to allow cryptocurrencies.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Average Block Size Hits All-Time Highs - Blockchain.News",
        "content": "The average Bitcoin block size has reached record highs after Bitcoin NFT Ordinals protocol launched.\n\nBecause to the introduction of the nonfungible tokens (NFTs) protocol Ordinals in January 2023, the average size of a Bitcoin block has surpassed 2.5 megabytes (MB) for the first time since the cryptocurrency's foundation in 2009. This marks a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to statistics obtained from Blockchain.com, the size of Bitcoin blocks increased by more than 2 MB in the weeks after the debut of the Ordinals Protocol. This surge in block size can be traced back to the beginning of February 2023.\n\nSoftware developer Casey Rodarmor introduced the Ordinals protocol in the month of January. This protocol makes it possible for users of the Bitcoin network to create \"digital artifacts.\" These may include JPEG photographs, PDF documents, as well as audio and video files.\n\nIn the documentation for Ordinals, Rodarmor explains that each of these digital objects may be inscribed to a single satoshi, which is one of the component parts of a Bitcoin. The value of one bitcoin is equal to 100,000,000 satoshis.\n\nIndividual satoshis have the ability to be imprinted with any kind of data, allowing for the creation of one-of-a-kind digital artifacts that are original to Bitcoin. These artifacts may be stored in bitcoin wallets and moved via bitcoin transactions. The permanence, immutability, security, and decentralization of inscriptions are on par with those of Bitcoin itself.\n\nThe Bitcoin community is split on the issue of whether or not it should be possible to engrave digital items into the blockchain , and the reasons both for and against the proposal provide plenty of material for reflection. The greater use of block space for the inscription of several Ordinals has emerged as one of the primary topics of discussion.\n\nSince July 2021 and continuing until February 2023, the typical size of a Bitcoin block has ranged between 0.7 and 1.5 megabytes. The average size of a Bitcoin block topped 2 megabytes for the first time on February 5, and it is now hovering at around 2.2 megabytes at the time of this writing.\n\nAccording to statistics obtained by Glassnode, the introduction of Bitcoin Ordinals has also resulted in the network reaching a new high of 44 million non-zero addresses.\n\nThe most recent issue of Glassnode's newsletter mentions that Ordinals compete for block space demand despite the fact that they have not yet materially influenced network pricing.\n\nThe introduction of Ordinals was referred to as a \"new and unique point in the history of Bitcoin\" by Glassnode. This is because innovation may promote network activity even without the \"classical transfer of currency volume for monetary objectives.\""

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin today broke above $25,000 for the first time since June last year.\n\nIt has since dropped slightly: right now, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is trading hands for $24,914, according to CoinGecko data. That\u2019s a 9.2% 24-hour jump.\n\nThe asset took the rest of the market with it\u2014seemingly unfazed by a U.S. regulatory crackdown. The total market capitalization for all crypto assets has jumped by roughly $100 billion over the last day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum, the second largest digital asset, is up 8.4% in the past day, priced in at $1,717. Dogecoin, the 10th biggest, jumped 4.6% and is now valued at $0.09.\n\nBut why is this happening? It\u2019s hard to say but experts who spoke with Decrypt said the regulatory crackdown might actually be playing a part.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hit American crypto exchange Kraken with a $30 million fine, and reports emerged this week that the regulator was also preparing to sue stablecoin provider Paxos.\n\nMeanwhile, the world\u2019s biggest digital asset exchange Binance said yesterday it would likely pay fines to settle SEC investigations.\n\nWhite Lion Capital CIO John Nance told Decrypt that although it was hard to be certain, with \u201ccrypto getting attacked from all angles,\u201d investors may be selling alt-coins and increasing Bitcoin holdings because it is \u201cbecoming more clear that the safest place in crypto is pure BTC.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill added that Hong Kong\u2019s plans to become an Asian crypto hub might be contributing to the price rise as Asian investors plug money into the space.\n\nBitcoin is still well below its November 2021 all-time high of $69,044\u201463% lower. The cryptocurrency has typically been correlated with the U.S. stock market as investors have lumped it into the \u201crisk-on\u201d asset class.\n\nAs the U.S. Federal Reserve has continually raised interest rates to get sky-high inflation under control, the cryptocurrency market\u2014and tech stocks\u2014have experienced a brutal sell-off. Sentiment on this front may be beginning to shift, however, as the Fed eases off from its aggressive posture."

Such a chart pattern was seen in December 2007, ahead of the global economic crisis.\n\nSimilarly, the ETH/BTC\u2019s previous death cross, in May, preceded an approximately 27.5% price correction, dropping in part as investors reduced exposure to altcoins and sought safety in Bitcoin amid the Terra collapse.\n\nETH/BTC daily price chart.

        "content": "El Salvador is one of the most extreme examples of how the world\u2019s riskiest government bonds have recovered after being over-sold last year\n\nBloomberg \u2014 For most of the four years since taking office, El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele has relished his role as an anti-establishment warrior.\n\nHe sacked judges, exited a regional anti-corruption pact, spurned the International Monetary Fund and adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. All the while, he seemed wholly indifferent to what foreign investors thought of him.\n\nIt turns out, the brash, ball-cap-backwards 41-year-old president is a hit with Wall Street.\n\nSalvadoran debt is the best performer in emerging markets this year after Lebanon. Even after a pullback this week, the notes have returned 19%, compared to a 2.3% average for other developing nations, according to a Bloomberg sovereign bond index.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nVIEW + Nayib Bukele Says El Salvador Paid Full $800 Million of Maturing Foreign Bond El Salvador\u2019s foreign bonds rallied an average of 24% this month as the maturity date approached, according to data compiled by Bloomberg\n\nEl Salvador is one of the most extreme examples of how the world\u2019s riskiest government bonds have recovered after being over-sold last year by money managers who expected a wave of defaults. But it\u2019s also a sign of how investors have warmed to Bukele. Instead of concerns about him running the economy into the ground, they are gushing about his embrace of fiscal prudence and largely looking beyond his autocratic tendencies.\n\nRally in El Salvador's Dollar Bonds | Investors are warming to the country's debt after Bukele paid back a bond in Jan.\n\nThe change in tone started when El Salvador repaid $800 million of bonds that matured last month and repurchased US$452 million of debt due in 2025, making good on repeated promises that the nation would meet its obligations. While there\u2019s still some skepticism on where Bukele will take the country of 6 million, for now, he\u2019s no longer the risk he once was.\n\n\u201cWe went from skepticism, from looking at the numbers and hearing his announcement of paying down the bond, to basically being surprised in a good way by his very strong willingness to pay,\u201d said Federico Kaune, head of emerging-markets fixed income at UBS Asset Management in New York.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nFor the last seven months bonds have been reversing a drop that began when El Salvador adopted Bitcoin alongside the US dollar as its currencies. Bukele has continued to ride the cyrptocurrency, even as its value plummeted more than 40% over the past year. This week, his government said it would open its second \u201cBitcoin embassy,\u201d this one in Texas.\n\nVIEW + True or False: Is Crypto Collapse a Real Risk for El Salvador\u2019s Economy? As cryptocurrencies are falling triggered by interest rates, Bloomberg L\u00ednea explains what is true and what is unclear about how it affects El Salvador\n\nBukele managed to spark a bond rally in July when he announced the buyback even as Bitcoin plunged. The remainder of the notes maturing in 2025 have surged to 74 cents on the dollar after trading as low as 28 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWe love his willingness to pay back,\u201d said Christine Reed, Latin America regional specialist at asset management firm Ninety One in New York.\n\nThere are plenty of potential pitfalls ahead. Reed says El Salvador is unlikely to be able to generate enough reserves to carry out more buy backs in the future, while Kaune calls it a risky investment, troubled by a high debt load and questions over its fiscal outlook.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nAnother source of concern is Bukele\u2019s hard-line approach to crime. Organizations including Human Rights Watch and the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights have criticized his policies as authoritarian and dehumanizing. He has also tangled with the US, which has sanctioned some former government officials and condemned a decision to remove the attorney general and five top judges.\n\nVIEW + El Salvador\u2019s Bukele to Seek Reelection in 2024 Despite Second-Term Prohibition The country\u2019s Constitution prohibits a second term, but the current president could stand in 2024 by taking advantage of a loophole in the law and resigning six months before the elections\n\nThe government did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. On Twitter, Bukele has taken note of how he defied widespread expectations that El Salvador wouldn\u2019t pay the bonds, saying international news outlets had written hundreds of articles predicting the nation would default in January.\n\nFor now, investors have largely shrugged off concerns about Bukele\u2019s policies \u2014 his hard-handed approach to crime has actually helped the economic outlook. Gross domestic product grew at a robust pace in 2022 due to the \u201cunprecedented reduction in crime, and strong remittances and tourism revenues,\u201d according to a statement by the IMF after an official staff visit Feb. 8.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\nThe fiscal deficit is narrowing as well, closing last year at 4.6% of GDP, down from from 5.6% in 2021, according to Fitch Ratings data.\n\n\u201cYou can see that they\u2019ve already tightened the belt with the fiscal spending,\u201d said Oren Barack, managing director of fixed income at New York-based AGP Alliance Global Partners. \u201cIt was never about willingness to pay it was about ability to pay. Now the two have converged.\u201d\n\nVIEW + El Salvador\u2019s Bukele Has Mixed Track Record Midway Through His Mandate Three years into a presidency marked by the Covid-19 pandemic, Nayib Bukele has brought change to the Central American country, but also faces many challenges\n\nRead more at Bloomberg.com"

        "content": "The two largest creditors of Mt. Gox, the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange that got hacked in 2014 \u2014 leading to the loss of 850,000 BTC \u2014 have chosen an early lump sum payment option that will not require a selloff of their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe payment is scheduled for September 2023, CoinDesk reported Feb. 16.\n\nWhile the option to wait for all Mt. Gox litigation to settle may offer higher payouts, it could take another 5-9 years, as per sources. Opting for the early payout will allow the creditors to receive their payments sooner and avoid any potential market impact that could result from a large-scale Bitcoin sell-off.\n\nAccording to sources, the two largest creditors of Mt. Gox, the cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed due to a hack nearly a decade ago, have chosen to receive their bankruptcy recovery in mostly bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThese creditors, Bitcoinica, a now-defunct New Zealand-based crypto exchange, and MtGox Investment Funds (MGIF), which collectively account for about one-fifth of all Mt. Gox claims, will receive 90% of their recoverable funds, which are estimated to be around 21% of their original holdings on the platform at the time of the hack.\n\nIn 2014, hackers stole 850,000 BTC, valued at $460 million at the time. Following the hack, Mt. Gox was left with roughly 142,000 BTC, 143,000 bitcoin cash (BCH), and 69 billion Japanese yen.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk sources, creditors who choose the lump sum option can elect to receive their payment in a mix of BTC, BCH, and yen, or they can ask for the entire amount to be given in fiat. By selecting the early payment, Bitcoinica and MGIF have also decided to receive the crypto option, which means that the majority of their payout will be in BTC.\n\nIf creditors decline the early lump sum payout, their only other recourse is to wait for the conclusion of civil rehabilitation litigation, which includes a lawsuit by CoinLab against Mt. Gox\u2019s estate. While this option may yield a slightly higher recovery, creditors have no guarantee that it won\u2019t be potentially lower than the 90% of recoverable holdings guaranteed by the lump sum payout.\n\nAdditionally, a legal analysis by a Japanese law firm indicated that holdouts could wait many years for their money to be returned.\n\nCreditors must decide by March 10, 2023, whether to accept the offered early lump sum or continue to wait for a potentially larger payout at an unspecified time in the future.\n\nWith the expected reimbursement now likely only months away, analysts worry that a major sell-off of Bitcoin could follow."

        "title": "Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card Review - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Top perks\n\nThe Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card provides an interesting mix of benefits.\n\nBitcoin rewards\n\nThe main appeal of the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card is right there in the name. It earns Bitcoin on your payments toward purchases you've made.\n\nBitcoin's price has skyrocketed many times over the years, so there's the possibility that your rewards will increase in value. It's worth mentioning the opposite is also true. Since Bitcoin is so volatile, your rewards could very well decrease in value.\n\nAll things considered, Bitcoin rewards are a great way to ease into the world of cryptocurrency. You can build a Bitcoin balance without needing to invest your own money.\n\nCOMPARE TOP PICKS: Best Crypto Credit Cards\n\nUnlimited 1.5% back\n\nThis card earns 1.5% back in Bitcoin when you make payments on your purchases. This is different from most rewards credit cards, which earn rewards when you make purchases. With an Upgrade card, you need to pay for a purchase first before earning rewards on it.\n\nUpgrade takes the cash value of your rewards and uses that to buy Bitcoin. For example, if you pay off a $100 purchase, it buys $1.50 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin purchase doesn't happen right away. After you make a payment, Upgrade will purchase the Bitcoin within one to two statement periods.\n\nNo card fees\n\nThere are no card fees to use the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card. That means:\n\nNo annual fee\n\nNo draw fee, including for purchases and direct deposits to a bank account\n\nNo foreign transaction fee\n\nNo prepayment penalty\n\nThere is a 1.5% transaction fee when you sell your Bitcoin rewards. Since that's the only way to use your rewards, this fee is unavoidable.\n\nREAD MORE: Best No Annual Fee Credit Cards\n\nFixed APR\n\nThis Bitcoin rewards card has a fixed APR (annual percentage rate). Credit cards normally have a variable APR that can change with interest rate trends. With Upgrade, your card's interest rate stays the same. Another nice thing about Upgrade is that it typically offers lower interest rates than credit card issuers.\n\nLEARN MORE: What Is APR?\n\nLenient approval requirements\n\nThe Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card is intended for consumers with average to excellent credit. There aren't many rewards card options for fair/average credit, so if your score is in that range, this Upgrade card is a great choice.\n\nSend money to your bank account\n\nOne of the advantages the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card has over credit cards is that you can use it for cash, not just purchases. If you're ever in need of a loan, you won't need to apply with a lender. You can get a direct deposit to your bank account from your Upgrade card for no additional fees.\n\nIt's not so easy or cheap to get cash from a credit card. Although many credit cards allow you to get cash as a cash advance, it carries an additional fee, and the credit card issuer normally charges a higher interest rate.\n\nLEARN MORE: How Does a Credit Card Cash Advance Work?\n\nFixed payments\n\nAt the end of the billing cycle, Upgrade takes your card's balance and gives you a fixed monthly payment. By paying at least this amount, you'll have the balance paid off by the end of your draw length.\n\nThis is much different than credit cards, where you can make small minimum payments and your balance doesn't have a set end date. Some people prefer the structure that fixed payments provide. If you're one of them, then you'll probably like the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card."

        "title": "'Bit-tendo' prototype offers Bitcoin retro games for bars, conferences - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Play-to-earn retro games with Bitcoin (BTC) payouts may soon be making their way to a bar, conference or meetup near you, according to a Feb. 12 tweet by Zebedee founder Christian Moss. The software is tentatively called \u201cBit-tendo.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Pay to Play & Play to Earn in Super Mario 3 on the original NES! #bitcoin #retrogames #lightningnetwork powered by @zebedeeio and @lnbits\n\n\n\n200 retweets and i'll integrate SONIC\n\n\n\n\"Bit-tendo\" will be a free retro game bitcoin infuser for bars, conferences, meet ups etc pic.twitter.com/4GBuXX9pN2 \u2014 Christian Moss (@MandelDuck) February 12, 2023\n\nThe tweet includes a video of someone playing Super Mario Bros. 3 on a small old-school tube television. The TV displays a QR code at startup and asks for a Bitcoin payment. The game only starts running once the payment is sent.\n\nDuring gameplay, a \u201csats\u201d counter is displayed that apparently counts the number of satoshis the player has won as a reward so far. Satoshis, or sats, are Bitcoin\u2019s smallest divisible unit, representing 0.00000001 BTC each. The display also shows a timer that counts down from 90 seconds to zero. When the timer goes to zero, the game ends, and a new QR code is displayed. A statement at the bottom and top of the image implies that the player can use the QR code to withdraw their sats.\n\nIn the post, Moss said that the software will eventually \u201cbe a free retro game bitcoin infuser for bars, conferences, meet ups etc.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Moss for an explanation of how the software works. He said that it runs on a PC or other device that is able to accept a video feed. The game itself is produced by a real Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console, but the video is altered en route to show the sats counter and timer. The software tracks movements in the video feed to determine if the player has collected a coin and updates the sats counter each time a coin is collected.\n\nMoss said that in order to fund the payout wallet, the bar or club needs to sign up for a custodial wallet with Zebedee or LNbits. The wallet is connected to the Lightning Network in order to enable low transaction fees and fast payments.\n\nRelated: Nigerian innovator launches first active Bitcoin Lightning node in the country\n\nThe Zebedee app is available on the Google Play Store and Apple\u2019s App Store. Screenshots reveal that it has a \u201ctop up\u201d (deposit) and \u201ccash out\u201d (withdrawal) function that can be accessed after the user completes a Know Your Customer verification process.\n\nMoss also explained how he came up with the idea for \u201cBit-tendo.\u201d He said that he tried to get people interested in Bitcoin play-to-earn games at Bitcoin conferences but found that participants preferred to play games they already knew rather than \u201cin-house\u201d designed games. Moss said he hopes to make the software work with any game, not just Super Mario Bros. 3:\n\n\u201cI want to also let the user be able to train the software to recognize events in any game they may have, ultimately making it game-agnostic.\u201d\n\nIn his tweet showing off the software, Moss states that he would integrate Sonic The Hedgehog 2 with it if the post got 200 retweets, which it has since received.\n\nMoss has been an innovator in the blockchain gaming space since its inception. In 2014, he created Sarutobi, a game that allowed players to collect Bitcoin by controlling a monkey that swung across a jungle landscape. Because it predated the release of EverdreamSoft\u2019s Spells of Genesis beta by approximately one year, Moss\u2019 Sarutobi is considered by some to have been the first blockchain game."

        "title": "How Many Bitcoins Does Satoshi Nakamoto Have? - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto is the creator and the biggest name in Bitcoin, but do we know just how many Bitcoins does Satoshi Nakamoto have, and what are they actually worth?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s worth noting this question is difficult to answer, as we still don\u2019t know for certain whether Satoshi is a single person, a group of individuals, or an entity. Satoshi Nakamoto is simply a pseudonym used to refer to the people, or person who helped develop the software for Bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, Nakamoto is considered to have the most Bitcoins of any cryptocurrency holder. Read on to learn all about the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin wallet.\n\nHow Many Bitcoins Does Satoshi Nakamoto Have?\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is believed to have approximately 1.1 million Bitcoin. However, it\u2019s worth noting this number is only an estimate. It\u2019s difficult to track the Bitcoin owned by Satoshi, because the public wallet addresses belonging to the entity haven\u2019t been fully identified.\n\nThe 1.1 million Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin wallet value comes from a pattern identified in the first two years of the Bitcoin mining trend. The pattern was detected by a chain analyst named Sergio Demian Lerner, the Chief Scientist for RSK Labs, and is best-known as the Patoshi pattern.\n\nIn 2013, Lerner released a study which indicates the vast majority of the initial BTC released was mined by a single individual. According to Lerner\u2019s estimates, a single miner may have processed around 22,000 blocks in the first year of Bitcoin, and may have gathered 1.8 million Bitcoin in total, 1.1 million of which has not been spent.\n\n(Bitslog)\n\nThe Bitcoins Owned by Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nExperts believe the sheer volume of Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin holdings attributed to the entity today are a result of a low hash rate for the cryptocurrency during 2009. Much of the mining which took place in the early days of Bitcoin was likely to be done by Satoshi himself, as many people still weren\u2019t aware of the currency, or how to correctly mine it.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is widely considered to hold the most Bitcoin in the world.\n\nWith more than 1 million Bitcoins attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto today, the entity is considered the largest holder of BTC in the world. Although the number might not seem particularly large at first glance, the Satoshi Nakamoto wallets holding over 1 million Bitcoin account for around 5% of the total number of Bitcoins which can ever be generated.\n\nOnly 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created and mined, meaning Satoshi retains a massive stake in the overall Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\n(Coin Telegraph)\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence Satoshi Nakamoto sold Bitcoin.\n\nThough people claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto have announced they plan on selling some of their BTC to the public, there\u2019s no evidence that this has taken place as of yet. Despite sitting on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin, the Satoshi Nakamoto wallet value hasn\u2019t dropped in recent years.\n\nInterestingly, however, a Satoshi-era wallet did become active and move during 2022, holding around 500 BTC. However, there\u2019s no evidence this wallet actually belongs to the Bitcoin creator.\n\n(Pyments)\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the most productive Bitcoin miner in the world.\n\nAn analysis by Whale Alert, one of the biggest blockchain tracking and analytics companies in the world, found Satoshi may have been one of the most prolific Bitcoin miners of all time. According to the report, a single address (believed to belong to Satoshi) may have mined up to 1,125,150 tokens up to block 54,316 in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n(Whale Alert)\n\nWhat Is Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Net Worth?\n\nThough we have very little information about any official Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin wallet, we can make assumptions about the entity\u2019s net worth, based on the studies into the market.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto may be worth around $42 billion.\n\nCurrently, estimates suggest the net worth of Satoshi Nakamoto may be around $42 billion. This is based on an analysis of the early Bitcoin wallets which are believed to belong to the person or group. These wallets currently hold around 980,000 bitcoins, although it\u2019s believed Satoshi Nakamoto owns more than 1 million BTC in total.\n\nBased on the current value of Bitcoin, the value of around 980,000 BTC would equate to around $43 billion in today\u2019s market.\n\n(Bitslog)\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the 15th wealthiest person in the world.\n\nAs of 2021, Satoshi Nakamoto was also identified as the fifteenth wealthiest person in the world, according to an analysis by the Independent. At the time, the publication valued Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s net worth as being somewhere around $73 billion.\n\n(Independent)\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, any estimates we have of a Satoshi Nakamoto net worth or wallet value are based on speculation and cryptocurrency analysis. We can\u2019t know for certain how much this entity is truly worth without getting a clear view of which Bitcoin wallets they hold.\n\nHowever, most experts agree Satoshi Nakamoto is still the largest Bitcoin whale in the industry.\n\nSources:"

        "content": "Do you still doubt whether to buy cryptocurrencies or not? Do you like what Robert Kiyosaki writes? If your answer to both questions is positive, then you should hurry to buy a cryptocurrency, say, Bitcoin. The Bitcoin rate should be much higher than what it is now.\n\nBitcoin Rate Will Grow A Lot\n\nKiyosaki thinks that \u201cfaith in US dollar, fake money, will be destroyed.\u201d He also called gold and silver \u201cthe money of the gods\u201d and the first cryptocurrency \u201ca dollar for the people.\u201d\n\nAs a reminder, in November 2022, when Bitcoin\u2019s rate was low, Kiyosaki reaffirmed his commitment to it. In other words, this author believes that Bitcoin will become one of the main currencies in the future.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin analyst Willy Wu predicts that the number of owners of the flagship cryptocurrency will increase over the next three years. He says that by 2026, more than one billion people will own Bitcoins. As a reference, now, there are more than 300 million people who own the digital gold around the world.\n\nAlso Read: To Compensate For Bitcoin Mining Damage, We Need To Plant 431.6 Million New Trees\n\nWilly Wu reminded his followers on Twitter that it took Bitcoin six months to build an audience from its first 1,000 users. It took another five years for this number to grow to 1 million. It took 13 years and 8 months after the formation of the genesis block to reach the current indicators.\n\nGizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram\n\nWhen comparing with other tech bigwigs, the audience of PayPal is 430 million people, and Twitter\u2019s is 400 million. The crypto expert also believes that the lion\u2019s share of social network users are bots.\n\nThe CEO of the blockchain tech firm Blockstream, Adam Back, said that since 2013, the Bitcoin rate has doubled. So if this trend continues, in about nine years, the price of Bitcoin will reach $10 million by 2032. If so, its market capitalization will reach $200 trillion.\n\nBy the way, ChatGPT has predicted the Bitcoin rate to reach $50,000 in the next six months.\n\nBitcoin shows a minimal 2% increase compared to a day before.

Discover SCENE\n\nXverse, billed as a \u201cBitcoin wallet for Web3,\u201d just rolled out support for Ordinals, the newly popularized protocol allowing users to inscribe NFTs onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019ve launched first class support for Ordinals,\u201d tweeted the wallet team on Wednesday. The company explained that inscribing NFTs through its software involves \u201cno need to run a node, complex software, or anything else,\u201d merely some Bitcoin to pay a transaction fee, which can be bought directly through the app.\n\nInscriptions are made via Gamma.io, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace that rolled out \u201cno-code ordinal inscriptions\u201d last week. According to Xverse, roughly 5% of Bitcoin inscriptions so far have been made using Gamma\u2019s tool.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter uploading an image and sending a transaction to their provided Ordinals address, users can find their inscriptions inside their Xverse NFT collection within 20 to 30 minutes\u2014and embedded in the blockchain forever.\n\nThis comes just a day after Hiro, another Bitcoin focused Web3 wallet, rolled out inscriptions to its testnet on Tuesday. Both wallets interact with Stacks, a \u201clayer 1.5\u201d blockchain with its own NFT economy that settles its transactions on Bitcoin.\n\nXverse, too, lets Bitcoin users interact with Stacks, with plans to introduce instant payments via the lightning network.\n\nBitcoin recently logged its 100,000th Ordinals transaction, continuing a trend of exponential growth. Given that NFTs on Bitcoin were not a feature envisioned by its original developers, their existence has naturally sparked controversy, with many people unsure of whether they will hurt or help the network.\n\nStacks co-creator Muneeb Ali said he welcomes the new protocol, stating that it marks a \u201cnew chapter in Bitcoin history\u201d on Tuesday.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe sudden and explosive rise of Bitcoin NFTs via the new Ordinals project has sparked plenty of creativity from Web3 builders. Chainspace is one of the most vibrant examples to date\u2014an experimental art project that connects Bitcoin and Ethereum through a lo-fi video rendering app that\u2019s tied to both chains.\n\nThe project spans 800 total on-chain apps, each a unique portal that pseudonymous co-creators Timshel and el-ranye describe as a \u201cdigital object that emits infinite art.\u201d Put simply, each web app\u2014which lives entirely in an Ordinals inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014is like a Snapchat filter that manipulates the image coming from your computer or device camera.\n\nEssentially, it takes your detailed selfie cam footage and renders it like old-school ASCII art, using letters and symbols to depict your real-time video view in a more abstract, stylized manner. Each Chainspace portal gives a different effect, and some are inspired by the look and vibe of notable Web3 projects like Loot and Terraforms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\na @el__ranye x @TimshelXYZ experimental art project \u2514\u2af8 https://t.co/tpkbsRaFdf \ud835\ude8a \ud835\ude99\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9b\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude95 \ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude98 \ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude97\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude99\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8c\ud835\ude8e inscribed onchain on BTC on a single satoshi will be minting via @ourzora mega thanks to @isiain who worked w/ me on a cross-chain BTC<>ETH renderer https://t.co/B7bvLw0fFD pic.twitter.com/DAjMKdRai0 \u2014 Timshel {\ud835\ude9d\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude98\ud835\ude9e \ud835\ude96\ud835\ude8a\ud835\udea2\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude9c\ud835\ude9d} (@TimshelXYZ) February 9, 2023\n\nTimshel, who\u2019s a key figure in the emerging \u201cLootverse\u201d gaming community and involved in on-chain publishing efforts, told Decrypt that Chainspace provides a way for Web3 users to share a bit of their humanity with communities without fully doxxing themselves. Timshel showcased Chainspace-derived screenshots that users shared in the project\u2019s Discord.\n\n\u201cThis is beautiful because this \u2018GM\u2019 is much more essential and resonant and human than [a] random Pepe emoji,\u201d Timshel told Decrypt. \u201cThere's something really cool and special to see how people are using this, sharing their feelings, their selves, and their faces.\u201d\n\nThe NFT or inscription is not an \u201caccess pass\u201d to an experience hosted elsewhere. Because Ordinals can hold a lot more on-chain data than an Ethereum NFT, the complete web app is inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain as a digital artifact. Each Chainspace portal exists as its own unique Ordinals inscription that can be transferred between owners.\n\n\u201cThe Ordinals innovation, and the idea of inscribing up to now 4MB of content onto a single Satoshi on Bitcoin\u2014it just immediately clicked to me,\u201d Timshel told Decrypt. \u201cIt opened up a whole blossom of ideas in my head about things you can do that are higher fidelity than what's possible on ETH, but still create a token on ETH that's tradable and ownable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAcross chains\n\nHis comment hints at the Ethereum component of the Chainspace equation, but there are layers to it. Thursday\u2019s NFT mint will actually take place on Ethereum, with each portal represented by an Ethereum NFT that can be minted through Zora and traded through major marketplaces.\n\nThe Ethereum NFT is connected to the Bitcoin-based Ordinal on-chain through a smart contract\u2014which holds the code that powers decentralized apps (dapps) and NFT projects\u2014developed by Zora software engineer Iain Nash. The Ethereum NFT artwork you see on a marketplace like OpenSea is actually a screenshot generated from the Ordinal inscription.\n\nBut they\u2019re also paired in the sense that the NFT buyers can choose to trade in the Ethereum version and take custody of the Bitcoin Ordinal instead. Right now, that requires a manual process that Timshel and el-ranye can handle, but they aim to make it an easier, automated process as more and more Ordinals infrastructure comes online.\n\nAs such, Timshel describes Chainspace as being \u201c200% on-chains\u201d\u2014yes, plural\u2014since there\u2019s a part of the experience on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they\u2019re intertwined.\n\nBut the swap of the Ethereum NFT for custody of the Bitcoin Ordinal is a one-way process; they won\u2019t let users swap back and forth or hold both versions at the same time. He also cautioned that the ability to swap is dependent in part on the status of Ordinals, a fast-evolving space that has proven contentious to some Bitcoin aficionados. It\u2019s all an experiment for now.\n\nChainspace portals are publicly accessible, again reinforcing the idea that NFT owners are not buying an exclusive access pass. Anyone can use one of the portals and capture a still image from the manipulated video feed, and then they can do whatever they want with those\u2014share them through social media, mint them on-chain, generate derivative art, etc.\n\nThey\u2019ll put 620 of the NFTs on sale on Thursday, with an allowlist of active Discord users\u2014people who have already shared their Chainspace screenshots and creations\u2014able to mint one of the Ethereum NFTs for 0.33 ETH (about $550). Another 100 NFTs will be airdropped to Web3 builders who helped or influenced the project, with 60 NFTs reserved for the team.\n\nAnother 20 Chainspace apps, called X-portals, will have no Ethereum NFT counterpart and will live exclusively on Bitcoin. Those will be reserved for future auctions, as well as for the community around Ethereum NFT art project, Terraforms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2018Smashed penny\u2019\n\nGiven that they\u2019re publicly accessible, why would someone want to buy and own a Chainspace portal that isn\u2019t exclusively available to them? It doesn\u2019t come with any future promised utility or benefits, for example. A handful of the portals are available to play with via the project\u2019s website, while others can be accessed via each Ordinal\u2019s own page.\n\nTimshel cited the growing buzz around Ordinals and early on-chain inscriptions, and bets that people excited about on-chain media and Web3 experiments will want to own a portal. He likened it to public art installations that are open to all but ultimately still owned by someone, and compared an inscribed Satoshi to a souvenir flattened penny from an amusement park.\n\nI'm having so much fun generating these Chainspace templates aka high-functionality digital objects that bridge you into a higher plane. Experimental/performance art by @TimshelXYZ and @richa891 - in Chainspace, you are the art!\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/9c7AOtje3c \u2014 ozorian89 (@richa891) February 11, 2023\n\n\u201cI think people are really excited about owning the actual Satoshi itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want the \u2018smashed penny\u2019 with art on it in their wallet.\u201d\n\nAlready, they\u2019re seeing people turn Chainspace still images into derivative projects, such as Ethereum NFTs of screenshots of hand gestures or AI-assisted generative interpretations. People are free to do what they want with the portals, even if they don\u2019t own them.\n\nBut ultimately, the goal is to explore new frontiers in experimental on-chain art tools while giving each user a totally unique experience. It loops back to the phrase that the co-creators have been using since the project was unveiled last week: \u201cYou are the art.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery portal is public and inscribed on Bitcoin for anybody to render, forever. But every viewing is a private one-of-one,\u201d Timshel explained. \u201cI don't think there ever will be another time where somebody's pixels and Chainspace look exactly like what's on my screen right now. It\u2019d be like finding a grain of sand in the universe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "The partnership news between El Salvador and Texas comes just five days after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published their annual report on El Salvador\u2019s progress.\n\nSurprisingly, the IMF admitted that adopting Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender has accelerated El Salvador\u2019s economic growth, also pointing out that \u201cunprecedented reduction in crime, and strong remittances and tourism revenues have contributed to the robust activity and investment dynamics.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the yearly report by the IMF also emphasized that not a lot of local people in the small Latin American country use Bitcoin (BTC), while some have barely heard of it.\n\nThe IMF contemplates that Bitcoin\u2019s use \u201ccould grow given its legal tender status and new legislative reforms to encourage the use of crypto assets, including tokenized bonds (Digital Assets Law).\u201d In addition, the report concludes that \u201cefforts are underway to develop citizens\u2019 digital skills by partnering with fintech firms.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Digital Assets Law has mostly to do with the Volcano bonds \u2013 tokenized sovereign bonds, which would enable foreign investors to invest in the Bitcoin Nation. El Salvador\u2019s government expects to raise over $1 billion with the Volcano bonds, which will invest in Bitcoin City\u2019s infrastructure and promote education about the world\u2019s leading decentralized cryptocurrency."

        "content": "U.S. stocks sold off on Thursday as investors parsed through more hotter-than-expected economic data and hawkish Fedspeak.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by 1.3%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) plunged by 1.8%.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) rallied, hitting a new six-month high as regulatory crackdowns drove continued uneasiness in the crypto space. The token briefly topped $25,000 for the first time since August.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 3.867% Thursday midday. The dollar index inched higher by nearly 0.09% to trade at $104.02. Energy traded lower, with WTI crude oil prices down at $78.03 a barrel.\n\nInvestors digested fresh economic data on Thursday, the headline of which was January\u2019s producer price index (PPI). Headline PPI came in at a monthly increase of 0.7%, hotter than the 0.4% expected by economists.\n\nAlso on the macroeconomic front, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims slid to 194,000 for the week ended Feb. 11, the Labor Department said on Thursday, lower than the 200,000 expected by economists.\n\nTwo Federal Reserve officials also made headlines Thursday with comments suggesting the central bank could be in for a long battle with inflation.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said she was open to raising interest rates by 0.50%, more than what her peers voted for during the last monetary policy meeting. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said he favors additional rate hikes amid sticky inflation at the Fed's March meeting. Bullard said he favored bringing up the federal funds rate to 5.375% as soon as possible, up from a current level of 4.50%-4.75%.\n\nStocks had capped off the previous session higher after economic data continued to suggest the economy remains resilient in the face of higher rates and sticky inflation.\n\nRetail sales surged 3% in January, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday, reversing two consecutive monthly declines. Coupled with higher-than-expected reading on consumer prices Tuesday, concerns the Fed could keep raising interest rates have weighed on stocks this week.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cRobust job growth and a level-shift up in disposable income in the new year also contributed to the Jan spending spike,\u201d Bank of America Economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note following the release.\n\nEconomists at JPMorgan raised their Q1 GDP projection to 2% from 1% on the news, noting that the acceleration in retail sales adds to \u201cthe goldilocks view of growth without inflation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office warned on Wednesday that the Treasury Department\u2019s ability to continue paying its government bills would be exhausted by the summer unless lawmakers strike a deal to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nBuilders continued to slow down home construction in January as housing starts fell to an annualized rate of 1.309 million homes, the Commerce Department said, down from the 1.356 million estimated. And permits to build slipped 0.1% to an annualized rate of 1.34 million, below consensus expectations of 1.35 million.\n\n\"The future for home construction became a bit bleaker this month as data on inflation, jobs and retail sales foreshadow the Federal Reserve may hike its federal fund rate higher than was expected a month ago,\" Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a statement following the release.\n\nSeparately, Redfin (RDFN), DoorDash (DASH), and Dropbox (DBX) are gearing up to report quarterly results on Thursday after the bell.\n\nIn single stock moves, shares of Paramount (PARA) dropped 4.2% Thursday after the media giant reported an earnings miss on the top and bottom line. Revenue came in at $8.13 billion compared to $8.17 billion expected and subscriber growth also took a hit, reaching 9.9 million for the quarter versus the 10 million forecasted by analysts.\n\nShopify (SHOP) shares sank nearly 16% Thursday after the e-commerce company posted results for the fourth quarter, with revenue coming in at $1.73 billion against estimates for $1.65 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.07 topped estimates for $0.02. The Ottawa-based company expects first-quarter revenue slightly below forecasts.\n\nRoku (ROKU) stock rose Thursday after the company\u2019s net revenue of $867.1 million topped expectations for $804.5 million. Fourth-quarter loss per share of $1.70 came in slightly below the $1.74 expected by analysts.\n\nShares of Cisco (CSCO) climbed more than 5% after the company raised its third-quarter revenue guidance to be between 11% to 13% higher year-over-year, topping analysts' expectations.\n\nTesla (TSLA) shares were down after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced Tesla would recall 362,758 vehicles, citing safety issues with its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software.\n\n\u2014\n\nDani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "A closely followed crypto analyst believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could now be in a position to significantly outperform Ethereum (ETH).\n\nPseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 562,700 Twitter followers that the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair (ETH/BTC) is now trading below a diagonal trendline, suggesting that ETH is likely to trail BTC in terms of gains.\n\n\u201cETH/BTC finally broke beneath the high timeframe support line we\u2019ve been watching.\n\nRemember, this chart only shows relative strength to BTC, so expect to see BTC begin to outpace a bit more rapidly sometime over the next several weeks.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, a bearish ETH/BTC chart indicates that Bitcoin will likely rise in value faster than Ethereum and the general altcoin market.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin itself, Kaleo says BTC is likely headed toward the $30,000 price level after it managed to bounce from support at around $21,000.\n\n\u201cHigh timeframe support has held strong. SPX [S&P 500 index] is currently at 4,000 support, which I still see rallying to 4,300 over the coming weeks. $30,000 is a magnet.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, Kaleo says Bitcoin will likely gather more momentum if it takes out resistance at $22,400.\n\n\u201cCPI came in a bit higher than expected and the market is basically flat. SPX / NDX [Nasdaq-100 Index] look primed for a leg higher after a bit of initial volatility, and BTC is knocking on the door of reclaiming a major level it lost last Thursday. $30,000+ is still a magnet.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $22,214.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "The 10 Biggest Crypto Whales in the Market - Bankless Times",
        "content": "Who are the biggest crypto whales in the market today, and what kind of impact do they have on the investment landscape? In the cryptocurrency space, \u201cwhale\u201d is the term given to an investor who holds a huge amount of coins or tokens of a particular cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto whales are important to the cryptocurrency investment space because they can create a ripple effect in the market, generating changes in token valuation.\n\nIf you know where the whales are swimming, you can often gain a better idea of how the markets they\u2019re involved in might be influenced going forward.\n\nWho Are the Biggest Cryptocurrency Whales Right Now?\n\nDefining the biggest whales in crypto can be difficult. While some of the biggest investors in cryptocurrency are very open about how many tokens they hold, others are less straightforward. Cryptocurrency can be a highly anonymized area, so it\u2019s difficult to know for certain which big wallets belong to which people.\n\nSome of the biggest cryptocurrency whales are actually major companies responsible for trading or managing large amounts of tokens.\n\nHowever, this list focuses on individuals known to us by name (or pseudonym), and these are some of the biggest crypto whales we\u2019re aware of right now based on estimates by experts.\n\n1. Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nUndoubtedly the biggest cryptocurrency whale in the world, Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym for the inventor of Bitcoin. We\u2019re not sure for certain whether this is a person or a group of people, but we do know they continue to hold ownership of around 1 million BTC.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, 1 million BTC equates to around 19.2 billion US dollars. If Nakamoto is a single person, this would make them the biggest crypto whale of all time.\n\n2. Brian Armstrong\n\nBrian Armstrong is the CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges on the market. The website handles billions of trades every day, and Brian has a significant amount of crypto contributing to his own net worth.\n\nEstimates suggest the CEO has a crypto fortune worth of around $6.5 billion. However, it\u2019s difficult to know what kind of crypto whale Armstrong is and which currencies he holds.\n\n3. Michael Saylor\n\nMichael Saylor is an American entrepreneur and businessman, as well as one of the biggest Bitcoin whales of all time. Experts even believe he might have been responsible for some major movements in the Bitcoin landscape, and he currently owns more than 17,732 bitcoins, worth over $1.14 billion.\n\nSaylor\u2019s company, MicroStrategy, also began accumulating bitcoins in 2020. While we don\u2019t know exactly how many Bitcoins Michael holds today, some experts say the BTC bank for the company is worth billions.\n\n4. Chris Larsen\n\nOne of the co-founders of the credit lending company Eloan, and peer-to-peer lending site Prosper, Chris Larsen helped to launch the Ripple cryptocurrency in 2012. Ripple is a blockchain network that has grown popular in the crypto whales list over the years.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no direct information on how much crypto Larsen holds overall, Larsen does have at least 5.19 billion XRP, creating a net holding worth of around $37.3 billion.\n\n5. Changpeng Zhao\n\nThe CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, is considered to be one of the biggest Bitcoin whales on the market, though he hasn\u2019t released a lot of information about his holdings. Unsurprisingly, Zhao\u2019s crypto holdings fall into both Binance coin and Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to reports, Zhao\u2019s net worth is around $96 billion, but this doesn\u2019t take into account his cryptocurrency holdings, which he says he plans on donating to charity.\n\n6. Vitalik Buterin\n\nVitalik Buterin is considered to be one of the biggest Ethereum whales on the market, though his holdings in ETH remain unknown at this time. As the co-creator of Ethereum, Buterin was once said to hold around 355,000 Ethereum, as well as various whale-sized quantities of other coins, like SHIB, Akita, and Dogecoin.\n\nIn 2022, Vitalik announced he was no longer a crypto whale following the collapse of various coin investments. However, we don\u2019t know for certain how much he holds today.\n\n7. Tim Draper\n\nWell-known venture capitalist, tech billionaire, and entrepreneur Tim Draper is considered to be one of the biggest players on the Bitcoin whales list after he purchased 30,000 bitcoins for a bargain price when they were seized by Silk Road.\n\nThough Draper won\u2019t reveal how many bitcoins he currently owns today, he also has wallets in various other cryptocurrencies, such as Aragon\u2019s \u201cANT\u201d tokens. The tech expert is expected to be worth a little over $1 billion.\n\n8. The Winklevoss Twins\n\nThe Winklevoss twins are perhaps best known for accusing Mark Zuckerberg for stealing their idea for a social network. In a 2012 settlement, they won around $65 million in court and invested it in a stack of Bitcoin. At the time, the twins were said to purchase about 1% of all the BTC in existence.\n\nThe twins are still considered to be some of the biggest Bitcoin whales around, with around 70,000 bitcoins in their portfolio, as well as a variety of other cryptocurrencies.\n\n9. Barry Silbert\n\nBarry Silbert acquired Digital Currency Group with funds from the sale of Second-Market, an equity trading platform acquired by Nasdaq in 2015.\n\nThis conglomerate consists of five companies, one of which is Grayscale, a digital asset management company.\n\nGrayscale manages a portfolio of assets worth over $28 billion (\u00a320.6 billion), including Bitcoin and Ether. It was the first application approved to trade securities backed by Bitcoin and raised about \u00a3434 million annually.\n\n10. Jed McCaleb\n\nJed McCaleb was one of the co-founders of Ripple and is, therefore, one of the biggest XRP whales in the market today. Although McCaleb left the company following a disagreement with his other founders, he\u2019s still said to own around 3.4 billion XRP.\n\nBy today\u2019s standards, this gives McCaleb\u2019s wallet a net worth of around $1.6 billion, which makes up a significant portion of his overall wealth. Apparently, Jed also has investments in other crypto markets, though he hasn\u2019t revealed the details of his portfolio.\n\nThe Biggest Crypto Whales Today\n\nCrypto whales\u2019 fortunes can be difficult to estimate because not everyone is open about their cryptocurrency holdings. The information we have about the current crypto whales is based on the news reports issued by major crypto purchases over the years. However, the volatility of the crypto market means many new whales could emerge in the future.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho are the biggest crypto whales? The biggest crypto whales are people with the largest numbers of tokens in a specific cryptocurrency. For instance, one of the top crypto whales in Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto, the individual responsible for initially creating BTC. How many crypto whales are there? While we do have some information about the largest crypto whales to hit the market throughout the years, many of these people and entities remain anonymous. As such, it\u2019s difficult to determine how many crypto whales there really are. How much money do you need to be a crypto whale? Being a crypto whale isn\u2019t about the amount of money you have as much as it is about the number of tokens or coins you own in a specific currency. Crypto whales usually have around at least $10 million worth of a specific coin.\n\nHere Are More Crypto Guides"
