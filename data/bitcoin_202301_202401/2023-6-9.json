        "content": "Bitcoin is an ineffective cult that not even \u201cbad guys\u201d want to join anymore, said the author of The Black Swan, a bestselling book on the extreme impact of outlier events. Cryptocurrency falls short on its claim to streamline payments, and doesn\u2019t even facilitate illegal transactions well, Nassim Taleb told Bloomberg on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even good for money laundering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is too traceable. Gold you can re-melt [into] bars, you can do something, but Bitcoin has a book entry somewhere that anyone with basic knowledge of statistics can triangularize.\u201d\n\nThe essayist assailed broader crypto culture, too, describing it as fanatical and dysfunctional.\n\n\u201cIt has transformed into a cult. The first time in history probably, we\u2019re mixing money and cults,\u201d Taleb told Bloomberg. \u201cUsually you do cults with yoga\u2026cults with music, but here is a cult with a financial product. These things don\u2019t go together well, because finance has some gravity rules that eventually end up hurting that model.\u201d\n\nHe added that crypto is a fad that falsely claims to be a refuge from regulation. Despite advertising itself as a haven from government oversight, Bitcoin is \u201cnot even attracting the bad guys anymore,\u201d according to Taleb.\n\nTaleb, a former options trader and risk analyst, has switched his stance on crypto over recent years. In 2019, he was an advocate for the currency\u2019s antiestablishment ethos. He disapproved of the Lebanese government\u2019s capital controls on banks, and lauded Bitcoin for existing outside central banking.\n\n\u201cThe most potent case for cryptocurrencies: Banks are never there when you need them,\u201d Taleb tweeted in 2019. \u201cAnd they are trying to bully the public so they avoid accountability and profit disbursements. Bankers are legal crooks.\u201d\n\nBitcoin currently trades at around $26,400, down about 12% from this time last year, and down 62% from its peak of over $68,000 in November 2021.\n\nTaleb previously invested in Bitcoin, but in 2021 he began selling his crypto because he found the currency too volatile. He also tweeted that the Bitcoin community had been taken over by \u201cCOVID-denying sociopaths with the sophistication of amoebas.\u201d\n\nEver since, the author has been vocal about his distaste for crypto and predicted its failure. On Tuesday, he compared Bitcoin to the Mafia, but said the Mafia was truer to its promise of protection than cryptocurrency.\n\nTaleb also told Bloomberg that the Federal Reserve could pull the plug on crypto at any moment, and would replace Bitcoin next month. He said this in reference to FedNow, an instant payment service the Fed plans to introduce in July. FedNow will let individuals and businesses transfer money in real time and have access to the funds within seconds, according to a video by the Fed. The service, which does not necessarily replace crypto, will be released in phases starting next month.\n\nTaleb\u2019s comments on Bloomberg came on the same day that the founders of Binance and Coinbase, the two largest crypto trading platforms, lost close to a combined $2 billion after being hit with SEC lawsuits. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong lost $361 million, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao lost $1.4 billion.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is suing Binance for alleged \u201cwash trading,\u201d when a company trades with itself to inflate volume. Meanwhile, he\u2019s suing Coinbase for allegedly selling unregistered tokens and acting as a broker, exchange, and clearinghouse without permission.\n\nTaleb took aim at Coinbase on Thursday, replying to a tweet by the trading platform claiming it is easier to deliver a bag of money by plane than by wire transfer, and that crypto is a faster solution. Taleb responded by writing that the statement was a lie \u201cmeant to fool those who don\u2019t do wire transfers.\u201d"

        "title": "Ohio needs to champion bitcoin and blockchain technologies| columnist - The Columbus Dispatch",
        "content": "Andrew Burchwell\n\nGuest Columnist\n\nOhio\u2019s historical legacy is rooted in innovation. Our economic success and progress have always depended on our willingness to try new things \u2013 leading to innovations in energy manufacturing, healthcare, IT and more. Today, as we see new opportunities through digital advancements in blockchain technologies like bitcoin, it\u2019s critical we keep our innovative spirit alive and open to stay competitive in an increasingly complex and global environment.\n\nOhioans might be surprised to learn that our state is home to many industry leaders in bitcoin and blockchain development. One reason for the unfamiliarity is that industry leaders benefit from a unified voice to advocate for the industry\u2019s potential, and Ohio is just beginning to organize and champion bitcoin and blockchain technologies from a statewide perspective.\u200b\n\nIf we do not act with an intention, Ohio will miss out on a generational opportunity for its communities, businesses, and families. We are still very early in the development of these technologies, and it is an opportunity Ohio is uniquely positioned to capture.\n\nAt Ohio Blockchain Council, we are working to unite industries under a common banner to advance bitcoin and blockchain technologies for and within our great state. We believe Ohio is well positioned to be a global leader in innovation and development. Combining the resources of multiple companies from various business sectors is our most effective pathway to progress.\n\nOne of the barriers to adoption of any technology is public understanding. The technology behind Bitcoin and blockchain is unquestionably complicated. What is not complicated, though still underemphasized in our public conversation, is the direct positive impact these technologies could have on all of Ohio\u2019s communities. Families across Ohio struggle with high healthcare costs. Recently the Cleveland Clinic, IBM, Aetna and Anthem announced a partnership that will utilize blockchain to improve efficiency, reduce costs and enhance customer experience.\n\nOhio\u2019s rural population stands to uniquely benefit from bitcoin adoption. While bitcoin mining operations like the Standard Power facility in Coshocton create jobs and increase local economic activity, the long-term implications of bitcoin adoption are far greater. It looks like farmers utilizing bitcoin to exert greater control over their pricing, markets and quality assurance. It means small businesses using bitcoin to avoid fees and open themselves up to new customer bases. It allows a new source of funding for municipalities struggling to compete and provide new accommodations for residents. These are just a few examples of the many ways in which the lives of Ohioans will be transformed for the better through innovation.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology also carry the potential to help solve one of our most complicated and pervasive challenges today: public trust. According to a recent Pew Research report, only two out of 10 Americans trust the federal government. University of Chicago Institute of Politics research indicates that a majority of Americans agree with the statement \u201cthe government is corrupt and rigged against everyday people like me.\u201d Here in Ohio, where we\u2019re living through a still unfolding massive public corruption scandal, it\u2019s very likely trust in public institutions is at an all-time low.\n\nBlockchain technology can help rebuild public trust by enhancing accountability in government contracting, electronic voting, grant disbursement and more, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. That\u2019s because blockchain technology is by definition decentralized, objective and transparent.\n\nMore:Logistics, bitcoin companies receive state tax incentives to create 125 jobs in Columbus\n\nOhio\u2019s congressional delegation has been championing these issues because they know how important they are to our state\u2019s growth. It\u2019s not a red vs. blue issue, and has been overwhelmingly bipartisan through the leadership of Rep. Warren Davidson (R) and Rep. Joyce Beatty (D) in the House of Representatives and newly elected Sen. J.D. Vance (R) in the Senate.\n\nHowever, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) has been absent as a champion and leader on bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. He sits as chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction on these important issues, but has yet to be a forward-leaning advocate for our state. Senator Brown has the opportunity to propel Ohio into a category of its own on bitcoin, and we are here to show him that the work being done across our beautiful state is only just beginning.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technologies represent significant potential for uplifting communities, businesses, and families. Harnessing this potential is only possible through an aligned, unified and collaborative approach toward adoption and public policy. This is our mission at Ohio Blockchain Council, and we believe Ohio can truly become the heart of it all.\n\nAndrew Burchwell, executive director of Ohio Blockchain Council"

        "title": "JPMorgan Expects Retail Demand for Bitcoin to Remain Strong as Reward Halving Approaches - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nIn anticipation of the next halving event for Bitcoin, researchers from JPMorgan have declared their belief that the underlying asset will remain strong.\n\nAn integral component of Bitcoin\u2019s long-term viability is the cap on the volume of coins that can be mined. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and there is a gradual taper from the early days of extremely easy mining to a tiny crawl by the very end of bitcoin mining\u2019s lifespan. The mechanism for this gradual taper takes the form of the \u201chalving\u201d event, when certain passed milestones in bitcoin mined will automatically cut all mining rewards in half. In other words, the same amount of equipment and electricity will create half as many assets as it had a day before. The next halving is about a year away.\n\nThis event has happened three times in Bitcoin\u2019s past, and according to research published in June by JPMorgan, the last two halvings led to a rally in bitcoin\u2019s price. The 2024 halving seems well on track to continue this trend, as the report claims that a halving \u201cwould mechanically double bitcoin production cost to around $40,000, creating a positive psychological effect.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the increase in production cost would help raise the floor for bitcoin\u2019s valuation, and lead to an increase in demand for coins in circulation. Institutional investment has diminished somewhat, the report claims, but Ordinals and the BRC-20 protocol have been attracting lots of attention from retail investors. This endorsement of future performance is particularly interesting from JPMorgan, as the firm has historically displayed a skeptical attitude for Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the main effects the halving will have on the Bitcoin community is its radical impact on miners. With such a sheer drop in productivity, mining firms will surely struggle to maintain market viability for the sheer output of equipment and electricity. Instead, only the firms that are the most well configured to run efficiently will be able to weather the storm. When less efficient miners are pushed out of the pool, this will leave these miners able to take home a bigger proportion of the pie. In the end, the halving will be a mechanism that forces the whole industry\u2019s hardware to optimize.\n\nIndeed, to an untrained observer, it might be quite surprising that the community is full of predictions that the halving will only spell good things for Bitcoin. How could increased costs of production be good for business? The simple answer is that, because Bitcoin has already been halved many times before and \u201ctrimming the fat\u201d of mining operations has historically led to more buzz from investment, Bitcoiners are assuming the same will take place again. The difficulty in acquiring fresh bitcoin will lead to increased interest in purchasing old ones, and the mining industry will be disrupted in a way that ultimately benefits it.\n\nThe halving is expected to take place in about a year, according to current industry estimates, and there is still plenty of time to observe the trends in the market and adjust these predictions accordingly. With years of experience behind it, however, the Bitcoin community is resolute.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "This article compares the cryptocurrencies ETH and BTC, looking at their differences, pros and cons, and if they constitute good investments.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Vs. Bitcoin (BTC)\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are the two most widely-used cryptocurrencies globally. They\u2019re programmed differently, e.g., Ethereum uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while Bitcoin uses proof-of-work. This article will help you understand the differences between them.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Chart\n\nETH BTC Creator Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood Satoshi Nakamoto Launch date July 30, 2015 January 3, 2009 Market capitalization $148 billion $317 billion Supply 122 million tokens 19 million tokens Hash Rate None (doesn\u2019t rely on mining) 255MH/s Fees Varying gas fees Varying gas fees Privacy Pseudonymous Pseudonymous Consensus mechanism Proof-of-stake Proof-of-work Block time 10 to 19 seconds 10 minutes Future token issuance Maximum of 18 million new tokens every year Maximum supply of 21 million tokens All-time high $4,811.39 $67,598.09\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating on a blockchain. The blockchain is a public ledger that records all transactions on the Bitcoin network. Anyone with a Bitcoin wallet address can send tokens to another address or receive tokens from another address. Bitcoin was conceptualized and created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a person whose real identity remains unknown. The first block for Bitcoin was created in January 2009, and the first reported real-world financial transaction using Bitcoin took place in May 2010 when a Florida man paid 10,000 BTC for two boxes of pizzas. As of its first reported transaction, one Bitcoin was worth roughly a fourth of a cent. A few years after, millions of people began adopting the token, and demand shot up, driving the price of a single Bitcoin to an all-time high of over $67,000 in 2021. However, the 2022 crypto market crash has seen the price of Bitcoin slump to just over $16,000.\n\nPros And Cons Of Investing In Ethereum\n\nPros Supports global transactions with fast speeds\n\nSupports global transactions with fast speeds Zero network downtime over the past few years\n\nZero network downtime over the past few years Decentralized digital currency Cons Highly volatile\n\nHighly volatile Transaction fees can be high depending on network demand\n\nTransaction fees can be high depending on network demand No maximum supply, so there\u2019s a high risk of inflation\n\nETH Vs. BTC: Similarities And Differences\n\nSimilarities Both tokens have high demand and a very liquid market.\n\nBoth are decentralized tokens operating on a public ledger (blockchain).\n\nBoth tokens have millions of users globally.\n\nBoth use alphanumeric strings as wallet addresses and are tradable on crypto exchanges. Differences ETH uses the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, while BTC uses proof-of-work.\n\nBTC has a maximum supply, while ETH doesn\u2019t.\n\nBTC relies on mining, while ETH doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain processes transactions significantly faster than the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Price\n\nBTC has historically had a much higher market capitalization than Ethereum. Both cryptocurrencies peaked in 2021, a bubbly year for digital assets, but in 2022 have plunged from their all-time highs.\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum Fees\n\nEvery Bitcoin transaction includes a gas fee paid to the miners on the network validating the transaction. Likewise, every Ethereum transaction includes gas fees paid to the network\u2019s validators. These fees are separate from what exchanges and brokerages charge to facilitate transactions.\n\nETH BTC Gas Fee: The minimum number of tokens necessary to execute a transaction, and it varies based on network demand. You can offer additional tips so that validators will prioritize your transaction. Gas Fee: The amount paid to the blockchain to execute a transaction. It varies based on network demand.\n\nBitcoin Vs. Ethereum Privacy\n\nUsing a decentralized exchange, you can purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum without giving up your identity. In contrast, centralized exchanges have know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, so users must provide some form of identity. Yet, even when you use a decentralized exchange, both Ethereum and Bitcoin aren\u2019t fully anonymous, as someone may be able to tie your wallet address to your real-world identity via a platform you transact with.\n\nWhat Is Proof Of Work (POW) Vs. Proof-Of-Stake (POS)? Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are the most popular mechanisms for validating transactions on a blockchain, but they work differently. Proof of Work Proof of Stake Relies on miners whose capacity depends on computational power Relies on stakers whose validating capacity depends on the amount of tokens they stake Miners receive block rewards Stakers receive transaction fees as rewards Requires expensive mining equipment and high energy usage Doesn\u2019t require expensive equipment or high energy usage The proof-of-work mechanism uses a competitive validation method (solving complex mathematical puzzles) to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain, while proof of stake uses validators selected at random to confirm transactions and add new blocks. Bitcoin operates on the proof-of-work mechanism, while Ethereum operates on the proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nBTC Vs. ETH Use Cases\n\nYou can use BTC and ETH for different types of transactions or as a store of value.\n\nTop BTC Use Cases\n\nStore of value : You can use BTC as an alternative currency to store your assets.\n\n: You can use BTC as an alternative currency to store your assets.

Lending: You can lend your ETH to other users and earn interest via a lending protocol.\n\nETH Vs. BTC Long-Term: Which Is A Better Investment?\n\nETH and BTC can be good long-term investments that\u2019ll yield profits. Yet, be sure to perform your own due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency. This article isn\u2019t investment advice.\n\nA Case For Investing In ETH\n\nETH is one of the most traded cryptocurrencies globally. Anyone getting into the crypto markets as a newbie has likely heard of ETH, so may be compelled to buy it. The Ethereum network offers very fast transaction processing speeds compared to many other cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s volatile but not as volatile as most altcoins. The token\u2019s recent shift from the proof-of-work mechanism to proof of stake has attracted more users and increased its demand.\n\nAs of late 2022, the crypto market is experiencing a widespread rout that has the value of many tokens to plunge, including ETH. If you believe the market is headed for recovery, it\u2019ll be a smart decision to invest in ETH.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nThe token is vulnerable to massive price swings.\n\nTransaction fees can be very high when there\u2019s significant demand on the network.\n\nMany smart contract platforms are emerging to compete with Ethereum, so its appeal might fade.\n\nCrypto wallets and exchanges where you hold ETH are vulnerable to hacking attacks.\n\nA Case For Investing In BTC\n\nBTC is the cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization. The demand for BTC is enormous across the globe, so there\u2019s always the chance of it increasing in value.

        "title": "Russian nationals accused of Mt. Gox bitcoin heist, shifting stolen funds to BTC-e - The Record from Recorded Future News",
        "content": "The Justice Department is accusing two Russian nationals of being behind the headline-grabbing hack of Mt. Gox, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange from 2010 to 2013.\n\nOn Friday, the DOJ unsealed charges filed in 2019 against 43-year-old Alexey Bilyuchenko and 29-year-old Aleksandr Verner, accusing the two of stealing 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox and using it to underpin the illicit cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e from 2011 to 2017.\n\nBilyuchenko is also being charged for running BTC-e with Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national extradited to the U.S. last August after a 2017 arrest in Greece. Vinnik is accused of laundering more than $4 billion of criminal proceeds through BTC-e.\n\nBilyuchenko and Verner are facing conspiracy to commit money laundering charges while Bilyuchenko is facing accusations of money laundering, conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money services business.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite said Bilyuchenko helped set up BTC-e in part to launder the funds that were stolen from Mt. Gox \u2014 an assessment others investigating the case have made previously.\n\n\u201cFor years, Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators allegedly operated a digital currency exchange that enabled criminals around the world \u2014 including computer hackers, ransomware actors, narcotics rings, and corrupt public officials \u2014 to launder billions of dollars,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey.\n\nCourt documents unsealed in the Southern District of New York accuse Bilyuchenko, Verner and unnamed co-conspirators of hacking into the Japan-based computer servers holding the cryptocurrency wallets used by Mt. Gox customers.\n\nThe suspects transferred the funds from Mt. Gox\u2019s wallets to bitcoin addresses controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner and others, prosecutors said.\n\nThe Justice Department said the group siphoned the 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox between September 2011 and May 2014, effectively wiping out the platform\u2019s holdings of that currency. The platform shut down in 2014.\n\nIn April 2012, the group allegedly struck a deal with an unnamed bitcoin brokerage service to liquidate the stolen currency in exchange for large wire transfers to several offshore bank accounts.\n\nBetween March 2012 and April 2013, the brokerage transferred about $6.6 million to overseas bank accounts controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators.\n\nIn return, the brokerage got \u201ccredit\u201d on another crypto platform controlled by the group. Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly laundered more than 300,000 bitcoin stolen from Mt. Gox on this unnamed crypto exchange.\n\nFor years, former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles faced accusations that he was behind the theft and collapse of the platform.\n\nBTC-e laundering\n\nIn charges unsealed in the Northern District of California, Bilyuchenko is accused of working with Vinnik and others to run BTC-e until it was shut down by law enforcement in July 2017.\n\nBTC-e was a hotbed for criminal activity according to the Justice Department, serving as \u201cone of the primary ways by which cyber criminals around the world transferred, laundered, and stored the criminal proceeds of their illegal activities.\u201d\n\nThe platform allegedly served more than one million users worldwide \u2013 helping launder the proceeds of \u201cnumerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware events, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs alleged, Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner thought they could outsmart the law by using sophisticated hacks to steal and launder massive amounts of cryptocurrency, a novel technology at the time, but the charges unsealed demonstrate our ability to tenaciously pursue these alleged criminals, no matter how complex their schemes, until they are brought to justice,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York."

It's spurred a full-blown crackdown on the industry, with other major exchanges including Binance being pulled into the crosshairs of inspection."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether rise amid \u2018swoon-soar\u2019 trading after SEC lawsuits against Binance, Coinbase - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin prices rose in Friday morning trading in Asia, but failed to break back above US$27,000 after a rollercoaster week in crypto markets following the lawsuits by U.S. securities regulators against the Binance and Coinbase exchanges. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies gained, with Polygon\u2019s Matic token leading the winners.\n\nTop 10 gain ground\n\nBitcoin strengthened 1.06% over the last 24 hours to US$26,551 at 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, making up some losses from earlier this week after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against two of the world\u2019s biggest exchanges, alleging dozens of of crypto tokens have been illegally offered and traded as unregistered securities. The world\u2019s largest crypto by market capitalization is now down 1.26% for the past seven days after sharper declines earlier in the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nEther climbed 1.1% to US$1,849, and logged a 0.98% weekly decline.\n\nPolygon\u2019s MATIC was the biggest gainer among the top 10, with a 2.69% rise, but it has lost 12.02% in value for the past week.\n\nBinance\u2019s BNB added 2.01% in the past 24 hours, the second-largest rise among the top 10, but is a big loser for the week, down 13.9%.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap edged up 0.35% to US$1.1 trillion in the 24 hours through to 8:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, while daily trading volume dropped 35.3% to US$25.9 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nIn a new court filing on Wednesday, the SEC said transactions involving several billions of dollars of customer funds moved through now-defunct Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank under accounts allegedly controlled by Binance officials, including chief executive Changpeng Zhao.\n\nSachin Verma, an accountant employed by the SEC, said in the filing that some of the funds were moved to accounts suspected to belong to offshore firms linked to Zhao and Binance, in various regions including the Seychelles, Lithuania and Kazakhstan.\n\nZhao tweeted on Thursday that this is \u201csimply false\u201d in response to a CoinDesk article that said US$12 billion of funds was sent to Zhao, citing the Wednesday filing.\n\n\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, Binance.US had in total roughly US$2 billion in user funds. This number in USD equivalent fluctuates a little as crypto prices change. And declining as users withdraw due to recent news,\u201d Zhao tweeted. \u201cAll user funds are accounted for, and never left the Binance.US platform (unless users withdraw themselves of course), ever.\u201d\n\nGordon Grant, co-head of trading at crypto brokerage Genesis Trading, said that this week\u2019s sweeping regulatory pronouncements \u201csaw crypto realized volatility begin to rear its head.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter seeming months of coiling in an ornery, reptilian rip-rap price action, the successive Monday and Tuesday swoon-soar tandem on the back of Binance and Coinbase headlines preempted consternation, head scratching and, if nothing else, a recognition that the asset class remains habitually prone to lurid gaps in price action,\u201d Grant said.\n\nIn an email, Le Shi, head of trading at Auros, a crypto market-making and algorithmic trading firm, said cryptocurrency trading volumes continue to \u201cplumb the depths\u201d last seen in the middle of the last crypto bear market.\n\nCoinShares, a European crypto investment firm, said in a Thursday report shared with Forkast that while the SEC lawsuits seem to carry more severe implications for Binance, the potential impact on Coinbase and the broader crypto industry is significant.\n\n\u201cThe charges insinuate that a majority of crypto assets should be categorized as securities, which would radically modify the regulatory landscape, potentially confining access to regulated Wall Street entities (assuming that they have the appetite once the litigation is over),\u201d CoinShares wrote.\n\nCoinShares added that the shift could potentially place the control of the crypto industry within the grasp of traditional financial institutions.\n\nNFT sales drop\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 1.07% to 3,219.65 in the 24 hours to 9:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index was down 4.59% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum fell 14.4% over the last 24 hours to US$13.72 million, and sales on the Bitcoin network dropped 9.34% to US$3.53 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s a] hard market to analyze right now,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, said on Friday.\n\n\u201cOn one hand I believe we\u2019ll see capitulation to the negative news, especially once the SEC files lawsuits against (NFT) projects, but at the same time, we are seeing bullish news from projects, art, among others, on an almost daily basis,\u201d Petscher added. \u201cI don\u2019t think the SEC\u2019s lawsuits have played a factor yet. They should soon.\u201d\n\nUncategorized Ordinals \u2013 recently popular Bitcoin Ordinals that are not part of an established collection \u2013 saw the largest sales in the past 24 hours with a 74.13% rise to US$1.54 million.\n\nThe Captainz, an Ethereum-based collection, recorded a 2.33% increase in sales to US$1.12 million, making it the second most sold collection in the past day, followed by Mythos chain-based DMarket\u2019s US$1.11 million daily sales.\n\nIn another development, crypto exchange Kraken has launched its NFT marketplace out of beta with over 250 collections.\n\nLuca Netz, the chief executive officer of intellectual property firm and NFT collection Pudgy Penguins, is set to launch a Web 3.0 licensing marketplace named Overpass as early as late June, according to a Thursday report by media firm NFT Now.\n\nPudgy Penguins is an Ethereum-based NFT collection of 8,888 unique digital assets. It is the 19th largest collection in all-time sales, with more than US$257 million traded, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nU.S. stock futures fall\n\nNew York Stock Exchange. Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 10:10 a.m. in Hong Kong after the major U.S. stock indexes posted strong gains overnight. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 0.14%, and S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1%. Nasdaq Futures fell 0.1%.\n\nOvernight in the U.S., the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.02%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5%. The S&P 500 added 0.62%, hitting a new high for the year so far.\n\nIn macroeconomic developments, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday that the country\u2019s initial jobless claims totaled 261,000 for the week ended June 3. That was the highest weekly level for such claims since October 30, 2021.\n\nThe jobless claims pointing to a slowing of the economy are another factor suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s more than year-long hikes in interest rates are having an effect and may influence the Fed\u2019s decision-making on rates at its meeting on June 14.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 74.8% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged at next week\u2019s meeting, and a 25.2% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "The US federal government has charged two Russian nationals in connection with the series of hacks that brought down the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange in 2014. In a press release on Friday, the Department of Justice announced it\u2019s unsealing a 2019 indictment charging (PDF) Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner with conspiring to launder 647,000 Bitcoins stolen from the exchange, which was worth around $400 million at the time.\n\nThe government is separately charging Bilyuchenko for working with Alexander Vinnik \u2014 who the DOJ indicted in 2017 before he was extradited to the US last fall \u2014 for operating BTC-e, a now-defunct crypto exchange that served as \u201cone of the primary ways by which cyber criminals around the world transferred, laundered, and stored the criminal proceeds of their illegal activities.\u201d\n\nAt the time of Vinnik\u2019s indictment, the government alleged that stolen funds from Mt. Gox passed through BTC-e and wallets associated with Vinnik. Now the DOJ alleges that Bilyuchenko, Verner, and other co-conspirators laundered over 300,000 Bitcoins that had been stolen from Mt. Gox as well.\n\nMt. Gox owner and CEO Mark Karpeles was arrested in 2015 and indicted in Japan on charges including embezzlement and aggravated breach of trust. But in 2019, Karpeles was acquitted on most of them, with a suspended sentence applied for falsifying data. Today he retweeted a post linking to the unsealed indictment.\n\n\u201cAs alleged in the indictments, starting in 2011, Bilyuchenko and Verner stole a massive amount of cryptocurrency from Mt. Gox, contributing to the exchange\u2019s ultimate insolvency,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. says in a statement. \u201cArmed with the ill-gotten gains from Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko allegedly went on to help set up the notorious BTC-e virtual currency exchange, which laundered funds for cyber criminals worldwide.\u201d\n\nWhile Bilyuchenko faces charges with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money services business and over 20 years behind bars, Verner is charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering with a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison."

        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: SEC crackdown on Binance, Coinbase \u2018can\u2019t stop\u2019 Bitcoin as it trades above US$26,000 - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell 2% from June 2 to June 9 to trade at US$26,598 at 7:45 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has traded below US$30,000 since April 19. Ether fell 2.83% over the week to US$1,842.\n\nIt was a tumultuous week for the crypto industry after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance\u2019s U.S. wing for 13 charges related to securities violations, including the unregistered offers and sales of the BNB and BUSD tokens and activity related to its Simple Earn and staking programs.\n\nThe SEC sued Coinbase exchange on Tuesday, a day after initiating its lawsuit against Binance. The regulator alleged that Coinbase made billions of dollars unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities since at least 2019.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the SEC is currently on the hunt for crypto companies. This goes back to the collapse of FTX in 2022, as U.S. regulators would embarrass themselves if a similar scenario were to repeat itself without intervention,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast in a LinkedIn response.\n\n\u201cIt is very likely that more exchanges will be targeted in the coming months. However, going for the big dogs like Binance and Coinbase first seems strategically clever as smaller companies will automatically adapt their activities to the new rules indicated by the outcome of the lawsuits.\u201d\n\nFollowing the lawsuits, Bitcoin briefly dipped to a weekly low of US$25,493 on Tuesday but recovered above US$26,000 the same day.\n\n\u201cThe rapid recovery of crypto prices is due to two reasons. First, lawsuits can\u2019t stop decentralized systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum and therefore do not pose a direct threat to cryptocurrencies. Second, even though the U.S. is an influential global player, these lawsuits should have little impact on other jurisdictions around the world. While holders of U.S. cryptocurrencies sold their shares in a short-lived market panic, many took the opportunity to buy cryptocurrencies at a discount, thus the market quickly recovered,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nJames Wo, the founder and chief executive officer of crypto investment firm DFG, said that market confidence did not take a significant hit from the lawsuits, unlike the panic selling caused by FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\n\u201cIf it falls below US$26,000 again this week, it could be considered a short-term downtrend. Another price to watch is the previous high of US$28,000-28,500. Its break-through can be seen as a short-term bullish signal,\u201d wrote Wo to Forkast.\n\nLucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, said that the SEC\u2019s crackdown occurred given its failure to prevent the FTX collapse and warned of the potential of a more aggressive approach by the regulator.\n\n\u201cIt remains unclear if more exchanges will be targeted in this crackdown. However, it is evident that the SEC is taking a more aggressive approach towards regulating the crypto industry, which may result in more legal actions against other exchanges that fail to comply with securities laws,\u201d Kiely told Forkast.\n\nKiely added that the market\u2019s quick recovery occurred as buyers saw an opportunity to buy the dip.\n\n\u201cSome analysts believe that this is a sign of growing maturity in the cryptocurrency market. In previous years, negative news from regulatory bodies would have caused more significant price drops.\u201d\n\nAdding to global investor concerns, the Eurozone economy officially entered recession as it shrank 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to preliminary estimates of a 0.1% growth, pressured by high inflation and borrowing costs.\n\nMike Ermolaev, founder of blockchain PR firm Outset PR and the author of the interview series \u2018Crypto Opinion with Mike Ermolaev,\u2019 said that a bull run could occur if the SEC loses the lawsuits.\n\n\u201c[The SEC\u2019s actions] appear to be an attempt to cripple the sector, especially in light of the new lawsuit against Coinbase. While cryptocurrency will undoubtedly recover, the road to redemption will be more challenging than ever. Moreover, we must not discount the possibility that unfair regulations could drive crypto into the shadows, taking a significant step backward,\u201d wrote Ermolaev to Forkast.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.1 trillion on Friday at 7:45 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 3.5% from US$1.14 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$515 billion, Bitcoin represented 46.7% of the market while Ether, valued at US$221 billion, accounted for 20%.\n\nSee related article: It\u2019s a fight for the future of money in the US, says Christopher Giancarlo\n\nNotable Movers: LUNC, XRP\n\nTerra\u2019s Luna Classic (LUNC) token was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer in the top 100. LUNC rose 15.27% to US$0.00009811. The token started picking up momentum on Sunday, a day before proposal #11548 passed, which will provide a test environment for the price re-pegging of USTC.\n\nXRP, the cryptocurrency powering the XRP Ledger\u2019s real-time gross settlements, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer. XRP rose 2.3% to US$0.5274, as investors became less concerned with Ripple\u2019s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC after the regulator filed two similar lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nSee related article: Why the US is waging war on Binance, Coinbase\n\nNext Week: Can Bitcoin stay above US$25,350?\n\nInvestors await the release of May\u2019s core Consumer Price Index in the U.S., scheduled for next Tuesday. The inflation data will be published a day before the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest rate decision on Wednesday, where the Fed is expected to pause its interest rate hikes for the first time in over a year, according to over 90% of economists polled by Reuters.\n\nEuropean investors are anticipating the European Central Bank\u2019s next monetary decision, set for next Thursday. Following seven consecutive rate hikes, the bank is expected to hike its key lending rate by 25 basis points, even as higher borrowing costs start to take a toll on the European economy.\n\nA weekly close above US$27,600 in Bitcoin would signal more uptrend, while a close below US$25,350 means more bearish momentum, Johnny Louey, a crypto research analyst at trading platform LiquidityTech Protocol told Forkast in a Telegram message.\n\nYield App\u2019s Kiely said that he only expects significant upward momentum after a close above US$30,500.\n\n\u201cMultiple closes above this number and we could be at the onset of a new bull market. It could trade in the mid-term as low as US$24,000. If it breaks that level, it could continue to trade downwards,\u201c wrote Kiely.\n\nSee related article: What\u2019s next for crypto miners after US debt ceiling deal?"

        "title": "Could Bitcoin Help You Become a Millionaire? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Since July 2010 (the earliest data available from coinmarketcap.com), Bitcoin has produced a ridiculous return of nearly 43,000,000%. That crushes the gains of both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index by insanely wide margins. And it has no doubt made some early adopters extremely wealthy.\n\nEven though Bitcoin has been around for about 14 years, I don't think it's too late to get in on the action. Right now, the price is 61% off its all-time high from November 2021, so there is some heightened pessimism around this top cryptocurrency. But can buying now help you become a millionaire?\n\nGiven enough time, I believe the answer is a resounding \"yes.\"\n\nThere is a clear need for Bitcoin\n\nIt's important to first take a step back and understand why Bitcoin is even needed in the world. Think about citizens dealing with corrupt governments (like Mexico's), or currencies that experience hyperinflation (like in Venezuela), or countries ravaged by war (like Afghanistan). The people in these places can't rely on the current financial systems that are in place. A decentralized form of money that can't be confiscated, that isn't controlled by anyone, and that can be stored on the internet or devices that connect to the web is extremely valuable in these types of situations.\n\nIn the U.S., skeptics would make the argument that there is no need for Bitcoin because we have a robust payments industry and developed capital markets. This misses the point that Bitcoin is a global network. Moreover, we take our working financial infrastructure for granted, while people in other countries struggle with a lack of basic banking services or stable currency.\n\nPlus, Bitcoin does serve a need in the U.S. Some investors and institutions are keen on holding a portion of their wealth in the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. That's because Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million, yet over the past decade, central banks around the world have pumped so much money into the economy to stimulate growth after the Great Recession and throughout the coronavirus pandemic. The more fiat money, or government-backed currency, that there is relative to Bitcoin, the better the prospects for the latter's price appreciation.\n\nThe staggering debt burden of the U.S., which will only be exacerbated by further increases of the national debt ceiling in the future, also tells me that we can't keep interest rates high for too long. This increases the odds of elevated levels of inflation for extended periods of time. Holding Bitcoin makes even more sense with this in mind.\n\nRunning the numbers\n\nBitcoin has a market cap of about $516 billion. But let's say that a decade from now, its entire value equals that of the total value of all the world's gold, or roughly $12.5 trillion. I don't think this scenario is out of the question. As more individuals, corporations, and governments learn about Bitcoin and its attractive properties, it's probable that they would at least store a small fraction of their investable assets or reserves in it.\n\nThis would mean that Bitcoin's price would rise about 25-fold between now and the summer of 2033. This performance would likely crush what investors could earn putting their money in the stock market (or any asset class, for that matter). This projection suggests that a $40,000 investment in Bitcoin today could make someone a millionaire in 10 years' time.\n\nTo be clear, there are a ton of risks to think about. The most pressing one is the threat of governments banning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, making it illegal to buy and own these digital assets. That's something to always keep in mind. Additionally, Bitcoin simply might not be adopted as widely as many hope.\n\nBitcoin could reach that projected value in a much longer time frame, or maybe not at all. The range of outcomes is vast.\n\nNonetheless, the potential is certainly there for Bitcoin to make you a millionaire."

        "content": "JPMorgan analysts say Bitcoin could track gold higher, reaching up to $45,000.\n\nPro traders, as well as commodities analysts, say Bitcoin is too speculative to be considered gold-like.\n\nThe narratives underlie the surging cryptocurrency, which has gained about 50% this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s digital gold comparisons are mounting with the top cryptocurrency trading back around levels last seen in July of last year.\n\nJPMorgan analysts say Bitcoin could track gold higher over the next year. Even as sophisticated investors retreat from the top cryptocurrency, analysts say Bitcoin and gold were viewed as hedges to a \u201ccatastrophic scenario.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: Even non-crypto people are asking \u2018what\u2019s going on\u2019 with Bitcoin\u2019s surge to $30,000\n\nFor crypto natives, Bitcoin has long been framed as a haven outside the traditional finance sector, especially in times of economic and monetary strife. This year\u2019s banking crisis, along with regulatory crackdowns on crypto exchanges, have helped fuel that idea.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nClouding this narrative is that for pro traders, Bitcoin is a risk-on asset. Indeed, Bitcoin has tracked the tech-stock heavy Nasdaq higher \u2014 the Nasdaq has jumped about 28% this year, while Bitcoin has rocketed up about 50%.\n\nBitcoin has enjoyed many narratives over its 14-year history, most dividing insiders and outsiders. The asset\u2019s pseudonymous founder envisaged a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow users to avoid financial institutions.\n\n\u201cBitcoin \u2013 the seminal cryptocurrency \u2013 has been many things over its 14 years of existence: a proof-of-concept, tech plaything, a monetary vehicle for criminals, digital gold, etc.,\u201d Ryan Shea, a crypto economist at Trakx, wrote last month.\n\nThe digital gold narrative for Bitcoin is undergoing a renaissance, Shea added.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nHedges in catastrophic times\n\nBitcoin and gold were viewed as hedges during the US banking crisis in March, JPMorgan said. Institutional investors favoured gold while retail shifted to Bitcoin during the crisis that saw lenders like Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank shutter.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said the banking crisis in the US \u201cexposed the weaknesses of the traditional finance system,\u201d driving crypto natives to Bitcoin. From a macroeconomic perspective, the bailouts of those banks played a role.\n\nNOW READ: Hodling pays off for patient Bitcoin investors with 1,000x returns\n\n\u201cExtra liquidity, that\u2019s the difference,\u201d between the haven narrative and the cryptocurrency\u2019s tendency to mirror more risk-on assets, Markus Thielen, head of crypto research and strategy at Matrixport, told DL News in March. He spoke after news of the US government\u2019s intervention in the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n\u201cIt went risk-on when the Fed provided deposit guarantees and traders realised that liquidity would be pumped into the system,\u201d even as \u201csome parts of the economy are in stress,\u201d including banks, he said. \u201cThis is helping Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nDemand for both\n\nDemand for both may be rising in tandem, with some retail investors buying Bitcoin as a speculative play, while others buy gold for \u201call the usual reasons,\u201d Metals Focus analysts told DL News.\n\n\u201cWe would still not go as far as saying Bitcoin is a \u2018digital\u2019 form of gold even though they may have benefitted from the same drivers recently,\u201d they added, noting that gold, the S&P 500 and Bitcoin have rallied together in the past, and, \u201cnobody says stocks are the new gold.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is too speculative in nature with too many structural unknowns to be considered gold-like, Metals Focus analysts added, noting that the exchange\u2019s collapse can drive the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation with gold turned negative today for the first time since March.\n\nBitcoin's correlation to gold just turned negative (Kaiko)\n\nPro traders and their crypto-native counterparts are also dealing with signs of the dollar\u2019s eroding hegemony.\n\n\u201cAs the de-dollarization narrative starts to take shape, it would be rational to expect both risk assets and gold to perform, which would act as a secular tailwind for Bitcoin,\u201d Jonah Van Bourg, global head of trading at DRW\u2019s Cumberland, told DL News.\n\nNOW READ: Bitcoin becomes haven during bank bloodbath with 28% surge: \u2018Extra liquidity, that\u2019s the difference\u2019\n\nBitcoin will eventually trade on its own fundamentals, Ed Moya, senior markets analyst at Oanda told DL News. \u201cIt might not necessarily end up being digital gold,\u201d he added. \u201cWe could see a strong divergence\u201d next year.\n\nInstitutions ditch Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin might be a gold-like play in the eyes of retail investors, but sophisticated traders have been decreasing their holdings over the past two years.\n\nJPMorgan took wallets holding less than 10 BTC as a proxy for retail investors, and those with more than 10 BTC as a proxy for institutional investors \u2013\u2013 which includes family offices and wealthy individuals, asset managers, crypto exchanges, Bitcoin miners, funds, ETFs, and early Bitcoin investors.\n\nRetail traders have increased holdings this year, while institutional holdings have steadily declined.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the institutional impulse has been declining since 2022,\u201d JPMorgan said last week.\n\nOn-chain Bitcoin flows, retail vs. institutions (JPMorgan)\n\n\u201cRetail investors\u2019 demand for bitcoin is likely to strengthen as we approach the April 2024 halving event,\u201d JPMorgan said.

Price is currently retesting the Neckline after the breakout,\u201d Mikybull Crypto explained.\n\n\u201cAs taught, if the range between the head and neckline is usually the sprint, we are anticipating another 60% rally on BTC.\u201d\n\nThat 60% \u201csprint\u201d would place BTC/USD at around $40,000.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

Expect $BTC to go sideways between 20-40k for about 12 months which is when we accumulate as much Bitcoin as we can. Once the halving hits, we start our next bull run to 100k+ into 2025.

Gox in 2011, laundering bitcoin from the hack, and operating an illicit crypto exchange of their own.\n\nKey Takeaways DOJ alleges that Alexey Bilyuchenko and Aleksandr Verner laundered bitcoin linked to the infamous Mt. Gox hack.\n\nThe funds were allegedly used to establish another exchange called BTC-e, which gained popularity among criminal networks.\n\nThe DOJ alleges that the accused engaged in fraudulent contracts with a New York-based bitcoin broker to launder the stolen bitcoins.\n\nMt. Gox collapsed in 2014, leaving users with substantial financial losses and ongoing uncertainty regarding the distribution of remaining assets from the Mt. Gox estate. The charges may lead to the recovery of more funds for Mt. Gox's victims.\n\nLaundering the Proceeds from the Mt. Gox Hack\n\nIn September 2011, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their accomplices allegedly accessed the server hosting the cryptocurrency wallets of Mt. Gox, by far the largest bitcoin exchange at the time. With unauthorized access, they allegedly transferred bitcoins from Mt. Gox's wallets to their own controlled bitcoin addresses.\n\nOver the span of approximately three years, from September 2011 to May 2014, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators are said to have stolen around 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox. The stolen bitcoins were allegedly laundered through bitcoin addresses associated with accounts controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their accomplices on two other online bitcoin exchanges, as well as through a specific user account on Mt. Gox itself.\n\n\n\nThe DOJ's allegations also suggest that the accused individuals engaged in fraudulent contracts with a New York-based bitcoin broker to launder the stolen bitcoins originating from Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in 2014, resulting in significant financial losses for numerous users who are still waiting for the distribution of the remaining assets from the Mt. Gox estate.\n\n\n\nAnother Russian national, Alexander Vinnik, was previously charged with operating BTC-e in 2017."

        "content": "After a period of relative calm, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) kicked off its summer crypto crackdown by targeting two major exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.\n\nA total of 13 charges have been filed against Binance. One of the allegations in the suit claims that funds from Binance and Binance.US were commingled into an account controlled by the Changpeng Zhao-associated company, Merit Peak.\n\nAs for Coinbase, the SEC claims it has been offering unregistered securities and was never registered as a broker, securities exchange or clearing agency. Many in the crypto industry have been puzzled by the allegations against Coinbase, primarily because it is a publicly-traded company and received a previous green light from the regulator.\n\nWhile not surprising, this week\u2019s developments again shed light on the dubious practices of the SEC toward the crypto space, as it claimed companies failed to register with the regulator, despite the absence of a path to do so. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the latest string of lawsuits is an attempt by the SEC to \u201cdistract\u201d from the agency\u2019s \u201cFTX debacle\u201d Let\u2019s not forget the SEC has not sued FTX, although it has charged its founder and former executives.\n\nThe crypto space has seen sell-offs in tokens and stocks, services halted and heightened uncertainty in recent days, but these events may also bring something that the industry is eager for \u2014 legal clarity.\n\nAlong with the recent wave of lawsuits, this week\u2019s Crypto Biz also explores Apple\u2019s new headset moving beyond the metaverse, Brazil\u2019s Mercado Bitcoin gets the green light for its fintech payments arm, and how European Union regulators are targeting fake news generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nSEC complaint hints at why Brian Brooks resigned as Binance\u200b.US CEO\n\nThe SEC\u2019s latest complaint against Binance could explain why former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks chose to step down in August 2021, only three months after his appointment. According to legal sources, the complaint cites an \u201cunnamed source\u201d who ran Binance.US for a brief period in 2021. The dates correlate with the time that Brooks was CEO of the company. Brooks \u2014 a former top banking regulator \u2014 led operations at the crypto exchange after replacing former CEO Catherine Coley. According to comments cited in the complaint, Brooks quickly realized that he was \u201cnot actually the one running this company.\u201d Upon recognizing this, he decided to leave, announcing his resignation just three months later.\n\n1/ The SEC complaint against @Binance appears to solve the mystery of why Brian Brooks abruptly resigned as CEO of @BinanceUS in 2021.\n\n\n\nCZ allegedly reneged on promises that Brooks would be given autonomy to run https://t.co/reBq6K7KAs independently from @Binance. \u2014 MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) June 5, 2023\n\nBrazilian crypto exchange Mercado Bitcoin licensed as payment provider\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Mercado Bitcoin was granted a payment provider license from Brazil\u2019s central bank on June 2. With the license, the company will launch its fintech solution MB Pay. The fintech arm will provide Brazilian users with specific digital banking services using crypto assets held on the exchange, such as digital fixed-income investments, staking and other financial transactions. A debit card offering a crypto off-ramp for users is expected to go live soon. Global crypto exchanges operating in Brazil\u2019s market include Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com and Bitso.\n\nApple\u2019s Vision Pro headset reveal swaps metaverse for \u2018spatial computing\u2019\n\nApple\u2019s newly revealed mixed-reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, has turned tech-enthusiast heads in the past few days. The company, however, deliberately labeled its technology the first \u201cspatial computer\u201d to move away from the metaverse concept and differentiate its virtual reality tool from competitors. Apple\u2019s marketing is focused on the words \u201cspatial\u201d and \u201cspatial computing\u201d rather than words such as \u201cmetaverse,\u201d \u201cAR,\u201d and \u201cVR.\u201d A clear step away from Microsoft\u2019s Hololens and Meta\u2019s headsets. Apple\u2019s headset will be launched in the U.S. in early 2024, for a hefty retail price of $3,499, before expanding internationally.\n\nUsing apps with Apple Vision Pro.

According to EU officials, companies deploying generative AI tools should label their content to combat fake news. The statement comes as the EU prepares its forthcoming Artificial Intelligence Act, which will be a comprehensive set of guidelines for the public use of AI and the companies deploying it. Major tech companies, including Google, Microsoft and Meta Platforms, have already signed onto the EU\u2019s 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation.\n\nCrypto Biz is your weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday."

        "title": "Delaware Bankruptcy Court Approves DIP Financing of 700 Bitcoin - The National Law Review",
        "content": "On May 8, 2023, online cryptocurrency exchange platform Bittrex, Inc. and three of its affiliated entities (collectively \u201cBittrex\u201d) filed for chapter 11 to wind down their U.S. and long-dormant Malta operations. The bankruptcy filing followed costly regulatory investigations and an April 17, 2023 SEC enforcement action alleging that Bittrex improperly sold crypto assets that were securities. Unlike other crypto bankruptcies, Bittrex did not risk, hypothecate, or loan cryptocurrencies needed to meet its contractual obligations to its customers. Instead, since March 31, 2023, Bittrex had been urging its 5.4 million customers to withdraw their cryptocurrency deposits. Bittrex\u2019s ultimate goal in its case is to pay all customer\u2019s claims in full as soon as possible.\n\nWhat is particularly interesting about the Bittrex case is that for the first time, on June 7, 2023, a bankruptcy court authorized a debtor to obtain postpetition financing solely in bitcoin (\u201cBTC\u201d) from the DIP lender.\n\nDIP Financing Motion\n\nBittrex filed a postpetition financing motion on the petition date requesting that Bittrex\u2019s ultimate parent company, Aquila Holdings Inc. (\u201cAquila\u201d), be authorized to issue a DIP loan of 700 BTC to Bittrex. The DIP financing agreement provides that Aquila is entitled to a non-priming, super-priority administrative claim pursuant to section 364(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (i.e., higher priority over any and all administrative expense claims), but does not grant Aquila a security interest in any of Bittrex\u2019s assets. Bittrex intends to use the DIP loan to fund the bankruptcy case and make distributions of cryptocurrency holdings to its former customers.\n\nThere were several reasons why Aquila required the DIP loan to consist exclusively of BTC rather than fiat currency. First, in the crypto industry it is common for participants to borrow funds in BTC. Second, after fiat banking services provider Silvergate Bank closed, it became very difficult for a cryptocurrency firm in wind-down mode to access fiat currency. And perhaps most importantly, Aquila would face negative tax consequences if it was required to liquidate its BTC, which would greatly increase the expense of Bittrex\u2019s DIP loan.\n\nAccording to the financing motion, once Bittrex receives the BTC from Aquila, Bittrex will promptly convert the BTC into U.S. dollars to minimize the risk of currency rate fluctuations. Bittrex will then use the BTC proceeds to pay administrative expenses in accordance with the budget attached to the motion. Bittrex will need to repay the DIP loan principal no later than nine months after the interim order was entered (i.e., February 10, 2024), and the principal portion of the DIP loan must be repaid in BTC. Any other obligations, like the 4% interest per annum, may be repaid in BTC, U.S. dollars, or any combination thereof. To protect Bittrex against BTC price fluctuations between the time of borrowing and maturity, Bittrex negotiated a cap on the amount of additional BTC it may need to acquire to pay any shortfall. Specifically, Bittrex is only required to pay Aquila BTC equal to 110% of the value of the shortfall on the petition date. In other words, Bittrex is protected in the event the price of BTC rises after the petition date by only needing to pay Aquila up to 110% of the value of BTC advanced on the petition date.\n\nFor example, on the petition date the value of BTC in U.S. dollars was $28,611.44. The DIP loan is for 700 BTC, which means that on the maturity date Bittrex needs to repay 700 BTC to Aquila. If the price of BTC remained stable during the nine-month period, then Bittrex would need $20,028,008 worth of BTC to repay the DIP loan. But because the price of BTC constantly changes, if the price per BTC skyrockets following the petition date, Bittrex would only need to pay Aquila $22,030,808.80 of BTC (i.e., 110% of the value of BTC on the petition date) to satisfy the principal obligation, thus capping its risk.\n\nTakeaways\n\nBittrex\u2019s DIP financing is relatively non-controversial \u2013 it does not include a rollup, does not prime any preexisting debt, does not impose a security interest against any assets, only includes a 4% interest rate per annum, meaningfully caps any upside Aquila may receive for postpetition increases in BTC valuation, and authorizes Bittrex to recognize any price savings if the value of BTC falls after the petition date. What may appear to be unique, at least for bankruptcy purposes, is that the loan is in BTC, although entities in the crypto industry commonly lend and borrow cryptocurrencies from one another. As crypto firms continue to file bankruptcy, Bittrex\u2019s DIP facility may serve as a template for firms that intend to borrow BTC or other cryptocurrencies to finance their cases.\n\nBankruptcy practitioners can now seek to expand the scenarios for when BTC or other cryptocurrency DIP financing is acceptable in other cases. Debtors may begin to seek financing with more obscure cryptocurrencies or negotiate more complicated risk-transferring procedures to account for postpetition currency valuation fluctuations. For example, to obtain a lower interest rate or more value, debtors may agree to (i) a higher cap for a lender to obtain a larger principal payment (when valuations increase postpetition), and/or (ii) limit the floor of how large of a principal discount the debtor may obtain (when valuations drop postpetition).\n\nThe future has just begun to present creative cryptocurrency DIP financing solutions to debtors and lenders."
