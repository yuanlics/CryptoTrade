        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), sought comments on a rule change that will allow it to decide the fate of spot Bitcoin (BTCUSD) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), effectively delaying the call on approving Ark Invest's Ark21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\n\nKey Takeaways The SEC has delayed a decision on the Ark21 Shares Bitcoin ETF, as the regulatory agency gathers more public comments regarding one of the amendments in the application.\n\nThis delay could push a decision on the Bitcoin spot ETF into 2024.\n\nWhile a number of bitcoin ETFs based around futures products already exist, a large number of spot-based bitcoin ETF applications were recently submitted following a new proposal from BlackRock.\n\nThe SEC's Decision to Delay\n\nThe SEC has invited public comments on the Ark21 Shares Bitcoin ETF proposal, a joint project from ARK Invest and 21 Shares. Specifically, the SEC would like interested parties to share their views on whether a spot bitcoin ETF may be susceptible to manipulation and whether the levels of liquidity and transparency in the bitcoin market are sufficient to avoid potential manipulation.\n\nThe SEC's original deadline for a decision on the spot bitcoin ETF application was August 13. Now, a final decision may get kicked into 2024. The SEC has previously rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications; however, several bitcoin ETFs based on futures contracts already exist.\n\n\n\nThe Ark21Shares Bitcoin ETF would track the performance of bitcoin as measured by the S&P Bitcoin Index, which uses data from several crypto exchanges. The fund would hold bitcoin directly and be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nEarlier this month, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood predicted that her firm and 21 Shares's proposal would be delayed by the SEC in an interview with Bloomberg. Additionally, Wood predicted several spot bitcoin ETFs would eventually be approved simultaneously.\n\nAll Eyes on Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Application\n\nA slew of spot bitcoin ETF proposals were made in June after Blackrock (BLK) entered the fray for the first time with their proposal. Many market commentators saw BlackRock's entry into the spot bitcoin ETF market as a sign that approval from the SEC could be around the corner due to their pivotal role in the U.S. financial system.\n\nEarlier this week, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz claimed his contacts at BlackRock indicated they expected approval on their spot bitcoin ETF proposal within six months.\n\nWhile the SEC has taken a more critical approach to the crypto industry this year, bitcoin has mostly remained immune to the crackdown, as it is the only crypto asset that current chair Gary Gensler has clearly stated is not a security."

The regulator said in a filing Friday that it is seeking public comment on one of the amendments in the application for the exchange-traded fund, effectively pushing out the date a decision is needed for approval. The process may now stretch into 2024.\n\nThe Ark 21Shares fund is seen as the first in line for a potential bitcoin ETF launch, though the SEC could choose to approve many funds at roughly the same time if it does decide to allow them. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood told Bloomberg News earlier this week that she expected the SEC to make a decision on multiple funds at once.\n\nApplications from other major organizations, including BlackRock and WisdomTree, have already been filed. Crypto investment firm Grayscale is still awaiting a court decision after the SEC repeatedly rejected its proposal to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nThe Cboe BZX exchange filed with the SEC for a rule change in April that would allow the listing of the Ark21 spot bitcoin fund. The filing has since been amended several times and now includes a surveillance-sharing provision that was introduced in BlackRock's filing for a bitcoin fund.\n\nThe SEC has rejected dozens of prior applications to create a spot bitcoin ETF, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler appeared to be leading a crackdown against the crypto industry earlier this year.\n\nBut there are signs that momentum is shifting toward the crypto industry, including a partial legal victory for Ripple that cast doubt on the SEC's efforts to classify most crypto assets as securities.\n\nThe SEC has already allowed the launch of several bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was little changed Friday, trading above $29,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Exploring BTC trends \u2013 is Bitcoin entering its industrial phase? - TechHQ",
        "content": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has its fans and critics. And to understand what makes this cryptocurrency so polarizing, it\u2019s worth investing a small amount of time in unpacking the concept of money. By doing so, you can appreciate the opportunities and concerns on both sides of the digital coin, as well as gain a perspective on potential BTC trends over the longer term.\n\nGoing back centuries, civilizations have purchased goods and services using various means, including exchanging livestock and paying in shells. Fast forward to today, and we have trusted fiat currencies such as the US dollar, EURO, British Pound, and Chinese Yuan.\n\nAnd while digital payments increasingly dominate, technically \u2013 for example, in the case of the British Pound issued by the Bank of England \u2013 it is the physical notes and coins that represent the promise of payment from the central bank to the bearer of the currency.\n\nThis begs the question as to why people are so happy to give their money to retail banks and send funds electronically \u2013 if those numbers in the various accounts aren\u2019t, strictly speaking, legal tender. And the answer is that those traditional financial services have government backing.\n\n\u201cMaking a deposit into a bank or building society account is like giving your trust to that organisation,\u201d writes the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which monitors banks and building societies in the UK. \u201cYou trust that it will look after your money and, when you want to access that money again, it will be there.\u201d\n\nCustomers of conventional financial institutions have protection up to a certain value. And while this oversight and government backing is mostly successful in keeping the wheels of traditional finance turning \u2013 the promise of payment is only directly tied to the cash in your pocket.\n\nPlus \u2013 as wobbles throughout history have shown \u2013 if confidence in the ability of the government to control its finances dips, so does the value of that promise to pay the bearer. And when times are shaky, investors reach instead for gold, which has been seen to hold its value during turbulent times.\n\nAnd this brings the discussion to the idea of cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin\u2019s main fork, dubbed Bitcoin Core (BTC), which some advocate has the potential to become a kind of \u2018digital gold\u2019.\n\nHow does BTC work and what is crypto mining?\n\nThe best way to understand crypto mining is to simply look at a block in the BTC blockchain. And there are a couple of key details to focus on. The first is the hash, indicated in the screengrab below by a green arrow, and the second is the so-called \u2018nonce\u2019.\n\nA hash digest is a fixed-length code that\u2019s commonly used as an integrity check on digital files. The one-way function generates a unique fingerprint of a file\u2019s contents. And, if the hash function is truly collision-proof, then no two inputs will produce the same output.\n\nFor example, if you apply a SHA256 hash (the function used to digest blocks when crypto mining BTC) to the phrase \u2018Helloworld\u2019 you get \u2013\n\n5ab92ff2e9e8e609398a36733c057e4903ac6643c646fbd9ab12d0f6234c8daf\n\nBut if we re-run the SHA256 hash on \u2018Helloworld+1\u2019, the one-way function generates a different code, or fingerprint \u2013\n\n4865d2b4b49f88cc5a721fdc7ff210878f657219d5a768e317134b66a18a4605\n\nAnd this tells us quickly that the input (which, rather than our simple example, could instead be a GB-sized file and hence enable rapid integrity checks for software such as large operating system updates) has been modified. Also, while the fingerprint is impossible to predict, we can engineer patterns in the output by adding random values to the input.\n\nIn our case and sticking with the SHA256 algorithm, if we try \u2018Helloworld+1580358748\u2019, we get \u2013\n\n5a0506dd28159d6d8bb1e1e2a3edc4d10e1fa2519193726e9bff6960887a2aa2\n\nAnd you\u2019ll notice that adding \u20181580358748\u2019 to the list of cryptocurrency transactions comprising BTC block #802502 (plus a hash of the previous block, to secure the blockchain) produces a string of zeros at the front of the hash digest \u2013\n\n00000000000000000001a3c8e6069d5a7d7c7236c91953bfd356794211151b04\n\nFinding a suitable \u2018nonce\u2019, which can be added to a block so that its hash has a string of preceding zeros, gets to the heart of bitcoin mining. And although the exercise may sound a little abstract, it gives BTC coins \u2013 which are issued to the crypto miner that\u2019s first to solve the challenge for each block \u2013 their scarcity.\n\nWith the blocks themselves representing sequences of transactions, stamped with an integrity check thanks to the hash functions, we now have the makings of a digital currency. What\u2019s more, if a bad actor wanted to rewrite history and change any of the entries on the digital ledger, the hash would fail to match due to the modified contents.\n\nPlus, coming up with new \u2018nonces\u2019 \u2013 which is a trial and error process \u2013 represents too big a challenge were adversaries to try and cover their tracks.\n\nDigital gold, or not?\n\nLikening BTC to gold serves as a useful comparison in picturing a possible role for future cryptocurrencies. Although, time has yet to pass the same degree of judgement on BTC, with gold having been accepted for thousands of years as a trusted store of value.\n\n\u201cBitcoin and gold are similar from both a psychological perspective and, especially, as a resource,\u201d write the economists Wolfgang H\u00e4rdle, Campbell Harvey, and Raphael Reule in a useful discussion paper on \u2018Understanding Cryptocurrencies\u2019 [PDF]. \u201cNeither can be created arbitrarily: each must be mined and each has a finite supply (at least on planet Earth)\u201d.\n\nREAD NEXT Blockchain token economy secures swarm robots\n\nSimilarly, just as it takes energy to extract gold from rock buried underground, it typically requires a vast number of guesses before crypto miners discover a suitable nonce. The probability of an input generating an output with zero as the first digit is 1 in 16 (the hash digest is hexadecimal). But to find 19 leading zeros, as in the hash digest of BTC block #802502, drops that likelihood to just (1/16)19 \u2013 an incredibly small number.\n\nThe probability of successfully hashing a new block is many times less than winning a national lottery. But, of course, crypto miners can (sticking with the example of a lottery) buy trillions of tickets per second to boost their chances of hitting upon a valid guess.\n\nLooking at the hash rate for BTC \u2013 the number of guesses being made on finding a suitable nonce value \u2013 that figure is more than 382 million per second, and it\u2019s measured in units of terahashes (1 trillion guesses).\n\nIn the physical world, mining equipment is big and bulky and requires industrial scale power. And the analogy holds for digital crypto mining rigs too. To be competitive, crypto miners need pools of computing hardware that\u2019s been designed specifically for the task.\n\nUnits such as Bitmain\u2019s popular S19 model, which is specified as delivering a hashrate of 151 terahashes per second (TH/s) and consumes more than 3kW of power at the wall, are whirring away all over the world (where allowed) to validate BTC transactions on a decentralized digital ledger.\n\nLong-term BTC trends\n\nCritics of such a consensus mechanism, dubbed proof-of-work, point to the power that\u2019s consumed. But, without coming down on either side of the fence, it should be noted that managing traditional currencies consumes energy too. There\u2019s a vast amount of backend services supporting modern banking operations, and it\u2019s the price to pay for running systems that customers trust.\n\nAs mentioned, the use of gold goes back thousands of years, which is ages long compared with the not-yet two-decade-old practice of BTC crypto mining. We live in interesting times with ambitious projects to deliver zero-knowledge proof, privacy-preserving World IDs, and the boom in AI.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of the unknown when new technologies emerge, and it\u2019s fair to say that cryptocurrencies occupy that space. Parallels with the utility of gold may serve as a guide on how the story of BTC plays out, but time will tell whether Bitcoin has similar appeal, and that clock has only just started ticking."

        "content": "STEVENS POINT, Wis. (WBAY) - Stevens Point police, firefighters, and UPS saved a woman from losing $16,000 to scam.\n\nStevens Point police say scammers emailed a 79-year-old woman that she had bogus charges on her PayPal account. Through an elaborate scheme, they directed her to withdraw money from her bank and deposit it at a Bitcoin cryptocurrency ATM.\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work, she tried sending the $16,000 in cash through UPS to an address in Texas.\n\n\u201cShe made multiple attempts to deposit money in the machines and then she went to mail it through UPS. They told her they thought she was being victimized, and they took her package -- they weren\u2019t going to mail her package -- and they let their investigators know, and then that is how we got involved,\u201d Stevens Point Police Lt. Joe Johnson said.\n\nThe woman was able to deposit the money in the cryptocurrency ATM eventually.\n\nUsing a search warrant, police and firefighters were able to get into the machine and find the woman\u2019s cash.\n\nOur sister station WSAW reports two more people came to the same Bitcoin ATM to deposit large sums of money while detectives were investigating the first case. Police stopped them before they lost any money. The would-be victims were told similar stories as the first woman.\n\nPolice say the scammers had also directed the older woman to buy gift cards, send the cards to them and cut up all the receipts.\n\nStevens Point police say these scams seem to involve messages received through email or text saying there is a problem with a financial account, their computer has been hacked, or that their account shows evidence of child pornography or other criminal activities. Once the victim makes contact with the scammers on the phone, they are told there are fraudulent charges on their accounts.\n\nScammers seemed to know the correct balance of the victims\u2019 bank accounts, making the scam more believable to the victims. They might have accessed that information through spyware.\n\nAs we told you in a Consumer First Alert about investment scams, consumer experts say many of these scams go unreported because people are embarrassed. It\u2019s important to talk to your friends, parents, and grandparents about these scams and how they work. Remind them it\u2019s not their fault and if they\u2019re a victim to report it to the police.\n\nCopyright 2023 WBAY. All rights reserved."

The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly rose above US$30,000 twice this week, before falling below the support level. Ether rgained 0.72% over the week to US$1,846, remaining below the US$1,900 support level since July 23.\n\n\u201cBitcoin began the week quietly. In recent months, crypto volatility has somewhat lessened as investors view the stock market as a better trading vehicle due to the fact that there has been better price action on the stock market,\u201d Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\nMonday brought some much-needed excitement to the crypto space after California-based payments giant PayPal announced the launch of its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The company said that PayPal USD (PYUSD) aims to bridge the gap between fiat currencies and the blockchain for consumers and merchants.\n\n\u201cPaypal has joined an impressive list of major financial institutions which are entering the crypto market,\u201d Alex Konanykhin, the chief executive officer and founder of Unicoin, an equity-backed crypto that pays dividends, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThis trend is a major distinction of the current crypto rally from the previous ones, which were fueled by individual crypto enthusiasts.\u201d\n\nBitcoin briefly rose to a weekly high of US$30,144 on Wednesday, two days after PayPal\u2019s announcement, but fell below US$30,000 later that day.\n\nPayPal\u2019s new stablecoin will make it easier for the masses to gain exposure to Bitcoin, according to Phillip Lord, president of crypto payment app Oobit.\n\n\u201cPayPal\u2019s stablecoin is massive news. It will bring a lot more American users into the market for payments and day-to-day use, which will filter into the rest of the [crypto] ecosystem,\u201c said Lord, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase Global announced the public launch of its Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Base.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report released on Thursday showed that inflation rose 3.2% from a year ago in July, with core CPI excluding food and energy prices also increasing 0.2% for the month, matching preliminary estimates.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.17 trillion on Friday at 7:20 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 0.86% from US$1.16 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$571 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.8% of the market while Ether, valued at US$221 billion, accounted for 18.9%.\n\nNotable Movers: SHIB, RUNE\n\nThe Shiba Inu memecoin was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 16.75% to US$$0.00001002. The memecoin started picking up momentum last Friday, as investors anticipated the launch of Shibarium, an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, scheduled for the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto Aug. 13-17.\n\nRune, the native governance token of the ThorChain network, was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 15.95% to US$1.08. Rune started its price rally on Tuesday, after ThorWallet announced the introduction of Visa Cards and Swiss bank accounts for users.\n\nAs for the week\u2019s biggest losers, XDC Network\u2019s (XDC) token fell 19.32% to US$0.06616, followed by GMX decentralized exchange\u2019s (GMX) token that declined 12.91% to US$45.11.\n\nSee related article: USDT\u2019s goal is to be the dollar, not beat it, says Tether CTO\n\nNext Week: Can Bitcoin close the week above US$29,300?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s major weekly support lies at US$29,300, according to Aziz Kenjaev, financial analyst and director of business development at cross-chain liquidity protocol Entangle.\n\n\u201cAs for the technical analysis, there\u2019s still room for the continuation of a correction down to US$28,600 if Bitcoin closes below US$29,300,\u201d Kenjaev told Forkast, referencing the below chart.\n\nNext week, investors await the release of the minutes of July\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, for insight on the U.S. Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest in 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 89% chance of no interest rate hike in September, up from 87% on Thursday.\n\nIn the crypto space, Canada\u2019s ETH Toronto hackathon will open its gates on Tuesday, with notable speakers like Cosmos co-founder Ethan Buchman and pseudonymous Shiba Inu founder Shytoshi Kusama.\n\nSee related article: Hackers hit Curve, China announces blockchain link & is FTX back?"

        "content": "PayPal is venturing deeper into the world of cryptocurrency payments with the launch of a new \"stablecoin\" whose value is designed to track the U.S. dollar.\n\nIt's the latest move by PayPal to beef up its crypto offerings. A year ago, the service began allowing users to transfer cryptocurrencies in and out of their accounts from other users or crypto wallets \u2014 a core feature of many popular crypto exchanges.\n\nThe platform\u2019s crypto functionality still does not have all of the features of dedicated crypto marketplaces, which offer wider selections of cryptocurrency and often offer more advanced types of transactions.\n\nBut for casual users who are familiar with PayPal, the service can be a convenient way to buy and sell crypto, and to use your coins to make purchases from participating businesses.\n\nAdvertisement Coinbase Robinhood Crypto Webull Pay NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Its pricing structure is similar to Venmo\u2019s: Fees amount to $2.49 on a $200 purchase, plus an estimated 0.5% trading cost based on the coin\u2019s exchange rate, a moderately high charge when compared with that of other platforms.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about buying, selling and transferring cryptocurrency with PayPal.\n\nBuying Bitcoin with PayPal\n\nIn order to buy Bitcoin with PayPal \u2014 or any of the other cryptocurrencies offered by the service \u2014 you'll need a verified account known as a PayPal Balance account.\n\nIf you're a regular user of PayPal, you may already have one of these accounts, which are required to use many of the platform's services. PayPal requires users with balance accounts to verify information including their name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number [0] View all sources PayPal.com . PayPal Balance Terms and Conditions\n\nAlso, keep in mind that PayPal doesn\u2019t support crypto transactions in Hawaii, and business accounts can\u2019t participate.\n\nIf you have an eligible account, here's how you can buy cryptocurrency on PayPal:\n\n1. Go to the \u201cFinances\u201d tab, which can be found at the top of your screen on desktop and at the bottom of the home screen on the mobile app with this icon:\n\nFrom there, you can select the \u201cCrypto\u201d tab.\n\n(Image courtesy of PayPal Newsroom)\n\n2. On the Crypto page, you can view the market prices of assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). You can select your desired currency to view a price graph and the \u201cBuy\u201d button.\n\n3. Make sure your identity is verified. If you need help, this support page outlines the steps. You may need to accept PayPal\u2019s cryptocurrency terms and conditions before you continue, and you\u2019ll likely have to submit a few identification documents to confirm your home address, name and date of birth as well as a photo of your face.\n\n4. Enter your desired dollar amount and select \u201cNext.\u201d You\u2019ll get the chance to double-check how much crypto you\u2019re purchasing, plus any fees that will be added.\n\nThe maximum limit for crypto purchases is $100,000 per week. You can buy as little as 0.01 BCH, ETH and LTC and as little as 0.001 of BTC.\n\n5. Choose your payment method. You can use a debit card, linked bank account or any funds in your PayPal balance.\n\n6. Select \u201cBuy\u201d to confirm. PayPal updates the market value of all four currencies every few seconds, so the value you see right when you choose \u201cBuy\u201d is the amount you\u2019ll receive.\n\nPayPal cryptocurrency fees\n\nPayPal cryptocurrency purchases include a \u201cspread,\u201d meaning you\u2019ll pay slightly more than the market price when buying and get slightly less than the market price when selling. This margin is around 0.5% and depends on market conditions.\n\nOn top of the spread, PayPal charges the following transaction fees based on the purchase amount:\n\nPurchase amount Fee $1.00 - $4.99 $0.49. $5.00 - $24.99 $0.99. $25.00 - $74.99 $1.99. $75.00 - $200.00 $2.49. $200.01 - $1,000.00 1.80%. >$1,000.00 1.50%.\n\nHolding crypto on PayPal\n\nThere are no fees for holding crypto on PayPal. You can view the amount of crypto you hold, and its market value, in the same tab you used to purchase.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to hold a significant amount of crypto, a wallet is a more secure option.\n\n\u00bb Ready for a wallet? Here are our top picks\n\nSelling crypto on PayPal\n\nOnce you have crypto assets in your PayPal account, you\u2019ll be able to view the current price and sell through the same tab. The fees for selling are the same as the fees for purchases: a per-transaction fee, plus the 0.5% market spread.\n\nProceeds from the sale will go to your PayPal account, where you can use the funds to make purchases or transfer them to your bank account.\n\nTransferring crypto into your PayPal address\n\nSelect your chosen coin in the Crypto tab and use the transfers button to move coins into PayPal from an outside source. The platform doesn\u2019t charge fees for transferring, but your wallet or exchange may charge a sender fee. The transfers button looks like this:\n\nYou may need to confirm your tax information, including your Social Security number, before continuing. Once verified, you can select \u201cReceive.\u201d\n\nPayPal will generate a unique address for your transfer, which you can copy and paste manually or share with a QR code. As with any crypto transfer, make sure you input this address correctly. Coins sent to the wrong address can\u2019t be recovered.\n\nThe address generated will work for only this specific transfer; this is not a private key.\n\n\u00bb Learn more about private keys: How to get a crypto wallet\n\nTransferring crypto from your PayPal wallet\n\nSelect your chosen coin in the Crypto tab and use the transfers button to send your crypto out of PayPal into an external wallet. Again, PayPal doesn\u2019t charge a specific fee for transfers, but you\u2019ll likely be charged a blockchain network fee, which applies to most crypto transactions between platforms.\n\nIf your identity is verified, you can select \u201cSend\u201d and enter the wallet address where you want to send your crypto. Similar to the receiving feature, you can copy and paste the address or scan a QR code to ensure you enter it correctly.\n\nSending crypto to another PayPal user\n\nSending crypto to another PayPal user is easier than transferring it in or out of the platform, and there are no fees, including the blockchain network fee.\n\nChoose the coin in your Crypto tab and use the transfers button to send coins to another user.\n\nSelect \u201cSend\u201d and choose the user you\u2019re sending to in your PayPal contacts. You\u2019ll be able to double-check the amount and the destination before you confirm.\n\nPayPal cryptocurrency alerts\n\nThe PayPal app can send push notifications that alert users to crypto price changes. You can customize these alerts with a specific currency and the desired percentage price increase or drop: 5%, 8% or 10%. Crypto alerts can be found in the app\u2019s settings under the bell icon.\n\nDoes PayPal offer tax forms?\n\nYes, PayPal will provide users with any necessary 1099 forms and report the same information to the IRS. All crypto sales on PayPal are taxable.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place Find ways to save more by tracking your income and net worth on NerdWallet. Sign Up\n\nWhat protections does PayPal offer?\n\nLike with other exchanges, your crypto funds on PayPal aren\u2019t eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. coverage, which would normally protect up to the first $250,000 in deposits.\n\nPayPal Buyer Protection also doesn\u2019t apply to cryptocurrency purchases, though PayPal says crypto purchases will be protected from unauthorized activity. In the event of an unauthorized transfer, you may be eligible for reimbursement up to the equivalent of $50,000.\n\nIf you suspect fraudulent activity on your account, PayPal says you should file a claim through the customer resolution center."

        "content": "The producer price index rose 0.3% in July which was hotter than expected. Joining us now to discuss how the crypto markets are reacting is innovating capital, general partner, Anthony Georgia. Welcome to the show. Anthony, thanks for having me. Great to be here. Awesome to have you here. I just said we're going to take a look at how the crypto markets are reacting, but we took a look at a few charts at the beginning of the show and it looks like they are relatively unmoved. Are you surprised to see that this morning? Uh It is a little bit interesting, you know, when you look at futures right now in the equities market, you know, NASDAQ looks like it's down almost, you know, 70 basis points S and P is down about 25 30 basis points. And, you know, I think the data between yesterday and today um starts to really kind of signal fears that, you know, there might not necessarily be so much of a soft economic landing here and that, you know, potentially the guidance and certainty in terms of where terminal rates will shake out on a monetary policy perspective is a little uneasy now. Um Just given the fact that it does seem that costs more than anything are going to stay where they are for quite some time on the digital asset side. It's fascinating to see that the markets are relatively unchanged and, and haven't necessarily responded to this as negatively. I think that has to do more with the fact that the digital asset market has largely priced in a lot of the monetary policy, fears and uncertainty in terminal rates and we probably would have saw much more of a movement upwards. Um Given where data came in. Do you think we're going to see? Um another rate hike? I do think that the guidance from terminal rates in the range of, you know, 500 to 600 basis points will stay where it is. And I think the bigger fear of what we saw today is there's still more work to do. Um these are not data points that suggests by any means that we are at the point in time where both the current environment um in terms of interest rates as well as the duration in which rates have been hiked has been enough to bring costs down. Um Economics are starting to caution that housing costs are unlikely to help drop dramatically moving forward. You see certain depressed prices in areas. Um but those aren't necessarily expected to keep dropping if you look at things like medical care or airline fares or things like that. So, while future pricing, you know, may suggest that we won't necessarily see a raise in interest rates. It isn't necessarily suggesting the converse might be true in which we would see maybe a cut in rates either. And I think that's what the market is actually more so ascertaining right now. All right, let's transition back to the crypto markets and talk about matrix ports, Bitcoin, greed and Fear Index. It's suggesting that there could be a bull revival in Bitcoin. Uh What's your short term outlook on Bitcoin? What might we see it do? Uh leading up? Well, in the second half of the year, there's really three large catalysts that we're mindful to as it pertains to the Bitcoin price, as well as the broader digital asset pricing in the market, first and foremost monetary policy, which we just touched on. Um Second to that really has to do with some of the broader global currency risk and fears hyper inflation continuing to spiral out of control some of the de dollarization that we saw over the last several months and earlier this year with the banking debacle that's really played a significant role and revitalizing this sort of thesis around Bitcoin and certain digital assets behaving more like a safe haven commodity and overall idiosyncratic asset to acquire that doesn't necessarily have those same features as monetary policy based currencies around the world. The third is really on a regulator side obviously a bill that's going through Congress right now, that really sets the stage to eliminate what we've seen as enforcement centric regulation by certain legislators in the US. And moving more towards having clear cut guidelines that will pave the way for both institutional adoption, retail adoption, day to day consumption and activity of digital assets, as well as really propelling some of the innovation into the markets. We're starting to see big players, you know, Schwab Black Rock, you name it that are starting to really jump into the space with some of that clear guideline that's been established. Yes. Speaking of catalysts and hype matrix report also predicts that the SEC is going to approve several spot. Bitcoin ETF s, what's your take on on the hype around these? Do you think we're going to see several approvals before the end of the year? You know, it's, it's always tough to really rationalize how much of certain of this activity is, is adequately priced into the market and what the incremental impact would be, you know, in terms of pricing in the news versus the actual reality of things. I think generally speaking, setting up for spot based assets and derivatives versus ones in the past that were purely cash settled is extremely important just in terms of the overall demand and really sets the stage for global adoption of Bitcoin at scale to the extent that we're already seeing in certain emerging economies and established economies across the world, whether it's Argentina or Turkey. And really quickly, I want to get your thoughts here on alt coins. Uh We had a report on coin desk that says a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern is forming. What do you, what do you think about alt coins? Do you think we're gonna see them break out? I don't necessarily always, you know, suggest that um users trade off of pure technical patterns particularly in a market that has only been around for a decade. And how many, you know, technical patterns are we able to really leverage and, and that sort of analysis and speculation, I would say from the al coin perspective, overall, there are a ton of fundamentals. Um And I think that what we've seen is, you know, the baby has really gotten thrown out with the bath water over the last couple of years and it's led to a lot of suppression and pricing. Um And I do think that there are certain coins out there that will really be fundamental players in the broader web, three ecosystem over the next few years that do have some intrinsic value behind them. Um So, you know, I wouldn't necessarily be surprised if the market, especially as those catalysts that we talked about, start to really play out, starts to really reprice certain of these assets. And, you know, of course, you'll see overall systematic movement in the market. Um But I do think certain key players will really be large beneficiaries of that. All right, Anthony, we're gonna have to leave it there. Thanks for joining the show and I hope you have a great weekend. You as well. Thank you. That was innovating capital, general partner, Anthony Georgia."

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped on Thursday morning in Asia after briefly breaching the US$30,000 resistance level. Ether also dipped, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Cardano\u2019s ADA token led the winners. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index moved higher. However, trading volume dropped after a surge earlier in the week. U.S. stock futures logged losses Wednesday but were trading higher on Thursday morning in Asia. Investors now await key U.S. inflation data with an eye on how that will affect the Fed\u2019s decision making on interest rates.\n\nBitcoin dips but set for bullish trend\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.72% in the last 24 hours to US$29,592.49 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but rose 1.59% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$30,093.44 on Wednesday evening, but struggled to stay above the US$30,000 threshold.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin prices remain range bound, the token is set for a bullish trend, said Samer Hasn, market analyst at Australia-based global multi-asset broker XS.com.\n\n\u201cWe witnessed the number of open interest positions (in Bitcoin) rise to the highest level since October of 2022 with more than 10.4 billion positions on August 8,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nHe added that a high number of open interests, which includes long and short positions, generally precedes a rise in momentum and increased volatility.\n\n\u201cThe increase in the number of open positions reflects more positive sentiment among investors with more recognition,\u201d Hasn said, adding that the new offering of the PYUSD stablecoin from PayPal \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest payment companies \u2014 will increase access to cryptocurrency networks.\n\nSimilarly, spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund applications from major investment firms like BlackRock and Wisdom Tree will, if approved by U.S. regulators, provide \u201cmore access by individual investors, institutional investors, and large companies that may not be able to invest in cryptocurrencies directly,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dipped 0.21% to US$1,856.01 but held a weekly gain of 0.94%. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Cardano\u2019s ADA leading the winners, while Binance\u2019s BNB, Tron\u2019s TRX and Litecoin logged losses.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA rose 1.03% to US$0.3016 for a weekly gain of 0.75% after the Cardano mainnet launched the Bitcoin token cBTC on Wednesday. The launch will allow Bitcoin holders to tokenize their Bitcoin on the Cardano network as cBTC and use it in Cardano\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nBitcoin, meet Cardano.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce mainnet is now LIVE \ud83d\udc7c\n\n\n\nMainnet below \u26c5\ufe0f\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/j6vHNUKIlL pic.twitter.com/Li81Pr8fpn \u2014 anetaBTC \ud83d\udc7c Mainnet Live (@anetaBTC) August 8, 2023\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.31% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume remained flat, inching down 1.11% to US$35.54 billion.\n\nThe future is now for gaming NFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.71% in the past 24 hours to 2,493.11 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, and notched a 0.10% gain for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Solana NFT indexes also logged gains, while the indexes for Polygon and Cardano dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 16.72% in the past 24 hours to over US$16.31 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all also logged losses.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Polygon-based DraftKings saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, but fell 65.56% to US$1.43 million. Still, those sales accounted for over 50% of the total NFT trading volume on the Polygon network. The collection is based on sports and betting company DraftKings\u2019 NFT games.\n\n\u201cDraftKings did huge numbers, at one point reflecting over US$4.6 million on CryptoSlam\u2019s collection rankings,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cThese are being driven by fantasy football packs in the Reignmakers series. Packs range from US$20 to US$9,999, and some with supplies of over 50k packs. You can see how with brands like DraftKings and the National Football League (NFL), and prices like that, how they can rack up millions of dollars in sales in a day.\u201d\n\nAccording to Petscher, winter in the market can be a blessing for NFTs used in play-to-earn games.\n\n\u201cThis bear market is sorta like the Great Reset for NFTs,\u201d said Petscher in a Wednesday tweet. \u201cWithout it traders would still be conditioned for unrealistic gains. Now they\u2019ll be happy for a few dollars here, maybe 20 bucks there, and then some home runs every so often. Expect to see more numbers like DraftKings, DMarket Gods Unchained and Sorare.\u201d\n\nIn CryptoSlams\u2019 NFT collection ranking, DraftKings, Mythos Chain-based DMarket, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained and Ethereum-based Sorare took up the top 5 spots by seven-day sales volume.\n\n\u201cMythos Chain, Polygon, ImmutableX, and Ethereum are all represented in CryptoSlam\u2019s Top Five Collections so far this week, and show the multi-chain future that\u2019s not just ahead of us. It\u2019s here,\u201d tweeted Petscher on Thursday.\n\nElsewhere, Canadian musician and producer Claire Elise Boucher, known professionally as Grimes, said in an interview with U.S. magazine Wired that she has earned more money from NFTs than from her music career. Boucher sold around US$6 million worth of NFTs in an auction in early 2021.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad about what happened to NFTs and crypto, because it got polluted fast with people trying to make as much money as possible,\u201d said Boucher in the interview.\n\n\u201cBut I do want to think about compensating artists, especially digital artists. And I hope when the aggro niche dies down, we can come back,\u201d she said.\n\n(Updates with NFT section.)\n\nU.S. equity futures up ahead of key inflation data\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the stock market closed lower on Wednesday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were mixed on Wednesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi logged losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved up.\n\nInvestors are now waiting for the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) in July, which is set for release on Thursday. Analysts expect the annual inflation rate to hit 3.3% in July, up from 3.0% in June, with the monthly rate remaining unchanged at 0.2%.\n\nHowever, an acceleration in the annual inflation rate would not necessarily equate to a reverse of the recent inflation slowdown.\n\nTalking to The Wall Street Journal, Laura Rosner, founding partner at advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives, pointed to this time last year when inflation peaked in June and then slowed down in the following month.\n\nA monthly inflation rate of 0.2% in June would be consistent with the moderate inflation that the Federal Reserve wants to see, Rosner said.\n\nMeanwhile, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said on Tuesday the Fed might be ready to pause interest rate hikes.\n\n\u201cAbsent any alarming new data between now and mid-September, I believe we may be at the point where we can be patient and hold rates steady and let the monetary policy actions we have taken do their work,\u201d said Harker.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 87.0% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, up from 86.5% on Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday to regulate U.S. investment in Chinese entities engaged in three sectors: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, the sectors listed in the order were narrower than expected, which some analysts interpret as a sign that Biden\u2019s administration is seeking to improve relations with China.\n\n\u201cFor the business community, this is relatively good news,\u201d Sarah Bauerle Danzman, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and associate professor of international studies at Indiana University, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively narrow notification process and a very narrow set of prohibitions.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) delay in deciding whether to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States is fueling expectations that a final verdict will come in a batch that includes key players on Wall Street, including BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of pressure on the SEC to approve a number of these ETFs, particularly because the approved Futures backed products are lagging spot performance substantially, harming investors,\u201d markets veteran and co-founder of CoinRoutes Dave Weisberger told Cointelegraph, adding that all pending applications will likely be included in a final decision.\n\nThe SEC is analyzing a total of eight applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF, following past delays and denials of the crypto product in recent years. Companies up for a decision are ARK Invest and 21Shares, Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco and Galaxy Digital, Fidelity, and Valkyrie. Together, the firms manage over $15 trillion in global assets.\n\nOn Aug. 11, the U.S. markets regulator opened a 21-day comment period for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. As per the filing, the SEC is seeking answers on whether ARK 21Shares\u2019 proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, as well as whether the Bitcoin (BTC) market is susceptible to manipulation.\n\nFurthermore, the regulator raised concerns about Coinbase\u2019s surveillance-sharing agreement, asking commenters to examine whether Coinbase\u2019s participation in the ETF's surveillance would, in fact, help to detect, investigate and deter fraud and manipulation in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s main concern about spot crypto ETFs is about the potential market manipulation by a big whale. Theoretically, it can happen if the SEC approves the ETFs of one or two investment funds. But if it decides to register all 8 ETFs, it will sharply mitigate the probability of manipulation, because these firms will be able to trade with each other frequently, taking opposite sides,\" explained Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler.\n\nSEC application timeline for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence/James Seyffart\n\nThe delay had a lesser impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price, hovering around the $30,000 mark at the time of writing. According to Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of crypto lending platform Ledn, traders and investors are \u201cexpecting [the SEC] to take all the time they could,\" with today\u2019s decision having a low impact \u201cin terms of market expectations.\"\n\nThe SEC still has two deadlines before a final decision is made. The third deadline for the ARK 21Shares application is due by January 2024. Valkyrie has the latest application in line, with two upcoming deadlines in January and March next year.\n\nThe BTC ETF outcome could reshape the crypto investment landscape. According to Lienkha, an approval could potentially bring over $70 billion in liquidity to the Bitcoin market. \u201cThe opportunity to invest in Bitcoin through ETFs will give regular investors more confidence, as with professional help, they don\u2019t have to dive into all the technical details and analyze potential risks by themselves,\" he noted.\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

A number of firms also amended existing applications to include cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing partner following reports SEC officials could be more open to accepting a spot crypto ETF under those conditions.\n\nAs of Aug. 11, the SEC has not approved any spot crypto ETF application for listing shares in the U.S. but started allowing investment vehicles linked to BTC futures in October 2021.

        "content": "A newly discovered vulnerability in the Libbitcoin Explorer 3.x library has allowed over $900,000 to be stolen from Bitcoin users, according to a report from blockchain security firm SlowMist. The vulnerability can also affect users of Ethereum, Ripple, Dogecoin, Solana, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Zcash who use Libbitcoin to generate accounts.\n\nSlowMist Security Alert\n\n\n\nRecently, #Distrust discovered a severe vulnerability affecting cryptocurrency wallets using the #Libbitcoin Explorer 3.x versions. This vulnerability allows attackers to access wallet private keys by exploiting the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random\u2026 \u2014 SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) August 10, 2023\n\nLibbitcoin is a Bitcoin wallet implementation that developers and validators sometimes use to create Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrency accounts. According to its official website, it is used by \u201cAirbitz (mobile wallet), Bitprim (developer interface), Blockchain Commons (decentralized wallet identity), Cancoin (decentralized exchange)\u201d and other applications. SlowMist did not specify which applications that use Libbitcoin, if any, are affected by the vulnerability.\n\nSlowMist identified cybersecurity team \u201cDistrust\" as the team that originally discovered the loophole, which is called the \u201cMilk Sad\u201d vulnerability. It was reported to the CEV cybersecurity vulnerability database on Aug. 7.\n\nAccording to the post, the Libbitcoin Explorer has a faulty key generation mechanism, allowing private keys to be guessed by attackers. As a result, attackers exploited this vulnerability to steal over $900,000 worth of crypto as of Aug. 10.\n\nSlowMist emphasized that one attack in particular siphoned away over 9.7441 BTC (approximately $278,318). The firm claims to have \u201cblocked\u201d the address, implying that the team has contacted exchanges to prevent the attacker from cashing out the funds. The team also stated that it will be monitoring the address in case funds are moved elsewhere.\n\nFour members of the Distrust team, along with eight freelance security consultants who claim to have helped discover the vulnerability, have set up an informational website explaining the vulnerability. They explained that the loophole is created when users employ the \u201cbx seed\u201d command to generate a wallet seed. This command \u201cuses the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) initialized with 32 bits of system time,\u201d which lacks sufficient randomness and therefore sometimes produces the same seed for multiple persons.\n\nBx seed command producing the same seed twice. Source: Milk Sad information site\n\nThe researchers claim to have discovered the vulnerability when they were contacted by a Libbitcoin user whose BTC had mysteriously gone missing on July 21. When the user reached out to other Libbitcoin users to try to determine how the BTC could have gone missing, the person found that other users were also having their BTC siphoned away.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to Libbitcoin Institute member Eric Voskuil for comment. In response, Voskuil stated that the bx seed command \"is provided as a convenience for when the tool is used to demonstrate behavior that requires entropy\" and is not intended to be used in production wallets. \"If people did in fact use it for production key seeding (as opposed to rolling dice for example) then the warning is insufficient,\" Voskuil stated. In that case, \"We'll likely make some change within the next few days to strengthen the warning against production use, or remove the command altogether.\"\n\nWallet vulnerabilities continue to pose a problem for crypto users in 2023. Over $100 million was lost in a hack of the Atomic Wallet in June, which was acknowledged by the app\u2019s team on June 22. Cybersecurity certification platform CER released its wallet security rankings in July, noting that only six out of 45 wallet brands employ penetration testing to discover vulnerabilities.\n\nUpdate (Aug. 10 20:51 UTC): This article has been updated to include a comment from Eric Voskuil."

        "content": "New us. Inflation data is out. The consumer price index rose 0.2% in July on a seasonally adjusted basis. Joining us now to discuss how the crypto markets are reacting is path trading partners, co-founder and Chief Market strategist Bob Aino. Welcome back to the show, Bob. Good morning. Good to see you, Jesse just made me smile. He's like in such a good mood all the time. I love that. I know he just brings the energy first thing in the morning and Bob every time I get to say your last name, I smile, it just rolls off the tongue. A Chino cappuccino. So as long as you like, I love cappuccinos. All right, this is not a show about coffee. Let's talk about the markets. Uh Bitcoin is not moving, Bob, it's not moving. We're hovering around 29,500. Uh What's your reaction to what's going on in the markets right now? Well, I mean, I'm pretty positive and unfortunately, uh you know, one of the things I think that sparked this recent rally in Bitcoin was Larry think of black rock kind of blessing Bitcoin as something that's actually going to be here long enough to create an ETF. Um I, I think it's interesting that after that we just kind of solve these levels because I've, I've been both positive and negative short to medium term and honestly, I couldn't be more positive the asset right now just looking at what's happening, looking at what's happening in the broader economy. I've said this on your show before, Jen, that I think the two things for me are gold and Bitcoin right now. Gold. Simply because, you know, as an old finance guy myself, it's definitely easier to convert to fiat when I need to. Uh Bitcoin has little longer term play for me. It's, it was a long time before I decided that Bitcoin wasn't my space and once I made that decision, um it's stuck with me and it's just kind of the, the longer term investment, I don't see any way around it. The more people from the old economy that we have on our podcast that we record every week, the more I believe Bitcoin is here to stay. So, um, you know, it's funny because, you know, you're bullish and a lot of people are bullish, but it, there is kind of a wintry gust still, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't totally feel like crypto is, is, is back completely right. And, and I guess my question would be like, what, aside from, you know, one of these ETF S being approved would sort of be the, the thing that sort of pushes the needle in your opinion. Well, I think when Jesse was talking about, you know, getting more people to just give it a try that, that resonated with me. It's actually something I talked about in another interview, uh, about 10 days ago where you still have people that just say, I don't understand it and the effort to understand it just isn't there and getting people to either a realize that at least to get involved, you don't need to understand Blockchain and, and NFTS in the entire world of, of D I, you just have to understand that it's decentralized and that essentially it's the answer to the questions that most of us in the old finance world are asking, you know, again, as long as it's not regulated out of existence, which that's the part of the Black Rock thing. I mean, I, I'm not a fan of Black Rock as a company at all, but the fact that they want to make an ETF, you can look at them as sort of the evil empire and say they'll make money off of anything they can. But they're also not going to invest in something that isn't going to be here for the long term for them to make money, which is what they're actually doing right now. So the second part of that, uh, Emily is that you, you have to actually bring people across and get this world, the world that you guys exist on a daily basis to simplify some of these things. You know, listening to Jesse talk, I realized that there's about 80% of the terms that I don't even know what they are. And I'm an older owner and a holder of Bitcoin myself. So it's a more complex world than people like me know, but it's also a simpler world than the people that I can't seem to drag in. Keep kicking and screaming to learn the basics of it is all right, Bob. And lastly, we mentioned that CP I index in our intro here. What's your reaction to the latest us inflation data? And how might that relate to how we see the crypto markets move? So I'm sort of an inflation evangelist and what I mean by that is trying to get people to understand why when an economy is actually strong in the data, why they still feel so bad about the data? And one of the things I looked at about a week ago was the employment cost index, right? Which is basically what we all get paid all in, right? What it costs businesses to pay us. And that's up since about the first quarter of 2020 is up, about 14% inflation is up about 18%. So it's that gap that makes people feel like the economy is still bad. You know, we were talking about coffee earlier. I had a really knowledgeable friend of mine call me and say, can you show me a coffee chart because I don't understand why my Starbucks is still a dollar more than it was later or it was last year because all I keep hearing about is inflation coming down. Inflation is the rate of growth of prices. And we still had a positive number this month. Even though it was lower than it was in previous months, you go back to last August month, over month, it was up 0.3 this month, it was up 0.4. So prices are still going up, but they're going up at a much, much slower rate. And that means that the catch up is coming. And that's why you still, you see strikes, right? You see people complaining about the wages they're getting. That's because they haven't caught up to inflation yet. So as long as that remains in check and we still have this push for higher wages, people will actually get to the point on main street where they feel better about the economy overall. All right, Bob, we are gonna have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining the show. Always a pleasure having you on. Good to see you guys.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once again postponed its verdict on the spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) put forward by ARK Investment Management.\n\nThe SEC on Aug. 11 initiated a 21-day public comment window for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, marking another delay in the regulator's decision-making process concerning the approval of a spot crypto ETF in the U.S.\n\nARK's initial application to list the ETF was submitted in May, granting the SEC up to 240 days, or until January 2024, to finalize its stance.\n\nTo achieve a listing on the Cboe BZX Exchange, which is ARK Investment Management's target, an applicant must demonstrate the existence of a \"robust surveillance-sharing agreement with a sizable regulated market.\"\n\nThe SEC has previously turned down the company's crypto ETF submissions, asserting that it lacked adequate measures to \"thwart deceptive and manipulative activities\" and ensure investor safety.\n\nIn its statement, the SEC clarified, \"The test for a regulated market of significant size doesn't mandate the spot Bitcoin market's regulation for the Commission's approval.\n\nAlso Read: Binance Labs Invests $5M In Curve DAO Token To Propel DeFi Growth\n\nHistorically, the underlying market for a spot commodity or currency being regulated has typically been an outlier.\n\nARK Investment Management is among several U.S. entities trying to have a spot crypto ETF listed on an official exchange.\n\nNotably, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's premier asset management entity, submitted its proposal in July.\n\nSeveral companies have also revised their applications to incorporate cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) as a surveillance-sharing ally, following indications that SEC representatives might be more receptive to a spot crypto ETF under such terms.\n\nAs of the Aug. 11 update, the SEC hasn't greenlit any spot crypto ETF listing proposals in the U.S., though since October 2021, it has permitted investment structures associated with BTC futures.\n\nPresently, Grayscale is embroiled in a legal dispute with the SEC due to the latter's denial to list Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust as a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nRead Next: BIS, Ripple Team Up To Make Cross-Border Payments Faster And Cheaper\n\nJoin Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets in New York City on Nov. 14, 2023, to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions and institutional adoption in the crypto space.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin spot volume is the lowest since 2021\n\nNVTS signals an extremely overvalued zone\n\nChart analysis indicates the start of a downtrend\n\nTwo scenarios ahead\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has declined from its July 13 spike of $31,800, falling to $28,477 at its lowest point today, August 1 which is a decrease of 10.65%.\n\nWith its volume sitting at its lowest since late 2020 \u2013 early 2021, and its price struggling to maintain an uptrend are we in for the start of a major downtrend?\n\nBitcoin Fundamental Analysis\n\nAs per Messari data , the Real Volume, which attempts to deduct an estimated \u201cwash trading\u201d volume from the exchange reported volume, we actually haven\u2019t seen these low levels since February 2019.\n\nWith low volume the trading price becomes uncertain or in other words, it is questionable. If the volume is high that means that more investors are participating in the assets value determination consensus \u2013 the price. And, with it being in an uptrend, it could prove to be based on weak hands.\n\nFrom July 17, we have seen an increase in Bitcoin held in exchange reserves per Cryptoquant . Although compared to the longevity of the previous downtrend, this isn\u2019t a significant rise, it could prove to be an early indication that the coin holders are starting to deposit BTC to sell.\n\nAccording to Woobull Network Valut to Transactions Signal (NVTS), we could have reached the overvalued zone.\n\nThis metric is calculated as Network Value / 90d MA of Daily Transaction Value and serves as the market top and bottom signal. Its value reached the highest level of 2.23, last seen in November 2013 when the second-ever Bitcoin bear market started.\n\nCompared to the usual high level with the price chart, we can clearly see that this metric has provided an indication of market tops and proved to foresee price drops.\n\nDoes this extreme value mean the next price drop will be even more dramatic?\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin reached the ending point of an uptrend that started on November 21, 2022, two different scenarios can play out moving forward.\n\nBullish Scenario\n\nSince the November 21, 2022 low of $15,457 was a lower low compared to the June 18 same year, this would be the only point from which we can count the start of the bull cycle.\n\nNovember 21, 2022, low market, the completion of the previous downtrend from November 9, 2021, counted as a five-wave impulse of the lower degree, and the C wave from the ABC correction that started on April 13, 2021, when the price of Bitcoin was $64,227.\n\nAccording to this count, we have now seen the completion of the first bull market wave and are now waiting for the same degree correction for wave 2. Typically, wave 2 ends around the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level of wave 1, which now comes at the target of $20,340. Wave 2 can, in theory, retrace the price by 100% and still be valid, so a deeper price target could be seen.\n\nAfter the completion of this retracement which would establish the first higher low, we can potentially see the start of wave 3 and the price of Bitcoin headed into another multi-year bull cycle.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nIn the bearish scenario, the waves are counted a bit differently, namely in the degrees and sub-degrees.\n\nIn contrast to the bullish count where the rise from November 21, 2022, is a first five-wave impulse, in a bearish scenario, it still is a five-wave impulse but of a lower degree count, which in conjunction with the recovery we have seen from June 18 \u2013 August 14 the same year, makes an ABC correction.\n\nThis ABC correction is wave 4 of the higher degree count from the five-wave impulse that started on November 9, 2021, when the price of Bitcoin reached its peak of $68,715. If this scenario is in play that would mean that the price is now headed for the starting wave 5 which is set to make a lower low compared to June 18 last year.\n\nSince the most significant support zone to the downside is around $11,000 that would be the projected target for the end of the bear market.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith low volatility, weak fundamentals, and the price chart pointing out the completion of its 232 days uptrend (November 21, 2022 \u2013 July 13, 2023), we are now going to see the start of the large descending move.\n\nAccording to the bullish count, the price of Bitcoin could fall to the $20,300 area, while in a bearish one, it could see a further low of even $11,000. It is still early to say which one is more likely, but since in the mid-term, we are expecting the move in the same direction, from its momentum and character we are going to evaluate these possibilities.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in history this indicator appeared\n\nMore validating will come shortly\n\nThe price target of $135,461 could be modest.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been moving sideways since July 24, when it fell from $30,292 to $28,900. However, we saw a significant upward price spike of 4.3% on August 1, but it quickly came back inside of its sideways range.\n\nThere is now a rare indicator flashing a bull signal, it could be an early indication that a move to the upside would be expected.\n\nGolden Cross\n\nThe golden cross is not a rare indicator of itself. It is a common indicator that means that the faster (lower length) moving average is crossing, the slower (higher length) moving average from the upside. This indicates that the price has started to trend upward. If the opposite happens, it is called a death cross, which indicates the starting downtrend. Higher length values and broader time frames bring more validity to the cross strategy.\n\nOn the weekly chart above, we can see that the golden cross is starting to show. The 20-day moving average is going above the 200-day moving average, which has never occurred in this fashion.\n\nIn the history of Bitcoin, we have only seen two occasions when a similar indication was made, and they were both around bear market bottoms \u2013 September 28, 2015, and April 1, 2019. In September 2015, we saw the 20 SMA going briefly below 200 SMA and then back above it, while in April 2019, an interaction was made but not the cross.\n\nFor this third time, the 20 SMA went below the 200 SMA in September 2020, and stayed there for 336 days before now making it back above.\n\nCan this signal the starting bull market with the price of Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs?\n\nPrice prediction\n\nDrawing a curved channel in which the price of Bitcoin has been trading since the beginning of price history, we can see that all of the highs and lows are perfectly respected. Out of those, the June 18, 2022, low was yet another retest of the channel\u2019s support.\n\n\n\nAs a bounce was made from the support level and the price recovered by 110%, there is a strong possibility that we have seen the start of a bull cycle from there. If this is the case, and based on the golden cross chart, the price of Bitcoin could be headed toward a new all-time high.\n\nIt is still very early to discuss these targets, but the curved channel we have drawn gives us a target of $135,461.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOn June 18 last year, we saw the price of Bitcoin falling to $15,240 at its lowest point. In Bitcoin\u2019s history, the bear market bottoms were usually higher than their previous bull market tops.\n\n\n\nThis cycle was the first time in the history of Bitcoin that the price fell below the previous bull cycle top, which correlates with what we have seen on the Golden Cross chart \u2013 the 20 SMA moving 336 days below the 200 SMA for the first time in history. You can see by the white rectangle\u2019s that this distance is getting shorter with each cycle and has now gotten negative in this one.\n\nIt could have meant that the price of Bitcoin below $20,000 was extremely undervalued. With only the first wave seen \u2013 from June 18, 2022, until now, it is still not clear whether or not the price is in a bull cycle or in the mid-bear market correction.\n\nAnother low to $11,000 is still on the table, so a stronger confirmation will be received on the next descending move. Namely, we need to see the first higher low compared to June 18, 2022.\n\nBut if we are in a starting bull cycle, the $135,461 could be a modest one with only 320% more to go, measured to the current level of $29,200.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "After June gave Bitcoin (BTC) a boost with BlackRock\u2019s application for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), July sent its price into a summer slump. Only some altcoins managed to perform well in response to Ripple Labs\u2019 partial victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. XRP (XRP), the most obvious beneficiary, posted a monthly close of +49%.\n\nThe overall response of markets to the result of the lawsuit was much more muted than many anticipated, as a ruling on XRP\u2019s sales does not easily generalize to other coins and tokens. The SEC is now firmly expected to appeal, and market activity has been generally waning over the summer months.\n\nExploring how the various sectors of the digital asset space have performed in this environment, Cointelegraph Research\u2019s \u201cInvestor Insights Report\u201d offers a concise monthly round-up of everything going on in crypto. It dives into venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulation, mining and much more.\n\nThe report is available for free on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nNFTs and DeFi take a hit\n\nNonfungible tokens (NFTs) have suffered throughout the bear market. However, in July, interest in NFTs waned so much that even classic collections fell to price levels as low as before the craze of 2021. The floor price of Bored Ape Yacht Club fell below 30 Ether (ETH), and the top five NFT collections in terms of lifetime earnings collected only $800,000 in monthly royalties.\n\nThe weak numbers were accompanied by negative news surrounding Azuki, a well-known blue-chip NFT project. The AzukiDAO filed a proposal to sue Azuki\u2019s founder and win back 20,000 ETH lost to alleged rug pulls.\n\nThe DeFi sector has been plagued by similar woes, with an unprecedented security vulnerability discovered and exploited. Vulnerabilities in DeFi typically stem from poorly implemented smart contracts, but this time, the Vyper programming language \u2014 an alternative to Solidity \u2014 was subject to a vulnerability that resulted in Curve Finance being exploited for over $61 million in a reentrancy hack.\n\nWith the Curve liquidity pools compromised, the price of CRV crashed. The exploited funds were returned several days later, with the hacker accepting a 10% bounty. These and other developments, such as recent news surrounding ZK-rollups, can be found in the DeFi section of Cointelegraph Research\u2019s monthly trends report.\n\nCrypto stocks retain strength\n\nCrypto stocks have shown unusual strength in recent months, most notably the top mining stocks, which have consistently outperformed BTC. The Cointelegraph Research Investor Insights Report has been tracking the performance of these stocks since their rally started earlier this year.\n\nIn July, too, the market prices for tokens and coins lagged behind the performance of crypto stocks. Publicly traded crypto companies gained an average of 23.9% in their stock price by month-end. Coinbase shares skyrocketed in mid-July in response to the outcome of the Ripple lawsuit and stayed above $100 per share for a week, closing out the month at +32.19%.\n\nMicroStrategy posted a similarly bullish monthly close at +27.25%. However, mining companies once again stood out as the top performers, with Stronghold Digital Mining shares increasing almost 75% while TeraWulf and Riot Platforms saw gains of over 50% from their early July levels.\n\nThe Cointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry. Bringing together academic rigor and filtered through practical, hard-won experience, the researchers on the team are committed to bringing the most accurate, insightful content available on the market.\n\nWith decades of combined experience in traditional finance, business, engineering, technology and research, the Cointelegraph Research team is perfectly positioned to put its combined talents to proper use with the latest Investor Insights Report.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are for general informational purposes only and are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations for any individual or on any specific security or investment product."

        "title": "How to Invest in Cryptocurrency | Investing | U.S. News - U.S News & World Report Money",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have enjoyed a strong resurgence in 2023. Bitcoin (BTC) is up by about 78% as of Aug. 10, and Ethereum (ETH) has rewarded investors with a year-to-date gain of about 55%. Renewed interest in the alternative asset and institutional investors pouring into crypto have contributed to the rally.\n\nBitcoin grabbed the spotlight in 2017 when the coin surged by roughly 2,000% in one year. Bitcoin, like other cryptocurrencies, has always been more volatile than most assets. However, the general trend has been upward. Bitcoin gains have exceeded 376% over the five years preceding Aug. 10, and Ethereum has done even better, with a 454% gain.\n\n\n\nThose types of long-term returns tend to attract investors who want to maximize their profits. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have outperformed so-called FAANG stocks (Amazon.com Inc. (ticker: AMZN), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other tech leaders) over the past five years, but there's more to crypto than Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nInvestors can choose from thousands of altcoins to diversify their crypto portfolios. Cardano (ADA), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are some of the top altcoins by market cap.\n\nCryptocurrencies can continue to rally and generate long-term gains as more businesses use blockchain technology and institutional investors accumulate crypto. Here's what you need to know about how to invest in cryptocurrency:\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital asset that operates on a blockchain. This blockchain is a peer-to-peer medium of exchange without a central authority. Pavel Matveev, CEO and co-founder of Wirex, says the decentralized nature of crypto gives it several advantages over fiat currencies.\n\n\"By eliminating the reliance on a central authority and operating through a network of distributed nodes, blockchain started a new era of security and transparency,\" Matveev says. \"This design makes it more resilient against cyberattacks, system crashes and human errors compared to centralized systems.\"\n\nCrypto transactions get recorded in a public blockchain. A digital asset like Bitcoin can act as a storage of value, similar to gold. The Ethereum blockchain allows smart contracts to execute secure financial transactions. But any cryptocurrency's value depends on how others perceive the asset. If more businesses enable crypto payments, the alternative asset can see more use for its intended purpose. At the moment, many investors have been accumulating crypto because of how it has rewarded long-term investors over the past few years.\n\nCrypto Exchanges and Crypto Wallets\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum's coin Ether are the two most popular cryptocurrencies, but investors can choose from thousands of cryptos. Deviating away from the two top cryptos can increase your potential returns but can also significantly increase your risk.\n\nSome cryptocurrencies ride a short-term wave of momentum before fading off into the sunset. A crypto investment can become worthless, but this fate is less likely for cryptocurrencies with large market caps.\n\nBeginner investors may benefit from using a crypto exchange to facilitate their transactions. Some brokerage firms, such as Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) and Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), let you buy crypto without creating your own wallet. These firms store crypto for you, but you still get to harvest long-term gains.\n\nAs you get more comfortable with crypto, setting up a crypto wallet can give you true ownership of your assets without relying on a centralized entity. Just make sure you keep your private key somewhere you can easily find it. That private key is your crypto wallet's password, and you cannot get a new passcode or access the wallet if you forget your private key.\n\nRegardless of how investors trade crypto, they should watch out for fees and spreads. Looking at crypto transaction fees can help you gauge which brokerage firms offer better deals. Lowering your transaction fees will protect more of your capital, which can then go into new investments.\n\n\n\nRisks of Investing in Cryptocurrency\n\nEvery investment has risks, and crypto is no exception to the rule. The asset is speculative and has produced millionaires, but getting in at the wrong time can lead to significant losses.\n\nBitcoin has performed well year to date and over the past five years. However, the cryptocurrency has fallen 57% from its all-time high of $68,789.63. The big drop, compared with strong year-to-date gains, highlights how unstable these assets can be. Jatali Bellanton, CEO of BMU Meta crypto hedge fund, encourages investors to look at the big picture instead of at the sharp volatility.\n\n\"Even though people discuss its volatility, the returns are high for the right pick. Imagine if a company is up by 300%, and then it drops by 50%,\" she says. \"In the end, it is still up 100%. Be sure to bank some profits and not get too greedy.\"\n\nRegulation has always been a central focus for the crypto investment thesis. While many countries have lightened up on the adoption of cryptocurrencies, other countries are still placing restrictions on cryptocurrencies or banning them outright.\n\nYou should do your due diligence before committing to a crypto brokerage, and even then, a crypto wallet may be the better choice. Investors who put their crypto into FTX saw their assets evaporate and become inaccessible after founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested on charges that he mismanaged funds and defrauded investors. The FTX fiasco demonstrates the worst of what can happen to crypto investors. Keeping your coins in a crypto wallet reduces this concern, since you own your crypto and can access it at any time.\n\nIt may take a while for cryptocurrencies to fulfill their original mission as units of exchange. More businesses would have to enable crypto as a payment method, and even then, investors may be more inclined to hold onto an asset that has outpaced the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 over the past five years.\n\nHow to Make Money with Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrencies offer several paths to monetization for investors. You can buy cryptocurrencies and hold them over the long run, hoping these assets will gain in value. Investors can also trade crypto and capitalize on price fluctuations.\n\nSome traders monitor price fluctuations throughout the day, while others set \"good 'til canceled\" orders to have trades executed once crypto reaches the set limit price. These types of orders minimize the amount of time traders spend in their portfolios and looking at crypto price charts.\n\nCrypto staking is another way to earn money with \"proof of stake\" cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Cardano. It's similar to lending crypto to other investors that you can reclaim at any time. Staking allows crypto investors to participate in the validation of transactions on the blockchain.\n\nMatveev explains how crypto staking is similar to collecting dividends from your favorite stocks: \"Crypto staking refers to the process of earning passive income by holding coins in a wallet. This concept bears some resemblance to a traditional bank deposit, though the crucial distinction lies in the utilization of the deposited funds. Rather than being used for investments and loans, staking employs these funds to facilitate the smooth functioning of the underlying blockchain network.\"\n\nThe yield you earn from crypto staking depends on the type of crypto you use. Less risky cryptocurrencies like Ethereum command lower yields, while you can earn more cash flow with altcoins like Cardano, Solana and Dogecoin. Crypto staking can generate 5% to 10% yields for some tokens.\n\nTakeaway"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nXverse, a Bitcoin wallet designed to work with projects native to the coin, announced on Thursday a seed funding round of $5 million led by Jump Crypto.\n\nOther participants in the round included Franklin Templeton, the Bitcoin Frontier Fund, Old Fashion Research, and several strategic angel investors, Xverse told Decrypt in a written statement.\n\nXverse\u2019s wallet, which is available as a Chrome browser extension and mobile app, is billed as a \u201cBitcoin wallet for Web3.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt works with networks that push crypto\u2019s largest coin beyond a pure focus on financial transactions like Ordinals, Lighting Network, and Stacks.\n\nThe company sees Bitcoin as a growing frontier for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, which have become established staples of Ethereum over the past few years.\n\nThe funding will help Xverse pursue more advanced features in emerging areas, company founder and CEO Ken Liao told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWe want to power all kinds of web applications built on top of Bitcoin, whether that\u2019s through Ordinals or Layer-2s like Stacks and Lightning,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we see something that's promising and can bring a lot of utility, we are into supporting that as well.\u201d\n\nOrdinals, a protocol that allows for the creation of NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by attaching data to individual satoshi (equal to 1/1,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin), has been a boon to Xverse, Liao said. It gave the firm a shot in the arm and room to grow, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe firm established itself as an early mover in the Ordinals space, rolling out support for inscriptions this past February\u2014a month after Ordinals launched. As of late, Xverse has given users a way to store Ordinals-based assets on Ledger\u2019s hardware wallet.\n\nThat includes the ability to store BRC-20 tokens, which take inspiration from ERC-20 tokens. The experimental class of coins has notched a market cap of close to $260 million since being introduced in March, according to CoinGecko.\n\nXverse is one of the most integrated Bitcoin wallets when it comes to Ordinals-related applications, Liao said, striking partnerships with the NFT marketplace Magic Eden and the exchange OKX as well.\n\nWhile enthusiasm among venture capitalists for investing in crypto companies has waned over the past year, Liao said Ordinals piqued the interest of many.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of ways for people to make money with applications built on top of Bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, with Ordinals, even though it's just the beginning, they can see that \u2018hey, there's this demand.\u2019\u201d\n\nSupport for Ordinals came a year after the firm adapted to Stacks, a network built on top of Bitcoin that allows developers to deploy smart contracts on Bitcoin and has its own NFT ecosystem too.\n\nXverse started out as purely a Bitcoin wallet that didn\u2019t support other networks, but its goal is to become the go-to wallet for any Bitcoin-related applications, Liao explained.\n\n\u201cWe want to become the MetaMask of the Bitcoin ecosystem, but I think we can go even further beyond that,\u201d Liao said. \u201cBitcoin is bigger than Ethereum, and there's a lot of capital locked in Bitcoin that could be used in Web3 applications.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Thu 10 Aug 2023 \u25aa 8 min of reading \u25aa by Luc Jose A.\n\nDespite an unstoppable bear market, bitcoin (BTC) is still attracting investors. This infatuation with the flagship crypto is no accident. It\u2019s based on the financial relevance the asset has built up over the 14 years of its existence. A period during which the asset has seen its lows. The asset\u2019s lowest valuation was $0.001, its first estimated value in October 2009. The flagship crypto has also experienced highs. In November 2021, the price of bitcoin reached a valuation of $69,992. This figure remains, by far, the highest ever reached by bitcoin since it came into existence. Will the leading cryptocurrency return to this level again? Indeed, bitcoin seems to be facing a glass ceiling. Benefiting from the dynamics of the crypto market, the asset has twice reached a price of $30,000 this year. A level that the flagship crypto was subsequently unable to break through. Yet many players in the crypto industry don\u2019t seem to trust these trends. Indeed, many of them have repeatedly expressed their optimism in this regard. They believe that, given current economic and financial conditions, the price would explode. Could this be the reason why many asset managers are scrambling to buy as many bitcoins as possible? Find out below.\n\nThe unbridled race for Bitcoin\u2026\n\nThe price of bitcoin (BTC) is falling. But the asset is attractive, that\u2019s a fact. A fact confirmed by the operating results of certain companies in the second quarter of 2023. This is the case of Tether Limited, the crypto company behind stablecoin USDT.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, the company\u2019s CTO, made this clear in a recent speech. In it, he acknowledged the substantial investment made by Tether Limited during this financial year. This expenditure would amount to some $45.4 million. These funds were used to acquire 1,529 bitcoins.\n\nOn analysis, Tether Limited\u2019s operational choice to acquire bitcoin does not appear to be tendentious or opportunistic. Since the beginning of the year, the crypto firm had announced that it would allocate part of its quarterly profits to bitcoin. The acquisition of substantial volumes of BTC therefore follows this logic.\n\nIn line with this, up to 15% of the company\u2019s quarterly profits were used to buy bitcoin. This brought the total number of BTC held by the company to 54,000, for a portfolio valued at around $1.56 billion. Tether is therefore, to say the least, a whale of the bitcoin market.\n\nAnother company, this time a financial one, and not the least on the bitcoin market, has made similar transactions. This is MicroStrategy, the business intelligence software company co-founded by Michael J. Saylor, who is the company\u2019s Executive Chairman.\n\nAs of June 27, 2023, MicroStrategy held some 152,333 bitcoins. Total assets valued at around $4 billion. A price calculated by taking into account the current unit price of bitcoin of around $29,000. However, despite being one of the largest holders of BTC in the United States, the company has admitted to acquiring additional BTC. 467 in July, for a total of 12,333 bitcoins acquired at $347 million during the quarter.\n\n\u201cOur bitcoin holdings increased to 152,800 bitcoins as of July 31, 2023, with the addition in the second quarter of 12,333 bitcoins being the largest increase in a single quarter since Q2 2021,\u201d said MicroStrategy CFO Andrew Kang.\n\nIn the light of this data, a clear trend seems to be emerging. A bit like an arms race, some companies are in a frenzy to buy bitcoin. How can such a rush be explained? Especially since the crypto market has been showing signs of running out of steam for some time now. A number of recent and upcoming events may provide some clues.\n\n\u2026 motivated by current trends \u2026?\n\nIf companies like Tether Limited and MicroStrategy are injecting substantial funds into bitcoin, it\u2019s not for fun. There is potentially a well-thought-out strategy behind this choice, based on bitcoin and its explosive potential. At least, that\u2019s what many crypto market analysts envisage. By the end of the year for the optimists, or 2024 for the more reserved.\n\nThe basis for this outlook: first and foremost, the performance of the flagship crypto. Since the beginning of the year, it seems to have laughed off the bear market. Although it hasn\u2019t come close to its historic valuation peaks, bitcoin is still alive and kicking. The asset has remained extremely dynamic on the market, buoyed by a deleterious economic context. This situation is linked to a certain crisis of confidence in traditional currency, which is suffering from sustained inflation.\n\nFrom January 2023 to the present day, bitcoin has in fact staged an impressive rally. Its valuation has risen by almost 76%. This trend is attracting renewed interest from institutional investors. Asset manager BlackRock is the best illustration of this trend. Larry Fink, the company\u2019s boss, who was one of bitcoin\u2019s detractors, has suddenly changed his position.\n\nConvinced of the asset\u2019s relevance, the head of the company sent a Bitcoin ETF application to the SEC. Several other leading asset managers such as Fidelity, WisdomTree and Invesco followed suit. Many analysts estimated that the chances of success of these proceedings would only be a 50% winning bet. Bloomberg\u2019s ETF experts put the odds at around 65%.\n\nThe race for bitcoin could therefore be explained by these different reasons. But they may not be the only ones.\n\n\u2026 and future trends?\n\nThe halving of bitcoin could, to some extent, explain the bitcoin acquisition frenzy of Tether Limited and Microstrategy. This event, programmed into the bitcoin protocol to occur approximately every four years, is generally bullish. David Gamble, an executive at Blockware Solutions, has predicted that the crypto market will reach a market capitalization of $10 trillion. That\u2019s within the next few years. A prospect whose realization would be linked to the arrival of traditional institutional investors on the decentralized financial market (DeFi). A dynamic which, he believes, could be a positive step in DeFi\u2019s evolution.\n\nDavid Gamble acknowledges the possibility of a meteoric rise in the price of BTC at the advent of halving next year. He therefore recommended that investors consider buying as many bitcoins as possible. A way for them to anticipate a significant appreciation in the asset\u2019s value. On the basis of this argument, we can reasonably assume that Tether Limited and Microstrategy are on the right track.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bitcoin acquisition policy deployed by players such as Tether Limited and MicroStrategy is not insignificant. It reflects a trend towards investment in the flagship cryptocurrency. This dynamic seems to follow on from bitcoin\u2019s operating results this year, despite a crypto market in decline. It is also potentially the consequence of a rush by institutional investors into the decentralized finance market (DeFi). That said, firms Tether Limited and MicroStrategy appear to be gearing up to profit from a potential BTC surge. A number of financial and crypto market analysts agree.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Thu 10 Aug 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Mikaia A.\n\nAfter a 10-year hiatus, the team led by Matt Groening, father of The Simpsons, is back in action. Two weeks ago, the American platform Hulu marked the return of the cult series with the broadcast of \u201cThe Impossible Stream\u201d. This was followed by \u201cChildren of a Lesser Bog\u201d and \u201cHow the West Was 101001\u201d, all about bitcoin, cryptos and NFT.\n\nBitcoin, a star in Futurama season 11\n\nMatt Groening hasn\u2019t breathed his last. The man who created The Simpsons, a series featuring such predictions as the election of Donald Trump as POTUS and the $589 ATH for XRP, is still making waves.\n\nAs early as the first quarter of 2023, the press echoed the return of Futurama after a 10-year hiatus. If the latest news is to be believed, Hulu kept its promise by broadcasting \u201cThe Impossible Stream\u201d on its platform and Disney+ on July 24.\n\nNEW \u2013 The latest episode of Futurama features #Bitcoin\n\n\n\n\u201cThe virtual money is soaring once again. Leading to a high tech gold rush.\u201d\n\npic.twitter.com/5ICYmyvkrR \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 8, 2023 Bitcoin takes the stage in Futurama\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph, episode 3 of Futurama season 11 tackles the subject of bitcoin. Except that in the episode \u201cHow the West Was 1010001\u201d, BTC miners are mocked.\n\nHere\u2019s the story: Futurama\u2019s main characters (Fry, Leela, Bender, Amy, Hermes and co.) are saddled with debt. The robot mafia forces them to travel west to Crypto Country.\n\nThis adventure exposes them to other constraints that currently prevail in the real world. Among them: the environmental challenges of bitcoin, which cannot be separated from the high demand for materials such as thallium (in the series).\n\nIn Futurama\u2019s literal Wild West, the quest for \u201ccheap, dirty electricity\u201d is part of everyday life. The aim: to extract blocks of BTC.\n\nThis third episode, released on August 6, also highlights bitcoin\u2019s ongoing volatility. In the year 3023, i.e. in 1,000 years\u2019 time, the queen of cryptocurrencies will still not lose its volatile nature.\n\nOther cryptos in the spotlight\n\nDogecoin also got the red carpet in How the West Was 101001. Collider reports that Elon Musk\u2019s favorite memecoin occupies a very important place in Crypto Contry\u2019s Wild West.\n\nIn fact, Futurama granted a scene featuring Fry\u2019s team aboard a covered wagon entering \u201cDoge City\u201d. As they set foot in this crypto city, Professor Farnsworth was quick to extol the virtues of cryptocurrencies. He even tested the \u201cpricelessly toxic Thallium\u201d through his teeth.\n\nIn this sequence, the team was confronted with the difficulties of cryptocurrency mining: anarchy, volatility, insecurity, etc. No one reached out to them. The only prospector they spoke to was on a mission to reduce the population of Crypto Country. He died of a heart attack after achieving his goal.\n\nInterviewed by The Economic Times, Claudia Katz promised 20 episodes for Futurama season 11. And this is only the 3rd episode, with the 4th to be released on August 14.\n\nFuture Futurama releases are sure to touch on cancel culture, Covid-19, Bitcoin and NFTs.\n\nThe Futurama producer also mentioned in this interview that the war against Covid-19 won\u2019t end until 3023. This justifies the existence of an episode on vaccines. This reminds us of an alternative disavowed by the Canadian truckers behind Freedom Convoy. In spite of themselves, they promoted BTC donations.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Is Bitcoin (BSV) a Security? - CoinGeek",
        "content": "To read full Legal Opinion Click Here.\n\nInternational law firm Buffone Law Group has issued guidance to the Ayre Ventures that the original protocol of Bitcoin as represented by BSV blockchain is likely not a security under U.S. law.\n\nThe advice was no doubt sought out of prudence following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) barrage of enforcement actions against the listing of illegal digital asset securities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler had signalled that such enforcement was around the corner back in September, when he warned that the \u2018vast majority\u2019 of digital assets on exchanges were securities. Buffone had earlier issued advice that Ethereum 2.0 amounted to a security, reflecting increasing recognition by the private sector and regulators that many digital assets previously thought to not be securities do in fact meet the definition.\n\nIndeed, as the memo points out, the SEC doubled the size of its digital assets enforcement division in May 2022 and highlights that the SEC has brought at least 99 enforcement actions against digital asset companies.\n\nIn the midst of this, the advice says:\n\n\u201cOne truth remains: that Bitcoin is not a security. However today there exists a dispute over what that original Bitcoin is\u2026 BSV, which is based upon the original Bitcoin protocol and committed to keeping that protocol static, is clearly not a security.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther versions of bitcoin, including Bitcoin Core (BTC), have changed their underlying protocol, necessitating ongoing developer intervention and promotion, that raise questions about whether these digital assets have transformed into securities. Only BSV, which has remained unchanged and consistent with the original Bitcoin White Paper since bitcoin first launched in 2009, does not face these risks.\u201d\n\nBitcoin as represented by BSV blockchain does not meet the Howey test\n\nThe memo goes over the latest status of the Howey test as it applies to digital assets. Howey is a long standing-legal precedent which establishes the test for whether a given asset offering amounts to an investment contract under the U.S. securities legislation and therefore is a security.\n\nUnder Howey, an investment contract exists if there is:\n\nAn investment of money; In a common enterprise; With a reasonable expectation of profits based upon the efforts of others\n\nThere is an investment of money. This prong of Howey will almost always be met. The test does not require investment of fiat \u2013 merely an exchange of value \u201cwhich includes not only fiat money but also digital tokens and even goods and services,\u201d according to the memo.\n\nIn a common enterprise. Some dispute has arisen over what constitutes a common enterprise, and courts are generally split between requiring \u2018vertical commonality\u2019 (meaning commonality of interest between the investor and the promoter) and \u2018horizontal commonality\u2019 (meaning commonality between investors).\n\nReasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. This is the prong of the Howey test which gets the most attention in the digital assets\u2019 context.\n\nWhere an issuer has privatized their ledger and the utility of the underlying coin is required to give the asset continuing value, that has the effect of making the purchasers reliant upon the issuer for the asset\u2019s value, likely fulfilling this prong of the Howey test. \u201cAccordingly,\u201d says the memo, \u201ca touchstone for finding whether profit is expected from the effort of the promoter or third party is whether the blockchain underlying the digital asset is privatised.\u201d\n\nThis point has been the subject of new developments in the courts.\n\nThe court in the highly-publicized case of SEC v Ripple Labs recently analyzed whether Ripple\u2019s sale of XRP to various buyers fell afoul of Howey. Under this third prong, it found that only sales to institutional buyers met the Howey test; programmatic sales (i.e., public buyers on exchanges) did not because the buyers could not reasonably expect that Ripple would use the money to increase the value of XRP because the buyers could not have known their money was going to Ripple or some other seller of the asset.\n\nThough that decision was greeted with much applause from Ripple and XRP\u2019s many bagholders, it was quickly diminished by subsequent decisions. On July 31, a court with equal authority to the one in Ripple issued a decision in the SEC\u2019s case against Terraform Labs and its founder Do Kwon which expressly disagreed with the conclusion in Ripple. He said:\n\n\u201cThat a purchaser has bought the coins directly from the defendants or, instead, a secondary re-sale transaction has no impact on whether a reasonable individual would objectively view the defendant\u2019s actions and statements as evincing a promise of profits based on their efforts.\u201d\n\nYesterday August 9th, the SEC filed a letter of intent to request an interlocutory appeal to Judge Torres\u2019s July 13th summary judgement in the Ripple case.\n\nWhat this means for Bitcoin\n\nBuffone\u2019s memo sets the starting point for considering whether Bitcoin is a security: it highlights a speech given by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in 2018 where he said that Bitcoin does not qualify as a security because it functions as a replacement for currency.\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d reads the memo, \u201cChairman Clayton reasoned that any digital currency whose primary function is to serve as a substitute for fiat currency would not qualify as a security.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a speech given by former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance William Hinman made the point that Bitcoin is not a security under the Howey test and \u201cin large part focused on how the distinction between a decentralized technology and central promoters driving a blockchain can create the distinction between a commodity and security,\u201d reads the memo.\n\nAdditionally, as recently as July 2022, current SEC Gary Gensler has reiterated that Bitcoin is not a security.\n\nWhich begs the question: what is Bitcoin? The memo describes Bitcoin as \u201ca direct-exchange (or user-to-user) network through which participants may send other participants bitcoins without the need for any intermediary. The Bitcoin system is comprised of 21 million coins that are designated as bitcoins and which each includes 100 million fungible, indivisible digital tokens known as satoshis. The Bitcoin protocol uses digital signatures, hashing algorithms that publish data in clear text, and a distributed network of nodes to control the management of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe definition of Bitcoin comes from the white paper, which unambiguously describes a system of electronic cash.\n\nIn the early days when Bitcoin initially adhered to this definition, it traded under the ticker BTC. However, the memo points out that several years into Bitcoin\u2019s development a group of developers seized control of the protocol and made fundamental changes to it, including the Segregated Witness (SegWit) update in August 2016, which removed all signature data from Bitcoin transactions and put them in a separate structure. This change was intended to enable the Lightning Network, \u201ca software that could now run on top of the new protocol and created a separate network which no longer has the characteristics of a blockchain and takes advantage of the separation from the blockchain to limit the traceability of transactions.\u201d\n\nAnother update, Taproot, \u201chad the intended outcome of making it harder to audit transactions and potentially allow for the anonymous use of BTC.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese changes moved away from the digital asset concept of the Bitcoin protocol towards a cryptocurrency concept that would allow for anonymous and untraceable transactions. Because SegWit introduced a new protocol that was incompatible with the Bitcoin protocol, new coins that complied with the new and changed protocol had to be issued.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nBSV would eventually restore the original Bitcoin protocol\u2014and unlike BTC, the underlying protocol has been left untouched.\n\nThis distinction, says the memo, is key to understanding why Bitcoin as represented by BSV blockchain is not a security, while BTC very likely is. As referenced by both the Howey test and the SEC, centralized management of a blockchain is one of the key ingredients used to determine whether a digital asset is a security:\n\n\u201cFirst, centralized management often can bolster an argument that a common enterprise exists. Further, centralized management, which almost always is financially motivated, bolsters an argument an expectation of profit exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy taking a static and immutable protocol and implementing changes developed, advocated for, and implemented by a core group of developers with an obvious financial interest in BTC, BTC has opened itself to the argument that it has changed what was once a commodity into a security.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, as the SEC says, it is not enough to say you are not a duck. Merely claiming to be bitcoin will not save a coin that transforms into a security.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, the BSV blockchain had not deviated from the original Bitcoin protocol. The memo cites BSV blockchain\u2019s suitability as a platform for everyday transactions, the original vision for Bitcoin: \u201cBSV transactions are processed in a matter of seconds compared to between 10 minutes and up to 1 hour for BTC.\u201d It also points to BSV blockchain\u2019s average transaction fee of less than 1/1000 of a cent compared to BTC\u2019s average fee of around $7.25. Both these factors are reflected in the fact that BSV blockchain\u2019s daily transaction volume is over 2,500,000 per day with peaks of up to 50,000,000\u2014compared with just 450,000 per day for BTC.\n\nFurther, the memo says that the following factors weight strongly in favor of BSV\u2019s status as a commodity rather than a security:\n\nDid not do pre-mining\n\nHad no new issuance, reissuance, a secondary offering and/or airdropping in its lifetime\n\nIs based on genuine proof-of-work\n\nHas a locked base protocol according to the law\n\nIn other words: \u201cBSV does not walk like a duck nor quack like one.\u201d\n\nIn closing, the memo says that while the SEC\u2019s enforcement approach is evolving quickly, there remains one constant: Bitcoin is not a security.\n\n\u201cThe safest way to ensure any cryptocurrency is not a security is to ensure it stays true to the original Bitcoin protocol as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. That protocol was static and immutable. BSV is the only cryptocurrency utilizing that same static and immutable protocol. Meanwhile, those cryptocurrencies moving away from Nakamoto\u2019s original vision and protocol, as in the case of BTC \u2013 are increasingly at risk of securitization and being subject to SEC oversight.\u201d\n\nTo read full Legal Opinion Click Here.\n\nLondon Blockchain Conference 2023 AMA: Bitcoin at scale is all about micropayments\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "The Mating of Economic Ideas and Bitcoin - AIER - Daily Economy News",
        "content": "In an effort to better understand the intellectual foundations of what eventually came to be known as Bitcoin, we have thus far explored those of the competition in currency proposed by economist FA Hayek and the idea of building a \u201cGalt\u2019s Gulch in Cyberspace\u201d (an adaptation from Ayn Rand\u2019s novel Atlas Shrugged). We then explored the anarchic roots from David D. Friedman \u2014 with important inputs from science fiction authors Robert Heinlein and Vernor Vinge. Each of these individuals was explicitly cited at least once by Timothy C. May who managed the Cypherpunk mailing list throughout the 1990s, where he built the case for some combination of online markets powered by strong encryption, a globally-interconnected public, an internet currency of sorts that would facilitate trade \u2013 and all capable of existing in a state of anarchy.\n\nBut to understand further, we must explore the intellectual influences that economists Lawrence H. White and George Selgin had on at least two of the more prominent Cypherpunks: namely Nick Szabo and Hal Finney.\n\nNick Szabo is the man responsible for engineering a couple of the attempts at an internet-native, privately-issued currency before Bitcoin: \u2018The God Protocols\u2019 (1999) and \u2018bit gold\u2019 (2005, now considered a direct precursor to Bitcoin). Hal Finney launched his own attempt in 2004 called \u2018Reusable Proofs of Work\u2019 (RPOW). None of these attempts at a digital currency was actually programmed up to a finished product; they were merely conceptualized in writing and (in RPOW\u2019s case) minimal amounts of code. Despite neither Szabo nor Finney being cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi later stated that Bitcoin was an implementation of Szabo\u2019s \u2018bit gold\u2019 (along with Wei Dai\u2019s \u2018b-money\u2019). As for Finney, he also happened to be the first recipient of a bitcoin transaction, from Satoshi himself, and famously tweeted \u201cRunning bitcoin\u201d on January 11th, 2009 \u2013 just eight days after Bitcoin went live. In sum, both Szabo and Finney made significant contributions to the evolution of ideas that inevitably led to what we now refer to as Bitcoin.\n\nBut to build a sound and scalable digital currency, one must not merely possess expertise in programming and cryptography. One must also understand what makes a good money in the first place. Szabo\u2019s blog \u201cUnenumerated\u201d takes a deep dive into the history of money (among many other topics), and a widely-read piece of his (among bitcoiners and the like) \u201cShelling Out\u201d contains references to the 19th century economist Carl Menger, who wrote about the spontaneous emergence of money. But interestingly, Szabo and Finney had also studied the work of Lawrence H. White and George Selgin.\n\nWhite and Selgin\u2019s influences on prominent Cypherpunks\n\nOne common research focus across the careers of White and Selgin is competition in currency, a theme pioneered by FA Hayek during the high inflation years of the 1970s, with his important book on the topic: The Denationalisation of Money.\n\nIn the 1990s, White and Finney had a friendly debate of ideas back-and-forth via three published articles in Extropy magazine. Finney argued in a 1993 article that the internet would enable the possibility of an internet native currency (not backed by fiat or goods in the real world); White replied in 1995 that he was skeptical, arguing the difficulty of getting away from the network effect of fiat currencies; Finney responded in kind in 1996.\n\nIn 2010, Finney referred to Selgin\u2019s 1988 book The Theory of Free Banking as one of his own influences in the so-called \u201cBitcoin Forum\u201d, a platform for discussion for early bitcoiners. \u201cGeorge Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail\u201d, Finney wrote, \u201cand he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.\u201d\n\nIn an appearance on Peter McCormack\u2019s What Bitcoin Did podcast in 2019, Szabo credits both White and Selgin for shaping his own thinking, explaining that:\n\n\u201cI was doing research on the history of money and working my way backwards, part of the history of money was private banking, where private banks would issue money, IOUs, bank notes and George Selgin and Larry White were the main people I read on that one. That was inspiring, but then you read later how it failed and it got usurped by central banks and then later on, maybe 100, 200 years later, the central banks get turned into fiat currency.\u201d\n\nBeyond the Cypherpunk mailing list, White and Selgin were all participants of a separate private mailing list with some of the prominent Cypherpunks called \u2018Libtech\u2019 in the late-1990s. Szabo recounts about the Libtech experience that \u201cmyself, Wei Dai, Hal Finney, Larry White, George Selgin and a few others were on a mailing list I created called Libtech and that\u2019s where I came up with Bitgold [sic], and Wei Dai came up with b-money, and we had great discussions on there.\u201d\n\nIn a 2019 Twitter thread, Szabo also credited both White and Selgin on both Finney\u2019s and his own thinking about how a free banking system might work under a Bitcoin standard, suggesting that Layer 2 technologies such as the Lightning Network provide a more trust-minimized way of achieving it.\n\nWhite and Selgin on Bitcoin\n\nBoth White and Selgin critique Bitcoin from different angles. With White, the ideal money is one with a stable purchasing power (a point repeatedly emphasized by Hayek), while Selgin\u2019s ideal money \u201cwould stabilize nominal spending\u201d (he tells me by email) \u201cwhile allowing the price level to vary with changes in the state of total factor productivity.\u201d\n\nIn White\u2019s new book Better Money: Gold, Fiat, or Bitcoin?, he writes that \u201c[because Bitcoin\u2019s] supply curve is vertical, the impact of demand shifts is entirely on price and not at all on quantity. In this respect purchasing-power volatility is baked into Bitcoin\u2019s design.\u201d He goes on to say that \u201cmy own view is that the volatility of Bitcoin\u2019s purchasing power makes its widespread use as a medium of exchange very unlikely\u2026 but only time will tell.\u201d\n\nSelgin calls Bitcoin a \u201csynthetic commodity money\u201d meaning that, like fiat, any non-monetary use is less obvious, but like a commodity it \u201cis naturally or inevitably scarce.\u201d (He considers \u201cmere investment use\u201d to be non-monetary). He also argues that the advantage of a synthetic commodity money \u201cis precisely that by resorting to it one can avoid leaving the management of money either to central bankers or to the blind forces of nature. Instead, supply is determined once and for all by artificially arranged resource constraints.\u201d He goes on to say that a \u201csynthetic commodity monetary regime might perform better than either existing fiat money regimes or than potential commodity money alternatives\u201d but emphasizes the unlikeliness of any government to adopt such a regime.\n\nIn 1989, White suggested the possibility of a monetary policy with a predetermined supply schedule, applying a solution proposed by Ronald Coase to the \u201cassurance problem.\u201d As explained in White\u2019s new book, to understand the Coasean assurance problem, we can think of potential buyers that may be hesitant to purchase, say, artwork from an artist in the present, knowing that the artist can still later reproduce copies of the artwork and sell at a lower price to future buyers, yet at a price still above the artist\u2019s marginal cost of production. One solution to calm potential buyers would be for the artist to number each piece of artwork (#7 of 100, etc.). Satoshi built a similar quantity commitment into Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy. White writes that \u201cDespite recognizing, many years before the introduction of Bitcoin, that a quantity commitment device could in principle solve the Coasean assurance problem for a free-market irredeemable money, [\u2026] I did not foresee that the device could or would in practice be used to successfully launch a medium of exchange.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a presentation given to the Center for Market Education in Malaysia, White does concede that Bitcoin\u2019s purchasing power volatility could dampen if its use as a medium of exchange would increase substantially as such use would mean less volatile demand. He also points out that banking on a Bitcoin standard would go a long way to help.\n\nConclusion\n\nLawrence H. White and George Selgin\u2019s career-long efforts to understand better money ultimately served as contributions to the climate of ideas that inevitably shaped the thinking of at least two of the most prominent Cypherpunks \u2013 Nick Szabo and Hal Finney \u2013 who worked to make something like Bitcoin a reality in the first place.\n\nWhether Bitcoin\u2019s volatility will remain a stumbling block in the way of its eventual widespread adoption as a medium of exchange remains to be seen. As Bitcoin is a highly decentralized and an antifragile system with no real-world backed assets that can be seized to shut it down, and as it has already reached a fair bit of scale globally, it (to me) appears to be the only realistic candidate to (by \u201csly roundabout way\u201d, as Hayek proposed) introduce something that government cannot stop. As such, volatility may be the price we pay to win the long game.\n\n\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: I have chapter 5 of Professor White\u2019s book Better Money to thank for alerting me to several of the sources referenced in this article."

Following that, there were nine new purchase announcements on different days, until June 30, 2022 \u2014 all done on Bukele\u2019s official Twitter (X) account.\n\nBesides Nayib Bukele\u2019s own statements, there is no evidence that the country has ever bought one single Bitcoin, but \u2014 for this report \u2014 we are assuming that all his words are truthful and accurate.\n\nEl Salvador bought today 80 #BTC at $19,000 each!#Bitcoin is the future!\n\n\n\nThank you for selling cheap \ud83d\ude09 pic.twitter.com/ZHwr0Ln1Ze \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) July 1, 2022\n\nWith a total investment of around $103.23 million for 2,381 BTC (at an average price of $43,357.14/btc), the country\u2019s wallet is now down around $33 million (-32%), considering Bitcoin\u2019s spot price of $29,400, by press time.\n\nBitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, highly promoted as \u2018sound money\u2019; followed by Ethereum (ETH), promoted as \u2018ultra-sound money\u2019.\n\nThis makes Finbold wonder: What if El Salvador had bought Ethereum over Bitcoin?\n\nWhat if El Salvador had bought Ethereum?\n\nAccording to data collected by Finbold\u2019s team \u2014 considering only the purchases from September 6, 2021 to June 30, 2022 \u2014 Nayib Bukele made the least worse investment decision with BTC than with ETH.\n\nIf El Salvador had used the same amount in US Dollars to buy Ethereum, on each of the same days Bukele announced the Bitcoin\u2019s purchases, according to historical price data by Coingecko, the country would be losing $15 million more than the current losses.\n\nThese investments would now be worth around $55.60 million, holding 30,053.12 ETH, for a 46.14% loss.\n\nEl Salvador purchases simulation with Ethereum (Vinicius Barbosa / Finbold)\n\nIf El Salvador had staked all these Ethereum\u2019s on July 1, 2022, considering an average yield of 3.29% annually, the country\u2019s treasury would have earned around $1.83 million by now, still worse than by simply holding Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin daily purchases by El Salvador\n\nOn November 17, 2022, the president once again talked about Bitcoin purchases, declaring that he would be buying 1 BTC per day starting on November 18 within El Salvador\u2019s treasury. Since then, there have been no related updates made publicly, which keeps the promise alive.\n\nWe are buying one #Bitcoin every day starting tomorrow. \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) November 17, 2022\n\nFinbold also collected historical price data from Coingecko for a raw simulation on the possible outcome if (A) Nayib Bukele kept his promises of buying 1 BTC per day since November 18, 2022; and (B) El Salvador had made daily ETH purchases with the same amount in USD.\n\nThere would have been a total of 267 Bitcoin purchases, at an average price of $24,692.13 per BTC, resulting in a current position of $7.85 million, profiting around $1.25 million (+19.07%) for these 267 days only. This would have reduced El Salvador\u2019s total losses to around $31.85 million.\n\nEl Salvador purchases simulation with Ethereum (Vinicius Barbosa / Finbold)\n\nThe daily performance for Ethereum purchases would also have been worse than Bitcoin\u2019s. Sitting in a current amount of around $7.27 million, for an estimated profit of $0.67 million (+10.38%), making a meaningless impact on the bigger outcome.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s monumental performance in recent years, as well as the increasing coverage of digital assets in the mainstream media, have attracted traders of all shapes and sizes looking to break into the world of cryptocurrency. While retail investors typically look to purchase modest amounts, you may want to purchase a large amount of Bitcoin in one go, which is where certain exchanges and OTC desks come in handy. By using one of these specialised services, you will be able to cut down on the costs involved compared to using a regular exchange.\n\nDisclaimer: This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade.\n\nBefore going any further, it\u2019s important to consider what actually constitutes a large amount of bitcoin. Of course, the definition of \u201clarge\u201d will be different for everyone. A sizable trade for you will vary depending on factors like your income, net wealth, experience with digital currency and overall level of risk tolerance.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of this guide, we\u2019re talking about individual trades worth anywhere north of $10,000 and potentially into hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.\n\nOptions for buying a large amount of bitcoin\n\nThe two main options when buying a lot of bitcoin are to either purchase through a traditional cryptocurrency exchange or to use an over-the-counter (OTC) exchange. Each type of platform has its pros and cons, so let\u2019s take a closer look at which one might be right for you.\n\nLarge transactions on traditional cryptocurrency exchanges: pros and cons\n\nTraditional exchanges offer a simple and straightforward way for their customers to buy bitcoin and other crypto coins. These centralised platforms allow buyers and sellers to trade cryptocurrencies based on current market prices, with the exchange acting as an intermediary between the two parties. Examples of such exchanges include Binance, CoinSpot and Coinbase.\n\nYou register for an account, deposit fiat or cryptocurrency to your trading balance, and then place an order to buy your desired number of coins. All buy and sell offers are listed in a publicly available order book.\n\nPros\n\nEasy to use. Traditional cryptocurrency exchanges are designed to make it simple and straightforward to buy coins and tokens. If you\u2019re new to the world of cryptocurrency, they\u2019re generally one of the easier ways to purchase coins and tokens.\n\nTraditional cryptocurrency exchanges are designed to make it simple and straightforward to buy coins and tokens.

This can help a new user enter the marketplace and start trading. Trade up to $100,000 per day. While transaction limits vary substantially between exchanges and can be based on your level of verification, some platforms will allow you to buy up to $50,000 or even $100,000 of bitcoin per day.\n\nAccess to a wide range of coins and tokens. The list of supported currencies varies from one exchange to the next, but many platforms allow you to go beyond bitcoin and trade an extensive selection of altcoins.\n\nCons\n\nTransaction and withdrawal limits. Traditional exchanges have much lower transaction and withdrawal limits than OTC exchanges. For example, if you\u2019re a new customer, you may be limited to a daily trading limit of $2,000 or $3,000. Furthermore, your options for withdrawing funds may be restricted or capped.\n\nTraditional exchanges have much lower transaction and withdrawal limits than OTC exchanges.

Raising transaction and withdrawal limits takes time. Many exchanges offer different transaction limits to their customers based on their level of verification, so you may need to provide additional personal details or proof of ID to raise your limit. Other platforms will only allow you to trade larger amounts once you\u2019ve been a customer for a specified period of time or only if you\u2019re a frequent trader.\n\nMany exchanges offer different transaction limits to their customers based on their level of verification, so you may need to provide additional personal details or proof of ID to raise your limit.

As cryptocurrency markets are still in their infancy and there are hundreds of exchanges to choose from, there may not be sufficient liquidity on your chosen platform to fulfil a large trade in one transaction. When this happens, your transaction will be split into several smaller trades and could lead to slippage.\n\nAs cryptocurrency markets are still in their infancy and there are hundreds of exchanges to choose from, there may not be sufficient liquidity on your chosen platform to fulfil a large trade in one transaction.

Slippage occurs when the market moves against you before your trade can be completed, resulting in the total cost of the transaction being more expensive than expected. It is often associated with large orders that take longer than usual to fill.\n\nSlippage occurs when the market moves against you before your trade can be completed, resulting in the total cost of the transaction being more expensive than expected. It is often associated with large orders that take longer than usual to fill. Risk of hacking and theft. Storing funds in an exchange wallet for any length of time exposes you to the risk of hacking and theft. There have been dozens of well-publicised examples of crypto exchanges falling victim to hacks, which is particularly worrying for anyone looking to spend a large amount.\n\nTraditional exchanges compared\n\nWhich traditional cryptocurrency exchanges are well set up to support large trading amounts? Check out the brief reviews below for more details on the transaction and withdrawal limits that apply on a selection of popular exchanges, as well as the steps you\u2019ll need to complete to access those limits.

If your account is verified, you can withdraw a maximum of 200 BTC, 2,000 ETH or 5,000 LTC.\n\nHoubi review\n\nLarge transactions on OTC exchanges: pros and cons\n\nOTC trading refers to any cryptocurrency trading that takes place away from conventional crypto exchanges. While trades can be arranged peer-to-peer using online chat rooms like #bitcoin-otc, recent years have seen the emergence of an increasing number of OTC brokers. These brokers specialise in helping large-volume traders buy and sell substantial amounts of cryptocurrency and avoiding slippage.\n\nPros\n\nBetter value for money. OTC brokers can offer a higher level of liquidity than conventional exchanges, which means that they can help you access one single price for a buy order. This removes the risk of slippage and means a lower total transaction cost.\n\nOTC brokers can offer a higher level of liquidity than conventional exchanges, which means that they can help you access one single price for a buy order.

        "title": "Post-2024 Bitcoin Halving Could Lead To A 'Major Bear Market,' Expert Warns | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) investors and enthusiasts are bracing themselves for a potential seismic shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, as a prominent analyst warns that the post-2024 Bitcoin halving could usher in a \u201cmajor bear market.\u201d\n\nCrediBULL Crypto has stirred the crypto community with his recent analysis, suggesting that the upcoming halving event might not be the catalyst for a bull run, as many expect.\n\nBitcoin halving events, which occur roughly every four years, have long been closely watched by investors due to their historical impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price trajectory. The halving mechanism is built into the cryptocurrency\u2019s code and reduces the block reward miners receive by half.\n\nThis scarcity-driven event often leads to supply shocks and, historically, has sparked significant price rallies. The previous halvings were indeed followed by remarkable bull runs. However, CrediBULL Crypto suggests a paradigm shift may be on the horizon.\n\nBitcoin Bull Market Peak\n\nCrediBULL Crypto\u2019s analysis challenges the conventional narrative surrounding BTC halving cycles. While many have considered the halving events as the starting point of new bull cycles, CrediBULL argues that the post-2024 halving might mark the peak of the ongoing bull market cycle, which he posits began in 2018 when Bitcoin was priced at $3,000.\n\nWhy the next $BTC halving in April/May 2024 will likely mark our bull cycle TOP rather than the \u201cstart\u201d like many are expecting and why we will likely be in the depths of a MAJOR bear market by 2025: I\u2019ve previously explained that the amount of time we are spending\u2026 pic.twitter.com/lQrGSo4rRs \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) August 10, 2023\n\nThis alternative timeline implies that the cryptocurrency is still within a prolonged bull market, and he anticipates a higher price peak than the previous record of $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nCrediBULL\u2019s assertion is grounded in his interpretation of historical data, raising intriguing questions about the cyclical nature of Bitcoin\u2019s price movements and the broader factors influencing its trajectory.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Bitcoin $BTC Amount of HODLed or Lost Coins just reached a 5-year high of 7,803,692.388 BTC View metric:https://t.co/dJK8rxBVD3 pic.twitter.com/vb4dTp2Ezp \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 9, 2023\n\nHODLers Unfazed Amid Uncertainty\n\nAs the debate over Bitcoin\u2019s future intensifies, recent data from Glassnode provides a nuanced perspective. The amount of \u201cHODLed\u201d or lost Bitcoin, those coins held tightly by long-term investors, has surged to a new five-year high, reaching 7.8 million Bitcoins.\n\nThis phenomenon suggests that a significant portion of Bitcoin holders remains undeterred by market fluctuations, choosing to retain their investments rather than capitulating amid potential uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) retains position in the $29k territory. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nEnduring Market Sentiment\n\nBitcoin stands at $29,415.22 via CoinGecko, with a minor 0.3% decline in the past 24 hours, and a modest 0.9% rise over the last seven days. Nevertheless, the resilience displayed by committed HODLers may hint at a more complex and enduring market sentiment.\n\nAs the crypto community ponders the potential implications of the post-2024 halving, CrediBULL Crypto\u2019s contrarian perspective challenges the prevailing wisdom and underscores the need for ongoing scrutiny of the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nInvestors are left to contemplate whether this forecasted bear market will materialize, or if the crypto market\u2019s resilience will once again defy expectations.\n\nFeatured image from Lenexa Manufacturing"

        "content": "In a groundbreaking move, June witnessed leading financial powerhouse BlackRock, along with five other traditional financial (TradFi) institutions, submitting applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThis significant development has rekindled hope within the cryptocurrency community regarding the potential institutional acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC). Following swiftly, in July, the SEC took a pivotal stride by accepting all six proposals for review, initiating the initial phase of its deliberation to determine the fate of the eagerly anticipated spot BTC ETF.\n\nWhile the securities regulator refrained from offering a precise timeline for its final decision, there is a decent possibility that the agency might unveil its verdict on one of the applications as early as today, August 11th.\n\nThree possible scenarios\n\nNotably, the deadline for the SEC to decide on ARKInvest\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF is on Sunday, August 13, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed on August 10.\n\nSEC deadline dates for spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Source: Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart\n\nHowever, given that it is the last day before the weekend, Seyffart said he expects the SEC to deliver the announcement today after the market close.\n\nAccording to crypto expert Jelle, there are three possible scenarios regarding the SEC\u2019s expected August 11 announcement. He said the securities watchdog \u201ccan either postpone their decision, approve the ETF, or deny it.\u201d\n\nSeyffart, meanwhile, said he is \u2018fully expecting a delay\u201d from the SEC.\n\nWhat does this mean for Bitcoin?\n\nThe impending announcement from the SEC regarding ARKInvest\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application has the potential to trigger varied impacts on BTC\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nShould the regulatory body grant approval, it could serve as a significant catalyst propelling the leading crypto coin\u2019s price higher. This favorable decision would not only instill optimism regarding other institutional applications but also bolster the overall prospects of Bitcoin\u2019s adoption within the mainstream finance space.\n\nConversely, the prospect of an outright denial, although least likely according to expert opinions, could exert some bearish pressure on BTC. Nevertheless, any downward movement is anticipated to be limited, considering there are five other pending applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAlternatively, the SEC might choose to defer its decision, leading to a relatively muted influence on BTC\u2019s price. This scenario aligns with the most probable outcome given historical regulatory tendencies.\n\nIn any case, the forthcoming SEC decision holds considerable potential to reshape BTC\u2019s price dynamics and its trajectory toward mainstream institutional adoption."
