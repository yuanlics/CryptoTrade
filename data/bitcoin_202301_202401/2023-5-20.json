        "title": "A husband hid $500,000 in bitcoin during a divorce \u2014 and got busted by a crypto hunter - CNBC",
        "content": "watch now\n\nA few months into her divorce proceedings, Sarita thought it was suspicious that her spouse, who earned $3 million annually, didn't have many assets. After spending half a year on discovery and enlisting the help of a forensic accountant, the New York housewife eventually tracked down 12 bitcoins \u2014 then worth half a million dollars \u2014 in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet. Sarita, who was married for a decade and asked to use a pseudonym to protect herself from retaliation, said she felt blindsided by her husband's cryptocurrency investment. \"I know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn't know much about it,\" Sarita said. \"It was never even a thought in my mind, because it's not like we were discussing it or making investments together. ... It was definitely a shock.\" The world of financial infidelity has become increasingly sophisticated, as investors \"hop\" coins across blockchains and sink their cash into metaverse properties. An NBC News poll found that 1 in 5 Americans have invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, with men between the ages of 18 and 49 accounting for the highest share of all demographic groups. CNBC spoke with divorce attorneys from Florida, New York, Texas and California, blockchain forensic investigators, financial advisors, as well as spouses who were either hunting down virtual coins or the crypto holders themselves. Most agree that the law can't keep up with all the new ways that people earn and safeguard digital assets that largely exist outside the reach of centralized intermediaries such as banks. Family and marital law attorney Kim Nutter said she first dove into the crypto vernacular in 2015 but that the state of Florida, where her practice is based, only recently inserted \"cryptocurrency\" into the standard request for production of documents \u2014 a key part of establishing the couple's marital property during the discovery process. \"I really still think the law is trying to catch up with this novel form of currency, even though it's been around for quite a while,\" Nutter said. \"What I find in litigation is because this is so new to all of us, even the most seasoned attorneys \u2014 unless you're really going out of your way to study this \u2014 educating the court, knowing what to ask for, and finding the right experts, it's much more of a scramble to me than other areas of law which had been around much longer,\" she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nHow crypto hunters track down coins\n\nHunting hidden crypto stashes in divorce has created an entirely new job category of forensic investigators. CNBC spoke with several of these crypto hunters, and they say that while the blockchain is a public ledger, some spouses have become very good at covering their financial tracks. \"If you have a spouse that's very tech savvy, and one that isn't, it can be somewhat easy to hide those assets,\" divorce attorney Kelly Burris told CNBC. \"The thing with cryptocurrency is it's not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can't subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody's cryptocurrency holdings,\" Burris said. She said she sees explicit cryptocurrency requests in discovery in 40% to 50% of her cases. The Austin, Texas-based attorney told CNBC that the ideal way to get information on a spouse's crypto holdings is to subpoena that information from a centralized crypto exchange. Otherwise, the process often involves a forensic analysis of their computer or phone to identify a wallet address and then a subsequent blockchain analysis. \"Crypto asset forensics, cryptocurrency forensics, and blockchain forensics have become a significant part of our practice and by far, the fastest growing part of our practice,\" said Nick Himonidis, a New York-based forensic investigator. Himonidis, who is also a licensed private investigator and a computer forensic expert, estimates that 25% of his divorce-related cases involve some elements of cryptocurrency. Some of those cases, he said, are simple and straightforward \u2014 situations where, for example, a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin is a custodial asset held in a brokerage account or on a trading platform such as Coinbase . \"These companies keep records just like your broker at Morgan Stanley would keep records of your trades,\" he said. Other cases are what Himonidis describes as the \"whole enchilada.\" \"They're calling us because they want to get us appointed as the neutral forensic cryptocurrency expert to marshal and account for the party's crypto assets and track down any undisclosed crypto assets that one party may have,\" he said. When Himonidis first got into hunting crypto, it was all about bitcoin, ether and a handful of other coins. CoinMarketCap now lists more than 24,000 cryptocurrencies, with a collective market cap of $1.1 trillion. \"There's not just a couple of blockchains to worry about anymore. There's hundreds and hundreds of coins out there on their own little independent blockchains,\" he said. One of the core tenets of bitcoin is that its public ledger, which stores all token transactions in its history, is visible to everyone. But there is a subset of cryptocurrencies known as privacy tokens, which have anonymity features built into them. Coins such as monero, dash and zcash, which operate on their own blockchains, disguise practically all transaction details, including the identity of the sender and recipient, as well as the transaction amount. Himonidis said it is \"virtually impossible\" to trace and de-anonymize transactions in monero. In one case, Himonidis found around $700,000 worth of monero on a MacBook that turned up in discovery. \"We found something called a command line wallet for monero,\" Himonidis said, describing it as a kind of software wallet. \"You can't find it with the Finder on the Mac. You need to go into a command line prompt to access this wallet \u2014 a Bash shell command on a Mac environment.\" Multiple investigators and attorneys told CNBC that they are always on the lookout for any type of crypto \u2014 but particularly privacy tokens. There is also special attention paid to any kind of hardware wallet or computing device, which can double as a form of \"cold storage\" for cryptocurrencies. People who hold their own cryptocurrency can store it \"hot,\" \"cold\" or some combination of the two. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and allows owners relatively easy access to their coins so they can spend their crypto. The trade-off for convenience is potential exposure to bad actors \u2014 and forensic investigators working for divorce attorneys.\n\nA person holds a cryptocurrency hardware wallet. Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt | AFP | Getty Images\n\nWith cold storage, the private keys \u2014 or the passwords that enable the crypto to be moved out of the wallet \u2014 are stored on devices, such as computers, that are not connected to the internet. Thumb drive-size devices, such as a Trezor or Ledger, offer another way to secure crypto tokens cold by safeguarding both the crypto itself and the keys to access it. Mark DiMichael, who has been in the forensic accounting field for more than 14 years and is a certified cryptocurrency forensic investigator, described one case to CNBC in which a divorcing couple had a stand-off over a password-protected Ledger device. In the case, DiMichael said, the husband had a Ledger and then the wife found the device in the house and took it. \"So the wife had the Ledger, but she didn't know the pin number, or password. And the husband \u2014 he knew the pin number, but he didn't have the Ledger.\" Neither could access the funds without the cooperation of the other. DiMichael, who said he has tracked down millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency since he began tracing digital assets in 2018, explained that when crypto is stored cold, it may be more difficult to seize but it is still traceable. \"If they're doing on-chain transactions and they move something to cold storage, it's still visible on the blockchain,\" he said. DiMichael told CNBC that in a divorce case if you can at least prove that the crypto is there \u2014 or that it hasn't been sold \u2014 that's usually sufficient for a judge. If a spouse bought 100 bitcoins on Coinbase , for example, and later transferred the currency off an exchange to a wallet, it's still sitting there and fully visible on the blockchain. A court can then order other remedies to retrieve those funds, according to DiMichael. New York divorce attorney Sandra Radna told CNBC that right at the beginning of a case, when she serves the summons and complaint for a divorce, she also asks for a preservation of assets \u2014 known as the \"automatic orders\" in New York. At this point, Radna said, she singles out computer hard drives in her request, to ensure that nothing will be destroyed. This is key since these devices are what the forensic investigator uses to determine where the assets \u2014 both crypto and otherwise \u2014 went. \"They go through the hard drive of the computer to look for ticker symbols within emails, which is how they can see what purchases were made,\" Radna said. Radna said she also asks for information such as a spouse's \"public keys,\" which she described as being almost like an account number on the blockchain. Currently, much of the world runs on something called asymmetric cryptography, in which individuals use a private and public key pair to access things such as email and crypto wallets. A private key is a secure code that grants the owner access to their crypto holdings \u2014 whereas the public key is a unique wallet address. With the public key, it is possible to find a full history of every transaction made into or out of that wallet. \"If you have that information, you will be able to see every transaction that they did, and it's something that the attorneys are able to get as part of discovery because it's not giving a private number, a private key,\" Radna said. Bill Callahan of the Blockchain Intelligence Group said that with that wallet address, crypto hunters are able to tell the attorney or the attorney's investigator that they should go to a specific exchange to request more information. \"One of the things we're looking for are the on- and off-ramps. We're looking to see how the money came on to the blockchain, where it may be, and then where it's off to,\" Callahan said. He said the flow of funds can also show whether something was purposely hidden through an obfuscation technique such as using a crypto asset mixer. These so-called mixers are designed to obscure trails of funds by blending someone's tokens with a pool of other individuals' assets on the platform. They go beyond traditional crypto platforms in further concealing the identity of the people involved in transactions. \"We can kind of track and trace the flow after the proceedings are over to see if something was purposely hidden,\" Callahan said. \"The blockchain never forgets.\" In one case, Himonidis said, he had to track around $2.3 million that was emptied out of a Coinbase account within a few months of divorce proceedings commencing. The crypto coins hadn't been cashed out to fiat but instead moved as crypto to addresses outside Coinbase in a series of approximately 14 outbound transfers. \"All of it wound up in two or three different wallets on a foreign exchange \u2014 a place like Coinbase, but in a foreign country that does not operate in the U.S. and is not subject to the laws and jurisdiction in the United States,\" Himonidis told CNBC. DiMichael said he has run into similar issues with cases where funds were transferred to a global Binance account, and he was, therefore, unable to subpoena records since the funds were in an untouchable jurisdiction. Tracking assets gets especially complicated when investors begin to move their tokens across blockchains. DiMichael said \"chain hopping\" \u2014 a person switching from one blockchain to another very quickly \u2014 is an increasingly common technique used to throw off investigators. Blockchains have their own native tokens. With ethereum, for example, the token is ether. Developers have built cross-chain bridges to let users send tokens from one chain to another. Transfers of digital assets between chains has helped to expand the crypto market by giving people more ways to pay and transact. Cross-chain bridges are vital to the development of the decentralized finance, or DeFi, space, which is crypto's alternative to the banking system. But in a divorce case these bridges make it difficult for investigators to follow the trail of tokens. Take the crypto token polka dot, which is trading at around $5.40 and has a market valuation of over $6.3 billion. Because the virtual coin is on its own blockchain, when someone wants to trade it they need to \"wrap it\" in order to buy and sell it on the ethereum blockchain, Himonidis told CNBC. Wrapped tokens are pegged to the value of the original coin but are interoperable with other blockchains. \"If we need to start tracing stuff like that, it gets very complicated,\" said Himonidis. \"When they do coin swaps, now we're jumping \u2014 literally jumping \u2014 blockchains, trying to trace the funds. It was complicated enough before, and now, it's gotten exponentially more complicated in just the last year or two.\" Himonidis said he and his firm are able to follow funds across blockchains using a tool previously only available to law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service, and financial institutions that need it for their know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering functions. But even with new search tools, Himonidis described his work as a literal race to try to keep up with the latest in rapidly evolving crypto tech. \"It lends itself very well to people who have figured out how it works and understand what's going on there,\" said Himonidis. \"It's this constant arms race.\" DiMichael agrees, telling CNBC it was \"inevitable\" that these kinds of obfuscation techniques would crop up given the amount of money in the crypto ecosystem now, even in the midst of a down market. \"But it is still coming as a total shock to the so-called non-monied spouses,\" DiMichael said. Many centralized exchanges such as Gemini offer customers the option to stake their tokens in order to earn yield on their digital assets that would otherwise sit idle on the platform. With crypto staking, investors typically vault their crypto assets with a blockchain validator, which verifies the accuracy of transactions on the blockchain. Investors can receive additional crypto tokens as a reward for locking away those assets. In one of his divorce cases, DiMichael said, the husband disclosed the cryptocurrencies he owned, but he didn't disclose the tokens that were staked. \"The ones that he staked, he wasn't really counting those in his numbers, so I uncovered that through the investigative process,\" DiMichael said. \"Even though this cryptocurrency wasn't in his wallet anymore, he still had rights to it.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nValuing crypto property in divorce court\n\nEven when both parties in a divorce are totally above board on discovery, volatility in the crypto market can prove to be a major issue when attorneys try to value a marital estate. NodeBaron, a 36-year-old vascular surgical engineer and veteran who asked to be identified by his Twitter username, said he liquidated his stake in dogecoin for around $5,000 during his divorce. Six months later, his holdings would have been worth close to $1 million. \"The cost to get a divorce was almost like a million-dollar decision,\" he said. Divorce attorney Alexandra Mussallem said that because California, where her practice is based, is a community-property state, she often advises her clients on whether to stay in a particular asset \u2014 that is, to take half of a community asset in kind versus seeking a liquidated value. \"With volatile investments, the right strategy for a spouse trying to build a stable asset base will be to seek a cash buyout at market value on crypto holdings,\" said Mussallem, adding that it is a question of managing risk. The spouse with higher risk tolerance may be eager to cash out their partner and retain the crypto asset, given the heavy fluctuations in the crypto market, she said. Burris, the Texas-based attorney, said that in her first crypto case, around five years ago, the husband wanted to buy the wife out of his crypto holdings \u2014 which ultimately proved to be a good decision for him, given the rapid price appreciation in the crypto market since 2020. New York is an equitable distribution state, meaning that a spouse gets 50% of the marital assets accumulated during the marriage. Radna, the New York divorce attorney, told CNBC that digital assets can be taken in two ways. \"One way is to say, what is the value of that digital asset today, and we divide that up,\" she said, calling the process analogous to stocks. \"You can either take the shares of stock, or you can take the value of that.\" In an up market, Radna said, spouses typically opt for taking the value of the crypto holdings.\n\nwatch now\n\nValuing and dividing a marital estate can become especially problematic when spouses diversify their crypto portfolio into metaverse properties and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Despite the NFT market collectively losing nearly $2 trillion since its peak in 2021, blue-chip series such as Bored Ape Yacht Club still have a floor price of more than $80,000. \"You have digital land as NFTs, you have digital artwork as NFTs, you have digital metaverse clothing in NFTs,\" said DiMichael, adding that one of his clients had sold $80 million worth of NFTs. DiMichael, who first spoke with CNBC in 2022, said that if a spouse has a couple of NFTs from a collection like the Bored Ape Yacht Club or Crypto Punks, it could add a couple hundred thousand dollars to the marital estate. \"NFTs are really driving me nuts. How do I find the real expert to value the NFT, which is my obligation for a court of law?\" said Nutter, the Florida divorce attorney, referring to the Daubert standard, a rule that governs the admissibility of expert witness testimony in court. \"It requires more peer reviews, articles, a lot more science and community acceptance, which is challenging when you have something particularly like an NFT.\" \"NFTs are kind of new, and people know what they are, but to find somebody who has the level of expertise that could satisfy a court Daubert challenge and questioning I think is problematic for pretty much everybody,\" she said. \"Doesn't matter what side of the coin you're on.\" Radna, who mostly handles litigated divorces and has been practicing for 30 years, said she specifically looks for digital real estate assets in the metaverse when she requests discovery. \"You think it's not real, but they make real income from it,\" said Radna. \"They can get paid for someone to rent that digital real estate where they can have advertising and a billboard, but it would be in the metaverse.\" If a spouse owns digital real estate and they're getting rent for it, that would be income and counted in the divorce, according to Radna, who said 20% of her caseload has involved crypto in the last few years. \"It's a whole new world, and people should be aware of it,\" she added. Certified financial planner and analyst Davon Barrett told CNBC that with a traditional asset class, he can just give a divorce agreement to Fidelity, for example, and the company will take care of the split on its own. \"But with cryptocurrency, it's a newer space,\" said Barrett, the lead advisor at Francis Financial in New York. \"It's harder to get customer service on the phone at times, so splitting it becomes a little bit more difficult.\" The tax implications are another major consideration when choosing how to divide crypto assets. The IRS treats cryptocurrencies like property, meaning that each time you spend, exchange or sell your tokens, you're logging a taxable event. There's always a difference between how much you paid for your crypto, which is the cost basis, and the market value at the time you spend it. That difference can trigger capital gains taxes. \"There are people who bought bitcoin years ago, so their cost basis was $10,000,\" Barrett said. He gave a hypothetical where a client would potentially be smarter to keep $500,000 in cash, versus bitcoin, so that their spouse is the one stuck with the gains. \"The government, they may not have gotten it in the past, but Uncle Sam is really good about getting his money,\" Barrett said. \"I think that you have your head in the sand if you don't think that this is something that's here to stay, even if during a down market,\" Radna said. \"Like any other asset, just like the stock market, there's going to be ups and downs. I think the people that are interested in digital assets are going to continue to be interested in digital assets,\" she said. \"When it's a down market, that's when you go shopping.\""

        "content": "In this article, we will examine the 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites. If you want to skip the detailed analysis, visit 5 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\nIn today's technologically advanced world, people have come beyond physical assets and currencies in dealing with transactions. That's where cryptocurrency comes in, giving users a convenient way to buy and sell products and services through e-money. However, it's important to be vigilant and conduct due diligence before selecting a cryptocurrency investment platform or site in terms of its reputation, authenticity, current status, and credibility. This article will give useful insight to Bitcoin investors about 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nCryptocurrencies remained popular in 2021, especially Bitcoin (BTC). Goldman Sachs started dealing with transactions in cryptocurrencies. In April 2021, Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) was among the first crypto exchange platform to go public at a valuation of approx. $100 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shook hands with Coinbase in October 2022 to create feasibility for its cloud computing clients to deal transactions in e-money. Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also began accepting BTC as payments from users since 2014.\n\nThe most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, had a successful year, according to CNBC. Since 2021, the worth of the e-currency has risen by about 70%, driving the total market worth of crypto above $2 trillion. However, 2022 happened to be unfavorable for most cryptocurrency holders. Throughout 2022, Bitcoin lost 65% of its market share. A series of bad events, comprising the collapse of FTX (one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges), the crash of Terra Luna, and the predicted unfavorable macroeconomic situations, took crypto devotees by surprise.\n\nThe Big Crash\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve began to boost interest rates to combat excessive inflation, the price of cryptocurrencies fell much like almost everything else in the financial sector. That surprised many of Bitcoin's most ardent supporters, many of whom thought the digital money would act like gold does: as a hedge against inflation. In contrast to their predictions, the price of Bitcoin was dropping at the time of rapid inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main cause of the crypto market's slump was the failure of FTX. In addition to causing a significant market sell-off, FTX's bankruptcy and dispute with Binance have decreased liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. Individual investors, particularly those who purchased digital assets close to the highs, have suffered. However, structural issues in the sector have been highlighted, according to Lee Reiners (an expert in cryptocurrency law and policy):\n\n\u201cIt really exposed a number of crypto firms who were, you know, overextended, had poor risk management, or otherwise were engaging in fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nIs the Forecast Optimistic or Pessimistic?\n\nFor the majority of cryptocurrencies, 2023 has begun on a clean and favorable note. Some investors have turned to Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies for safety as inflation has slowed down, the recession is becoming more imminent, and the U.S. financial crisis is still raging.\n\nAccording to Analytics Insight, some market analysts believe Bitcoin will reach a price of $100,000 by the end of 2023. Others claim that Bitcoin won't rise over $70,000.\n\nBitcoin traded in a constrained price range from $26,000 to $28,600 from halfway through March to mid-April. On April 10, Bitcoin saw a breakout to the upside, reaching a high of $31,005 on the back of favorable inflation statistics that suggested the Fed may decide to hold off on interest rate rises in favor of rate cuts sooner than previously anticipated. Bitcoin has increased by 80% this year compared to last. Although Bitcoin is still approximately 50% below its all-time high, which was over $69,000 in November 2021, the path to recovery is still lengthy.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin will experience a halving event in 2024 is another factor supporting analysts' positive outlook on the cryptocurrency. Every four years, there is a Bitcoin halving event in which the currency's miner payouts are cut in half. Given that halving serves to reduce supply, this occurrence is widely seen as being favorable for Bitcoin's price. In the past, halving has been viewed as a highly positive indicator for boosting Bitcoin's price.\n\n12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites, the main factor on which we based our list is the 'score\u2019 from 0.0 to 10.0 extracted from Coinmarketcap as of the writing of this article. The score reflects average liquidity and investors' confidence, among other factors, on the crypto exchange platforms. We have also mentioned the platforms' trading volume (keeping in mind that trading volume fluctuates at any given time).\n\nSo, without further delay, let's head toward 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\n12. Huobi\n\nScore: 6.5\n\nTrading Volume: $298,644,218\n\nHuobi is one of the most trusted platforms for bitcoin trade, but the platform alos has its own coin. The native cryptocurrency of Huobi Global exchange is called Huobi Token (HT). Huobi users received Huobi Token in 2018 as part of a unique giveaway program that gave tokens out for free to platform users.\n\n11. Gemini\n\nScore: 6.6\n\nTrading Volume: $8,048,955\n\nAlthough Gemini supports fewer cryptocurrencies (including BTC), it places a strong emphasis on the security and compliance of the funds that its consumers invest with it. Despite having fewer assets, this platform is still a great choice for both new and seasoned traders due to its strong security emphasis and selection of tools and products.\n\nGemini has become the first SOC 2-certified cryptocurrency exchange in the market, demonstrating its dedication to security. The SOC 2 evaluation gauges a company's or product's levels of compliance and safety and is conducted by outside auditors.\n\n10. Gate.io\n\nScore: 6.6\n\nTrading Volume: $322,173,059\n\nAn investor can trade BTC on Gate.io for a maximum trading cost of 0.2%. Customers can decrease this charge in a number of ways, including by using the utility token of Gate.io. While not the cheapest on the market, this cost is also not the most expensive either.\n\n9. LBank\n\nScore: 6.6\n\nTrading Volume: $573,256,808\n\nLBank offers a web-based trading platform that is unique in many ways. The site also includes a number of sophisticated tools and features, including the technical analysis indicators RSI, KDJ, MACD, and CCI. The exchange platform also includes a volume window below the order windows and a market depth window below the chart. All of the attributes are displayed in an intuitive way.\n\n8. Bitfinex\n\nScore: 7.0\n\nTrading Volume: $28,683,171\n\nBitfinex, which was established in 2012, has comparatively cheap trading costs, with the majority of trade deals costing just 0.20% or less. Their trading interface is easy to use, and seasoned traders will value the capabilities and possibilities it provides. To test one\u2019s approach before investing real capital, an individual may start with a free paper trading account that provides them access to the Bitfinex platform and handles their money with convenience (this is akin to a stock market game).\n\n7. Bybit\n\nScore: 7.0\n\nTrading Volume: $217,986,015\n\nInvestors on Bybit can leverage their funds 100 times for Bitcoin and 50 times for other currencies. Additionally, users can also avail the option of purchasing temporary loss insurance. Both the site and the mobile app have attractive features for its loyal investors. Bybit provides traders with the Market Maker Incentive Program, which gives a maker fee reimbursement of up to 0.015%.\n\n6. Bitstamp\n\nScore: 7.1\n\nTrading Volume: $32,635,496\n\nDue to the presence of a small selection of currencies, Bitstamp is perhaps better suited for freshies and casual traders. Bitstamp Tradeview, Bitstamp.net, and Bitstamp Mobile are the three platforms that traders may utilize to trade. On all platforms, trading fees are the same. For users with less than $10,000 in trading activity over the last 30 days, the maximum trading cost on Bitstamp is merely 0.50%. Investors who trade larger sums each month would see a significant reduction in fees, which is on par with, or cheaper than what other well-known crypto exchanges charge.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Trusted Bitcoin Investment Sites.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Trusted Bitcoin Investment Sites is originally published on Insider Monkey."

        "title": "Memecoins and NFTs erupt on Bitcoin blockchain, leading to \u2018seismic shift\u2019 for miners - Fortune",
        "content": "An eruption of memecoins and nonfungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain has reshaped the revenue profile of miners and stirred questions about how lasting the upheaval will prove to be.\n\nNew software known as Ordinals paved the way for the NFTs and meme tokens to come to the network this year. Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. says the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem could be worth $4.5 billion by 2025, while about 25,000 memecoins have been tallied on the blockchain since they first emerged in March.\n\nThe NFT and meme-token craze spurred record transactions and an ensuing fee windfall for miners, who run the computers underpinning Bitcoin. At one point in May, transaction fees made up over 40% of revenues, whereas miner income is usually dominated by the new Bitcoin they get for securing the blockchain.\n\n\u201cThe Ordinals protocol has stimulated a seismic shift in the Bitcoin mining landscape,\u201d said Jihan Wu, chairman of Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group, one of the top crypto miners by computer power.\n\nOrdinals and a crypto rebound have eased the pressure on mining margins caused by last year\u2019s digital-asset rout and high energy costs. But Bitcoin purists argue the Ordinals phenomenon clogs the network and interferes with the largest cryptocurrency\u2019s store-of-value and payments functions.\n\nThe mean fee per transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain began April at $2.80, reached $30 on May 8 and moderated to $6 on May 18, CryptoQuant data show. Total fee income attributable to Ordinals stands at about $37.4 million, according to data compiled by Dune Analytics AS.\n\nDeveloper Casey Rodarmor created Ordinals, a software protocol that lets users inscribe digital content like videos, images and text on satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. There are 100 million satoshis in one Bitcoin.\n\nRodarmor\u2019s innovation then allowed a pseudonymous blockchain analyst called Domo to develop the Bitcoin Request for Comment \u2014 or BRC-20 \u2014 standard, which led to the explosion of memecoins.\n\nThe durability of the sudden ardor for NFTs, or digital collectibles, and speculative tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain remains an open question. The market value of the memecoins was heading toward $1 billion earlier in May but has since declined to about $582 million, figures from BRC-20.io show.\n\nThe BRC-20 tokens have no utility, said Carlos Gonzalez Campo, a research analyst at crypto exchange-traded product provider 21Shares AG.\n\nThe fundamental takeaway may be that Ordinals has created a pathway to uses of the Bitcoin network that didn\u2019t exist before.\n\n\u201cWhile the memecoin frenzy on Bitcoin will likely subside eventually, valuable use cases will emerge from the chaos, such as utilizing Bitcoin as a data availability layer and storing crucial documents that require permanent preservation,\u201d said Sami Kassab, a research analyst at Messari.\n\nShares Rally\n\nA sustained boost to transaction income could help sustain the Bitcoin network longer term by keeping miners engaged. Transactions will be the sole revenue source by about 2140, when Bitcoin is due to hit its cap of 21 million tokens and new coins will no longer be issued in return for securing the blockchain.\n\nFor now, Ordinals is helping to fuel renewed investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin miners. The 20-member MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index is up 110% so far in 2023, outstripping Bitcoin\u2019s 74% advance.\n\nThe application of ordinals is \u201ccompletely rewriting how people think about mining profitability,\u201d said Colin Harper, head of content and research at crypto-mining services provider Luxor Technologies."

        "content": "The revelation came a few months into her divorce proceedings\n\nWith financial infidelity on the rise, many people are now hiding their wealth in crypto wallets, away from the prying eyes of their spouses. In one such recent case, a woman in New York discovered that her husband had stored 12 bitcoins worth $500,000 in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet, CNBC reported. The revelation came a few months into her divorce proceedings.\n\nThe woman identified as Sarita, became suspicious because her husband, who earned some $3 million a year, wasn't disclosing many assets in the divorce case. She then enlisted the help of a forensic accountant who tracked down his cryptocurrency investment using analysis of blockchain transactions to trace hidden assets.\n\n''I know of Bitcoin and things like that. I just didn't know much about it. It was never even a thought in my mind, because it's not like we were discussing it or making investments together. ... It was definitely a shock,'' Sarita said.\n\nDivorce attorneys told the outlet it is becoming common for people to hide crypto from their partners. Lamenting the growing trend, they noted that the law is struggling to keep up with digital assets that largely exist outside the reach of centralised intermediaries such as banks.\n\nAttorneys in Florida, Texas, New York, and California told CNBC that crypto now plays a role in roughly 20% to 50% of divorces they handle since it has become a more popular investment in recent years.\n\n''The thing with cryptocurrency is it's not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can't subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody's cryptocurrency holdings,'' divorce attorney Kelly Burris told CNBC. She added it is easy to hide cryptocurrency assets if one spouse is tech-savvy and the other is not.\n\nAccording to an NBC News poll, 1 in 5 Americans have invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrency, with men between the ages of 18 and 49 accounting for the highest share of all demographic groups."

        "title": "El Salvador: Bitcoin Nation or Failed Experiment? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender was polarizing. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts celebrated the shift as a critical step toward mass adoption, while economists trashed the idea and mourned for the Salvadoran people.\n\nSince becoming the first country in the world to officially adopt Bitcoin, the Salvadoran Government is more committed than ever to its blockchain-based future. Regardless of volatility in the crypto market, president Nayib Bukele\u2019s resolve remains unswayed.\n\nEven after the collapse of FTX, when digital currency looked to be finished forever (again), the Bukele government doubled down and announced they\u2019d buy one bitcoin daily. Despite the government\u2019s confidence, the Salvadoran public\u2019s usage and adoption of Bitcoin remains low.\n\nWith the construction of Bitcoin City lagging and the price of Bitcoin still far from all-time highs, is time running out for Nayib Bukele\u2019s vision?\n\nLegal Tender Pioneers\n\nAfter proposing the bill on June 5th at the Bitcoin Conference in Miami, El Salvador officially adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender on September 7, 2021. At the time, BTC was trading at around $50,000, and market sentiment had never been higher.\n\nLong before the Bitcoin Law came into effect, pockets of El Salvadoran society had been using the digital asset as a currency of exchange. The local economy of El Zonte, a coastal fishing village, had been transacting in BTC for years.\n\nEven during his tenure as the Mayor of San Salvador, the nation\u2019s capital, Nayib Bukele, had expressed an interest in the national adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nWhile many businesses accepted Bitcoin before the announcement, its status as legal tender means that operators must accept BTC as payment.\n\nWhy Did President Nayib Bukele Adopt Bitcoin?\n\nIn many respects, the Central American nation is a perfect example of why Bitcoin was created in the first place. According to Nayib Bukele, 70% of the El Salvadoran people don\u2019t have a bank account and live and work in an informal economy.\n\nHowever, mobile internet usage in the country is widespread, with over 9.94 million active mobile connections in early 2023. This figure represents around 156% of the total population and indicates that a mobile-first financial service, like a Bitcoin wallet, would be far more accessible than traditional central banks.\n\nAround 25% of El Salvador\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) comes from remittance payments. This means that a significant portion of wealth within the country comes in from overseas payments. Remittance fees are typically high, sometimes costing around 30-50% of the value of the transfer.\n\nLike many Central American nations, El Salvador uses the US Dollar as its national currency. In 2001, the El Salvadoran government began de-circulating their previous currency, the Salvadoran col\u00f3n, replacing it with USD as the more stable and secure national currency.\n\nTwenty years later, the Salvadoran government wanted to move away from its reliance on the US dollar and its loss of value due to inflation.\n\nWhat Are the Risks of Using Bitcoin as a Legal Tender?\n\nUsing Bitcoin as a legal tender has raised many concerns among the Salvadoran public. There are concerns that the cryptocurrency network will be used for scams and money laundering. The Salvadoran government argues Bitcoin has the opposite effect; blockchain\u2019s transparency means that tracking funds is easier than ever.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has implored El Salvador to reverse its decision about using Bitcoin as a legal tender. They argue that the cryptocurrency is too volatile and poses a risk to the nation\u2019s financial stability and consumer protection.\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin drops significantly, there is a substantial risk that the El Salvadoran government will default on its loans and be unable to repay its lenders.\n\nBitcoin City\n\nWith the vision of turning El Salvador into a cryptocurrency utopia, Nayib Bukele has promised to build Bitcoin City on the side of a volcano. The proposed city is expected to be built on the Gulf of Fonseca on the nation\u2019s southern coast.\n\nGeothermic energy harnessed from the Conchagua volcano will be used to operate Bitcoin mining operations. Additionally, Bukele envisions a digital asset tax haven with no income or capital gains tax. This is expected to attract wealth and investment to El Salvador.\n\nTo fund the construction of Bitcoin City, the Salvadoran government will begin the issuance of Bitcoin Bonds. The first ten-year issue is known as the \u2018Volcano Bond\u2019 and is estimated to be worth around $1B. Half of the funds raised are invested in Bitcoin, with the rest being put towards the development of Bitcoin City.\n\nHas El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Bet Paid Off?\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, El Salvador\u2019s BTC holdings are still at a loss. According to Bloomberg, El Salvador holds approximately 2,546 BTC acquired at a cost basis of around $108 million. For these holdings to break even, the price of one bitcoin must be $42,419.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it\u2019s hard to gauge the success of Bukele\u2019s move. As an incentive during the initial rollout, the Salvadoran government gifted every citizen $30 in BTC. Everyone who downloaded the Chivo wallet, El Salvador\u2019s national wallet, was eligible. However, according to Reuters, usage rates indicate that just 20% of users have continued using the app since claiming the sign-up bonus.\n\nA recent study by the University of Central America found that 77% of respondents believed Bukele\u2019s Bitcoin experiment failed. Perceived security seems a significant roadblock, with many citizens not understanding and trusting Bitcoin.\n\nDespite negative sentiment from the population, Nayib Bukele remains committed to the future. The latest news out of the country suggests that the Salvadoran government has paid off over $800 million in debts.\n\nBukele was happy to call out the hundreds of mainstream media articles suggesting he would default on the loan.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s still too early to say whether the adoption of Bitcoin has been a successful endeavor for the nation. The verdict will likely be directly correlated to Bitcoin price as opposed to its effectiveness as a network.\n\nBitcoin Legal Tender: Who\u2019s Next?\n\nWhile El Salvador is leading the charge regarding Bitcoin adoption, it\u2019s not the only nation with its eyes on the digital horizon. Other Latin American countries like Paraguay and Panama have shown an interest in Bitcoin and have progressive laws around mining and taxation.\n\nWhen Paraguay proposed a bill to make Bitcoin a legal tender in June 2021, things looked positive for Paraguayan crypto enthusiasts. The South American country has a reputation as a top destination for Bitcoin mining.\n\nConversely, Panama has passed a bill that aims to make the nation more crypto-friendly. While Bitcoin is not yet legal tender, profits from cryptocurrency-related endeavors are not subject to capital gains tax.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is far from perfect. Even with upgrades like the Lightning Network, it\u2019s still comparatively slow and expensive. Recent gas spikes from Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens have congested the network and driven transaction fees to all-time highs, proving that Bitcoin still has some scalability issues.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile Bitcoin being recognized as a legal tender is undoubtedly a step toward mass adoption, El Salvador\u2019s experiment will have huge ramifications on how the digital asset is perceived. If Bitcoin\u2019s price drops and El Salvador becomes insolvent, it is doubtful that another country would want to adopt BTC.\n\nFAQs"

The civil rights activist and lawyer also announced that he would accept Bitcoin donations for his campaign, thereby becoming the first presidential candidate to greenlight the reception of crypto for a run to the Oval Office.\n\nKennedy noted that he first realized the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s ability to circumvent government intervention after he witnessed Canada\u2019s handling of the trucker protests last year. In his eyes, the protests were peaceful without violating any laws, yet protesters couldn\u2019t access their money and bank accounts in order to support their families.\n\nKennedy\u2019s 5 Pro-crypto Promises\n\nIn what he deemed as a \u201cdevastating use of government repression,\u201d Kennedy said he saw for the first time how free money was equal in importance to free speech, and made a few key promises to the crypto space, saying he would:\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Defend the right to self-custody Bitcoin and other digital assets in the US\n\n2. Uphold the right to run a node at home\n\n3. Defend use-agnostic and industry-neutral regulation of energy\n\n4. Make sure that the US remains the global hub of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and reverse the government\u2019s growing hostility toward the industry\n\n5. Review whether individuals like Ross Ulbricht were prosecuted \u201cfor actual crimes, or as a means to crackdown on crypto.\u201d In the case of the latter, he would consider swiftly pardoning them.\n\nOn Bitcoin Mining and AI\n\nKennedy also took a shot at incumbent president Biden and his 30% energy tax on Bitcoin mining:\n\n\u201cPresident Biden's 30% tax on energy for Bitcoin miners requires an invasive surveillance apparatus to monitor what is happening in individual computers. It sets a terrible precedent in which everything that you do requires electricity and must now be monitored by the government. That's why I also support people's rights to refuse smart meters in their homes.\u201d\n\nWhile he stated that he doesn\u2019t own any Bitcoin, Kennedy underscored its importance in a world of new threats to democracy such as increasing governmental interference:\n\n\u201c...we are now living in this age of turnkey totalitarianism with this emerging technology, which can empower totalitarian regimes. And our job is to try to build and fortify democratic institutions at the same rate as totalitarian instruments are being expanded in their power.\u201d\n\nKennedy also touched on the malicious use of artificial intelligence:\n\n\u201cFor things like AI which really are going to threaten democracy at its base, we need to not be chipping away at our democratic institutions. We need to fortify the ones that exist and build new ones and the biggest most important one on the horizon is Bitcoin because it can't be manipulated.\u201d\n\nGabbard Takes Aim at Democrats and CBDCs\n\nTulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Hawaii, came out eloquently against the direction of her party as well as the implementation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nShe said she related to Kennedy\u2019s speech earlier, as she knew a little bit of something about this:\n\n\u201cThey make an example of those of us who dare to speak the truth and call out what is common sense and obvious to the rest of us about their hidden insanity and hypocrisy. Hoping that by making an example of us, they will then cause the rest of us to self-censor ourselves to fall in line and to comply.\u201d\n\nThe ex-congresswoman aired her dissatisfaction with the current state of the Democratic Party and its leadership, arguing that the party has become elitist and intolerant of dissent, seeking power at any cost.\n\nShe criticized the mainstream media, big tech, and the national security state for working together to silence those who challenge the party's narrative.\n\nGabbard also highlighted the weaponization of federal agencies and law enforcement against political opponents, as revealed in the Durham report. She also expresses concerns about the Biden administration's push for a CBDC, seeing it as a threat to privacy and economic autonomy.\n\nThe presidential hopeful warned that the current \u201cpower holders prioritize control over people's lives and suppress freedom of speech\u201d and emphasized the importance of active citizenship and defending freedoms to counteract this oppression. Gabbard concluded her keynote by urging people to protect democracy and preserve the vision of the country's founders.\n\nBitcoin 2023 Pulls in Pro-Crypto Politicians\n\nBitcoin Miami 2023 played host to a string of prominent pro-crypto political speakers such as Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a venture capitalist and \u201canti-woke\u201d activist, Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis, Governor Ridwan Kamil from West Java, Indonesia; North Carolina congressman Patrick McHenry, who last month memorably grilled SEC chair Gary Gensler in Congress; Congressman Byron Donalds, representing Florida; and David McIntosh, a former Congressman and White House Senior Staff member.\n\nOrganizers BTC Media previously said that the flagship global Bitcoin conference aims to provide a platform for the discussion of diverse perspectives and ideas. By engaging politicians open to Bitcoin and deepening their understanding of the cryptocurrency, the conference seeks to foster support for the industry in Washington and beyond."

        "content": "As the hype around Bitcoin (BTC) has faded, institutional investors and portfolio managers have begun looking at the major cryptocurrency as a \u201cserious venue\u201d to invest in, claims Fred Pye, CEO of 3iQ, Canada\u2019s first Bitcoin fund issuer.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph during the Bitcoin 2023, Pye spoke about how Canada\u2019s advanced crypto trading regulation has drawn investors to the digital assets market.\n\nAccording to Pye, fund managers and institutional investors running diversified portfolio assets seek alternative investment strategies amid a global inflationary environment and macroeconomic challenges.\n\n\u201cThe FOMO in Bitcoin is gone; it\u2019s all moved over to AI [artificial intelligence]. So now the institutions and the proper portfolio managers \u2014 the people that are responsible for running diversified portfolios \u2014 are now starting to take a look at Bitcoin as a serious venue.\u201c\n\nIt is not just about maximizing profits, says Pye. For institutional investors, crypto use cases will be a growing trend in the next few years. \u201cThe theme for 2024 going forward is definitely use cases. So, we\u2019ve got this beautiful technology, now let\u2019s put that beautiful technology to work,\u201d he stated.\n\nRegulatory challenges for institutional adoption are nothing new, but Canada has taken the lead in launching crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s relatively negative stance toward crypto.\n\nRelated: Crypto adoption is booming, but not in the US or Europe \u2014 Bitcoin Builders 2023\n\nAn ETF is a portfolio of assets with shares traded on a stock market. It blends the characteristics and potential benefits of mutual funds, stocks and bonds.\n\nCanadian regulators have approved several crypto ETFs recently, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) products from 3iQ, Purpose Investments and Evolve Funds Group, attracting millions of dollars to the crypto products.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never been mispriced,\u201d said Pye about running regulated digital assets ETFs in Canada, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s no difference about running a Bitcoin ETF than running a gold ETF. We track the price of Bitcoin identically. They\u2019re low fees, and it works. [...] We can cipher trace where the Bitcoin comes from, so we\u2019re only purchasing clean Bitcoin. And I think these are all the characteristics that people are concerned about.\u201c\n\nCanada\u2019s latest initiative toward digital assets relies on public consultation about a central bank digital currency, with the local monetary authority asking what features the country\u2019s citizens want in a potential digital Canadian dollar. Canadians\u2019 consultation results are expected to be published later this year.\n\nMagazine: Best and worst countries for crypto taxes \u2014 Plus crypto tax tips"

        "content": "Inexperienced traders usually chase prices higher during the end of the bull phase as they fear missing out on the rally. However, institutional investors tend to wait for the froth to settle before entering. Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) bear market in 2022 ended the hype that was seen in 2021.\n\nFred Pye, CEO of 3iQ, Canada\u2019s first Bitcoin fund issuer, said in an interview with Cointelegraph that as \u201cthe FOMO in Bitcoin is gone\u201d institutional investors and portfolio managers have started to take a look at it as \u201ca serious venue.\u201d\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nWhile analysts are bullish for the long term, the short-term picture looks uncertain as the price is stuck inside a range for the past several days. Analysts expect a trending move to start either next week or the week after.\n\nIf Bitcoin breaks out to the upside, what are the altcoins that may follow it higher? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may rally in the short term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading near the support line of the symmetrical triangle but the bulls have failed to push the price above it. This indicates that the bears are active at higher levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($27,481) and the relative strength index below 42 indicate that bears are at an advantage.\n\nIf the sellers sink the price below the immediate support at $26,361, the BTC/USDT pair may tumble to the crucial support zone between $25,800 and $25,250. Buyers are expected to protect this zone with all their might because if they fail, the pair could nosedive to $20,000.\n\nConversely, if bulls kick the price above the 20-day EMA, it may attract further buying. The pair could then rise toward the resistance line of the triangle. If this barrier is overcome, the pair may start its journey to $32,400.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating uncertainty among the bulls and the bears. The flattening moving averages also point to a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the price collapses below the triangle, the short-term trend will turn negative and the pair could drop to $25,800. The pattern target of the triangle is $24,773.\n\nThis bearish view will be negated if the price surges above the triangle. The pair could then climb to $28,400 and thereafter to the pattern target of $29,165.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nXRP (XRP) is trying to start a recovery. Buyers have been sustaining the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.45) since May 16 but they haven\u2019t been able to overcome the obstacle at the 50-day SMA ($0.47).\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating that bulls have a slight advantage. That increases the likelihood of a rally above the 50-day SMA. The XRP/USDT pair could then start a rally to $0.54 and eventually to $0.58. This zone is likely to witness aggressive selling by the bears.\n\nThe first support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA. Sellers will have to yank the price below this level to gain the upper hand. The pair may then descend to $0.43 and later to the crucial support at $0.40.\n\nXRP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the recovery reversed direction from the downtrend line. This shows that the bears are fiercely guarding the downtrend line. Sellers are trying to maintain the price below the 20-EMA and stretch the pullback to the 50-SMA.\n\nInstead, if the price turns up from the current level and climbs above the downtrend line, it will suggest the start of a short-term up-move. There is a minor resistance at $0.48 but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then rally to $0.54.\n\nLitecoin price analysis\n\nLitecoin (LTC) has been trading in a tight range between the 50-day SMA ($89) and the overhead resistance of $96 for the past few days. This shows indecision between the bulls and the bears.\n\nLTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($88) has turned up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the bulls have the edge. This enhances the prospects of a rally above the resistance at $96. If that happens, the LTC/USDT pair could rally to $106. This level may again attract strong selling by the bears.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the pair may remain stuck between $79 and $96 for some more time.\n\nLTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to defend the 20-EMA. This indicates a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. If the price bounces off the current level, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle at $96.\n\nHowever, the bears are not going to give up without a fight. They are trying to sink the price below the 20-EMA. If they are successful, the pair may crumble to the 50-SMA. A collapse of this support may open the doors for a fall to $86 and then $82.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin, Ethereum bears are back in control \u2014 Two derivative metrics suggest\n\nRender Token price analysis\n\nRender Token (RNDR) is in an uptrend. Buyers kicked the price above the overhead resistance of $2.60 on May 21 but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels.\n\nRNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the RSI just below the overbought area indicate that bulls are in command. Buyers will make another attempt to propel the price above the psychological barrier at $3. If they manage to do that, the RNDR/USDT pair may rally to $3.35.\n\nThe first support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($2.10). If this level gives way, it will suggest that the break above $2.60 may have been a bull trap. The pair could then plunge to the 50-day SMA ($1.87).\n\nRNDR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls are struggling to sustain the price above the overhead resistance at $2.60, pointing toward the possibility of a bull trap. Sellers will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the immediate support at the 20-EMA. If they do that, the pair may decline to the 50-SMA.\n\nHowever, the rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that lower levels are likely to be purchased. If buyers push and maintain the price above $2.60, the pair could soar to $3.\n\nConflux price analysis\n\nConflux (CFX) is trading inside a descending channel pattern. The bulls purchased the dip to the support line on May 12, indicating solid demand at lower levels.\n\nCFX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($0.29) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting that the selling pressure has reduced.\n\nBuyers tried to clear the overhead hurdle at the 50-day SMA ($0.32) on May 16 but the bears held their ground. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to dip back below the 20-day EMA. This signals buying on dips.\n\nThe bulls are likely to make one more attempt to propel the price above the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, the CFX/USDT pair may reach the downtrend line, which is again likely to act as a formidable resistance.\n\nCFX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is correcting the sharp rally from $0.22 to $0.33. Buyers are trying to defend the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.29, which is a positive sign.\n\nIf buyers sustain the price above the resistance line, it will suggest that bulls are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may first rise to $0.33 and thereafter to $0.37. Alternatively, a break and close below $0.29 could start a deeper correction toward $0.28 and then 0.27.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSpeaking to a packed audience on the final day of the 2023 Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Fla., Democratic presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. decisively built Bitcoin into his campaign platform, saying the cryptocurrency must be defended against what he called \"invasive surveillance.\"\n\n\"We live in a time now that technology has dangerously expanded the capacity for governments and corporations to control our lives,\" Kennedy said. \"Distant, impersonal multinationals and authoritarian technologies have usurped realms of human activity that were once private or held by the community.\"\n\nKennedy added that these technologies monitor movements, communications, and transactions, pointing to the trucker protest in Ottawa, Canada, in 2022 as an example.\n\nHe said Bitcoin won him over when he witnessed the Canadian administration using surveillance and data tracking systems to block truckers who were protesting COVID mandates from accessing their bank accounts in a bid to end the demonstration.\n\n\"When I witnessed this cataclysm, this devastating use of government repression, I realized for the first time how free money is as important to freedom as free expression,\" Kennedy said.\n\nDuring his keynote address, Kennedy took aim at President Joe Biden's proposed 30% tax on energy use for Bitcoin miners saying it would require an invasive surveillance apparatus to monitor miner energy usage.\n\nInitially introduced in the White House\u2019s 2024 budget, the Biden Administration called for a 30% crypto mining tax, saying that crypto mining consumed almost as much energy, 50,000 gigawatts of electricity, as televisions and home computers in 2022.\n\nThe energy consumed by mining cryptocurrency has long been a cudgel used against proof-of-work blockchains. Proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin consume significant energy due to the computational power required to solve the complex mathematical problems involved in mining.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"It sets a terrible precedent in which everything that you do that requires electricity must now be monitored by the government,\" Kennedy said, adding that he would support people\u2019s right to refuse smart meters in their homes.\n\nKennedy had already stepped into the digital currency arena after opposing a U.S. central bank digital currency, or CBDC, and saying the U.S. government was waging a \"war on crypto.\"\n\n\"As President,\" Kennedy told the audience. \"I will make sure that your right to hold and use Bitcoin is inviolable, [and] I will defend the right of self-custody.\"\n\nNot only would Kennedy protect the right to hold Bitcoin, he assured the crowd, he also pledged to uphold the right to run a private node\u2014saying that Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements should be applied at the level of banks and exchanges, not at the level of nodes.\n\n\"I don't think the government has the right to demand access to your Bitcoin key or indeed any of your passwords,\" Kennedy said. \"To say otherwise is to cede essential territory to the surveillance state.\"\n\n\"The whole point of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized,\" Kennedy said. \"Anyone can run a node, and it's important not only for Bitcoin but for democracy to be decentralized.\""

According to two derivatives metrics, crypto bulls will have a hard time to break the downtrend, even though analyzing a shorter timeframe provides a neutral view, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and BNB, on average, gaining 0.3% between May 12 and May 19.\n\nTotal crypto market cap in USD, 12-hour.

In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has been below 1.0 for the past couple of weeks, indicating a higher preference for neutral-to-bullish call options.

        "title": "Here's how to use DeFi on Bitcoin without 'polluting' the blockchain - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is known for its immutability and the hard-coded rules that make the system secure but slow to modernize. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 the underlying network that empowers the original cryptocurrency \u2014 is closed to innovation and development. Even though the initial efforts to introduce decentralized finance (DeFi) to Bitcoin such as cross-chain bridges and wrapped tokens resulted in a massive wave of hacks and exploits in the DeFi space, developers continue to look for new and more reliable ways to tap into the unmatched liquidity of the BTC pool.\n\nLaunched in November 2021, the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade was an important step in adding extra functionality to the base layer of Bitcoin. Among other benefits, including cheaper and more efficient transactions, the Taproot upgrade also introduced rudimentary smart contracts \u2014 the backbone of DeFi \u2014 to Bitcoin for the first time.\n\nThe Taproot upgrade adds rudimentary smart contracts to the Bitcoin network. Source: Chaindebrief\n\nBitcoin DeFi: The first attempt\n\nSmart contracts are automated agreements between multiple parties that are stored on a blockchain. They enable a wide range of DeFi functionality. The introduction of smart contracts to the Bitcoin base layer hinted at the possibility of common DeFi trends such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs) appearing on the Bitcoin network, and developers rushed to work on it.\n\nShortly thereafter, Bitcoiners came up with their version of NFTs with the Ordinals protocol, sparking a hot debate about adding more usability to the Bitcoin base layer versus \u201ccongesting\u201d it with nonessential content. Ordinals, also known as Bitcoin NFTs, allow users to inscribe digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain. Launched in January 2023, ordinals quickly became a popular way to interact with the base layer, surpassing over 3 million inscriptions.\n\nThe total number of ordinals exceeded 3 million on May 1. Source: Dune\n\n\u200b\u200bFollowing the launch of ordinals, BRC-20 tokens emerged as an experimental token standard based on the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC) protocol. These tokens represented fungible assets on a 1:1 basis. However, the influx of memecoins such as Pepecoin (PEPE) on the BRC-20 standard led to a congestion problem, resulting in a backlog of 500,000 transactions awaiting settlement. This surge in demand caused transaction fees to skyrocket to $30 per transaction, significantly impacting the efficiency of the entire Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin DeFi: The second attempt\n\nTo make NFTs more efficient on Bitcoin, a new protocol called Bitcoin Stamps, or \u201cSecure Tradeable Art Maintained Securely,\u201d was launched shortly after the ordinals. And unlike the ordinals, Bitcoin stamps allow the minting or embedding of image data into the Bitcoin network by storing image data across multiple unspent transaction outputs to increase decentralization and immutability.\n\nAlthough the second attempt to add NFT usability to the Bitcoin network is widely considered an improvement over ordinals, Bitcoin stamps are far from providing ideal results. The protocol requires a canvas size of 24 by 24 pixels, which limits the possibilities to pixel-art NFTs.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue of \u201cpolluting\u201d the Bitcoin blockchain by storing data directly on the base layer remains unsolved. Moreover, a controversial topic still hovers over the Bitcoin community: Do we need NFTs on the main Bitcoin chain?\n\nAdditionally, just as BRC-20 spawned from ordinals, stamps formed their own tokenization standard called SRC-20. However, while SRC-20 tokens have greater immutability, they take up even more block space than BRC-20 tokens, and if their popularity would grow, it would further congest the Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin DeFi using Layer 2\n\nAn alternative approach aims to solve all the shortcomings of layer-1 (i.e. Bitcoin), DeFi by moving NFT and tokens to layer 2 thus decongesting Bitcoin, lowering fees, and adding additional use cases. Like the Lightning Network solved many aspects of Bitcoin payments as a layer-2 solution, NFTs and tokens can also be moved to the second layer to keep the Bitcoin base layer clean and efficient. This reduces the need for all transactions to use Bitcoin for settlement.\n\nMintlayer, a layer-2 solution that builds the tools to enable DeFi on Bitcoin, aims to open Bitcoin to NFTs along with smart contracts, atomic swaps, and decentralized applications (DApps). Using a layer-2 network directly on Bitcoin enables lower minting and transfer costs while adding smart contract features and reducing congestion on the base layer.\n\nInstead of trying to get DeFi onto the Bitcoin network through unreliable gateways such as cross-chain bridges and wrapped tokens, Mintlayer enables direct swaps of native Bitcoin for other tokenized assets minted directly on Mintlayer, eliminating all intermediaries between Bitcoin and DeFi.\n\nTo tokenize assets with tailored protocols designed for specific use cases, Mintlayer has introduced three tokenization standards. The MLS-01 is created for securities, stablecoins, and stock tokens to function on Bitcoin, while the MLS-02 is designed for confidential transactions. The third one, MLS-03, is built for NFTs only. Since it\u2019s developed specifically with NFTs in mind, there\u2019s no need to write a smart contract \u2014 unlike ordinals and Stamps. MLS-03 also unlocks the limits introduced by layer-1 attempts by leveraging the freedom of layer-2.\n\n\"It\u2019s exciting to see innovation on the Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d said Enrico Rubboli, CEO of Mintlayer, adding, \u201cBut, ultimately, NFTs and tokens need to be on layer 2. There are many constraints for NFTs and tokens in terms of size, smart contract capabilities, and immutability that Mintlayer won\u2019t be subject to.\u201d\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin allows the sustainable and efficient use of decentralized financial applications on the Bitcoin network. By offloading the complexity of DeFi to layer 2, Bitcoin users can now benefit from improved scalability, reduced transaction costs, and a wider range of financial services while still leveraging the security and robustness of the underlying Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLearn more about Mintlayer"

        "content": "A leaked document distributed to Democratic House Financial Services Committee members has revealed the \u201ckey messages\u201d legislators were advised to keep to, which might result in practically all cryptocurrencies being classified as securities.\n\nAs governments and regulatory agencies impose more robust controls on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors and enthusiasts are left worrying about the potential repercussions.\n\nOne fascinating issue arises: if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) tumbles, will meme currencies become more popular? Will DogeMiyagi ($MIYAGI) become the meme market leader?\n\nFurthermore, would cryptocurrencies in presale garner greater interest because they are untouched by the current market trend?\n\nThe Great Crypto Cliffhanger: Bitcoin\u2019s Precarious Position and Ethereum\u2019s Fate in the Balance\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price is perched precariously on a stable support level, making it a compelling opportunity for eager buyers to accumulate. After several failed attempts to break free and soar to new heights, BTC is back at the notorious $27,000 barrier, like a stubborn explorer refusing to surrender to the depths.\n\nOh, the drama! After seven days of relentless selling, Bitcoin\u2019s price has finally taken a break from the madness, settling down for a cosy consolidation around the familiar $27,000 support level. It\u2019s like the calm after a stormy affair, where BTC is catching its breath, unsure of its following path.\n\nWill it sweep Monday\u2019s low at $26,694, teasing us with a swift recovery and reclaiming its support level throne? Or will it succumb to the temptation of becoming a resistance barrier, shattering our bullish dreams and potentially triggering a merciless correction to $25,290 and $23,905 levels? The plot thickens.\n\nMeanwhile, our beloved Ethereum (ETH) has been busy cooking up some technical mischief. Picture this: a bearish divergence sells signal on the daily chart, unfolding its treacherous formation between January 14 and May 13, leaving unsuspecting investors in disbelief.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike a magician revealing their trickery, this wicked move sent ETH on a 17% freefall, leaving it gasping for air at the measly $1,735 mark. But fear not! Hope lies in the mystical realm of critical support floors, and ETH\u2019s saviour awaits at the sacred $1,705 level. If it can summon the strength to bounce back from this abyss, a glimmer of light might shine through, guiding it on a heroic journey towards the superb $2,028 destination.\n\nBut patience, dear investors, patience! Remember, the tale of Ethereum\u2019s fate is yet to be written, and it eagerly awaits Bitcoin\u2019s proclamation of direction. In this mesmerising world of cryptocurrencies, where fortunes rise and fall with the flicker of a digital heartbeat, one thing remains clear: the intricate dance of Bitcoin sets the stage for its companion, Ethereum.\n\nThe Rise of Meme Coins: Exploring the Allure and Potential of DogeMiyagi in the Crypto Market\n\nThe general public is drawn to meme coins because of the possibility of rapid returns and the entertaining and dynamic communities surrounding them. While meme currencies lack the technological complexity and use cases of Bitcoin and Ethereum, their popularity stems from their ease of usage, low cost, and viral growth potential. The current crackdown on mainstream cryptocurrencies may have created a void that meme coins might fill, luring buyers looking for new investment possibilities.\n\nThe presale of meme coins is another important factor in their success.\n\nDuring a market downturn, presale cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for investors. These new currencies are introduced through presales or initial coin offers (ICOs), which allow investors to purchase tokens before they are available on the general market. Because market trends do not yet influence presale coins, they enable investors to enter the market at an early stage.\n\nOverall, coins, let us welcome its highness DogeMiyagi to the meme market podium!\n\nMIYAGI is one of the most recent meme currencies, and it has the potential to become the market leader.\n\nThrough thorough audits, DogeMiyagi proudly emphasises its dedication to identity verification and risk assessment. Its commitment to maintaining a safe environment has won the prestigious Know Your Coin (KYC) accreditation, indicating its commitment to fostering community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi understands the importance of community involvement and aims to establish an environment that values and benefits all members. DogeMiyagi aspires to stand out in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies with its unique features, attention to security and compliance, and commitment to community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi"

During the Bitcoin 2023 conference held in Miami, Florida, Marathon said they will match donations to the non-profit Bitcoin research and development firm Brink, up to $500,000 on a two-for-one basis. Following the conference, Marathon will continue to match additional donations on a one-for-one basis until December 31. These contributions will be used to fund grants and programs that financially support Bitcoin Core developers, ensuring the continuous improvement of the world's dominant blockchain. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel emphasized the importance of compensating these developers, who often rely on grants to sustain their work, and expressed his desire to engage other industry partners in supporting this vital ecosystem.\n\nThe recent market downturn in the crypto industry, known as the \"crypto winter,\" had raised concerns about funding for Bitcoin development. However, Marathon's generous pledge, which may reach $1 million with third-party donations, demonstrates the company's commitment to bolstering the Bitcoin funding landscape. Thiel highlighted the reliance of developers on their personal resources and the necessity of grants, such as those provided by Brink, to ensure their financial stability. Brink, founded in 2020, supports Bitcoin protocol development through its fellowship mentor program and developer grant program. Thiel and Brink's co-founder and executive director, Mike Schmidt, jointly announced this initiative during the conference, garnering significant support."

It is a question that has been asked since it was discovered that Moner mining can be much easier and more rewarding than Bitcoin.\n\nAnd this week Monero (XMR) has tested the truth of that assumption. As it displayed relatively uncommon stability, does that mean that Monero will surpass Bitcoin?\n\nAnother question that people have been asking for a while is \u201cWhat is the next big thing in crypto?\u201d and we might be closer to the answers than we know. Big Eyes Coin (BIG) ends its presale on June 3rd and celebrates that by offering tokens at a vastly discounted price for the remainder of the presale.\n\nMonero Rises 0.47%: Is It Better Than Bitcoin?\n\nBig Eyes Coin About To Pounce On The Market\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Fluctuates\n\nMonero Rises 0.47%: Is it Better than Bitcoin?\n\nMonero (XMR) became famous for providing private transactions to its users, and for being easier to mine than Bitcoin or Ethereum. By using an algorithm that enables Monero mining on a relatively less-advantaged computer, it has prompted some to ask: is Monero better than Bitcoin?\n\nMonero\u2019s XMR has exhibited relatively low volatility compared to the overall cryptocurrency market. On Monday, it saw a modest increase of 0.47% to reach $153.8. InvestorsObserver assigns Monero a Volatility Rank of 14, indicating its low volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies. This places Monero in the bottom 14% of cryptos in terms of volatility.\n\nThe low volatility ranking suggests that Monero\u2019s price experiences narrower swings and is less susceptible to manipulation. Currently, Monero\u2019s price is trading near resistance levels, with support at around $152.44 and resistance at approximately $153.94. This may indicate potential selling pressures ahead as the coin may be reaching an overextended state.\n\nBig Eyes Coin About To Pounce On The Market\n\nBig Eyes Coin\u2019s community has carried it through 13 stages of presale, and now the end is almost upon us, as the end of the presale has been given a date; June 3rd. The official launch will follow soon after on June 15th, but for the remainder of this final month, the presale price will be cut down to $0.00017 which was the price during stage 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy selling its token at a fraction of a cent, Big Eyes Coin has confirmed its dedication to its community and its gratitude for its support. Now, we can look forward to the launch of BIG\u2019s casino and its NFT collection.\n\nThe Casino will allow holders to play P2E games using their $BIG as currency and betting chips. And the NFT collection will act as an owners\u2019 club by providing members with exclusive events, content, and opportunities.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has announced that it will allocate 5% of its token supply to a charity wallet dedicated to donating to charities that are saving the oceans, forests, and animals.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Fluctuates\n\nBitcoin (BTC) recently broke the $27,200 level, sparking speculation about its future price. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones expressed concerns about Bitcoin\u2019s regulatory challenges and diminished positive outlook due to lower inflation expectations. CoinShares reported four weeks of outflows from crypto investment funds, primarily in Bitcoin-related products, indicating negative sentiment.\n\nThe US dollar gained traction ahead of the US Debt Ceiling Talks and the release of retail sales data. Bitcoin\u2019s technical indicators suggest a potential bullish rebound if it maintains support above $26,800, targeting $27,800 or $27,500.\n\nThe answer to the first question we asked was \u201cIs Monero better than Bitcoin?\u201d may not be so easy to agree upon, and neither is the answer to the second question \u201cWhat is the next big thing in crypto?\u201d but we can make educated guesses on both of them.\n\nMonero mining does not require much computational power which has helped raise its price significantly. And with the end of Big Eyes Coin\u2019s presale, things in the crypto world might soon change, since we will be finally able to witness its potential in effect.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/BigEyesCoin/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin"

It was a lighthearted experiment on Bitcoin... until the tokens caught on and nearly reached a collective $1 billion market cap.\n\nGiven that, it's no surprise to see the trend catch on elsewhere since. And Ordinals and the resulting meme token frenzy is already having a sizable impact on Litecoin and Dogecoin alike. Here's a look at how it happened.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals\n\nIn January, software engineer Casey Rodamor released the Ordinals protocol, which let users transfer and receive individual satoshis\u2014that is, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin (1/100,000,000 BTC). The key upgrade here is that they could include inscribed data like videos or images, instead of simply storing transaction data.\n\nIn March, Ordinal inscriptions hit a new high after a pseudonymous creator named Domo launched the BRC-20\u2014short for \"Bitcoin Request for Comment\"\u2014 implementation. BRC-20 allowed the creation of \"fungible tokens\" on the Bitcoin network, opening the door for anyone to create meme tokens on the original blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs newer tools and infrastructure have made Ordinals easier to inscribe and handle, the total number of inscriptions has soared, topping 8 million as of this writing. And with over 24,000 BRC-20 tokens minted to date, the total combined market cap is currently over $618 million\u2014and previously neared $1 billion in total. Bitcoin transactions set a single-day record of 682,000 on May 1 amid the meme token frenzy.\n\nCritics of Ordinal inscriptions point to the rising cost of transactions on these blockchains now that blocks are filled with JPEGs and meme tokens, with some going so far as to call it a potential attack vector and that Ordinals and meme tokens should be blocked on the network. However, proponents of Ordinals say that the higher cost help secure the network.\n\nLitecoin Ordinals\n\nFollowing the Ordinals-fueled explosion in activity on the Bitcoin network, the inscription protocol made its way to the Litecoin network. Litecoin was launched in 2011 as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain and was a prominent cryptocurrency for years, though it has been overshadowed at times by newer and buzzier coins.\n\nOrdinals came to Litecoin in February after a challenge from pseudonymous Twitter user Indigo Nakamoto, who initially offered 5 LTC (around $500) to anyone who could port the Ordinals protocol to Litecoin\u2014and the prize pool quickly grew. Software engineer Anthony Guerrera launched Litecoin Ordinals after forking the Bitcoin code.\n\nIn May, the LTC-20 standard was introduced to Litecoin, bringing meme tokens to the network. Litecoin transactions surged after the addition of Ordinals, going from 100,684 transactions on May 1 to hit an all-time high of 584,836 transactions on May 10. Over 2.6 million Litecoin Ordinals have now been inscribed, according to the Litecoin Foundation.\n\nDogecoin Ordinals\n\nThat same month, meme token and digital artifacts using Ordinal inscriptions made their way to the original meme coin network, Dogecoin, by introducing the DRC-20 standard. Users began filling the blockchain by inscribing tokens into the smallest denomination of a Dogecoin, sometimes referred to as \"shibes\" or \"koinu,\" after copying the Ordinals protocol to create \u201cDoginals.\u201d\n\nDogecoin saw an even heavier surge in activity than its contemporaries, at least in terms of daily transaction volume, which jumped from about 88,000 on Monday to over 1.1 million on Wednesday. Not everyone is convinced that the trend is strong enough to last, however.\n\n\u201cSomething like this cannot become a real \u2018feature\u2019 because it has not had enough thought given to it,\u201d Dogecoin core developer Patrick Lodder told Decrypt this week. Furthermore, he believes that the impact on the broader network will cool the hype, adding that \u201csustained and growing pressure on Dogecoin will cause this to die off quickly.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify the terms used to describe the smallest unit of a Dogecoin."

        "content": "width=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nJoshua Henslee recently checked in with the Cryptocurrency Theory podcast to talk to Chad Bailey about Bitcoin SV, Ordinals, and much more.\n\nHow both Henslee and Bailey got into digital currencies and blockchain technology\n\nHenslee introduces himself as a Bitcoin maximalist and lays out his stance that the original Bitcoin had everything we needed.\n\nBailey asks Henslee for his Bitcoin story, what initially attracted him to the technology, and why it\u2019s important to him. Henslee tells his host about his background in integrating business software and payment systems and credit card processors. He tells viewers how this is a technical nightmare and is very inefficient.\n\nWhen Bitcoin ran up in 2017, Henslee began to pay attention. He read the white paper and instantly got it. Since then, he\u2019s been tumbling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole.\n\nBailey relates to this, saying he fell in love with it immediately. He says he\u2019s still amazed at how few people understand the technology, including people working in or studying computer science, who you\u2019d expect to be up to date on cutting-edge technology. He then asks Henslee, \u201cwhy Bitcoin SV?\u201d\n\nWhy Bitcoin SV?\n\nHenslee begins by giving some context. The reason he was interested in Bitcoin in the first place is because he knew it was light years ahead of the credit card processing solutions he worked with every day. He reminds us that Satoshi made it clear that peer-to-peer transactions with no trusted third parties are the way Bitcoin transactions are meant to occur. This is the polar opposite of how credit cards work, which is the reason for their problems.\n\nAfter small blockers caused Bitcoin fees to increase exponentially compared to what they were in the early days, Henslee began looking into Ethereum, Litecoin, BCH, and other blockchains. He eventually consolidated into BCH, and when an argument broke out in that camp, he landed on the BSV side.\n\n\u201cWhat Satoshi designed is nothing like what BTC is today,\u201d Henslee tells the audience. He explains how Bitcoin script allowed smart contracts on the blockchain; there was no block size limit, it scaled and had low fees, etc. \u201cEthereum only exists because the Bitcoin Core developers disabled the script,\u201d he tells Bailey, remembering how BTC Core developers chased Vitalik Buterin off and told him what he wanted to build wasn\u2019t allowed.\n\nBailey takes a moment to remind his viewers, many of whom are new to digital currencies, that BCH and BSV are far from down and out. He reminds us that they had a huge impact on the entire ecosystem when the forks happened, and just the other day, BSV shot up 30% on massively increased volume.\n\nA huge BSV price pump back in 2020\n\nBailey directs viewers to Henslee\u2019s video analyzing the historical BSV price. He asks Henslee to explain more about these events and what caused them.\n\nHenslee answers that two come to mind. The first came after the CoinGeek Toronto Conference in May 2019, and the other was caused by a false rumor coming out of China that Dr. Craig Wright had publicly signed with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s keys; this caused BSV to rise rapidly against other digital currencies and independently of them.\n\nOn this second pump, BSV moved into the top five coins by market cap and surpassed BCH for the first and only time so far. BTC maximalists melted down, sensing the threat of miners switching to the BSV chain, and moved to attack BSV.\n\nHenslee says he once again noticed BSV and BCH moving independently of the rest of the market last week. This is because of concerns about whether Ordinals will cause a BTC chain split or will cause the BTC blockchain to fail. He says this could happen faster than people expect.\n\n\u201cBSV only has to get to around 5% of BTC to start causing problems,\u201d he tells viewers.\n\nOrdinals, JPEGs, and bigger BTC blocks\n\nBailey asks Henslee to explain how a 4MB block on BTC was possible and what Ordinals are all about.\n\nHenslee explains that Ordinals are possible because of specific changes BTC Core developers made to Satoshi\u2019s original design, SegWit and Taproot. An independent developer found a way to put data on the blockchain even though BTC Core had explicitly blocked this.\n\n\u201cThe whole crypto market was under the impression that you can\u2019t do data on BTC. That changed in January 2023,\u201d he says.\n\nHenslee describes the innovation and activity on BTC since Casey Rodarmor found the loophole as \u201ca renaissance.\u201d He delves into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens (BRC-20), explaining how swapping BTC for tokens like $ORDI on the BTC blockchain is possible. The returns on this particular token so far have been absurd, proving the market has responded positively to these developments. Henslee once again iterates his position that this is a game changer.\n\nMining on BSV\n\nBailey wraps up by asking Henslee if he thinks BSV only having two miners could be a problem.\n\nHenslee explains that there\u2019s no real incentive to mine BSV in the wider ecosystem; the coin price is low, and the fees are so small that they barely register. This does open the chain up to potential attacks, and there have been attacks such as the empty block miner in 2022.\n\nThe only way to fix this is a higher coin price or more transactions, Henslee says. He notes that transaction fees could increase, but that debate has already happened in BSV, and the fees remain low.\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Whitepaper | Section One: The Introduction\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "In another move to showcase his support for cryptocurrencies, Republican Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy became the second candidate in US Presidential elections in 2024 to accept donations through Bitcoin. Vivek Ramaswamy made the announcement during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami and also urged his supporters to \"make the 2024 election a referendum on fiat currency.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy is the second candidate to allow donations through Bitcoin and before him, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also made a similar move that reflects the influence of Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies and the transformation the future of finance is going to witness.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy displayed a QR code during his speech, which links his supporters with a payment gateway with various donation options including Bitcoin and satoshis. The citizens and permanent residents of the US, who are eligible to vote can donate up to $6,600 to Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign and as a token of appreciation can receive a nonfungible token (NFT).\n\nHe clarified that he does not plan to issue any NFT for personal profits or campaign fundraising and is just giving an option to US voters to make their donation in the form of Bitcoin. Vivek Ramaswamy emphasized that he is not threatened by the rise of digital currencies.\n\nFreedom to mine Bitcoin\n\nVivek Ramaswamy stressed the freedom to mine Bitcoin in the US as the country recently surpassed China to become the global hub for mining activities. But, US President Joe Biden proposed a 30% tax on electricity used by cryptocurrency mining operations. Vivek Ramaswamy has opposed this tax calling it wrong, unfair, and an inappropriate exercise of federal power.\n\nAt the Bitcoin Conference 2023, Vivek Ramaswamy plans to unveil his Bitcoin policy which allows Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to function as parallel currencies. He believes that this can stabilize the dollar as the unit of measurement and the Federal Reserve mandate to focus on currency stabilization can be restricted.\n\nWith two candidates backing cryptocurrencies', the US Presidential Elections in 2024 will decide a lot of things for Bitcoin-like digital currencies. Currently, the governments of the world are still mulling over how much breathing space they should allow to a parallel currency and the massive dives in the value of Bitcoin-led cryptocurrencies also underlines its volatility.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Previously, the company\u2019s mobile app was only available in the United States, El Salvador, and Argentina.\n\nJack Mallers, the CEO and founder of Zap, Strike\u2019s parent company, explained that this expansion aims to address the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry, such as opaque exchanges, unregistered licenses, and the abundance of different coins.\n\nMallers expressed concerns about the regulatory environment in the United States, which led to the decision to move the company\u2019s headquarters to El Salvador.\n\nThe regulatory landscape prevented Strike from operating in New York, while El Salvador has embraced cryptocurrencies by implementing inclusive regulations to attract technological innovation.\n\nDuring a discussion, Mallers highlighted the success of Bitcoin adoption as a legal tender in El Salvador. He emphasized that the measure of success should not solely be merchant adoption but should also consider factors like increased tourism.\n\nInitially, Strike will allow users in the new markets to receive Bitcoin only. However, Mallers announced plans to introduce new features by the end of the year, including a debit card. For markets outside the US, Strike will facilitate U.S. dollar payments using Tether.\n\nMallers reflected on the significance of establishing the company\u2019s headquarters in El Salvador to serve a potential three billion people. He pointed out that even though this decision might have been mocked in the past, the current situation with Coinbase and Gary Gensler proves its validity."

The continuous rise in their holdings highlights their growing influence and raises intriguing questions about the evolving dynamics within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe #Bitcoin supply held by Shrimp Entities (<1 BTC) continues to relentlessly rise, expanding to an ATH of 1.31M coins. The cohort is currently experiencing a significant expansion of +26K coins per month, with only 202 (3.9%) trading days recording a larger monthly growth. pic.twitter.com/Fa2QCHxZPO \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) May 18, 2023\n\nThe data further reveals that shrimp investors are adding an average of approximately 26,000 Bitcoins to their cumulative holdings each month. This significant expansion is worth noting, considering that only 3.9% of trading days, equivalent to 202 days, have witnessed a larger monthly growth rate.\n\nThese statistics underline the sustained interest in Bitcoin among retail investors, who remain undeterred by its well-known price volatility.\n\nThe Shrimp Investor Effect On BTC Price Dynamics\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price, as reported by CoinGecko, currently stands at $26,914, reflecting a slight 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours, while the cryptocurrency was up 1.4% over the last seven days.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nThe surge in shrimp investors, indicated by their increasing accumulation of Bitcoin, can have multiple impacts on the current price of BTC.\n\nThe sustained interest and continuous buying pressure from shrimp investors can contribute to upward price momentum. As more retail investors enter the market and acquire Bitcoin, the increased demand can drive the price higher.\n\nThis influx of buyers, particularly if they are accumulating the cryptocurrency at an unprecedented rate, as mentioned earlier, can create a bullish sentiment that attracts further investors and potentially leads to price appreciation.\n\nBTCUSD backpedals to the $26K level. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nConversely, the impact of shrimp investors on the price of BTC can be influenced by market dynamics and investor sentiment. While their accumulation may indicate growing interest, the overall sentiment in the market, including the actions of larger institutional investors or regulatory developments, can also influence the price.\n\nIf negative news or a general bearish sentiment prevails, it can offset the impact of shrimp investors and result in a more stagnant or declining price.\n\n-Featured image from DELAYNA EARLEY / THE ISLAND PACKET VIA AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Reflecting on a decade of Bitcoin: From 10,000 Bitcoins for a pizza to a $1 trillion market capitalization\ufffc - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Parth Chaturvedi\n\nOn May 22, 2010, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz made history by purchasing two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. At the time, Bitcoin was worth just a fraction of a cent, and few people had even heard of it. Today, Bitcoin is the most valuable and widely recognised crypto asset in the world and had hit a peak market capitalization of over $1 trillion, during the last bull run. The value of 10,000 BTC today is approx ~$270mm!\n\nSo, while Laszlo Hanyecz\u2019s decision to trade 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas may seem foolish in hindsight, at the time, it was a bold and visionary move that helped demonstrate the potential of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and was the first recorded purchase of goods via a crypto asset. The story of Bitcoin Pizza Day is a reminder of the early days of crypto when enthusiasts were experimenting with a new and untested technology.\n\nToday, Bitcoin Pizza Day has become an annual celebration of the crypto revolution and the incredible journey that this asset class has taken over the past decade. BTC is now accepted by merchants around the world, used as a store of value by investors, and even recognized as legal tender in some countries.\n\nThe growth of crypto has been driven by a combination of technological innovation, financial speculation, and a growing recognition of the flaws and limitations of traditional financial systems. The recent banking crisis, \u201cDebt ceiling\u201d debate and Trillions in money printing have further made BTC\u2019s \u201chard money\u201d and \u201cfixed supply schedule\u201d narrative more appealing to the holders of \u201cDigital Gold\u201d!\n\nBut what does the future hold for this rapidly evolving asset?\n\nOne key trend in the future of BTC as an asset class is its increasing recognition and adoption by mainstream institutions. Major corporations such as Tesla, MicroStrategy and most recently PayPal have significant investment holdings in Bitcoin, and a growing number of traditional financial giants like Fidelity and BNY Melon are exploring ways to incorporate BTC into their products and services. This increased acceptance and integration by mainstream institutions could help drive greater stability and acceptance of Bitcoin in the broader economy.\n\nAnother important trend in the future of Bitcoin is the development of new and innovative use cases beyond simple transactions and store of value. Post the Taproot upgrade, there has been an explosion of innovation using the underlying Bitcoin Network. The most recent and impactful development has been Ordinals, which are being used to create unique inscriptions on the Bitcoin Network and can store metadata such as artwork or collectibles.\n\nAs we look towards the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem, it is important to continue investing in innovation, collaboration, and responsible regulation. This will require the participation and cooperation of a diverse set of stakeholders, including government regulators, industry leaders, and everyday users. By working together to address the challenges and opportunities of crypto, we can create a more inclusive, transparent, and secure financial system for all.So, let\u2019s raise a slice of pizza to Bitcoin, its incredible potential, and the exciting future ahead!\n\nThe author is Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "content": "May 22, 2023 will be the 13th anniversary of \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day,\u201d the event that saw the first documented BTC transaction for a real product.\n\nHere are this year\u2019s events.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day: what is it and what is being celebrated?\n\nIt was 22 May 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, made history by buying two Papa John\u2019s pizzas for 10,000 BTC. At the time, the value was about $41.\n\nHanyecz\u2019s intent was to demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s potential also as a currency for everyday transactions, a theory he created for himself as an early adopter of BTC.\n\nAnd so, Hanyecz posted an offer on a Bitcoin Talk forum, where he promised 10,000 BTC to anyone willing to buy him a couple of pizzas. It was not long before a forum user accepted the offer and ordered the pizzas for him.\n\nAs time went on, and as the price of BTC rose thanks to increased demand from users, the Bitcoin Pizza Day event became so symbolic for the entire crypto community that it is celebrated with dedicated events every year.\n\nNot only that, in addition to dedicated events, is also a day to meditate on the incredible value those two pizzas have achieved over time. For example, if we consider BTC at $27,000, now those two pizzas would be worth as much as $270 million.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day: crypto-exchange events for this 13th anniversary\n\nAmong the biggest supporters of Bitcoin Pizza Day, you can\u2019t miss the number one crypto-exchange in terms of popularity, Binance, which again this year is raffling off lots of prizes.\n\nTo celebrate #Bitcoin Pizza Day, we're kicking off a series of #BinancePizza events worldwide!\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s some of what you can look forward to:\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Pizza\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Giveaways\n\n\ud83d\udd38 #Binance merch\n\n\ud83d\udd38 And much more!\n\n\n\nBut which countries are we heading to?

Gate.io has offered 1 BTC as a prize.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t miss out! Join the #Bitcoin Pizza Day celebration with $1BTC. Submit your entry now to win!\u201d\n\nLaszlo and paying for pizzas in Lightning Network\n\nThree years ago, the programmer who became famous for Bitcoin Pizza Day wanted to strike again by buying more pizzas in BTC, but using the Lightning Network (LN). At that time, Hanyecz paid 649,000 satoshi, or 0.00649 BTC.\n\nDespite his first big \u201closs\u201d by buying the first two pizzas with 10,000 BTC, Laszlo wanted to demonstrate once again what could be the only solution to scale the Bitcoin blockchain, namely the Lightning Network.\n\nAt the time of writing, 0.00649 BTC is equivalent to $157, a far cry from the $270 million equivalent of the first pizzas."

        "title": "Husband Hid $500,000 in Bitcoin While Wife Hired Investigator - The Coin Republic",
        "content": "According to a recent report by CNBC, a divorce case came into the light as the wife took the help of forensic investigators. Currently, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is above $27,000.\n\nThe Bitcoin-linked Divorce Case\n\nA husband hid nearly $500,000 in BTC. His wife found out about it and hired investigators to find where the BTCs were. However, there is an interesting story behind this Bitcoin-linked divorce case. The wife was surprised that her husband was earning $3 Million annually, and didn\u2019t have many assets. After spending half a year on this puzzle, the wife shockingly found that the 12 Bitcoins in her husband\u2019s account cost half a million.\n\nNick Himonidis, a New York-based forensic investigator, said that 25% of his divorce-related cases involve some elements of cryptocurrency. According to him, \u201cSome of those are simple and straightforward.\u201d They just take help from trading platforms such as Coinbase.\n\n\u201cCoinbase-like companies hold the records of your brokerage account just like your broker at Morgan Stanley keeps your records,\u201d Himonidis further added. It is \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to trace and de-anonymize transactions in Monero. However, in one case, he had found around $700,000 worth of Monero on a Macbook.\n\nThe forensic investigator found something called a command line wallet for Monero. It is a kind of software wallet for which you need to go into a command line prompt to access this wallet. It is a Bash shell command on a Mac environment. One can\u2019t find it with the Finder on the Mac.\n\nHimonidis said that he and his firm track funds with the help of a tool, the Internal Revenue Service. This tool is only available to law enforcement and financial institutions. But even with new tools, his work is a literal race to cope up with the new technological innovations.\n\nFurthermore, Mark DiMichael, a certified cryptocurrency forensic investigator also shared about his experience. He said that it is difficult to seize when crypto is stored cold, but it is still traceable. He also added \u201c In a divorce case, you have to prove that crypto is there.\u201d That\u2019s sufficient for the judge to order remedies to retrieve those funds.\n\nBTC Price Performance\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin price is trading at $27,076.05 with a 24-hour trading volume of $7.42 Billion. Bitcoin is up 0.71% in the last 24 hours, with a current market cap of $524.1 Billion. While the year-to-date (YTD) price of BTC also showed a bullish outlook, as the most traded cryptocurrency by market cap soared more than 60%.\n\nSource: BTC/USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nIn the last 24 hours, BTC marked its low at $26,880.16 and high at $27,265.92. However, the recent weekly and monthly price analysis shows a bearish trend in BTC.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views and opinions stated by the author, or any people named in this article, are for informational ideas only and do not establish financial, investment, or other advice.
