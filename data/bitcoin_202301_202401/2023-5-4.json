        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 best Bitcoin stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. To skip the detailed analysis and recent updates about the cryptocurrency industry, go directly to the 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds.\n\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 and since then it has had the most volatile movements among all asset classes. If we look at Bitcoin\u2019s price history, its shows some interesting trends. In 2010, Bitcoin was worth $0.9 and reached $26.9 in 2011. Over the years, it showed high volatility. In May 2017, Bitcoin was worth $2000 and reached over $19,000 in December of the same year.\n\nDuring these ups and downs, the brightest year for Bitcoin was noted in 2021 as we reported previously that the cryptocurrency had reached its peak at $69,000. Later in 2022, cryptocurrency experienced one of its biggest disasters known as the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d mainly due to the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX\u2019s scandal, combined with Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes due to rising inflation. It was estimated that Bitcoin would close out in 2022 at $16,800. The cryptocurrency traded at even less than the estimated amount at around $16,530 on December 31, 2022.\n\nThe FTX scandal was revealed when the digital currency news website, CoinDesk published an article stating that the FTX\u2019s sister firm Alameda Research\u2019s balance sheet was full of FTT tokens. It was later found that the capital provided by FTX to Alameda Research were customer deposits. This led Binance to sell all of its FTT tokens leading to a crash in its price which would later lead to a plethora of withdrawals from the exchange, creating a severe shortage of liquidity in the firm, thus leading to its bankruptcy.\n\nFTX\u2019s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was later arrested and his bail bond was set at $250 million which is the largest one in history. The FTX collapse spread shockwaves among the industry and shepherded two major banks toward their collapse and a third one barely getting by and is currently being investigated by the US Department of Justice for accounts connected to Bankman-Fried's businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nCryptocurrency Outlook\n\nDespite facing a rough year in 2022, Bitcoin made a major comeback as it is up by 86.86% at the time of writing from its November lows and trading at $29,444, marking its highest price since June 2022. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest predicted that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price may reach $1 million in 2023. The director of institutional sales at Paradigm believes that this is just the beginning of the rally for Bitcoin. He wrote:\n\n\"Now we've seen rates start to fall sharply, with the market pricing in rate cuts in the second half of the year. The Fed and ECB balance sheets are also back in expansion mode. This is the bullish thesis but on steroids.\" In addition, Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, said about cryptocurrencies:\n\n\"2023 will be a transition year from the vicious, frigid crypto winter of 2022 into something hopefully a lot hotter in 2024.\"\n\nMoreover, cryptocurrency stocks have also rallied significantly as cryptocurrency exchange platform, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has been up by around 60% year to date as of April 30, and cryptocurrency mining company Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) is up over 250% year to date. During this crypto rally, we have curated this list of best Bitcoin stocks to invest in according to hedge funds that include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL).\n\n10 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we chose the companies based on their hedge fund sentiment. The companies on the list are directly or indirectly involved in Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin trading, and broader crypto trading.\n\nThe hedge fund sentiment around each stock has been taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 943 elite hedge funds.\n\nBest Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds\n\n10. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nInteractive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) is a brokerage company dealing in cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, bonds, futures, and more. The firm started cryptocurrency trading in September 2021, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin, and Bitcoin cash.\n\nOn February 15, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) announced, in partnership with OSL Digital Securities, the launch of cryptocurrency trading in Hong Kong for clients who have investable assets worth $1 million and institutions who have $5 million and more.\n\nThe hedge sentiment was positive toward Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in Q4 with 42 hedge funds holding a stake, compared to 35 funds in Q3. After increasing its investment in the company by 18%, Bermuda-based Orbis Investment Management is the biggest shareholder with 4.2 million shares.\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are some of the prominent Bitcoin stocks on our list in addition to Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR).\n\nLVS Advisory mentioned Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what is said:\n\n\u201cThe most notable new position this year has been our investment in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR). I published a detailed write-up (link here) and also appeared on the \u2018Yet Another Value Podcast\u2019 (link here) to discuss our IBKR thesis. To boil it down, IBKR benefits from higher interest rates, and the stock was available at an exceptionally cheap price. I believe IBKR represents a particularly good risk/reward bet and have made it our largest position.\u201d\n\n9. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nCME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is the leader of the financial derivatives market globally as it owns and operates multiple exchanges. Involved in the trading of cryptocurrencies futures, stock indexes, interest rates, and more, the group is one of the best Bitcoin stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nCME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is a dividend-paying stock that has increased its dividend for the last 13 years. At the time of writing, the company has a dividend yield of 2.37%. The company\u2019s latest dividend increase was recorded in February when it increased the quarterly dividend to $1.10 from $1.00.\n\nOn April 17, CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) announced the addition of new options to the range of standard and micro-sized Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) contracts with extended expiries.\n\nVGI Partners Global Investments Limited talked about CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) in its 2022 annual investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cCME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is a business likely familiar to you, being one we have owned in our global strategy since 2008 and which was our largest VG1 position at the end of 2022. CME operates futures and derivatives exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Dow Jones Index Services. On top of this, CME also owns other key assets related to foreign exchange trading & infrastructure and a strategic shareholding in Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) Index business. The key driver of trading activity for CME is in its interest rate derivatives products, where it has an effective monopoly in the exchange trading of interest rate derivatives in the United States, with benchmark products across the entirety of the interest rate curve. Demand for interest rate derivatives is driven by volatility in interest rate markets, whose effect is compounded by the number of bonds held by those looking to manage interest rate risk and, by extension, market liquidity. The below chart of average daily volumes of interest rate derivatives and US Federal debt held by the public illustrates the extremely strong relationship the size of the US Treasury market and volumes growth, although there are deviations around this primarily around Fed intervention (for example, at the start of the pandemic, volumes were suppressed by an enormous amount of Quantitative Easing (QE) and effectively zero interest rates which reduced the demand for hedging products). We expect the growth in the size of the US Treasury market, particularly in relation to privately held US treasuries as the Fed undergoes a balance sheet unwind, to remain a powerful underpinning of CME\u2019s interest rate derivatives business\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 70\n\nProviding its services in multiple countries, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a tech conglomerate with multiple products and services under its belt, including financial services and digital payment platforms. The latest step to penetrate the international crypto market taken by the company was in the form of partnering with Yellow Card. Through the partnership, Block\u2019s TBD will be used to send cross-border payments to any of the 16 African countries where Yellow Card operates.\n\nOn April 25, Credit Suisse lowered the price target of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)\u2019s shares from $105 to $100 while maintaining an Outperform rating. According to the firm, the company\u2019s gross profit estimates will be a little lower but the business model is set to experience any \u201cdisclosure and more conservative GPV growth in the second half of 2023\u201d.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 70 hedge funds held a stake in Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) worth $4.255 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. ARK Investment Management was the biggest shareholder with a little over 9 million shares in Q4 2022.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cBlock, Inc. provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block\u2019s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.\u201d\n\n7. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is headquartered in New York and is one of the most prominent financial services companies. Along with offering card products, it is the biggest issuer of travelers\u2019 cheques globally. The company got involved in Bitcoin when it announced to launch a crypto card in collaboration with Abra, a fintech company.\n\nOn April 20, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) reported an EPS of $2.40 and revenue of $14.28 billion in Q1 2023, beating expectations by $260 million. The 21.7% YoY growth was a result of card members spending more during the quarter and increased interest income with elevated average loan volumes.\n\nOn March 8, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share. The other announcement was the commencement of a share repurchase program of nearly 120 million common shares.\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leader in the automotive and clean energy industry. The company earned $64 million on Bitcoin in 2022 because of its trading activities and currently owns $184 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey\u2019s database, the company has seen positive sentiment in Q4 2022 compared to the previous quarter as the number of hedge funds holding a stake in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) increased to 91 in Q4 from 88 in Q3. Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group was the most significant stakeholder as it increased its holding in the company by 179% to 7.5 million worth $926.2 million.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was mentioned in the first-quarter 2023 investor letter of Aristotle Atlantic Partners. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a negative contributor to performance due to our underweight position relative to Russell 1000 Growth Index, as the company had strong performance in Q1. The strength occurred after the company partially reversed a previously announced price cut for its electric vehicles following a period of strong demand. Tesla also reported better-than-expected results for Q4 2022 during the first quarter. Tesla Motors designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar energy generation and energy storage products. Tesla sells more than five fully electric cars, among others, the Model X and Y SUVs, as well as the Model S sedan and Model 3 sedan. The company has a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers, typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla owners quick and reliable charging. Tesla offers certain advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. US customers generate nearly half of Tesla\u2019s sales. We see Tesla as the leading manufacturer of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). The company has achieved scaled production of EVs before the other large automobile manufacturers. The company\u2019s technology in battery production and self-driving technology is more mature than competitors\u2019 offerings. EVs are one of the fastest growing categories within automobile manufacturing. The profit margin in the automotive segment is significantly above automotive competitors which provides the company flexibility to price its vehicles more strategically as the competition eventually scales up their EV production. The direct-to-consumer sales model gives the company more control over its relationship with its customers as well as a source of higher profit margin since there is no dealership share of the profits.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "As for the exact details of how the hack happened, while the U.S. Department of Justice later fingered a Russian crypto exchange runner named Alexander Vinnik for laundering Mt. Gox\u2019s stolen bitcoin, the exact cause and culprit of the hack is \u201cstill a mystery,\u201d says Walbroehl. (The prevailing view by many in the space is that while Karpel\u00e8s was sloppy and perhaps even negligent with safeguarding the Mt. Gox data, he was not the mastermind and did not act with malice. Karpel\u00e8s was found guilty in court for manipulating data, but not for embezzling or hacking funds.) So who\u2019s the real villain here? The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is the juiciest unsolved mystery in the crypto space, but the question of who hacked Mt. Gox is arguably the runner-up."

        "content": "In Silicon Valley, Tim Draper is venture capital royalty. A third-generation investor, Draper was an early backer of some of the most pivotal technology to come out of California, from Hotmail to Skype. In recent years, his focus has been on Bitcoin and the broader ethos of decentralization, famously paying $19 million for 30,000 Bitcoin in 2014 that had been seized in the U.S. government takedown of dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nWhile some of his bets have not paid off\u2014including an investment in Theranos and repeated predictions that Bitcoin would reach $250,000\u2014he is continuing to throw his chips in with the pioneer cryptocurrency. In an interview with Fortune, Draper said he expects Bitcoin to soar in value amid economic uncertainty in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf the bear gets that angry to where the banks start falling apart, that actually means that Bitcoin will have a bull market,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a raging bull in the middle of the bear.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is currently sitting at just under $29,000. It\u2019s up nearly 75% since the beginning of 2023 amid the failures of major U.S. banks Signature, Silicon Valley Bank, and First Republic.\n\nDraper\u2019s support of Bitcoin does not extend to the entire crypto ecosystem. While he backed pioneering projects like the blockchain Tezos, he said he\u2019s wary of companies that are too centralized. Draper said he twice turned down an investment opportunity in Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s now-failed exchange FTX, arguing that there was no utility for its proprietary token, FTT, except for speculation.\n\nAs FTX rose in popularity in 2021 and 2022, Draper said he thought he had missed something, but was vindicated in November when the company collapsed in spectacular fashion.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a race to the bottom,\u201d Draper said about CeFi, or centralized finance, companies like FTX.\n\nHis concern now is with crypto regulation, as lawmakers debate legislation to establish guardrails for the industry and agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission target firms with enforcement actions. Draper said that when he speaks with startups in the space, they ask him about regulation, which had never before been the case.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re regulating by enforcement, they\u2019re just slapping people down and fining them and suing them,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste years of my life in court and trying to avoid some problem.\u201d\n\nDraper, who has advocated for breaking up California into six states, said that the only solution is to have a new political party in charge.\n\n\u201cThis is as controlling as the U.S. government has ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining business, they\u2019re killing the golden goose, and Silicon Valley is breaking up because of it.\u201d"

        "title": "Bhutan has secretly mined Bitcoin in the Himalayas for years - and it did it sustainably - Euronews",
        "content": "The South Asian kingdom hopes to become the second country in the world to run its state-owned crypto mine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBhutan, a South Asian kingdom nested in the Himalayan mountains, has recently revealed a secret that stunned the international financial market: the country has been quietly mining crypto for years without telling a soul - including its own citizens.\n\nAn even more stunning revelation was that the country has been able to mine crypto in a sustainable way compared to more commonly used methods which have been widely criticised for the large amounts of electricity required.\n\nBhutan has been able to mine for tokens using its massive stores of hydroelectricity - a renewable source of energy that can be largely considered to be \u201cgreen\u201d.\n\nBhutan has an abundance of hydroelectricity - a form of renewable energy that uses the power of moving water to generate electricity - thanks to the ancient glaciers feeding the many rivers flowing through the country.\n\nEnergy generated by hydroelectricity is currently fuelling the homes of most of the country\u2019s 777,000-strong population, and it represents 30 per cent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nBut Bhutan\u2019s recently revealed secret shows that the country has also been putting this immense resource to work for another purpose that could boost and sustain its economy in the future: the creation of its own crypto mines.\n\nBhutan is not alone in betting on cryptocurrencies for its future. The Central American state of El Salvador is currently the only country in the world to run state-owned crypto mines.\n\nWith its small size and limited resources, green crypto mining could be the solution to Bhutan\u2019s economic independence, a country that has struggled for years to establish its self-sufficiency.\n\nBhutan has the advantage of its resources and environment making the country an ideal space for digital asset mining operations.\n\nHydroelectricity is cheap, and the country\u2019s mountains, being so tall, provide the perfect environment to cool down heated-producing computers that are busy mining for Bitcoin. The country\u2019s crypto mines could, at least on paper, have little to no carbon footprint at all.\n\nWhy was this a secret - and why has it now been revealed?\n\nThe South Asian kingdom has reportedly been mining \u201cfor years,\u201d though it\u2019s not exactly clear for how long, where, or what earnings did it make.\n\nSpeaking to a local newspaper The Bhutanese, a government representative recently said that the country has begun mining \u201ca few years ago as one of the early entrants when the price of Bitcoin was around $5,000 (\u20ac4.548)\u201d.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has since soared to $29,228.12 (\u20ac26.591,74) as of Friday.\n\nThe reason why the country has shared its secret crypto-mining operations might be linked to the fact that the kingdom is now looking for partners to further expand its project.\n\nThe country\u2019s investment arm, state-owned holding company Druk Holding & Investments (DHI), and Nasdaq-listed mining company Bitdeer are reportedly seeking investors for $500 million (\u20ac454.9 million) to be used to develop green crypto mining in the kingdom.\n\nFundraising to create Bhutan\u2019s carbon-free digital mining will begin at the end of May, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, Bhutan\u2019s larger neighbours - India and China - remain wary of crypto.\n\nBoth India\u2019s government and central bank have taken a strong stance against it, while China officially banned crypto trading in 2021."

If a cryptocurrency is developed in such a way that a securities regulator could not identify a central, coordinated group responsible for driving up the value of the token, then the asset is less likely to be considered a security. That is one reason why decentralized finance (DeFi) projects take measures to decentralize the development of their projects and split up governance with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), as well as involve mechanisms like proof-of-stake as a consensus mechanism. The argument being that if people are both investors as well as participate in the growth of the project, either by staking the coin and becoming validators, or voting in DAO decisions, they are no longer solely relying on the \u201cthird party\u201d to produce returns that the Howey test requires."

        "content": "A pseudonymous Bitcoin and Lightning Network developer going by the name \u201cSupernestnet\u201d was poking around Ordinal Theory \u2014 Ordinals for short \u2014 on Thursday, when he discovered a bug.\n\nOrdinals are an attempt to make Bitcoin fun again. They allow text, images and code to be \u201cinscribed\u201d on a satoshi \u2014 the smallest denomination of bitcoin. Each satoshi has a unique number between 0 and (eventually) 2,100 trillion, assigned in the order in which they are mined. While usually thought of as fungible, the Ordinals protocol makes them non-fungible, like an NFT.\n\nJust as each satoshi is numbered, each Ordinals inscription has a number \u2014 there are more than 3.7 million of them to date.\n\nSupernestnet found a way to break inscription numbers, by inscribing a satoshi that he didn\u2019t own. Then, just as he inadvertently riffed on the Bhagavad Gita, thinking it was an homage to the film Oppenheimer, he also asked rhetorically whether he had \u201cbroken\u201d Ordinals.\n\nSource: https://github.com/supertestnet/breaker-of-jpegs\n\nNot so much, according to Danny Diekroeger, founder and CEO at Deezy, who works on infrastructure for the Lightning Network.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cInscription numbers are just a vanity metric putting an order to which inscriptions came first,\u201d he tweeted. \u201c[S]ome collectors like having the 100,000th inscription, for example\u2026these are all messed up now, because [Supertestnet]\u2019s transaction exposed some logic in the software.\u201d\n\nIt was an \u201cedge case\u201d and only provides a new example of a known issue, according to Ordinals advocate, LeonidasNFT. They said on Twitter, \u201cthere has been debate about inscription numbers being off by a lot more than one for almost three months now.\u201d\n\nPlus, it may all have been a marketing ploy.\n\nIs it funny? A little. Is it important? Not really.\n\nWhat is notable is that mean-average transaction fees have increased by just shy of 300% in the past two weeks, according to a Galaxy Research note on Friday.\n\nIt currently costs between $5 and $6 to get a transaction through the Bitcoin mempool.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the points of Ordinals, as its originator, Casey Rodarmor, noted right off the bat: \u201cSince Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong positive of the proposal.\u201d\n\nBut the recent bump in transaction fees likely has more to do with the \u201cDeFi on Bitcoin\u201d efforts around the BRC-20 token standard, which shares a similar technique with Ordinals but is used differently.\n\nGalaxy Research views this as \u201ca notable development for Bitcoin,\u201d but whether it has any long-term significance remains to be seen. It seems rather like trying to fit a diamond peg in a round hole.\n\nBut fine: Experiments are being run on Bitcoin. Some people think it\u2019s fun and good for Bitcoin. Others are mad.\n\nBitcoin continues, as always, just with slightly higher transaction fees.\n\nIn any case, Supertestnet has now changed their story.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The average Bitcoin transaction fee reached as much as $7.2, according to YCharts.\n\nTotal Bitcoin transaction fees between May 2021 and May 2023. Source: CryptoFees\n\nThe latest increase in BTC transaction fees is primarily attributed to a surge in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20 transactions. According to data from Galaxy Research, 50% of all Bitcoin transactions on May 2 were related to BRC-20 transactions.\n\nModeled after Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard allowing users to issue and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The standard was introduced in March 2023 by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst known as Domo.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard has quickly become a major trend in the cryptocurrency industry, specifically amid the sharp growth of the PEPE memecoin. The token has rallied more than 600% over the past seven days, reaching its all-time high of $0.00000216 on May 5.\n\nPEPE 30-day price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain isn\u2019t the only blockchain affected by the ongoing memecoin hype. Gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain have also been skyrocketing to new multi-month highs recently.\n\nOn May 2, ETH transaction fees hit an aggregate amount of more than $19 million, a level not seen since May 2022, according to Crypto Fees. The Ethereum blockchain remains the most expensive network in terms of transaction fees at the time of writing.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners have earned $50B from BTC block rewards, fees since 2010\n\nDespite the latest spike in Bitcoin transaction fees, the current BTC transaction cost is still far from all-time high levels. The highest Bitcoin transaction fees were recorded in April 2021, when the average BTC transaction cost almost reached $70 amid a major decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate. The previous highest point in BTC transaction fees was in 2017, with transaction costs surging above $60.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: Justin Sun\u2019s SUI-farming sins, PEPE\u2019s wild run, 3AC\u2019s oyster philosophy"

        "title": "Energy-Efficient Bitcoin Mining through Light - Optics & Photonics News",
        "content": "As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies grow in size and popularity, their processing eats up an ever-greater fraction of the world\u2019s electricity supply. But a collaboration between researchers in the United States and Italy has now shown it might be possible to slash that consumption while still maintaining network security by using integrated photonic circuits to implement a modified type of proof-of-work blockchain (Optica, doi: 10.1364/OPTICA.476173).\n\nBitcoin and blockchain\n\nBitcoin enables decentralized, censorship-resistant transactions thanks to the way that those transactions are parceled up into blocks and verified by individuals or organizations known as miners. Miners from around the world compete with one another to process each block and add it to the blockchain. They do so about once every ten minutes, with the winner in each case being awarded a certain amount of bitcoin.\n\nAdding a block involves using a so-called hash function to convert the block\u2019s transaction data into a fixed-length string of bits. The resulting \u201chash\u201d uniquely identifies the block in question and is referenced by all successive blocks. Since it is essentially impossible to reverse the process to derive the original data from their associated hash, the blockchain serves as an immutable record of irreversible transactions\u2014making it attractive for a range of other applications, such as safekeeping contracts, preserving medical data and counting votes.\n\nHashing is designed to be complex\u2014and to become more complex with time\u2014to guarantee the network\u2019s security. But that, in turn, means that competing miners have to invest in increasingly powerful processors and consume an ever-growing amount of electricity. As of 2021, cryptocurrency mining consumed more energy than all of Sweden.\n\nMore on hardware, less on electricity\n\nIn the latest work, Sunil Pai, David Miller and colleagues at Stanford University, working with researchers at New York University and the non-profit organization PoWx\u2014all in the United States\u2014and others at the Polytechnic University of Milan, Italy, propose using integrated photonics to limit energy consumption. Their scheme still involves a proof-of-work blockchain\u2014one that relies on computational effort (verified by other miners) to certify blocks. But rather than using Bitcoin\u2019s SHA-256 hash function, the scheme instead employs a function optimized for energy-efficient analog photonic chips.\n\nThe chips are built up from Mach-Zehnder interferometers, which consist of beam splitters and phase shifters incorporated into waveguides. The interferometers are arranged and manipulated in such a way that laser light passing through the circuit and then measured at the device\u2019s output provides the answers to specific matrix multiplications\u2014a key part of processing hash functions. Although energy is needed to convert electric currents into light and back again, as well as to tune the interferometers, the researchers say the passive nature of the calculations should save a lot of energy overall.\n\nAs the researchers explain, their overall goal is to change the way that miners allocate resources\u2014incentivizing them to spend more on their hardware and less on electricity. In this way, they argue, cryptocurrency mining should become less concentrated in those areas of the globe that receive the cheapest electricity while also becoming more resilient to fluctuating energy prices.\n\nLightHash, a new function\n\nAuthors Bogdan Penkovsky and Michael Dubrovsky of PoWx have previously outlined an optics-friendly hash function known as HeavyHash. This function is currently being tested on two smaller cryptocurrency networks, but it is very susceptible to errors in the analog optical hardware, such as loss or coupling mismatches. The new function, known as LightHash, is designed to overcome these problems by optimizing the trade-off between circuit size and accuracy and by averaging the outputs from multiple copies of the same circuit.\n\nTo demonstrate the potential of this scheme, the researchers ran computer simulations and experimentally tested an interferometer network capable of processing matrices with as many as four rows and columns. They found that the likelihood of errors shot up dramatically as the number of inputs and outputs increased, but they also showed that using four copies of the circuit can reduce the rate of errors in hashing by up to four orders of magnitude.\n\nFuture outlook\n\nDespite their scheme\u2019s susceptibility to errors, Pai and colleagues conclude that it could make photonic blockchains a reality\u2014reducing energy consumption by up to a factor of seven. They add that the technology might enable other applications, as they reported in a separate paper how the same experimental chip can be used to train a photonic neural network.\n\nHowever, the researchers say that the technology must be scaled up significantly before it can enter the marketplace\u2014from 4 to 64 inputs and as many outputs. They are also aiming to further minimize energy consumption by tuning the interferometers with electromechanical components and improving the optical-to-electrical converters.\n\nEven if these technical hurdles can be overcome, it still remains to be seen just how popular the photonic processors would be with Bitcoin enthusiasts. But the researchers envisage introducing the new technology slowly, gradually increasing the fraction of bitcoin mining done photonically. Plus, as Pai points out, the new hash function, although a break with the past, does incorporate SHA-256. This, he says, should \u201cstrengthen its case for adoption.\u201d\n\nCorrection, 4 May 2023, 08:25 EDT: This story has been updated to clarify the way that LightHash overcomes problems."

In a statement yesterday, the bank said that payment platforms are now banned from offering digital assets like Bitcoin to customers.\n\nThe Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) said that the reason was to \u201cmitigate risks.\u201d\n\nA number of popular companies\u2014including fintech giant Ual\u00e1 and online marketplace Mercado Libre\u2014offer clients crypto trading.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPayment service providers that offer payment accounts may not carry out or facilitate transactions with digital assets, including cryptoassets, that are not regulated by the competent national authority and authorized by the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) to their customers,\u201d the Thursday statement said.\n\nLos proveedores de servicios de pago no podr\u00e1n realizar operaciones con criptoactivos ni facilitarlas desde sus aplicaciones o plataformas web.\n\nLas personas interesadas deber\u00e1n realizar las operaciones por su cuenta.\n\n\ud83d\udd3dhttps://t.co/IKivQUQiMG \u2014 BCRA (@BancoCentral_AR) May 4, 2023\n\nThe bank did not expand on why, other than to protect customers, in the announcement.\n\nIt now means that major platforms, including Mercado Libre, Latin America\u2019s answer to Amazon, will no longer be able to offer Argentinians Bitcoin buying services.\n\nArgentina\u2014Latin America\u2019s third largest economy\u2014right now suffers from one of the worst inflation rates in the world: It soared past 100% last month for the first time in three decades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA number of crypto startups in the country and even one popular presidential candidate have preached the use of Bitcoin as a savior for ordinary Argentinians who cannot save or are being pushed into poverty because of the collapse of the peso.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t regulated in the South American nation, they are becoming popular. Blockchain data firm Chainalysis has said Argentina is one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets; last year it ranked it at number 13 in its 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index.\n\nBuenos Aires, the country\u2019s capital, last year hosted the major LaBitConf event where a number of cryptocurrency bigwigs\u2014including MicroStrategy boss Michael Saylor and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2014spoke about Argentina\u2019s growing role in the crypto ecosystem."

        "content": "In Silicon Valley, Tim Draper is venture capital royalty. A third-generation investor, Draper was an early backer of some of the most pivotal technology to come out of California, from Hotmail to Skype. In recent years, his focus has been on Bitcoin and the broader ethos of decentralization, famously paying $19 million for 30,000 Bitcoin in 2014 that had been seized in the U.S. government takedown of dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home Looking to make extra cash?

In an interview with Fortune, Draper said he expects Bitcoin to soar in value amid economic uncertainty in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf the bear gets that angry to where the banks start falling apart, that actually means that Bitcoin will have a bull market,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a raging bull in the middle of the bear.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is currently sitting at just under $29,000. It\u2019s up nearly 75% since the beginning of 2023 amid the failures of major U.S. banks Signature, Silicon Valley Bank, and First Republic.\n\nDraper\u2019s support of Bitcoin does not extend to the entire crypto ecosystem. While he backed pioneering projects like the blockchain Tezos, he said he\u2019s wary of companies that are too centralized. Draper said he twice turned down an investment opportunity in Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s now-failed exchange FTX, arguing that there was no utility for its proprietary token, FTT, except for speculation.\n\nAs FTX rose in popularity in 2021 and 2022, Draper said he thought he had missed something, but was vindicated in November when the company collapsed in spectacular fashion.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a race to the bottom,\u201d Draper said about CeFi, or centralized finance, companies like FTX.\n\nHis concern now is with crypto regulation, as lawmakers debate legislation to establish guardrails for the industry and agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission target firms with enforcement actions. Draper said that when he speaks with startups in the space, they ask him about regulation, which had never before been the case.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re regulating by enforcement, they\u2019re just slapping people down and fining them and suing them,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste years of my life in court and trying to avoid some problem.\u201d\n\nDraper, who has advocated for breaking up California into six states, said that the only solution is to have a new political party in charge.\n\n\u201cThis is as controlling as the U.S. government has ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining business, they\u2019re killing the golden goose, and Silicon Valley is breaking up because of it.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

        "content": "A spike in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain involving Ethereum-style tokens and non-fungible token (NFT)-like \u201cinscriptions\u201d has driven up congestion on the network, pushing the average fee rate to the highest in nearly two years while showering miners of the cryptocurrency with extra revenue.\n\nOn Wednesday, the average fee per Bitcoin transaction rose to $7.25, the highest since July 2021. For comparison, the rate so far this year had fluctuated between roughly 50 cents and $4, data from BitInfoCharts shows.\n\nWith transaction activity also surging, total fees on Bitcoin have also jumped.\n\nPer blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin\u2019s total transaction fees, which are paid by users to miners, jumped to around 124 BTC or roughly $3.5 million, on May 3, representing a 484% increase in the past 14 days.\n\n\u201cThis current fee spree is an anomaly,\u201d wrote Colin Harper, head of content at Luxor Technologies, a full-stack Bitcoin mining pool.\n\nBitcoin: Total Transaction Fees (Glassnode)\n\nIn recent days, a token type called BRC-20 (a play on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard), which facilitates the issue and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, has accounted for about 6% of all Bitcoin activity since its inception in early March, according to pseudonymous analyst and yield farmer Dynamo DeFi. This year has also seen the rise of Ordinals inscriptions, which are similar to NFTs and could be images or text strings inscribed into Bitcoin-based transactions. Both activities require transaction fees.\n\n\u201cInscriptions are the primary driver here,\u201d said Harper. \u201cBiggest difference now between this jump in transaction fees and past ones with inscriptions is that BRC-20 standard is a new way to inscribe. Adoption of this standard is driving fees up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe increase in transaction volume of that token standard has driven up demand for Bitcoin blockspace,\u201d said Jimmy Zhang, who works in the business operations and strategy department at blockchain data firm Artemis.\n\nKydo, vice president of Stanford Blockchain Club, told CoinDesk via direct messages on Telegram that \"Blockspace is the core commodity on any blockchain. People have found a new use case and the usage skyrocketed. BTC is more than money now.\" Kydo said they only use the one name publicly because of privacy concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiners who secure and maintain the Bitcoin network are beneficiaries of the recent increase in BTC transaction fees because they are rewarded in BTC fees for processing users\u2019 transactions.\n\nHarper predicts the increased transaction fees currently occurring in the ecosystem are \u201ca temporary phenomenon, though, and that transaction fees will revert back to a manageable mean soon.\u201d\n\nKydo said they think the current phenomenon will last a while, \"given how much people like NFTs.\"\n\nThe price of BTC has increased 1.2% in the past 24 hours to $28,884, at press time. The average transaction fee on Bitcoin is $7.25. According to data website cryptofees.info, Bitcoin\u2019s seven-day average fee stands at roughly $2 million, second only behind Ethereum\u2019s $12.5 million. BNB Smart Chain is next with about $575,000."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has surged 70% so far this year, but market liquidity for the world's top cryptocurrency is drying up.\n\nThat means smaller trades can increasingly move bitcoin prices. For example, a purchase of 462 bitcoins ($13 million) at the end of last month was able to move the price by 1% versus more than 1,400 bitcoins ($23 million) in January, according to CCData, cited by the Financial Times.\n\nThat's the lowest point of market depth for bitcoin trades via the stablecoin tether since May 2022, when the crypto market was reeling from price crashes and the failure of key industry players.\n\nOverall liquidity in the market has been declining since the start of the year, CCData research analyst Jacob Joseph told Insider over email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's worth noting that the decline in Binance's market share in April may have also contributed to the decline in liquidity for the above BTC-USDT pair,\" he added.\n\nBinance's woes may be related to a crackdown by regulators on the crypto exchange firm. Meanwhile, last year's collapse of FTX and sister firm Alameda created a gap in liquidity that other crypto firms have been unable to fill, traders told the FT.\n\nAnd while bitcoin's price has been on the up, especially as banking turbulence caused renewed confidence in the currency, it has stagnated lately.\n\nIn recent weeks, bitcoin has languished in the $28,000-$29,000 range. That has coincided with outflows of $72 million in digital asset investments over the last two weeks after six consecutive weeks of inflows, according to CoinShares data cited by the FT."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining can help with energy transition, industry expert says - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining could help spur more investment in renewable energy because the industry can use \u201cstranded\u201d energy from solar, wind or other forms of renewable electricity generation, argues Andrew Webber, chief executive officer of Digital Power Optimization.\n\nIn an interview with Forkast, Webber, the founder of the New York-based company that helps energy firms build crypto mining operations, said Bitcoin mining can help make renewable energy more profitable and \u201cif you can make renewable energy more profitable to build, people will build more of it.\u201d\n\nThe following Q&A had been edited for clarity and length.\n\nTimmy Shen: Could you tell me more about your company and how you work with energy firms?\n\nAndrew Webber: We use flexible data centers, Bitcoin mining or flexible AI (artificial intelligence) computing to deploy the assets and operations at energy sites where you generate power \u2013 whether that\u2019s wind power, hydropower or solar power. We use some of that excess energy, or energy that would otherwise have been undervalued by the market or stranded in a remote location because there\u2019s not enough transmission to get that power from one site to where it\u2019s going to be used.\n\nBy deploying a flexible data center at these generation assets, they can govern how much power they\u2019re using versus how much power they\u2019re selling into the grid. It creates this really profitable off-take scenario for them where they can capture incremental value for their energy.\n\nSo we think of this entire ecosystem not necessarily as a separate industry. We think that the idea of Bitcoin mining flexible data centers is one that\u2019s going to be picked up and utilized by the energy sector as a vertically integrated strategy \u2013 the same way they think about battery deployments at their sites, or green hydrogen production in the same way using excess available energy to electrolyze water and end up with hydrogen as a new fossil-free fuel.\n\nAndrew Webber, chief executive officer of Digital Power Optimization\n\nShen: How do you decide when you would like to turn off or turn on the computing power?\n\nWebber: It\u2019s really our partners\u2019 decision, but we help them think through that.\n\nThe idea is that you can basically keep running your data center based on a certain price in the grid. If grid prices or your opportunity cost for selling that power exceeds what you can make by using it for your data center, you just turn the data center off and that power can be redirected into the grid.\n\nI\u2019ll use an example \u2013 the 2021 winter storm in Texas. There was a huge price spike because there was not enough generation. Everybody needed to turn their heaters on. There was this huge demand for more power but there wasn\u2019t enough power. So grid prices went to like US$9,000 per megawatt hour, which is absolutely insane. And all Bitcoin miners turned off during that period because they didn\u2019t want to operate when power prices were that high. They would rather turn their mines off and sell their power into that elevated market so they make more money. But the grid also gets the extra power that it needs to offset some of those increased prices. So as a load-balancing mechanism for a given power grid, it\u2019s a really powerful tool to help fit the demands that society needs.\n\nShen: How profitable is Bitcoin mining and what factors would miners consider when they decide when to turn off their machines?\n\nWebber: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is set mostly by spot price and the amount of competition and network difficulty. Those things move together.\n\nThose two elements are really key drivers in deciding when and how a flexible data center might operate relative to grid prices.\n\nShen: Is there a certain threshold of Bitcoin price that you would suggest to your clients to turn off the machines?\n\nWebber: It depends on what difficulty does in response to spot price.\n\nIf Bitcoin [price] goes to a million [dollars], you might think miners are going to make a bunch of money. That\u2019s true for a little while. But competition will come in and you\u2019ll go back to making the same [amount] you\u2019re making today.\n\nIf Bitcoin goes down to US$10,000 or $5,000, it will force a lot of miners off that network because they\u2019re no longer profitable. They can\u2019t pay their power bills. So when they turn off, those who are surviving start making more and more Bitcoin. There\u2019s a balancing effect.\n\nIt matters what Bitcoin spot price does in the short term but over the long term, the network sort of self-adjusts. With the best energy sites or the lowest cost of production, you will outlast all of your competition and keep mining profitably even beyond that [Bitcoin] spot price decline.\n\nSo there is no magic number, there is no level at which this just becomes unfeasible. It\u2019s all about understanding the relationship between this flexibility \u2013 the uptime that you get versus the cost of your power versus the profitability of operating.\n\nA Digital Power Optimization project in the U.S. Image: DPO\n\nShen: Lots of miners struggled last year mainly due to low Bitcoin prices and high energy costs. Now Bitcoin is rising. How has the rising Bitcoin price affected the mining industry?\n\nWebber: There\u2019s some modest uptick in profitability, but it also changes the cost of the equipment.\n\nThe entry cost to participate in this market also changes because again, the equipment prices move as well as the profitability and the cost of energy. There are several different variables to determine how much money you can make. So it really hasn\u2019t changed that much in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI do think that Bitcoin trending upward slightly is a better market environment than Bitcoin trending downward quickly. There\u2019re investors that are coming back into the space. There\u2019s a little more comfort with people assuming it\u2019s not just going to go away tomorrow.\n\nMovement in Bitcoin spot price matters less to those miners that are doing this in an institutional way. If you buy equipment slowly over time, you don\u2019t really care that much about the fluctuations in Bitcoin spot price because the equipment is always sort of priced to reflect the current day\u2019s reality about future expectations.\n\nSo again, long story short, it does matter. It just doesn\u2019t matter as much as you might think.\n\nShen: How do you convince your clients to partner you? What are the opportunities and challenges the crypto mining industry faces at the moment, and why should the energy sector pay attention and get into Bitcoin mining?\n\nWebber: The regulatory overlay is a critical one, even more so than economic returns. The ability to soak up excess power at their generation sites is something that\u2019s really appealing to energy firms once we explain it to them.\n\nI think the lack of regulatory clarity has put a slowing, dampening effect on this space, especially here in the U.S. It is an attractive place to do it because there is a lot of excess power and we\u2019re putting up more renewable power every day and there\u2019s nowhere for it to go.\n\nThe regulatory component of all of this is the last real piece where these big energy companies, which are also heavily regulated in their own industry. Even outside of Bitcoin regulation, there\u2019s regulation in the power sector, which is very critical to these companies\u2019 operations, and they don\u2019t want to jeopardize their relationship with their energy regulators.\n\nWhat will happen over the next five or 10 years? I think more Bitcoin mining will be pushed onto green assets. I think it will be done by larger and larger institutions in a different sort of mindset than Bitcoin-first. It\u2019s going to be energy-first. The Bitcoin data center is just a tool that\u2019s used by the energy sector.\n\nShen: You\u2019ve said before on social media that Bitcoin mining could help with energy transition. Could you explain?\n\nWebber: I go to these energy conferences and there\u2019s an awareness among energy professionals that the energy transition from fossil fuels to green energy is extremely complicated. It\u2019s not just a matter of building more wind or building more solar.\n\nIf you can make renewable energy more profitable to build, then people will build more of it. If you can use flexible data centers as another strategy to make renewable energy assets more profitable by helping the developers and the owners deploy these data centers there, their profit margins go up, which means they can build more renewable energy assets. You operate them in a way that\u2019s more efficient and more productive by using every last electron that\u2019s created instead of just wasting it because there\u2019s nowhere for it to go.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge amount of curtailed energy where they literally turn off the solar farm or they turn off the wind farm because they have more power than they need and there\u2019s nowhere for it to go.\n\nOver the next decade, I believe that there will be more renewable energy created and driven by Bitcoin mining than people understand. I think it will be an important tool to really make renewable assets more viable than they otherwise would have been."

        "title": "U.S. Bitcoin Mining Consumed 50 Billion kWh of Energy in 2022 - Tom's Hardware",
        "content": "There've been rivers of ink written on all aspects of cryptocurrency ever since that fateful day of the Bitcoin whitepaper publishing. Still, one question that's repeatedly brought to the limelight (and understandably so) surrounds energetic and environmental sustainability. Now, the White House itself is adding fuel to the fire through its DAME Tax proposal, whose aim is, and we quote: \"making cryptominers pay for costs they impose on others.\"\n\nHow, you ask? By phasing in an additional 30% tax penalty for cryptocurrency mining firms on any energy they consume in that process. According to the White House, this is \"an example of the President's commitment to addressing both long-standing national challenges as well as emerging risks \u2013 in this case, the economic and environmental costs of current practices for mining crypto assets.\" The idea is simple: Bitcoin mining consumes a lot of power; this consumption drives electricity prices up; which is bad for everyone unfortunate enough to share a grid with a cryptocurrency mining firm.\n\nIt seems that the White House's hand has been forced by their very own report, which estimates total Bitcoin mining energy consumption in 2022 at an eye-watering 50 billion kilowatt-hours (in fact, the estimate places consumption anywhere between the low of 30 billion kWh and a high of 60 billion kWh). That's greater power consumption than all operating computers in the United States put together - and within the margin of error of the countrywide electrical consumption for as basic a necessity as lighting.\n\nIt's also more energy than Americans consume through their TV sets, and it's right here, in a nice graph:\n\n(Image credit: The White House)\n\nLet's get this straight right off the bat: public and private lighting is definitely (and inarguably) more important than Bitcoin mining.\n\nHowever, some arguments favoring the proposal seem to be mired in inconsistencies. Back when Intel announced its \"Bonanza Mine\" cryptocurrency mining chips, we took a relatively detailed look at Bitcoin's global power consumption and the utility that can already be extracted from it: anyone who has taken profits can attest to its utility; anyone who sold anything to someone and got paid in Bitcoin can attest to its utility; so can anyone who crossed an embattled border while invisibly carrying their wealth, or the citizens of El Salvador, where Bitcoin is legal tender. I'd be interested to know which process the White House used to quantitatively analyze cryptocurrency applications' social benefits before concluding that they \"are yet to materialize.\"\n\nThere's also the question of what amount of Bitcoin's energy consumption actually hails from carbon-intensive sources; according to the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), a global forum of mining companies that represents 48.4% of the worldwide Bitcoin mining network, it's estimated that in Q4 2022, renewable energy sources accounted for 58.9% of the electricity used to mine bitcoin - against an estimated 36.8% as of Q1 2021.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what results from this legislative push. For one, a 30% tax for cryptocurrency mining firms would drive most of them out of business, resulting in a concentration of hashing power in the hands of the few firms with strong enough financials to stand above the waterline. That would be terrible for Bitcoin, whose network security assumes that processing power is distributed, not concentrated. We wouldn't go so far as saying that Bitcoin Core devs would be open to changing Bitcoin's security model from Proof of Work (the cause for the monumental energy consumption) to Proof of Stake (Ethereum did this transition through its Merge, basically cutting its energy consumption on transaction validation by over 99%). But Ethereum isn't Bitcoin, and Bitcoin isn't the only Proof of Work cryptocurrency out there."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency, also known as digital or virtual currency, has become a popular form of investment and transaction. However, not all cryptocurrencies are the same.\n\nAt its core, cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital form of currency enabled to process financial transactions on the internet. Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency launched in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto through the publication of a white paper called \u201cBitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d.\n\nIn the crypto world, Bitcoin stands out as the leader of cryptocurrency and is widely recognized and highly regarded in this space as being robust and sound money.\n\nFor the last 14 years, Bitcoin and other digital currencies like Ethereum have emerged as alternatives to traditional government-issued fiat currencies. A fiat currency is a currency that is backed by a country and not a commodity like gold or silver, like the United States Dollar (USD).\n\nAt the start of 2023, the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization include: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Tether, Cardano, Polkadot, Dogecoin, XRP, Uniswap, and Solana. Market capitalization is the total value of the cryptocurrency asset when taking all the supply in circulation multiplied by the price.\n\nThese rankings of largest cryptocurrency coins fluctuate quickly in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies and are likely to change throughout the year due to their speculative nature. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two top competing cryptocurrencies in market capitalisation over the last decade as they have seen their total value grow year on year.\n\nCryptocurrency uses a unique, anonymous, and verifiable approach to making transactions peer-to-peer without using a third party involved, and is not controlled by a central authority.\n\nImagine you have a family member who is abroad and needs money over a weekend when banks are closed. By using crypto you can send money to your family member without the need of a bank. This is what it means to transact peer-to-peer: there is no third party involved.\n\nIt does this through the use of a decentralized open and public ledger, called the blockchain.\n\nA blockchain can be simply defined as a decentralized, digital ledger that records monetary transactions across a network of computers in a secure and transparent manner.\n\nCryptocurrencies will continue to be accepted in society because they address the key characteristics of money:\n\n\u2013 Durability of cryptocurrencies is supported by their decentralized and digital nature, which eliminates the risk of physical damage.\n\n\u2013 Divisibility allows for the creation of smaller units of the currency to facilitate transactions. Crypto enables micro transactions to be made.\n\n\u2013 Portability of cryptocurrencies is greatly enhanced by their digital form, which enables them to be stored and transferred easily through the internet.\n\n\u2013 Scarcity is ensured through the design of cryptocurrencies, with a limited supply of coins, preventing inflation.\n\n\u2013 Acceptability of cryptocurrencies is increasing as more merchants and individuals recognize and begin to accept them as a form of payment.\n\nHow Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nCryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum store transactions on a public ledger known as a blockchain. A blockchain can be thought of as a digital ledger available online for anyone to see and review. You can think of it in a similar fashion to a bank statement sent by the bank outlining all transactions you made at the end of each month.\n\nThe difference is that only authorized personnel and the client of the bank can review the transactions on a personal bank statement. Unlike an open-sourced blockchain which allows anybody to review all transactions. This ensures trust as the blockchain is verified by the whole of the network and can not be corrupted.\n\nEvery ten minutes all the Bitcoin transactions made globally are stamped together and put into an individual block or timestamp.\n\nThis ten minute block is then cryptographically chained to the previous block and cannot be changed or altered at any point in the future after it has been chained to the blockchain.\n\nCryptocurrency is created through a process called mining, which involves the use of computing power to solve complex mathematical problems which once solved miners are rewarded with newly minted coins every ten minutes.\n\nIf you are not a miner you can purchase cryptocurrencies from brokers and store them safely on cryptographic wallets which can be defined as hot or cold wallets.\n\nHistory of Cryptocurrencies\n\nDigital cryptography has been studied for decades and Bitcoin is an improvement on many past attempts at \u201cdigital cash\u201d experiments like Hashcash in 1997, which was created by Adam Back who is a developer that is also cited in the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nHashcash was a cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work algorithm, which is a concept adopted by Satoshi in his white paper.\n\nOther cryptographers and pioneers in this space include personalities like David Chaum who was the first person to propose the idea for cryptocurrency in a paper published in 1983, outlining an early form of anonymous cryptographic electronic money.\n\nBitgold, which is often deemed a direct precursor to Bitcoin, was designed in 1998 by Nick Szabo, another cypherpunk and pioneer in the crypto space.\n\nOver the last fourteen years, the crypto space has seen thousands of coins enter the market. Bitcoin and a few others such as Ethereum and Litecoin are withstanding the test of time.\n\nToday the total market cap of the space has grown to $1 trillion USD, hitting highs of $3 trillion in the 2021 bull run. The total market cap has been forecasted by some analysts to touch the market cap of Gold at $8 trillion in mid-long term future and eventually hit $100 trillion once the space matures.\n\nTypes of Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe crypto space has different kinds of coins created for different purposes. Some of these include:\n\nProof-of-work coins that can be used to buy things, store value, or act as a commodity similar to gold and silver. These coins include but are not limited to Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value and are often pegged to a fiat currency such as the US dollar or gold. Some of the most popular stablecoins today are Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Binance USD (BUSD). Proof-of-stake coins are cryptocurrencies that adopt a digital voting system where instead of miners using computers to solve complex math problems, a group of individuals are chosen to validate transactions based on the amount of digital coins they hold or \u201cstake\u201d in the network. The benefit of this concept is that there are large energy savings compared to the Proof-of-Work system. Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) are three popular coins that use proof of stake. Defi coins are cryptocurrencies that were born as applications that use public blockchains and crypto assets to disrupt the traditional finance sector. Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK), and Aave (AAVE) are three popular coins that serve decentralized finance purposes. NFTs are non-fungible tokens that are unique digital assets that represent ownership or authenticity of a specific item or piece of content. NFTs are secured and backed by blockchain technology and cannot be duplicated. Each NFT is unique and cannot be tampered with. Ethereum, Algorand, and Tezos are some names competing in this space to produce NFTs.\n\nAdvantages of Cryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrency offers the alternative of better security using decentralization, faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, anonymity in transactions, and reduced dependence on traditional financial institutions.\n\nIt is an attempt at a modern monetary framework, which works in harmony with the internet, is open 24-7, and ensures freedom and empowerment through the use of true digital scarcity.\n\nIt eliminates the need for intermediaries which significantly lowers transaction costs.\n\nCryptocurrencies can pose as monetary lifeboats against resistance to the degradation of fiat versus inflation.\n\nIronically some consider Bitcoin as one of the hardest money known to man yet cannot even be touched or seen physically, due to its intangible nature.\n\nThis is a benefit because it allows its holder to migrate from country to country and all that individual needs to access the holdings is a seed. This cannot be done with cash or gold as an individual runs the risk to have their physical holdings confiscated when crossing borders.\n\nDisadvantages of Cryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrency also has several disadvantages. These include a lack of widespread acceptance to date, high price volatility, the risk of hacking or loss of funds, regulatory uncertainty, and limited consumer protections.\n\nIn addition, its complex background and groundbreaking technology can be confusing for the average person. It has also been associated with illegal activities which could slow down a wider acceptance.\n\nFinally, there is an age-old debate in the crypto space about the overuse of energy consumption concerns related to the process of mining the coins.\n\nCryptocurrency Mining\n\nMining is the application of high-performance computing systems using specialized application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips.\n\nMiners receive new bitcoins as a reward for processing transactions through the reward protocol. The reward is distributed at a rate of 6.25 bitcoins every 10 minutes in a random and fair manner among miners who contribute to securing the network.\n\nThink of mining as an analogy to the process of finding physical gold. There is no guarantee that miners will discover gold, but those with the best resources have a higher likelihood of success. However, the outcome remains random.\n\nMining plays a critical role in securing the Bitcoin network and enables stakeholders to engage in transactions without intermediaries, even though the miners themselves are not intermediaries. Participants can freely join or leave the network at any time, thereby preserving their anonymity.\n\nCrypto Regulation\n\nRegulation has been debated over since cryptocurrency began a decade ago.\n\nToday many crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors are working with regulators to bring in regulation to help mature the industry.\n\nRegulatory uncertainty mainly surrounds crypto exchanges, stablecoins, security tokens, DEFI exchanges and yield products.\n\nThere are also questions about Over-the-counter (OTC) trading, margin loans, tax disclosures, and security disclosures still need to be answered, with the US who will likely set the global standard for regulation.\n\nIn America, the SEC and CFTC have unofficially classified Bitcoin as a commodity. This means that when regulation surfaces it will not be regulated as a security unlike other altcoins.\n\nIn Europe, The EU has voted against the banning of proof-of-work in 2022 which was deemed a positive move for crypto acceptance.\n\nCrypto Security\n\nBlockchain uses advanced security features like hashing, digital signatures, and public-key cryptography to secure transactions.\n\nDespite this, blockchain is not completely secure and can have vulnerabilities that affect its security. Each investor should avoid speculating on risky projects and carry out due diligence.\n\nStoring your wealth in Bitcoin and Ethereum is considered a safer option, while other cryptocurrencies pose a higher level of risk. It is important to do your due diligence before speculating on a cryptocurrency.\n\nCryptocurrency Wallets\n\nOnce cryptocurrency is purchased on an exchange it is recommended that you withdraw the crypto asset from that exchange and deposit it onto a digital wallet. A wallet can come in different formats.\n\nA hot wallet is a wallet that is always connected to the internet. This can be found in an app on your mobile phone.\n\nis a wallet that is always connected to the internet. This can be found in an app on your mobile phone. A cold wallet is a physical USB looking type device that remains offline. Keeping your cryptocurrency offline or in a cold wallet, such as a Ledger Nano device, helps to protect it from hacking.\n\nBy holding your cryptocurrency on a digital wallet, you are sovereign which means you own your own private key and access to your cryptocurrency. The private key provides you access to a secure digital wallet, which is protected by a seed phrase consisting of 12 to 24 words.\n\nIf the cold wallet is lost, the seed phrase can be used to recover the cryptocurrency on another device.\n\nFor added security, it\u2019s recommended to keep a smaller amount in a hot wallet, which is connected to the internet, and store the majority of your cryptocurrency in a cold wallet. Some popular cold wallet brands include Ledger and Trezor.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency is a unique, anonymous, and verifiable approach to making transactions peer-to-peer without a third party involved.\n\nWhat are the benefits of cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency offers financial privacy, lower transaction fees and is decentralized. This means that it is not controlled by any single authority or institution. It also offers the potential for more secure and transparent transactions due to the use of blockchain technology.\n\nHow is a cryptocurrency created?\n\nThere are different ways cryptocurrency can be created. When we refer to Bitcoin, new Bitcoin is created through the act of mining. Miners use this technology to account for the transactions on the network and order them into blocks for which they are rewarded every ten minutes. When a block is found new Bitcoin is mined out of the protocol which increases the money supply incrementally every ten minutes.\n\nWhat are the risks of using cryptocurrencies?\n\nIf you hold cryptocurrency on an exchange you are at risk of the exchange running away with your crypto. It is important to get the crypto off the exchange and into your private wallet."

        "title": "How Cardano's Hydra Layer-2 Is Challenging Bitcoin Lightning Network and Ethereum Sharding - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Cardano released its Layer-2 scalability solution, Hydra.\n\nHydra introduces a novel scaling solution that challenges Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.\n\nAccording to Charles Hoskinson, Cardano\u2019s new solution could make it the fastest, most scalable network.\n\nCardano has long been vying for a spot among the top cryptocurrency projects. Now, with its scalability solution Hydra up and running, it has solidified its position as a major player in the industry, standing alongside its more established peers, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHydra, the Layer-2 solution from the Proof of Stake (POS) Chain, is one of the most highly anticipated upgrades. Now that it is here, people are excited to see it deliver Cardano\u2019s promise of being the fastest and most scalable payment network in the world, challenging the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhat Is Hydra?\n\nThe Hydra Head Protocol or Hydra is Cardano\u2019s open-source Layer-2 scalability solution that, according to Charles Hoskinson, would make Cardano the fastest payment network in the world.\n\nAnnounced in September 2019, after much anticipation, delays, and hurdles, Hydra finally made it to the Cardano main chain in May 2023, thanks to engineers from the Cardano Foundation and IOHK.\n\nHydra is an isomorphic scaling solution. This means it replicates Cardano\u2019s functionality and security guarantees on an off-chain ledger network while maintaining communication between the two layers.\n\nCardano Hydra use case. Source: Hydra Head Protocol.\n\nIt operates almost similarly to state-channel solutions such as Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network and Ethereum\u2019s Raiden Network. Users can securely and instantly perform transactions on their private networks, in this case, Hydra heads, and settle the result on the main chain, enabling faster and cheaper transactions while keeping the integrity and security of the network.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about Hydra is that off-chain ledgers through Head nodes can act as special dApps for developers who look to scale their apps. With Hydra, developers can independently run on-chain scripts or software stack on their private nodes and securely publish the result on the main chain instantly and at a low price.\n\nHydra brings a solid solution, allowing Cardano to compete with Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nIn Contrast with Other Scalability Solutions\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have long established themselves in the cryptocurrency world, with the latter powering a myriad of Layer-2 protocols. Additionally, Ethereum\u2019s sharding and Bitcoin\u2019s lightning network are some of the best solutions in the space, earning the networks a collective market cap of $807 billion.\n\nAlthough Cardano is often compared with Bitcoin and Ethereum, its string of delays and issues drew much criticism from the community, leading to slow growth evident with its $13 billion market cap. However, with Hydra in the mix, it can finally sit at the table with its solution.\n\nEthereum, Cardano, and Bitcoin Compared\n\nWhile Ethereum Sharding, Bitcoin Lightning Network, and Cardano\u2019s Hydra solution may come from the same family or operate similarly, comparing or saying one is better wouldn\u2019t be fair. Each scalability solution has its pros and cons and addresses different challenges.\n\nSharding is a Layer-1 solution that focuses on increasing the network\u2019s capacity and increasing the overall transaction throughput of the network. It breaks the blockchain into shards that process transactions parallel to the main chain.\n\nHowever, according to Charles Hoskinson, Sharding is \u201cvery complex.\u201d Because of this complexity, network security and performance drastically defer because it operates on the main chain. Additionally, it requires a lot of resources and can be expensive to implement.\n\nHydra, on the other hand, creates an independent off-chain ledger network that replicates the security and functionality of the Cardano chain, allowing it to maintain both security and performance without congesting the main chain. It doesn\u2019t rely on soft or hard forks, making it inexpensive and straightforward to implement.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin Lightning Network is a Layer-2 solution on top of Bitcoin, which uses bi-directional off-chain payment channels between users, enabling fast, cheap, and scalable transactions.\n\nHowever, because it uses payment channels, it only supports asset transfer, unlike Hydra, which allows developers to run scripts and elaborate transactions instantly off-chain as it would on the main chain.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAn Ethereum founder accused Cardano Founder of contributing nothing to Ethereum.\n\nMany competitors called Cardano\u2019s EUTXO design a security flaw; Hoskin replied that the model made it more secure.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nCardano\u2019s Hydra solution brings competition to the space. The better the competition, the better the solutions, leading to greater adoption. Cardano\u2019s new protocol could significantly elevate the network\u2019s status in the cryptocurrency industry and attract more developers to build apps on the network.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Hydra on Cardano? Hydra is Cardano\u2019s Layer-2 scaling solution that creates independent off-chain ledgers with functionality, features, and security similar to the Cardano main chain. Is Hydra built on Cardano? Yes, Hydra is built on Cardano. It is a Layer-2 scaling solution that processes transactions on an off-chain ledger and settles the result on the main chain. Is Hydra a Layer-2? Yes, Hydra is a Layer-2 solution on Cardano. It operates on top of Cardano to maximize the throughput and functionality of the underlying blockchain. Is Cardano Layer-1 or Layer-2? In blockchain-speak, Layer-1 is the base blockchain where all network activity and transactions are validated and finalized. Cardano is Layer-1.\n\nRead about other blockchains\u2019 developments:\n\nHow Flare\u2019s New Blockchain APIs on Google Cloud Impact Web3\n\nRead what Charles Hoskinson has to say:\n\nCardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Responds to Jab by Ethereum Co-Founder"

        "title": "Developer Inserts 'Bug' in Bitcoin Ordinals\u2014How Bad Is It? - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThere\u2019s fresh controversy brewing in the Bitcoin Ordinals community after a developer under the moniker \u201cSupertestnet\u201d initiated a transaction that had no input or output, but is nevertheless seen as valid.\n\nThis resulted in the Ordinals\u2019s inscription numbering system crashing, sparking concerns that the whole protocol may now be broken.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions, also known as \"proof of ownership\" inscriptions, are essentially a way of attaching metadata to a specific Bitcoin transaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis metadata can include information about the digital asset being transferred, such as its title, description, and ownership details. So far, it's also been used for a wide array of on-chain media inscriptions including artwork, profile pictures, playable games, and video-based web apps.\n\nUnlike Ethereum-based NFTs, which require the use of a separate token and smart contract to record ownership and transfer of digital assets, Ordinal inscriptions are recorded directly on the Bitcoin blockchain without the need for a sidechain or separate token.\n\nThe transaction in question, which did not include any satoshis (smallest unit of BTC), was found in block 788200.\n\n\u201c[The Ordinals protocol] validated the inscription (3492721) attached to the input, which sounds like a bug,\u201d Ludo Galabru, staff engineer at Hiro Systems commented on the issue on GitHub. \u201cPhilosophically, the satoshi inscribed was transferred to the miner as a transaction fee, but was nevertheless inscribed by its previous owner.\u201d\n\nThe Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor agreed that \u201cit shouldn't be possible to inscribe sats that you don't own,\u201d suggesting the transaction is indeed a bug.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHowever, fixing the bug by making [the Ordinals protocol] ignore this inscription would change inscription numbers after the curious transaction. I'm honestly not sure what to do!\u201d added Rodarmor soon after the issue was found.\n\nBut is there an actual danger for the Ordinals protocol?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals under scrutiny\n\nAccording to Danny Diekroeger, founder of Bitcoin Lightning platform Deezy, the bug doesn\u2019t pose any risk to the Ordinals protocol itself.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think this is totally fine. In fact, I think inscription numbers were broken already early on anyway,\u201d Diekroeger tweeted on Friday.\n\npersonally, i think this is totally fine. in fact, i think inscription numbers were broken already early on anywayhttps://t.co/sGrldlh8FT \u2014 danny \u26a1\ufe0f deezy (@dannydiekroeger) May 4, 2023\n\nSupertestnet agreed that there\u2019s no immediate danger to the protocol itself, although he is \u201cnot sure not sure what long-term consequences will be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe short-term consequence was that the guys who were running indexing software had to fix the bug,\u201d Supertestnet told Decrypt.\n\nWhat actually happened and what prompted the Austin-based developer to run such an experiment, which Diekroeger described as \u201cthe first valiant attack on ordinal inscriptions?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Supertestnet, it all started during a recent conference in Austin, where a hackathon was held and people were supposed to be coming up with projects, and the idea was born to try to make \u201csome weird thing in Bitcoin and create a transaction that sends somebody zero Satoshis.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one at the conference wanted to do that project, so I did something else. But afterward, I tried it and created one of these weird transactions and broadcasted it to a miner who mined it for me,\u201d Supertestnet told Decrypt.\n\nCalling himself the \u201cbreaker of jpegs,\u201d Supertestnet not only inserted this bug into Ordinal explorers but also created a tool that lets other users increase the attack.\n\nWait did I just break ordinals? https://t.co/V41NQt9aQz \u2014 Super Testnet (@super_testnet) May 4, 2023\n\nYet, he also admitted that \u201cit\u2019s not entirely clear to me exactly what's happening right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally, when you create an inscription, you have to create a Bitcoin address that has some satoshis in it. And then you create an image that the software assigns to one of the satoshis in your Bitcoin address. But my Bitcoin address had zero satoshis in it. So it seems that it assigned it a negative number, which is weird by itself,\u201d explained Supertestnet.\n\nDespite that, when the software encountered this negative number it appears to have tried to give this inscription a number.\n\n\u201cIt took that and then either made it the first satoshi in the block, which then belongs to the miner, or it put it in the previous transaction\u2019s transaction fee, which then went to the miner. Either way, it definitely went to the miner like that's the inscription,\" Supertestnet said. \"But that's not supposed to happen. You're not supposed to be able to inscribe somebody else's satoshis without their consent. So that's like a bug.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThings are \u201ca little more complicated\u201d for Ordinals explorers, according to the developer, because all the numbers after his inscription are off by one.\n\n\u201cIf they decide to fix that, they will have to undo all the numbers that have been issued since then, like decrementing them all by one or by however many they're off by one now. But they might not fix it, or they may fix it for the future but all the previous ones are going to remain like they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know what they'll do, maybe they\u2019ll decide that it\u2019s not important anymore and that it\u2019s not the bug but a feature,\u201d added Supertestnet."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price: Why the Nasdaq Bubble Suggests BTC Will Surge 200% - CCN.com",
        "content": "The Nasdaq, which plunged in value following both the dotcom bubble and financial crisis, more than doubled in value in the following five years of post-bubble recovery. Like the Nasdaq, bitcoin could recover rapidly in the medium-term, analysis suggests.\n\nWith the 200-day moving average of bitcoin reversing its trend for the first time in 16 months and various technical indicators demonstrating a positive near-term trend for the asset, many industry executives and investment firms like Pantera Capital believe bitcoin has bottomed out.\n\nIf $3,122 Was the Bottom, Bitcoin is En Route to a Strong Recovery\n\nAs suggested by Bloomberg\u2019s emerging markets analyst Michael Patterson, if bitcoin found its bottom at $3,122 in December 2018, the dominant cryptocurrency may be en route to a strong upside price movement in the years to come.\n\n\u201cIf Bitcoin has in fact bottomed out, history suggests there could be further upside. The Nasdaq more than doubled in the five years after its post-bubble low and has since reached record highs that are well above its peak during dot-com mania,\u201d Patterson wrote .\u201d\n\nSince hitting its 12-month low, the bitcoin price has rebounded to $5,000, recording a staggering 60 percent increase in value within less than four months.\n\nPreviously, former International Monetary Fund (IMF) economist Mark Dow said that bitcoin investors should head for the exits if the asset fails to recover to the $5,000 to $6,000 region, as it would lead the asset vulnerable to a potentially large downside movement.\n\nWhat Makes Analysts Confident Bitcoin Found its Bottom?\n\nEarlier this week, economist and global markets analyst Alex Kr\u00fcger said that whether bitcoin has reached its bottom at $3,122 or not is not up for debate.\n\nPurely based on technical indicators and data, Kr\u00fcger emphasized that when the bitcoin price crossed $4,200, it broke out of its 16-month bear trend.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cThe crypto bear market has been over for three months now. BTC breaking above $4,200 will mark the end of the bear trend that started in January 2018. Going to miss this big fellow.\u201d \u201cThis is not a call. Not a matter of aging well or not. A break above 4200 technically ends the bear trend that started Jan 2018. Facts don\u2019t care about opinions. If strong selling resumes later on, that would represent a different trend.\u201d\n\nMoreover, fundamental analysts have said that there exist billions of dollars waiting on the sidelines in the cryptocurrency market to be allocated to crypto assets in the future.\n\nNearly $3 billion ready to flow into BTC and alts. https://t.co/kWTNCtbyZM \u2014 Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) April 5, 2019\n\nThe caution of strategists in the financial sector is that in the 1990s when Japan\u2019s Nikkei plunged during an intense correction, it struggled to recover until 2009.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to compare the price trend of bitcoin and major stock markets because of contrasting environments.\n\nAs seen in previous bull runs of the cryptocurrency market, cryptocurrencies tend to move in cycles. When the market is on an upside trend, parabolic movements are often spotted. When the market initiates a downward movement, it often suffers intensified volatility.\n\nBitcoin Moves in Short Time Frames\n\nThomas Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said that bitcoin tends to record its biggest gains in a 10-day time frame of every year.\n\n2/ Reminder that BTC generally generates all of its performance within 10D of any year.\n\n\u2013ex the top 10 days, BTC is down 25% annually since 2013 pic.twitter.com/zoEocEEZvu \u2014 Thomas (Tom) Lee (not the drummer) FSInsight (@fundstrat) April 2, 2019\n\nAs such, the way bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market behave in terms of short-term price movement is drastically different than how major markets such as the stock market of Japan moves.\n\nIndustry executives remain confident that bitcoin has established its bottom because of the level of activity in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry across all leading markets including the U.S., Japan, and South Korea."

Discover SCENE\n\nCoinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. based by volume, announced that it will be discontinuing its lending product, Coinbase Borrow, from next week.\n\nThe company will stop issuing new loans from May 10, although current users of the product will not be impacted as their loans will remain active until their maturity.\n\n\"We regularly evaluate our products to ensure we\u2019re prioritizing the offerings that our customers care about most,\" a Coinbase spokesperson told Decrypt. \"Effective May 10, we will stop issuing new loans through Coinbase Borrow. There is no impact on customers\u2019 outstanding loans, and no action is required from them at this time.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaunched in November 2021, Coinbase Borrow allows users from certain U.S. states to borrow up to $1 million using Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral.\n\nCustomers can borrow up to 40% of the value of the Bitcoin in their accounts at an annual interest rate of 8.7%, according to the exchange's website.\n\nNo relation to regulatory pressure, says Coinbase\n\nThe exchange has also indicated that the closure of Coinbase Borrow has nothing to do with the potential enforcement action that may be undertaken following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) slapping the exchange with a Wells Notice in March.\n\nA Wells Notice is a letter that the SEC sends when it is considering bringing an enforcement action. The notice gives the recipient the opportunity to respond to the allegations made by the agency and explain why they believe enforcement action is not warranted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Coinbase\u2019s case, the Wells Notice alleged that the company's staking products constitute unregistered securities, while also mentioning several other aspects of the exchange\u2019s activities, including the Coinbase Wallet.\n\nIn response to the SEC\u2019s Wells Notice, Coinbase stated it does not list securities, its Coinbase Wallet product does not constitute a broker, and the exchange\u2019s staking services have nothing to do with a securities offering.\n\nLast week, the San Francisco-based exchange also revealed that it was suing the SEC over its \u201cpetition for rulemaking\u201d that was sent to the regulator last July and still remains unanswered. The legal action aims to get the agency to respond to Coinbase\u2019s plea for clearer crypto regulations.\n\nIn a separate development earlier this week, Coinbase has launched a new international exchange that will initially offer Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures, with trades settled in USD Coin (USDC)."

        "title": "Does the next Bitcoin halving suggest an incoming bull run? - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "The last bull cycle, when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $70,000, seems like a long time ago. Since the second half of 2021, several flash crashes and company closures have played a part in dragging Bitcoin\u2019s value on the charts. Nonetheless, a recovery effort in 2023 has raised hopes about Bitcoin\u2019s future prospects once again.\n\nAs the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 2024 draws closer, several analysts expect the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency could embark on its next bull run and touch earlier highs.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin halving?\n\nAs you may know, a variety of factors affect Bitcoin\u2019s price. One of them is the halving event, which takes place once every four years. As the name suggests, Bitcoin halving is an event in which the reward for Bitcoin miners is cut by half.\n\nHalving effectively reduces the rate at which new coins are created, thus lowering the supply of bitcoins in the market. A quick note here is that miners validate transactions and add data to the public ledger, for which they are awarded newly created Bitcoins.\n\nThe last halving occurred in May 2020, in which rewards for validating a block were cut to 6.25 BTC from 12.50 BTC. Currently, around 19 million Bitcoins are in circulation out of the total 21 million that can ever be created. Following the next halving, rewards for Bitcoin miners will be slashed to 3.125 BTC.\n\nTheoretically, as supply declines and demand rises and the price of Bitcoin should rise over time. In the backdrop of slumping crypto prices last year, Du Jun, Co-Founder of Huobi, told CNBC that Bitcoin might get to see its bull run only in 2024 or 2025 following the halving event.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamie Sly, an analyst at the educational platform CryptoCompare, told CNBC that investors tend to accumulate Bitcoin in the run-up to the halving event. He also said that the accumulation period from the market bottom after the breakout to the halving date has historically spanned at least 500 days.\n\nMore recently, Bitcoin bull Tim Draper also said that the halving would have a positive effect on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAlso read: A guide on how to bridge from Solana to Ethereum\n\nJudging by historical performances, the last couple of halving events have been followed by a bullish Bitcoin. After the last halving took place in May 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price rallied by 622 percent leading up to April 2021.\n\nIts price jumped from around $9,000 on May 13, 2020, to a then all-time high of $65,000 by April 14, 2021. Similarly, the halving event which took place before that in July 2016 saw Bitcoin jump by 2,824 percent to $19,000 by mid-December 2017.\n\nSpeaking to Kitco News in July 2022, Florian Grummes, the managing director of investment advisory firm Midas Touch Consulting, said that Bitcoin\u2019s next rally would likely occur six to 12 months ahead of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nAt the time, Bitcoin\u2019s price was trading around $23,000 after witnessing several corrections since its November 2021 all-time high of $70,000.\n\nThe present scenario\n\nSince the start of 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen by over 70 percent from its December 2022 close of $16,600. At the time of writing, it hovered around the $29,200 mark after rising by as much as 5.6 percent in the last three days.\n\nMany in the community believe the market is showing signs of recovery, underpinned by fundamental growth and other factors such as the US banking crisis and soaring worldwide inflation.\n\nNonetheless, not all is rosy for Bitcoin, as some analysts remain bearish on the asset. Mark Mobius, a well-known fund manager, predicted in May that the king coin would fall to $10,000 by 2023-end as higher interest rates make buying or holding Bitcoin less attractive since the coin does not return any interest.\n\nEarlier in December 2022, financial institution Standard Chartered made even bolder predictions by saying that Bitcoin could decline to $5,000 by 2023-end. An analyst said that an increase in crypto bankruptcies would damage investor confidence in the digital asset industry.\n\nThe prediction was made after the FTX collapse cascaded to other cryptocurrency-related businesses in the sector.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is showing some positives leading up to the next halving event scheduled for April 2024. However, there are a few other factors to consider here. Speaking to Blockworks, Lex Sokolin, chief crypto economics officer at ConsenSys, revealed that investors are currently risk-averse amid possibilities of a looming recession.\n\nThe same could make it difficult for investors to pour money into cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhatever the situation, calls for the next Bitcoin bull run will only become more obvious once macro factors have a chance to take their course in the coming months.\n\nAlso read: What will happen to cryptocurrencies if the US economy crumbles"

        "content": "The proponent of a second cryptocurrency mine in New Brunswick says the project is still alive, despite concerns from both the government and N.B. Power that the industry would put a strain on the provincial power grid.\n\nChief Fuels said in a press release Thursday that its plans are \"proceeding on schedule\" and the facility will open in Grand Falls in early 2024.\n\nThe company said it has hired a contractor to develop the mine's electrical substation to draw energy from N.B. Power's grid, which the utility worries could be overburdened if more cryptocurrency mines were also on the system.\n\nIn March 2022, Premier Blaine Higgs signed a cabinet order endorsing the utility's refusal to service new crypto mines.\n\n\"The benefit you get back from that versus the consumption of energy \u2014 it was just not a project that made sense for the province,\" Higgs said Friday.\n\nPremier Higgs signed a cabinet order last year endorsing the N.B. Power's refusal to service new crypto mines. (Radio-Canada)\n\nBut it appears the utility signed an agreement to power the second Grand Falls plant before the freeze was put in place.\n\nSpokesperson Dominique Couture wouldn't comment on the Chief Fuels proposal by name, but said \"prior to the pause coming into effect in 2021, two customers completed their interconnection agreements.\"\n\nChief Fuels president Michael Scully turned down an interview request from CBC News and did not respond to follow-up questions sent by email.\n\nSuch \"mines\" run thousands of computers around the clock to conduct millions of transactions and earn cryptocurrency, consuming large amounts of electricity.\n\nDemand on the grid is a concern for N.B. Power because several of its generating stations face uncertain futures or reliability issues.\n\nThe utility came close to not being able to meet an all-time peak demand for electricity during a cold snap in February.\n\nOne bitcoin mine owned by Hive Blockchain Technologies is already operating in Grand Falls. It uses 70 megawatts of power a year.\n\nHive Blockchain Technologies in St. Andr\u00e9 has several warehouses of bitcoin miners in operation. (Shane Fowler/CBC News)\n\nChief Fuels said in its release it has scaled back its original plan for a 50-megawatt mine to 26 megawatts \"due to various commercial considerations.\"\n\nIt said it has \"informed\" N.B. Power of that change.\n\nNo comment from Grand Falls\n\nThe mine was announced in November 2021 when Taal Distributed Information Technologies Inc.said it would buy Chief Fuels and set up the mine in a former McCain Foods fertilizer plant in Grand Falls.\n\nThe combined annual electricity consumption of the Hive and Taal mines, 96 megawatts, is close to the yearly generation of the small modular nuclear reactor model being developed by Arc Clean Energy of Saint John.\n\nA Grand Falls town official said last week she was not sure why the Taal-Chief Fuels mine had not opened yet.\n\nEconomic development director France LeMoignan said the town received the Chief Fuels press release on Thursday.\n\n\"We cannot comment on the situation until a permit has been issued by the municipality's planning department,\" she said in an email.\n\nShe said \"discussions\" have taken place with the town \"but no official documentation has yet been issued.\"\n\nChief Fuels describes itself as a majority Indigenous-owned fuel and lubricant company \"affiliated\" with Michaud Petroleum, a Grand Falls company.\n\nOn its website, Chief Fuels lists its address on Waasis Road at Oromocto First Nation.\n\nTaal said in a November 2021 press release it was acquiring all the shares in Chief Fuels, allowing it to open its crypto mine in a 5,600-square-metre warehouse in Grand Falls."

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals have recently taken the crypto industry by storm, with registrations surging to an all-time high of 3.4 million last week. This explosion of interest in the protocol is exciting news for the NFT market and suggests that the crypto industry is becoming more interested in NFTs and their applications beyond Ethereum.\n\nOrdinals Protocol allows users to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions. Despite the skyrocketing fees, the surge in daily enrollments began on April 21st and peaked on May 1st, with over 372,000 enrollments in just 24 hours. This surge in registrations contributed to an all-time high in daily BTC transactions on May 1st, reaching 682,281.\n\nAlthough most registrations for the protocol are text-based, followed by applications and JPEG images, the surge in enrollments is significant for the industry. Bitcoin Ordinals NFT is compliant with the BRC-20 standard \u2013 Bitcoin Request for Comment number 20 \u2013 which was introduced last March, enabling new tokens to be minted on the BTC network.\n\nI can't believe my eyes BRC-20 demand leading to a 700% increase in fees AFTER what we've seen with Ordinal Inscriptions 12,800% increase in fees from BEFORE Ordinal Inscriptions launched 300,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool pic.twitter.com/oyLceu6ODe \u2014 trevor.btc @ NYC (@TO) May 2, 2023\n\nWhat\u2019s also interesting is that BTC maximalists used to be very opposed to ordinals, but appear to be coming around. The surge in registrations may be evidence that Bitcoin Ordinals NFT is becoming more accepted among BTC maximalists as they realize the potential for NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe explosion in numbers and daily enrollments is exciting news for the crypto industry and suggests that there is a growing demand for NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. With the surge in interest in Bitcoin Ordinals NFT, we can expect to see more innovation and growth in the NFT market.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals NFTs are not only contributing to the growth of the NFT market but also to the overall Bitcoin network by incentivizing miners, prioritizing valuable transactions, and enhancing network security. While the high fees may put a higher price tag on transactions on the network, proponents of Ordinals believe that the benefits outweigh the costs and that it opens up new use cases for Bitcoin, bringing in liquidity, new users, and developers, ultimately making Bitcoin more valuable through better user experience and more use cases."

        "content": "On 1 May, 60% of all transactions on Bitcoin used Taproot, hitting an all-time high.\n\nBitcoin network also recorded $3.5 million in transaction fees, reaching a 2-year high.\n\nThe bull market of 2o23 has led to a sharp spike in network activity on the Bitcoin [BTC] chain. The number of daily transactions and unique active addresses have grown steadily over the last four months.\n\nRead Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBlockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant devised a Bitcoin Network Activity Index to capture the burgeoning activity on the chain. The index takes into consideration key indicators like transactions, addresses and demand for block space.\n\nInterestingly, the primary reason behind the rise in network traffic was transactions driven by Taproot addresses, as underlined by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nBitcoin reinvents itself\n\nUp until 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s reputation was restricted to being a peer-to-peer (P2P) payments network with not much real-world utility apart from settling transactions on the chain.\n\nHowever, with the Taproot upgrade, Bitcoin started to position itself like other conventional layer-1 blockchains, enabling deployment of smart contracts on the chain and minting of Ordinals NFTs.\n\nAccording to a data scientist from analytics firm Glassnode, Taproot transactions accounted for over 37% of spent outputs on the Bitcoin network. The demand for Taproot was also reflected through the adoption and utilization metrics.\n\nThe data showed that on 1 May, 60% of all transactions on Bitcoin used Taproot, hitting an all-time high.\n\nAnother notable trend which was worthy of attention was the growing dominance of text inscriptions over image inscriptions when it came to Taproot transactions. In fact, text inscriptions propelled more than 50% of all transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nTaproot was an upgrade to improve the privacy, scalability, and security of Bitcoin. It introduced new signature schemes and a flexible transaction structure, to make transactions more efficient and cheaper.\n\nMiners rake in the moolah\n\nDue to the rise in network traffic, miners managed to collect huge transaction fees. Users were willing to shell out more to get their transactions validated quickly. On 3 May, Bitcoin network recorded $3.5 million in transaction fees, hitting a 2-year high.\n\nOn expected lines, Ordinals accounted for a significant chunk of the total fees paid to miners, averaging nearly 21% over the past week, data from a Dune dashboard showed.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nThe crypto community has a divided stance on Ordinals, and in general the idea of smart contracts on Bitcoin. The naysayers object to its non-financial use case which would congest the network and drive up fees on the chain.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC exchanged hands at $29,240, marking a marginal increase of 0.37% in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap."

Fabian Sch\u00e4r, Professor of Blockchain, Bitcoin and Financial Market Technology at the University of Basel, has a front row seat to view these developments.\n\n3 minutes\n\nFabio Canetg swissinfo.ch\n\nThe shape of our monetary system is politically significant, Fabian Sch\u00e4r told SWI swissinfo\u2019s Geldcast podcast. The professor of financial market infrastructure is one of the world\u2019s most sought-after experts on the theme of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. He has been invited to speak at G20 meetings and most recently at the Indian Ministry of Economic Affairs.\n\n+ Listen to Fabio Canetg\u2019s regular take on hot economic topicsExternal link\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere at such meetings is very impressive,\u201d says Sch\u00e4r. The G20 is a loose association of world\u2019s biggest economies, attended by the most powerful political actors. Proposed changes to international regulations are regularly discussed first at these meetings, mostly behind closed doors.\n\nFintech is a hot topic at the moment and it\u2019s Sch\u00e4r\u2019s speciality.

Read more: Let\u2019s Talk: the future of Crypto Nation Switzerland\n\nCryptocurrencies are important innovation drivers. Payments with bitcoin no longer need a central counterparty \u2013 money can be sent directly from buyer to seller. This is different with regular money transfers where payments go through a third party, often a bank.\n\n\u201cI was extremely sceptical\u201d\n\nSo will bitcoin prevail as a new currency? Sch\u00e4r is very careful with his forecasts. \u201cIf everything develops as it was originally intended, then bitcoin could possibly become a store of value in future,\u201d he says. But Sch\u00e4r doubts that bitcoin will become an established means of payment.\n\nNevertheless, he finds the innovations in cryptocurrencies very exciting. As a youth Sch\u00e4r developed an interest in computer science by spending a lot of time playing video games. Later, when studying economics, he started to delve into cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI was extremely sceptical at first,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the more I looked at cryptocurrencies, the more fascinated I became.\u201d To Sch\u00e4r, bitcoin is an important innovation. \u201cThe system is incredibly well thought out.\u201d But he also warns of risks: \u201cLarge fluctuations in value are a problem.\u201d Sch\u00e4r recommends investing in self-education and a better understanding of cryptocurrencies before trading.\n\nSch\u00e4r puts his advice into practice in his role as a professor specializing in cryptocurrencies. He can exchange ideas with many interesting people from the political and private sectors.\n\nHis research covers the future role of the financial infrastructure and the changing role of intermediaries, such as banks. Much remains unclear, says Sch\u00e4r, but he can be clear on one thing: \u201cThese roles will evolve\u201d.\n\nThe SWI swissinfo.ch Geldcast Author Fabio Canetg completed his doctorate in monetary policy at the University of Bern and the Toulouse School of Economics.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has shown very bullish trends lately, and investors are super excited as many altcoins, including VeChain (VET) and Collateral Network (COLT), will likely rise in value in alignment with Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nAccording to a report by The Crypto Basic, daily Bitcoin trading volume has increased since March 4. This has convinced many market analysts to believe that Bitcoin (BTC) could pass $35,000 in April. If this happens, then the crypto market may kiss the bears goodbye because a major increase in Bitcoin will stir other cryptocurrencies in a positive direction.\n\nBut as of press time, Bitcoin seems to be repressing. Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 11% since trading at over $30k last week. The price of Bitcoin, at the time of writing, is $27,506.52.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nVeChain (VET)\n\nVeChain is a Layer-1 smart contract platform aimed at decentralizing the luxury goods industry. With an efficient team and many big names as partners, VeChain continues to gain popularity in the space. VeChain enables businesses to build dApps and conduct secure and transparent transactions.\n\nBased on an analysis report by Changelly, VeChain has been in an upward trend, increasing by 6.33% in the past seven days. Also, the price of VeChain has increased by 22.04% over the last month, adding a colossal average amount of $0.0049 to its current value \u2014 $0.0224. This presents VeChain as a solid asset if it continues to grow. Collateral Network (COLT)\n\nLike VeChain, Collateral Network (COLT) is also designed to help businesses and individuals by easily unlocking liquidity from their physical assets. In other words, existing businesses or start-ups can pledge their assets as collateral to obtain loans. Physical assets currently accepted by the platform include fine wines, art, collectibles, vintage cars, real estate, and watches, among others.\n\nWhen borrowers send their physical assets to the platform, the team at Collateral Network authenticates, values, and stores the assets in its vault for the loan duration. Then, it mints NFTs to represent the value of the assets.\n\nThese NFTs are then fractionalized, allowing multiple lenders to contribute to the loan when they purchase the NFTs. Therefore, individuals or businesses needing loans receive them instantly, while lenders earn significant returns from fixed interest rates.\n\nInterFi Network and SolidProof have both audited Collateral Network, and a 33-year liquidity lock after presale will be performed after the presale ends, cementing Collateral Network as one of the best investment options on the market!\n\nDue to its unique model, experts have identified the Collateral Network (COLT) as the next big thing in crypto, with a 3500% growth prediction. Interested investors can join the ongoing presale to buy the Collateral Network (COLT) token at a discounted price.\n\nIf you wish to purchase the $COLT token for only $0.014, follow the links below and take advantage of this unique opportunity to earn an extra 40% purchase bonus on your investment!\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Pepe (PEPE) And Collateral Network (COLT) Surge In Trading Volume As Bitcoin (BTC) Growth Slows - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The meme coin market boomed over the weekend with the attention created by Pepe (PEPE), which increased by over 1000% in just two days. This new meme coin has shocked analysts who formally predicted that trading volume would slow during the first week of May. While projects like Bitcoin (BTC) have started to do just that, Collateral Network (COLT) and Pepe (PEPE) have experienced huge surges in trading volume.\n\nWhile Pepe has surged 1000%, analysts are predicting a 3500% surge for Collateral Network.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network \u2013 Best Token Presale In 2023\n\nCollateral Network has capitalized on the new attention to DeFi created by Pepe, selling almost 50% of its latest presale rounds supply. The Collateral Network project is quickly building momentum throughout the DeFi market and is expected to increase in price by 3500% before its presale ends.\n\nCollateral Network is unlike any other project in the market. The project developers have created an innovative platform that lets individuals unlock liquidity from otherwise illiquid assets such as super cars, jewelry and real estate on the blockchain. Instead of needing to physically sell the asset, they can take out a loan against it through the clever use of asset backed NFTs.\n\nTo optimize the number of investors who can loan money, NFTs are fractionalized so investors can get involved with smaller amounts of capital without needing to fund the entire loan and generate a weekly interest rate, paid weekly.\n\nWith the presale gaining popularity, COLT tokens are expected to increase from $0.014 to $0.0168, marking a 68% ROI in the next week alone possible for early investors of COLT.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nPepe Meme Surges 1000% Over The Weekend\n\nPepe, a new memecoin that builds on the famous pepe meme, is the latest cryptocurrency to make headlines. On the 1st of May, Pepe (PEPE) increased in price by over 1000% to $0.000001384.\n\nThis price hike resulted in a popularity boost across Twitter, and caused its user base to increase from just a few hundred investors to over 78,000. On Monday the 1st, Pepe was also listed on the cryptocurrency exchange MEXC Global, which is best known for its wide range of memecoins. This has made purchasing Pepe significantly easier than before and is expected to trigger additional trading rallies.\n\nDue to its sudden popularity, Pepe has been listed on Coinmarketcap, which caused trading volume to surge to over half a billion USD. Though its value has since decreased by 13.92%, investors expect Pepe to continue influencing the memecoin market throughout May.\n\nCan Bitcoin\u2019s Price Rise Again In May?\n\nBitcoin made mainstream headlines in April after becoming one of the best-performing assets in the world. While the traditional banking sector experienced an increase in turbulence, Bitcoin (BTC) increased in price to $30,979, sparking a huge rise in trading volume throughout the crypto market. However, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has started to decline gradually moving into May.\n\nOver the last five days, Bitcoins (BTC) price has decreased by 1.81%, with one Bitcoin selling for $28,743 at the time of writing. Despite this decline, daily trading volume has remained above $15 billion daily, which implies that investors remain bullish about Bitcoin.\n\nAnalysts however have split predictions as to whether or not Bitcoin will rise or fall over the next few weeks. While some suggest an additional surge could take Bitcoin to $31k, others believe that Bitcoin growth may temporarily slow as the market corrects itself.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
