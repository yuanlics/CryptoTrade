        "title": "State Street sees opportunity in court win for spot bitcoin ETF - American Banker",
        "content": "Gabby Jones/Bloomberg\n\nTraditional financial institutions are inching ahead on cryptocurrency custody and other services as exchange-traded funds that track the price of bitcoin take a step closer to hitting Wall Street.\n\nA recent court decision may push the Securities and Exchange Commission to reevaluate its previous rejection of a spot bitcoin ETF, and banks should be ready to meet the market, experts said.\n\nWall Street has dragged its feet on touching volatile digital currencies, but last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the SEC's rejection of the crypto-asset manager Grayscale's application to list a spot bitcoin ETF was \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs would give investors exposure to bitcoin on an exchange without having to own the underlying asset since the manager of the fund would hold the bitcoin. The SEC has already approved bitcoin futures ETFs, which track contracts to buy and sell bitcoin at a predetermined price on a later date. The appeals court ruled that the federal regulator couldn't provide a \"coherent explanation\" as to why it approved futures bitcoin ETFs, but not the proposed spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe court's decision has stirred optimism that a spot bitcoin ETF will be approved, said Carl Fornaris, co-chair of the digital assets and blockchain technology group at the law firm Winston & Strawn. He added that financial institutions are monitoring developments so they can keep up with regulation.\n\n\"I think this is something that is very much on [banks'] radar, and they will want to be poised and ready to go if and when the SEC does issue an approval so that they have a product with the right team ready to launch,\" Fornaris said.\"\n\nFornaris said it's also important that financial institutions discuss digital-asset plans with federal regulators, which he said have been \"skittish\" about banks offering crypto products and services.\n\nState Street, one of the largest custodian banks in the world, is ramping up crypto services to take advantage of the potential opportunities presented by the court ruling, like custody and administration for ETFs. The Boston-based bank sees a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. as a way to increase accessibility to the currency for institutional investors, without them having to own it, said Frank Koudelka, global head of ETF solutions at State Street.\n\nThe court decision could also open the door for other spot bitcoin ETF applications, including from major players like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity, Fornaris said. Banks like State Street then act as the fund administrator of the ETF, providing custody of ETF shares, fund accounting and transfer agency.\n\nState Street is slated to be the fund administrator for a spot bitcoin ETF listed by the investment manager VanEck, if approval goes through. Head of Digital Assets Jay Biancamano said the institution is working to start offering custody of bitcoin and ethereum by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval.\n\n\"For most clients, building to have custody and administration under the same umbrella is preferable,\" Biancamano said. \"So that's what we're looking to do. Offer not only our fund administrator services and ETF services, but also custody \u2014 all to the same clients.\"\n\nThe bank had previously been working with the crypto custody firm Copper on the service, but pivoted away in March and is working with a different undisclosed partner, Biancamano said. Bank of New York Mellon also announced last fall its plan to hold digital assets in custody for some clients, but the bank declined to comment for this story.\n\nCryptocurrency BNY Mellon crypto custody application didn't anticipate SEC accounting rule Bank of New York Mellon didn't think it would need to record on its balance sheet digital assets held in custody when it asked the New York State Department of Financial Services for permission to offer the service, according to a filing obtained by American Banker. The SEC has since said otherwise. June 28\n\nBiancamano said providing administrative services for spot bitcoin ETFs is similar to other ETFs, but that State Street has more stringent rules and requirements around crypto because it's unregulated and volatile. Koudelka said a spot bitcoin ETF provides end investors with the same benefits of other ETFs, like intraday liquidity and access on an exchange.\n\n\"We continue to see more innovation, bringing in innovative asset classes, to allow for better diversification and asset allocation for end investors,\" Koudelka said. \"So when I look at spot bitcoin \u2026 it's really what the ETF issuers are trying to bring. 'How do we get investors married up with products that they're interested in and put it in a very liquid wrapper?'\"\n\nKoudelka and Biancamano said that spot bitcoin ETFs are just the tip of the iceberg, and that State Street is hearing from clients that plan to eventually operate crypto ETF strategies that offer more than just bitcoin, such as an index or a multi-asset basket.\n\n\"I think what you'll see in the market is hopefully we'll have a crypto ETF approved within the next year,\" Biancamano said. \"That will result in a stampede of others looking to get into the space. \u2026 Then you'll start to see clients or asset managers look to diversify and offer more sophisticated products with exposure to the space.\"\n\nThe appeals court ruling, which came out Aug. 29, isn't an automatic win for spot bitcoin ETFs. Now, the SEC could appeal the decision, which would send the case either to the Supreme Court or an \"en banc\" appellate-panel review. If the regulator doesn't appeal, the court could mandate that the SEC approves Grayscale's application, or it could direct the SEC to reassess, in which case it could either approve or reject the application on different grounds.\n\nBut sentiment among the traditional financial market around crypto is shifting, experts said.\n\nCaitlin Long, CEO of the crypto-focused institution Custodia Bank, said that BlackRock's application for a spot bitcoin ETF similar to Grayscale's in June was a watershed moment for banks. She added that she isn't optimistic about SEC approval of the ETF in the near future but thinks that the $9-trillion-asset-under-management firm's filing, since it came from a traditional financial firm, was a signal to Wall Street that \"bitcoin is not going away.\"\n\n\"I am not expecting a positive decision on the ETF,\" Long said. \"But I think the punchline is everyone sees what's going on. Bitcoin did not go away. Now the regulators in Washington, D.C., are coming to the realization that they need to do something to create a regulated pathway for the industry. And if they don't do it, the courts are going to do it for them.\"\n\nCustodia is currently awaiting federal approval to custody bitcoin."

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here .\n\nDip in markets\n\nU.S. markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was flat, but major bourses dipped slightly and ended the day in the red. Germany's DAX lost 0.1% as new data showed the country's July exports dropping 0.9% on the month and 1% year on year, adding to fears about the German economy contracting in the third quarter.\n\n'Sick man of Europe'\n\nGermany is once again the \"sick man of Europe,\" said Hans-Werner Sinn, president emeritus at the Ifo institute. The country's business activity in August contracted sharply, according to the HCOB flash purchasing managers index. Moreover, Germany's plans to be carbon neutral by 2045 poses a risk to its industry, which might cause a \"backlash\" from the population, Sinn said.\n\nMissing Xi at G20\n\nPremier Li Qiang will lead China's delegation at the G20 summit in New Delhi this weekend, said China's foreign ministry. While the ministry declined to confirm if President Xi Jinping would attend the summit, spokesperson Mao Ning didn't correct reporters who asked if Li's attendance meant Xi would not show up. Another noteworthy absence: Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNegotiating new grain deal\n\nPutin met his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russia on Monday. Putin reportedly said Russia is ready to renew the Black Sea Grain Initiative which allowed Ukraine to export agricultural products \u2014 but only if concessions are made to Russia as well.\n\n[PRO] Don't sleep on these stocks\n\nAdults need seven to nine hours of sleep per day.

        "content": "Grayscale Investments is urging the SEC to approve its request to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF and has asked the agency to meet with them as quickly as possible after a court ruled against the agency's refusal to review Grayscale\u2019s application.\n\nThe crypto asset manager delivered a letter on Sept. 5 to the regulator urging it to approve the conversion of the $16 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe letter sent by Grayscale\u2019s lawyers argued that the filing to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF has been \u201cpending for nearly three times the length permitted\u201d for the SEC to act. It also sought to address security issues raised by the agency, saying that if safety differences between a spot bitcoin and currently available futures bitcoin ETFs existed, the firm is \u201cconfident it would have surfaced by now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no available rationale that would distinguish a bitcoin futures ETP from a spot bitcoin ETP,\u201d according to the letter sent by attorney Joseph Hall of New York\u2019s Davis Polk.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Court Victory Over SEC\n\nThe request follows Grayscale\u2019s watershed legal win over the agency on Aug. 29. The company had sued the SEC after the agency, which has to date not approved a spot bitcoin ETF, refused to permit the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit last month sided with Grayscale and called the SEC\u2019s decision \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has 45 days after the ruling to appeal.\n\nInvestment managers from BlackRock Inc. to Fidelity Investments have pending spot bitcoin ETF applications in front of the SEC. Approval of the Grayscale application would open the door to their spot bitcoin ETFs being available to investors.\n\nWhile the regulatory body allows ETFs that track bitcoin futures contracts, it thus far has blocked firms from rolling out ETFs that track physical bitcoin, which is the product investors are vying for.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) is by far the largest bitcoin futures ETF, which has $952 million in assets under management. The SEC has denied more than 30 spot bitcoin proposals since 2021.\n\n\u201cGBTC is ready to operate as an ETF upon regulatory approval, and Grayscale and its investors look forward to more information from the SEC,\u201d said a Grayscale spokesperson in the company\u2019s statement on the letter.\n\nSEC Meeting With Grayscale\n\nGrayscale is now seeking to meet with the SEC \u201cas soon as practical\u201d to \u201cdiscuss the way forward in view of recent developments,\u201d according to the letter.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson said the agency is \u201creviewing the next steps\u201d after the Grayscale lawsuit decision.\n\nGrayscale also argued that dragging out the approval process is hurting investors by pushing down the price of the trust. It also said that a spot bitcoin ETF is the least complicated and best product structure for bitcoin ETF investors.\n\nThe firm also said that its security measures, known as surveillance sharing agreements, handled by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are as effective as other firms\u2019 proposed agreements with Coinbase.\n\nGrayscale currently has one ETF, the Grayscale Future of Finance ETF (GFOF), which has $5.3 million in AUM.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "title": "Why cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are unlikely to disappear anytime soon - The Economic Times",
        "content": "I \u2019m sorry to say that Bitcoin has not been cancelled. After the FTX collapse, I had written that I was happy crypto had not been officially regulated in India. However, it\u2019s clear that apart from the taxation-based measures, there won\u2019t be a crypto ban in India, unlike, say, in China. This is fine. Crypto should not be regulated, and those who dabble in it should be left to their own devices. They should be free to go bankrupt in the manner and time they choose.At the same time, the FTX scam has not proven to be the death knell of crypto, something one could have hoped for. This implies that the cryptocurrency market may now be a permanent fixture in the global financial landscape . FTX has demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to attract billions from investors around the globe and squander it, and yet, fail to fundamentally challenge the underlying basis of cryptocurrency. The potential for profit is simply too great and too easy to attain. The prevailing opinion is that cryptocurrency is a valid asset class, and while there may be some regulatory hurdles, these will eventually be resolved. In time, another surge in value is inevitable, leading to a significant increase in the value of the surviving currencies and tokens. Consequently, a new wave of unsuspecting savers worldwide will jeopardise their finances. While many of the fringe cryptos have become irrelevant, Bitcoin has survived and has actually performed well enough for people to start getting fooled again. This year, for instance, despite the recent drops, Bitcoin is up 57%. In fact, from its low in November last year to its high in mid-July this year, Bitcoin has doubled.Any speculative asset that can randomly double and halve is well equipped to be exploited for luring newcomers. Clearly, this is the role that Bitcoin will play well from now onwards. Unfortunately, this could continue in the foreseeable future. Looking at the Bitcoin advocacy in social media, it becomes evident that the FTX crash and the post-FTX period have, in a somewhat paradoxical manner, benefited Bitcoin. The Bitcoin advocates\u2019 argument now is that if it has survived this, it will survive anything.At a rational level, it is not possible to refute this argument in a manner that will satisfy the surviving cryptomaniacs. To them, it\u2019s just the line of graph that matters. If someone\u2019s entire focus is on speculative trading without regard to the asset class, then Bitcoin serves perfectly well. In fact, it serves better than anything else because the more violent the gyrations of price, the more exciting the speculation. If something shoots up drastically and then falls as spectacularly, those who guess correctly will make that much more. This is like a drug to an addict. The crypto phenomenon cannot be understood without looking at the ordinary people who drive it. Some time ago, I read a book, Cryptostorm, written by business journalist Sundeep Khanna. It focuses almost entirely on people who got caught up in crypto. It\u2019s a very diverse set of people, with many defying our stereotypical image of cryptomaniacs.There\u2019s a small-town teacher, a hacker, a lawyer, and a student, among others. In many of these, one can see a yearning, a desire that if technology can create so many changes at such a fast pace, perhaps it can change money too. The entire crypto propaganda is based on inventing and exploiting this urge. Unfortunately for all these people, the rules of money and investing don\u2019t change. That\u2019s why this story will continue. Beyond criminal activities and ransomware, cryptocurrency is perfectly designed to take advantage of the savers, who lack the fundamental understanding about why some investments succeed and others seem too promising to be real. Human nature is invariably marked by greed, as well as the manipulation of this greed by others. That is not going to change.(The author is CEO, VALUE RESEARCH.)"

        "content": "Yeah, when I said that that would represent a five X increase in Bitcoin in only about a two year period does sound ridiculously bullish. Although there are others even more bullish than me. There are a lot of reasons that I offer this. Number one, we are beginning to see a sea change while we've been in the crypto winter for far longer than any of us want. And we've had massive amounts of fraud and abuse and cc enforcement actions, many of which have been justified. We are also beginning to see the turnaround of this. We're getting rid of the bad boys of crypto. Those crypto bros need to be gone. Many of them are the few remaining will soon be gone. And we're beginning to see the continued development of the technology, the further integration, the adoption and engagement at the institutional level, pension funds and other major institutions, endowments and such all engaging in crypto. We also see the sec major lawsuits ripple unis and now most recently gray scale, we are also seeing that over the next six months, we're going to be facing the next Bitcoin having, which historically has always been extraordinarily bullish for the price of Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin you earn as a miner gets cut in half that naturally calls for a price doubling for miners to keep their economic rewards intact. So all of these things are spelling really good news for crypto. Uh We're seeing legislation coming out of Congress. We're looking at stable coin adoption on a global basis. So all the signs are pointing really strong and if history is any guide as a result of the having by the summer of 25 I fully expect we'll see Bitcoin well into the low single digits. And even if I'm wrong and way wrong and Bitcoin merely doubles. Should me how any other investment has the potential of doing in the next 18 to 24 months? What crypto is the opportunity of doing? So it's a very exciting time for crypto. And that's why I wrote my white paper on what's happening with the ETF applications.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe SEC has labeled ADA, SOL, MATIC, and other cryptocurrencies as securities.\n\nThis labeling has been questioned in the light of the XRP case\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has been unofficially cleared of being a security.\n\nCCN spoke to legal experts to highlight the centralized nature of some tokens as key reasons for the SEC\u2019s scrutiny.\n\nLegal uncertainty continues to cloud several of the cryptocurrency ecosystem\u2019s most influential blockchains and respective tokens after high-profile enforcement actions from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe SEC has been a common feature of news headlines through 2023, with its decision to institute legal action against Binance.US and Coinbase raising concerns of far-reaching consequences for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nKey arguments laid out by the SEC against the two major exchange operators in the U.S. include allegations that many cryptocurrency tokens are deemed to be securities offerings. Both Binance.US and Coinbase are facing a raft of charges for allegedly operating as unregistered securities exchanges.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s allegations against Coinbase also list the likes of Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) as unregistered securities on the exchange, which had a marked effect on the value of these smart contract blockchain ecosystem tokens over the past few months.\n\nThe legal considerations are broad, with the SEC arguing that many cryptocurrency ecosystems and their tokens are securities and should fall under its remit. In having not registered with the agency, the likes of ADA, SOL, and MATIC have potentially fallen foul of its regulations.\n\nCCN reached out to legal experts to unpack how the SEC has approached Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency ecosystem and what makes BTC exempt from being classified as a security while other tokens are currently in the crosshairs of the U.S. watchdog.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s Stance on Bitcoin\n\nPreston Byrne has been advising technology companies on commercial law as a partner at BrownRudnick , with a keen focus on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. He tells CCN that the question of whether a token is a security or not is a legal consideration which depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding its creation and existence through the application of legal precedent.\n\nByrne notes that the only entity entitled to make this type of determination in a legally binding way is a U.S. judge or jury.\n\n\u201cThe SEC seems to have concluded, in my view correctly, that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t satisfy these criteria, as evidenced by the total absence of enforcement action in this area and some offhand remarks by then-SEC Chair Jay Clayton in 2018 and subsequently by current SEC Chair Gary Gensler,\u201d Byrne said.\n\nByrne says that despite the SEC not making any official judgments on Bitcoin itself, arguments that the preeminent cryptocurrency does not meet the criteria of the long-established Howey Test have seen the SEC lean towards this direction of classification.\n\n\u201cThe three-prong Howey test requires a finding that a contract, transaction, or scheme needs an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits arising from the efforts of others. There are colorable arguments for Bitcoin and indeed many other coins also that not all these elements are present.\u201d\n\nByrne adds that the SEC is taking a stern position on MATIC, SOL, and ADA in the Coinbase litigation. However, the judicial fact-finder, either a judge or jury, would be \u201cin the driver\u2019s seat\u201d in terms of deciding whether the U.S. exchange is operating an unregistered securities exchange or not.\n\nDavid Hoppe, the managing partner of Gamma Law , gave a more detailed breakdown of how Bitcoin does not fall within the scope of the SEC\u2019s Howey Test. He outlines the SEC\u2019s decision to not deem Bitcoin as a security based on the Howey Test based on four factors:\n\nAn investment of money. In a common enterprise. With a reasonable expectation of profits To be derived from the efforts of others.\n\nHoppe notes the SEC concluded that Bitcoin did not meet the second factor, reasoning that Bitcoin is not a common enterprise because it is not managed by a central authority but by a decentralized network controlled by its users.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not a financial investment. It is not a claim on the future profits of a company or project. Bitcoin is not sold with the expectation of profits from the efforts of others. Its value is determined by supply and demand, not by the efforts of developers or manager,\u201d Hoppe said.\n\nWhy are ADA, SOL, and MATIC under fire?\n\nHaving outlined why the SEC does not view Bitcoin as a securities offering, Hoppe then touched on the agency\u2019s view on other tokens perceived to be securities.\n\nThe SEC has not publicly stated the specific criteria it uses to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security, but Hoppe put forward three factors that the agency is using to make these determinations.\n\nHoppe notes that the level of centralized control is one aspect. Where Bitcoin is decentralized in nature, other tokens are managed by a core team.\n\n\u201cThis is in contrast to other cryptocurrencies, such as MATIC and SOL (at least), which are arguably controlled by central development teams or large holders,\u201d Hoppe said.\n\nThe purpose of a cryptocurrency is another consideration for the SEC. Given that Bitcoin was created as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, BTC was not intended to be held for capital appreciation, which Byrne suggests is at odds with tokens under SEC scrutiny.\n\n\u201cMATIC, SOL, and ADA are all designed to be used in decentralized applications, but arguably intended to provide a capital appreciation opportunity.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the SEC has taken the position that the marketing of a cryptocurrency can be a factor in determining whether it is a security. If a cryptocurrency is marketed as an investment, then it is more likely to be considered a security.\n\nSEC Taking Advantage of U.S Crypto Legal Stance\n\nFrom a legal perspective, there is consensus that Bitcoin is not judged to be a security. However, the status of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, which features a plethora of tokens operating on a variety of multi-purpose blockchains, is not so clear cut.\n\nByrne believes that SEC has been forthcoming about the logic behind its recent enforcement actions against the likes of Coinbase, Binance.US as well as the ongoing Ripple/XRP court case.\n\nThis is despite not providing more detailed information about how the likes of ADA, SOL and MATIC have been ruled as unregistered securities.\n\n\u201cIts reasoning is fairly clear. The SEC waited a very long time to take the position it did regarding altcoins and exchanges \u2013 roughly 10 years \u2013 but the interpretation they have adopted is one which was within their power to adopt,\u201d Byrne said.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoppe says the SEC could have been more forthcoming with its reasoning behind its decisions to label a number of tokens as securities in recent lawsuits. However, there are reasons why there has been a perceived lack of regularity clarity from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\n\u201cThe nature of cryptocurrency is still evolving. Cryptocurrency is a relatively new technology and business model, and its legal status is still being debated. This makes it difficult for regulators to develop clear rules for the sector,\u201d Hoppe said.\n\nHe also notes that the global nature of the cryptocurrency market makes it difficult for regulators to coordinate efforts and develop consistent rules. From a U.S. perspective, Hoppe says that the SEC and CFTC have different views on how to regulate cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has taken a more aggressive approach to regulating cryptocurrency, while the CFTC has taken a more hands-off approach. This has led to confusion and uncertainty in the market.\u201d\n\nThis has led to a number of challenges for the cryptocurrency sector. Instances of crypto-related companies struggling to raise capital and list their tokens on exchanges is a prime example.\n\nSigns of Change\n\nWhile the U.S. cryptocurrency ecosystem has expressed fears that regulatory oversight in the country will drive businesses abroad and negatively effect the industry, Hoppe anticipates clearer regulatory guidelines for in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe SEC and CFTC have been working on developing regulations for cryptocurrency, and there is a growing consensus among regulators that a regulatory framework needs to be developed for cryptocurrency in order to provide clarity for companies in the space, protect investors and reduce the risk of fraud,\u201d Hoppe said.\n\nHoppe added that the SEC could be more forthcoming with the industry to address repeated concerns. This could be done by providing more detailed explanations of its reasoning in its lawsuits, publishing guidance on how to comply with securities laws for cryptocurrency companies as well as holding public hearings on the regulation of cryptocurrency.\n\nThis would allow the SEC to hear from a variety of stakeholders and to get feedback on its proposed regulations."

        "content": "The state of crypto is presented by Tron connecting the world to the power of Cryptocurrency. JP Morgan. Analysts predict more likely that the SEC will be forced to approve the spot Bitcoin ETF applications from several asset managers after a federal court ruled that the regulator must review its rejection of grey scales attempt to convert the great scale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Joining us now to discuss is the founder of Digital Assets Council of Finance Financial Professionals, Rick Adelman. Welcome to the show. Rick. Great to be with you. Thanks, great to have you here this morning. Now, we've been talking about ETF S uh what, what feels like forever. Um And while we, we've had some developments, it feels like we've had none. So I'm so happy you're here with us this morning to kind of unpack uh what might happen next? Let's talk about your white paper. You recently wrote a white paper called, what you need to know about spot Bitcoin ETF S. Tell us what you think. Uh we need to know what are the important points here. Well, this is uh you know, referring to the, the gray scale lawsuit which uh the SEC lost. This is probably the most bullish signal for crypto in years, but we mustn't get too far ahead of ourselves. Uh Although uh everyone in the crypto community is very excited about the fact that gray scale won the lawsuit, which frankly was widely expected because the S ECs position was absurd. The court did not take the SEC to approve of the spot coin ETF applications. That's not what the court said. The court said that what the SEC did is unreasonable uh was arbitrary and capricious and simply said that it must vacate its prior decision. So what does that leave us? Well, we're all expecting that as a result of the lawsuit, the SEC is going to approve the spot Bitcoin ETF applications gray scales as well as nine other applications that are pending before the SEC. Um But that isn't necessarily what the SEC might do. Gary Gusler still remains very opposed to crypto and he seems to have it in for Bitcoin in particular. Uh And so he may do any one of a number of other things. Uh then he may uh appeal the ruling. He's got 45 days to make that decision. Uh If that happens, we're going to go through months, maybe even years of another legal process. Uh The SEC may uh stall uh as they did this past week. Uh right before the, the holiday uh in the US, we uh had the SEC kick the can on the bit wise applications and several others giving them an extra 240 days to make a decision as to what they're going to do here. Uh Third, the SEC could act yes and say, well, ok, fine. Can't say no to gray scale. Then we're gonna tell gray scale to ref file their application. That won't, that's not an approval that's starting the clock over again. And it could take another six months to a year for that process to go through. And finally the SEC could do something that I think a lot of folks are not really talking about the SCC could take the court literally, Jen, the, the court told the SEC that you, that you can't say yes to futures ETS and no to spot ETS. That's kind of like saying you can eat ketchup, but you can't eat tomatoes. It makes no sense. Futures are derivatives. So how can you say yes to the derivative without saying yes to the underlying asset. And that's why the court said no good. Well, the SEC could take the court literally and say, well, if we can't say no to the spot, we'll also say no to the futures and they could pull the futures ETF s off the market, which is the exact opposite of what anybody would ever suspect the SEC to do. So there's a lot of things the SEC could do that are not equating yes to the spot ETF S. So while there's a lot of optimism and I share the optimism that we're going to see the spot ETF applications approved. Let's not get carried away into thinking that that's the only course of action the SEC may take that last point you brought up. There was one of the most interesting points in your notes as I was going through them. What's the likelihood that the SEC comes back and says actually, this Bitcoin futures ETF is going to be rescinded and not allowed in the US anymore. I think it's really low. It's very rare for the SEC to pull a product off the market, especially when you want a product that has been operating perfectly fine, especially now that it has a massive amount of assets in it. The disruption in the both the crypto and financial communities would be massive, the outcry would be huge. It would clearly be demonstrating that that Gary Gentler is operating in a manner that is not in the best interest of investors, uh or the uh industry. So I find it very unlikely, but Gary Gs has done some pretty dramatic things over the past couple of years that are unsustainable, unsupportable. He's gotten thumped by the courts many times ripple now, gray scale, it's expected he'll lose the coin based lawsuit. Uh And uh so it's unlikely but, you know, look at the ripple lawsuit instead of saying, ok, I lost, I'll do what the court said gentler is appealing the decision. Uh So it's hard to say what he'll do, Rick. I got to get your opinion on this. Bloomberg, senior ETF analyst, Eric Walsh said on the Unchained podcast that exchanges like coin base will suffer when the SEC finally approves a spot. Bitcoin ETF S. Do you agree with that? Yes and no. Uh I certainly see the argument and I think, um, it will reduce coin base's business volume. Um Let's, let's put it this way. The overwhelming majority of investment advisor, we're talking 77% say that they are not investing in crypto. They're not recommending it for their clients without the uh existence of an ETF. So when the ETF comes into the market, those advisers are going to be recommending the ETF, they're not gonna be recommending that their clients open Coinbase accounts. So in that sense, people who are currently going to Coinbase and Gemini and crack in and other platforms to uh obtain their crypto are going to turn to the ETF instead because the ETF is so much easier, so much more convenient, so much more liquid lower in cost. Uh high transparency. This is why ETF S are the favorite investment vehicle on the planet for all of those investment opportunities and benefits. So people who are currently buying crypto in other, more cumbersome, more complicated, more expensive ways are going to abandon those and go to the ETF. That's bad news for exchanges uh like coin base. But on the other hand, let's remember something really important. This new spot, Bitcoin ETF is only Bitcoin. It isn't ether, it isn't solana, it isn't polygon, it isn't anything but Bitcoin. And eventually people are going to remember that portfolio diversification is what really matters. Owning only Bitcoin is not necessarily the end all so long term, this could work out well for, for a coin base, as people realize, oh, I do want to have access to other coins and tokens and I can't get that in this Bitcoin. Ef that would mean that we're using the Bitcoin ETF as a foot in the door. This is your first journey down that rabbit hole and it could actually spell good news for the exchanges as investors look for broader ways to engage in the crypto space. So I agree with this point that in the short run, it may hurt coin base but longer term, I think it legitimizes uh Coinbase existence. Uh On that note, there is a report that came out of Bernstein that said, quote, the crypto ETF opportunity won't stop at just Bitcoin but will extend into multiple crypto assets. We of course have the Ether futures. ETF um on the books right now, waiting for an sec approval or denial. Do you see ETF S kind of spanning into other crypto assets that will as well will ETF S become the norm? There's no question. This is just the very beginning. And that's why this is such an exciting moment, not just for Bitcoin, but for crypto broadly, uh this is gonna be a rising tide scenario. Uh And it's great news across the board for Bitcoin or coins and tokens for the platforms and exchanges for the uh S ma separately managed accounts for the Ira custodians that allow you to buy crypto in your ira. This is great news for everybody everywhere. So, yeah, this is just the beginning and maybe this is why Ginzler has been so reticent to say yes to anything because he, he's opposed to this slippery slope. Uh And while we see it as a RS tide, he sees it as a downward problem. Uh But yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I think Bernstein is right on the money and we're going to see in the future that this will be remembered as the initial uh movement into the market place. And it is by far going to be the only one rick before we go. I have to ask you about a webinar. You did last month. You were reportedly predicted that Bitcoin would be in the neighborhood of 100 and $50,000 by the summer of 2025. Talk to me about what went into that prediction um and what needs to happen for us to get there. It seems like a far shot away from the markets check we did at the beginning of the show. Yeah, when I said that that would represent a five X increase in Bitcoin in only about a two year period does sound ridiculously bullish. Although there are others even more bullish than me. There are a lot of reasons that I offer this. Number one, we are beginning to see a sea change while we've been in the crypto winter for far longer than any of us want. And we've had NASA amounts of fraud and abuse and SCC enforcement actions, many of which have been justified. We are also beginning to see the turnaround of this. We're getting rid of the bad boys of crypto. Those crypto bros need to be gone. Many of them are the few remaining will soon be gone. And we're beginning to see the continued development of the technology, the further integration, the adoption and engagement at the institutional level pension funds and other major institutions, endowments and such all engaging in crypto. We also see the sec losing major lawsuits, ripple unis and now most recently gray scale, we are also seeing that over the next six months, we're going to be facing the next Bitcoin having, which historically has always been extraordinarily bullish for the price of Bitcoin as the number of Bitcoin you earn as a miner gets cut in half. That naturally calls for a price doubling for miners to keep their economic words intact. So all of these things are spelling really good news for crypto uh we're seeing legislation coming out of Congress, we're looking at stable coin adoption on a global basis. So all the signs are pointing really strong. And if history is any guide as a result of the having by the summer of 25 I fully expect we'll see Bitcoin well into the low single digits. And even if I'm wrong and way wrong and Bitcoin merely doubles, show me how any other investment has the potential of doing in the next 18 to 24 months. What crypto is the opportunity of doing? So? It's a very exciting time for crypto. And that's why I wrote my white paper on what's happening with the spot ETF applications. Uh Why I wrote my book, The Truth About crypto and why we offer our certificate program so you can become certified in Blockchain and digital assets, all of that available at DFP dot com. All right, Rick, we're gonna have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining the show this morning. It was a pleasure chatting any time Jen, that was the founder of Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, Rick Adelman. Before we go, we shipped out that coin desk and gray scale are both owned by digital currency group."

Ether dipped to near the US$1,600 mark, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP posted the biggest gains while Solana led the losers. Digital asset investment products saw a minor outflow last week accompanied by a surge in trading volumes, indicating mixed sentiment among institutional investors. U.S. stock futures traded mixed ahead of regular trading following the long holiday weekend.\n\nBitcoin below US$26,000\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.57% in the last 24 hours to US$25,804.63 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 1.15%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency had been trading in the US$26,000 range since Friday. It briefly breached US$28,000 last Tuesday as an apparent victory for Grayscale Investment against the U.S. Securties and Exchange Commission boosted sentiment. That optimism has now cooled.\n\nEther dipped 0.49% to US$1,627.26, losing 1.58% over the past seven days.\n\nThe crypto market is suffering from regulatory uncertainties in the U.S., said Samer Hasn, market analyst for online brokerage XS.com, in an emailed comment. He also noted the effect of large transactions on the market, including a US$213 million XRP transaction and a US$37 million Shiba Inu transaction recorded over the weekend.\n\n\u201cAlthough the reasons behind the series of huge transfers that we are witnessing in the cryptocurrency market are not yet completely clear, I believe that they may continue to fuel a state of anticipation and caution in the markets, especially since these transfers come amid weak sentiment among market participants, with the continuing battle in the judicial arena in the United States,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nMeanwhile, Binance\u2019s global head of product Mayur Kamat resigned from the company, Reuters reported on Monday. The world\u2019s largest crypto exchange faces lawsuits from the U.S. SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as an investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nStory continues\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, with movement within the 1% range across the board. XRP led the winners with a 0.61% gain to US$0.5082, but remained 3.01% lower for the week.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw a minor outflow of US$11.2 million in the week ending Sept. 1. That was a slowdown from US$168 million last week, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Despite the small outflow, digital investment products\u2019 trading volume totaled US$2.8 billion, a 90% rise on the year-to-date average.\n\n\u201cThe recent minor outflows from digital asset funds may be due to uncertainty around the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 following an initial surge of enthusiasm upon their announcement,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, it will be interesting to see how these regulatory uncertainties are balanced,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event will see the amount of new tokens issued every 10 minutes cut in half, increasing its scarcity. This is widely anticipated to produce a surge in the token\u2019s price. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024.\n\nElsewhere, crypto exchange Bybit introduced TradeGPT on Monday \u2014 an artificial intelligence-powered education tool that uses ChatGPT to generate market analysis and answer technical questions based on Bybit\u2019s real-time market data. Other crypto exchanges including Binance, Crypto.com and OKX also launched A.I.-powered analyzing tools earlier this year.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.56% to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 20.65% to US$23.77 billion.\n\nU.S. stock futures dip; China services activity slows\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading lower ahead of the opening bell Tuesday after a holiday-extended weekend for markets. Despite closing mixed on Friday, all three major U.S. indexes posted weekly gains, with Friday\u2019s jobs data easing rate hike worries.\n\nAll the main stock indexes across Asia were showing losses as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nChina\u2019s release of key economic data Tuesday morning cast a cloud over markets. The Caixin China services purchasing managers index (PMI) \u2014 a private gauge of the business activities in the country\u2019s service industry \u2014 dropped from 54.1 in July to 51.8 in August, the lowest level in the past eight months. A PMI reading above 50 indicates a growth in business activities, while a sub-50 reading indicates a contraction.\n\nThe PMI report followed an unexpected expansion in China\u2019s manufacturing industry on September 1. But a slowdown of growth in the services industry provides more evidence of a wider economic downturn.\n\n\u201cThe marginal slowdown in the services sector\u2019s supply and demand expansion offset the improvement in manufacturing production and demand,\u201d Wang Zhe, an economist at Caixin Insight Group, told Reuters. \u201cThere was still considerable downward pressure on the economy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Japan\u2019s manufacturing PMI rose from 53.8 in July to 54.3 in August \u2014 the highest reading in three months, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA stronger improvement in new orders received by Japanese service firms underpinned an acceleration in business activity growth,\u201d Usamah Bhatti, an economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Reuters. \u201cThat said, service providers signalled a steeper increase in inflationary pressures during August.\u201d\n\nInvestors now await a decision on interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia expected later Tuesday. Analysts expect the country\u2019s central bank to keep the rate unchanged at 4.10% for the third straight month, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Reserve will meet on Sept. 20 to make its next move on interest rates, which are currently between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in 22 years.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the Fed will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 78% on August 28.\n\nFurther indication of how the Fed\u2019s plan for rates will arrive with a series of official speeches on Thursday. Elsewhere, S&P will release its U.S. services purchasing manager index (PMI) for August on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) price correction down to $22,000 is becoming increasingly likely, as BTC derivatives have begun to exhibit bearish tendencies.\n\nThe price chart of Bitcoin leaves little doubt that investor sentiment has worsened since Grayscale\u2019s much-hyped legal victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 29 and the SEC\u2019s subsequent postponement of multiple spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) requests.\n\nThe central question remains whether the prospects of an ETF can outweigh the growing risks.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF hype is fading\n\nBy Aug. 18, the entire 19% rally that occurred following BlackRock's ETF initial filing had fully retracted as Bitcoin moved back to $26,000\n\nNext, there was a failed attempt to reclaim the $28,000 support as investors raised the odds of an ETF approval following the positive news regarding Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust request.\n\nBitcoin/USD price index, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nCryptocurrency investors\u2019 morale deteriorated as the S&P 500 index closed at 4,515 on Sept. 1, merely 6.3% below its all-time high from January 2022. Even gold, which hasn\u2019t been able to break above the $2,000 level since mid-May, is 6.5% away from its all-time high. Consequently, the general feeling for Bitcoin investors just seven months ahead of its halving in 2024 is certainly less positive than expected.\n\nSome analysts pin Bitcoin\u2019s lackluster performance on the ongoing regulatory actions against the two leading exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Moreover, multiple sources claim that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is likely to indict Binance in a criminal probe. The claims are based on allegations of money laundering and potential violations of sanctions involving Russian entities.\n\nRelated: Weekly close risks BTC price \u2018double top\u2019 \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nNorth Node Capital chief investment officer and Bitcoin supporter Pentoshi expressed the current conditions in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter):\n\nI think we still will eventually get some bearish Binance news vs DoJ. That should be seen as opportunity!\n\n\n\nBut overall. We also likely get ETF\u2019s this year or early next year and $btc heading to 401k\u2019s\n\n\n\nSaid it before but this is a year for accumulation. Don\u2019t lose sight of the\u2026 \u2014 Pentoshi euroPeng (@Pentosh1) September 1, 2023\n\nAccording to Pentoshi, the potential gains from a spot ETF approval outweigh the price impact of regulatory actions against the exchanges. There\u2019s no way to ascertain whether such an assumption is valid, but such an analysis fails to consider that U.S. inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has come down to 3.2% in July 2023 from 9.1% in June 2022.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s total assets have been reduced to $8.12 trillion, down from the recent $8.73 peak in March 2023. This signals that the monetary authority has been draining liquidity from the markets, which is detrimental to Bitcoin\u2019s inflation protection thesis.\n\nLooking at a longer time frame, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been holding the $25,000 level since mid-March, but taking a closer look at derivatives data shows that bulls\u2019 conviction is getting tested.\n\nBitcoin derivatives show decreasing demand from bulls\n\nBitcoin monthly futures typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin one-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current 3.5% futures premium (basis rate) is at its lowest point since mid-June, prior to BlackRock\u2019s filing for a spot ETF. This indicator reflects a decreased demand for leverage buyers utilizing derivatives contracts.\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become less optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, the options\u2019 25% delta skew has recently entered bearish territory, with protective put (sell) options trading at a 9% premium on Sept. 4 compared with similar call (buy) options.\n\nBTC futures hint at $22,000 next\n\nBitcoin derivatives data suggests that the bearish momentum is gaining strength, especially since the approval of a spot ETF could potentially be deferred until 2024, given the SEC\u2019s concerns about the lack of measures to prevent a significant portion of trading occurring on unregulated offshore exchanges based on stablecoins.\n\nMeanwhile, the uncertainty in the regulatory landscape does favor the bears, as there\u2019s no way to dismiss the fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding potential actions from the DOJ or the ongoing lawsuits against exchanges by the SEC.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF applications: Who is filing and when the SEC may decide\n\nUltimately, a retracement down to $22,000 \u2014 the level last seen when Bitcoin\u2019s futures premium was 3.5% \u2014 is the most likely scenario, considering the recent inability to sustain a positive price momentum despite the heightened chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "The Solana logo on a phone screen and representation of cryptocurrencies are seen in this photo taken in Krakow, Poland, Aug. 21, 2021.\n\nThe native token of the Solana blockchain jumped Tuesday after Visa announced it will expand its stablecoin capabilities to the Ethereum alternative.\n\nSolana's sol token was last higher by 4.39% at $20.25, according to Coin Metrics. At one point it rose as much as 6%. Other cryptocurrencies were little changed, with bitcoin hovering below the flat line at $25,803.25 and ether up slightly at $1,640.06.\n\nThe move came after Visa announced it will introduce settlement of the USDC stablecoin over the Solana network. The payments giant said in a statement that the development could help \"improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa's treasury.\"\n\nSolana is one of several networks aiming to rival Ethereum. It's loved among developers, who may choose to build applications on it instead of Ethereum because of its speed and cost effectiveness. It's year-to-date gain is one of the biggest in the crypto market at 101%.\n\nThe announcement follows the launch of PayPal's company-branded stablecoin, PayPal USD. The company said the function of PayPal USD is to reduce friction for in-experience payments in virtual settings and allow direct flows to developers.\n\nVisa has been experimenting with USDC, the second-largest stablecoin in the market, since 2021, exploring how it could be used inside its treasury operations to make currency conversion in cross-border payments shorter and cheaper.\n\nBernstein has called stablecoins the \"monster killer app\" for crypto, identifying them as a nearly $3 trillion market over the next five years.\n\n\"We expect major global financial and consumer platforms to issue co-branded stablecoins to power value exchange on their platforms,\" Bernstein said. \"Going forward, we expect tokenized stablecoins to be a $2.8 trillion market, led by regulated, onshore stablecoins.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin and crypto are about to embark on a 'much stronger fundamental' rally, Bernstein predicts - CNBC",
        "content": "The setup for the next bitcoin bull run has become even clearer after last week's landmark ruling in Grayscale's suit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delivered what Bernstein calls a \"game changer\" for asset managers. This time, however, it will be led by institutions rather than retail investors, which helps explain why crypto prices remain stagnant despite having several positive catalysts in recent weeks. \"The strong showing in the courts (Ripple and Grayscale in two months), improved ETF chances and the progressive institutional interest are positioning crypto for an unprecedented institution capital led cycle, unlike the retail led crypto cycles of the past,\" Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani said in a note Monday. \"This is a cycle slower to take off, but is being laid on much stronger fundamental grounds of regulatory clarity and more strategic long-term players entering the space.\" Last week, bitcoin rallied more than 7% after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the SEC was wrong to deny crypto investment giant Grayscale permission to convert its popular bitcoin trust, known by its ticker GBTC , into an exchange-traded fund. The rally failed to hold, however, and by the time the SEC had delayed its decisions on the first spot bitcoin ETFs two days later, bitcoin had given up all of its gains from the news. BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin is back to hovering under the $26,000 level. \"The existing crypto market remains a low liquidity market, with limited new capital entering the space. As a result, traders position around events and sell the good news,\" Chhugani wrote. \"The lack of follow through in the market should not be interpreted as lack of progress towards a new capitalization cycle.\" Investors remain optimistic about the recent developments and what they could mean for the crypto market over the long term, however. The ruling is just one step forward, but could open the door to the approval of the first bitcoin ETF in the U.S., ushering in a wave of new demand for the digital asset. However, it's unlikely to free the market from the regulatory uncertainty that has pressured it all year. Specifically, the details of the ruling show that the SEC would have to find a new reason to deny these applications again. The agency for years has maintained that various attempts at a bitcoin ETF didn't satisfy concerns about fraud and manipulation in the market. The ruling shot that down, noting that \"bitcoin futures prices are ultimately based on spot market prices.\" Several bitcoin futures ETFs have been green-lit to launch. \"Thus, we believe, the crypto industry will get its first Bitcoin ETF between mid October and mid March 2024 (the scheduled review dates),\" Chhugani said, adding that it probably won't stop there and could open up a \"massive commercial opportunity\" for asset managers \"to generate fees (at healthy rates 50-75 bps) for a growing asset class.\" \"The industry push for Ethereum spot ETF follows immediately after, given ETH also has a similar market structure of a traded CME futures market ( > 2 years) and a spot market,\" he added. \"In fact, the asset management industry would push beyond BTC, ETH into areas [such as] top blockchains (Solana, Polygon etc) and even extend into segments such as leading DeFi assets.\" \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "Bitcoin was trading flat below the resistance level of US$26,000 Wednesday morning in Asia. Ether edged up but remained below the US$1,650 mark, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Solana led the winners after Visa announced it would expand stablecoin payments to the Solana network. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after a down day Tuesday. Oil supply restrictions from Russia and Saudi Arabia have aroused inflationary concerns and fear among investors of more U.S. interest rate hikes to come.\n\nSolana surges on Visa partnership\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.01% in the last 24 hours to US$25,764.10 as of 07:10 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 6.72%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has been trading between US$25,500 and US$26,000 since Saturday. It was trading at the same range in June before U.S. investment giant BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application sent the price over US$30,000\n\n\u201cThe market seems to underestimate the potential impact of U.S. BTC spot ETFs. A spot ETF approval should attract enormous inflows, creating significant buying pressure on BTC. Conversely, if the BTC spot ETFs are rejected, nothing changes,\u201d wrote crypto research firm K33 Research in a report Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPrices are now the same as before the Blackrock news that injected new life into BTC spot ETF chances. In the same time span, the Nasdaq 100, often a good indicator of the market\u2019s general risk appetite, is up 2%. The BTC spot ETFs will be huge, and with improved odds of approval, it looks evident that the market is mispricing it,\u201d the report continued.\n\nDigital asset manager Grayscale Investments sent a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Tuesday urging the regulator to approve its application to turn the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. That followed a favorable court decision on August 29 for the digital asset management firm requiring the SEC to review an application it rejected last year.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cGBTC is ready to operate as a bitcoin ETF upon regulatory approval, and Grayscale looks forward to further constructive engagement with the SEC,\u201d said Grayscale in a Twitter thread on Tuesday.\n\n$GBTC is ready to operate as a #bitcoinETF upon regulatory approval, and Grayscale looks forward to further constructive engagement with the SEC. Find out more on our website: https://t.co/0vKXOQGcec (3/3) \u2014 Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 5, 2023\n\nJustin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock, said the resubmission of Grayscale\u2019s request to the SEC for their ETF approval is a reason for optimism. \u201cAgain, the arrival of a crypto-linked ETF seems to become more and more likely, although the timeline itself remains iffy,\u201d he said.\n\nEthereum gained 0.51% to US$1,631.79, down 5.53% for the past seven days. The second largest cryptocurrency has been trading around US$1,640 since the weekend. But K33 analysts said they expect the token\u2019s price to rise in the near future.\n\n\u201cSeptember and October favor overweight exposure in ETH, as ETH carry stronger ETF momentum in the short term,\u201d wrote K33 in Tuesday\u2019s report. \u201cFutures-based ETH ETFs are scheduled to receive their final verdicts in mid-October, with strong chances of approval.\u201d\n\nNearly a dozen companies including Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares have filed to launch Ethereum ETFs in the U.S.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours. Solana\u2019s SOL led the winners, rising 4.43% to US$20.22 but still posted a loss of 7.19% for the week.\n\nVisa Inc. announced on Tuesday it would expand its USDC stablecoin settlement services to the Solana blockchain. The global payments giant has been supporting USDC settlements on the Ethereum blockchain since March 2021.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we\u2019re helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa\u2019s treasury,\u201d Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said in the announcement.\n\nSolana said in a tweet Tuesday that Visa\u2019s addition of the blockchain to its payment network follows an extensive period of planning and infrastructure evaluation.\n\n1/\ud83c\udfe6Breaking: Visa Expands Stablecoin Settlement Pilot to Solana@Visa is scaling their USDC settlement pilot to include the Solana blockchain, enabling enterprise-grade throughput at virtually no cost for Visa issuers and merchant acquirers on Solana. https://t.co/rF5ouZaISM \u2014 Solana (@solana) September 5, 2023\n\n\u201cThe partnership between Solana and Visa is a positive development for the blockchain ecosystem,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cIt broadens the range of use-cases beyond just Ethereum-based applications. Additionally, Solana offers faster and more cost-effective transactions which makes it a great option for settling transactions internally,\u201d Stefanidis said.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase launched a new crypto lending platform for U.S. institutional investors on September 1. The platform has raised over US$57 million in investment, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made Friday.\n\nThe platform\u2019s launch follows the bankruptcies of major crypto lenders including Celsius Network, BlockFi and Genesis Global. Those collapses opened up a vacuum in crypto lending services that the new Coinbase platform could come to occupy.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.15% to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 5.55% to US$25.05 billion.\n\nOil prices up; Goldman Sachs lowers US recession estimate\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading mixed as of 09:40 a.m. in Asia. The Dow edged higher, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged losses. All three major U.S. indexes closed lower on Tuesday. The Dow led the losses with a 0.56% drop.\n\nThe main stock indexes across Asia mostly posted losses. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi moved lower, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose by 0.58%.\n\nThe benchmark Brent Crude Oil price reached a high of US$90.38 per barrel on Tuesday, the highest price since November 2022. The rise came after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their unilateral oil supply cuts by three months to the end of the year, contributing to the declines in the Asia equity market.\n\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs on Tuesday lowered its estimation for a U.S. economic recession in the next 12 months from 20% to 15%. The figure is much lower than a Bloomberg analyst consensus of 60%. The Goldman Sachs report cited continued positive inflation and strong labor market data as the reasons for its improved outlook.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC that \u201ca hell of a good week of data\u201d for August, including a better-than-expected jobs report, points to a slowdown in inflation. But he said it is still too early to tell if the Fed is done with its monetary tightening policies.\n\n\u201cI want to be very careful about saying we\u2019ve kind of done the job on inflation until we see a couple of months continuing along this trajectory before I say we\u2019re done doing anything,\u201d Waller said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think one more hike would necessarily throw the economy into recession if we did feel that we needed to do one,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious that we\u2019re in real danger of doing a lot of damage to the job market, even if we raise rates one more time.\u201d\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was more hawkish. She said in an interview with German news outlet B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung Tuesday that the Fed \u201cmight have to go a bit higher\u201d in its policy rates to handle a still high level of demand in the economy.\n\nThe Fed will meet on Sept. 20 to make its next move on interest rates, which are currently between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in 22 years.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the Fed will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, down from 94% on Sept. 1. It also gives a 41.3% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike in November, up from 33.5% on Sept. 1.\n\n\u201cFed officials are unlikely to move quickly toward easier policy unless growth slows more than we are forecasting in coming quarters,\u201d said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, in a Tuesday research note viewed by Bloomberg. \u201cWe therefore expect only very gradual cuts of 25-bps per quarter starting in 2024Q2.\u201d\n\nA series of official speeches Thursday will provide further indication of the Fed\u2019s plan for rates. Elsewhere, S&P will release its U.S. services purchasing manager index (PMI) for August later Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Crypto veteran VC predicts 10-20x Bitcoin growth fueled by utility surge - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Jason Fang, founder of cryptocurrency investment firm Sora Ventures, recently offered unique perspectives on market trends and Bitcoin\u2019s untapped potential, drawn from his firsthand experience across multiple crypto cycles.\n\nFang highlighted how quickly the crypto market can pivot, noting that DeFi and NFT mania went mainstream within two years despite early skepticism. Fang believes Bitcoin development is progressing faster than many realize and will similarly surprise skeptics.\n\nRecalling the past bear markets, Fang described how the Bitcoin price plunged, and his fund dropped 80% at one point, an atypical story in crypto that year. However, Fang managed to survive as a part of only a \u201chandful\u201d of other \u2018web3\u2019 funds in Asia at the time.\n\nHowever, Fang expressed conviction in Bitcoin\u2018s resilience and indicated the panacea to its volatility, saying, \u201cIf Bitcoin goes to zero, then the entire Web3 industry goes to zero.\u201d He contrasted Bitcoin\u2019s battle-tested network to newer chains like Solana and Avalanche that haven\u2019t experienced a bear market.\n\nFrom its foundations, Fang sees Bitcoin at over $200,000 achieved through increased on-chain utility as he compared Bitcoin to Ethereum in 2017. With Bitcoin having a limited dApp ecosystem today versus Ethereum having similar numbers back when it was $80, he believes a 10-20x Bitcoin price gain is achievable as Bitcoin utility grows.\n\nIn the interview, Fang elaborated on specific areas where he expects to see expanded utility built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nHe pointed to the development of BRC-20 tokens as a major area of interest and excitement, especially in Asian crypto communities. Fang believes the first major BRC-20 project successfully launched and listed on top exchanges would spark tremendous interest and further development.\n\nBeyond tokens, Fang sees parallels to Ethereum in Bitcoin\u2019s ability to mimic many of the same decentralized finance and NFT use cases, albeit built with different technical stacks. He emphasized that while the path will diverge from Ethereum, Bitcoin will ultimately be capable of delivering similar utility to users.\n\nOverall, Fang\u2019s perspective highlights the breadth of potential he sees in Bitcoin to move far beyond just a store of value into a thriving ecosystem for new blockchain-based applications.\n\nWho is Jason Fang?\n\nFang\u2019s early exposure to entrepreneurship began in college, where he started an \u201cUber for tutoring\u201d platform despite having no formal computer science education. Driven to build his idea, Fang taught himself to code over several months.\n\nAfter graduation, Fang joined Fenbushi Capital, an early cryptocurrency venture capital firm where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin was also involved. This opportunity introduced Fang to the emerging world of blockchain technology and crypto assets.\n\nIn 2017, Fang founded Sora Ventures and began investing in Ethereum-based tokens and projects. However, when the crypto bear market hit in 2018, the value of Sora\u2019s investments dropped 80%, while many other crypto funds folded at the time, as mentioned previously.\n\nDespite this setback, Fang persevered by buying out dissatisfied investors to give Sora more time to recoup losses. He also made prudent exits during the following bull market. Thanks to Fang\u2019s persistence and strategic moves, Sora emerged in a strong position coming out of the bear market years.\n\nIn 2023, Sora has pivoted to focus heavily on Bitcoin investments, becoming the most active institutional investor in Bitcoin startups year to date. The firm led a $3 million investment in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s new crypto fund and sponsored the Bitcoin Startup Lab hackathon with $50,000, the largest Bitcoin hackathon prize this year.\n\nWhen asked why he is so optimistic about Bitcoin, Fang said he sees \u201chuge potential as it gets more developers and apps built on top of it, like Ethereum has.\u201d He believes Bitcoin\u2019s price could easily explode from today\u2019s levels as utility expands.\n\nFang advises new Bitcoin entrepreneurs that \u201cBitcoin will be a big game changer in the next wave. The use cases now are just the beginning.\u201d He encourages visionaries to get involved early and build the next generation of Bitcoin applications.\n\nFang\u2019s undeterred spirit after setbacks, sharp strategic pivots, and proactive investments in the Bitcoin ecosystem offer invaluable lessons for newcomers. His personal journey typifies the grit required to drive innovation on emerging technologies like Bitcoin.\n\nDisclosure: Sora Ventures is an investor in CryptoSlate."

While we factored Grayscale win into our prev 65% odds, the unanimity & decisiveness of ruling was beyond expectations and leaves SEC w \"very little wiggle room\" via @NYCStein pic.twitter.com/IyEGmWjuHa \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 30, 2023\n\nAs expected, the SEC has delayed its decision on all seven applicants. Analysts had predicted that the SEC may not decide on an ETF until early 2024 when the final deadlines approach (listed below).\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF decision deadlines. Source: Bloomberg/Twitter\n\nJohn Glover, chief investment officer at crypto lending platform Ledn, told Cointelegraph that the ARK 21Shares \u201cverdict slated for Jan. 10 will be the first real indicator as to whether the SEC is ready to start approving these types of applications. The final deadline is up at that point, and a decision will need to be made one way or another.\u201d\n\nWhy has the SEC rejected spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past?\n\nIn its earlier rejection of VanEck\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, the SEC claimed that the Bitcoin market is not big or mature enough to sustain ETF market demand. The commission also said the price volatility and inadequate level of trading surveillance could potentially leave the market prone to fraud and manipulation.\n\nHowever, with the entrance of BlackRock, market pundits have started to believe that the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved are good.\n\nRecent: AI could revolutionize human resources, but there are risks\n\nOne of the major factors preventing a spot ETF from getting approved is the nature of the fund.\n\nA futures ETF is based on futures contracts rather than the digital asset itself, which is an important distinction. The futures markets are already heavily regulated to prevent market manipulation, thus making it easier for the SEC to approve such ETFs.\n\nAt the heart of these spot ETF rejections is the issuer\u2019s requirement to incorporate a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d with a sufficiently large and regulated Bitcoin-related market. Such agreements are integral in ensuring that the SEC can conduct exhaustive investigations in the event of any market irregularities.\n\nA Bitfinex Alpha analyst told Cointelegraph that one of the vital concerns behind the rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs is the regulator\u2019s ability to track and continuously ensure asset safety and custody. However, for that to happen, the U.S. needs more regulatory and legal infrastructure before the \u201cSEC or other involved parties would be comfortable in allowing an ETF provider to handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf not, then the entire purpose of an ETF (which is to circumvent dealing with digital asset wallets or crypto exchanges) is defeated. Thus, it would not be fair to say that spot Bitcoin ETFs do not propose manipulation concerns in the SEC\u2019s eyes. The ProShares Bitcoin ETF disapproval dated back to 2018 clarifies this very point. Another concern with regard to the document\u2019s literature was the ability of the Bitcoin market to handle the volume that would be brought in via the introduction of a spot ETF,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nThe SEC is mainly concerned about the robustness of the trading venues. The regulator oversees futures exchanges like the CME and the Cboe, and any futures ETFs will be restricted to only trading on those regulated venues. Whereas there are no SEC-regulated spot exchanges.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with the SEC\u2019s assumptions about the vulnerabilities of the spot crypto ETF market. James Koutoulas, the founder of a futures-focused hedge fund Typhon, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cI can attest that the crypto futures are far inferior to the spot in terms of tracking error. The concept that a U.S. regulator can provide adequate \u2018surveillance\u2019 against market manipulation on a global 12-figure market is delusional. So, honestly, it probably comes down to passing the buck to the CFTC rather than retaining accountability. Given the SEC has an \u2018investor protection\u2019 mandate.\u201d\n\nHe added that by continuing to reject the simplest products like a BTC ETF, the \u201dSEC keeps pushing demand for crypto offshore and unregulated players. While a BTC ETF may not be perfect, it is much safer than buying BTC with Gensler\u2019s family friend SBF [Sam Bankman-Fried] at FTX.\u201d\n\nRichard Gardener, CEO of tech infrastructure firm Modulus, believes futures ETFs have long been seen as more palatable for regulators and that the decision over a spot ETF is a matter of when not if.\n\nHe told Cointelegraph that a spot BTC ETF is \u201ccoming, sooner rather than later, and the heavy investment from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity signal this. As long as the major players are in the hunt, the industry is seen as viable in the long term, despite any short-term setbacks. If the SEC continues to refuse to act, politicians will be forced to act and develop their own answer to the crypto dilemma.\u201d\n\nEther futures ETF have more chances of approval\n\nWhile crypto enthusiasts would prefer to see spot ETFs, which would legitimize crypto as an asset class, U.S. regulators seem more likely to support futures ETFs.\n\nBloomberg analysts have predicted that the chances of approval for an Ether (ETH) futures-derived ETF are over 90%, with nearly a dozen institutions lined up for approval.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in\n\nReports in financial media suggested a high possibility of the SEC approving an Ether futures-based ETF as soon as October.\n\nThis not surprising to us, we had said they would approve Ether Futures early on in race. Nice to be validated. Now what does it mean for spot? Hard to say beyond it shows that their views/policy/tolerance can change. https://t.co/JXCxNUpj2U \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 17, 2023\n\nKen Timsit, managing director at blockchain startup accelerator Cronos Labs, told Cointelegraph that the \u201cthesis in favor of futures is that futures would enable investors to send signals about the price evolutions expected by the market, which in turn would help to dampen the volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum price and counterbalance the large price swings that we have seen recently.\u201d\n\nDoug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Asset Research, told Cointelegraph that the \u201cnear-term psychological impact would most likely give a boost to crypto markets as another proof point that regulators remain open to evolving the listed space and continued hope for the elusive spot ETF.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) could have dropped much more last week after one on-chain metric repeated its move from the FTX crash.\n\nAs noted on Sept. 5 by James Straten, research and data analyst at crypto insights firm CryptoSlate, the Short to Long-Term Realized Value (SLRV) Ratio has \u201cflipped\u201d for the first time since November 2022.\n\nBitcoin SLRV Ratio channels FTX warning\n\nBTC price weakness is getting market observers ready for a drop toward $23,000, but the fallout from Bitcoin\u2019s August comedown could have been much worse.\n\nAccording to the SLRV Ratio, a spike in sales of \u201colder\u201d Bitcoin occurred in mid-August.\n\nDevised by famed analyst David Puell and ARK Invest, SLRV uses the popular HODL Waves metric to track Bitcoin on-chain velocity.\n\nHODL Waves split up the circulating BTC supply by the age of coins used in transactions. SLRV takes coins that previously moved within the past 24 hours and divides them by those that previously moved between six and 12 months ago.\n\nThe metric also includes two moving averages \u2014 the 30-day and 150-day trendlines \u2014 and crossovers between these have coincided with key BTC price events.\n\nJust before the FTX meltdown, the 150-day line crossed the 30-day line; and in mid-August, the phenomenon repeated for the first time since then.\n\n\u201cSLRV ribbons inverted on August 13, three days before Bitcoin drops to $25k. Last time the metric inverted was just before the FTX collapse,\u201d Staten wrote in part of a commentary on a chart of SLRV from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nBitcoin SLRV Ratio chart. Source: James Straten/X\n\nSpeculators wind down BTC exposure\n\nPrevious analysis has meanwhile paid close attention to behavior of Bitcoin investor cohorts.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin speculators now own the least BTC since $69K all-time highs\n\nThose hodling BTC for 155 days or less, known as short-term holders (STHs) or speculators (compared with longer-term hodlers), are of particular interest to Glassnode, on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant and others.\n\nThe short-term holder cost basis \u2014 the aggregate price at which STHs accumulated their share of the BTC supply \u2014 previously acted as market support, but this appears to no longer be the case.\n\nThe STH cost basis currently sits above the spot price, with Straten reporting that speculators have sold en masse at a loss since late August.\n\nData from CryptoQuant shows the price at which various coins used in transactions last moved.\n\nBitcoin transaction realized price by age band chart (screenshot).

        "content": "On Aug. 29, crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments scored a major victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in its efforts to convert its over-the-counter Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a listed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The U.S. Court of Appeals Circuit Judge Neomi Rao ordered Grayscale\u2019s petition for review be granted and the SEC\u2019s order to deny the GBTC listing application be vacated. Previously, Rao said that the SEC did not \u201coffer any explanation\u201d as to why Grayscale was in the wrong.\n\nInitial enthusiasm in the crypto community about the victory was tempered by the understanding of the limits of the court\u2019s decision. \u201cSo far, every time they lose in court they just shamelessly say the judge got it wrong and pursue more shenanigans,\u201d Delphi Labs general counsel Gabriel Shapiro said. According to Zero Knowledge Consulting managing partner Austin Campbell: \u201cFor many companies, fighting back is incredibly expensive (you will win, but you\u2019ll be bankrupt when you do) or you\u2019re a financial conglomerate where the SEC can fuck up the rest of your business in the meantime. Gangster behavior.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC has postponed its decisions on six applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs. It has designated a longer period in which it may review applications from WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Bitwise and Valkyrie, as well as the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust proposed by Fidelity. The SEC will have another 45 days upon publication in the Federal Register to consider the proposed rule changes allowing the listing of the investment vehicles, giving the regulator until October to approve, deny or delay a decision.\n\nTravel Rule comes into effect in the United Kingdom\n\nCrypto asset businesses in the United Kingdom could now begin withholding certain crypto transfers to comply with the new Travel Rule for crypto that came into effect last week. From now on, if an inbound payment is received from a person or entity from an overseas jurisdiction that hasn\u2019t implemented the Travel Rule, the virtual asset service provider must make a \u201crisk-based assessment\u201d as to \u201cwhether to make the crypto assets available to the beneficiary.\u201d The same rule applies to Brits looking to send payments outside the United Kingdom.\n\nContinue reading\n\nFirst unregistered securities sales claim against NFT offering in the United States\n\nThe SEC has accused Impact Theory \u2014 a media and entertainment company headquartered in Los Angeles \u2014 of engaging in unregistered securities transactions by selling nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to investors from October to December 2021. Allegedly, it raised almost $30 million through the sales of NFTs it called Founder\u2019s Keys, which were offered in three tiers. The company \u201cencouraged potential investors to view the purchase of a Founder\u2019s Key as an investment into the business,\u201d according to the SEC.\n\nContinue reading\n\nCrypto declared a property by a Chinese court\n\nA People\u2019s Court in China published a report on the legality of virtual assets, analyzing the criminal law attributes of these digital assets. The court noted in its report that virtual assets under the current legal policy framework are still legal property and protected by law.\n\nThe \u201cIdentification of the Property Attributes of Virtual Currency and Disposal of Property Involved in the Case\u201d report acknowledged that virtual assets have economic attributes and thus can be classified as property.

        "content": "While lacking in performance, micro Bitcoin mining devices should be seen as a stand against the Bitcoin ecosystem\u2019s purportedly biggest flaw, its inventors argue.\n\nMicro Bitcoin mining devices \u2014 often open-source and pocket-sized \u2014 have been serving a niche part of the market, offering buyers a fully assembled device or a do-it-yourself-kit to mine Bitcoin (BTC) solo.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, developers behind these kits admit that buyers won\u2019t likely see much profit but argue that it\u2019s important to fight the \u201csecrecy and exclusivity\u201d of the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nOne company, BitMaker, recently claimed that one could be made for as little as $3, offering an output of 50 kilohashes per second.\n\nBitMaker\u2019s $3 50Kh/s portable miners. Source: BitMaker\n\nA spokesperson from BitMaker \u2014 a company working on micro miners since as early as June 2022 \u2014 argued that all the well-known Bitcoin ASIC mining rigs are closed-source, very much unlike Bitcoin\u2019s source code.\n\nThis has limited the manufacturing and supply of Bitcoin miners to commercialized entities, they said.\n\n\u201cThe bitcoin mining machine is arguably the most important piece of hardware in the bitcoin ecosystem \u2014 and they are all made in complete secrecy.\u201d\n\nData shows 35.4% of the Bitcoin hash rate comes from the United States, followed by Kazakhstan (18.1%), Russia (11.2%) and Canada (9.6%). U.S.-based Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain and Singapore's Bitdeer Technologies Group are among the largest mining firms in the world.\n\nSkot, a builder of Bitaxe miners, shared a similar sentiment, explaining to Cointelegraph that open-sourcing the design enables much-needed transparency in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe mining industry has traditionally been treated in secrecy and exclusivity. The advent of these open-source projects serves to shed light on this often opaque area, making it more transparent and accessible to the public,\u201d Skot explained.\n\nThere is a growing trend of opensource ASIC-mining going on. ( See #NerdMiner , @DCentralTech , @skot9000 ,...) making it affordable once again and more decentralized. #Bitcoin is rife with innovation on all fronts.\n\nYou only need to know where to look. \u2014 Dimitri-H (@Dimi_h) September 1, 2023\n\nA Bitaxe spokesperson said the engineers behind these projects are open-sourcing documents detailing how to make a hashboard and other mining equipment without needing to rely on large-scale manufacturers:\n\n\u201cThis allows anyone who is interested to build their own miner, or multiple miners, thereby contributing, to some extent, to the decentralization of the system.\u201d\n\nSkot, however, acknowledged that buyers shouldn\u2019t expect to earn much Bitcoin right away. He said while Bitaxe engineers are working to make the miners more efficient, he also argued that the purpose of the portable miners isn\u2019t about profit:\n\n\u201cIt's not necessarily about profit, it's about learning, understanding and in some cases being part of a community.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Bitcoin mining is a model for modern industrial loads\n\nSkot also stressed that the portable miners weren\u2019t built to compete with the commercialized players in the space but rather offer an opportunity for people to run a rig at home without needing to pay for a clunky, overheated and expensive mining rig.\n\nESP-Miner & ESP32 SoC based #BitAxe & #Nerdminer are pivotal developments in Bitcoin mining.\n\n\n\nThese free & open source projects developed by Bitcoin plebs like @skot9000 @BitMaker_ @Public_Pool_BTC & others, are laying the foundation for next-gen #Bitcoin mining hardware\n\n\u26cf\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/FDBTi0PsG1 \u2014 Altair Technology\u00ae \u26cf\ufe0f (@altair_tech) August 30, 2023\n\nOther small form-factor Bitcoin miners in the market include Bitmain AntRouter and Mars Lander. Meanwhile, innovators are also experimenting with how Bitcoin can be mined via mobile phones.\n\nMagazine: Hall of Flame: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M"

        "content": "Bitcoin price tested the $25,350 zone and is currently recovering. BTC must clear the $26,200 resistance to start a decent increase in the near term.\n\nBitcoin is attempting a recovery wave from the $25,350 zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $26,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.\n\nThere was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $26,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\n\nThe pair could start a decent increase if it clears $26,200 and the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nBitcoin Price Faces Hurdles\n\nBitcoin price remained in a bearish zone below the $27,000 resistance zone. BTC extended its decline and traded below the $26,000 level. There was also a spike below $25,500 and the price tested $25,350.\n\nA low was formed near $25,333 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a minor increase above the $25,800 resistance. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $28,150 swing high to the $25,333 low.\n\nBesides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $26,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

        "title": "Bitcoin would trade at this price if it hits its all-time high market cap - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high price of $69,045 on November 10, 2021, as well as an all-time high market cap of $1.302 trillion on the same day. Bitcoin is usually promoted as \u2018digital gold\u2019, due to having a programmed distribution and limited max supply of 21 million BTC \u2014 which can, theoretically, make it a great Store of Value (SoV) long term.\n\nHowever, even with such highlighted good economic fundamentals, BTC is still affected by its supply inflation, while the 21 million units have not been fully distributed to Bitcoin Miners.\n\nConsidering data retrieved by Finbold on September 5, with a current circulating supply of around 19.48 million BTC, one Bitcoin would be worth close to $66,838 \u2014 $2,207 (3.19%) less than its price all-time high in US dollars.\n\nBitcoin Market Cap All-Time High on November 10, 2021. Source: TradingView\n\nMoreover, market capitalization is usually used to measure the market\u2019s perception of value in a given asset, as well as its speculative demand in a given moment. Meaning that Bitcoin constantly needs an increased demand to meet historical prices with a previously lower supply, in a practical application of the supply and demand economic law.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, BTC is trading at $25,747 at the time of publication, which would potentially offer the possibility for Bitcoin investors to gain 160% for purchases made at this moment if the leading cryptocurrency ever meets previous demand.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) 1-year price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nComparatively, the current price is -62.72% lower than the all-time high price.\n\nBitcoin supply inflation\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto decided to create \u201cBitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d, he had to decide how the coins would be distributed in this system. \u201cWho would receive it?\u201d, \u201cHow much would be received?\u201d and \u201cHow often would it be received?\u201d were questions that needed to be answered.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s creator solved the puzzle through mining which, at the same time, would be used to keep the network safe through the Proof-of-Work (PoW); mining would also reward these \u201cworkers\u201d with the programmed distribution of the coin, according to the \u201cwork\u201d that could be \u201cproved\u201d.\n\nIn this way, it was established that: with each block discovered and added to the blockchain, the miner would release an amount in BTC, not yet in circulation, through a special transaction called \u2018coinbase\u2019.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto programmed the Bitcoin protocol so that the amount of coins released into each block through the coinbase was halved whenever 210,000 blocks had been mined, until it reached zero, completing the distribution at close to 21 million BTC \u2014 something expected to happen in the year of 2140, if nothing is changed until then.\n\nInterestingly, in the current \u2018halving cycle\u2019 of 6.25 BTC being created in every block, released on average every 10 minutes (according to the mining difficulty adjustment), Bitcoin has a supply inflation of 900 BTC per day or 328,500 BTC per year. Resulting in a yearly inflation of around 1.7%, that will be halved in 2024.\n\nHow other cryptocurrencies would perform according to their all-time high market cap?\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Share:\n\nAnalyst Crypto Rover attributes the current lull market to BlackRock, accusing the asset manager of deliberately driving down Bitcoin price.\n\nIn his opinion, the firm is trying to achieve a better buying position so that the ETF earns them more upon approval.\n\nWhile this is mere speculation, it is a reminder for retail investors to be more analytical in a market swayed by big players.\n\nBlackRock asset manager is among the list of institutional players awaiting a decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after filing applications for Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals.\n\nAlso Read: The BlackRock and crypto connection is much deeper than what people know of\n\nBlackRock driving Bitcoin price down deliberately, Crypto Rover\n\nWhile the market awaits a decision from the US SEC, crypto enthusiast and renowned analyst Daan de Rover (Crypto Rover) says BlackRock asset manager is deliberately driving Bitcoin price down. His thoughts are based on the argument that the company would \u201crequire actual Bitcoin to back their Spot ETF\u201d if approval comes.\n\nMany individuals don't realize that BlackRock would require actual Bitcoin to back their Spot ETF.\n\n\n\nThey might have already purchased their Bitcoin months ago when prices were lower.\n\n\n\nOr, they could be deliberately driving down prices currently to establish a better buying\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dKW2awmcuL \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) September 5, 2023\n\nIn this regard, Rover presents two perspectives:\n\nThey might have already purchased their Bitcoin months ago when prices were lower. Or, they could be driving down prices deliberately to establish a better buying position for themselves.\n\nHe wagers on the latter, noting that they would be fighting to keep prices up if they had bought earlier. Therefore, a surge in prices, possibly steered by a Spot BTC approval, would earn them more value against their purchase price.\n\nCrypto Rover has built a career helping investors understand cryptocurrency trading through free educational content on different topics. These range from basic investing basics to advanced technical analysis.\n\nInstitutional investors buying Bitcoin\n\nAccording to renowned Bitcoin writer Mark Helfman, institutional investors rarely buy BTC directly lest they expose themselves to legal and regulatory risks. Instead, they leverage custody solutions to conceal their activities. Helfman cites \u201clarge buyers and sellers\u201d who \u201cfind a broker for a private sale and settle the exchange in batches.\u201d\n\nThe transactions happen outside the exchange at an agreed price different from the spot price indicated on the exchange. In Helfman\u2019s words:\n\nSince bitcoin is pseudonymous and you can create new wallets ad nauseum, plus brokers are not obligated to report private deals, it\u2019s difficult to know who\u2019s moving money where without forensic technology or an insider who knows about the deal.\n\nAs a result of this, buying and selling often happens without affecting the price of Bitcoin, meaning it may go unnoticed on a chart because they tactfully buy just enough at any given time not to disturb the price. That said, large holders can still also dump Bitcoin to drive down the price.\n\nMore broadly, institutional investors are more experienced, knowledgeable, and have more connections. Given their mostly huge Assets Under Management (AUM), it only takes a small fraction of their holdings to influence Bitcoin price.\n\nInstitutional investors are usually highly secretive about their dealings. By the time retail traders know an institution has made a move it is usually too late, says Helfman. They would only announce \u201cWe are interested in buying,\u201d for example, after they had already bought.\n\nIf there is any truth to Rover\u2019s assertions, then it highlights the role and influence of big corporations in driving the market. It also reminds retail investors to be more analytical in a market swayed by big players."

        "content": "Mon 04 Sep 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nAmid alarming inflation, a new trend is emerging in Turkey: more than half the population is now embracing cryptocurrencies as a financial haven. Here\u2019s an overview of this transformation.\n\nKey points:\n\nMassive crypto adoption in Turkey following rapid inflation;\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum dominate investment choices;\n\nYoung Turkish women show growing interest in crypto.\n\nIncreased crypto adoption in Turkey amid inflation\n\nFacing unbridled inflation, Turkey is witnessing a growing infatuation with cryptocurrencies. According to a recent study by KuCoin, Turkish adoption of cryptos has soared from 40% to a notable 52% in just eighteen months.\n\nKuCoin, one of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange platforms, highlighted this development. Their study indicates that more and more Turks see crypto assets as a shield against the rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira. Faced with a lira that has fallen by more than 50% against the dollar, citizens are looking for solid financial alternatives.\n\n\u201cOur observations on Turkey, combined with other previous country studies, show that the increase in the number and percentage of crypto investors reflects a growing confidence and infatuation with cryptocurrency. This is all the more marked with the Turkish lira having lost more than 50% of its value against the US dollar,\u201d a KuCoin representative told Decrypt.\n\nHowever, Turkey is not an isolated case. Similar trends have been noticed in Brazil and Nigeria. Cryptocurrencies seem to offer a safe haven for many people in the face of depreciating local currencies. The figures bear this out: 58% of those surveyed see cryptocurrency as a long-term investment, while 37% see it as a reliable means of preserving their capital.\n\nFrom Bitcoins to women investors: Turkey redefines the Crypto landscape\n\nTurkish investors\u2019 enthusiasm for Bitcoin is undeniable: 71% of them hold BTC. Ethereum comes next, chosen by 45% of investors. While historically the world of crypto investing has been predominantly male, in Turkey the situation is changing. Today, almost half (47%) of investors in the 18-30 age bracket are women.\n\nBeyond its growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, Turkey is nurturing broader ambitions. It is also considering setting up its own central bank digital currency, the Digital Lira.\n\nIn conclusion, in the face of its economic challenges, Turkey sees crypto as a notable opportunity. More than a mere observer of the rise of cryptos, it aspires to position itself as a key player in the digital revolution with its own central bank digital currency, the Digital Lira.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

In July this year, $AKT was equivalent to $0.56.\n\nAkash Supercloud for AI\n\nThe decentralized open source network works by pairing up prospective customers with data center providers willing to lease out their hardware, with Akash playing matchmaker.\n\nNow, the firm has launched its Supercloud for AI platform, which hosts Nvidia H100 and Nvdia A100 GPUs that power the most powerful generative AI systems today. This is alongside the best AMD GPUs, and the best consumer-grade GPUs.\n\nThe Supercloud for AI upgrade \u2013 known as Mainnet 6 as it\u2019s the sixth upgrade to the Mainnet network \u2013 will open up an open source marketplace for high-density GPUs.\n\nExising network providers, which range from small providers to hyperscalers themselves (should they wish to take part) can now successfully offer their GPUs in addition to the compute resources they already offer.\n\n\u201cAs the network grows, it will only become more powerful, hosting greater and greater quantities of GPUs from providers around the world while becoming an integrated part of the infrastructure powering AI development,\u201d the company said in a press release.\n\n\u201cIt is more important than ever that these challenges are addressed with a fully open-source network \u2014 which prevents control of these resources from concentrating in the hands of a few large corporations.\n\nThe main problem with the cloud market, according to Akash, is that it\u2019s dominated by a monopoly of four providers \u2013 Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Alibaba. The best cloud provdiders are, the firm claims, charging overinflated prices, and many of their data centers end up being underutilized to some extent.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most powerful GPUs, meanwhile, have been hoovered by hyperscalers and major corporations, which has served to only further consolidate these business' hold over the public cloud market.\n\nWith Akash having launched its Supercloud for AI GPU network, it could reshape the way AI models are trained in the future."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF: coming after Grayscale victory - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Last week, Grayscale won its lawsuit against the SEC over the agency\u2019s refusal to approve spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis victory could have a significant impact on the crypto market, and not just in the long term.\n\nApproval of Bitcoin ETFs following Grayscale\u2019s victory\n\nThe first consequence could be that the SEC will finally be forced to approve spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIt should be recalled that in the US, the SEC has so far only approved ETFs based on bitcoin price futures contracts, and not yet ETFs backed directly by BTC (so-called spot bitcoin ETFs).\n\nIn addition, spot bitcoin ETFs have been approved in other parts of the world, including neighbouring Canada.\n\nThe ruling by the Southern District Court of New York, which gave Grayscale the right to do so, effectively ordered the SEC to proceed with approval if all requirements and laws are met.\n\nMany believe that the SEC now has its back to the wall, with JPMorgan, for example, arguing that the agency will probably have no choice but to approve many of the applications.\n\nIndeed, the court\u2019s ruling explicitly rules out that the reasons given by the SEC so far should be considered sufficient for a rejection, and states that the SEC\u2019s stance is arbitrary and therefore implicitly unfair.\n\nIn truth, however, there is nothing to suggest that the SEC will not do as it has always done and take its time, delaying the decision as long as possible, as it did on Friday.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan\u2019s analysts say that the delay is likely to indicate that the SEC will approve several applications at the same time, in order to avoid first-mover advantages.\n\nOnce the agency is forced to make a decision, it is expected to opt for bulk approval.\n\nThe inflow of capital: the arrival of bitcoin ETFs after Grayscale\u2019s victory\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have one feature that makes them extremely attractive to the market.\n\nAs they are backed directly by BTC, they require the physical delivery of an amount of BTC equal to the value of the shares issued.\n\nThese BTCs have to be bought on the market, so the more shares they sell, the more Bitcoin they have to buy on the market to immobilise.\n\nThis should reduce the supply on the market and probably increase the price.\n\nAccording to Anthony Pompliano, the capital inflow into the spot bitcoin ETFs can be estimated at two billion dollars, which would mean a withdrawal of up to 77,000 bitcoins from the market.\n\nPomp on CNBC: A #Bitcoin ETF will be approved in the US. It will lead to billions of dollars of inflows.\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/crUnQEsNNE \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 2, 2023\n\nWhile it is not possible to calculate exactly what impact such inflows could have on the price of BTC, it is possible that at a time like this the impact could be significant.\n\nThe shortage of supply\n\nWe are in a very strange moment.\n\nThe amount of BTC on exchanges is at its lowest level in years, partly because after the various failures of 2022, many holders realised that it would be better not to leave bitcoin on exchanges.\n\nFurthermore, exchange volumes are also very low, and these two things together mean that even a not particularly large inflow of capital can be enough to upset the precarious balance between supply and demand very quickly.\n\nThis means that a significant inflow of capital could significantly increase demand, which is currently very low, and thus put pressure on prices.\n\nHowever, there is no certainty about the timing, not least because the two billion that Pompliano refers to would not come in all at once once the ETFs are approved.\n\nThe halving of bitcoin\n\nAdd to this the fact that in April next year, less than eight months away, there will be the fourth halving of Bitcoin, which in turn is expected to reduce the supply of BTC on the market, as it will halve the miners\u2019 revenues in one fell swoop.\n\nIf the ETFs are expected to be approved by February or March 2024 at the latest, they will actually be approved just before the halving. So the $2 billion of inflows they could attract could come at the same time as the halving, or in the months immediately after.\n\nHistorically, a bull run has started a few months after the halving.\n\nThe first halving occurred in September 2012, and the bull run started in early 2013.\n\nThe second halving occurred in July 2016, and the bull run began in early 2017.\n\nThe third halving occurred in May 2020 and the bull run began in November of that year.\n\nAlthough historical data is by no means sufficient to predict the future, it is possible that a similar scenario could trigger a new bull run in 2024 if the past repeats itself.\n\nHowever, it is not known whether the market value of bitcoin will have remained stable or fallen in the meantime."
