        "title": "Tether to Further Strengthen Reserves Through Purchase of Bitcoin with Realized Net Operating Profits - Tether USD",
        "content": "17 May 2023 - Tether International Limited (Tether), the company managing the reserves of the first and most widely used stablecoin, announced today its latest investment strategy aimed at further strengthening its reserves portfolio.\n\nStarting this month, Tether will regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits towards purchasing Bitcoin (BTC). Tether anticipates that the current and future BTC holdings in its reserves will not exceed the Shareholder Capital Cushion and will further strengthen and diversify the reserves. As reflected in Tether\u2019s Q1 2023 Assurance Report, as of the end of March 2023, Tether already held approximately $1.5 billion in BTC in its reserves. While it is common practice among many institutional investors to third-party custody their Bitcoin, Tether believes in the philosophy \"Not your keys, not your bitcoin\" and takes possession of the private keys associated with all of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nUnder this new approach, Tether will focus exclusively on utilizing realized profits from its investment strategy, disregarding unrealized capital gains generated by price increases. This means that Tether will consider only the tangible gains from its operations, which consist of the difference, between purchase price and net proceeds from the sale or, in case of a maturing investment, between the purchase price and the reimbursed amount (for example the notional amount for a zero coupon investment like with U.S. treasury bills).\n\nTether\u2019s purchase of BTC is part of its conservative and prudent approach to investment decisions aimed at strengthening, increasing and diversifying its reserves. By implementing this framework, Tether aims to enhance transparency and provide a clearer view of the company's performance and capital allocation strategy.\n\n\"The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset,\u201d said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether. \u201cBitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned Bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike. Our investment in Bitcoin is not only a way to enhance the performance of our portfolio, but it is also a method of aligning ourselves with a transformative technology that has the potential to reshape the way we conduct business and live our lives.\u201d\n\nTether believes that Bitcoin has demonstrated its investment potential with a track record of impressive returns over the past decade. Its performance, combined with increasing recognition and adoption by major financial institutions, has cemented Bitcoin's position as a key component in diversified investment portfolios.\n\nBy incorporating Bitcoin into its investment strategy, Tether aims to capitalize on the digital asset's potential growth, while leveraging its position as a trusted and reliable financial infrastructure provider. Tether's decision to allocate a portion of its net realized operating profits towards Bitcoin highlights the company's confidence in the cryptocurrency market and its belief in supporting the broader ecosystem.\n\nAmong other smaller investments performed with its own capital, Tether Group is focusing on building communication (through peer-to-peer technologies like Holepunch), energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure\n\nTether will continue to adhere to stringent risk management practices to ensure the stability and security of its operations. The company remains steadfast in its commitment to maintaining the stability of its flagship stablecoin, Tether (USD\u20ae), while exploring innovative opportunities in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape."

        "content": "A picture taken in London shows gold-plated souvenir cryptocurrency tether, bitcoin and ethereum coins arranged beside a screen displaying a trading chart, May 8, 2022.\n\nCryptocurrency giant Tether on Wednesday said that it's going to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin to back the world's largest stablecoin.\n\nThe company said it would invest 15% of its net profit into bitcoin to \"diversify\" the reserves that back its USDT token, which aims to stick to a 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThat would amount to roughly $222 million, based on the company's last attestation report, which provides a breakdown of the assets that make up its USDT reserves as well as excess reserves and profits.\n\nA Tether spokesperson clarified the bitcoin it purchases would amount to only a small portion of its overall net profit, with the bulk of excess income being spent on running the business, including bank fees.\n\n\"The aim is to keep the Bitcoin portfolio value well below the size of our total excess reserves that accounted for 2.48B at the end of Q1/2023, while bitcoin holdings accounted for 1.5B,\" the Tether spokesperson said.\n\nUSDT is the largest stablecoin in the market, with a circulating supply of more than $82.8 billion, according to CoinGecko data. It competes with Circle's USD Coin and Binance's BUSD.\n\nStablecoins are used by traders to move in and out of different cryptocurrencies without converting money back into fiat currencies.\n\n\"The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset,\" Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement.\n\n\"Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned Bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike.\"\n\nThe move would make Tether an even bigger holder of bitcoin \u2014 the firm already holds over $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet \u2014 and follows moves from notable investors like Paul Tudor Jones and MicroStrategy boss Michael Saylor to accumulate huge stockpiles, in the belief that the token is immune to the effects of currency depreciation and inflation.\n\nAnalysts and investors have previously told CNBC that bitcoin could get a boost this year due to the influence of so-called \"whales\" \u2014 market players with significant financial firepower, which enables them to buy up huge sums of tokens.\n\nTether's methods to maintain a $1 value for its token have drawn controversy in the past because of concerns over the quality of its reserve assets. Previously, the company held a great deal of its reserves in commercial paper \u2014 a form of short-term, unsecured debt issued by companies. This is seen as less safer than other forms of debt, such as U.S. Treasury bills.\n\nTether sought to allay investor fears by rotating out of commercial paper and replacing these fund holdings with only U.S. government debt securities.\n\nIn February, the company said it had whittled down its commercial paper holdings to zero.\n\nUSDT and its issuer remain a source of contention in the crypto market. The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly investigating executives at Tether over possible bank fraud.\n\nStablecoins were already a hot-button issue for regulators, who have been scrambling to figure out how to keep the industry in check after the demise of several notable firms in the space."

        "content": "Tether International Ltd., the company behind the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value, will use 15% of its net investment profit, equivalent to $222 million of its first-quarter profit, on Bitcoin to diversify reserves backing its USDT stablecoin.\n\nKey Takeaways The issuer of the world's largest stablecoin will add to its $1.5 billion BTC reserves.\n\nTether started making a profit from operations in February of this year.\n\nThe Bitcoin allocation will amount to over $200 million based on a recent profit.\n\nTether was fined by U.S. regulators in 2021 for misrepresenting reserves backing its stablecoin meant to keep it at 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. The company, which said last week that its assets total $81.1 billion, said most of that was in the form of Treasury bills, and that 85% of its assets were \"extremely liquid\" in cash and cash equivalents. Gold and Bitcoin accounted for about 4% and 2% of Tether's total reserves, respectively.\n\n\n\nTether said it doesn't expect its Bitcoin holdings to exceed its share capital cushion\u2014reserves in excess of the customer liabilities from Tether's token issuances.\n\nTether Reserve Transparency Debate Continues\n\nThe company was fined $41 million by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and separately by the New York Attorney General two years ago for its handling of reserves. Critics say Tether has far to go before its reserves are regarded as transparent and confirmed.\n\n\"Tether\u2019s fundamental business, the essence of everything Tether does, is tied exclusively to Tether\u2019s financial reserves,\" former SEC attorney James Reed Stark tweeted last week. \"Yet those reserves remain unaudited, unconfirmed and therefore dubious.\"\n\nStark's comments sparked a twitter debate between him Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino.\n\nTether's Bet on BTC Upside\n\nTether's bet on Bitcoin \"aims to capitalize on the digital asset's potential growth\" and it's not the only company to do so. Software company MicroStrategy (MSTR) has also been buying Bitcoin as an investment. At the end of the first quarter, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin stash swelled to 140,000, valued at about $4.2 billion.\n\n\n\nTether's new strategy could also underpin the price of Bitcoin into the end of the year, with analysts at Standard Chartered Bank saying the cryptocurrency may hit $100k by the end of 2024, CNBC reported. The collapse of SVB and mid-tier lenders have improved the outlook for BTC as a \"trustless asset,\" while profits at crypto miners and the end of the Fed's tightening cycle would also help, said analyst Geoff Kendrick."

The decentralized financial capital of the world,\" Suarez said in 2022.\n\nNow ahead of Bitcoin 2023, the collapse of FTX and the suspension of Miami Coin trading are leading some to wonder if this crypto craze was a bunch of bull.\n\nGet South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.\n\n\"I take a controversial approach. I say almost 90% of all projects, whether it was a coin or NFT project, they were pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes,\" said Ryan Kirkley, founder of Cryptan Labs and blockchain expert. \"They only worked as long as people kept thinking they were going to be worth more later on. The problem is at the end of the day someone gets left in the back.\"\n\nKirkley moved to Miami in 2021 and said in the early stages, his company invested heavily in cryptocurrency but then began to pivot toward venture capital and artificial intelligence.\n\n\"I know a lot of prominent leaders in Miami who are not in Miami for the Bitcoin conference, which a year ago, you would've never thought of that,\" Kirkley said. \"So I do think we are seeing a pretty big shift as far as what's important to the tech leaders, entrepreneurs, CEOs and investors in the space. There is still a contingent that are Bitcoin to the end, but the majority of us are far more excited about building on technology and how to transform into the next era of technology.\"\n\nTech entrepreneur Temante Leary plans to attend the conference this weekend and said he still has confidence in Bitcoin. He believes Miami continues to be the crypto capital of the nation.\n\n\"I still have confidence in Bitcoin. I think it will go up,\" Leary said. \"I am still seeing a lot of new entrance into the Miami market and a lot of those entrants are in the fintech, crypto space.\"\n\nNBC6 reached out to Mayor Suarez's office for comment, but he was not available for an interview.

I\u2019m always going to stick with it,\u201d he added.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) came up as a hedge against inflation in Jones\u2019 conversation with Aaron Ross Sorkin. The two were previously discussing how quantitative easing and flat interest rates lasted all the way through 2021. Jones said this policy contributed somewhat to the banking failures in 2023.\n\n\u201cAnyone that was listening to our Fed at that point in time was probably doing exactly what these banks did \u2014 extending maturities \u2014 because they were being told that inflation didn\u2019t exist, and when it finally did come, it was transitory and rates were going to be low forever.\u201d\n\nOf course, inflation wasn\u2019t transitory with the CPI reaching a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Bitcoin\u2019s price sank as low as $18,999.95 on July 13, 2022, the day the June CPI report was released.\n\nNotably, Jones said the strategy of buying bitcoin and gold as an inflation hedge \u201cmay be over\u201d if prices begin to moderate.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoin isn\u2019t without its risks, according to Jones. He cited the US regulatory regime as a major thorn in the side of the world\u2019s first digital currency.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has a real problem because in the United States you have the entire regulatory apparatus against it,\u201d Jones said.\n\nCNBC\u2019s interview with Jones made news because he said there\u2019s a \u201cgood chance\u201d that the US could be on the verge of a recession by the third quarter based on \u201crecent financial episodes.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "But I'll leave you with one last bit of history to mull: SegWit was written long before it was ever implemented, and found its way into Bitcoin's source code well before there was complete consensus between users and miners, with arguably just a slight quorum Bitcoin Core developers in favor. There's good that came from the resulting debate \u2013 including, as former Blockstream CTO Samson Mow noted, a concerted drive to reduce the concentrated power of miners (Blockstream was early on the trend of building mining facilities in North America). But SegWit was a change that made it into a Core release, which could have passed unnoticed had miners not boycotted the change. Is there not some version of the story where the rarefied circles of Bitcoin puritans are in the wrong? Where miners, wanting a vote, kickstarted a debate that changed how Bitcoin is governed for the better?"

        "content": "The launch of BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals NFTs on Bitcoin has transformed the No. 1 blockchain overnight into a clunkier version of Ethereum.\n\nThe core developers and miners who signed off on the network\u2019s Taproot upgrade in November 2021 never envisaged this would be the result. Bitcoin now suffers from many of the same problems that have bedeviled Ethereum for years, including scammy memecoins and shitcoins, NFTs of monkey pictures hogging block space and skyrocketing transaction fees.\n\n\n\nThe network is even having to deal with incidences of miner extractable value (MEV), whereby miners profit by reordering pending transactions.\n\nMati Greenspan\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of upset at myself for not realizing,\u201d says Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan, a Bitcoiner since 2013.\n\n\u201cIt took these guys starting to hype up JPEGs on Bitcoin until I was like: \u2018Oh shit, what did we just do?\u2019\u201d He laughs ruefully.\n\nSome Bitcoiners on Bitcointalk and Twitter refer to the impact of Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens as an attack on Bitcoin, an exploit of Taproot, or simply as spam clogging up the network.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s sparked a fierce debate over whether unexpected outcomes are precisely the sort of outcomes you should expect from a permissionless protocol, or whether something needs to be done to get rid of them.\n\n\n\nWhy are Bitcoin fees so high?\n\nBRC-20 tokens were only launched by anonymous developer Domo back on March 8. They use Ordinal inscriptions of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data to deploy token contracts, mint tokens and transfer tokens. Some argue this is horribly inefficient and costs four times as much in transaction fees as if they just used binary.\n\n\n\nAlongside the inefficiencies, there\u2019s also a gold rush for minting memecoins. Someone will deploy a contract with a ticker for a new token and a max supply, and then traders rush in to mint as many as possible in the series, on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis, at whatever fee rate gets them priority. These tokens have already surpassed $1 billion in market cap \u2014 even though Domo argues they will be worthless.\n\n\n\nBut they are here to stay \u2014 at least in the short term \u2014 with major wallets already adding support for BRC-20 tokens. And newer developments, such as the launch of a Uniswap fork that amassed $500,000 in trading of \u201csmart BRC-20\u201d tokens (SBRC-20) in just a few days, suggest that the building of a permissionless new ecosystem on Bitcoin is set to continue.\n\nFees too high to bank the unbanked\n\nGreenspan points out that while the flurry of interest has seen Bitcoin transactions hit an all-time high, the number of unique addresses plummeted, meaning fewer people are accessing the network. And while transaction fee revenue has overtaken the block reward \u2014 seen by many as the only way to ensure Bitcoin\u2019s security after another couple of halvings \u2014 it comes with a lot of issues.\n\n\u201cI spoke to one miner yesterday who said his revenue has doubled, which is nice, especially ahead of the halving, so it\u2019s good for miners, but it\u2019s terrible for the countries of Nigeria and El Salvador, for example, where, suddenly, the average cost to send a transaction is $30,\u201d he says. \u201cThe dream of financial inclusion on Bitcoin has been temporarily postponed.\u201d\n\nRead also: What it\u2019s actually like to use Bitcoin in El Salvador\n\nInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time someone has put a token or NFTs onto Bitcoin. Counterparty led the way with NFTs on Bitcoin, with Spells of Genesis and Rare Pepes in 2015 and 2016. And stablecoin Tether also launched a token on Bitcoin back in 2014 via the Mastercoin protocol (which later became Omni).\n\nJoseph Hall tries using Bitcoin to get by in El Salvador for Magazine.\n\nBan the spam, say Bitcoin maxis\n\nOn Bitcointalk, there is much discussion of fighting off the \u201cattack on Bitcoin,\u201d with some claiming it\u2019s the work of malicious Bitcoin SV devs. Users are talking about a soft fork to \u201cenforce strict Taproot validation script size,\u201d ways the protocol can filter out what they see as \u201cspam\u201d or even a hard fork to reverse Taproot.\n\nBitcoin developer Luke Dashjr stated that \u201caction should have been taken months ago. Spam filtration has been a standard part of Bitcoin Core since Day 1. It\u2019s a mistake that the existing filters weren\u2019t extended to Taproot transactions [\u2026] since this is a bugfix, it doesn\u2019t really even need to wait for a major release.\u201d\n\nIf Ethereum devs ever did anything remotely close to the below email, there would be absolute hysterics. People say ETH devs are too centralized with too much power. Look in the mirror. https://t.co/yBVNk2kixW \u2014 Hal Press (@NorthRockLP) May 9, 2023\n\nGlassnode\u2019s lead on-chain analyst, Checkmate, tells Magazine that he believes this sort of censorship is against the entire ethos of Bitcoin and notes there are already optional mempool rules enabling node operators to filter ordinals if they choose.\n\nCheckmate\u2019s Twitter profile pic.\n\n\u201cFrom my view, any attempt to ban or censor these transactions is far more of an attack on Bitcoin than leaving them be. They are within consensus rules, and when a loud minority of individuals want to change the rules to stop something they don\u2019t like, that is the real attack.\u201d\n\nBut podcaster Chris Blec made the case on Twitter that limiting transaction types to ensure the health of the network wasn\u2019t censorship.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t depend on the content of the message or the sender of the message, then it\u2019s not censorship,\u201d he said.\n\nHass McCook, a former member of the Bitcoin Mining Council and a Bitcoin true believer, is no fan of Ordinals but thinks trying to get rid of them is a step too far, saying:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe only thing more important than Bitcoin is freedom. My general take is I personally don\u2019t like it and don\u2019t see value in it. But I don\u2019t want to censor it. I think that could go down a very dark path.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the protocol allows for something and somebody is happy to pay to do that thing, then it is what it is.\u201d\n\nI haven't heard one coherent argument yet as to how limiting spam on Bitcoin (including that which enables ordinals) equates to \"censorship\".\n\n\n\nIf there is one, please provide it here. \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) May 9, 2023\n\nImpossible to ban Ordinals anyway\n\nAndrew Poelstra, director of research for Blockstream, is one of the inventors of Taproot. He doesn\u2019t like the upgrade\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d offspring either but doesn\u2019t see any practical way to stop them.\n\n\u201cAs near as I can tell, there is no sensible way to prevent people from storing arbitrary data in witnesses without incentivizing even worse behavior and/or breaking legitimate use cases,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRead also: Is Bitcoin a religion? If not, it soon could be\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be possible just to ban \u2018useless data,\u2019\u201d he said, noting that people could just hide useless data like NFTs inside of useful data like \u201cdummy signatures or public keys.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDoing so would incur a 2x cost to them, but if 2x is enough to incentivize storage, then there\u2019s no need to have this discussion because they will be forced to stop due to fee market competition anyway.\u201d\n\nBitcoin transaction fees are back down to $5. I'm so glad that Ordinals fad is finally over. pic.twitter.com/8gl4kwcXTC \u2014 Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 14, 2023\n\nIgnore them, and they\u2019ll go away\n\nThe best-case scenario \u2014 and the most likely, according to interviewees for this piece \u2014 is that interest in the tokens and NFTs will die down as the memecoin fad plays out.\n\n\u201cNetwork congestion on Bitcoin is not a new thing, right?\u201d says Greenspan. \u201cIt usually comes with hype. But also it leaves when the hype is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most likely to happen is people are gonna run out of money.\u201d\n\nBut if Ordinals continue to have an outsized impact on the network, there\u2019s always the nuclear option of forking Bitcoin to modify or remove Taproot. Blec and many others have raised the possibility, though it seems mostly hypothetical at this stage.\n\nIf enough Bitcoin ecosystem participants (users, node operators, miners) reach a consensus that Bitcoin should be forked in a way that reduces spammy txs, that's not censorship.\n\n\n\nYou can still mine & use the current fork and mint your dumb jpgs there. \u2014 Chris Blec (@ChrisBlec) May 9, 2023\n\nFork Bitcoin to get rid of Ordinals\n\nGreenspan says, while it\u2019s always possible to implement a hard fork, \u201cit\u2019ll split the network. And nobody wants that.\u201d\n\nMcCook says the market chose Bitcoin, rather than Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV during the scaling wars in 2017, and he predicts the current version would win over a fork with Taproot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take the Ordinals one. So, even though I don\u2019t find any value in Ordinals, maybe I need to inscribe something in the future that I need to have absolute censorship resistance,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially have pretty powerful implications. Let\u2019s say Julian Assange decided to do his WikiLeaks info dump as an inscription, this is a very useful thing.\u201d\n\nGreenspan also believes the benefits of using Bitcoin to store data have only just begun to be explored.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are now aware that Bitcoin has the ability to store files. And I\u2019m excited to see what, you know, forward-thinking developers will do with this new tool. More than just creating memes.\u201d\n\nMake the tokens better\n\nWhen he released BRC-20, Domo added, \u201cI believe there are almost certainly better design choices and optimization improvements to be made.\u201d\n\nPlenty of people agree. One of the easiest improvements would be to use binary rather than the JSON format, which developer John W. Ratcliff argues is \u201cone of the most inefficient data formats anyone could use.\u201d He believes this would reduce BRC-20 tokens from 89 bytes to 19.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis means that they are paying over four times as much in fees to commit these BRC-20 tokens than necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nHashrate Index researcher Colin Harper says that using binary code \u201ccould reduce bandwidth by as much as 80%.\u201d However, this wouldn\u2019t entirely solve the problem, as Bitcoin influencer Udi Wertheimer points out, given the spike in fees is due to token minting degens bidding up fees to get their transaction prioritized into order to mint or snatch up low serial number tokens before the supply runs out.\n\nThere\u2019s also another way to issue assets on Bitcoin called Taro, which Domo says is \u201ca better solution. Taproot Asset Representation Overlay is a proposed protocol that will allow people to issue digital assets on Bitcoin that can be transferred to Lightning for fast and cheap transactions.\n\n\n\nRead also: Attack of the zkEVMs! Crypto\u2019s 10x moment\n\nBuild a virtual machine on top of Bitcoin\n\nA much more radical and experimental approach is being taken by Trustless Computer, which is behind a Uniswap v2 fork called Trustless Market that enabled $500,000 worth of swaps in its first three days.\n\nThe project\u2019s documentation states it\u2019s working toward a Turing-complete virtual machine called BVM built on top of Bitcoin to enable a DeFi ecosystem.\n\n\n\nCore team member @punk3700 tells Magazine it \u201cis not a layer 2, it\u2019s a \u2018protocol within layer 1\u2019\u201d that works like Ordinals but uses SBRC-20s.\n\n\n\nInstead of writing \u201ctext files to Bitcoin, Trustless Computer writes smart contract transactions to Bitcoin. Raw files vs. programs/logic/apps.\u201d He claims this cuts down the bandwidth required for the tokens by 80%\u201390%.\n\nStick-figuring out how a Bitcoin Virtual Machine would work.\n\n\u201cI think the BRC-20 in their current form (using text files) are a flash in the pan,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t use paper and pen to build an alternative scalable financial instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur SBRC-20 implementation is different. We use smart contracts, the same ERC-20 smart contract on Ethereum. It works exactly as programmed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOrdinals is v0.1 of what is possible on Bitcoin. Trustless Computer shows that you can build a full DApp ecosystem on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe expects that we\u2019ll see MakerDAO, Aave, Compound and other smart contracts deployed soon, which, if it works as he claims it will, would be a huge change for Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWhile the project has recieved coverage in other major crypto news outlets, Magazine hasn\u2019t verified their tech works as promised, and the extent to which you can integrate smart contracts with Bitcoin is debatable, so tread carefully.\n\nCan we scale Bitcoin with ZK-rollups?\n\nThe influx of NFTs and token minting on Bitcoin has shown the blockchain remains unable to scale to deal with increased demand, meaning the more popular it gets, the worse it works.\n\n\n\nThe Lightning Network is usually touted as the solution, but Nostr creator Fiatjaf noted it has been unable to cope with the recent fee spike. \u201cChannels are too fragile, it costs a lot to open a channel under a high fee environment, to run a routing node and so on,\u201d he wrote, stating that users instead had to rely on the centralized Lightning providers.\n\nGreenspan believes that gradual progress toward scaling is the only safe solution to ensure Bitcoin remains bulletproof.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Segway; we\u2019ve seen Taproot. I mean, these are, these are good progressions and steady scaling. Which is what\u2019s best usually for a decentralized network of this size. You don\u2019t want to rush things because you might break them. As we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead Also: Reformed \u2018altcoin slayer\u2019 Eric Wall on shitposting and scaling Ethereum\n\n\n\nVarious parties, including StarkWare and blockchain researcher Eric Wall, have been investigating scaling Bitcoin using zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, which is Ethereum\u2019s plan to solve its very similar challenges.\n\n\n\nBut ironically, while the surge in demand caused by Ordinals has shown that further scaling is required, it\u2019s also made it much less likely the community would agree to a new hard fork to enable ZK-rollups. After all, they voted for Taproot and look what happened?\n\n\u201cI doubt that will ever happen,\u201d says Checkmate.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am also skeptical of even a soft fork since the unintended consequences of the witness discount have woken everyone up to the risks of change.\u201d"

To this end, they offer a range of services, including Bitcoin brokerage, full-reserve custody, mining, and a Bitcoin wallet that supports both on-chain and Lightning Network transactions.\n\nRiver\u2019s CEO, Alex Leishman, has noted a surge in Bitcoin interest, particularly from businesses and institutions. He attributes this to growing recognition of the flaws in the traditional financial system and an acknowledgment of Bitcoin\u2019s potential to foster a more secure and transparent global economy.\n\nThe company has also developed River Lightning, an enterprise API that facilitates integration with the Lightning Network. It\u2019s already being used by several crypto applications, such as El Salvador\u2019s Chivo wallet, for instant Bitcoin payments.\n\nWith the demand for Lightning transactions increasing due to rising on-chain fees, River plans to use part of the funding to enhance its B2B River Lightning segment. The company aspires to be the industry\u2019s back-end for Bitcoin payments.\n\nEmphasising River\u2019s commitment to regulatory compliance and avoiding undue risks, Leishman maintains that River\u2019s approach is to do things right. The firm intends to continue promoting a brighter economic future powered by Bitcoin, staying true to its mission.\n\nFounded in 2019, River has emerged as a leading player in Bitcoin technology and financial services. The company provides an all-in-one mobile app and platform for Bitcoin brokerage, custody, and mining.

        "content": "The US could be headed towards a recession, a potentially unprecedented test for the crypto industry.\n\nOutside of the two-month recession around the Covid pandemic, crypto has never experienced any legitimate economic downturn. The mortgage-fueled \u201cGreat Recession\u201d from 2007 to 2009 preceded Satoshi Nakomoto launching the Bitcoin network, long before NFTs and Web3.\n\nPredictive models from the New York Federal Reserve point to a 68% likelihood of a recession hitting within the next year, a daunting 30% leap from predictions just five months earlier.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry\u2019s reaction would largely depend on the root cause, duration and severity, according to Rich Rosenblum, CEO of market maker GSR.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a recession driven by a worsening of the banking crisis, it could end up a boon, as crypto is increasingly being seen as a viable alternative to legacy financial systems,\u201d he said. Rosenblum warned that projects would need to focus more on public sales over private deals, as institutional demand may dry up.\n\nIf a recession stems from persistent global economic weakness, survival could be challenging for crypto companies, especially those dependent on speculative inflows.\n\nTokens with real-world impact outside of the industry are likely to be more resilient, Rosenblum said.\n\nRecessions are getting shorter\n\nThe good news: The average length of a recession has declined over the centuries.\n\nGranted, the most recent US recession (which went for 18 months) was the longest since the Great Depression \u2014 almost 100 years ago, but:\n\nFrom 1854 to 1919, a typical recession lasted 21 quarters, or a bit more than five years, data from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1945, that average fell to 18 quarters, or four and a half years.\n\nModern day recessions are estimated to span 10 quarters, just two and a half years.\n\nStill, some allocators \u2014 like Akshat Vaidya, head of investments at Maelstrom, the debut fund of the family office of BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes \u2014 aren\u2019t confident that crypto could make it through unscathed.\n\nVaidya told Blockworks he expects crypto to move just like it did during the 2020 Covid crash, \u201cimplode along with the rest of the world come recession, as liquidity vanishes in the cascade of margin calls.\u201d\n\nThat could still lead to a positive outcome over the long term. After all, bitcoin skyrocketed more than 900% in the quarters following the 2020 recession, jumping from below $7,000 to as high as $69,000.\n\n\u201cNot only will high-quality projects survive, but they will thrive in the easy money policies that follow,\u201d he said, adding that investors focused on quality could see an opportunity to be \u201cgreedy when others are fearful.\u201d\n\nBitcoin halvings help crypto practice for recession\n\nSubstantial monetary stimulus worldwide during the pandemic renewed one of Bitcoin\u2019s primary value propositions: Hedging against inflation and currency devaluation.\n\nWith this in mind, one optimistic take is that bitcoin \u2014 which generally leads crypto markets \u2014 has historically operated in four-year cycles, on account of its halvings.\n\nPast performance around halvings may not strictly indicate future results, but predictable changes to bitcoin\u2019s issuance could help crypto investors plan to weather the storm.\n\n\u201cWith each halving event where the new supply of bitcoin is reduced by half; every halving event to date has preceded a significant increase in the bitcoin price as well as a correction to follow,\u201d Jesse Shrader, CEO at Lightining-focused startup Amboss Technologies, said.\n\nOn the other hand, government stimulus has shielded parts of more traditional industries, including leading up to and throughout the pandemic recession.\n\nWhile stimulus has made the business environment seem more stable, it\u2019s not clear whether the broader economy could withstand dramatic shocks without intervention.\n\nFor startups battling a prolonged recession, profit margins and cash flow remain critical, according to Terrence Yang, managing director at bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cCan you survive several months or even years of a recession? Now is a good time to evaluate whether you are credibly solving a big, urgent problem with a uniquely valuable solution,\u201d Yang said, adding that\u2019s something few cryptocurrencies have done.\n\nFor investors, Yang said bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals in the long-term remain unchanged, especially over horizons for longer than five years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "A standing committee comprised of various governmental ministries and the central bank of Saudi Arabia has warned that trading of \u2018unauthorized\u2019 cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is illegal in the country.\n\nIn a statement published by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) \u2013 the sovereign Arab state\u2019s deface central bank \u2013 on Sunday, a governmental committee declared it was against trading of cryptocurrencies. The reasons, it claimed, were due to \u201ctheir negative consequences and high risk on traders\u201d since they are beyond the purview of governmental supervision.\n\nFormed by a supreme decree, the standing committee was devised as a watchdog to specifically look into \u2018unauthorized securities activities in the foreign exchange market\u2019. It includes Saudi Arabia\u2019s Capital Market Authority (CMA), the Interior, Media, Commerce & Investment ministries as well as the SAMA. Pointedly, the supreme decree has tasked the committee to inform relevant authorities by reporting any trading or investments in forex and cryptocurrency trading as well as reducing their marketing activities to keep them from investors.\n\nIn a statement, the committee said:\n\n\u201cThe committee assured that virtual currency including, for example but not limited to, the Bitcoins are illegal in the kingdom and no parties or individuals are licensed for such practices. \u201c\n\nWithout indicating any penalties or fines for cryptocurrency trading, the committee insisted on warning \u201call citizens and residents\u201d against what is deemed an \u2018illegal\u2019 activity.\n\nAt the time of publishing, BitOasis \u2013 the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)\u2019s first bitcoin exchange \u2013 continues to list Saudi Arabia among its supported countries following its initial launch nearly two years ago. The exchange operator notably suspended fiat withdrawals citing an \u2018issue\u2019 with its banking partner in May. The exchange has changed tact ever since and has today announced the resumption of international fiat withdrawals.\n\nA representative for BitOasis did not return a request for comment at press time.\n\nCuriously, the SAMA is working on its own custom cryptocurrency for blockchain-powered cross-border transactions with the UAE\u2019s central bank. Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank is also using Ripple\u2019s blockchain software xCurrent \u2013 which doesn\u2019t use XRP \u2013 to plug regional banks on RippleNet, an enterprise blockchain network for instant payments.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "content": "Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin\u2019s marketing chief has stated that bitcoin price, despite these boom times, is \u201cundervalued.\u201d\n\nIn a televised interview with Bloomberg today, Gatecoin\u2019s marketing chief and head of business development for Asia Pacific Thomas Glucksmann was led onto the subject of bitcoin\u2019s \u201cfair value\u201d, at a time when prices are nearing $10,000 \u2013 a remarkable 10x gain since the turn of the year. The bitcoin executive professed the market remains relatively \u201cillogical\u201d compared to traditional financial assets where price predictions are analyzed over usual valuation metrics.\n\nAsked if it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to determine bitcoin\u2019s fair value, Glucksmann acknowledged and replied:\n\nI would still argue that it is highly, highly undervalued. If you look at the long-term potential of the technology in the next 10, 20, 30 years, $10,000 is cheap in my opinion.\n\nWhile bitcoin is now seen in the mainstream as a store of value among retail investors, it remains a peer-to-peer decentralized electronic cryptocurrency, a fact Glucksmann is keen to point out even if or when the cryptocurrency is valued at a million dollars. \u201cBitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places,\u201d the Gatecoin executive told the interviewer, referring to the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin, also known as Satoshis (0.00000001 BTC \u2013 a hundredth of a millionth BTC).\n\nHe stated:\n\nEven if one bitcoin is worth a $1,000,000, you could still have $1 USD worth of bitcoin which you could still transact peer-to-peer. It\u2019s important to look at bitcoin in that way with that longer-term view.\n\nAt press time, data from CoinmarketCap reveals bitcoin price trading at $9,927 and topping $165 billion in the total market value of all 16.7 million mined bitcoins.\n\nGatecoin, which lays claim to being the world\u2019s first exchange to list Ethereum\u2019s ether tokens in mid-2015, suffered major operational disruption in recent months after Hong Kong banks abruptly froze its accounts, forcing the exchange to suspend HKD and USD deposits from customers at a time when the exchange had \u2018tripled\u2019 its customer base following bitcoin\u2019s price gains. The exchange found respite with new banking partners in Europe and is scheduled to resume bank transfers in December.\n\nThe exchange also added support for Litecoin this month, enabling users to buy and sell the alternative cryptocurrency with bitcoin, ether and the Euro. In his remarks today, Glucksmann underlined Litecoin as an \u201cunderrated cryptocurrency\u201d that shares many similarities with bitcoin without suffering the same \u201cscaling issues\u201d that has often plagued its development and community.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "content": "Total daily Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin network fell to 282,467 on Tuesday from 374,037 on Sunday, but Bitcoin network congestion remains stubbornly high.\n\nThe slowing rate of new Ordinals, a form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin network, comes as the network surpassed 7 million inscriptions on Monday.\n\nWeekly Ordinals sales volume on the Bitcoin network fell 51.84% to US$37.8 million on Tuesday, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThere were 250,876 Bitcoin transactions waiting in line to be validated at 8:40 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to mempool.space data.\n\nThe network jam could be attributed to the red-hot growth of BRC-20 tokens, the fungible tokens standard built on the Ordinals protocol.\n\nThe number of different types of BRC-20s grew from 14,300 tokens on May 11 to 24,677 on Wednesday. BRC-20 tokens have a combined market capitalization of around half a billion dollars and have been increasing block space demand on the world\u2019s first modern blockchain, according to data provider BRC-20.io.\n\nThe persisting Bitcoin network congestion raised concerns about the effect of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens and their potential to clog the network, raising confirmation time and costs for regular Bitcoin transactions.\n\n\u201cOrdinals have slowed down a bit, and are taking a bit of a back seat to BRC-20s, and like you\u2019re seeing, they\u2019re behaving similarly and filling up the [memory pool],\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, an NFT strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but healthy for Bitcoin to see such tremendous activity, and its only threat is that it will drive the development of layer 2 solutions to help with scalability as we see on Ethereum already.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s network congestion can be measured by its memory pool size, or mempool, the queue of pending valid transactions waiting to be added to blocks. It is often measured in virtual bytes (vbytes), and a single Bitcoin block can theoretically hold up to a million vbytes.\n\nThe mempool size was at a near one-month high of 202.8 million vbytes as of 5:40 p.m. Hong Kong time. Bitcoin\u2019s mempool size stood at 3.31 million vbytes on April 24, according to on-chain data from mempool.space.\n\n\u201cI know some are complaining about keeping Bitcoin pure as just a currency, but that\u2019s old-world mentality,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThis is a decentralized blockchain and the people will use it exactly how it\u2019s intended to be used, which is free from censorship and free to use as they want.\u201d\n\nThe growing mempool size caused Bitcoin transaction fees to surge to a two-year high of US$30.91 on May 8, before retracing to US$5.6 at press time, according to Chicago-based financial data firm YCharts.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin dips to US$26,166 as memecoins flood the blockchain"

River did not disclose a valuation. It last raised capital in March 2021, when it secured $12 million in a round led by Goldcrest.\n\nHeadquartered in Columbus, Ohio, River offers a range of Bitcoin-related services, including a brokerage with zero-fee recurring orders, custody, mining and a wallet that supports on-chain and Lightning Network transactions. It also has an enterprise API that helps companies plug into the Lightning Network \u2014 a service relied on by El Salvador\u2019s Chivo Wallet, among others.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing another wave of Bitcoin interest, largely driven by business and institutional adoption,\u201d Alex Leishman, River\u2019s CEO, said in the statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not hype this time. This year\u2019s bank failures and bailouts have been a wake-up call, revealing the cracks of the traditional financial system and reminding us why Bitcoin is so important \u2014 it\u2019s a secure path to a stronger and more transparent global economy.\u201d\n\nBanks in crisis\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nA string of bank crises in the U.S. earlier this year \u2014 among them the collapse of crypto-friendly outfits like Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank \u2014 has contributed to a resurgence in the price of bitcoin.

The startup plans to use the funding injection to expand its consumer offering, as well as its Bitcoin banking solutions, Leishman said in an email. It will also continue to invest in its mining and Lightning infrastructure products.\n\n\u201cBy focusing on Bitcoin, we are able to go deep into things like mining and Lightning that multi-coin crypto companies cannot,\u201d he added."

        "content": "There has been a longer-ranging positive for recently-weak bitcoin prices. The number of addresses holding at least one bitcoin is now at an all-time high.\n\nThose are also known as \u201cwholecoiner\u201d addresses, and recent data from Glassnode confirms that as of May 13, the number of wholecoiners is at record highs. That implies smaller crypto market participants used the crypto winter of 2022 and this year\u2019s pullbacks to grow their bitcoin positions. Now, many such participants have gathered together enough of the digital currency to get to the much-ballyhooed \u201cone\u201d level.\n\nThe rise of wholecoiners is important because smaller bitcoin owners tend to hold the cryptocurrency for longer periods of time. This can somewhat dampen broader bitcoin market volatility. Because of small initial stakes, these market participants are unlikely to sell at the first big decline or depart into substantial rallies.\n\nRather, many wholecoiners take a long-term view of bitcoin and see value in incrementally building stakes and buying on dips. Additionally, we can assume a fair number of these market participants will continue to build their positions. They don\u2019t want to liquidate all of their bitcoin holdings just after reaching their personal price objectives.\n\nWholecoiner Details\n\nThere are now about one million wholecoiners holding at least one bitcoin. Alone, that\u2019s impressive, but there\u2019s more to the story that could be encouraging for crypto bulls.\n\n\u201cWhile the round number \u2018one million\u2019 marks a new notch in the record books, it\u2019s worth pointing out that one Bitcoin wallet address doesn\u2019t always represent a single person,\u201d reported Tom Mitchelhill for Cointelegraph. \u201cMany crypto investors have multiple Bitcoin addresses and other addresses belong to major institutions like cryptocurrency exchanges and investment firms that typically own large sums of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThere are other implications related to the buy-and-hold nature of these investors. As they hold bitcoin rather than trade it, this may support price appreciation. There is, after all, a finite amount of bitcoin, and much of it is permanently lost.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, a staggering 3 million BTC \u2014 worth $80.4 billion and accounting for 17% of the total circulating supply \u2014 are \u2018lost forever,\u2019 according to estimates from Glassnode, which draws the figure from a combination of data including BTC sent to \u2018burn addresses,\u2019 wallets with lost keys and large accounts that have remained untouched for more than a decade,\u201d noted Mitchelhill.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel.\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The European Union\u2019s sweeping set of beefed-up cryptocurrency rules got final approval from member states Tuesday, giving the 27-nation bloc a global lead in regulating the freewheeling sector.\n\nThe European Council adopted the package of rules \u2014 known as Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA \u2014 in the final step of the bloc\u2019s legislative process. European Parliament lawmakers endorsed the rules in April, and they\u2019re expected to start taking effect in phases starting in July 2024.\n\nThe tighter European scrutiny follows a spate of high profile crypto scandals including the collapse of trading firm FTX and the implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin.\n\nThe rules are aimed at improving transparency and combating money laundering and will cover stablecoins \u2014 which are usually tied to a hard currency or a commodity like gold that make them less volatile than normal cryptocurrencies.\n\nOther digital tokens as well as bitcoin-related services such as trading platforms and digital wallets are also subject to the rules, but not bitcoin itself.\n\n\u201cRecent events have confirmed the urgent need for imposing rules which will better protect Europeans who have invested in these assets, and prevent the misuse of crypto industry for the purposes of money laundering and financing of terrorism,\u201d said Swedish Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Council.\n\nUnder MiCA, which has been in the works since 2020, crypto companies will need approval to operate in the EU and be held liable if they lose investors\u2019 assets. Authorities will compile a public list of \u201cnoncompliant\u201d companies.\n\nANALYSIS: Crypto companies\u2019 ties to sports raise ethical questions\n\nThe rules, aimed at maintaining financial stability, include provisions to combat market manipulation and insider dealing. Companies issuing or trading crypto assets will have to disclose information on the risks, costs and charges that consumers face.\n\nMajor crypto companies will have to reveal how much energy they use. The massive amount of energy used in bitcoin mining to create new coins has stoked concern about crypto\u2019s carbon footbprint.\n\nThe U.S. has made little progress in stepping up oversight of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, while the U.K. is considering feedback on proposed crypto regulations that it outlined last year.\n\nSome European countries, like Germany, already have basic crypto regulations."

        "title": "The 3 Types of Cryptos That Could Outperform Bitcoin This Year - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Even with its recent pullback from the $30,000 price level, Bitcoin remains one of the top-performing cryptos of 2023. It is up 65% this year, and it's hard to find any large market-cap coins that can top this.\n\nBut savvy investors know it's best not to put all your eggs into one basket. If you are looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, here are three types of digital coins that could outperform Bitcoin this year.\n\n1. Potential Ethereum replacements\n\nWhile Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) continues to be the dominant Layer 1 blockchain in the crypto world, there are plenty of up-and-comers that hope to dethrone it. Three rivals that stand out are Solana, Aptos, and Fantom. Both Solana and Aptos are up more than 100% this year, and Fantom is not too far behind, at 93%.\n\nJudging from their performance, investors are not entirely convinced that Ethereum is going to retain its dominant role in so many key blockchain sectors, ranging from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). While The Merge helped to improve the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the core Ethereum blockchain, these blockchain rivals are still much faster and cheaper. That has huge implications in areas such as DeFi, where users are looking for near-zero fees and near-instantaneous settlement of transactions.\n\nOf these Ethereum rivals, my personal pick is Solana, which has been out-innovating Ethereum of late. For example, Solana recently launched the first-ever mobile phone for a major blockchain network (the Saga) and has been exploring new initiatives to leverage all the hype and excitement around artificial intelligence, including a new plug-in for ChatGPT. For Solana to outperform Bitcoin, it will need to show that mobile crypto and crypto AI are sustainable, long-term growth catalysts.\n\n2. Scaling solutions for Ethereum\n\nIf you are looking for a less risky way to outperform Bitcoin, then blockchain scaling solutions for Ethereum could be the answer. Simply stated, these scaling solutions sit on top of the main blockchain and help Ethereum process transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nFor that reason, they are referred to as Layer 2 solutions (i.e., they are the second layer on top of the base Ethereum layer). Each scaling solution uses its own form of proprietary technology to accomplish its goals, so it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate among these different solutions.\n\nIf you buy into the idea that these Layer 2 coins are essential to the future success of Ethereum, then there are a few key prospects to target, including Immutable, Optimism, and Polygon. The name that's probably most familiar to investors will be Polygon, which has been making waves recently with new NFT initiatives, including a high-profile partnership with Nike to create an entirely new NFT marketplace for digital sneakers. However, if you are craving maximum upside potential, a better pick might be Immutable, which is up a mind-blowing 99% this year.\n\n3. Cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum\n\nLastly, there are a growing number of cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum. Now that Ethereum has transformed from a proof-of-work blockchain into proof of stake, this is tremendously important. Crypto staking is suddenly big business, and investors are always looking for ways to earn the highest staking rewards possible.\n\nThe two big names to watch here are Lido DAO, which is up 95% this year, and Rocket Pool, which is up 157% this year. Both emerged from relative obscurity after The Merge due to the popularity of staking, and both now currently rank in the Top 50 cryptos in terms of market capitalization.\n\nWhich of these is the best buy?\n\nThe common theme of all three categories of cryptos detailed above is that they somehow involve Ethereum. The first category, for example, includes all those capable of displacing Ethereum one day as the preeminent Layer 1 blockchain. The second category includes all digital currencies helping Ethereum scale bigger and faster. And the third category includes all cryptos that involve staking on Ethereum.\n\nSo if the prospect of picking winners and losers in niche areas of the blockchain space seems too daunting, the classic buy-and-hold crypto is Ethereum, which is up a not-too-shabby 52% this year.\n\nBut if you're looking for a little extra turbocharging for your portfolio, then my best picks would be Solana and Polygon. I'm long-term bullish on both of them, and I still regard both as best-in-class for their respective blockchain categories."

There are some signs of frothiness,\" said Noelle Acheson, author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter.\n\nSpecifically, earlier this month ether briefly rallied and the Bitcoin blockchain saw a record high in daily transactions amid a surge in interest around memecoins and NFT-like tokens on the Bitcoin network called ordinals.\n\n\"In spite of these hints of froth, activity is low,\" Acheson added. \"Prices are down more than 10% on the month, and volumes are trending lower.\"\n\nBitcoin and ether continued to hover around the flat line Wednesday at the $27,000 and $1,800 levels, respectively."

        "content": "On May 17\u2019s episode of The Market Report, analyst and writer Marcel Pechman discusses whether Bitcoin (BTC) is safer than the United States dollar, considering the risk of the U.S. government defaulting on its debt. He also covers why Bitcoin\u2019s $28,000 resistance will not be a walk in the park and, finally, what is happening between Celsius, Ethereum and Lido staking. The show airs every Tuesday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nThe first news article covered discusses a Bloomberg Markets survey showing Bitcoin as a top three asset in the event of a U.S. debt default. For Pechman, it is no surprise that Bitcoin trumps fiat currencies in investors\u2019 picks, considering the central banks from the eurozone, Japan, Canada, England and Switzerland boosted their borrowing programs from the U.S. Federal Reserve in March 2023. There\u2019s a high correlation to fiat currencies, putting the asset class at significant risk if a U.S. debt default happens.\n\nPechman predicts that investors\u2019 allocations in gold would be 10x higher than Bitcoin\u2019s due to the cryptocurrency\u2019s lower market capitalization and high volatility. On the positive side, 11% of retail investors would add Bitcoin to their portfolio in the event of a government shutdown versus 46% for gold. What are the odds of Bitcoin breaking above $100,000 in the case of a government shutdown? No spoilers \u2014 check the show.\n\nOn to the show\u2019s next topic: Pechman discusses why Bitcoin\u2019s $28,000 resistance will likely prove stronger than expected. The recent correction down to $25,800 was probably caused by high transaction fees, but Pechman argues that the network worked exactly as intended and that high fees are the network\u2019s defense against spamming.\n\nThe problem holding back a quick recovery above $28,000 is professional traders\u2019 positioning using derivatives. Before the event, whales and market makers were already neutral-to-bearish.\n\nIn the final part of The Market Report, Pechman explains failed crypto lending platform Celsius\u2019 $780 million Ether (ETH) movement from the Lido staking platform. No one knows if the Ether will be sold at market and eventually paid out in U.S. dollars to Celsius creditors\n\nDon\u2019t miss out!

        "title": "Bitcoin price capitulation below $26K possible as Friday's BTC options expiry looms - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price lost steam after a failed rupture of the $27,500 resistance on May 15, putting bears in a better position for the May 19 expiry. The regulatory newsflow likely played a key role in trimming investors\u2019 risk appetite, as governments seek more control over the sector.\n\nIn a memo circulated among committee members, Democrats in the United States legislature sought to cement the Securities and Exchange Committee\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) authority over crypto. The document was made public on May 10 and included the argument that nearly all digital assets constitute securities. Moreover, according to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s view, even network nodes are in violation of securities laws.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Treasury Committee \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d on May 17 regulating retail crypto trading and investment activity as gambling, consistent with the principle of \u201csame risk, same regulatory outcome.\u201d Treasury Committee Chair Harriett Baldwin described Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as accounting for two-thirds of the total market capitalization of crypto assets, both of which she claimed are \u201cunbacked.\u201d\n\nThe $735 million Bitcoin weekly options expiry on May 19 might play a decisive role in determining whether the price will capitulate by falling below $26,000.\n\nBitcoin could be making a short-term bottom\n\nBitcoin bears will try to take advantage of the negative regulatory environment and uncertainty caused by the risk of the U.S. Treasury \u201crunning out of funds\u201d as the debt ceiling approaches. Such a pessimistic scenario partially explains why some Bitcoin traders decided to reduce exposure over the past couple of weeks.\n\nBitcoin 4-hour price movements during options expiries. Source: TradingView\n\nThe Bitcoin price traded down 6.6% in the 36 hours that preceded the latest BTC options expiry on May 12, marking a short-term bottom on the four-hour chart. More importantly, the subsequent three-day rally toward $27,500 was short-lived, favoring the thesis of bearish momentum.\n\nBitcoin options data shows bulls were excessively optimistic\n\nThe open interest for the May 19 options expiry is $735 million, but the actual figure will be lower since bulls concentrated their wagers above $28,000. These traders got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin\u2019s price gained 7% between May 12 and May 15, testing the $27,500 resistance.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for May 19. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 0.42 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $424 million in call (buy) open interest and the $312 million in put (sell) options. However, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $26,500 at 8:00 am UTC on May 19, only $30 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nRelated: Tether to buy Bitcoin based on monthly net profits\n\nBitcoin bulls aim for $27,000 to balance the scales\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on May 19 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price.\n\nThe imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $25,000 and $26,000: 100 calls vs. 7,800 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $190 million.\n\n100 calls vs. 7,800 puts. Bears in total control, profiting $190 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 1,100 calls vs. 4,300 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $80 million.\n\n1,100 calls vs. 4,300 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $80 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 2,300 calls vs. 2,000 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options.\n\n2,300 calls vs. 2,000 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 5,700 calls vs. 700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $140 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the put options used in bearish bets and the call options exclusively in neutral-to-bullish trades. This oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor instance, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nStill, traders should be cautious as the bears are currently in a better position for Friday\u2019s weekly options expiry, favoring negative price moves. Thus, an eventual capitulation below $26,000 should not be discarded.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

A nugget of blockchain history was unearthed this weekend when internet sleuths uncovered the first documented financial transaction on the world\u2019s first blockchain. In January 2010, a user named Sabunir decided to try Bitcoin, and as a test, sold a digital picture for US$1 in Bitcoin.\n\nWas this the world\u2019s first NFT sale? No, but it is a perfect example of the use case of NFTs; preserving the provenance and ownership history of literally anything digital (not just a jpeg).\n\nThis 500 BTC jpeg sale would be worth about US$13.7 million today. Had the image been tokenized as an NFT, it would have gone down as the most significant NFT in history. If the image is recovered in the future, it would hold no value. But if it started as an NFT, the world would know exactly which copy was the original, and one lucky person would have generational wealth from it.\n\nIn the past 30 days, Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20s have turned the OG blockchain into the blockchain with the second-highest sales volume in the world. Bitcoin NFTs are just getting started and in the long run, I expect Bitcoin to compete head-to-head with Ethereum\u2019s all-time sales. It may actually exceed them too.\n\nOrdinals\n\nMythos Chain is also doing big numbers, as people are beginning to take notice of the gaming blockchain and their impressive products. I\u2019m a gamer and didn\u2019t know until recently that they have the world\u2019s largest CS:GO skins secondary market along with new hit NFL Rivals, Blankos Block Party and more on the horizon.\n\nFun fact: There is a gaming blockchain doing the 3rd most NFT volume this week.\n\n\n\nMore than Solana, Polygon, Immutable and co.\n\n\n\nFun thing is, all the volume is in CSGO skin sales which are recorded on the blockchain.\n\n\n\nSadly it's not through web3 games (yet) pic.twitter.com/udDeU7clT9 \u2014 apix\ud83c\udfae (@apixtwts) May 13, 2023\n\nAt the time of this writing, three of the top 10 collections in 24 hours are all gaming NFTs, and the biggest game makers like Square Enix, Ubisoft, Konomi and Atari are only just now beginning to touch NFTs.\n\nStory continues\n\nLots are going on outside of the NFT markets. NFT communities and those who build them are preparing to descend on the second annual VeeCon conference this week, as Gary Vaynerchuck again shows the world the pinnacle of Web3. Those who believe NFTs can function as access passes, art, and collectibles all in one are in for a treat when, what I call the State of the NFTs, kicks off at Lucas Oil Stadium on May 18. CryptoSlam will be there shaking hands and filling our brains with all of the latest happenings in NFTs. It\u2019s going to be a special time and we\u2019re hoping to get to meet some of you there!\n\nI\u2019m expecting markets to be slow while many are off networking, but we also know that degens are going to degen. Keep your eyes on cryptoslam.io, the Forkast 500 NFT Index, and our ETH, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano composites to see how the market is affected when many in the space take a break from trading."

        "title": "Can you recover stolen Bitcoin from crypto scams? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The process of recovering stolen Bitcoin (BTC) from cryptocurrency scams is difficult and complex. The prevalence of cryptocurrencies has led to an increase in scams and other fraudulent practices that prey on the gullible. Numerous people have suffered significant financial losses as a result of falling for different crypto scams, such as phishing, rug pulls and hacker attacks.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized and pseudonymous structure have some benefits, they also create major obstacles for recovering stolen funds. This article will delve into the various methods and potential avenues for recovering stolen Bitcoin and explore the important factors to consider in the process.\n\nUnderstanding the landscape of DeFi scams\n\nAs already noted, there are many different types of decentralized finance (DeFi) scams, including phishing scams, rug pulls and social media scams. To trick and take advantage of gullible people, scammers use strategies such as impersonation, bogus websites and misleading investment possibilities.\n\nThese frauds have an enormous effect, leading to monetary losses, compromising personal data and diminishing confidence in the cryptocurrency sector. To avoid being a victim of fraud, it is crucial to be aware of these frauds and comprehend their strategies.\n\nRelated: DeFi Scams 101: How to avoid the most common cryptocurrency frauds\n\nThe challenges of recovering stolen Bitcoin\n\nDue to the intrinsic properties of blockchain transactions, recovering stolen Bitcoin presents a number of difficulties. These transactions\u2019 pseudonymity and anonymity make it challenging to track the flow of money and pin down the offenders.\n\nFurthermore, jurisdictional issues and the decentralized nature of blockchain technology make the recovery process more challenging. Additionally, recovering the stolen Bitcoin is extremely difficult due to the technical challenges of locating and identifying stolen money. However, the avenues discussed below may help recover stolen BTC.\n\nLegal avenues for recovery\n\nVictims of Bitcoin theft can report the occurrence to law enforcement organizations that focus on cybercrime. The likelihood of recovery is increased by collaborating closely with specialized task forces and specific cybercrime teams. Coordination across several jurisdictions is made possible by international collaboration and the presence of legislative frameworks, which speed up the recovery process.\n\nBlockchain analytics and investigation techniques\n\nBlockchain analysis is essential for retrieving Bitcoin that has been stolen. These methods and technologies aid in tracing the movement of money, locating addresses connected to the fraud, and spotting erroneous transactions.\n\nCollaborating with cybersecurity companies experienced in blockchain investigation and forensic professionals improves the chances of finding and retrieving the stolen BTC. Untangling the complications of stolen Bitcoin and maybe recovering the funds for victims is made possible by combining technological know-how and investigation techniques.\n\nThe role of exchanges and service providers\n\nThe recovery of stolen Bitcoin depends heavily on exchanges and service providers. Authorities might start the recovery process by freezing the funds linked to the scam and working with reliable exchanges. To stop unauthorized transactions and improve user protection, exchanges must put more stringent security measures in place, including multi-factor authentication and strong Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.\n\nSeeking restitution through civil litigation\n\nCryptocurrency scam victims may pursue compensation through civil litigation. To successfully navigate the legal process, it is crucial to work with legal professionals with experience in situations involving cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s crucial to keep in mind that civil action can be difficult and drawn out, and there might be difficulties in identifying and locating the con artists or recovering the stolen funds. Depending on the jurisdiction and applicable legislation, legal remedies may vary.\n\nRelated: How to mitigate the security risks associated with crypto payments\n\nPrevention and education\n\nPrevention is the key to thwarting cryptocurrency fraud. People and organizations can better defend themselves from falling for such scams by increasing awareness and education about the hazards and typical fraudster tactics. Being a target of cryptocurrency scams can be greatly decreased by putting into use best practices for protecting Bitcoin holdings, such as using hardware wallets, updating software and exercising caution when doing online transactions."

        "content": "The tide might have gone out on Bitcoin Ordinals, but there\u2019s a strong undercurrent of investments in Bitcoin-only companies. River, a United States-based Bitcoin (BTC) technology and financial services company, is the latest to make a splash.\n\nRiver announced a $35 million Series B equity funding round despite the bear market. Kingsway Capital led the round, with notable contributions from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Cygni, Goldcrest and Valor Equity Partners.\n\nAccording to Alex Leishman, the CEO of River, the new wave of Bitcoin interest is \u201clargely driven by business and institutional adoption.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fueled by hype. This year\u2019s bank failures and bailouts have been a wake-up call, revealing the cracks of the traditional financial system and reminding us why Bitcoin is so important \u2014 it\u2019s a secure path to a stronger and more transparent global economy.\"\n\nThe San Francisco-based company manages one of the largest Bitcoin Lightning nodes, enabling payments and managing liquidity for the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\nTop Bitcoin Lightning nodes by capacity.

The service has already taken charge of one of the key players in the Bitcoin payments landscape; El Salvador\u2019s Chivo Wallet uses River for near-instant and near-free Bitcoin payments.\n\nRiver was an early adopter of the Lightning Network, similar to global crypto exchanges like Bitfinex and Kraken.\n\nA snapshot of the River Lightning node's capacity and connected channels. Source: Mempool.space\n\nMoreover, the world\u2019s largest exchanges \u2014 Coinbase and Binance \u2014 may soon adopt Lightning as the world slowly warms up to the low-fee, high-throughput payments network. At the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London, River CEO Leishman told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cI still think that we are very early. Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of cool things happening. We\u2019re building this really amazing foundation protocol-wise.\"\n\nHe said that it\u2019s important to see more people \u201cworking backward from the real human problems as well. We need more of that.\u201d In light of the surge in mainchain transaction fees due to memecoin mania, more and more exchanges and crypto companies may turn to the Lightning Network as a solution.\n\nRelated: The state of the Bitcoin Lightning Network in 2023\n\nRiver joins a burgeoning list of Bitcoin companies making raises during the bear market.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Really a Viable Alternative to Fiat Currencies? - TipRanks.com - TipRanks",
        "content": "When regional banks first started showing risks of failure in March, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) initially fell sharply. However, BTC and other cryptocurrencies bounced sharply higher under the reasoning that blockchain-derived assets provide an alternative to the fiat currency system, which appears to be fracturing. Nevertheless, investors must beware of the logical fallacy at play. I am neutral on Bitcoin and other cryptos.\n\nTo be clear, Bitcoin certainly earned its place as a legitimate arena for speculation. Unfortunately, market participants can end up getting burned associating BTC as a viable alternative to the U.S. dollar. Instead, cryptos can help boost one\u2019s portfolio in a short timeframe, assuming entry at the right price. Such volatility and unpredictability make BTC perfect for gamblers but not ideal as a \u201csovereign\u201d currency.\n\nThe Blockchain Does Provide an Alternative\n\nIn all fairness, the blockchain certainly provides an alternative to the fiat currency system. As TipRanks contributor Reuben Jackson pointed out, while some crypto projects tied to centralized business mechanisms suffered collapses, truly decentralized networks avoided the pain.\n\nEssentially, poor (human) management can create vulnerabilities, eventually leading to insolvency. On the other hand, decentralized networks require public consensus, preventing (in theory) the materialization of incompetence. Put another way, the existence of smart individuals can prevent imprudent decisions from moving forward.\n\nHowever, such a protocol begs the basic question: what prevents incompetent or immoral individuals from forming a majority consensus?\n\nIt\u2019s an uncomfortable notion for Americans, in particular, because the U.S. education system teaches that \u201cevery vote counts.\u201d While technically true, not every voter should vote, and that\u2019s because moral equivalency does not exist for every forwarded idea. Otherwise, societies can quickly break down as vile ideologies that tickle the reptilian part of the human brain gain scale.\n\nRegarding the fiat currency system, Americans entrust financial experts to best guide monetary policy. It\u2019s not perfect. However, the blockchain alternative \u2013 to have every decision be the result of public consensus \u2013 would amount to pure madness.\n\nSo yes, Bitcoin and cryptos represent an alternative to fiat currencies. However, being an alternative alone does not make it a better solution.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Volatility Hurts Its Viability\n\nAnother reason to be careful when considering Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat-currency-based systems centers on its volatility. Given that BTC and other cryptos can accelerate (or decelerate) sharply and randomly, the possibility of life-changing returns attracts speculators. At the same time, this volatility negates Bitcoin\u2019s ability to mostly be anything other than digitalized gambling.\n\nEven more telling, intense volatility is exactly what sparked concerns with publicly-traded securities of regional banks lately. As TipRanks reporter Shrilekha Pethe pointed out, this financial subsegment incurred crypto-like volatility. Well, if volatility is such a universally desired characteristic, bank stocks should rise, not fade like they\u2019re currently doing.\n\nAs well, if Bitcoin genuinely represented an alternative to the traditional banking system, BTC should be rising amid the latest chaotic incidents in the sector. However, that\u2019s not what traders are seeing at the moment. In the trailing one-month period through May 12, the iShares US Regional Banks ETF (NYSEARCA:IAT) lost 15.5% of its market value. During the same period, BTC declined by about 8.9%.\n\nOf course, as stated earlier, the price of Bitcoin and many other cryptos jumped from early March to mid-April. Since then, the narrative has been cloudy. However, if the blockchain offered a true alternative, BTC should be rising even more as chaos in the banks accelerates.\n\nFiat Headwinds Also Impact Cryptos\n\nPerhaps the biggest fallacy associated with overenthusiasm for Bitcoin is the concept that troubles for the traditional fiat-based system spell automatic upside for cryptos. In reality, both entities bat for the same team.\n\nTo extend the baseball analogy, BTC is the batter on deck, with the game at the bottom of the ninth and two outs on the board. While Bitcoin might have a rivalry with the fiat-based system that\u2019s currently at bat, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for blockchain proponents to wish ill on the fiat system. Obviously, if the batter strikes out, the game is over.\n\nSimilarly, investors shouldn\u2019t assume that banking sector woes translate to good tidings for Bitcoin. Look, if people start losing their jobs and the economy slips into a deep recession, BTC\u2019s valuation will likely fall due to a lack of market participants.\n\nThe Takeaway: Bitcoin Does Well In Its Lane\n\nFundamentally, Bitcoin does very well in its lane. As a highly-mobile asset, very few assets come close to BTC for sheer excitement and the possibility of quick life-changing returns. At the same time, the characteristics that traders love about Bitcoin make it inappropriate as a viable alternative to the fiat monetary system. Therefore, it\u2019s better to approach BTC with a clear head and common sense rather than cute internet stories.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "by Jennifer Nash, 5/17/23\n\nThis weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this article began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nXRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe Latest Data (through May 16, 2023)\n\nBitcoin continued its decline this past week, dropping below $27,000 for the first time in almost 2 months. Despite the second consecutive weekly fall, Bitcoin is up ~63% year-to-date.\n\nXRP fell to $0.42 during this past week, its lowest level since the end of March, and is currently up ~26% year-to-date.\n\nEther (ETH) fell below $1,800 for the first time since the beginning of April during this past week. Despite the decline, ETH is up ~51% year-to-date.\n\nI have also created an index in order to chart these together given their very different pricing history. Ether tops the chart \u2013 the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "title": "The NSA Has Been Tracking Bitcoin Users, Snowden Papers Reveals - CCN.com",
        "content": "Not to be mistaken for another Jason Bourne thriller, the Edward Snowden papers show a US government/bitcoin connection. The Intercept is reporting classified documents leaked by Snowden prove that the US National Security Agency (NSA) in fact was keeping tabs on bitcoin users globally, as evidenced by a report that\u2019s surfaced from March 2013. The timing is curious, with the ink barely dry on an executive order signed by President Trump to ban Americans from transacting with Venezuela\u2019s Petro coin.\n\nIn true spy agency style, the report is filled with code names and numbers as well as the cataloging and cross-referencing of data that ultimately helped them to \u201ctrack down the senders and receivers of bitcoins,\u201d top secret excerpts reveal. The NSA called its bitcoin spying project Oakstar, and the initial focus of the mission was counterterrorism-focused.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that the NSA was randomly targeting people. They at least appear to have been monitoring groups that were using the level of anonymity allowed by bitcoin transactions for clandestine purposes, such as money laundering activities. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what a top-secret NSA entry looks like, here\u2019s a glimpse:\n\n\u201c[NSA agent] is hoping to use the access for their mission of looking at organized crime and cyber targets that utilize online e-currency services to move and launder money. These illicit finance networks provide user access to international monetary systems while providing a high degree of anoymity.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how it went down. The NSA was seemingly able to use the sophisticated tools available to the US spy agency to collect and analyze internet data, capabilities that were bolstered by let\u2019s call it a super software program that protected the identity of users.\n\nBitcoin was one of three areas of activity that were being watched, in addition to Liberty Reserve, which has since been shuttered amid money laundering with cryptocurrencies, and one other. Even though bitcoin isn\u2019t the most anonymous cryptocurrency out there, it was the \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d of the NSA.\n\nNetwork Access\n\nWhile the blockchain is a public ledger, the NSA didn\u2019t stop there. They apparently gained access to user computer systems, collecting information such as passwords, user sessions and a media access control address. They also seem to have captured personal info such as billing details and IP addresses. The agency was set on uncovering the connection between what they called \u201cbitcoin targets\u201d and the data they had.\n\nAs for the timing of the reveal, it could just be a coincidence. But regardless, the more that the government tries to get its grips on the blockchain movement, the more it seems to only embolden the cryptocurrency community to distance themselves further from the centralized financial system.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "content": "In its latest futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing, Valkyrie Funds utilizes one of the popular memes from the financial Twitter community, known as \u201cfintwit,\u201d to capture attention and interest.\n\nOn May 16, the investment firm submitted a new application for a Bitcoin (BTC) futures-based ETF to be listed on the Nasdaq with the ticker symbol \u201cBTFD.\u201c\n\nBoth of Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin-centric funds do not have direct exposure to Bitcoin itself; instead, they invest in Bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Bitcoin futures are financial contracts that allow investors to speculate on the future price movements of Bitcoin. These contracts obligate the buyer to purchase or the seller to sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Unlike trading Bitcoin \u2014 which involves owning and holding the digital asset itself \u2014 Bitcoin futures enable traders to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without directly owning it.\n\nInitially intended for the first fund, the suggestive ticker was reportedly modified by the firm in October 2021.\n\nIn contrast to the firm\u2019s existing block trading facility (BTF) fund, this newly proposed fund will offer leverage, allowing speculators to increase their exposure to the dominant cryptocurrency. A BTF is an actively managed ETF available through Nasdaq that invests primarily in Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nUp to this point, the market has witnessed the introduction of four distinct Bitcoin futures-based ETFs. The first, ProShares Bitcoin Futures ETF, was launched in October 2021.\n\nThus far, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has denied several attempts to introduce Bitcoin spot ETFs or funds that provide direct exposure to the dominant cryptocurrency, citing concerns regarding potential market manipulation in the Bitcoin market.\n\nRelated: Breaking: Court victory for Ripple as judge denies SEC motion to seal Hinman docs\n\nDigital asset manager Grayscale is currently involved in a prolonged legal dispute with the SEC as it seeks to transform its struggling Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a Bitcoin spot ETF. The investment firm criticized the SEC\u2019s decision to authorize futures-based ETFs instead of spot ETFs, deeming it \u201cillogical.\u201c\n\nIn March, the judges presiding over the dispute between the two entities in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit expressed the view that the SEC \u201cmust provide a thorough explanation\u201d regarding its understanding of the connection between Bitcoin futures and the spot price of Bitcoin.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?"

        "content": "Michael Saylor is the CEO of MicroStrategy. In this interview, we discuss his 10 tips for young adults, the opportunities and threats of AI, the importance of Bitcoin in an automated world, the strength of ossification compared to accelerating change, and the criticality of Bitcoin miners to the Bitcoin network. We also talk about Michael\u2019s navigation of the bear market.\n\n- - - -\n\nChat GPT was released a little over 6 months ago. It is arguably the most significant tech innovation since the internet. People are now routinely using chatbots to interact with technology and access information tailored to very specific needs. Whilst the impacts of this are yet to be fully understood, it is widely accepted that we have entered a new exciting and equally frightening paradigm.\n\nThe issue at hand is that the world is becoming increasingly automated. As a result, human beings are being viewed as a constraint on productivity, which AI technology can mitigate. Where does this leave humans? In a world predicated on code and efficiency and automation, what controls are in place to ensure these systems are secure such that they can not be centralised and exploited such that the general population suffers rather than flourishes?\n\nMichael Saylor is of the opinion we need an automated tool that is secure and outside of any centralised control. Bitcoin, in this scenario, is the tool that can compete with new digital advances, but, enable humans to retain some control of their lives. As such, it is imperative that we protect the integrity of the innovation such that its utility remains available for both existing and future generations.\n\nThe question then becomes how do we best protect Bitcoin? Saylor argues that it is the Bitcoin miners that are Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cfortresses\u201d: they provide brute force security, a cryptographic defence, and the means to marshall the means to advocate effectively for Bitcoin within the corridors of power. Bitcoin miners, therefore, need protection to ensure they continue to act as Bitcoin\u2019s standing army. We do this by ensuring stability: ossifying Bitcoin\u2019s base layer protocol."

        "title": "Wall Street legend and billionaire T. Jones on Bitcoin: 'I'm gonna always stick with it' - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "While the cryptocurrency industry has become a hot issue among regulators, American billionaire and hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has said that he was going to hold on to the Bitcoin (BTC) he had purchased earlier because of the features that make it stand out from all the other assets in his portfolio.\n\nIndeed, Jones praised the finite supply of Bitcoin as its pivotal characteristic that made him decide to hold on to it for longer than any other asset, as the hedge fund billionaire explained in an interview at CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box published on May 15.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never sat on a horse that long. (\u2026) From the beginning, I always said I wanted to have a small allocation to it because it\u2019s a great tale of it, it\u2019s the only thing that humans can\u2019t adjust the supply in, so I\u2019m sticking with it. I\u2019m gonna always stick with it. It\u2019s just a small diversification in my portfolio.\u201d\n\nNotably, back in October 2022, Jones had expressed his belief that crypto assets would have a much higher value at some point in the future, especially at a time when there is too much money, thanks to their scarcity, and that this value would be far more than it was at the time.\n\nAsked by the host whether he would buy more Bitcoin, Jones said that cryptocurrencies have \u201cdone so well recently because of the fact that we have had these great risk premiums,\u201d but he did wonder \u201cwhether they may not be boring in the future.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s problem\n\nAs for Bitcoin in particular, he believes that it \u201chas a real problem because in the United States, you have the entire regulatory apparatus against it, so it\u2019s just kinda yesterday\u2019s news, and if inflation\u2019s truly done a bit, if that story\u2019s been played, then you have to wonder.\u201d In his words:\n\n\u201cWe were buying gold and Bitcoin for the inflation hedges \u2013 that game may be over. Six months ago, before AI, before the possible productivity boost that will go with it, I would\u2019ve said a completely different story with regard to the inflationary future and with regard to all the inflation hedges.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at the price of $27,204, down 0.72% in the last 24 hours, as well as 1.40% across the previous seven days, adding up to the losses of 10.43% on its monthly chart, according to the latest information retrieved by Finbold on May 16.\n\nWatch the entire video below:"

        "title": "Crypto trading should be treated like a type of gambling, influential MPs say - Sky News",
        "content": "An influential panel of MPs has called on the government to regulate consumer crypto trading and speculation as a type of gambling.\n\nThe cross-party Treasury Committee claimed digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ether have \"no intrinsic value and no useful social purpose\" - and as well as consuming large amounts of energy, they are often used by criminals for scams.\n\nIt comes after the government announced proposals in February to regulate the crypto industry by bringing it under financial services law.\n\nBut MPs said a better approach would be to recognise how speculation in unbacked cryptoassets - like Bitcoin - \"more closely resembles gambling than a financial service\".\n\nIt recommended that safeguarding rules which oversee the likes of lotteries, betting firms and casinos should apply instead.\n\nAround 10% of UK adults have speculated in cryptoassets, according to HM Revenue and Customs.\n\nThe committee's new report warned digital currencies are a \"significant risk\" due to \"huge\" price volatility, with the potential for customers to lose everything they invest.\n\nIt said there was evidence that addictions to cryptocurrency speculation were on the rise - and warned there are limited controls currently in place to protect vulnerable consumers.\n\nMPs said they were concerned that bringing the industry under financial service regulation \"will create a 'halo' effect that leads consumers to believe that this activity is safer than it is, or protected when it is not\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We therefore strongly recommend that the government regulates retail trading and investment activity in unbacked cryptoassets as gambling rather than as a financial service, consistent with its stated principle of 'same risk, same regulatory outcome,'\" the report added.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:14 What is the main aim of cryptocurrency?\n\nA 'Wild West' industry\n\nIt comes after a 2018 report by the committee described the cryptocurrency industry as a \"Wild West\" - with MPs saying nothing in their subsequent enquiries had moved them to alter that verdict.\n\nFollowing the new report, committee chair, Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, said: \"Effective regulation is clearly needed to protect consumers from harm, as well as to support productive innovation in the UK's financial services industry.\n\n\"However, with no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such.\"\n\nThe MPs said they still felt there was potential in the technology - such as by improving the efficiency and costs of making payments - and advised the government to take a \"balanced approach\" in supporting innovation.\n\nThe committee added it was separately considering the potential role of digital currencies backed by central banks.\n\nMeanwhile its report also criticised the government's attempt in April 2022 to launch a non-fungible token (NFT) - a type of cryptocurrency asset - through the Royal Mint. The plan was dropped earlier this year following a review.\n\nMPs said the government \"should seek to avoid expending public resources on supporting cryptoasset activities without a clear, beneficial use case\".\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 5:26 Is the crypto crisis over?\n\nCrypto 'offers opportunities'\n\nIt comes as the government considers responses to a consultation into its regulation proposals.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson indicated ministers would likely reject the committee's recommendation.\n\nThey told Sky News: \"Risks posed by crypto are typical of those that exist in traditional financial services and it's financial services regulation - rather than gambling regulation - that has the track record in mitigating them.\n\n\"Crypto offers opportunities but we are taking an agile approach to robustly regulating the market, addressing the most pressing risks first in a way that promotes innovation.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nThe report comes amid growing pressure on governments around the world to better regulate the industry, heightened by the sudden bankruptcy of crypto platform FTX in November.\n\nSome 80,000 UK-based customers were impacted by the collapse, and one British investor was left with a \u00a31m hole in his finances.\n\nThe European Union this week approved tougher cryptoasset rules - including new powers to ban exchanges that fail to protect consumers.\n\nThe International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), whose members include regulators in the US and UK, said it will also soon announce proposals for the first ever set of global rules covering crypto trading."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction 2023 Points to All-Time High Level - Crypto Times",
        "content": "The leading cryptocurrency-Bitcoin is showing signs of bullish momentum this year, overcoming a significant decline in price during 2022. Finally, the buyers seem to be breaking free from the grasp of the sellers.\n\nWhile Bitcoin faced resistance at the $30,000 level, the market sentiment is optimistic. According to analysis of various factors, such as price structure and technical indicators, there is a likelihood of increased buying activity in the near future. This trend could lead Bitcoin to achieve new heights and perhaps reach its previous all-time high.\n\nA well-known crypto analyst, Credible, recently shared an exciting prediction with his vast Twitter following of 340.5K followers. He emphasized that the price of Bitcoin is poised to soar toward its record-breaking high of $69,000.\n\nWhile gaps are often filled- especially in choppy, corrective environments- when market conditions shift and we begin trending, gaps are often left behind until the impulse completes. If we are as bullish as I think we are, the gap at 20k may not be filled anytime soon. $BTC pic.twitter.com/w6NA1yaKQJ \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) March 18, 2023\n\nExpressing concern, Credible has brought attention to a significant $20,000 gap, noticing that he does not anticipate it being closed in the near future. With a compelling thesis, he has caught the attention of many by highlighting the potential for BTC to reach $70K, boldly stating that the gap is unlikely to be filled.\n\nWhen asked about the order of milestones, \u201c$20,000 or $70,000+,\u201d Credible confidently states, \u201c$70,000+.\u201d This indicates his strong belief in Bitcoin reaching the ATH mark. However, amidst the ongoing market turbulence, buyers are facing consistent rejections at $30K, leading some investors to question Credible\u2019s words and hesitate to fully rely on them.\n\nCredible made it clear that buyers could find themselves in a challenging situation if Bitcoin\u2019s price goes on a sustained bull run without proper consolidation. This unexpected twist aligns perfectly with the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cToo convenient and easy to let everyone who got rinsed over the past 6 months reload their positions and happily ride to new ATH in time with the halving.\u201d\n\nDespite already experiencing an impressive 60% gain from its 2023 low, Bitcoin\u2019s price still offers investors a significant opportunity to embark on a bullish journey with BTC. There is substantial room for growth, as current projections indicate the potential for over 150% growth from the current price level to reach the ATH region.\n\nAccording to Credible\u2019s tweet, \u201cover 70% of all $BTC in existence concentrated in wallets that didn\u2019t puke at the 3AC or FTX collapses.\u201d These holders have a historical track record of not selling substantial amounts until all-time highs are reached. This promising sign hints majority of BTC remains in strong hands.\n\nThe zig-zag price momentum is gearing up to come to a halt, with the potential for bulls to break through the $30K resistance level. An encouraging indication is that the current price is sitting comfortably above the 200-week simple moving average, signaling a strong bullish sentiment.\n\nAlthough, the Bitcoin predictions of Credible are correct to some extent, but the price rally of $40,000 points in just 7 months makes things a bit tricky."

        "content": "As Bitcoin Pizza Day approaches, the Bitcoin community finds itself embroiled in a spirited discussion surrounding one of the earliest Bitcoin transactions, speculating whether it involved the purchase of a mere JPEG.\n\nThis Twitter Space was FIRE\n\n\n\nWe discovered that:\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 the first purchase EVER with bitcoin was buying a JPEG for 500 BTC in Feb 2010\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 it pre-dates the the famous 10,000 BTC pizza\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 satoshi himself helped facilitate the JPEG sale\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25 laser-eye cult in absolute SHAMBLES pic.twitter.com/b6ESOkbf0i \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) May 14, 2023\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day, commemorated on May 22, marks the historic moment when Bitcoin (BTC) was first utilized for a commercial transaction. However, the Twitterverse is currently abuzz with a screenshot from a Bitcoin forum, fueling speculation and curiosity among enthusiasts.\n\nThe screenshot in question reveals an intriguing proposal made by a user named Sabunir back in January 2010. Eager to experiment with Bitcoin transactions, Sabunir expressed his willingness to sell a desktop wallpaper for a staggering 500 BTC, valued at approximately $5 at the time.\n\nIn his post, Sabunir provided explicit instructions for interested buyers, stating that upon sending the coins, they should send him a Private Message specifying the time of the transaction. In response, Sabunir promised to reply with a link to the coveted image, which he described as his own creation with a resolution of 1280\u00d7960, perfect for desktop backgrounds.\n\nAdding an unexpected twist to the tale, none other than Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, chimed in on the forum to facilitate the trade. This revelation has only deepened the intrigue surrounding the transaction\u2019s true nature and purpose.\n\nDespite Sabunir\u2019s initial enthusiasm, his offer failed to garner substantial interest after a month had passed. On February 9, 2010, a forum user by the name of SmokeTooMuch bluntly expressed disinterest in spending money on the wallpaper, causing Sabunir to question the viability of future attempts.\n\nHowever, on February 24, 2010, Sabunir\u2019s Bitcoin wallet received not one, but two transactions: one for 100 BTC and another for the astonishing sum of 500 BTC.\n\nThis turn of events has ignited a lively debate within the community. Some argue that these transactions could signify the sale of the aforementioned JPEG, potentially predating the infamous Bitcoin transaction involving 10,000 BTC exchanged for two pizzas.\n\nNevertheless, dissenting voices suggest that these transactions might have been donations rather than purchases. Adding fuel to the fire, a Twitter user claims that the initial transaction of 100 BTC was received a mere seven minutes prior to the request for donations.\n\nAmidst the fervent discussion and speculation, it appears that only Sabunir holds the key to clarifying the nature of this widely debated Bitcoin transaction. Until then, the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits his input, hoping to unravel this intriguing mystery.\n\nIn other Bitcoin-related news, it is worth noting that over 6.8 million Bitcoin Ordinals Inscriptions have been minted to date, as reported by a Dune dashboard. This innovative technology allows for the inscription of various data formats, including text, audio, and video, onto Satoshis, the smallest unit of BTC. This groundbreaking approach adds a unique and personalized touch to individual Satoshis."

Despite a retreat from the significant psychological resistance at $30,000, Bitcoin continues to trade above two critical technical indicators on the weekly timeframe. Van de Poppe believes that the digital asset\u2019s upward momentum will persist, leading it towards the price range of $38,000 to $42,000.\n\n#Bitcoin breaks upwards and tests $27,600.\n\n\n\nGood signs.\n\n\n\nWeekly timeframe; Holding 200 MA and EMA.\n\n\n\nI think we're continuing towards $38,000-42,000 from here. pic.twitter.com/gduHkOFUHu \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 15, 2023\n\nAnother respected crypto analyst, Kaleo, who has a Twitter following of 587,400, shares the bullish sentiment. Kaleo suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s recent reclaiming of support around $27,000 sets the stage for a potential rally to fresh yearly highs.

Bluntz believes that Bitcoin\u2019s corrective move from $30,000 has likely concluded and anticipates a resumption of the cryptocurrency\u2019s upward trend. Noting the emergence of favorable follow-through candles on the daily chart, Bluntz suggests that new all-time highs may be within reach if the recent three-wave ABC correction is indeed complete.

        "content": "Bitcoin, an electronic cash system, is not just a currency or a new form of money, but also a technology platform, and until just the last few months, few people understood this. Recently, the Ordinals protocol on BTC has created a frenzy of digital tokens that have exploded in popularity and ignited a token bull run amid \u201ccrypto\u201d market stagnation and generally flat mainstream market price action of stocks and other traditional assets.\n\nBut did you know this isn\u2019t the first Bitcoin token boom? In fact, it\u2019s not even the first Bitcoin data era. That\u2019s right! We have been here before.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto kicked off the blockchain with the \u201carbitrary\u201d data of the Times headline to prove there was no pre-mine of the tokens. A perfect timestamp proof for the world to remember in perpetuity. But today, many advocates would call such a thing SPAM.\n\nIn breaking news, it is possible that the first known purchase using Bitcoin may have been a screensaver-sized JPEG procured through a discussion on the forums in participation with Satoshi Nakamoto himself. Adding credence to Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness as cash and the bizarre notion that digital art might be exponentially more valuable than a bitcoin itself. In this case, it appears someone valued this screensaver more than five hundred bitcoins!\n\nThis Twitter Space was FIRE We discovered that: \ud83d\udd25 the first purchase EVER with bitcoin was buying a JPEG for 500 BTC in Feb 2010 \ud83d\udd25 it pre-dates the the famous 10,000 BTC pizza \ud83d\udd25 satoshi himself helped facilitate the JPEG sale \ud83d\udd25 laser-eye cult in absolute SHAMBLES pic.twitter.com/b6ESOkbf0i \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) May 14, 2023\n\nYears later, as we enter a new cycle of debate about the value of bitcoin, electronic cash and tokens, it is important to remember that it has never ended well for token advocates, and Bitcoin seems to consistently lose ground to investment guru-type advocacy.\n\nMaybe this time, it\u2019s different.\n\nContext\n\nFew people know that Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology is just a distributed database, powerful script language, and a communications network that is combined to make scarce programmable money. The most common use of Bitcoin is simple payments using an unlocking script to send, but with a little more creativity in the use of the script stack, developers have successfully created tokens or unique digital assets that can represent anything from a piece of art, proof of purchase or something like real estate property.\n\nFewer people understand that this concept is nearly as old as Bitcoin itself!\n\nThe advent of colored coins and counterparty tokens, both forms of Bitcoin tokens, ignited significant disagreement within the Bitcoin community, leading to what is commonly referred to as the \u201cBitcoin Civil War.\u201d\n\nThe Genesis of Bitcoin tokens\n\nBitcoin tokens were conceived as far back as Satoshi himself discussing tokens in vending machines and adult sites, but at the time were just theoretical. In 2013, colored coins were conceived to implement sats in transactions beyond simple monetary transactions. Ordinals are based on this premise today.\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nThe idea was to embed extra information into Bitcoin transactions, turning them into \u201ctokens\u201d representing any form of value\u2014not just currency. This opened up a world of possibilities, from tokenized assets to decentralized applications.\n\nIntroduction of CounterParty tokens\n\nIn 2014-15, Counterparty tokens took the concept of Bitcoin tokens a step further. Colored coins could \u201ccolor\u201d a specific Bitcoin, marking it as representing a certain asset or contract. Counterparty tokens, on the other hand, allowed for creating custom tokens within the Bitcoin blockchain using added scripts in OP_Return which allowed for more complex applications and financial instruments.\n\nAt the time, the companies behind CounterParty were soliciting potential customers, including common playing card games and large retailers who were interested in issuing assets on Bitcoin.\n\nHere's a BTC wallet from 2014 with fungible #bitcoin tokens displayed. This is from back before the geniuses that control the BIP process nuked it and paved the way for the creation of 20,000 altcoins. There never needed to be an Ethereum or altcoin economy, folks\u2026 #coinprism pic.twitter.com/ClL2uFp6Sh \u2014 Kurt \u25c9 GorillaPool.com (@kurtwuckertjr) October 6, 2022\n\nThe Bitcoin Civil War: Causes and battles\n\nHowever, these new developments were not welcomed by all. Some small blocker purists argued that these tokens detracted from Bitcoin\u2019s sole purpose as a simple, decentralized currency. Others were concerned about the scalability and security implications of these tokens. These disagreements turned into a full-blown conflict, with debates, forks, and even personal attacks marking the 2015-16 era as the opening of the \u201cBitcoin Civil War.\u201d\n\nLuke Dashjr, a prominent Core developer of BTC, issued a \u201cpatch\u201d that reduced the size of OP_Return to 40kb\u2014killing CounterParty\u2019s use cases with a single software update across the network and showing the problems of centralization in the software issuance process of Bitcoin.\n\nThe fallout\n\nThe fallout from this conflict was significant. This era saw the opening of major schisms, and the community split into different factions, each supporting different technological and philosophical paths for Bitcoin. This included dividing social groups, brands \u201ctaking sides\u201d and ultimately led to a split of Bitcoin in 2017. Since then, the value and reputation of Bitcoin have suffered\u2014losing roughly half of its market dominance since 2017 as the dream of a unified, global Bitcoin currency has receded and been replaced with a pump-and-dump economy of mostly nonsense.\n\nThe resurgence\n\nIn the 2017-2022 era, big blockers (BCH, then later BSV) focused on research and development of token standards, scalability, and smart contracts that interact natively in the Bitcoin stack. This has included CounterParty style OP_Return tokens, Script-style tokens like STAS, and a smattering of hybrid systems that have shown themselves to be scalable up to a little less than three million token transactions per block\u2014a number inconceivable on any other blockchain.\n\nFound Fresh Bananas \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c Block: 733,689\n\nSize: 3.65 GB\n\nTx count: 2,512,670\n\nAverage fee: $0.00038\n\nTotal fees: 9.76 BSV\n\nTotal revenue: 16.01 BSV\n\nRevenue from fees: 60.96%https://t.co/tbY59NdZvf \u2014 BananaBlocks\u2122 by GorillaPool\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c (@banana_blocks) April 4, 2022\n\nOn the small blocker side, BTC has tightened the swimlanes of the network to reduce use cases and focus on limiting bandwidth to encourage node count to grow as a metric of \u201cdecentralization\u201d and \u201cstore of value.\u201d\n\nRecently, though, these old debates have been resurfacing after a BTC developer named Casey Rodarmor created a simple, elegant tokenization standard using a variation of the colored coin method to inscribe non-fungible assets atop satoshis. Since it uses an ordinal counting method of sats, the protocol is called \u201cOrdinals,\u201d and it has ignited a firestorm of controversy about transaction validity, SPAM, and other politically motivated drama. During the original civil war, massive amounts of money were poured into influencers, media, and social campaigns to teach people that Bitcoin wasn\u2019t capable of tokens or scalability. Ordinal inscriptions on BTC have severely undermined the authoritative claims by small blocker aristocrats like Luke Dashjr, who has been searching for a way to put an end to this tool on BTC again.\n\nNice of \u201cLuke Dash Jr\u201d to assume a fiduciary role over #BTC like this! pic.twitter.com/q1lczmcOTn \u2014 Kurt \u25c9 GorillaPool.com (@kurtwuckertjr) May 10, 2023\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to evolve and new applications for its technology are discovered, the same battles over its purpose and direction are being fought anew. This resurgence is fueled by the same passion and disagreements that marked the original Bitcoin Civil War. It has created an opportunity for newcomers to revisit the discussions that precipitated all of this. The BSV faction has recently released the 1Sat Ordinals protocol, which makes use of the basic Ordinal tokenization system, but allows truly single-sat transactions, micropayments, and sub-cent fees to empower entrepreneurs to focus on the value of their tokens rather than being forced to value them based on the cost of utilization.\n\nSimilar projects are popping up on Litecoin and Dogecoin because of their basic similarities as Bitcoin forks.\n\nLooking forward\n\nThe future of Bitcoin, and its tokens, remains uncertain. Will the community learn from its past and find a way to reconcile its differences, or is another civil war inevitable?\n\nWill BTC split into an ordinal chain and a non-ordinal chain? How will tickers and hash power shake out? Will this teach people that BTC transactions are not mutable, and have the developer aristocrats painted themselves into a narrative corner? Could the threat of removal push more energy and development onto other chains the same way BTC dominance has been in a nearly six-year decline in market dominance?\n\nWhatever the outcome, the journey of Bitcoin tokens from a novel idea to a contentious issue has been a fascinating reflection of the broader struggles within the Bitcoin community for the last ten years.\n\nCoinGeek Weekly Livestream: Ordinals on BSV!

        "title": "Analysts Believe InQubeta Will Create Millionaires While Bitcoin Cash And Near Protocol Leave Investors Disillusioned ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The crypto market is always on the lookout for innovative projects that could potentially disrupt existing industries. InQubeta (QUBE) is one such project that has gained a lot of attention recently.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a crypto crowdfunding platform that allows fractional investment in AI start-ups using $QUBE tokens. In this article, we\u2019ll explore what makes InQubeta unique and why it could be a good investment opportunity \u2013 as well as why competitors like Bitcoin Cash and Near Protocol might not be the smartest investments in the current climate.\n\n\n\nInQubeta\n\nRevolutionizing AI Start-up Funding\n\nInQubeta is the first platform to offer a revolutionary way for AI start-ups to raise funds and engage with their community. It allows investors to invest in a brand without over-leveraging themselves, while still gaining exposure to the potential upside. This is known as fractional investment, the concept that crypto is based on.\n\nThe $QUBE token is an ERC20 token that is designed to be deflationary, with the aim of creating a more transparent, secure, and democratic investment ecosystem for AI tech start-ups. Investors can benefit from staking their tokens as well as a buy / sell tax that goes directly into a burn wallet.\n\nInQubeta\u2019s NFT Marketplace\n\nOne unique feature of the InQubeta platform is its NFT marketplace, which enables AI start-ups to raise funds and offer rewards and equity-based NFTs. $QUBE token holders can easily invest in the projects they believe in, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem. This innovative approach to fundraising is a game-changer for AI start-ups.\n\nCompetitive Advantage\n\nInQubeta\u2019s competitors, such as Bitcion Cash and Near Protocol, seem to be facing a whole host of challenges in growing and gaining users. In contrast, InQubeta is gaining momentum and capitalizing on a massive new wave of AI start-ups that have begun to dominate a variety of markets. The global AI market is expected to reach half a trillion US dollars in 2023. InQubeta is well-positioned to become the new standard for investing in AI technology.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fClick Here To Buy InQubeta \u25aa\ufe0f\n\nWhat\u2019s Wrong With Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a crypto coin that emerged in 2017 as a fork of Bitcoin. It was created to address some of the scalability issues that Bitcoin faced, such as slow transaction times and high fees. However, despite its initial popularity, Bitcoin Cash has severely struggled to maintain its position in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this is the ongoing debate over its governance structure.\n\nBitcoin Cash has notoriously been plagued by disagreements among its developers and community members, leading to multiple forks and splits. This has created confusion and uncertainty for investors, making it difficult for them to understand the long-term potential of the currency as a whole.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin Cash has faced stiff competition from other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Litecoin, which have been more successful in attracting users and developers. This has led many investors to lose faith in Bitcoin Cash and seek alternative investment opportunities\n\nNear Protocol\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR) is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has struggled to gain traction in the market. Despite its promising technology and strong development team, NEAR has failed to deliver on its hype, leaving investors disillusioned with its recent performance.\n\nOne of the main challenges facing NEAR is the crowded nature of the crypto market. With thousands of coins and tokens competing for attention and investment, it can be difficult for new entrants like NEAR to stand out and gain a foothold.\n\nMoreover, NEAR has also faced criticism for its lack of decentralization and governance structure. Some investors have expressed concern that the project is too centralized, with too much power concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or organizations.\n\nOverall, both Bitcoin Cash and NEAR Protocol have faced significant challenges in the cryptocurrency market. While they both have promising technologies and strong development teams, they will need to address their governance and adoption issues if they hope to regain investor confidence in comparison to other more solid projects like InQubeta.\n\nFor more information on InQubeta visit the website | Join the presale | Become a part of the community for regular updates.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

This means that citizens can buy, sell, and hold BTC, but they are not allowed to buy anything with this currency. People are free to own BTC and any other cryptocurrency, deposit and trade with it on an Exchange and withdraw it to AED.\n\nCryptocurrencies have no underlying commodity or tangible asset. These coins fall outside financial regulation. If you lose money, the UAE does not offer any financial insurance. eToro, AVAtrade, IQ Option and Pepperstone provide crypto-insurance against theft, hacker attacks, and natural disasters, but not for volatile market movement.\n\nThe Regulation of Bitcoin in UAE\n\nCryptocurrencies in UAE fall under the authority of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Commodities Authority, and the Dubai Financial Services Agency. The SCA/FRSA oversees the trading of digital coins. The Central Bank in UAE considers crypto trading as highly risky, which is why all parties involved in the transaction must follow strict compliance to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Laws of the UAE.\n\nCurrently there is no unified regulation on cryptocurrencies in UAE and trading with virtual assets like Bitcoin still remains Illegal. Following the latest statement of The Central Bank of the UAE saying that crypto or virtual assets are not presently accepted or acknowledged as legal tender in the UAE, the only valid currency in this country recognised by the central bank remains the UAE dirham.\n\nWhile the legality of virtual currencies is still vague, cryptocurrency exchanges like BitOasis have been licensed to operate in the global crypto market. As of now UAE citizens are allowed to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as investments, but they are not able to buy any physical goods with them.\n\nWhy Should You Buy Bitcoin in UAE?\n\nThe UAE aim to become a global hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology as market capitalization hits $1.4 trillion, up 86 percent year to date. UAE regulators are adopting new legal frameworks and regulations that makes the country open to new crypto and blockchain startups. All of this shows a great opportunity for investors to buy Bitcoin in United Arab Emirates. The following sections will explain this into more details.\n\nPost Covid Inflation\n\nThe world wide inflation rates are going through the roof as a consequence of post Covid stimulation packages implemented by governments and central banks around the world in 2020 and 2021.
