        "content": "Crypto became far less damaging to the environment in 2022 after Ethereum, the second biggest blockchain, lowered its carbon emissions by 99%. That puts a bigger spotlight on bitcoin, which is estimated to have emitted 86.3 million tons of carbon in 2022.\n\nNuclear power may be able to help. Cumulus Data has completed a data center connected to Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power station, with plans to this year begin hosting the space for Bitcoin mining company TeraWulf. The center's completion, which was announced last week by Cumulus Data, sets it up to be the first nuclear-powered bitcoin mine in the US.\n\nIt means that any bitcoin mined through the center will emit next to no carbon.\n\nMining bitcoin requires enormous amounts of energy. Computers around the world race to solve complicated cryptographic puzzles, with the first to do so being rewarded with new bitcoin. The more computational power at your disposal, the greater your odds of solving the problem first. To be competitive, bitcoin miners setup warehouses filled with computer rigs dedicated to the process, guzzling vast sums of electricity.\n\nBecause renewable energy sources tend to be cheaper, bitcoin miners often setup their operation close to solar, wind or hydro farms. It's estimated that over 55% of bitcoin is mined using renewable energy, a point crypto proponents often make to argue that bitcoin is in fact good for the environment due to its encouragement of renewable energy. But bitcoin's emissions remain gargantuan, and nuclear energy is increasingly being seen as a way to reduce it.\n\nCumulus Data's arrangement is one of many. Oklo is an energy startup that plans to build a small nuclear plant; it's signed a 20-year deal with bitcoin-mining firm Compass Mining. Miami's pro-crypto mayor has tried to attract bitcoin miners from China by offering up the city's ample nuclear power.\n\nThe system by which bitcoin is mined, via computers competing to solve a puzzle, is called \"proof of work.\" Its purpose is to make bitcoin unhackable: You'd need to control over 51% of the computational power in bitcoin's network to overwhelm the system. Last year, Ethereum switched from proof of work to a system called \"proof of stake\" in which people deposit ether into the network for a chance to be chosen to \"verify\" transactions, for which they're rewarded with ether tokens.\n\nIn essence, proof of work has people expending electricity in order to earn bitcoin, proof of stake has people deposit money in the system. As a result of the switch, Ethereum's carbon footprint has shrunk by over 99%. There is no significant proposal for bitcoin to make the same switch."

        "content": "A new nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania will host bitcoin mining.\n\nThis is the first nuclear-powered bitcoin mine in the United States.\n\nBitcoin mining is a historically pollution-filled industry, but it\u2019s beginning to focus on cleaner energy to run energy-hungry computers.\n\nComputers eat up a lot of energy, and so do the blockchains required to constantly mine cryptocurrency. But a new nuclear-powered data center is set to launch in Pennsylvania later this year, and it could shift at least some of that pollution-filled energy consumption to a cleaner version.\n\nCumulus Data has wrapped the first phase of its 475-megawatt, zero-carbon Susquehanna data center campus in northeast Pennsylvania. The project starts with a 48-megawatt, 300,000-square-foot data center to power TeraWulf, a bitcoin mining company.\n\nThe 1,200-acre campus aims to provide zero-carbon energy from Talen Energy\u2019s Susquehanna nuclear power generation facility. The Cumulus data centers will connect directly to the facility without legacy electric transmission and distribution utilities. The data centers employing direct-connect, on-site nuclear power generation will make it the first nuclear-powered bitcoin mine in the U.S.\n\nRelated Story Bitcoin Uses More Electricity Than Argentina\n\nTo mine additional bitcoin, computers must continually operate to solve complex puzzles. This process is a power-sucking endeavor that has led to massive data centers across the world dedicated just to bitcoin mining. These data centers crave energy. Ethereum, the world\u2019s second largest crypto blockchain, has already started improving its carbon emission efforts, but bitcoin accounts for roughly 70 percent of all crypto electricity usage and hasn\u2019t made major gains in cleaning up its process.\n\nElectricity usage from global crypto mining quadrupled from 2018 to 2022, according to the U.S. government. By mid-2022, crypto assets were using upward of 240 billion kilowatt hours per year\u2014more than the annual electricity of countries such as Argentina or Australia. Crypto electricity usage made up nearly 1 percent of all annual global electricity usage, and crypto operations consume up to 1.7 percent of all U.S. electricity usage.\n\nAs data centers across the world look to move cryptocurrency mining toward renewable energy, switching to nuclear may serve as one way to clean up the industry."

        "title": "Can bitcoin be used for cross-border payments? - Kraken Blog",
        "content": "In 2008, an anonymous researcher (or team of researchers) called Satoshi Nakamoto published a nine-page research paper entitled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d The document, known as the Bitcoin white paper, presented a new type of digital currency that users could use to transact without relying on financial intermediaries.\n\nSoon, people around the world discovered that blockchain transactions, specifically cross-border transactions, were faster than most international bank transfers. The blockchain could settle a bitcoin transaction in just a few minutes as compared to the 2-3 business days needed by traditional services. By removing banks from the process, Bitcoin mitigated the high costs often associated with cross-border payments.\n\nHow bitcoin payments work\n\nBitcoin network and blockchain\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the protocol\u2019s native digital currency, circumvents the banking system by relying on a series of interconnected \u201cnodes.\u201d\n\nVolunteer users operate these nodes on the Bitcoin network and help maintain it by using their computers to perform various tasks. These machines are connected to the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 a special type of ledger system used to verify and record transaction data.\n\nYou can think of these two concepts \u2013 the Bitcoin network and blockchain \u2013 as a globally distributed group of people all working together on an open Google Document. Whenever new information is added to the document, everyone else has to first make sure there are no errors in it. The document is also totally accessible to anyone who wishes to view it \u2013 not just those working on it.\n\nIn exchange for fulfilling energy-intensive roles like data validation, nodes can earn rewards paid in newly minted bitcoin.\n\nHow a transaction works\n\nWhen a person wishes to send a bitcoin transaction to someone, they first have to broadcast it to the rest of the network. Nodes then independently check the validity of the transaction and compete to win the right to add that and a batch of other transactions into a new block on the blockchain.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain, you can check out our Learn Center guide What is bitcoin mining?\n\nOnce we add a transaction to the blockchain, it\u2019s finalized. Because there are no intermediaries involved, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the recipient is in the same country or on the other side of the world. In theory, all transactions take the same amount of time to process. You can think of it as sending an email versus a hand-written letter.\n\nThese properties are why cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are ideal for frictionless remittances and cross-border transfers.\n\nBarriers to bitcoin payments adoption\n\nThere are several advantages to using bitcoin over traditional currencies. A 2021 survey found that only 13% of U.S. customers preferred to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when sending overseas payments. This low level of preference occurs despite figures showing that 42% of surveyed people paid an average fee of 6.2% when sending traditional remittance payments.\n\nSo what\u2019s holding people back? It is possible people are put off by several misconceptions surrounding bitcoin payments.\n\nPrivacy\n\nBitcoin transactions aren\u2019t usually anonymous. When you use an exchange to transfer cryptocurrency, you must submit something called Know Your Customer (KYC) data. This data often includes your personal information and a copy of your passport. KYC is important because it makes sure that transactions are legal and regulated.\n\nIllicit activities\n\nFor many years, criminals have abused the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin payments to fund nefarious activities. While it\u2019s impossible to know exactly what percentage of payments are involved in illegal ventures, advancements in detection, tracking, and enforcement have made fraud far less attractive.\n\nA recent report by Chainalysis estimated that crooks used around $10 billion, or 0.34% of all bitcoin transactions, to fund criminal enterprises.\n\nIn comparison, United Nations figures found up to 5% of global GDP is involved in money laundering and other criminal practices per year. This equates to around two trillion U.S. dollars.\n\nHigh energy consumption\n\nIt\u2019s no mystery that the computational power committed to securing the bitcoin network \u2014 around ~100 TW/h \u2014 is extremely high. However, it\u2019s important to note that this figure represents the energy consumption of a complete financial system, including issuance and transaction settlement.\n\nIn fact, nobody has tried to measure how much energy a major currency consumes per hour. Think about the U.S. dollar and how many banks, money printers, ATMs, card payment devices, and security vehicles are needed to support just one currency. Now think about how much energy those combined items consume \u2013 potentially a lot more than the Bitcoin network!\n\nVolatility\n\nBitcoin is renowned for being a particularly volatile asset class. This volatility means its price can fluctuate dramatically within a short time.\n\nFor remittance payments, the volatility may lead to the recipient receiving less than the intended fiat-denominated amount once the transaction is completed. However, this volatility works both ways and sometimes during bullish market movements, recipients can receive a higher amount.\n\nThe sender can also mitigate the effects of bitcoin volatility and transaction speeds simply by taking a few precautions. These involve trading during weekends when network congestion is low and avoiding sending remittance payments during particularly bearish episodes.\n\nOverall, while some people may not want to use bitcoin for cross-border payments, it boasts several key advantages over traditional currency. These are speed, cost, and transaction finality. Keep in mind that after bitcoin has been sent across borders, it can quickly and easily be converted back to a government currency using a crypto exchange like Kraken.\n\nNeed help understanding how to use Kraken to manage your assets?

        "title": "Bitcoin: Will This Rally Last? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The price of bitcoin (BTC) has had a healthy increase this month, climbing by about forty percent since the beginning of the month. But that leaves open questions about the durability of this rise and whether or not the price of bitcoin will continue to surge from this point forward.\n\nBitcoin's Price\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has not yet recovered from its precipitous drop after reaching an all-time high of $68,904 in November 2021. The crash in cryptocurrency values was brought about by a variety of factors, including the ultra hawkish-monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and the big failures of cryptocurrency fraud schemes like Celsius. Nevertheless, the BTC price has staged a respectable rebound this month, rising dramatically from last month's low of $16,263 to this month's high of $23,324.\n\nWhy Has There Been Such a Big Jump in Price?\n\nIt is imperative that I first discuss the fundamentals that are the driving force for the present rally before I begin to discuss the resilience of the current rally. The Fed's aggressive monetary policy was the primary factor in the precipitous drop in the price of bitcoin. The Federal Reserve has since shifted its position on monetary policy, going from one that was very hawkish to one that is less aggressive. For instance, it is a near certainty that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by just 25 basis points next month. This indicates that the Fed has altered its view despite on inflation as it comes off its peak.\n\nThe risk-on rally is another factor that has contributed to the price of bitcoin being relatively stable. Bitcoin's price has formed a significant positive correlation with the S&P 500 index, which indicates that as the index goes up, we also see an increase in the price of BTC. This suggests that Bitcoin's value will continue to rise in the future as long as the risk-on rally continues.\n\nIn addition, there is a widespread view among traders and investors that Bitcoin has prevailed despite disastrous events such as the collapse of FTX and the domino effect that it triggered as a result. Hodlers have begun to ponder the possibility that crypto winter is over and that we are going to emerge from this predicament unscathed.\n\nWill the Price of Bitcoin Continue to Climb?\n\nThere are two critical aspects of this situation that need close attention. First, there is an influx of money that is being invested for speculative purposes. Everyone is aware that cryptocurrencies have taken a significant hit in prices, and if Bitcoin starts to rise, then there is a strong possibility that other cryptocurrencies will also start to rally. It is quite probable that if the price of bitcoin continues to spike, it will induce more FOMO, which implies that more speculative money will flow into the cryptocurrency industry. This has the potential to drive up the price of BTC.\n\nSecondly, the dollar could weaken if the Fed does start to slow down the process of raising interest rates, as is expected. This has the potential to have two different effects on the price of bitcoin. One is a possibility that the risk-on rally could gain additional momentum, which would be beneficial for bitcoin. The other is that the decline in the value of the dollar index might also lead to an increase in the price of bitcoin.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, there is no doubt that the price of BTC is overbought, as shown by the RSI on a daily time frame. Any reading that is either close to or over 70 suggests that a retracement in prices is probable, while any value that is either close to or below 30 indicates that the price of the asset has been grossly oversold.\n\nTo technical analysts, the $30,000 level is the most significant point of resistance for the price of bitcoin. If the price does not break above this level of resistance, then the bull rally will be in jeopardy. But if BTC breaks through this level and maintains its position above this price point, the likelihood that the price action of BTC will once again attempt to re-test its all-time high will significantly increase.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarize, the price of bitcoin has recently begun to attract more attention, but we are not yet out of the woods, and won't be until the price breaks through the $30,000 resistance level and then continues its ascent from that point forward.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Partnering with the Sierra Club, Finger Lakes activists opposed to the continued operation of a Seneca Lake power plant repurposed for bitcoin mining are asking the Environmental Protection Agency to shut the Seneca Lake plant down.\n\nA lawsuit filed in the federal Western District of New York\u2019s Rochester Division Tuesday by the Seneca Lake Guardian, the Committee to Preserve the Finger Lakes and the Sierra Club comes as bitcoin miner Greenidge Generation may be weighing a bankruptcy filing.\n\nGreenidge stated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last month that though it had restructured some $74 million in debt, it still saw bankruptcy as a possibility.\n\n\u201cThere remains uncertainty regarding Greenidge\u2019s financial condition and substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d the filing states.\n\nThe lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club and Finger Lakes activists claims that Greenidge\u2019s bitcoin mining operation, situated in the Yates County village of Dresden, runs afoul of Clean Water Act rules and other federal environmental regulations. The court action comes after months of fencing between Greenidge, environmentalists trying to shutter the firm\u2019s Seneca Lake plant and the state Department of Environmental Conservation.\n\nGreenidge Generation\u2019s president blasted the lawsuit, and the groups that filed it.\n\n\u201cHow many times are we going to do this same exact thing? You could have set your watch to the interest groups filing another frivolous legal challenge that in the end is just a PR stunt,\u201d said Dale Irwin, responding to the Beacon\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost every single lawsuit they\u2019ve filed over eight years\u2014with five court rulings against them, and zero for them. The result here will follow the same pattern\u2014file a lawsuit, get some media attention and then later lose in court because you have no grounds.\u201d\n\nAt issue is a formerly coal-fired power plant retrofitted in 2017 to run on natural gas. Since 2019, Greenidge has operated a bitcoin mining operation at the plant, which also provides electricity to the local energy grid as part of the facility\u2019s public licensing agreement with the state\u2019s power grid operator, NYSIO.\n\nSo-called proof-of-work mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is done by banks of powerful computers that run trillions of computations to solve highly complicated problems that when successfully solved unlock blocks that yield cryptocurrency \u201ccoins.\u201d\n\nWhile they have mostly failed to attain their purpose of serving as a medium of exchange not tied to any government, crypto coins are traded as commodities.\n\nAt its peak in 2021, a single bitcoin traded for more than $67,000. As of Jan. 1, 2022, the price had fallen to approximately $47,000. Midweek, bitcoins were trading around $22,500 apiece.\n\nIn materials submitted to the state, Greendige has portrayed itself as an economic development engine that would bring lots of jobs to the Finger Lakes region. Critics say the plant\u2019s operations pollute the air, generate greenhouse gases and discharge harmfully warm water into Seneca Lake, upsetting the 600-foot-deep glacially created Finger Lake\u2019s ecological balance.\n\nIn a 2021 Rochester Beacon opinion piece, commentator Michael Warren Thomas described the Seneca Lake plant as operating \u201cwithin a loophole in New York\u2019s environmental regulation the size of a power plant.\u201d\n\nOpponents say the Greenidge plant violates numerous environmental standards. Greenidge maintains the environmental impact of its plant\u2019s operations are minimal.\n\nIn June, the DEC turned down Greenidge\u2019s application to renew its Title V Air Permit. Greenidge criticized the agency\u2019s ruling, but said it decision would not affect the plant\u2019s operations because the application was deemed timely and complete, allowing its operations to continue running uninterrupted under its existing Title V permit, \u201cwhich is still in effect, for as long as it takes to successfully challenge this arbitrary and capricious decision.\u201d\n\nGreenidge\u2019s permit to discharge pollutants into Seneca Lake expired in September 2022 and has not been renewed, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe bitcoin mining firm \u201cfailed to submit to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation a sufficient renewal application containing complete, federally required information necessary for a renewal (therefore) the facility is not entitled to continue to discharge under its expired permit,\u201d the court brief argues.\n\nYvonne Hennessey of Barclay Damon, counsel for Greenidge, rejected that argument. \u201cDEC correctly concluded that Greenidge\u2019s renewal application was timely and sufficient. The mere fact that opponents disagree is beside the point. Indeed, opponents attack Greenidge and assert that the company has done something wrong when in reality they are asking a federal judge to second guess the DEC in matters within its sound discretion.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreenidge is clearly afraid after losing their air permit earlier this year, thanks to the work of Seneca Lake Guardian, Earthjustice, and thousands of supporters in the Finger Lakes and across the state, and now they\u2019re resorting to bullying\u201d said Yvonne Taylor, vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian. \u201cBy the way, Greenidge is challenging the DEC\u2019s air permit decision\u2014so we\u2019re not the only ones asking a judge to second guess the DEC in matters within its sound discretion.\u201d\n\nIrwin countered that Greenidge last week \u201ccompleted a $6 million advanced fish screen system, meeting all state and federal requirements, to protect aquatic life in Seneca Lake. Efforts like this from opponents is why nobody in the Finger Lakes listened to these gadflies anymore; they have zero credibility. We continue to operate under a valid permit, and the latest phony complaint from these perennial litigation losers can\u2019t change that.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t file lawsuits,\u201d he added, \u201cthey issue press releases dressed up as lawsuits and simply waste the courts, and taxpayers, time and money.\u201d\n\nResponded Jill Heaps, senior attorney for Earthjustice, counsel for the environmentalists: \u201cEarthjustice is a national nonprofit environmental law firm, and we stand by our legal filing. We do not litigate our claims in the press, but we look forward to addressing their defenses in federal district court.\u201d\n\nUpdated and corrected 1/26/23.\n\nWill Astor is Rochester Beacon senior writer.

        "title": "Crypto miners seek financial lifeline with intense battle for bitcoins - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nCryptocurrency miners are turning their machines back on as the rallying price of bitcoin offers a vital lifeline to their cash-strapped businesses.\n\nThe value of the token has emerged from the doldrums to soar by more than a quarter this year against the dollar, incentivising the owners of huge warehouses of servers for mining to accelerate their use in the battle to secure more bitcoins.\n\nThe average hashrate, or the computing power directed towards mining bitcoin, rose to a record 280 exahash \u2014 or quintillion \u2014 operations per second on January 20, according to data from Hashrate Index, a mining information service.\n\nThe upsurge in activity is a sign that the battered sector may be crawling back to life after being buffeted by high energy costs and the slumping price of the cryptocurrency. The activity level has more than doubled from a low point in July, when the crypto market was hit by a credit crisis.\n\nMiners race each other to solve cryptographic puzzles that validate batches of transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain, a ledger of deals. That makes them the guarantors that bitcoin deals are trustworthy in a system that bypasses third parties such as banks and exchanges. The winner is rewarded with new coins.\n\nMany are sat on large quantities of mining equipment and capacity, bought with cheap money in 2021 and early 2022 in anticipation of turning a profit from the rising price of coins. But bitcoin prices slumped 65 per cent last year and energy prices soared, forcing many companies to switch off servers to save money. Others, such as Core Scientific, could not withstand the pressure and filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThe sentiment among miners is better than in a long time,\u201d said Jaran Mellerud, an analyst at Hashrate Index. \u201cFor many bankruptcy threatened players, the sudden increase in the bitcoin price is a lifeline.\u201d\n\nThe rebound has underpinned investor optimism in listed companies like Marathon Digital Holdings, which has soared 155 per cent this year, and Hut 8, which has climbed 134 per cent.\n\nBut miners still face a long haul back from the brink. Turning on their servers is expensive. An algorithm adjusts the \u201cdifficulty level\u201d of mining bitcoin when new computers enter or exit the network, to ensure that the token is mined at its regular interval of roughly every 10 minutes.\n\nThe influx of miners has raised that level. It now takes miners a record 37tn hashes or guesses before verifying a block, according to BTC.com, so the losers expend ever-larger quantities of energy for nothing.\n\nThey are also facing a squeeze from politicians around the world, who see the miners\u2019 computers sucking up large amounts of power, draining local resources or damaging the environment. Others see the profits they make as a taxable asset.\n\nThe Canadian provinces British Columbia and Manitoba have barred new connections to their grids for 18 months, while Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, Quebec\u2019s public utility provider, has filed a request to reallocate 270 megawatts of power it had set aside for the mining industry.\n\nIn December, the lower house of Kazakhstan, host of the world\u2019s third largest share of mining activity, approved a bill that will impose a corporate tax on miners and curtail their energy usage.\n\n\n\nParaguay, which has an abundance of cheap hydroelectric power, rejected legislation that would have capped the tariffs imposed on miners to 15 per cent.\n\n\u201cMiners are becoming very selective about where they build out their infrastructure,\u201d said Joe Burnett, an analyst at mining advisory firm Blockware Solutions. \u201cA few years ago people were really just focused on cheap power but now it\u2019s become a lot more critical to look at which political jurisdiction is more favourable and isn\u2019t going to shut down our operations.\u201d\n\nMiners say they have become an unfair target. The Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry group, estimated in July that just under 60 per cent of global mining energy use was sustainable, although the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance puts the figure at about 37 per cent.\n\n\u201cThere is a fake environmental argument being waged against the mining industry,\u201d said Samir Tabar, chief strategist at Bit Digital, a mining company with operations in New York, Texas, Nebraska and Georgia. \u201cIt seems that no matter what bitcoin miners do, even if we use 100 per cent renewables, nothing is OK.\u201d\n\nErcot, the organisation that operates Texas\u2019s power grid, will launch a voluntary curtailment programme for large energy consumers like bitcoin miners to reduce their power use during high demand periods, until it develops a permanent regime to deal with shortages.\n\nBut that pinch point may provide an unexpected opportunity. Miners with power purchase agreements, which lock in the price they pay for energy, are able to sell power back to the grid. Riot and Hive Blockchain have earned $4.9mn and $3.1mn respectively in December.\n\n\u201cCurtailment is the future of mining,\u201d said Burnett. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t make financial sense to mine, you might as well sell [energy] back to somebody.\u201d"

        "content": "The last year has been unkind to bitcoin, with its price dropping nearly 60% from its peak. That's dampened a lot of the hype around bitcoin, but not all of it. There are still many believers in the cryptocurrency's future, with Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers among them.\n\nRogers, a pro-Donald Trump Republican elected to Arizona's senate in 2020, on Tuesday submitted a bill that would make bitcoin legal tender in the state. Following in the footsteps of El Salvador, whose polarizing president made bitcoin legal tender in 2021, the bill, if passed, would afford bitcoin the same legal status as the US dollar. It could be used to pay debts, taxes and as a commercial medium of exchange.\n\nThe bills are co-sponsored by Rogers' state senate Repubican colleagues Jeff Weninger and J.D. Mesnard. Barring support from state Democrats, the bills could pass with uniform backing from the state's Republican senators and representatives. Republicans hold 16 of Arizona's 30 state senate seats and 31 of its 60 House of Representative spots.\n\nA similar bill introduced by Rogers in 2022 was quickly shot down, however. Rogers has also proposed allowing voters in 2024 decide whether cryptocurrency should be tax exempt in the state.\n\n\"Centralized digital money controlled by the central bankers is slavery,\" Rogers tweeted in April, hearkening back to bitcoin's Libertarian roots. \"Decentralized Bitcoin is freedom.\"\n\nMost famous for its adoption of bitcoin as legal tender is El Salvador. Led by President Nayib Bukele, the country has spent an estimated $107 million buying bitcoin, with those holdings now worth about half that amount. The beleaguered country's government spent another estimated $268 million setting up digital infrastructure for bitcoin, including a $30 incentive for everyone who signed up for its official bitcoin wallet, Chivo.\n\nCritics say the adoption of bitcoin was a cost that the heavily indebted country couldn't afford. Proponents say bitcoin is a more efficient means for remittances and that the country's sharp post-COVID tourism recovery can be chalked up at least partially to crypto tourism.\n\nArizona isn't alone in grappling with the regulation of cryptocurrency. Last week, lawmakers in Missouri and Mississippi sought to craft law protecting citizens' rights to mine bitcoin, an electricity-guzzling process that was banned in New York last year."

Erik Hersman, CEO and co-founder of Gridless, told Cointelegraph that while it\u2019s a brand new mining project, the \u201cimpact was immediately felt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe power developer had built these powerhouses a few years ago, but they weren\u2019t able to expand to more families because they\u2019re barely profitable and couldn\u2019t afford to buy more meters to connect more families.

Late last year, a mining project in Kenya connected a remote community using excess hydropower.\n\nStreet sellers in Malawi.

Hersman explained that electricity load shedding is common in Malawi, but the 1,600 families using the hydropower source do not have any power issues:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always amazing to me to see how useful and valuable mini-grids are to the community. It [Bitcoin mining] immediately changes the education, healthcare, business, logistics and wealth of the community where they go in.\u201d\n\nObi Nwosu, CEO of Fedimint and a board adviser at Gridless, also shed light on the story, explaining that the project in \u201cMalawi is one more in a line of what I expect to be many examples over the coming years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs usual, these are modest people rolling up their sleeves and helping talented, local engineers do what they do best. The project brings power as well as financial and economic freedom to many.\u201d\n\nBitcoin miners tapping into stranded energy while empowering local communities is a growing trend in 2023. From El Salvador\u2019s promise of geothermal Bitcoin mining to balancing the grid load and sustaining jobs for local communities in Canada, there is a \u201ctorrent of opportunities coming their way,\u201d Nwosu explains.\n\nRelated: Seven times Bitcoin miners made the world a better place\n\nMichael Saylor has described Bitcoin mining as \u201cthe ideal high-tech industry to put in a nation that has plenty of clean energy but isn\u2019t able to export a product or produce a service with that energy.\u201d It\u2019s an accurate summation of the project in Malawi.\n\nA canal channeling water in Malawi.

        "content": "If the first few weeks of 2023 are a harbinger of what\u2019s to come for cryptocurrency investors, then they may have reason to be brimming with optimism. The broad crypto market is rallying behind recovering bitcoin prices as the leading crypto pushes above $23,000.\n\nThe broad crypto market in 2022 suffered like the rest of the markets, namely stocks and bonds, following both asset classes in a downtrend amid inflation fears. That, of course, challenged cryptocurrencies as a viable asset that was uncorrelated to the traditional financial markets.\n\nBitcoin recently pushed above $23,000 after falling below $16,000 in 2022 on the expectation that the Fed will slow down the pace of its rate hikes as 2023 unfolds. With that, the correlation with stocks and bonds is occurring once again as both asset classes push higher along with bitcoin\u2019s price as well as the broad crypto market.\n\n\u201cFed tightening seems to be lighter and inflation less of a risk,\u201d Charles Hayter, CEO of crypto data site CryptoCompare, said in a CNBC report. \u201cThere is hope there will be more caution to rate rises globally.\u201d\n\nFTX Collapse Already Priced In?\n\nLast year\u2019s collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX could have put the proverbial nail in the coffin for cryptocurrency weakness in 2022. The recent collapse of the lending arm of New York-based crypto investment firm Genesis, which sought bankruptcy protection, should have added further weakness, but it appears it may have already been priced in.\n\nEither that, or the broad market bullishness momentum is so strong that investors are simply sloughing off this latest collapse. Either way, the Genesis bankruptcy isn\u2019t putting a dent in investor confidence just yet.\n\n\u201cThe Genesis debacle has been playing out for a while and is likely priced in already. FTX, on the other hand, has already had a significant impact on many investors, on market psychology and on the prices of several toxic assets,\u201d said Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of crypto investment advisory firm Quantum Economics, in a CNBC report.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted however that the price on bitcoin itself is quite limited since FTX didn\u2019t have any on their balance sheets,\u201d Greenspan added.\n\nThat said, bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are still subject to volatile movements in the market, so new investors looking at digital assets in 2023 should take caution still. Earnings forthcoming in big tech could confirm crypto\u2019s movements with the broader stock market and see heavy price fluctuations.\n\n\u201cBitcoin could test its August high and be supported at the $20k~$21k level, but with its RSI\u2019s divergence and a couple of big tech earnings ahead this week, it could get quite unstable,\u201d said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "While 2022 was a down year for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC 2.04%), the most valuable asset in the industry, losing 65%, things are taking a positive turn in 2023. As of Jan. 21, Bitcoin is up 36% so far on the year, and bullish supporters are hoping this is a microcosm of what's in store over the next 12 months.\n\nIt's really anyone's guess where Bitcoin's price goes next. But an exciting feature could carry this top cryptocurrency to new heights in 2023. Let's take a closer look.\n\nBuilding for speed and scalability\n\nSince its first verified transaction in January 2009 until now, Bitcoin has primarily only been used as a store of value. Bitcoin's defining characteristic, which is that there will only ever be 21 million coins created, makes many believe that as demand to own it increases over time, the fixed supply translates to a higher price. The comparison you've most likely heard is that Bitcoin is like a digital version of gold, a novel way to store wealth in a world that is only becoming more digital.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin was created with decentralization and security as non-negotiable traits. Not only are there thousands of miners across the world that help verify new transactions on the blockchain, but Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism makes it almost impossible for the network to be attacked. This is a great setup to have.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin's lack of scalability is an issue, as it can only process 3.5 transactions per second, according to bitinfocharts.com. In order for Bitcoin to evolve from a store of value to a medium of exchange, it needs to become faster at settling transactions.\n\nLuckily, a layer 2 solution, known as the lightning network, is in the works. The lightning network is built on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain, and it essentially creates channels between different parties who want to transact frequently with each other. For example, I might open a channel with my local coffee shop or gym. Any time I buy a cup of coffee or pay my monthly membership fee, balances are updated on the lightning network. These channels can be closed at any time, at which point the transaction is sent to the Bitcoin layer for final settlement.\n\nThe benefit of lightning is that it reduces the data load on the primary Bitcoin blockchain, as transactions are settled far less frequently. Lightning solves the problem of speed, scalability, and costs.\n\nA major fintech company like Block has already enabled free payments for its 49 million monthly Cash App users by connecting with the lightning network. Any additional news about the ongoing development and adoption of the lightning network should be closely followed in 2023, as this key feature's progress could catapult Bitcoin's price in short order.\n\nMacro factors matter\n\nBitcoin's price has skyrocketed quickly before. It was up 1,300% in 2017, 85% in 2019, 309% in 2020, and 1,120% in 2021, so it's not completely out of the question for it to go parabolic in 2023. With Bitcoin's price rising rapidly so far this year, \"hodlers\" are certainly hoping for the momentum to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, it's hard to overstate how important macroeconomic factors are to the price action of risky assets, a category where Bitcoin firmly belongs. The Federal Reserve started adopting a policy of monetary tightening in March last year, actions taken to curb soaring inflation that took hold of the economy. Immediately, we saw growth tech stocks, as well as cryptocurrencies, plummet.\n\nI'm always skeptical of any explanations that so-called financial experts provide as to why a particular asset moved up or down in a short period of time. But I think Bitcoin's rally to start the year has something to do with inflation cooling down in recent months. And this has many hoping that the Fed will pause its rate hikes, or maybe even reverse course, sometime in 2023.\n\nAn accommodative central bank, a growing economy, and positive investor sentiment are critical ingredients for Bitcoin to continue its climb throughout the year. While progress with the lightning network is definitely something to keep an eye on, at least for now, Bitcoin's price is fully dependent on investor enthusiasm in the near term."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) still risks \u201cconsiderable danger\u201d in 2023 as macroeconomic conditions dictate price action.\n\nThat is according to economist Lyn Alden, who, in private comments to Cointelegraph, cautioned on Bitcoin staying bullish after its January gains.\n\nAlden: BTC price bottom is a \u201cprocess\u201d\n\nOptimism is increasing throughout crypto as BTC/USD broadly retains levels, which are 40% higher than at the start of the year.\n\nWhat the rest of 2023 may hold, however, is still a topic of debate, and Alden suggests that it is naive to assume that the good times will continue unchecked.\n\nThe reason, she says, lies with the United States lawmakers and the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cI expect the BTC bottom to be a process,\u201d she summarized about the current state of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBTC prices are heavily tied to liquidity conditions, and liquidity conditions have been improving since Q4 2022.\u201d\n\nThat recovery has effectively removed any trace of the FTX debacle from the chart, with BTC/USD now circling its highest levels since mid-August.\n\n\u201cThe FTX\u2013Alameda collapse pulled down the industry in the second half of Q4 even as many other assets rallied \u2014 equities, gold, etc. \u2014 and now it seems that BTC is playing a bit of catch-up and getting back to where it would have been without the FTX\u2013Alameda collapse occurring,\u201d Alden continued.\n\nBTC/USD traded at around $22,600 at the time of writing, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart (Bitstamp). Source: TradingView\n\n\u201cConsiderable danger ahead\u201d\n\nWhat could lie beyond that \u201ccatch-up,\u201d however, could be less savory for bulls.\n\nRelated: BTC metrics exit capitulation \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nThe Fed is currently conducting quantitative tightening (QT), removing liquidity from the economy to fight inflation after several years of mass liquidity injections, which began in March 2020.\n\nThese are being mitigated thanks to U.S. domestic politics, but later on, the status quo could shift back to the kind of restrictive mood seen throughout Bitcoin\u2019s bear market year of 2022.\n\n\u201cThere is considerable danger ahead of for the second half of 2023,\u201d Alden explained.\n\n\u201cLiquidity conditions are good right now in part because the U.S. Treasury is drawing down its cash balance to avoid going over the debt ceiling, and this pushes liquidity into the financial system. So, the Treasury has been offsetting some of the QT that the Federal Reserve is doing. Once the debt ceiling issue gets resolved, the Treasury will be refilling its cash account, which pulls liquidity out of the system. At that point, both the Treasury and Fed will be sucking liquidity out of the system, and that would create a vulnerable time for risk assets in general, including BTC.\u201d\n\nIf H2 proves to be Bitcoin\u2019s reckoning, it will tie in with other warnings from market commentators regarding 2023.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of exchange BitMEX, has a much grimmer forecast for the year, likewise courtesy of Fed policy.\n\nIn the long term, however, Alden is confident that Bitcoin will recover from its recent lows for good.\n\n\u201cI do think this is a deep value accumulation zone for BTC with a three-to-five year view, but traders should be aware of the liquidity risks in the second half of this year,\u201d she concluded.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has an important new price target for bulls to meet \u2014 and it is closer than it seems.\n\nAs noted by Philip Swift, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, $25,000 is now a critical BTC price level.\n\nBitcoin price rally near \"a lot of liquidity\"\n\nAfter putting in 40% gains in January, Bitcoin continues to consolidate around the $23,000.\n\nOpinions are split as to what will happen next \u2014 after more than a year of bear market, plenty of market participants expect a dramatic correction and even new multi-year lows of $12,000 or worse.\n\nOthers believe that the good times can continue and even see BTC/USD reach $30,000 before checking its relief rally.\n\nIn the meantime, however, some are focused on another line in the sand much closer to current spot price.\n\nFor Swift, the area around $25,000 is now especially significant. This, he noted in a tweet on Jan. 24, is where bears begin to get liquidated en masse.\n\nIt is also the site of Bitcoin\u2019s 200-week moving average (WMA), a key trend line which has been absent from the chart since the middle of 2022, when it failed to act as support. Bitcoin has since spent a record amount of time below the 200WMA, which currently sits at around $24,750.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of liquidity from $24,700 - $25,900 which lines up with the 200WMA and the area just above it,\u201d Swift commented.\n\nBTC/USD liquidity chart (screenshot).

        "content": "Disclaimer: This article has been updated for clarity regarding the veracity of certain claims to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym used by the creator(s) of Bitcoin, whose true identity remains unknown. The name was used to author the original Bitcoin (BTC) white paper in 2008 and to create and deploy the first Bitcoin software in 2009. Nakamoto\u2019s true identity has never been revealed, and they have remained an enigma in the world of cryptocurrency. They are estimated to have mined around 1 million BTC in the early days of the network, which would make them one of the wealthiest people in the world.\n\nSome believe that Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for an individual, while others maintain that it could be a group of people.\n\nMany have been nominated as possible inventors while others have made the claim that they themselves are the inventor of Bitcoin. Below is a list of just a handful of such individuals. Newcomers to the crypto industry should note that these claims are highly disputed and that no official conclusion has been reached regarding the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nNick Szabo\n\nNick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer known for his research on digital contracts and digital currency. He is credited with developing the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into the code. Szabo first proposed the idea of smart contracts in 1994 in an article titled \"Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets.\u201d\n\nSzabo is also known for his work on digital currency and cryptography and is considered a pioneer in digital money. He created a precursor to Bitcoin called \u201cBit Gold,\u201d which he described in a series of blog posts in the late 1990s.\n\nSzabo speaking at an event. Source: The U.S. Sun\n\nSzabo is considered by many to be a likely candidate for the true identity of Nakamoto, but he has denied it.\n\nHe is also a legal scholar and has written extensively on the legal implications of digital contracts and digital currency. He is an advocate of digital freedom and privacy and has written on the intersection of cryptography and civil liberties.\n\nHal Finney\n\nHal Finney was a computer programmer and early Bitcoin contributor. He was one of the first people to run the Bitcoin software and was an active member of the community in the years following its creation. Finney was also a developer of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software, which is widely used to secure email communications.\n\nHal Finney and his wife Fran Finney. Source: Braiins\n\nHe was a well-known figure in the Bitcoin community and was recognized for his contributions to its development. He was also a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and wrote extensively on the technology\u2019s potential in various forums and social media platforms.\n\nFinney denied the claims that he created Bitcoin but acknowledged having received the first Bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto. He passed away in 2014 due to complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. He was widely respected and honored within the Bitcoin community.\n\nDorian Nakamoto\n\nDorian Nakamoto is a retired Japanese-American engineer and physicist whose name was put forward as a potential Satoshi Nakamoto in a 2014 article by Leah McGrath Goodman in the magazine Newsweek.\n\nDorian Nakamoto denied the allegations, stating that he had never heard of Bitcoin before the article was published and that he had no involvement in creating the cryptocurrency. He also said he was not fluent in English and felt that the interviewer had taken his statements out of context.\n\nNakamoto thanks the Bitcoin community in a YouTube video. Source: Dara Kerr/CNET\n\nDespite his denial, the article sparked a media frenzy, with journalists and members of the public staking out Dorian Nakamoto\u2019s home and attempting to contact him for interviews. The attention caused a great deal of stress for him and his family, and he later sought legal advice to deal with the situation.

He has been a private person since then, and not much is known about him or his activities.\n\nCraig Wright\n\nCraig Wright is an Australian computer scientist and businessman who has publicly claimed to be Nakamoto. Wright first made the claims in 2016 and later provided some technical information that according to him provided evidence to support them.\n\nWright has been a controversial figure in the cryptocurrency community, and his claims to be Nakamoto have been met with great skepticism. Many experts in the field have stated that the evidence presented by Wright is insufficient to prove his claim, and some have accused him of fraud.\n\nThree videos from the September trial in Oslo.

He is also an active member of the cypherpunk community, a group of activists and technologists who advocate for using cryptography to protect privacy and civil liberties.\n\nBack has denied being Nakamoto but remains a vocal advocate for privacy and has spoken out against government surveillance and the erosion of civil liberties. He is also known for his research on distributed systems, writing several papers and articles on the subject.\n\nWei Dai\n\nWei Dai is a computer scientist and cryptographer known for his contributions to the development of digital currency. He is best known for his work on digital cash and electronic payment systems and is considered one of the field\u2019s pioneers.\n\nDai\u2019s most notable contribution is the creation of B-money, an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system proposed in 1998. The concept of B-money served as an inspiration for the development of Bitcoin, and many of the ideas presented in Dai\u2019s B-money paper were later incorporated into the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nDai has denied being Nakamoto. He remains a member of the cypherpunk community.\n\nVili Lehdonvirta\n\nVili Lehdonvirta is a Finnish economist and researcher on digital culture and economies. He is a senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute of the University of Oxford, where he researches digital labor, platform economies and digital currencies. Lehdonvirta has published several papers and articles on digital currencies and online marketplaces and has been a speaker at various conferences and events on the topic.\n\nProfessor Vili Lehdonvirta. Source: Oxford Internet Institute\n\nLehdonvirta\u2019s name has been suggested as a potential Nakamoto due to his early research on digital currencies and online marketplaces. However, there is no concrete evidence linking him to the creation of Bitcoin, and Lehdonvirta himself has denied being Nakamoto. He has also been involved in various policy-making processes and has provided expert testimony on digital economy-related issues to governments and international organizations.\n\nAs noted above, these are only a small number of individuals who have claimed or been nominated as the true face behind the inventor of Bitcoin. As the crypto industry continues to develop and grow, there will likely be more theories, and it is possible that the world may never know for certain who is the real Satoshi Nakamoto."

        "title": "$1.48B in Bitcoin options expire on Friday \u2014 Will BTC hold $22K? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price faced fierce resistance at $23,000 after an 11% rally on Jan. 20, but that was enough to cause $335 million in liquidations for short positions using futures contracts. The 36% year-to-date gain to $22,500 caused bears to be ill-prepared for the $1.48 billion monthly options expiry on Jan. 27.\n\nBitcoin investor sentiment improved after signals pointing to lower inflationary pressure suggested that the U.S. Federal Reserve could soon move away from its interest rate increase and quantitative tightening. Commonly known as a pivot, the trend change would benefit risk assets such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn Jan. 22, the China-based peer-to-peer trades of USD Coin (USDC) reached a 3.5% premium versus the United States dollar, indicating moderate FOMO by retail traders. This level is the highest in more than six months, suggesting excessive cryptocurrency buying demand has pressured the indicator above fair value.\n\nThe all-time high on the seven-day Bitcoin hash rate \u2014 an estimate of processing power dedicated to mining \u2014 also supported the bullish momentum. The indicator peaked at 276.9 exo-hash per second (EH/s) on Jan. 19, signaling a reversion of the recent weakness caused by miners facing financial difficulties.\n\nDespite the bears\u2019 best efforts, Bitcoin has been trading above $20,000 since Jan. 14 \u2014 a movement that explains why the $1.48 billion Bitcoin monthly options expiry will vastly benefit bulls despite the recent failure to break the $23,200 resistance.\n\nBulls were too optimistic, but remain well positioned\n\nBitcoin\u2019s latest rally on Jan. 20 caught bears by surprise, as a mere 6% of the put (sell) options for the monthly expiry have been placed above $22,000. Thus, bulls are better positioned even though they set nearly 40% of their call (buy) options at $23,000 or higher.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Nov. 25. Source: CoinGlass\n\nA broader view using the 1.15 call-to-put ratio shows more bullish bets because the call (buy) open interest stands at $790 million against the $680 million put (sell) options. Nevertheless, most bearish bets will likely become worthless as Bitcoin is up 36% in January.\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price remains above $22,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Jan. 27, only $38 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because there is no use in the right to sell Bitcoin at $21,000 or $22,000 if it trades higher on expiry.\n\nBears could secure a $595 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Jan. 27 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $20,000 and $21,000: 12,800 calls vs. 7,100 puts. The net result favors bulls by $115 million.\n\n12,800 calls vs. 7,100 puts. The net result favors bulls by $115 million. Between $21,000 and $22,000: 17,600 calls vs. 2,800 puts. The net result favors bulls by $320 million.\n\n17,600 calls vs. 2,800 puts. The net result favors bulls by $320 million. Between $22,000 and $23,000: 21,200 calls vs. 1,100 puts. Bulls remain in control, profiting $455 million.\n\n21,200 calls vs. 1,100 puts. Bulls remain in control, profiting $455 million. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 25,300 calls vs. 0 puts. Bulls completely dominate the expiry, racking up $595 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin due for shake-up vs. gold, stocks as BTC price dips under $22.5K\n\nBitcoin bears need to push the price below $21,000 on Jan. 27 to greatly reduce their losses. However, Bitcoin bears recently had $335 million worth of liquidated leveraged short futures positions, so they likely have less margin required to exert power in the short term.\n\nConsequently, the most probable scenario for the January monthly BTC options expiry is the $22,000 or higher level, providing a decent win for bulls.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Several on-chain metrics from the Bitcoin (BTC) network are flashing buy signals following this year\u2019s rally.\n\nBitcoin has broken out of its torpor to notch up a 37% gain since the beginning of 2023. However, on-chain data is still signaling it could be a \u201cgenerational buying opportunity,\u201d according to analysts.\n\nOn Jan. 24, researcher and technical analyst \u201cGame of Trades\u201d identified six on-chain metrics for his 71,000 Twitter followers.\n\nThe first metric is an accumulation trend score highlighting zones of heavy accumulation in terms of entity size and the number of coins bought.\n\n\u201cLarge entities have been in deep accumulation mode ever since the FTX collapse,\u201d the analyst noted, adding that \u201csimilar accumulation took place in the 2018 and 2020 bottoms.\u201d\n\nBitcoin: 6 on-chain metrics calling for a generational long-term buying opportunity\n\n\n\nA thread \u2014 Game of Trades (@GameofTrades_) January 23, 2023\n\nThe Bitcoin entity-adjusted dormancy flow is a measure of the ratio of the current market capitalization and the annualized dormancy value.\n\nWhenever dormancy value overtakes market capitalization, the market can be considered in full capitulation which has been a good historical buying zone.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, this metric fell to its lowest level ever in 2022.\n\nBTC entity- adjusted dormancy flow. Image: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin\u2019s reserve risk can be used to measure the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of BTC. This also fell to its lowest-ever level at the end of 2022, according to Glassnode data.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Realized Price (RP) is the value of all coins in circulation at the price they last moved \u2014 in other words, an estimation of what the entire market paid for their coins.\n\nAccording to Woo Charts, Bitcoin has been trading below this level since FTX\u2019s collapse in November until Jan. 13. It is currently just above the RP, which represents another buying opportunity.\n\nThe Bitcoin MVRV Z-score shows when BTC is significantly over or undervalued relative to its \u201cfair value\u201d or realized price. When the metric leaves the extremely undervalued zone it is often considered the end of the bear market.\n\nBTC\u2019s MVRV Z-Score. Image: Glassnode\n\nFinally, there is the Puell Multiple examining the fundamentals of mining profitability and its impact on market cycles.\n\nLower values, as they are at the moment, indicate miner stress and represent long-term buying opportunities.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin halts volatility at $23K as BTC hodlers see mass return to profit\n\nThe analyst concluded these six on-chain metrics are \u201cpointing towards an exceptional risk-reward setup in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe metrics are all at similar levels to market cycle bottoms in 2015, 2018, and 2020, they added.\n\nAt time of publication, BTC was trading down over 1.9% over the past 24 hours at $22,675, according to Cointelegraph data."

        "title": "Film review: 'Human B' shows a personal journey with Bitcoin - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The human side of Bitcoin (BTC) is seldom explored in legacy or mainstream crypto media outlets. Even within the Bitcoin space, Bitcoin is \u201cnumber goes up\u201d technology, while catchphrases like \u201cBitcoin to the moon\u201d and \u201chave fun staying poor\u201d rattle around like coins in a jar.\n\nBitcoin documentaries tend to sensationalize Bitcoin as a panacea to the world\u2019s problems instead of offering nuanced portrayals of Bitcoin\u2019s impact on the individuals who form the decentralized movement.\n\nMoreover, while the price per Bitcoin has inflated, ballooned and popped over the past five years, a steady stream of new people is flowing into the Bitcoin space. Human B follows the journey of a man named Jan as he becomes a resolute Bitcoin believer. The film hovers around Jan, the \u201cnormal citizen\u201d who, during a break between jobs, starts to learn more about fiat, or government-issued, money.\n\nJan was an editor and musician prior to his journey into Bitcoin.\n\nIn the film, Jan explains that fiat money is \u201cbad\u201d because it\u2019s limitless. Fiat money is designed to lose its purchasing power over time.\n\n\u201cI was extremely irritated at first because I thought, how is this possible? Why am I just casually discovering this while all the experts are wrong?\u201d\n\nThe epiphany sends him spiraling down the proverbial Bitcoin rabbit hole, and he sets off on a journey to Miami, Florida. \u201cI\u2019m not the first to run into a crowd,\u201d he concedes, but \u201cI feel that this is about something really crucial.\u201d\n\nRecent: Amid crypto winter, central banks rethink in-house digital currencies\n\nThe film also interviews a number of key figures in the industry, including Marc Friedrich, a best-selling German author; Alessandro Ceceres, a Venezuelan who is now marketing manager at Luxor; and Anita Posch, a Bitcoin activist. These interviews provide valuable insights into the motivations and goals of the people driving growth in the Bitcoin economy, as well as their thoughts on the future of this emerging technology.\n\nAn artsy, nuanced take that avoids clich\u00e9, lazy pop culture memes and slapdash cutaways to soundbites of Michael Saylor, Max Keiser or Jack Mallers, directors Aaron Mucke and Eva M\u00fchlenb\u00e4umer take a soft approach to the story arc. At a gentle rhythm, the story uses wit, character and charisma to give life to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s invention.\n\nPierre Corbin, a Bitcoin consultant and documentary maker shared his opinion on Human B with Cointelegraph: \u201cI liked how the beginning shows the Bitcoin culture and the passion of the people working in the space, all while being intellectuals. It is shown for newbies that are not maxis and understand the Bitcoin pop culture. I could show it to my family and maybe they would finally understand why I am obsessed.\u201d\n\nAmong the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, the film takes the viewer from Germany to Austria to Mexico and, finally, to Miami, where El Salvador's Bitcoin Law is first announced. And while the film\u2019s focus is on protagonist Jan, who slowly plans, then executes, his trip to Miami\u2019s Bitcoin 2021 Conference. The documentary collates quirky interviews with well-known German Bitcoiners.\n\nGigi, a pseudonymous household name among Bitcoin circles, stars as a giggly, eccentric man dressed in a greenscreen suit. To those new to Bitcoin, Gigi is a software engineer and Bitcoin author whose true identity is not known.\n\nGigi in his element.\n\nHe bounces around an art studio, explaining complex Bitcoin concepts with graffiti. The German paints Bitcoin equations onto white walls while sporting a chroma-key bodysuit, sunglasses fit for a Matrix remake and over-ear headphones. He chuckles away to the viewer, explaining that Bitcoin employs \u201cmeme warfare.\u201d\n\nGigi sits on a Matrix chair, taking the viewer through \"meme warfare.\"\n\nElsewhere, a relaxed Anita Posch \u2014 another German-speaking Bitcoin educator \u2014 details her love of Bitcoin\u2019s use in Africa. She narrates personal stories while the camera follows her cycle through rolling Austrian hills, such as the story behind the Bitcoin tattoo on her wrist. She explains that the thunderbolt\u2013a nod to the Lightning Network\u2013stands for \u201cenergy,\u201d when asked by those who haven\u2019t understood Bitcoin yet.\n\nRecent: Going cashless: Norway's digital currency project raises privacy questions\n\nThe tattoo scene is a neat hint at one of the film\u2019s underlying messages: Bitcoin is misunderstood. Rooted under the headlines, the mudslinging and the memes that dominate the Bitcoin space, the profound impact of Bitcoin on human lives is slowly bearing fruit. From Senegal to El Salvador, Switzerland to Indonesia, stories of how Bitcoin has changed lives for the better are gracing the world \u2014 but those stories live underneath the headlines.\n\nPosch cycles through central Europe.\n\nSupport and analysis from mainstream reporter Friedemann Brenneis fleshes out further details on why Bitcoin is so misunderstood. He pins media headlines to a board, demonstrating that, contrary to popular reports that Bitcoin is dead, there\u2019s \u201cmore to it than the media reports.\u201d\n\nBrenneis takes stock of mainstream media narratives.\n\nAs Corbin told Cointelegraph, Human B is the sort of documentary that you could show to friends or family who are not sold on Bitcoin and they might finally get it. Plus, the animations and narrative details are well-crafted yet instructive. Corbin highlighted one of these creative touches: \u201cFor example, when the fiat monetary system is explained and the banker gives out the loans by pressing \u2018Enter\u2019 repeatedly.\u201d\n\nIn all, amid a sea of Bitcoin documentaries that, at times, feel like propaganda or clarion calls for greater Bitcoin adoption, Human B is a thoughtful, personal account. It recently hit 250,000 views on YouTube and is also available on Vimeo.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Top 10 Bitcoin Alternatives One Must Consider in 2023 - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Here are 10 bitcoin alternatives that have held on throughout steep price climbs and plunges\n\nBitcoin is a synonym for cryptocurrency. It is single-handedly leading the pack of cryptocurrencies in terms of popularity and market capitalization. But there are many Bitcoin alternatives like Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Cardano, Binance Coin, and more that can be strong options for diversifying your crypto portfolio. In the ocean of 20,000+ cryptocurrencies, let\u2019s check out the top 10 Bitcoin alternatives you must consider before your next investment:\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is Bitcoin\u2019s largest competitor. Being the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, it\u2019s also the biggest platform for decentralized applications. The applications on Ethereum are run on ether, its platform-specific cryptographic token. Bitcoin is primarily a store of value and medium of exchange; Ethereum is seen as a general-purpose blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash has marked a milestone as one of the first altcoins that emerged and successfully traded off from bitcoin. The cryptocurrency emerged as a solution to the unsettling issues between bitcoin developers and miners. Bitcoin Cash got split from bitcoin\u2019s chain and created its own path towards adoption and growing market capitalization.\n\nShiba Inu\n\nShiba Inu is one of the most popular meme coins with a large and active community. Being a deflationary cryptocurrency, it can be good for long-term value growth. At present, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001212, with a 24-hour trading volume of $389,319,671.\n\nDogecoin\n\nOften called a \u2018meme coin,\u2019 dogecoin is the first cryptocurrency that came out from the Shiba Inu joke that trended on the internet years back. After maintaining a low profile for many since its inception in 2013, dogecoin showed its potential in 2020 when it was accepted as a payment model among sports teams and entered the AMC theaters.\n\nSolana\n\nSoaring by more than 11,000% throughout 2021, Solana created history. Although it is trading below its all-time high of $260 in 2022, Solana has outperformed the majority of other cryptocurrencies, which makes it one of the top 10 Bitcoin alternatives.\n\nTether\n\nTehter is born out as the brainchild of people who thought that the cryptocurrency market was very volatile and unsettling. As the foremost stable coin, the tether is pegged to the US dollar and experiences fewer fluctuations compared to bitcoin. This alone makes the cryptocurrency the best alternative for bitcoin.\n\nRipple\n\nRipple Network is a network that has been developed to provide quick and secure transactions to banks, especially by using blockchain technology. The Ripple system scores better than the bitcoin network for its lower processing times and lower transaction charges.\n\nBinance Coin\n\nBNB is the cryptocurrency promoted by Binance Coin exchange. Unlike bitcoin that just acts as a cryptocurrency, Binance Coin is both a virtual token and a crypto exchange platform that could pump up value based on its market performance. Besides, the platform also incentivizes users with BNB coins over transactions, enhancing the circulation of the token as much as possible.\n\nCardano\n\nCardano is one of the most fundamentally strong and best Bitcoin alternatives in the market today. With low transaction fees and continued developments in Cardano\u2019s ecosystem, the coin does have an advantage over both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nLitecoin\n\nReferred as the \u2018silver to bitcoin\u2019s gold,\u2019 Litecoin was launched in 2011 with much of its functionalities similar to bitcoin. Litecoin was created by an MIT graduate and former Google engineer, Charlie Lee. With an open-source global payment network, Litecoin can add faster blocks compared to bitcoin, which contributes to its faster transaction time.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe podcasting revenue model is getting a Bitcoin facelift.\n\nLooking to expand its footprint beyond gaming, mobile payment firm ZEBEDEE announced Tuesday its partnership with the \u201clisten-to-earn\u201d podcast platform Fountain to give listeners and podcasters the ability to earn Bitcoin using the app.\n\n\u201cWith this partnership, we\u2019re supporting a new type of business model and economic activity, not just for the payments space, but in general,\u201d ZEBEDEE\u2019s chief strategy officer Ben Cousens said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaunched in October 2019, ZEBEDEE is a Bitcoin-centric gaming firm that releases games through its mobile app. ZEBEDEE recently launched two new play-to-earn games, Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch, a digital scratch-card game with mobile game studio Viker.\n\nWith play-to-earn games, a user plays online games and receives rewards with real-world value. Listen-to-earn aims to do something similar for podcasters, creating a direct link between podcasters and their audience and letting listeners earn Bitcoin for every minute they tune in.\n\nInstead of an expensive and sweeping ad campaign, the listen-to-earn model aims to only spend money on listeners who actually want to listen.\n\n\u201cWhen money moves as seamlessly as information, or in this case, audio, it just opens up a world of possibilities, and we\u2019re happy to be pioneering what that means in the podcasting space alongside Fountain,\u201d Cousens said.\n\nFountain, ZEBEDEE and \u2018listen-to-earn\u2019\n\nFountain launched its listen-to-earn program in June 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe program allows listeners and podcasters to get rewarded for the value they provide. Fountain users will earn money for their first hour of daily podcast listening.\n\nTo draw in listeners, the platform uses RSS feeds to make podcasts from other platforms available to its listeners. Using the Fountain app to listen to their favorite podcast, users earn small amounts of Bitcoin, called sats or satoshis, after the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nWhen the user is ready to cash out, they connect to the ZEBEDEE app to withdraw.\n\n\u201cThis type of Value for Value exchange is the future of content creation,\u201d Fountain\u2019s founder and CEO Oscar Merry said in a press release.\n\n\u201cA few years from now, we\u2019ll look back at when we paid subscriptions for content platforms that aren\u2019t related to how much we actually use those platforms and laugh at how basic and inefficient it was,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Crypto needs cheap energy. It found a whole bunch in Nebraska. - KOLN",
        "content": "KEARNEY, Neb. (Flatwater Free Press) - On an 11-acre plot in Kearney sit dozens of what look like shipping containers.\n\nInside the metal boxes are racks and racks of computers. Thousands of them, solving complicated math equations \u2018round the clock.\n\nHere on the outskirts of town, wedged between a solar field and a corn field, the thousands of computers mine for cryptocurrency.\n\nTogether, they use as much electricity as the entire city of Kearney, pop. 33,790, to do it.\n\nThis is one of the largest cryptocurrency data centers in Nebraska \u2013 a host site for the computers racing to verify crypto transactions and add to the digital currency.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely the first of many such centers to set up shop in the state, as the still new and oft-volatile crypto industry carves out a home in rural America.\n\nNebraska's Electricity Rates (Graphic by Hanscom Park Studio)\n\nThe instability of crypto has already hit the Kearney location \u2013 in September, Compute North, the company that opened the data center, declared bankruptcy. The Kearney property was sold to Generate Capital, one of the company\u2019s lenders.\n\nBut even freefalling crypto prices, the infamous failure of crypto exchange FTX and the arrest of its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried haven\u2019t stopped the industry\u2019s expansion in Nebraska.\n\nJust last week, the Hall County Board of Commissioners approved the construction of a 14-megawatt crypto data center near Grand Island.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t actively pursuing these, they came to us,\u201d said Neal Niedfeldt, chief executive officer of Southern Public Power District, one of many Nebraska utility districts fielding crypto company calls in recent years.\n\nA digital currency, crypto relies on a network of computers maintaining a blockchain \u2013 think of it like a digital ledger of transactions. The computers solve complicated math problems to verify transactions and add them to the ledger. In exchange, they receive digital \u201ccoins\u201d \u2013 like bitcoin or ethereum \u2013 along the way.\n\nThe currency is largely unregulated and not tied to banks. It\u2019s not backed by any government, like the U.S. dollar or the British pound. For crypto enthusiasts, the decentralized structure is part of the appeal.\n\n\u201cBasically, the business of crypto is converting electricity into computer computations,\u201d said Gus Hurwitz, a law professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law.\n\nBusinesses like Compute North in Kearney function as a rental space for the computers making it all run. Crypto miners ship in their equipment, paying for space, maintenance, internet and \u2013 crucially \u2013 electricity.\n\nWith computers running virtually 24/7, and fans running to cool them, electricity is the main cost of doing business. The companies running these hubs need power. They\u2019re looking for it cheap.\n\nAbout five years ago, Compute North found it in Nebraska \u2013 the only state served entirely by publicly owned utilities mandated to deliver the cheapest electricity possible.\n\n\u201cThey had heard our rates are low, and they\u2019re stable,\u201d said Nicole Sedlacek, economic development manager for NPPD. \u201cThat ultimately led them to put in a phone call to us.\u201d\n\nThe company had a few other criteria: They liked the power district\u2019s mix of carbon-free energy. They needed affordable land. They sought a place with the capacity to handle their massive electrical load, and a local government open to the idea of crypto coming to town.\n\nKearney had everything they were looking for.\n\nThe central Nebraska town had already been trying to develop its technology park. It was in the running for a Facebook data center, but lost the bid to Altoona, Iowa, about a decade ago.\n\nA crypto data center promised jobs, but not in a way that would strain housing or take workers from employers already in town, said Stan Clouse, mayor for 20 years.\n\nClouse is also an NPPD account manager. He spent the first meeting with Compute North asking about their energy needs. What the mayor heard excited him, he said.\n\nNPPD had enough electrical capacity to handle the data center, and wouldn\u2019t need to generate more power specifically for Compute North. The data center would double the electrical capacity of Kearney\u2019s power grid, making power more stable and keeping rates low. It would also mean an influx of cash.\n\n\u201cIncreasing the load increases revenue, which goes into the Kearney general fund,\u201d Clouse said. \u201cThat\u2019s an excess of $1 million annually to Kearney. For a community our size, that\u2019s pretty significant.\u201d\n\nBut for some, the Kearney data center, and others soon to be running in Grand Island and York, aren\u2019t to be celebrated. They\u2019re a cause for concern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about job creation and opportunity for Nebraska,\u201d said Scott Scholz, a spokesperson for the newly formed advocacy group Nebraskans for Social Good. \u201cIt\u2019s about out-of-state companies leveraging our electrical system for their own profit.\u201d\n\nSave for Clouse, who abstained because of his utility role, the Kearney City Council voted unanimously in June 2019 to approve a development agreement with Compute North.\n\nThe company received 11 acres of free land, valued at $165,000 and paid for by the Economic Development Council of Buffalo County. The city gave the company a rebate on electricity, capped at $1.1 million. The company hit that cap in August.\n\nThen-Lt. Gov. Mike Foley, NPPD President and CEO Pat Pope, and Kearney Mayor Stan Clouse (left to right) watch as former Compute North President and CEO Dave Perrill speaks at the August 2019 groundbreaking of the Kearney crypto data center. Since then, the data center has changed hands after Compute North declared bankruptcy in September 2022. (Economic Development Council of Buffalo County)\n\nNebraska Public Power added mobile substations to help accommodate the increased load. The utility district is working on a new $12.5 million permanent substation that will exclusively transmit energy to the crypto-mining location.\n\nIn return, Compute North promised jobs, and delivered 11. It helped develop and add to the electrical capacity of Kearney\u2019s tech park. By 2021, it grew to be a 100-megawatt customer.\n\nBy comparison: The entire city\u2019s energy needs peak at 100 megawatts. The second largest user in Kearney is the manufacturing company Eaton, peaking at 10 megawatts, Clouse said.\n\nThe data center\u2019s load is enormous and consistent \u2013 it doesn\u2019t fluctuate through the day like the energy usage in a home or factory, said Pat Hanrahan, NPPD\u2019s general manager of retail services. And it\u2019s flexible. If NPPD needs more power from the grid to heat homes during a cold winter, for example, the data center can easily pause.\n\nBut the huge amount of electricity usage raises environmental concerns, Scholz said.\n\nOne year of global mining for cryptocurrency uses more electricity than the country of Argentina, according to an estimate in a White House report on crypto and climate change \u2013 as much as nearly 1% of the world\u2019s annual electricity usage.\n\nIn New York, lawmakers recently passed a two-year ban on fossil fuel-powered crypto mining projects. In Montana, a coal-fired power plant was set to shut down, cheering environmentalists \u2013 until a crypto data center opened nearby.\n\nIn Nebraska, NPPD already had the energy capacity to power the Kearney data center, Hanrahan said. The public utility didn\u2019t need to build new power generation to supply it.\n\nRoughly 62% of NPPD\u2019s energy generation is carbon-free, a number that remained steady before and after Compute North came to Kearney, said Grant Otten, NPPD spokesperson.\n\nStill, a data center\u2019s constant energy usage is likely to draw from all available energy sources, said Bruce Dvorak, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln civil engineering professor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming from a mix of more green sources, like wind, as well as not-so-green sources, like coal and natural gas,\u201d Dvorak said.\n\nOver the past five years, NPPD\u2019s economic development arm has fielded calls from about 25 different crypto companies interested in Nebraska, Sedlacek said. The calls increased when China banned crypto in 2021.\n\nSome towns, like Kearney, were open to the idea, Sedlacek said. Others have been more hesitant. They welcomed economic development.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t want crypto,\u201d they told her.\n\nThe crypto market is young, widely unfamiliar to the general public and wildly speculative and volatile. In November 2021, the price of bitcoin peaked at $68,764. Since then, it\u2019s crashed by 75%, plunging to $16,625 in January.\n\nIn November, the crypto exchange company FTX filed for bankruptcy, shaking the already fraught industry. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was then arrested for multiple counts of fraud, sowing more distrust among crypto skeptics.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely at a low point in the industry right now,\u201d said Hurwitz, the law professor. \u201cIt\u2019s possible we could get lower. Anyone entering into this market right now needs to be better capitalized, and capitalized in a less risky way than they likely were a year ago.\u201d\n\nCompute North, the company that opened Kearney\u2019s data center, declared bankruptcy late last year, citing rising energy costs and profits that couldn\u2019t keep pace as bitcoin value plummeted. The bankruptcy didn\u2019t interrupt local operations. Today, the cluster of computers between a cornfield and a solar field continue verifying transactions and mining new cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cBecause they can move in so quickly, they can move out rather quickly, too,\u201d said Sedlacek, the NPPD economic development manager. \u201cWe spent a lot of time as a utility really talking through that. How can we protect our ratepayers so we aren\u2019t left stranded with assets and unpaid bills?\u201d\n\nShe thought the calls would slow last year, when the digital currencies cratered. But the companies kept calling.\n\nA handful of other projects are now in the works in Nebraska.\n\nThe York City Council decided in April to sell land to BginUSA, an Omaha company wanting to build an $8 million mining complex. In Minden, an expansion Compute North had planned is in the process of being transferred to New York-based Foundry Digital.\n\nIn November, a group of residents opposed to a proposed crypto data center near Doniphan crowded a Hall County Commissioners public hearing.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a farm facility going in,\u201d resident Justin Gregg said during public comment, according to NTV News. \u201cWe grew up around a corn field. It\u2019s all corn fields around us, and should stay that way.\u201d\n\nThe interested company pulled its request for a conditional use permit before the commissioners voted.\n\nThis week, Hall County approved a conditional use permit for a different crypto project near Grand Island.\n\nQuestions loom around cryptocurrency\u2019s future, including possible regulation and market prices. Last year, the Biden Administration released recommendations on future U.S. regulation.\n\nNebraska towns and utility districts now hopefully fully understand the risks they might face with crypto companies, Hurwitz said.\n\n\u201cCompanies, municipalities, investors, bankers, lenders \u2013 anyone who was willing to fund things \u2013 is going to be doing so with much more awareness of the risks,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not be willing to take anything on credit.\u201d\n\nWith crypto\u2019s future uncertain, Sedlacek asks companies who call NPPD: What do you see this looking like in the future? And what happens if crypto goes away?\n\nMany have told her they may eventually pivot their mass computer power to other industries, maybe banking, finance or health care.\n\n\u201cThey really say that cryptocurrency is really their first step into this high-computing space,\u201d Sedlacek said.\n\nCopyright 2023 KOLN.

        "content": "Vivek Ramaswamy is an entrepreneur and author. In this interview, we discuss his thesis that social and political struggles are rooted in the rise of a managerial class dominating society at the expense of everyday citizens. We also talk about the need to revive a binding national identity, and how the social justice movement may be causing more harm than good.\n\n- - - -\n\nPublic choice theory influenced a generation of conservatives around the world in the 1970s and 80s. In essence, the theory applied economic thinking to political behaviour. It undermined the notion of public interest: it was a nebulous irrelevance in relation to public policy as all individuals, including politicians and bureaucrats, work in their own self-interest.\n\nWhat resulted was the development of a managerial class that would be incentivized to achieve specific aims through monetary rewards. This class has grown since the 1980s to now represent, in some people\u2019s views, an oversized controlling force within society. However, their decision-making is increasingly outside of the purview and influence of ordinary citizens.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy believes this friction between managers and everyday people is at the root of the current social and political struggles within society. Exacerbating these tensions are increasing incidents of managers being coopted by elites to do their bidding, undermining constitutional norms. Vivek believes that we are now at a defining moment when the defining principles of political organisation need to be reviewed.\n\nThe ideals and principles of the United States, as laid out in the constitution, became a unifying force around which a vibrant national identity was developed. This, until very recently, facilitated and supported American hegemony. But, in short order, that binding sense of a united vision has been replaced by factionalised ideologies that threaten the viability of the American experiment.\n\nThe fundamental issue is that the notion of Americanism has been allowed to wither. Vivek believes that to combat China and meet the other great challenges of our age, America must find again a shared national identity that eclipses current partisan divisions. In essence, the US must retrace its steps before venturing forward."

        "content": "The U.K. government\u2019s economic and finance ministry, His Majesty\u2019s Treasury, is recruiting for a head of central bank digital currency (CBDC) to lead the development of a digital pound. The work is described as \u201cimportant, complex, and cross-cutting\u201d and will \u201crequire extensive engagement across and beyond the HM Treasury.\u201d\n\nAccording to the LinkedIn post, the Treasury and the Bank of England are working together through the CBDC Taskforce to explore the case for a digital pound. The role of the head of CBDC may bring the United Kingdom\u2019s government closer to its aim of rolling out a CBDC.\n\nHM Treasury\u2019s job posting for a CBDC head. Source: LinkedIn\n\nDanny Scott, CEO of U.K.-based Bitcoin (BTC) company CoinCorner, told Cointelegraph that a CBDC could be missing the \u201cactual real-world use and purpose, which is what we often see.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor those that have been in the industry for a cycle or two, we\u2019ve seen the hypes come and go \u2014 altcoins, blockchain, distributed ledger, ICOs, DeFi, NFTs. You see large companies come along and jump on the latest hype to avoid looking like they\u2019re falling behind. It falls under R&D and exploratory for most, which is perfectly understandable.\u201d\n\nScott, who has been working and building in the Bitcoin space for over a decade, explained that sometimes, the public could misinterpret the research and development projects in the crypto space and perhaps confuse them with useful real-world solutions.\n\n\u201cA CBDC [digital pound] doesn\u2019t fall far from this. Many countries around the world are exploring this and trying to understand the benefits of this over the current system \u2014 fair enough, this will happen.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the move toward a digital pound matches the trend among central banks worldwide to explore the potential of CBDCs. In Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been actively studying the future of a digital euro, and several countries, including Sweden and Denmark, are also exploring their own digital currencies.\n\nCBDCs claim to offer a number of benefits, including improved financial inclusion, reduced costs for businesses and consumers, and increased security and efficiency in the payment system.\n\nHowever, El Salvador banked as much as 70% of its unbanked population with the introduction of Bitcoin as legal tender, while countries such as Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya can now receive money from around the world to a mobile phone or Bitcoin exchange account.\n\nPaying for coffee in El Salvador using Bitcoin. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nMoreover, there are potential risks to introducing a new digital currency. James Dewar, partner at U.K. Bitcoin merchant solution Bridge2Bitcoin and a director at Laser Eyes Cards, told Cointelegraph that the \u201cintroduction of a CBDC would itself present different challenges and risks than Bitcoin,\u201d as the CBDC requires \u201ctrust in third parties, central banks and governments, to not abuse the supply of the currency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis risk applies at the macro level as it does today, but more worryingly with a CBDC on the ability for a government or its agencies to monitor and censor individual spending. This is a huge risk for the rights of freedom and property ownership within our societies.\u201d\n\nHe raises the question, \u201cWhilst we may trust one government or another, do we as citizens trust all future governments, of whatever color, with this power?\u201d Tony Yates, a former senior adviser to the Bank of England, has spoken out against CBDCs. Resonating Dewar\u2019s thoughts, he questioned the motivations behind the global rollouts of CBDCs, calling them \u201csuspect.\u201d\n\nDewar continued, \u201cIt is reasonable that government explore the idea properly. Overall, we worry that there may be political pressure brought to the process that ignores or significantly downplays the risks to society of a CBDC.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cdigital\u201d aspect of money is also brought into question. The U.K. is increasingly a digital cash-based society: Less than 15% of payments are made with physical cash according to the Bank of England, and as many as 23 million people \u2014 about one-third of the U.K. population \u2014 did not use cash at all in 2021.\n\nCointelegraph reporter Joe Hall races contactless payments, Bitcoin vs. pounds sterling in Gibraltar. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nScott asks of the treasury, \u201cDon\u2019t we already have a digital pound?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom an end-consumer perspective, the pound is mostly digital these days regardless of the mechanism used. So, once they have finished their exploratory stages, I would love to see a list of the benefits and new features a CBDC will bring to the public.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Scott will \u201ccontinue to focus on Bitcoin and making a global, interoperable system everyone can participate in.\u201d\n\nRelated: Amid crypto winter, central banks rethink in-house digital currencies\n\nDewar shared that there could be hope for Bitcoin and the U.K. government: \u201cThe role description notes that the emergence of private sector money \u2014 such as Bitcoin \u2014 offers exciting opportunities for U.K. businesses and consumers, and we would very much agree with that at Bridge2Bitcoin.\u201d The Bank of England CBDC, by design, will be available to Brits, although no official timeline is set."

        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lending firm BlockFi reportedly has plans to sell off $160 million in loans backed by around 68,000 Bitcoin mining machines as part of bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nIn a Bloomberg report on Jan. 24, two people \u201cfamiliar with the matter\u201d claimed that BlockFi started the process of selling off the loans last year.\n\nThe crypto lender filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November, citing its significant exposure to the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX for its downfall.\n\nHowever, some of these loans have already defaulted since then and could be undercollateralized given the decline in the price of Bitcoin mining equipment, according to the sources, adding the last day for bidders to submit offers for the loans is Jan. 24.\n\nIn comments to Cointelegraph, crypto lawyer Harrison Dell \u2014 director of Australian law firm Cadena Legal \u2014 explained that if Bitcoin mining equipment used as collateral is worth less than the value of the loans, the loans are \u201cnot worth their paper value anymore to BlockFi.\u201d\n\nDell said that the people bidding for the debts are likely to be debt collection businesses buying for \u201ccents on the dollar.\u201d\n\nHe added that selling the debt is likely \u201call that the administrators\u201d for BlockFi can salvage for these assets.\n\nDell also suggested that this is just the beginning of what\u2019s to come for the crypto industry. He noted:\n\n\u201cThis is just the start of the asset sales from BlockFi and other crypto firms in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph reached out to BlockFi for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.\n\nBlockFi\u2019s attempt to liquidate its loans is likely part of efforts to pay off its creditors, which according to its bankruptcy filing in November, number over 100,000.\n\nAt the time of its bankruptcy, it was reported that BlockFi sold $239 million of its own cryptocurrency assets to cover the bankruptcy expenses and warned approximately 70% of its staff that they would lose their jobs.\n\nRelated: BlockFi bankruptcy filing triggers a wide range of community reactions\n\nEarlier this week, BlockFi petitioned the court in a Jan. 23 declaration to release funds to allow bonuses for key employees in a bid to retain them amid the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nBlockFi\u2019s chief people officer Megan Crowell told the court that without financial incentives, it\u2019s unlikely the company will be able to retain its employees.\n\nCrowell said it is highly likely many staff will leave the company without competitive compensation, noting that it would add further financial impact to the company down the road."

        "content": "For the first time since November 7, 2022, flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, showed some signs of recovery. The cryptocurrency, which traded below $17,000 since the FTX issue, rose above $21,000 on Thursday, January 14, 2023.\n\nAs expected, traders, investors, and enthusiasts were excited to see the little ray of sunshine even though it is a far cry from the $68,000 price the cryptocurrency crashed from.\n\nThe value of the entire crypto market rose to $990 million, rising \u223c19% from $831 million in November 2022.\n\nCrypto influencer and full-time trader, Ademi, said the rise is likely due to a reduced supply of bitcoin and ethereum in the market. CNBC corroborated Ademi\u2019s stance, saying there\u2019s been a huge buyup of the cryptocurrency by large buyers known as whales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Ademi, the current rise in the price of bitcoin is a breath of fresh air after a long crypto winter. While she\u2019s optimistic about prices rising further, she admits there\u2019s no telling if this is the beginning of another bull run or a brief moment of happiness for traders like her.\n\nBitcoin price in the last month. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nGreen strokes on the crypto chart could be a sign to get into the market and make some profit. However, there\u2019s a need to understand why the market is on the rise and if it is sustainable.\n\nHere are two things you should know before you invest in crypto\n\nWhy is the crypto market on the rise?\n\nAccording to Micheal Ugwu, angel investor CEO of FreeMe Digital, bitcoin is on the rise because economic metrics in the US weren\u2019t as bad as it was expected to be. For example, the inflation rate dropped from 7.10% to 6.5%, making traders optimistic that interest rates would drop.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin was one way to hedge against inflation, but it didn\u2019t do that in 2022. The cryptocurrency is behaving similar to the stock market playing to the tunes of micro and macroeconomic factors.\n\nBe the smartest in the room Join 30,000 subscribers who receive Techpoint Digest, a fun week-daily 5-minute roundup of happenings in African and global tech, directly in your inbox, hours before everyone else. Digest Subscription Email First Name Subscribe Give it a try, you can unsubscribe anytime. Privacy Policy.\n\nThe rise has also been attributed to the activities of whales. These are people or entities that purchase large quantities of cryptocurrencies enough to move the market.\n\nAccording to crypto data firm Kaiko, trade sizes have gone from an average of $700 to $1,100 on Binance.\n\nMicheal Saylor, CEO of Microstrategy, is a well-known crypto whale who bought $45 million worth of Bitcoin in December 2022. When whales sweep up cryptocurrencies in large volumes, it reduces the supply of crypto, which leads to an increase in prices.\n\nThe third reason for the hike in the price of bitcoin is the increasing mining difficulty. BTC.com data revealed that mining difficulty is now at 37.6 trillion, which means it will take 37.6 trillion attempts to find a valid bitcoin block and add it to the blockchain.\n\nImage by jcomp on Freepik\n\nMetrics such as these make the cryptocurrency harder to mine, increasing its scarcity and price.\n\nWill the factors affecting the rise of bitcoin stay the same?\n\nWhile some economic factors are panning out well for bitcoin, it doesn't mean things will stay the same. According to Ugwu, the economic situation in the US doesn\u2019t change the macro economic conditions, which will affect crypto in the long run.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the global economy is projected to grow by 1.7% in 2023, a sharp downturn in growth. Judging by what happened in 2022, this figure could be worse than the World Bank's prediction.\n\nOn January 10, 2022, the World Bank warned that the global economy was \"perilously close to falling into recession.\"\n\nEven worse, the recession the World Bank envisions is going to be broad-based, with everyone everywhere in the world experiencing a significant slowdown in their earnings.\n\nThese are the macro economic factors that make Ugwu believe the hike in bitcoin price is going to be short-lived.\n\nHe said, \"everything is pumping, and I don't mind; all I know is that it's most likely short-term.\"\n\nWhile the crypto whales might sweep up enough coins to drive up prices, economic conditions across the world do not bode well for the crypto market. History, however, shows that when it comes to crypto, there\u2019s no telling what will happen."

Many people continue to think they can earn enormous profits by investing in Bitcoin, even though the cryptocurrency market is incredibly unpredictable, and it is difficult to anticipate the future price of BTC.\n\nThis article will go over some short and long-term projections for the price of Bitcoin while taking into account the coin\u2019s potential, utility and other factors into account.\n\nThe majority were unfamiliar with the notion of Bitcoin at the time of its inception and for a few years afterward. Being the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin exceeded several price targets.\n\nFor a very long time, Bitcoin was regarded as the ideal cryptocurrency, but in recent years, the market has seen the introduction of various altcoins that have proven to be superior to Bitcoin. Millions of users continue to invest in Bitcoin despite all these factors, including its popularity, potential worth and comparatively low volatility. Understanding the Bitcoin price is essential since it dominates the cryptocurrency market and influences the pricing of several altcoins.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price in 2022\n\nBitcoin is a smart choice when discussing long-term investments. The price of Bitcoin increased significantly in 2021, surpassing its previous high, but by the year\u2019s close, it fell sharply from November\u2019s peak. The experts estimate that the price of BTC will remain steady throughout the year, but another group believes that it will rise from USD 42,664 to USD 43,011. Although nothing is certain, another Bitcoin price prediction indicates that the year will end with a price of USD 37,450.\n\nExpert\u2019s forecast on the price of bitcoin in 2023\n\nThe precise price forecast for 2023 is difficult to make because different sources provide varying estimates, but the majority predicts that Bitcoin will rise to USD 70,000 and stay there for the duration of the year.\n\nSeveral trade websites forecast that the price will go to USD 65,000 this year and then reach USD 72,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nBitcoin price forecasts by experts for 2024\n\nThe maximum transaction value for bitcoin in 2024 is predicted to be over USD 84,000, with an average price of about USD 78,000. Experts anticipate a better price gain with other cryptocurrencies compared to last year.\n\nBitcoin price forecast by experts for 2025\n\nAccording to the forecasts for 2023 and 2024, Bitcoin\u2019s price will continue to climb in the years to come. The highest possible price for Bitcoin in 2025 is USD 137,071.13. On the other hand, some projections state that the price will only increase to USD 80,000 by the end of 2025.\n\nBitcoin price forecast by experts for 2026\n\nA minimum of USD 184,308.21 and a maximum of USD 214,232.74 are predicted by experts. The average value in 2026 could be around USD 186,289,04.\n\nBitcoin price forecast by experts for 2027\n\nExperts are hopeful about the price of bitcoin in 2027. In recent months, the average price has ranged between USD 280,279,966 and USD 369,103,045. A minimum price of USD 261,604.85 is predicted for Bitcoin, with a price range of USD 306,558.5.\n\nBitcoin price forecasts by experts for 2028 and 2029\n\nBitcoin\u2019s maximum predicted price in 2028 is USD 386,385, with an estimated average price of USD 319,069.36. A price increase ranging from USD 374,918.77 to USD 454,445.60 was predicted by numerous websites. The price of bitcoin might rise as high as USD 527,917.19 in 2029.\n\nBitcoin price forecast by experts for 2030\n\nSeveral well-known websites predict that the price of bitcoin could reach USD 937,274.64, with an average of USD 798,474.46. Many analysts appear to be quite optimistic about the price increase, and some have forecast an increase of at least USD 836,552.147 and as much as USD 962,484.728.\n\nMany experts have used a variety of factors to forecast the potential price of Bitcoin over the next 10 years to be more accurate.\n\nBitcoin halving occasions\n\nExperts have predicted that the value of Bitcoin will halve in 2030, taking into account the current circumstances. The first one is anticipated to occur in 2024, and the second one is most likely to take place in 2028.\n\nHow much will a Bitcoin be worth in 10 years?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is most likely to reach USD 800,000 and USD 1 million in 10 years, according to the cryptocurrency community. The value of Bitcoin is anticipated to rise steadily soon. During the final few months of 2021, the price of Bitcoin was quite close to USD 100,000. In the latter few months of 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s price was very close to USD 100,000. According to the sources, there are several variables that may significantly affect the price of Bitcoin in the future, including impending events, elevated investor confidence in the brand, an influx of institutional investors and more.\n\nPartner content written by Tom White, ASG."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has shown the highest return since October 2022 and has the best January in 10 years in monthly returns.\n\nSince the start of the year, BTC has enjoyed remarkable growth from $16,583.18 to $23,060.14 as of press time \u2013 amounting to about 39% return in 23 days.\n\nOver this month, the economy has grown across multiple sectors, with gold and the S&P500 up 19% and 13%, respectively, since last November. BTC has established itself as an important part of investment portfolios while experiencing outstanding price rallies.\n\nHowever, since the coin exceeded over $69k in November 2021, BTC has struggled for stability. For most of 2022, BTC plummeted owing to macro factors in the global market, insolvencies, and controversies rocked the industry. The coin with the highest market cap lost a significant portion of its value, dipping to $15,700 last November.\n\nPossible factors behind the recent price rally\n\nCrypto whales are likely behind the price surge, according to recent market research by Kaiko. As revealed, trade sizes have increased on Binance, which reflects that Whales are gaining confidence in the market.\n\nLikewise, inflation is slowing down in the U.S. after a series of combative measures from the Fed. The consumer price index decreased 0.1% in December every month, consistent with Dow Jones estimates.\n\nFurther, as bitcoin prices have dropped, several miners have been forced to leave the industry. Miners often accumulate massive amounts of digital currency, which makes them some of the biggest sellers. When miners sell off their bitcoin holdings to pay off debt, they remove much of the remaining selling pressure.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving sometime between March and May 2024 could provide traders with some excitement for New Year\u2019s.\n\nWhat the Future holds\n\nWhile attention is presently on the next Fed meeting, experts are watchful that the outcome of the meeting can make or break the bull run of BTC. Due to next year\u2019s halving event for BTC, they believe things will improve for BTC in the future.\n\nWhen the halving events took place years ago, the price of BTC soared. The last event, which took effect in 2020, saw BTC soar from $8,821 to $10,943 within 150 days. Mostly, the crypto community viewed the halving event to have a remarkable impact on the price of BTC as it helps to contract supply and increase its value.\n\nProfessor Carol Alexander of the University of Sussex told CNBC in December that bitcoin will see a \u201cmanaged bull market\u201d in 2023, reaching $30,000 in the first quarter and $50,000 in the second.\n\nAccording to a CryptoSlate analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) metrics, the market has reached its bottom as investors continue accumulating BTC and pushing illiquid supply to 80%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current market cap stands at $445.58 billion \u2013 up from 407.38 billion a week ago."

        "content": "Miami, Florida--(Newsfile Corp. - January 24, 2023) - Genesis Coin Inc, the first and largest Bitcoin ATM software platform worldwide announced today that they have been acquired by early Bitcoin ATM pioneers Andrew Barnard and Doug Carrillo. Founded in 2013, Genesis Coin Inc accounts for approximately 35% of all world-wide Bitcoin ATM transactions. Barnard and Carrillo, who also founded Bitstop, went on to become the first and largest private label Bitcoin ATM platform based in Miami, FL with over 2,500+ Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. Genesis Coin and Bitstop represent over 75+ operators operating 12,000+ Bitcoin ATMs in the United States and international markets which account for billions of dollars in annual sales volume.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Doug Carrillo, Evan Rose, Andrew Barnard\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Andrew Barnard will become Chief Executive Officer and Doug Carrillo will become Chief Strategy Officer and both will join the Board of Directors of Genesis Coin. Evan Rose, Genesis Coin's founder, will stay on as a technical advisor and remain a member of the company's Board of Directors. The Genesis Coin headquarters will move from Puerto Rico to Miami, Florida.\n\n\"Genesis Coin gave birth to the Bitcoin ATM industry,\" said Barnard. \"It's the first and largest Bitcoin ATM software platform in The World. Evan built a platform trusted by some of the largest Bitcoin ATM operators in our industry, both domestically and internationally, including the Chivo network in partnership with the Government of El Salvador.\n\n\"Our industry is now rapidly changing, and Genesis Coin will lead the way into the future. Accomplishing this requires a solid team of world-class visionaries and developers. At Bitstop, we built an incredible software team and platform which has partnered with some of the largest companies both private and publicly traded from the traditional ATM industry. We plan to bring our background and expertise in building the best technology and team in the Bitcoin ATM industry to Genesis Coin. We believe this is a win-win for all stakeholders,\" furthered Barnard.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Andrew, Doug, and I have been friends for a long time and have also been friendly competitors,\" commented Rose. \"They have a reputation for their innovative and creative thinking. In addition, they have been successful in establishing key relationships in the Bitcoin space and their technical expertise and knowledge of Bitcoin is very impressive. In turn, this has allowed them to attract and retain top-tier talent and build great products. This transaction represents the coming together of the two leading software platforms in the industry and creates value for both companies' stakeholders. It combines the best product, engineering, and leadership teams in the space. I'm extremely excited to work alongside them and look forward to introducing very exciting new products and services we have planned for this year,\" commented Rose.\n\nBarnard, Carrillo and Rose stressed the importance of continuing to provide stability to both platforms and continuing to service the needs of operators on both platforms. For the time being, both the Genesis Coin and Bitstop platforms will continue to run independently while exploring technical synergies. Genesis Coin has already made several key hires to their development team with a core focus on product development.\n\n\"This acquisition represents the most significant event in the Bitcoin ATM industry to date,\" said Carrillo. \"Our commitment is to provide Genesis Coin with the proper resources it needs to pave the way for continued growth and innovation. We truly believe that this new combination of the best minds in our space will be the catalyst for the Bitcoin ATM industry evolving into its next phase. We are hyper-focused on building the best software for Bitcoin ATMs in the world. Today, the most sophisticated operators in our industry rely on Genesis Coin and Bitstop technology to power their businesses. As a result, we have become 'The Standard' in the Bitcoin ATM space where virtually all industry organic M&A activity today is occurring on the Genesis Coin and Bitstop networks,\" concluded Carrillo.\n\n\"Leverage dominated the entire cryptocurrency space over the last two years. Many other platforms in our industry couldn't resist the siren song,\" said Barnard. \"This is a capital-intensive industry where you do not want to be in a lot of debt. Genesis Coin is financially secure with a strong balance sheet, no debt, and strong cash flow. The company does not have external investors. The result of this is that operators can build their future on the Genesis Coin platform with confidence. In a volatile industry, we are a beacon of stability. We are bullish on the potential of this industry. We see significant market growth from here over the next 10 years. We believe we are in the best position in the industry to unite the very best operators and support their growth. Our goal is to listen to our operators and deliver the very best products and features to them so they can deliver maximum value to their customers at scale,\" concluded Barnard.\n\nAbout Genesis Coin: Genesis Coin is the first and largest white-label Bitcoin ATM network worldwide.

        "content": "Blockchain infrastructure firm Blockstream Corporation Inc. on Tuesday said it raised US$125 million from convertible note and secured loan financing to expand its Bitcoin mining operations and meet strong demand for what it called \u201cinstitutional hosting services.\u201d Kingsway Capital led the convertible note, a form of short-term debt that can convert to equity, joined by other investors including Fulgar Ventures.\n\nSee related article: Binance\u2019s BUSD-peg stablecoin has not always been fully collateralized: report\n\nFast facts\n\nBlockstream completed a US$210 million Series B fundraiser in August 2021 that was used to build several mining facilities, and the latest fundraise will help the company \u201ccontinue to build infrastructure for the future Bitcoin economy,\u201d said Blockstream president and chief financial officer, Erik Svenson, in a statement.\n\nThe company said providing hosting services for miners has remained a resilient market segment, less directly exposed to bitcoin price volatility and narrower profit margins. Blockstream also said it will expand its renewable energy mining products, and continue developing its own bitcoin miner.\n\nBitcoin mining is a process where miners compete to validate transactions on the blockchain by solving complex cryptographic equations and to be compensated with Bitcoin.\n\nProfit margins at miners have been compressed by the 65% drop in Bitcoin prices from the record high of US$68,789 in November 2021.\n\nThese pressures were compounded last week when the Bitcoin mining difficulty rate, which determines how much computing power is required to verify blocks on the blockchain, reached an all-time high of 37.59 trillion. This spike was due to many U.S.-based miners coming back online after a severe winter storm disrupted power supply and forced many to suspend operations.\n\nCore Scientific, one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining firms in the U.S., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the state of Texas in late December as it was unable to repay debt financing for equipment leasing.\n\nBitcoin prices have rebounded more than 35% since the start of the year and traded at US$22,648 at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong.\n\nSee related article: Binance stablecoin conversion controversial, but what does it mean for users?"

        "content": "A key feature of the Bitcoin blockchain network (and all blockchains, for that matter) is that it is a public digital ledger, and all transaction data is publicly available. This allows Bitcoin to be fully decentralised.\n\nThe downside of this transparency, however, is that anyone can access and extract transaction data from the network. While there are internal protocols and privacy measures in place, as well as techniques like coin mixing that one could use to conceal transaction data, they aren't solid enough to prevent someone from acquiring and publishing it. One reason for implementing Taproot was to enhance the privacy and security of sensitive user data by allowing only essential transaction data to remain public.\n\n\n\nSpeed and performance were other issues with the Bitcoin network that Taproot aims to solve. The cryptographic signature technology that was used to record keys and signatures of transactions before Taproot had a longer commit time and took up more space on the network. The new Bitcoin Taproot signature (called Schnorr signature technology) aims to enhance speed and performance."

        "content": "Ether\u2019s (ETH) rally versus Bitcoin (BTC) is not only showing signs of exhaustion but is also in danger of breaking below a key technical support level.\n\nETH slides vs. BTC in the second half of January\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair declined nearly 9.25% on Jan. 24 from its local top of 0.0779 BTC established on Jan. 11. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin has been slightly outpacing Ether in terms of United States dollars, rising 38% versus 35%, respectively.\n\nETH/BTC daily candle price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInterestingly, Ether\u2019s pullback versus Bitcoin has landed its price at the bottom of its EMA ribbon range, as shown below.\n\nETH/BTC weekly candle price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe EMA ribbon indicator shows numerous exponential moving averages of increasing timeframe on the same price chart. Dropping below the ribbon range increases an asset\u2019s likelihood of seeing an extended down-move.\n\nIn other words, breaking lower would increase its possibility of declining by more than 20% from its current price levels.\n\nConversely, rising above the ribbon range raises the asset\u2019s chances of a broader rally.\n\nEther\u2019s price capped by key descending trendline\n\nThis week, ETH/BTC dropped to the 55-week exponential moving average (the red wave) \u2014 a bottom wave \u2014 of its EMA ribbon indicator, as shown below. Buyers took control near the 55-week EMA, prompting Ether to recover a mere 0.35% versus Bitcoin to 0.0708 BTC on Jan. 24.\n\nRelated: This $25K BTC price target would spell misery for Bitcoin shorters\n\nBut now, the likelihood of retesting the EMA ribbon bottom is high due to a multi-month descending trendline resistance (black trendline in the chart below), where sellers have been more active as of late.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart focusing on descending trendline resistance. Source: TradingView\n\nTherefore, one cannot rule out the possibility of ETH/BTC breaking below the EMA ribbon range, similar to how the pair did in May 2022 in the wake of the Terra collapse.\n\nBack then, Ether fell by over 25% versus Bitcoin to 0.0490, a level coinciding with its 200-week EMA (the blue wave).\n\nTherefore, if a similar breakdown occurs in the coming weeks, the ETH/BTC pair may test the 200-week EMA near 0.0550 BTC as its primary downside target, or roughly a 20% price drop from current levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Listen-to-earn aims to do something similar for podcasters, creating a direct link between podcasters and their audience and letting listeners earn Bitcoin for every minute they tune in.\n\nInstead of an expensive and sweeping ad campaign, the listen-to-earn model aims to only spend money on listeners who actually want to listen.\n\n\u201cWhen money moves as seamlessly as information, or in this case, audio, it just opens up a world of possibilities, and we\u2019re happy to be pioneering what that means in the podcasting space alongside Fountain,\u201d Cousens said.\n\nFountain, ZEBEDEE and \u2018listen-to-earn\u2019\n\nFountain launched its listen-to-earn program in June 2022.\n\nThe program allows listeners and podcasters to get rewarded for the value they provide. Fountain users will earn money for their first hour of daily podcast listening.\n\nTo draw in listeners, the platform uses RSS feeds to make podcasts from other platforms available to its listeners. Using the Fountain app to listen to their favorite podcast, users earn small amounts of Bitcoin, called sats or satoshis, after the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen the user is ready to cash out, they connect to the ZEBEDEE app to withdraw.\n\n\u201cThis type of Value for Value exchange is the future of content creation,\u201d Fountain\u2019s founder and CEO Oscar Merry said in a press release.\n\n\u201cA few years from now, we\u2019ll look back at when we paid subscriptions for content platforms that aren\u2019t related to how much we actually use those platforms and laugh at how basic and inefficient it was,\u201d he said."

        "content": "At the crypto finance service provider, a refocus on the core business results in a reshuffling of management. There are also two departures to report.\n\nBitcoin Suisse is changing its management structure in three areas. Sven Ramspott takes over as chief financial officer (CFO), adding to his current risk officer responsibilities. Pierre-Alain Krohn takes over as head of compliance, and Michael Gauckler, currently head of innovation, will be appointed responsible for products.\n\nThe appointments are related to the reorganization of Switzerland's largest crypto broker, which accompanies a reduction in staff, according to a statement Wednesday. In an interview with finews.com in November, CEO Dirk Klee hinted at such measures.\n\nThe austerity measure is justified by the stock market slump hitting traditional financial and crypto markets simultaneously and lasting longer than expected. Still, the layoffs are well below the average currently seen in the crypto industry.\n\nThree Chiefs in New Roles\n\nRamspott, with over 25 years of experience in leadership roles in the financial industry, joined Bitcoin Suisse in September 2021. In his previous role as chief risk officer and head of risk & compliance, he developed frameworks for compliance and, in particular, anti-money. In doing so, he laid a key foundation for the strategic direction of Bitcoin Suisse, according to the statement.\n\nKrohn spent five years in a leadership role at JP Morgan in Geneva, where he was responsible for anti-money laundering, governance, and controls, before joining Bitcoin Suisse.\n\nGauckler joined Bitcoin Suisse as head of product development & innovation in September 2020. He has 20 years of experience, including as co-founder of Evolute Group, and at Credit Suisse and PwC.\n\nDepartures\n\nWith a refocusing on core markets, there will also be two departures. Mauro Casellini, CEO of Bitcoin Suisse Liechtenstein, is taking on a new challenge. The Liechtenstein, Denmark, and Bratislava locations now fall under the aegis of Chief Operating Officer Peter Camenzind, according to reports.\n\nCurrent CFO Philipp Vonmoos hands over his responsibility to Ramspott at the beginning of February. Vonmoos joined the company in 2017, first leading the custody business and then the finance division. Most recently, he supported the introduction of the new crypto-compatible core banking system.\n\nAccording to Chairman Luzius Meisser, Bitcoin Suisse intends to continue its growth in the institutional sector despite the significant market corrections of the past year."

The crypto market has, at least, paused after rallying since the beginning of the year.\n\nTotal capitalisation is down 2.9% over the last 24 hours but remains just above $1 trillion. Among the top altcoins, Ethereum loses 4.9%, while the rest are down between 2.9% (Litecoin) and 6% (Solana).\n\nIn Bitcoin, today's lows at $22.3K are part of a typical correction from the momentum of last week's lows. A break below $22.2K suggests a deeper correction to the $20.5-21.0K area.\n\nNews Background\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, the cryptocurrency market will enter a new phase in 2023.\n\nThe mindset of long-term investors will determine whether the current wave of bitcoin growth is a bull trap or a strategic buying opportunity, Glassnode believes.\n\nFor the first cryptocurrency to continue its rally, it will need to overcome a key resistance level at $25,000, according to cryptocurrency firm B2C2. Once this milestone is passed, there will be renewed interest from \"outsiders\" looking to get back into the market.\n\nBernstein said that the rally is unlikely to continue as there are no signs of \"new injections\" of funds into the crypto market.\n\nEuropean Parliament lawmakers voted that Banks holding cryptocurrencies in the EU will have to comply with stricter capital requirements for digital assets.\n\nThis article was written by FxPro\u2019s Senior Market Analyst Alex Kuptsikevich."

An upward trend in OBV suggests that the volume of buying is greater than the volume of selling, which is typically a bullish signal for the asset\u2019s price.\n\nFurther, the dynamic line (green) of the leading coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) rested above the center line at a positive 0.30 at press time. A rising positive CMF above the zero line is a sign of strength in the market.\n\nThe strength of the bullish trend in the BTC current market was confirmed by the position of the Average Directional Index (ADX). As of this writing, the ADX (yellow) was 51.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s ADX is above 25, this indicates that the current market trend is strong. With an ADX of 51, the buyers\u2019 strength might become irrevocable by BTC sellers in the short term.\n\nLastly, BTC\u2019s Open Interest has been on a rally since the year started, data from CoinGlass revealed. At $11.13 billion at press time, BTC\u2019s Open Interest has risen by 21% since 1 January. A rising Open Interest is an indication of growing bullish sentiment, which further drives the growth of an asset\u2019s price."

        "content": "Despite the bear market and the record-low dynamics of new Bitcoin ATM installations around the world, Australia has broken into the top three nations globally by the number of crypto ATMs. It was only in the first days of January when the Aussies got to the fourth spot \u2014 since that time 16 more machines have been installed.\n\nAccording to Coinatmradar\u2019s data, Australia now enjoys 234 crypto ATMs, which puts the country in the third spot globally after the United States and Canada. In three weeks it outperformed Spain, which possesses 222 crypto ATMs.\n\nIt\u2019s all about dynamics \u2014 Australia deployed 99 crypto ATMs, which is almost half of its total number, in just the last three months of 2022. And since Jan. 1, Australia has installed 16 new machines, while Spain has actually lost four and El Salvador, which holds the fifth global spot, hasn\u2019t recorded a single new ATM.\n\nCrypto ATM distribution by continents and countries. Source: CoinATMRadar\n\nOverall, Australia\u2019s numbers, as well as Spain\u2019s and El Salvador\u2019s, could hardly match the enormous proportion of crypto ATMs in the U.S. The States is home to 33,387 crypto ATMs \u201486.9% of all the machines in the world. Together with Canada, which has 2,556, the two nations possess a stunning 94.4% of all crypto ATMs.\n\nRelated: How to buy Bitcoin in Australia?\n\nA year-long bear market in 2022, accompanied by geopolitical tensions and global inflation, resulted in a dramatic slowing down of the crypto ATM installations. Only 94 Bitcoin ATMs were added between July to the end of 2022 to the global network, in contrast to 4,169 ATMs during the first half of 2022.\n\nIn January, the Australian city of Coolangatta got its first Bitcoin ATM with integrated Lightning Network capabilities. It works similarly to traditional crypto ATMs but saves significant time due to the layer 2 Lightning solution, and also allows for purchasing very small amounts of BTC."

Play-to-earn gaming, along with earning from music streaming, has been the forerunner for this type of crypto integration.\n\nOn Jan 24. Fountain, a value-for-value podcasting platform, announced a new partnership with ZEBEDEE, a financial services company that helps monetize games and apps, to enable Bitcoin (BTC) micropayments for podcast listeners.\n\nOscar Merry, the founder and CEO of Fountain, called the ability to listen to a podcast and earn money for it, a powerful combo and the future of content creation.\n\n\u201cA few years from now, we\u2019ll look back at paid subscriptions for content platforms that aren\u2019t related to how much we actually use those platforms and laugh at how basic and inefficient it was. \u201d\n\nAdditionally, through the partnership with ZEBEDEE, users don\u2019t need to know anything about cryptocurrencies to take advantage of the rewards through debit and credit card integrations.\n\nThe CEO told Cointelegraph that through the use of the Bitcoin Lightning Network specifically, instant, permissionless, and low-fee payments can be programmed that work both within the Fountain app and other open RSS standards.\n\nRelated: Ushering in a new era of Web3 gaming by making Play-to-Earn sustainable\n\nAccording to Merry, such a development connects a \u201cfragmented podcasting industry\u201d which currently operates across numerous unsynchronized apps and hosting providers.\n\nHe went on to highlight that every minute spent viewing ads and consuming or creating content increases a platform\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn't you participate in the financial upside of the value you create on the platform?\u201d\n\nAs developers continue to prioritize utility in new protocols, adoption of emerging technologies becomes almost unnoticeable.

In it, the company says Ver owes the company $20,869,788 for \u201cfailure to settle cryptocurrency options transactions\u201d that expired on December 30.\n\nThe Digital Currency Group broker and lending desk filed for bankruptcy on January 20, revealing in court documents that it has more than $150 million to fund its restructuring efforts.\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Ver was involved in a similar spat with CoinFLEX last year.

It was a common refrain from companies at the time, who were dealing with the fallout from multiple bankruptcies.\n\nBut CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb claimed on Twitter that Ver owes the company $47 million and said he\u2019d already been issued a default notice for failure to pay up.\n\nVer called the claim \u201cblatantly false,\u201d adding that CoinFLEX owed him money, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cNot only do I not have a debt to this counter-party, but this counter-party owes me a substantial sum of money, and I am currently seeking the return of my funds,\u201d he wrote on Twitter."

Can this lead to a $25,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and beyond, or will some unforeseen event ruin the party? Tune in to find out.\n\nWe start off this week\u2019s show with the latest news in the markets:\n\nStablecoin data points to \u2018healthy appetite\u2019 from bulls and possible Bitcoin rally to $25K\n\nBitcoin rallied 11% between Jan. 20 and Jan. 21, reaching the $23,000 level and shattering bears\u2019 expectations for a pullback to $20,000. Even more notable is that the move brought demand from Asia-based retail investors, according to data from a key stablecoin premium indicator. Another bit of bullish information came on Jan. 20 after United States Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller reinforced the market expectation of a 25 basis point interest rate increase in February. Do these and other odds favor a rally toward $24,000 or maybe even $25,000?\n\nSEC commissioner reminds of \u2018the point of crypto\u2019 as market aims for recovery\n\nHester Peirce, a commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said that after a terrible year, industry players need to remember what crypto is really about. In a speech at the Digital Assets at Duke conference, Peirce laid down some lessons to be learned from the issues that the crypto industry had to face last year. According to the commissioner, 2022 was a \u201cterrible, horrible, no good, very bad year\u201d for both the crypto space and regulators.

To find out what she thinks crypto is really about, make sure to tune in to the live show.\n\nBitcoin price stays near $23K as data shows hodlers not selling BTC\n\nWith BTC up 40% in January, a further point of concern focused on the temptation to take profits.

In 2019, it announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies at certain store locations via the Flexa app.\n\nThis move enabled customers to use their digital assets to purchase groceries at Whole Foods, expanding the use cases for cryptocurrency beyond speculative investments.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles, renewable energy, and energy storage. In 2021, it announced that it would begin accepting payments in Bitcoin for its products.\n\nThis move positions Tesla as one of the first major companies to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, and it could potentially lead to more widespread adoption of cryptocurrency in the retail industry.\n\nRakuten\n\nRakuten is a Japanese e-commerce giant that accepts multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple.\n\nIt is one of the most famous online retailers in Japan, and accepting cryptocurrency enables it to cater to the growing number of cryptocurrency holders in Japan and around the world. It also helps Rakuten to be at the forefront of innovation and technology.\n\nNewegg\n\nNewegg is an online retailer that specializes in computer hardware and consumer electronics. In August 2014, Newegg announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment on its website.\n\nNewegg accepts Bitcoin through a partnership with BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor.\n\nWhy are retailers accepting cryptocurrency?\n\nThere are several reasons why retailers are beginning to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.\n\nFirst, cryptocurrency offers a fast, secure, and decentralized method of payment. Transactions made with cryptocurrency are processed almost instantly and are secure due to the use of cryptography.\n\nSecond, cryptocurrency can help retailers reach a wider audience. As more and more people begin to use and invest in cryptocurrency, retailers who accept it as a form of payment can tap into this growing market.\n\nThird, accepting cryptocurrency can help retailers save on transaction fees. Traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, often come with high transaction fees. In contrast, many cryptocurrency payment processors charge lower fees.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, more retailers are beginning to accept it as a form of payment. Overstock.com, Expedia, Microsoft, Dell, and Newegg are among the well known retailers that now accept payments in cryptocurrency.\n\nRetailers are accepting cryptocurrency because it offers a fast, secure, and decentralised method of payment that can help them reach a wider audience and can help them save on transaction fees.\n\nAs more retailers begin to accept cryptocurrency, it is likely that we will see even more widespread adoption of this digital currency."

        "title": "Bitcoin Bull Run? Is it time to Invest - Cryptocurrency - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As you probably know, crypto markets went through the most challenging year in 2022. The problems started with Terra Luna\u2019s downfall, followed by worldwide economic issues, rising interest rates, and increasing energy bills. Then, when it looked like the markets would recover, the FTX scandal increased fear, forcing even more investors out of the markets.\n\n2023 will likely be the make-or-break year for the industry, and judging from the first weeks of January, crypto markets could also recover and reach new all-time highs. The top-ranked crypto, Bitcoin, experienced a 23% growth since January 7, signaling a potential bull run for the entire market. So, let\u2019s see what\u2019s behind the recent Bitcoin price rally and why cryptos like MEMAG, FGHT, CCHG, RIA, and D2T are safer investments.\n\nCan Bitcoin Recover in 2023?\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the entire economic system is standing on shaky legs. The last three years have put enormous strain on the global economy. Even though central banks and governments are doing everything they can to slow down inflation, almost everyone agrees that a recession will be inevitable in 2023. Of course, a global recession is the last thing crypto markets need right now, but the fear factor is dropping despite the rising uncertainty. As a result, 2023 will likely be a year of caution among crypto investors, and most experts don\u2019t expect a crypto bull run by the end of the year.\n\nThat said, traders are already focusing their strategies on 2024. While Bitcoin is unlikely to hit previous all-time highs of $69k in 2023, the crypto has bottomed out. In other words, most experts agree that the crypto markets will enter a recovery period. The recent Bitcoin price increase is a welcomed change compared to the previous six months, but most institutional investors still choose to watch the markets from the sidelines.\n\nThe good news is that most indicators are showing positive signs of recovery, but investors are still waiting for a rally. But, of course, the same approach stands for most successful cryptos, and if things stabilize, the markets could enter a whole new era of hypergrowth. So, let\u2019s see what the experts predict about Bitcoin\u2019s price changes in the next few years.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\n2023 could turn out to be one of the most volatile years for the crypto markets on record. Future Bitcoin price predictions are widely different between financial and crypto experts. Some think the world\u2019s highest-ranked crypto could bottom out at $5,000, while others believe the only way from here is up. Here is a quick overview of the most likely turn of events by 2035.\n\nAfter analyzing various technical indicators, social sentiment, and other KPIs, Bitcoin bottomed out in late 2022, and current price predictions for 2023 put the average price at $29,677. The climb won\u2019t be as sharp as before due to the worldwide financial situation, but the token is still expected to grow steadily.\n\n2024 should be much more exciting for all Bitcoin holders. The year could end with prices as high as $45,000, which is an impressive price spike compared to right now. The trend will continue in 2025, as most experts put their predictions between $61,125 and $80,212. That said, Bitcoin depends on many factors, and since the markets are more volatile than ever, investors are still on the sidelines. Instead, many moved their funds into emerging crypto projects with high token utilization and excellent tokenomics. Let\u2019s see which ones are the highest rated.\n\nTop Crypto Investment Options in 2023\n\nWhile many existing cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, still have a long way to go to recover, a few upcoming crypto projects have attracted impressive investments in the past few weeks. We selected a few of the most popular investment options below to ensure you take advantage of your chance to invest in crypto with high return potential.\n\nMeta Masters Guild (MEMAG) \u2013 First Ever Mobile Game Crypto Project\n\nMeta Masters Guild is the first platform focused on web3 gaming designed for mobile devices. It aims to introduce blockchain\u2019s decentralized features into mobile gaming, providing users with multiple high-end games to play and earn valuable rewards. Players will be compensated for upgrading their characters, completing challenges, and more.\n\nThe platform will launch with three games: Meta Karts, Meta Masters World, and Raid NFTs. Each game belongs to a different genre, and all of them are incredibly well-designed and super-fun to play. These games are a breath of fresh air in the otherwise generic mobile game industry, and the blockchain features will introduce new systems that could revolutionize mobile gaming.\n\nThe ecosystem has two currencies. The first one is called GEMS, and it\u2019s used only for in-game purchases, upgrades, etc. The second main currency is called MEMAG. Players can exchange their GEMS for MEMAG tokens they can sell on the market after the first CEX/DEX listings.\n\nThe official Meta Masters Guild MEMAG token presale is open right now, so you can invest early and enjoy the highest returns in the future. The platform will be available by the end of 2023, and if you invest now, you will get some impressive gains in a few months.\n\n>>>Buy MEMAG Now<<<\n\nFight Out (FGHT) \u2013 Move to Earn Fitness App With High Rewards\n\nFight Out is another perspective crypto project with an excellent idea and even better execution. It\u2019s one of the hottest new crypto projects on the market, and it keeps popping up on the \u2018best cryptos to invest in\u2019 lists all over the internet. Fight Out is a health and fitness app that rewards active users with valuable in-game tokens. In a way, it\u2019s similar to STEPN, but it offers more exercise options and higher rewards.\n\nAfter downloading the app on your smartphone, you must get a pair of virtual training sneakers. Each pair has its own stats and is designed for a specific use. The app will ask basic questions to understand your exercise preferences better and run a few tests to calculate your fitness levels. You can then start training, jogging, running, going to the gym, or completing any other physical exercise, and you will get in-game tokens called REPS.\n\nREPS are used for all in-app purchases, but you can exchange them for native FGHT tokens. FGHT coins act as the platform\u2019s utility, and since Fight Out has such a fantastic design and huge appeal, they will increase in value over time. FGHT tokens are currently available in presale. The platform has raised over $3 million in a couple of weeks, so take advantage of your chance to invest in one of the best fitness apps on the market early and get huge returns in the future.\n\n>>>Buy Fight Out Now<<<\n\nC+ Charge (CCHG) \u2013 Revolutionary Crypto Platform For Electric Vehicles Owners\n\nElectric vehicles, or EVs, are the future. The developed world wants to remove all combustion engine vehicles from the roads around the world before 2050, which makes C+ Charge such an excellent investment option. It\u2019s a brand-new crypto project designed to cater to EV owners by allowing them to earn carbon credits when charging their vehicles at charging stations across the globe.\n\nOf course, users can track their carbon footprints and exchange carbon credits they earn for native CCHG tokens that can be used to pay for charging expenses at stations anywhere. That will allow users to track their expenses in real time and bypass expensive home charging stations. Namely, users who generate enough tokens can use their C+ Charge app to order charging stations and install them on their properties. That way, they can use the CCHG tokens to pay for every charge they make in the future.\n\nThe word about C+ Charge is spreading like wildfire.

However, no matter how good a game might be, it doesn\u2019t have advanced blockchain features like total transparency, full ownership of digital cards, and much more. That\u2019s where Calvaria: Duels of Eternity jumps in. It not only offers all of the above but also promises an exciting trading card experience with a chance to earn in-game tokens.\n\nCalvaria has two versions of the game. One is a blockchain version, while the other is a classic mobile game without play-to-earn features, and its only goal is to motivate players to adopt blockchain technologies. Once you start playing, you can begin earning in-game eRIA tokens every time you win a tournament or complete a challenge. Players can use the tokens they earn to upgrade card decks, unlock bonuses and extra features, and much more.\n\nAfter the official launch, they can also exchange eRIA coins for RIA tokens that will be available on all major CEX/DEX listing. That means that players get complete control of their earnings, which allows them to sell or exchange RIA tokens for other cryptos at any time. The official RIA token presale is open now, so you can join the earliest investors to get the highest returns.\n\n>>>Buy Calvaria Now<<<\n\nDash 2 Trade (D2T) \u2013 Unique Crypto Signals And Analytics Trading Platform\n\nLastly, we have Dash 2 Trade, a new crypto signals and analytics platform with perfect timing.

Since it\u2019s designed to simplify trading and present all essential data from a single dashboard, Dash 2 Trade is just what traders need to cope with increasingly complex markets. In addition, dash 2 Trade is designed by the team behind Learn 2 Trade, a platform with an 80,000-strong community and a spotless record.\n\nThe project reached its first CEX on Gate.io on January 11, with many more listings planned for the near future. Dash 2 Trade had a hugely successful presale that ended months ahead of schedule. So the devs decided to unroll one feature at a time, starting with the already available Dashboard. Dash 2 Trade is the best choice you can make if you want to get the most out of every trade, so get some D2T tokens and use them to purchase a paid subscription with all advanced features unlocked.\n\n>>>Buy Dash 2 Trade Now<<<\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThe future of crypto markets is still uncertain, but judging from the current price movements, it\u2019s steadily recovering. Bitcoin is still the most valuable crypto out there, and despite the significant price boost in the past week, it will probably take years until it reaches previous all-time highs. However, if you want to invest in cryptos with high growth potential, the ones mentioned above are your safest options. Invest today, and you could get some jaw-dropping returns in the near future.

        "content": "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon bashes Bitcoin (again, yawn)\n\nMore than 50 heads of state and government, as well as business, financial, economic, media, academic and civic leaders from around the world last week headed to Davos, the Swiss mountain resort, for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF).\n\nAmongst the familiar faces at the four-day conference was the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, which with US$3.774 trillion in total assets, is the fifth-largest banking institution in the world.\n\nOnce again Jamie Dimon took the opportunity to bash Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in an interview, \u201cBitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud. It\u2019s a pet rock.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think all that\u2019s been a waste of time and why you guys waste any breath on it is totally beyond me.\u201d\n\nCNBC anchor Joe Kernen fought back against Dimon\u2019s outburst, insisting that Bitcoin is a \u201cstore of value,\u201d that is \u201cimmutable\u201d and \u201cscarce,\u201d noting its protocol demands that there will only ever be 21 million coins.\n\nUnfortunately, the claims made by the influential Wall Street boss were hardly surprising. He has a history of publicly slamming crypto.\n\nIn 2014, he opined: \u201cVirtual currency, where it\u2019s called a Bitcoin vs a US dollar, that\u2019s going to be stopped.\u201d\n\nIn September 2017, Dimon launched possibly his most outrageous attack, threatening to fire traders who bought cryptocurrency.\n\nSoon after, he followed up his cynicism with, \u201cIf you\u2019re stupid enough to buy it, you\u2019ll pay the price for it one day\u201d.\n\nWhat IS surprising, however, is that despite his antagonistic attitude towards crypto, the bank is moving to the crypto space.\n\nFor example, it has created its own digital coin, allows its wealth management clients to buy into Bitcoin and Ethereum, and recently posted openings for digital assets counsel positions with its corporate and investment bank.\n\nA direct question: Which is it then, Mr Dimon? Do you think a) digital, global, borderless, tamper-proof, unconfiscatable currencies are likely to be part of the future of finance in our increasingly tech-driven world? Or b) your wealth management clients who decide to invest in crypto are participating in a \u2013 in your words \u2013 \u201cdecentralised Ponzi scheme?\u201d\n\nI assume it is the former and that JPMorgan, like many other major legacy financial institutions, including Fidelity, BlackRock and New York Bank Mellon, are offering crypto-related services in order to potentially benefit their clients.\n\nAs digital currencies are increasingly being regarded by Wall Street giants, household name investing legends, leading academic institutions, major multinational corporations, and even whole governments and sovereign funds, as the future of money, Jamie Dimon\u2019s continued dismissal of crypto is somewhat bizarre and baffling.\n\nMy best guess as to why he maintains this approach is that he supports the concept of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which would face competition from crypto.\n\nDespite Dimon\u2019s best efforts in Davos, Bitcoin\u2019s price has jumped more than 25% in the past few weeks alone."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2023 sustained rally has emerged at a period market conditions are still dominated by uncertainty stemming from last year\u2019s bear environment. With Bitcoin rallying by almost 40% since the start of the year, investors are still looking for hints likely to dictate the next price movement.\n\nAs the maiden crypto faces resistance at $23,000, TradingShot, a pseudonymous analyst on TradingView observed that Bitcoin is staring at the dreaded death cross. In particular, the digital asset is approaching the first-ever one-week death cross in history, a scenario that could invalidate the ongoing bullish trendline.\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable, and it will be formed in the next or 2 weeks maximum. Being a technically bearish formation, will it affect the price negatively and restore the bearish trend long-term?\u201d the analyst posed.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin\u2019s previous attempts to hit death cross\n\nIt is worth noting a death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend. Therefore, TradingShot observed that historically, every time Bitcoin surged by over 50% after hitting the one-week 200-day moving average, it represented a BTC price bottom apart from the January to March 2015 rise. Indeed, Bitcoin is up by about 50% from the November 2022 lows.\n\nConsequently, in a tweet on January 24, crypto trader and analyst by the pseudonym Thescalpingpro noted that Bitcoin\u2019s current movement resembles the 2015 price pump that saw BTC rally 214%. Interestingly, the rally emerged just before a death cross was about to be realized.\n\nBitcoin 2015 and 2023 rally comparison. Source: Thescalpingpro\n\nFurthermore, as Bitcoin faces a possible death cross, another crypto expert by the Twitter username Steve Courtney stated if Bitcoin realizes the one-week death cross, indicators point to a possible one-day golden cross before.\n\nBitcoin death cross and golden cross chart. Source: Steve Courtney\n\nNotably, the death cross technical indicator is a significant shift in the market and could signal a prolonged period of decline for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough the death cross comes with a bearish sentiment, it is sometimes welcomed by a section of the market as it offers an opportunity to purchase the asset at discounted prices.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin\u2019s momentum toward $23,000 appears to have cooled down with minor corrections. The asset is valued at $22,599 with 24 hours losses of over 1%.\n\nBitcoin one-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nFrom the technical analysis perspective, the daily summary of the one-day gauges aligns with \u2018buy\u2019 at 15, while moving averages are for a \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 13. Oscillators are neutral at 7.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the meantime, the focus turns to Bitcoin\u2019s support level of $22,500.

        "content": "After surging past $22,000, Bitcoin (BTC) is looking to reclaim new levels and sustain the current bull run. Although Bitcoin has largely traded in the green zone since the start of the year, it remains to be seen if the maiden crypto can extend its gains or if the bull run will be invalidated.\n\nThe uncertainty around Bitcoin stems from the fact that the crypto sector has yet to fully recover from the prevailing factors that dominated last year\u2019s bear market. However, Bitcoincenter\u2019s rainbow price chart suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s current bull run may be just beginning, and investors could see the price of BTC continue to rise in the coming months.\n\nAs of January 25, the Bitcoin rainbow chart indicates that BTC is in the \u2018Buy\u2019 zone after previously consolidating in the \u2018Basically a Fire Sale\u2019 area. Notably, the trajectory mirrors a historical trend last observed in March 2020 amid the onset of the pandemic.\n\nBitcoin Rainbow chart. Source: BlockchainCenter\n\nNotably, investors use the tool to monitor the possible Bitcoin price movement in the future. The indicator deploys color bands that follow a logarithmic regression and reviews historical Bitcoin price performance to provide a potential insight into its long-term movements.\n\nBitcoin was trading below $6,000 when it exited the \u2018Basically a Fire Sale\u2019 in March 2020. The exit triggered a Bitcoin price bottom that pushed the asset to rally toward the 2021 bull run, culminating in BTC hitting an all-time high of almost $69,000.\n\nBitcoin bearish indicators\n\nEven as the rainbow indicator points to a bullish Bitcoin future, a previous report indicated that the largest crypto by market capitalization\u2019s ongoing rally could face a correction. Specifically, Bitcoin technical analysis suggests the asset could face a potential first-ever death cross scenario that spells bearish fortunes for the crypto.\n\nAt the same time, as reported by Finbold, a panel of fintech and crypto specialists maintains that Bitcoin\u2019s value is poised to increase in 2023. The 56 specialists projected that Bitcoin might peak at around $29,095 in 2023 and finish the year at $26,844.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin is still attempting to reclaim the $23,000 as the position continues to act as a key resistance level. The asset is currently changing hands at $22,706 with weekly gains of almost 7%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

        "content": "As technology and the cryptocurrency industry progress, new options become available to earn digital assets, including generating Bitcoin (BTC) by playing video games, and one developer has upgraded his vintage Nintendo console to generate the decentralized finance (DeFi) asset while playing Super Mario.\n\nSpecifically, Christian Moss, developer and co-founder at Zebedee (ZBD), a Bitcoin-powered platform that allows developers to put money in their games and gamers to earn money by playing them, has upgraded his original Nintendo to do just this, as he demonstrated in a video posted on January 23.\n\nWith @zebedeeio you can put bitcoin into anything!\n\nIn preparation for @advbitcoin I wanted to see if I could add bitcoin into a Super Mario running on my original NES, every time you get a coin it sends you some sats! pic.twitter.com/KPIvO09oo7 \u2014 Christian Moss (@MandelDuck) January 23, 2023\n\nHow it went\n\nAs Moss started playing Super Mario Bros. 3 on his Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) upgraded via Zebedee, the game sent him 10 satoshis or \u2018sats\u2019 (the atomic unit of Bitcoin) each time he scored a coin in the game, as evidenced in the split-screen video of the game and his phone payment notifications.\n\nTaking into account that 100 million satoshis equal one Bitcoin (10 sats = 0.0000001 BTC or $0.002299 at press time), this would be a slow, albeit very fun, way to generate a profitable amount of the maiden digital asset, especially if the game is among one\u2019s favorites.\n\nIn the comments to the video, Moss gave a tip to a fellow Bitcoin Gameboy game developer on how to implement the system, stressing that, if the game can do basic HTTP requests, then it would be easy to send sats with the Zebedee API.\n\nThe developer also said he would be presenting his project at the Bitcoin-exclusive conference Advancing Bitcoin, which is set to take place on March 2-3 in London, promising to write a detailed tutorial for anyone interested in repeating his experiment.\n\nSimilar endeavors\n\nInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time someone has enabled a video game console to earn cryptocurrency. In late March 2021, Finbold reported on a pseudonymous vlogger who modded his Nintendo Game Boy to enable it to mine Bitcoin, after failing to find an appropriate graphics processing unit (GPU) in stores.\n\nHis solution was to connect the Game Boy to a computer using Raspberry Pi Pico through the console\u2019s link port, normally used to perform Pok\u00e9mon trading and other things. The Raspberry Pi Pico allowed him to build an adapter from a link cable to USB. That said, the game console could only pump out 0.8 hashes per second."
