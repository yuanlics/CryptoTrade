        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices rose broadly on Monday, with bitcoin climbing above $27,000 for the first time this month.\n\nBitcoin was last higher by less than 1% at $26,685.97, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier it rose as much as almost 4% to $27,403.17. Ether was slightly higher also and trading at $1,635.90.\n\nThe reason for the move wasn't clear, although there was a spike in trading volume during opening hours in the Asian market, said Dessislava Aubert, senior research analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko.\n\n\"In the current low liquidity environment, relatively low buying and selling pressure could amplify spot price movements and spur liquidations on derivatives markets,\" she said."

        "title": "20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this article, we will be talking about the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most. We will also discuss the recent trends in the crypto market along with the major players in the industry. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most.\n\nWill Bitcoin Grow to an All-Time High by 2024?\n\nOn September 7, Forbes analyzed what the future holds for Bitcoin. According to the report, Bitcoin has witnessed significant price improvements in 2023. After a rough period for the crypto market in 2022, Bitcoin reported a strong comeback in 2023. In July, Bitcoin climbed to $31,000. While the price for one Bitcoin slightly deteriorated to $25,956 on September 13, experts expect a recovery soon. According to the report, Bitcoin seems to be under inflationary pressure. Inflationary pressures forced the Fed to raise interest rates. Such has contributed to a major resistance in the trade of Bitcoin at the price of $28,900. The report informs readers that, as per the Indian government, all transactions of digital assets would be regulated by the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). While crypto laws are necessary, stringent regulations may limit the growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDespite the turmoil surrounding the current status of Bitcoin, the reports hint at 2024 being a game-changer for the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin halving event is expected in 2024, which brings the hope of a boost in the price of Bitcoin. The halving event takes place every four years. During the halving event, the price reward to Bitcoin miners is cut by 50%. Such helps contract the supply and is a positive sign for Bitcoin's price.\n\nUncertainty and volatility surrounding Bitcoin have been a common trend this year. Stringent regulations in countries and a worsening global macroeconomic condition limit the ability of experts to predict the future of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, experts hold high expectations for the coming year. Take a look at the most valuable currencies in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Do the New Crypto Regulations Mean?\n\nThe United States is home to one of the most crypto owners. However, this does not exclude the American market from the wrath of uncertainty and volatility of currencies. On August 25, Reuters reported new crypto regulations introduced by the Biden administration. According to the new tax reporting rules, crypto brokers must report sales and exchanges of all digital assets to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The new tax reporting regulations were primarily aimed at countering tax evasion. On the bright side, the new tax regulation makes processing easier for regular crypto taxpayers. The regulation aligns with the administration's efforts to bring in more money from taxes. With the new bill in action, the estimated tax revenue for the next decade is almost $28 billion. To shed light on the importance of tax regulations for the future of the economy, the treasury reported:\n\n\"This is part of a broader effort at Treasury to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules.\"\n\nWhile regulation is a prerequisite for the mass acceptance of crypto or Bitcoin as a mainstream payment method, stringent laws may limit user's willingness to invest in cryptocurrencies. The impact of the new tax regulations can only be judged in the coming months.\n\nAre Large Corporations Withdrawing Interest in Crypto?\n\nAre large companies with significant stakes in the crypto market distancing themselves from the crypto industry? Is this because of stringent laws or the falling prices of Bitcoin?\n\nOn August 25, CNBC reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently ended its partnership with Binance. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) will not offer branded Binance cards in Latin America and the Middle East anymore. Users used these cards to purchase commodities directly with their crypto assets. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) also ended its partnership with Binance in July. Such indicates the growing concerns of holding partnerships with companies currently surrounded by intense regulatory scrutiny.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that companies are withdrawing interest crypto as a mainstream payment method. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) still offer a range of crypto cards, allowing people to make hassle-free payments using their crypto assets.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) offers prepaid cards funded by Tap, Nexo, and Gemini. The company's efforts in transforming the crypto landscape continue, regardless of the scrutiny around the crypto market. On August 17, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) announced its new Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Partner Program. To kick-start the program, the company involved a group of leading blockchain providers to join the program. These include Ripple, Consensys, Fluency, Idemia, Consult Hyperion, Giesecke+Devrient, and FireBlocks. The company understands the importance of having a government-mandated public digital currency. Raj Dhamodharan, head of digital assets and blockchain at Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), spearheading the program, stated:\n\n\"We believe in payment choice, and that interoperability across the different ways of making payments is an essential component of a flourishing economy. As we look toward a digitally driven future, it will be essential that the value held as a CBDC is as easy to use as other forms of money.\"\n\nSimilarly, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is also making leaps in the crypto market. On September 5, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) announced it is expanding its stablecoin capabilities. The company will now introduce the USDC stablecoin on the Solana blockchain network. The company has been experimenting with the USDC stablecoin since 2021 and has now integrated the Solana network due to its efficient and speedy systems. Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto, Visa, stated:\n\n\"By leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we're helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to send or receive funds from Visa's treasury easily. Visa is committed to being on the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation and leveraging these new technologies to help improve how we move money.\"\n\nBlock, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a leading financial technology and software firm based in the United States. The company formerly began the development of Bitkey, a crypto product. This product is made to store all your digital assets in a physical wallet. The company is making leaps in the industry and reports strong earnings, which reflects that the crypto industry is far from declining. On August 3, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) reported results from the second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.39 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.02. The company's revenue for the quarter jumped 25.67% year over year and amounted to $5.53 billion, ahead of market consensus by $433.36 million. Jack Dorsey, head of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), also discussed the company's plans and important partnerships to boost the integration of cryptocurrencies in the business. He stated:\n\n\"Earlier this year, we shared plans for the public beta testing of our bitcoin wallet, Bitkey. And in June, we announced our first two global partners, Coinbase and Cash App, to allow customers to buy and immediately transfer bitcoin from those custodial platforms into Bitkey's self-custody wallet.\"\n\nLarge corporations investing in the development of crypto is a positive sign for cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. However, crypto-friendly laws are essential to boost crypto ownership and establish crypto as a primary payment method. With that, let's take a look at the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most.\n\n20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most\n\nPhoto by bitcoin executium on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most, we integrated three different metrics. These included the total population from the World Bank, the percentage of the total population that owns cryptocurrencies by Triple A, and the crypto adoption index by Chainanalysis. We considered data as of 2022 for consistency across all our metrics. The crypto adoption index by Chain Analysis is based on five different metrics. These metrics are a combination of the retail value of the cryptocurrencies, the value of cryptocurrencies at centralized exchanges, and trade volume.\n\nWe shortlisted the top 50 countries from each of the three data sources. The crypto adoption index and percentage of the total population that owns crypto were given a higher priority. Of the two databases, we chose the first 20 common countries for our list. The figures for the total population were included as reference figures to add credibility to our data.\n\nAccording to our hypothesis, high crypto usage will translate as high bitcoin usage. We have ranked the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most in ascending order.\n\n20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most\n\n20.

        "content": "Today Nomura\u2019s digital assets subsidiary Laser Digital unveiled its Bitcoin Adoption Fund targeting institutional investors. It\u2019s a Cayman Islands long-only mutual fund with the digital asset custody secured by Komainu.\n\nNomura cofounded Komainu as a regulated custodian in 2018 alongside tech security firm Ledger and asset manager Coinshares.\n\n\u201cTechnology is a key driver of global economic growth and is transforming a large part of the economy from analogue to digital,\u201d said Sebastien Guglietta, Head of Laser Digital Asset Management. \u201cBitcoin is one of the enablers of this long-lasting transformational change.\u201d\n\nGuglietta who leads the fund, was formerly Chief Scientist at Nomura. Before that he held the same role at Brevan Howard as well as portfolio manager.\n\nAsset management is the second part of Laser Digital\u2019s strategy. It launched with a venture capital fund, which has invested across web3, especially DeFi. The third arm will be digital asset trading. It\u2019s no coincidence that it bought elysium, a post trade solution for FX and digital assets.\n\nInstitutional Bitcoin funds\n\nThe crypto community is eagerly awaiting the first U.S. authorization of a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). While that might encourage consumer adoption in the U.S., exchange traded products have already been available elsewhere. One example is the Coinshares Physical Crypto ETP.\n\nHowever, institutions have also been able to get exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding crypto. Several large banks, including Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan partnered with crypto specialist asset managers NYDIG and Galaxy Digital. NYDIG has several funds with more than $750 million (January) in assets under management just in its NYDIG Institutional Bitcoin Fund. Last year BlackRock launched a Bitcoin investment trust.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the notorious Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which reached a discount to net asset value price of almost 50% at the start of the year. Although it recently recovered to a deficit of \u201cjust\u201d 20% after winning an SEC lawsuit."

        "title": "Sub-Saharan Africa Crypto Adoption Trends and Analysis - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "This post is an excerpt from our 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report. Download your copy now!\n\nSimilar to previous years, Sub-Saharan Africa has the smallest crypto economy of all regions, accounting for 2.3% of global transaction volume between July 2022 and June 2023. During that time period, the region received an estimated $117.1 billion in on-chain value.\n\nAcross the entire region during the time period studied, centralized exchanges are the most-used platform type, facilitating over half of all transaction volume. Sub-Saharan\u2019s cryptocurrency market also appears more retail-driven than most, with a larger share of transaction volume coming in transactions under $1 million in value compared to most other regions.\n\nAlthough Sub-Saharan Africa has consistently been one of the smallest cryptocurrency markets, a closer analysis reveals that crypto has penetrated key markets and become an important part of many residents\u2019 day-to-day lives. As we\u2019ll explore in more detail later, no country exemplifies this better than Nigeria, which ranks second overall on our Global Crypto Adoption Index and also leads the region in raw transaction volume.\n\nOther countries in the region ranking high on the index include Kenya (21), Ghana (29), and South Africa (31). Keep reading to learn what drives crypto adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa and learn how recent regulatory developments have impacted local markets.\n\nCitizens flock to Bitcoin and stablecoins to protect against inflation and debt\n\nIn no region is Bitcoin more dominant than Sub-Saharan Africa, as the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency makes up a bigger share of transaction volume there than in any other region.\n\nWhy the disproportionate uptake of Bitcoin? It may be that Sub-Saharan Africa residents are turning to so-called digital gold for an alternative store of value. Many countries in the region have struggled with rising inflation and debt, making cryptocurrency an attractive means of storing value, preserving savings, and attaining greater financial freedom. In Ghana, for instance, inflation reached 29.8% in June 2022 after 13 consecutive months of increases \u2014 that marks its highest level in two decades. With relatively few financial opportunities, many Ghanians have turned to Bitcoin. Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa have all faced similar problems in recent years, and all show a great deal of grassroots cryptocurrency adoption \u2014 that\u2019s probably no coincidence.\n\nHowever, experts on the ground tell us that some market participants have turned away from Bitcoin and towards stablecoins of late, as these generally see less price volatility than Bitcoin, whose price is well off all-time highs. Moyo Sodipo, Co-Founder and CPO of Nigeria-based cryptocurrency exchange Busha, provided some insight into this activity, stating, \u201cWhen Busha gained popularity around 2019 and 2020, there was a big frenzy for Bitcoin. A lot of people were not initially keen on stablecoins. Now that Bitcoin has lost a lot of its value, there is a desire for diversification between Bitcoin and stablecoins. However, market shifts aren\u2019t dampening activity. People are constantly looking for opportunities to hedge against the devaluation of the Naira and the persistent economic decline since COVID.\u201d\n\nSpotlight: Nigeria is Africa\u2019s top crypto economy\n\nNigeria boasts the largest population and economy in Sub-Saharan Africa, and as discussed above, the largest cryptocurrency economy as well. Perhaps even more notable is that Nigeria\u2019s crypto economy continues to grow despite market turmoil. In fact, Nigeria is one of only six countries in the top 50 by size globally whose crypto transaction volume grew year-over-year in the time period we studied. Its growth rate of 9.0% places it third among those six.\n\nThe evidence suggests crypto is one solution to Nigeria\u2019s economic challenges. Since 2016, Nigeria has suffered from two major recessions, fueled by an unstable political situation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the collapse of oil prices. Consequently, Nigerians of all ages are facing high unemployment \u2014 more than 20 million people were looking for jobs in 2021 \u2014 and many are up and moving to other countries.\n\nThe recent Naira crisis has exacerbated these issues. In 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced its intentions to redesign the Naira and issue new notes in order to combat inflation and counterfeiting, as well as take more control over how much currency is circulating.\n\nUnfortunately, the resulting cash shortage placed enormous pressure on the country\u2019s unbanked population and triggered uncertainty regarding the use of old notes \u2014 all during an election period and a record high inflation rate of more than 20% at the beginning of 2023. Nigeria\u2019s uncertain economic climate has encouraged many citizens to seek financial alternatives, increasing the value proposition of cryptocurrency.\n\nThese dynamics are reflected in the data. On the chart below, we can see that interest in Bitcoin and stablecoins has generally risen as the Naira\u2019s value has decreased, particularly during the most recent extremely steep drops in June and July of 2023. The higher spikes around May and November of 2022, however, were likely driven more by users seeking to trade on the volatility spurred by TerraLuna and FTX\u2019s collapses respectively, as opposed to the local economic situation.\n\nAt the same time, interest in altcoins has been growing across the region lately. Moyo Sodipo explained, \u201cOn days when the market tanks, we\u2019ve also seen a buying frenzy. It depends on the dynamics of the market at that point in time. When there is a new memecoin, like Dogecoin or Shiba, there has also been a buying frenzy. Someone is always going to be interested in a token that seems like it could make you the next couple thousand dollars.\u201d The below chart illustrates this increase in altcoin activity, as well as the proportionally large percentage of monthly stablecoin value.\n\nRegulatory developments throughout Sub-Saharan Africa open the door to more crypto growth\n\nRegulation has also brought activity to exchanges in Sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa in particular has been one of the region\u2019s leaders in terms of crypto regulation and the development of supportive trading frameworks. At the end of 2022, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) announced a licensing regime for cryptocurrency businesses and declared that crypto assets are financial products, lending them greater legal clarity, and also empowering financial investigators to better fight illicit activity in the space.\n\nThe country\u2019s proactive approach to regulation has removed a lot of regulatory uncertainty and thus encouraged trading of both established and emerging digital tokens. In fact, citizens of the country have traded billions of dollars worth of digital currency in recent years. According to Marius Reitz, General Manager Africa at South Africa-based exchange Luno, \u201cPresently, the predominant use case for crypto in South Africa revolves around investment. Over the last 3 years, the number of customers holding a meaningful crypto balance on Luno has increased by almost 50%.\u201d He added, \u201cIn markets with no regulatory bans, we tend to see the industry develop more responsibly as the market operates above the ground, with more productive interaction between regulators and exchanges. But bans aren\u2019t stopping people from wanting crypto. The crypto industry will continue to grow with or without regulation. It is just in everyone\u2019s interest that there is some pragmatic regulation in place that protects consumers and creates a safer operating environment for all.\u201d\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has also been navigating the crypto landscape, issuing statements on potential volatility risks at the same time as leaders consider the implementation of a CBDC. At the beginning of 2023, the government proposed a bill advocating for a consistent securities definition of digital currencies and diligent recordkeeping by licensed crypto traders. Around the same time, the Nigerian government approved a national blockchain policy, highlighting ways blockchain adoption can benefit the country and paving the way for future legal framework.\n\nIn Mauritius, which is slightly behind Kenya in terms of raw cryptocurrency transaction volume, the Virtual Assets and Initial Token Offering Services Act of 2021 has provided comprehensive legislation for new token issuance. The country\u2019s sustained dedication toward protecting consumers has helped promote crypto adoption and attracted traders while other countries in the region have issued explicit or implicit bans on certain crypto-related activities.\n\nThe increased regulatory clarity provided by the flurry of recent legislation may be helping Africa\u2019s local cryptocurrency industry. As discussed above, many of the most important crypto regulations enacted by Africa\u2019s biggest countries came around early 2023. Check out the chart below, which compares relative growth in Sub-Saharan usage of local, homegrown crypto exchanges vs. international exchanges.\n\nThe consumer safety afforded by better regulations, the confidence those regulations give consumers, and local crypto businesses\u2019 ability to comply with those regulations may be part of why local African exchanges have been outpacing international competitors on growth within the region since early 2023.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s crypto economy?\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency in Sub-Saharan Africa looks bright, with large countries like Nigeria already taking their place as global leaders in crypto adoption. Increasing regulatory clarity throughout the region also appears to be bolstering growth, which local crypto operators appear primed to take advantage of. The key lesson though is the same we\u2019ve gotten from studying emerging markets over the years: While residents of wealthier nations may have buy and sell more cryptocurrency than those of emerging markets, the latter has a greater day-to-day need for cryptocurrency, very much in line with the original vision for Bitcoin and the sector at large.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Could Surge Before, After 2024 Halving - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Another bitcoin halving \u2014 the event that lowers rewards for miners, thus tightening supply of the flagship cryptocurrency \u2014 is coming in six months.\n\nThere are instances of halvings boosting bitcoin prices, but it\u2019s not a guarantee. This time around, there\u2019s much division among cryptomarket observers regarding whether or not the 2024 event will be a catalyst for bitcoin prices.\n\nHowever, one noted crypto expert \u2013 the X (formerly Twitter) account known as BitQuant \u2014 believes the upcoming halving could be a major upside catalyst for bitcoin prices. If that predication proves accurate, exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) and the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC) could benefit.\n\n\u201cNo, bitcoin is not going to top before the halving. Yes, it\u2019s going to reach a new all-time high before the halving,\u201d according to a recent BitQuant xeet. \u201cNo BTC is not going to $160K because the magnitude of every pullback is large.\u201d\n\nPotential Benefits Abound for Bitcoin Funds BLKC, SATO\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time high is around $69,000, meaning it\u2019d need to more than double from current levels to get back to that price range. Alone, that would likely propel BLKC and SATO due to the fact that both ETFs are chock full of crypto-correlated equities.\n\nAdditionally, BitQuant isn\u2019t saying bitcoin can\u2019t make it to $160,000. Rather, the expert acknowledges that there could be another significant retreat when prior highs come into play and another pullback if the $125,000 price range becomes a factor.\n\n\u201cThere will be one pullback before breaking to a new all-time high, followed by another pullback around $125K. Additionally, there will be two more pullbacks after the halving,\u201d added the expert in another xeet.\n\nBitQuant added that bitcoin\u2019s price could peak after the 2024 halving, which implies that the digital currency will experience a rally in advance of and after that event. The market observer\u2019s price forecast is $250,000, or more than nine times where it currently resides.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious projection to be sure, and one that would almost assuredly benefit assets such as BLKC and SATO. It also jibes with the forecasts of other cryptomarket specialists who believe that the mid-$30,000s or even low $40,000s are reasonable expectations for a year-end price in 2023 before bitcoin ascends to six-figure territory around next year\u2019s halving.\n\nvettafi.com is owned by VettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d).

        "title": "What Europe's new spot Bitcoin ETF means for global markets - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The crypto world is abuzz with Europe\u2019s groundbreaking introduction of its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund from Jacobi Asset Management, listed on Euronext Amsterdam \u2014 a listing that took two years after initial approval in 2021. This development marks a pivotal moment in the continent\u2019s financial history and sets a precedent for other jurisdictions to potentially follow.\n\nIn the wake of this, there\u2019s a palpable sense of anticipation. As digital assets gain traction, Europe\u2019s decision underscores a commitment to innovation while addressing the complexities of the crypto market \u2014 the harbinger of a global shift towards a more inclusive and diversified financial ecosystem. With Hong Kong\u2019s renewed ambition to be a major crypto hub and debuting retail crypto trading via licensed exchanges, it may not be long before we see the first spot Bitcoin ETF in Asia, too.\n\nEurope paving the digital highway\n\nOver the past decade, Europe has witnessed a steady growth and acceptance of digital assets. From the grassroots level of early enthusiasts trading cryptocurrencies to towering financial institutions exploring and adopting blockchain solutions, the continent has championed digital asset innovation.\n\nThis commitment to progress has set the stage for the current developments. Pivotal regulatory discussions, such as the European Union\u2019s deliberations on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, have sculpted the digital financial landscape in Europe. These regulatory strides, buoyed by interest from institutional investors, have culminated in the introduction of the spot Bitcoin ETF, marking a significant leap forward.\n\nInside the spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF offers a more appealing route for institutional and professional investors to invest in Bitcoin through a more familiar product structure. The ETF offers a structured and regulated way for investors to tap into Bitcoin\u2019s potential. Unlike holding Bitcoin directly, which comes with security and storage concerns, the ETF provides a more traditional investment vehicle.\n\nStory continues\n\nJacobi\u2019s ETF is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and trades under the ticker BCOIN. What sets Jacobi\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF apart is its stringent regulatory compliance, ensuring investor protection. By bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world, it showcases the transformative potential of such instruments in the evolving financial landscape.\n\nAs Europe leads, US remains reluctant\n\nEurope\u2019s introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF sets it apart as a pioneer, especially when contrasted with the United States, which, despite its dominant crypto market presence, has been reticent in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis strategic divergence could recalibrate global financial market dynamics, potentially positioning Europe as a magnet for digital asset investments. The more conservative stance in the U.S., likely rooted in regulatory apprehensions and market fluctuations, accentuates the differences in regulatory visions between the two jurisdictions. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities that digital assets present, emphasizing the need for a nuanced and informed regulatory perspective.\n\nRipple effects beyond Bitcoin\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\u2019s introduction might act as a catalyst \u2014 it\u2019s akin to opening a door, inviting other digital assets to step into the spotlight. This pioneering step could spur the development of ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies or even lead to the creation of multi-asset cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s debut could also influence investor strategies, potentially driving more institutional investment into the digital asset space.\n\nOld giants learning new dance\n\nTraditional financial entities, spanning banks to asset managers, now grapple with the undeniable reality of digital assets becoming mainstream. The once clear lines between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies are blurring. As digital assets gain legitimacy, especially with regulatory clarity in certain jurisdictions, the financial sector is undergoing a transformative shift.\n\nWe\u2019re also witnessing an uptick in traditional banks establishing relationships with crypto companies, propelled, in part, by the U.S. bank closures earlier this year. In March, Coinbase partnered with Standard Chartered in Singapore for free fund transfers. Following Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure, Circle announced Cross River as its new banking partner. In Switzerland, Arab Bank reported an increase in U.S. firms from the crypto space seeking banking services after Silvergate\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe broader financial sector might witness seismic shifts in asset allocation strategies, advisory services, and financial product portfolios in response to this digital renaissance. The dynamic landscape painted above highlights the adaptability of the financial world.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s effect on regulatory perspectives\n\nGrayscale\u2019s recent court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a testament to the changing tides. The federal appeals court\u2019s decision to side with Grayscale, challenging the SEC\u2019s rejection of their spot Bitcoin ETF, is significant. According to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou in a recent note: \u201cIt looks more likely that the SEC would be forced to approve the Spot Bitcoin ETF applications that are still pending from several asset managers, including that from Grayscale.\u201d This not only underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets but also highlights the need for regulatory bodies to adapt to the evolving financial landscape.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s landmark victory against the SEC has set a precedent that could catalyze the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. This development could inject more competition into the market, potentially lowering fees for investors.\n\nBalancing innovation and regulation\n\nThe introduction of an avant-garde financial instrument like a spot Bitcoin ETF is not devoid of pitfalls. From market volatility to regulatory uncertainties, there are challenges to consider. Vigilant regulatory oversight becomes paramount to anchor market stability and shield investors from potential market manipulations or fraud. As with any investment, education is key. Ensuring that investors are well-informed can prevent speculative bubbles and uninformed investment decisions.\n\nEurope\u2019s Bitcoin ETF introduction signals a new era in finance, where digital assets and traditional finance come together. As Europe treads this new path, the balance between innovation and regulation will be pivotal to ensure a stable and prosperous financial future.\n\nThe journey has just begun. Collaborative efforts, informed regulations and continuous education will be crucial as Europe navigates the evolving digital asset space. And Grayscale\u2019s win across the water is another positive sign of progress."

Laser Venture Capital has already invested in over ten crypto startups to date, including Orderly Network, WebN Group and Infinity Exchange, according to The Block Pro's Deals Dashboard. In June, Laser Digital acquired Elysium Technology Group to provide post-trade solutions for over-the-counter foreign exchange and digital assets.\n\nLast month, Laser Digital's Dubai entity received operating license approval from the city's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority.

It happens approximately every four years and is a deflationary process that cuts the production of new coins by 50%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving is a high-profile event for crypto investors and has historically led to an increase in BTC\u2019s price. However, its impact on the mining industry is a more complex issue. It reduces block rewards, one of the primary revenue streams for miners. The 2024 halving will reduce it from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. That\u2019s why miners must adapt their strategies to compensate for the reduced rewards resulting from the halving.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the strategies and alternative income sources that may help Bitcoin miners amid hostile market conditions.\n\nChanging mindsets\n\nBitcoin mining involves a competitive process where miners vie for block rewards. This competition is driven by Bitcoin\u2019s block time, which averages around 10 minutes per block on the protocol level. Whether the network\u2019s computing power is relatively low at 1 kilo hash per second or surges to a massive 200 million terra hashes per second, the same block rewards must be distributed among miners.\n\nRelated: An ETF will bring a revolution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\nThis competitive environment encourages miners to prioritize energy efficiency and the use of cost-effective hardware. With each halving event, where block rewards are cut by 50%, this trend toward efficiency gains momentum. As the cost of producing a single BTC is set to approximately double shortly after the next halving, miners will need to explore ways to optimize their profitability and focus on these three critical factors.\n\nBitcoin miners\u2019 survival rests on these three whales\n\nThe first and most important \u201cwhale\u201d is the cost of electricity. Even a modest fluctuation of 1 cent per kilowatt-hour (kWh) can lead to a substantial $3,800 variance in the production cost of BTC, according to JPMorgan. To bolster their post-halving profitability, miners are exploring sophisticated contracts and contemplating relocation to countries or regions where electricity prices are lower. They even consider power generation from stranded gas options. I believe that it\u2019s crucial for miners to secure electricity rates at or below 5 cents/kWh to maintain profitability beyond April 2024.\n\nThe second major factor demanding miners\u2019 attention is the efficiency of their equipment. For instance, daily BTC mining costs can be slashed by more than 63% when upgrading from a rig with a 60 joules per terahash (J/TH) efficiency rating to one with a 22 J/TH rating. Miners boasting hardware efficiency and benefiting from lower electricity costs will be the most profitable. They are the ones most likely to weather significant market events like the upcoming halving.\n\nAdditionally, I suggest miners employ the third strategy that involves accumulating excess capital in mined BTC during profitable periods. This reserve can serve as a buffer against the impact of reduced block rewards post-halving. When the post-halving rally occurs, miners can capitalize on their reserves by selling mined assets at a higher profit margin, helping to offset the losses.\n\nWhile strategies such as securing lower electricity rates, adopting more energy-efficient mining equipment, and utilizing reserve capital can mitigate the adverse effects, the 2024 halving will bring substantial pressure on miners. It can lead to the potential closure of numerous mining operations. Thus, miners will also need to explore alternative revenue streams. One promising opportunity for miners lies in projects like Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nOther ways\n\nBitcoin Ordinals have recently garnered significant attention by driving transaction fees within the Bitcoin network to new highs. Ordinal \u201cinscriptions,\u201d the metadata attached to each satoshi, are unique assets created directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, similar to a nonfungible token (NFT). To obtain one, users typically engage with the platform or protocol responsible for Ordinals.\n\nRelated: 10 years later, still no Bitcoin ETF \u2014 but who cares?\n\nAs the number of inscriptions rises \u2014 surpassing 25.5 million as of August \u2014 so does the revenue generated from transactions, which presently stands above $53 million. This trend suggests that alternative income streams for miners may gain prominence in the long term.\n\nOrdinals shift the profitability equation for miners, increasing user demand for creating inscriptions, initiating processing transactions on the Bitcoin network and incentivizing miners to include their transactions in the next block.\n\nWe can certainly expect more developments on top of the Bitcoin network that will enable miners to adapt more effectively to the post-halving landscape. As we move closer to the halving event, miners must prioritize the aforementioned strategies to optimize their profitability and stay open to new alternatives on the horizon.\n\nDidar Bekbauov is the CEO of Bitcoin mining company Xive, which he co-founded in 2019.

        "title": "What Happens After A Spot Bitcoin ETF is Approved? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "One of the latest developments in the Bitcoin market is the potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). An ETF is a financial product that allows investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. In the case of a Bitcoin ETF, it would provide investors with a convenient way to invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. But what would happen if a Bitcoin ETF is approved? Let's dive into the potential implications and outcomes.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe Basics of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would function similarly to other ETFs, in that it would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and subject to strict reporting requirements. This would provide investors with a level of transparency and oversight that is often lacking in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, a Bitcoin ETF would bring institutional-grade custody solutions, reducing the risk of theft or loss of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Role of ETFs in the Financial Market\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF would likely lead to increased market liquidity. As more investors enter the market through the ETF, the overall trading volume of Bitcoin would likely increase. This increased liquidity could help stabilize the price of Bitcoin and reduce volatility, making it a more attractive investment option for both retail and institutional investors.\n\nAdditionally, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have positive implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. It would signal a greater acceptance and recognition of Bitcoin by regulatory authorities, potentially leading to increased adoption and mainstream integration of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Regulatory Hurdles\n\nRegulators have expressed concerns about the potential for market manipulation, lack of investor protection, and the possibility of fraud in the Bitcoin market. These concerns have led the SEC to reject multiple Bitcoin ETF proposals in the past.\n\nHowever, proponents of a Bitcoin ETF argue that the market has matured significantly since those rejections. They highlight the introduction of regulated exchanges, increased transparency, and the growing interest from institutional investors as signs of a more robust and regulated ecosystem.\n\nThe Current Status of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nAs of now, the SEC has not approved any Bitcoin ETFs. However, several companies have filed proposals, with some making significant progress towards approval. The industry eagerly awaits a decision from the SEC, which could have far-reaching consequences for the Bitcoin market.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF holds significant implications for the Bitcoin market and the broader financial industry. It would provide investors with a regulated and convenient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially driving increased demand and liquidity. Additionally, it could attract institutional investors, bringing stability and validation to the market. However, risks and challenges, such as market volatility and regulatory uncertainties, must be carefully considered. Only time will tell how the journey towards Bitcoin ETF approval unfolds, but the potential outcomes warrant close attention from investors and regulators alike.\n\nBitcoin Backstage with Dylan LeClair\n\nDylan\u2019s advice in a bear market\n\n\u201cJust understand what you own. You cannot borrow someone else\u2019s conviction. You need to understand what bitcoin is, where it is potentially going, think of the long term game, and stay humble and stack sats.\u201d\n\nDylan\u2019s advice to newcomers\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of work to understand what bitcoin is, but ultimately bitcoin is a savings mechanism that no one can mess with if you safely self custody your bitcoin.\u201d\n\nDylan left us off with \u201cBitcoin fixes the government monopoly on money and currency debasement.\u201d\n\nQuick Bitcoin News Recap of the Week\n\nPaxos Fat Fingered Bitcoin\n\nWhile at first it looked like PayPal overpaid by over a whopping half a million dollars, or about 19 bitcoin worth of transaction fees with on-chains analytics, it was actually Paxos that caused the error.\n\nCoinbase Integrates Lightning\n\nCoinbase announces plans to integrate the Lightning Network onto their exchange platform. CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted out saying that Bitcoin is the most important asset in cryptocurrency.\n\nCEO of Binance US Leaves Company\n\nBrian Shroder, the CEO of Binance.US, leaves the company, news that preceded 33% of the Binance workforce being laid off. It seems the pressure from the SEC lawsuit back in June is boiling up quickly.\n\nFTX Clawbacks\n\nIt was disclosed in court papers that they analyzed certain payments dished out to athletes before the company unraveled last November and found that some can be claimed through clawbacks during Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThey want to clawback payments to athletes such as Shaquille O\u2019Neal, tennis star Naomi Osaka, and other athletes and teams that promoted FTX.\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele of El Salvador meets with the Emir of Qatar\n\nPresident Bukele and the Emir of Qatar met to discuss commercial corporations between both countries, and presumably about Bitcoin.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Tops $27K as Fed's Powell Might Be More 'Hawkish': Strategist - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Bitcoin is breaking above $27,000. As us traders see greater odds of the Federal Reserve keeping rates unchanged this week and perhaps for the rest of the year joining us now to discuss is Matrix Port head of research and strategy, Marcus Steen. Welcome Marcus. Thanks for having me. Good to see you. So, you know, we, we look at this latest move up in, in Bitcoin uh above 27,000, it looked pretty dismal. I think even your own uh research uh just a few, a few days ago, it seems would have said quite the opposite that this was going in the other direction. Uh Even though there were some bullish signs nonetheless, it was a, it, it, I don't know if anyone expected this to happen so quickly, but over the weekend, a move up above 27,000. What was the catalyst here? I, is it really this sort of risk on with the fed not raising rates uh potentially at this upcoming meeting this week or uh at the next meeting as well? I mean, you could make an argument that of course, Powell is gonna be a little bit more hawkish, uh, coming, you know, the, this, this, uh, FO MC meeting, you know, we have higher oil prices. Uh, we had last week, of course, the upsides of price in the CP I index, we had, we have a stronger dollar, uh, we have a higher 10 year bond yield. So I think you can make an argument that Powell might be a little bit more hawkish. Maybe the market is not going to buy into it, but of course, he could be hawkish. But of course, the, you know, coin itself has been in a very tight range over the last kind of like one or two months. And the fact is that we are breaking now high. And if you can close here, actually, this sets off all sets off our, our kind of technical trading signals and this actually could be quite bullish for, for Bitcoin itself. But nevertheless, I think we can also paint a bar picture on some of the al coins on Ethereum. So I think it's more like a relative trade. And I think what's very interesting to note here is when we started to break down like last week in Bitcoin in, in the overall crypto market at exactly the same level when when Blackrock announced the ETF, the Bitcoin ETF filing at 25,100 at exactly the same level we heard actually that Franklin Templeton is coming out with, with Bitcoin ETF. So it seems like uh there is a quite an interesting coincidence here at this level that this level is really protected in the market. And it reminds us a little bit of what happened in 2017 with Bitcoin. So I I you you brought up the old coins and there's one in particular Solana, Solana had a nice slight bounce a few weeks ago prior to an announcement since then. Uh It's now the funding rate is now negative uh negative 35%. Uh last data that I have here at the time. They, it and it's been and it's just over the past few days in which the funding rate has gone negative. In other words, people are paying borrowers to go along in uh in, in Salana that and this is, this is just a pretty bearish uh outlook. What is, first of all, what's your take on that slight bump prior to their announce uh their, their partnership announcement? Was there anything involved in um a a, do we know anything about who the potential buyers were? And is this latest selloff or, and this negative out? Look if you will a product of the fear of the FTX, uh uh the, the FTX selloff that will potentially happen as uh a a as the company tries to recoup recoup dollars for its creditors. Yeah, I think of course, that's, that's an overhang and I think the number was a little bit low larger than people initially expected how much actually the FTX creditors can sell. Uh they got the green light so they will be ongoing selling at least until end of the year. You know, we estimate and by the by the $200 million cap that has been uh um kind of flagged flagged by the creditor team and where they got the approval from. But also, I think overall SOLANA is really fighting a little bit for, you know, for, for its existence here, the market cap is still quite high. Um At the same time, you know, the the protocol has still various outages. Um it has really not delivered on a lot of those promises. I mean, you might recall, they wanted to come out with a Solana uh phone beginning of the year and it came out. I mean, nobody has heard of it really or nobody is using it. So, and I think a lot of those, those NF or high frequency trading has actually moved to, to other venues. So I think Solana itself is, is a very high beta and it's quite, quite at risk of of breaking down lower Marcus on the topic of this appending alt coin crash. You also said that crypto VC funds are under immense pressure to return funds to their investors. Um What do you what unpack that for us? What is driving this pressure? Yeah. So for example, a lot of investors have of course made huge returns in in those crypto VC funds, you know, over the last few years, I mean, some funds are up, you know, 10, 2030 times, but of course, they have given back a lot of, a lot of the money as well. And I think now some investors say, well, maybe now we're going to redeploy the capital into another area, maybe in A I, so we rather cash out here. And of course, those we see funds, they are early investors in in various projects. Be it a infinity? Be it be, you know, for example, a coin and these unlocks uh are happening, you know, we had one over the weekend. Um and when we flag this, for example, a month ago, the acorn is actually down 30% right? And this despite, for example, that Bitcoin is more or less, you know, held up. So we like to really pair, you know, certain tokens against Bitcoin because we have, of course, a lot more uh buying pressure potentially uh through these ETF S announcement. And when you, when you look very carefully, Bitcoin actually peaked out so far this year in July versus EUM peaked out in April. So you really can see that all these announcements about Bitcoin ETF S have really not really been been benefiting with these Al coins or even Ethereum. And then of course, ec MS revenue has been dropping now for three consecutive months. And I think this just shows that people are not really engaging with Ethereum or other um kind of like al coins. And I think this just sets a negative um you know, precedent for those protocols. But going back to your question is really, you know, if I'm ABC investor uh or if I'm an investor in ABC Fund, of course, I would like to like to have some, some payouts now and every time these unlocks are coming and these unlocks coming really in, in large numbers, for example, last weekend, you know, it's around like 11% of the, the market cap of a coin unlocked. So I rather, you know, encourage, you know, my, my BC manager to come of sell the tokens and distribute the money back to, you know, to the, to the, I guess to the LP S and of course, in a, in a month's time, we have uh you know, another unlock for a infinity. And these, these unlocks are really uh tokens that the VC investors, you know, got over the last few years and they're certainly, you know, investing now. And so I think there's this constant pressure now uh for those tokens to really just uh see a lot of liquidation happening. So bottom line, do you see the al apocalypse, the, the, the end or the pretty much the end of alt coins coming up? And if so how soon? Well, I think, you know, of course, you know, it helps if the over crypto market was lower than for, to call for a Bitcoin crash. And as long as, or for a crypto crash, but as long as of course, a Bitcoin stays above 25,000, I think we are sort of in a, in a safe or in a neutral zone. But as soon as we, we get closer to this level, I think the risk is, is really high. Um, and I think you also have to look, you know, what was the real, the real driver of the last of the last bull market? And I think of the 21 bull market, there were two drivers, there were, of course, the yield farming craze. Uh, this was really like a child of the zero interest rate policies and we are no longer in this environment. So it's unlikely that those, uh, those yield farming tokens, you know, really come back in a, in an environment when interest rates are very high. Uh, or the other factor was, of course, the second leg of, of the 21 bull market was, of course, the NF uh, but so far, I mean, you know, we, we know all the volumes of NFTS and uh, the correction keeps on going lower. So I think those are, are the ones that are really at risk, anything around Gamification, anything around, um, you know, NFTS and anything around yield farming. I don't think they want to come back in any new bull market. I mean, I'm still quite constructive on Bitcoin overall. And I think we we're gonna have a new bull market uh you know, into next year, but I would be very careful with some of the dialings of the previous bull market and especially with some of these al coins that are seeing a lot of unlock happening. Marquez. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Thank you. That was Matrix Port, Head of Research and strategy Marcus. Th."

        "content": "Just a couple of years ago, cryptocurrency seemed like an investment not to be missed:\n\n\"We had heard so many stories of people getting rich overnight on crypto that even like the craziest promises seemed kind of plausible,\" Zeke Faux says.\n\nBut then came 2022 and the trillion-dollar crypto wipeout.\n\nNow, crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to go to trial on fraud charges. We\u2019re in the depths of crypto winter. $2 trillion in value wiped out last year.\n\nToday, On Point: Tales from the world of cryptocurrency and casino capitalism.\n\nGuests\n\nZeke Faux, investigative reporter for Bloomberg Businessweek. Author of \"Number Go Up: Inside Crypto\u2019s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall.\"\n\nBook Excerpt\n\nExcerpted from Number Go Up: Inside Crypto\u2019s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall by Zeke Faux. Copyright \u00a9 2023 by Zeke Faux. Excerpted by permission of Crown Currency, an imprint of Crown Publishing, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.\n\nTranscript\n\nPart I\n\nDEBORAH BECKER: Two weeks from today, perhaps the most well-known cryptocurrency billionaire faces trial on fraud charges. It's been a spectacular fall for Sam Bankman-Fried, who was arrested 10 months ago, going from running one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX, from his $30 million Bahamas penthouse, to now sitting in a jail in Brooklyn.\n\nShortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Freed said no one had been intentionally defrauded. There were just some management failures. Here's what he told George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America.\n\nSAM BANKMAN-FRIED: I wasn't spending any time or effort trying to manage risk on FTX. Trying, and that, that obviously --\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: That's a stunning admission.\n\nBANKMAN-FRIED: What?\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That's a pretty stunning admission.\n\nBANKMAN-FRIED: Yeah, I mean it, I don't know what to say. What happened. And if I had been, if I had been spending an hour a day thinking about risk management on FTX, I don't think that would have happened. I think I stopped working as hard for a bit. Honestly, if I look back on myself, I think I got a little cocky, maybe more than a little bit.\n\nBECKER: What Bankman-Fried banked on was the volume of people investing in crypto. Celebrity endorsements were used to try to convince people not to miss out on investing in digital currency. Celebrities like former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady urged others to use FTX, Bankman-Fried's digital exchange.\n\nHere's Brady holding a portable flamethrower in an ad for FTX.\n\nTOM BRADY: You don't need a flamethrower to buy, sell, or trade Bitcoin and crypto safely. You just need FTX.\n\nBECKER: The Justice Department is now reviewing those ads as the investigation continues into Bankman-Fried and other crypto moguls after the staggering fall of crypto with $2 trillion estimated to have been wiped out in the last year.\n\nI'm Deborah Becker, in for Magna Chakrabarti, and this is On Point. Our guest this hour has spent some time talking with Sam Bankman-Fried and dozens of others for his new book about the cryptocurrency world. He spent years talking with those who won and those who lost in the complex digital currency universe.\n\nZeke Faux is an investigative reporter with Bloomberg Businessweek. He's author of the new book titled \"Number Go Up: Inside Crypto\u2019s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall.\" Zeke Faux, welcome to On Point.\n\nZEKE FAUX: Thanks so much, Deborah.\n\nBECKER: So you wrote in your book that you had done a piece about Sam Bankman-Fried earlier when FTX was still riding high in the crypto bubble, and that may have been why he agreed to talk with you again as his arrest was imminent.\n\nExplain to us how that interview took place and tell us, who was Sam Bankman-Fried?\n\nFAUX: I was fascinated by his story from the start. What really got me was that, here was a kid that when he was in college at MIT, he was really committed to this idea he wanted to do something good for the world.\n\nAnd he met a philosopher who pitched him this idea of earning to give. He said, \"Hey, you've been handing out pamphlets for this vegan group. Anyone could do that. You're really smart. How about you get rich and then give that money away?\" And then when I met him, it's less than 10 years later. He's 29 years old.\n\nHe's one of the richest people in the world, and he's saying that he did it all out of this motive of altruism. And yet he hadn't really given very much away. So, I was really fascinated by this idea of whether he would follow through. Or whether he'd be corrupted by his quest to amass as much power and money as possible.\n\nAnd, as you said, when things were going well, I flew down, I spent a couple days with him, I wrote a profile of him that was focused on that point, and not so much about, is there a giant fraud going on? And then, cut to only a few months later, now, FTX had failed. And there were $8 billion missing. And if you're baffled by some of these cryptocurrency terms, it's really, it's not that complicated.\n\nYou can think of FTX as like an e-trade, but instead of buying Apple shares or Exxon, you're buying Bitcoin or Dogecoin, you send them your money. You buy these coins, you trade them. And then later you ask for your money back. And what had happened was that a lot of customers had asked for their money back, they'd found it wasn't there, there were $8 billion missing, it sure looked like a giant fraud had occurred, but Sam Bankman-Fried had yet to be arrested, he was holed up in his penthouse in the Bahamas, and I decided to fly down there and see his side of the story.\n\nBECKER: And what did he tell you? So what was his defense here?\n\nFAUX: So what he said was that, so what had happened was that he had this e-trade, this FTX, and then he also controlled a hedge fund called Alameda Research. And Alameda had borrowed the customer's money from FTX and then gone and gambled it away. They'd spent tons of it on like this real estate spending spree in the Bahamas.\n\nThey'd been giving tons of political donations. They'd been, and it all looked like this had come from customer money. And what Sam told me, which was just truly bizarre. First off, I walk into this this $30 million penthouse, not part of the tour on the first profile, when he was trying to paint this picture of himself as someone who's above caring about things like fancy apartments.\n\nHe famously liked to say he drove a Toyota Corolla and slept on a beanbag at his office.\n\nBECKER: And he was doing it all just to give it away.\n\nFAUX: Yes, so I walk into this penthouse, and the first thing that struck me were the shoes. There were just tons, this giant pile of shoes right at the entrance. And it was that all of these FTX employees, who had lived there, had fled the island in such haste that they left behind all their things.\n\nAnd these are like, young kids who'd moved to, mostly Americans, who'd moved to Hong Kong with him, when he was running his company there, and then to the Bahamas, and when things started to look bad, they'd fled. And some of them had, they'd been in tears, they'd moved back with their parents, it's really, imagine that. Your first job, and then it collapses just like that, it's really, it's really wild to see.\n\nAnd Sam led me into the most modest room of this fancy apartment, and just started talking and going on and on about how he just hadn't been paying attention. He had, he'd lost track. He hadn't done anything intentionally wrong. But none of it seemed very credible to me. Because here's someone who, even if you take him at his word that he was doing it all to give it all away, he's someone who dedicated his life to making a lot of money.\n\nAnd he was basically trying to tell me, \"I wasn't even paying attention to how much I had, I lost track.\" And at one point he said that he'd misplaced $8 billion. And I'm like, \"Are you really telling me you just misplaced $8 billion?\"\n\nBECKER: Billion with a B, we should say.\n\nFAUX: With a B, yeah.\n\nAnd he says to me, \"Misaccounted.\" And he almost sounded like proud of himself with this explanation, but I'm just sitting there in disbelief. I couldn't imagine that this was really the case.\n\nBECKER: And so do you think then, was any of that altruism true? Was that the truth? Did he really start this because he just wanted to amass a large amount of wealth and give it away and quote-unquote, save the world?\n\nWas any of that true and then it just got corrupted? Or what happened?\n\nFAUX: So feel free, you may think that I'm too committed to my original thesis.\n\nBECKER: (LAUGHS)\n\nFAUX: But I actually believe that I spoke with him. I spoke with people who've known him his whole life. Many of his colleagues. These people really were spending all their time thinking about effective altruism, which takes you to some weird places.\n\nThey were thinking about the risk to the world posed by out-of-control AI. Or the next pandemic, and they really thought that by directing their billions to the right causes, they could change the course of human history potentially. And this kind of hubris, I think, made them more dangerous, made them willing to take huge risks.\n\nBecause what's like a little cryptocurrency fraud if you might be able to save the world on the other end?\n\nBECKER: So did they just get corrupted then by the amount of money involved? Or did they just make really bad mistakes and take too many risks? So without getting into all of the boring crypto details, essentially at one point from what I'm told by my sources, Sam and his top lieutenants, other young people like him, they learned in the summer of 2022 that essentially their hedge fund was out of money, and it was time to call it quits. And they had a meeting and decided, \"Hey, should we just admit our failure?\n\nOr, should we dip into these customer funds, take this gamble and maybe we can keep this going.\" And if crypto keeps going up and up, no one will ever know. And from what I was told, they decided to take that gamble. And if that's true, it's a very illegal gamble. And it didn't work out. And now Sam's top lieutenants have all pleaded guilty.\n\nThey're going to be testifying against him. It's going to be a very dramatic trial to see these old friends who conquered the crypto world together. All turning against each other.\n\nBECKER: So let's explain a little bit of the basics for folks who don't understand the crypto world, myself included here.\n\nSo when we're talking about FTX as an exchange, let's explain what that is and what that means in cryptocurrency.\n\nFAUX: If you want to buy a Bitcoin, you have to somehow exchange your real dollars for that Bitcoin. And the place where you do that is called an exchange. And you could do that on a more mainstream app like a Robinhood, or you could go to FTX and it's just like a, it's a user-friendly app.\n\nThat's why they had Tom Brady and Larry David pitching it. You send them money. And then once your money is in the app, you can trade whatever cryptocurrencies you want. And then win or lose, you're going to take it out later. And like I was saying before, you would be very surprised to find the money wasn't there.\n\nYou sent this money to gamble on crypto. And once you have your winnings, you expect them to be available to take out just like at a casino. So I think of them, these crypto exchanges, just like offshore casinos, the reason it was in the Bahamas is that there's a lot of rules around investing in the U.S.\n\nIt didn't follow them, so it was based in the Bahamas where the rules are different.\n\nPart II\n\nBECKER: Zeke, it seems to me a real premise here is you've got to get a lot of people to believe in the value of this currency.\n\nSo it's value will go up. That's essentially what we're talking about, right? Is that how you would describe it?\n\nFAUX: Yeah. So if we roll back two years, when I was getting started in this world, that was the question that I had too. I was like, \"Isn't there, is there something more to this?\"\n\n'Cause I'm hearing about it all over the place. It's practically inescapable. And I didn't really, even as an investigative reporter, I didn't really want to investigate it, because I thought, \"What's to investigate?\" Oh, people just, everyone starts talking about Dogecoin, which for those who aren't educated on this, is a cryptocurrency that's based on a popular picture of a dog.\n\nAnd there's nothing more to it. You go on your Robinhood or FTX, you click buy, and you buy some Dogecoin. No one's promising it even does anything. For a couple years there, prices of Dogecoin and all these other cryptocurrencies were just going up so high that people started talking about it like this might be the future of finance.\n\nAnd I'm just sitting there being like, \"Is this all there is?\" Surely there has to be something to this. Like, all these smart people have been working on this for so many years. They must have some sort of real-world purpose. And I cut to two years later and I find that I'm talking to Sam in his apartment, and I find that in fact, this guy who had been hailed as like the crypto genius, the smartest trader in crypto, himself had totally bought into this thinking. And had made huge bets on things like totally asinine things like Dogecoin or that his supposed giant wealth, a lot of it consisted of stockpiles of totally made-up coins, even ones that he'd made up himself.\n\nAnd it was like this sort of unreality bubble that was created by the numbers, the prices of all these cryptocurrencies going up and up. It just became hard to question. Even the craziest things that all these people are saying.\n\nBECKER: I suppose it's easy to look at it now that there's been such a big fall and say, \"Wow, how did so many people believe that?\"\n\nBut I think, as you mentioned, two years ago, this was a very big deal. I remember, actually, one of my grown children saying he wanted to invest in Bitcoin. I said, \"I don't understand it.\" And I literally said this because I have a drawer of buttons in my house. I said, \"If I convince everyone that my buttons are worth a million dollars, then they are worth a million dollars?\n\nAnd that's Bitcoin.\" And he told me I was being ridiculous, but I still wonder whether that's true now. But also, I just want to point out that in 2021, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, announced that his government was going to be betting on Bitcoin. And we actually have a bit of tape from him at that year's Bitcoin conference with a lot of cheers from crypto enthusiasts about his government's use of Bitcoin.\n\nLet's listen.\n\nNAYIB BUKELE: Next week, I will send to Congress a bill that will make Bitcoin a legal tender in El Salvador. In the short term, this will generate jobs and help provide financial inclusion to thousands outside the formal economy. And in the medium and long term, we hope that this small decision can help us push forward (CHEERS).\n\nBECKER: And following that announcement, the government of El Salvador encouraged businesses to use Bitcoin. Zeke Faux, you traveled to El Salvador. What did you find out there?\n\nFAUX: So I'm just returning to your button story for a minute, it would be hard to sell your buttons for a million dollars.\n\nBut imagine how happy you would be if the government of El Salvador announced that its new currency would be Deborah's buttons, right? That would obviously be very good for the price of, for Deborah's button prices. So that's why these crypto guys were so thrilled that this country announced that it would use Bitcoin as a currency.\n\nAnd people were literally, I was at this conference. People were, it was one of the first ones I went to, people were in tears, and I just, I was like, what is this weird world, and they all said, you got to go to El Salvador, you got to see, it's the future, it's going to help the poor, they're all using Bitcoin. And the listeners are probably asking themselves, \"What does this even mean, how does this make sense?\" And it doesn't make sense. I got there, and one of the first places I went to was this little roadside store.\n\nAnd the president had passed this Bitcoin law, which meant that all businesses were supposed to accept Bitcoin as payment. The country's main currency is the dollar, and they didn't abandon that. But they're supposed to also use Bitcoin. And I went to the store, and I pulled, I grabbed, I asked for a bottle of water.\n\nAnd the clerk gave it to me, so I'm holding the water. And then in my terrible gringo Spanish, I said, \"Puedo pagar con Bitcoin, por favor?\" And the clerk just said, \"Basura!\" Trash! And grabbed the water out of my hand, and just walked away. Get out of here, you dumb tourist. I don't want to use your Bitcoin.\n\nAnd that was the attitude I got all over the place. Despite this huge push from the president, the currency was totally rejected by the people. Stores would only use it begrudgingly. And what using Bitcoin means is that they would have a special payment terminal and I could use an app on my phone to send my Bitcoins to them instead of using my credit card or my dollars, but the terminals never worked right.\n\nThey're very slow on there and people complained. \"Hey, the price of Bitcoin goes up and down a lot. Why would I want to accept that for my surf lesson or to sell you a beer? How about you just give me some dollars?\" So the ones that did accept that it was just as like a courtesy for the annoying Bitcoin tourists, which I became one of.\n\nBECKER: If we go back to the buttons for a minute, the buttons are at least tangible. I understand the use of them, right? I can sew a button on and it will keep clothing together or whatever. But I don't get the, what are you getting here from, how do you explain that to people, what you're getting?\n\nIt's a new currency. And how is it safe? How are these merchants in El Salvador who are not taking Bitcoin because they're skeptical, how do they know that it's safe?\n\nFAUX: You've just made your first mistake with button currency. By giving it a purpose, now it's, we can say, okay, it's only worth like a nickel or something, we need to be like, it's better to never say what it's for, and you can just make it sound like an amazing story that, this is a, who knows what millions of uses it'll have in the future. This is the future of money. The price of buttons is going to the moon.\n\nBitcoin, yes, it isn't anything. And I spent a long time trying to understand how it worked. And honestly, my book is not the one to read if you really want to get into the details of the blockchain and how it works. But I realized that the gist is pretty simple. Essentially there's a database. And column A is a list of people and column B, think of a Google sheet, column B is how much money they have.\n\nAnd the Bitcoin database is maintained collectively by all these computers. And it keeps track of how many people, all the people. And the column B, instead of how many dollars they have, is how many Bitcoin you have. So when I send someone a Bitcoin, they're not receiving anything really tangible. Just we're subtracting one from my line on the database and adding one to their line. And people, even now, people will pay almost 30, 000 to make that happen.\n\nBECKER: Even now.\n\nFAUX: It's wild.\n\nBECKER: So again, I wonder. What do you find to be the, you've written a lot of anecdotes in this book, but what you find to be the, one of the most amazing anecdotes that you find yourself going back to, about getting people to believe in the potential of Bitcoin, let's say that, as its purpose and the reason to get on board?\n\nFAUX: One of my favorite stories, I traveled all around the world for this book, and one of my favorite stories comes from the Philippines, it's about a different cryptocurrency called Smooth Love Potions, which is a pretty silly name, and this was a cryptocurrency that you could earn by playing a mobile game called Axie Infinity, so you played this game on your phone, which it sort of looked like Pok\u00e9mon, except that the creatures were based on these Mexican axolotls, these very cute little monsters.\n\nYou have your team of monsters, and the more you fought in the game, the more Smooth Love Potions you earned. And crypto people were promoting this as not just a fun game, but a new form of work. A way that the world's poor could earn a living. And they said that this was the main example of Web 3, which is supposed to be a way that we would all own our data on the internet, and that we could use it to make money instead of just giving it away for free to the Facebooks and Googles of the world.\n\nSeriously, they said that this game could be a panacea for global poverty and you might be asking, \"Well, why would you want any Smooth Love Potions?\" And the answer is, \"Well, you need them breed your Axie monsters to play the game.\" And then you might say, \"Why do I want any Axie monsters?\" And the reason is you need them to earn the Smooth Love Potions. So like it never made any sense. But it totally took off in the Philippines. At its peak, there were maybe a million people playing it.\n\nWhole families were out of work because of the pandemic, and they were just playing Axie all day. And the price of Smooth Love Potions actually got pretty high, to the point that you could earn several, like a living wage, for a few months there, just clicking buttons on your phone and having these Axies play each other.\n\nBECKER: Because you would get a cut of the volume of people playing. In a way.\n\nFAUX: Yeah the game just kept making more and more Smooth Love Potions, and as long as there were new people coming in to buy the love potions to make the monsters. They had some value. But of course this whole thing collapsed. And I went out there to see it for myself and to meet some of the people who had invested in this, and I saw it as a test case for what the vision of the future that the crypto people were promoting.\n\nBECKER: And all of these people lost money.\n\nFAUX: Some people did okay because they had been working as hired game players, like they would be almost like renting monsters from others and earning an hourly wage for playing. But other people had borrowed lots of money to buy their monsters, because the price of the monsters got to be pretty high, like a team might be a thousand dollars.\n\nThey would borrow money thinking they could earn a living from this. And my cab driver said that he had lost $2,100 that he borrowed from his wife's sisters. And, this was so significant to him that he was contemplating suicide. And he said that he'd just been addicted to this game.\n\nHe was convinced it was the way he was going to earn his way to his financial goals. And when the thing collapsed, he was devastated. I talked with another woman who lived in a sort of shanty town in Manila, and she'd borrowed $1,500 from her mother. She still checked the price of Smooth Love Potions all the time on a cryptocurrency exchange like FTX where you could buy and sell them.\n\nBecause she was really hoping they'd come back up, but she'd lost so much money that she and her husband were considering leaving their small children with her parents and moving abroad to Dubai to find new jobs. And this all had collapsed, well before FTX, but it was memory hold by the crypto world. And I had wondered, would they adapt their products?\n\nWould they change because of this Axie collapse? And instead, all I saw, again and again, was people promoting new schemes that were similar. And so it seemed like so much of these cryptocurrencies were really like totally unsustainable bubbles at best.\n\nBECKER: And yet they kept attracting people.\n\nAnd the games would just evolve, the currencies would just evolve, the exchanges would just evolve. And we should say that the whole reason really you started writing about this was because of another exchange called Tether. And you describe Tether as the molten core, right?\n\nOf all of this. And it is actually supposed to be a stable coin that's matched dollar for dollar with the U. S. dollar, right?\n\nFAUX: Yeah. So this was a kind of mystery that I felt like I could really dig into. Tether, you can think of it as the central bank of crypto. And the major players in crypto use it to move their money around. And Tether tokens are supposed to always be worth a dollar because they're backed by real dollars in a bank somewhere.\n\nBut when I started out two years ago, there were about 50 billion Tether tokens in circulation, which meant that Tether was supposed to have 50 billion real dollars somewhere.\n\nThey weren't saying exactly where. There are a lot of rumors flying about whether that money was real or not. And there was so much concern about this that Janet Yellen had called a meeting of all of the top financial regulators, their meeting in Washington, D.C. to discuss Tether and whether it posed a risk to the global financial system.\n\nAnd now as I started researching this, it just started to seem silly to me. One of the founders of the coin was a child actor from The Mighty Ducks. The guy running the company.\n\nBECKER: The Disney movie.\n\nFAUX: Yes he plays the coach in a flashback, misses a penalty shot. And the guy running the company had never given an interview.\n\nHe was a former plastic surgeon from Italy. The CEO on paper was seen so little in public, people wondered if he existed, and the company wasn't even really based anywhere in the world.\n\nFAUX: So I'm like, how did this get so big? Why are concerns about this silly coin dreamed up by The Mighty Ducks guy reaching the highest levels of the U.S. government?\n\nWhere's this $50 billion? And it was just like this irresistible mystery that sucked me into the crypto world.\n\nBECKER: And where's the money?\n\nFAUX: The search took me a lot of weird places by the end, I was in Cambodia, looking into crypto fueled human trafficking and Chinese gangsters using Tether to run these multinational scams.\n\nSearching for this money was like the craziest adventure I've been on in my career.\n\nBECKER: And did you ever get a satisfactory answer?\n\nFAUX: Even as, in the summer of 2022, Crypto companies started collapsing one after another, and FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried came in November, a few months after the market really fell.\n\nAnd this whole time, a lot of people who were suspicious of Tether were watching and saying, \"This is going to be the time that if Tether doesn't really have the money, it's going to be revealed.\"\n\nBECKER: Okay, you're going to have to tell us. We're going to find out where the money was revealed after a break.\n\nPart III\n\nBECKER: Zeke, before the break, you were talking about how you got interested in writing about the cryptocurrency world and your look at the exchange called Tether, and whether Tether actually had stored the assets that it claimed to have stored. So can you tell us what you found out?\n\nFAUX: So now Tether has grown even bigger than ever. It seems it survived the collapse that destroyed so many other crypto companies. And if you believe their numbers, they now have $80 billion.\n\nAnd because interest rates have risen in general, the company, which is a tiny operation, can invest that money in relatively and totally safe U.S. treasuries. And earn 5% a year. So these, the people that run it, like this former plastic surgeon, are now billionaires. They came out the winners of this crypto collapse.\n\nBECKER: You had difficulty finding this. You mentioned Janet Yellen. But we're talking about billions of dollars. At the same time that words are coming out of your mouth, like buying Monsters and Mighty Ducks and things that just don't seem to all often go together. Let's just put it that way.\n\nSo what do you make of this? And why do so many people believe that this is safe? Why do companies like Tether continue to survive, perhaps even thrive, despite these things when there doesn't appear to be any sort of regulatory safety going on?\n\nFAUX: So I think that during this bubble, like if you were interested in getting in crypto, whether it's Tether or Smooth Love Potions, or trading on FTX or whatever, most people, they weren't really true believers.\n\nIt was more that they heard their neighbor had made a lot of money on Bitcoin and renovated their kitchen, the one that happened to me. And they're not thinking, \"I'm getting in early on the future of finance by buying Dogecoin.\" They're thinking, \"I'm smart. I'll buy Dogecoin. I'm early, I'm going to buy it now. Other people are going to get in later, the price will go up, and I'll get out, while the getting is good, and I'm going to make a lot of money.\"\n\nAnd the problem is that just can't be, it doesn't work for everybody, it can't be true for everybody.\n\nBECKER: Somebody's left holding the bag, right?\n\nFAUX: Yeah, and there's a Wall Street guy who got into crypto, named Mike Novogratz, and early on he said, \"This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes, prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be.\n\nYou can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.\" And, he did, he made a lot of money. And so did a lot of other people who got in early. But, if you're like me, by the time you hear about something, it's probably too late, it's probably the real smart money was in at the beginning, they're the people who created these coins, and, if you're coming in at the end, by the time you're coming in, it's closer to the end than the beginning, and you're more likely to be the bag holder.\n\nBECKER: Right? Because you're making the money at the expense of others. Many people who probably, can't afford to lose their retirement savings to this.\n\nFAUX: Yes. I spoke to teachers, factory workers, students, people around the world who had sunk their money into crypto.\n\nWhether it was because of FOMO or whether they really thought this was safe and a good way to invest. And people lost real money. It changed their lives. They've had to put off buying houses or going to, paying for college. It truly was, caused a lot of harm. And it's not just people who had their money at FTX.\n\nAlthough, definitely those people too, even people who bet on crypto and won, if they happen to have their money at one of the many crypto companies that failed, now it's gone. It was a lot of fun while everything was going up and up. I certainly felt a tinge of sadness that I wasn't getting rich off Dogecoin myself.\n\nBut now that the whole thing has collapsed, it's hard to see the appeal.\n\nBECKER: Yet Tether is still thriving.\n\nFAUX: Yeah, no, one of the reasons I found that some people use Tether is that it can be used for illicit activities. So the one I mentioned in Cambodia is a kind of scam called pig butchering.\n\nThis is like a totally crazy story that you'll have to read about, but it would essentially, these scam, these spam text messages that we all get, they're meant to lure people into crypto scams, which happen to be run by often Chinese gangsters who are based in other countries in Southeast Asia.\n\nI spoke to one crypto tracing expert who estimated that $10 billion had been lost to these crypto scams. People really get these spam messages and then are convinced to send hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars to scammers who say, \"Hey, I've got this great trick for trading crypto.\n\nWouldn't you want to get rich?\"\n\nAnd I bet they're having a harder time now, but during the bubble, that was a pretty good pitch. We all knew people who had made a lot of money on crypto, and hey this kind stranger who sent me a message about whether I bought dog food on the way home seems to have the secret for me.\n\nWhy don't I give it a try?\n\nBECKER: I wonder, do you think, Ponzi schemes have been around for a long time. Scammers have been around for a long time. Certainly not to this scale, but is there something different about what's happening culturally right now? Why does it seem that this has been allowed to grow to the level that it has been able to?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nFAUX: To me, first off, a lot of people in crypto genuinely believe in it. And they got caught up in the hype like anybody else. And if you had some idea for a new app or something, wouldn't you be excited that everybody would, wanted to buy in? And even if prices got really high, I don't know that I would have the self-control to say, \"Hey, don't invest in my coin.\n\nIt's gone up too high,\" or something like that. But for the scammers, there were just so many people ignoring so many securities laws. It was almost like a January 6th riot of securities violations. There's, the cops don't even know where to start. And I think that they're going to be, with these cryptocurrencies, it made it so easy to start a new investment scheme.\n\nIt's the authorities are going to be like digging through these companies for years to come, trying to see if they violated the laws that have protected investors for almost 100 years and in traditional markets.\n\nBECKER: I wonder, there is a story in the book that I wonder if you could briefly tell about NFTs, which are part of this whole world.\n\nFirst explain what it is and why you actually bought one? Because that part of the book made me a little nervous.\n\nFAUX: Yeah, I was very nervous too, but if you really want to try out crypto, just sending your money to an exchange and trading it is not really, there's nothing that crypto-y about that.\n\nThe appeal of crypto is that you could, it could, it's decentralized and you could control your coins yourself in on your wallet and there'd be no need for a bank or an exchange or some sort of intermediary to help you handle your money.\n\nSo many people told me I should check this out. I decided to do it. One of the people who teased me about how I hadn't tried it was trying to get me to buy into his club, which was called Solana Monkey Business. And in order to join this club, you had to buy this NFT, which is a kind of crypto token, for $25,000.\n\nBECKER: Non fungible.\n\nFAUX: Non fungible token. It's like digital art. What it essentially boils down to, often, are like these ugly cartoons that cost thousands of dollars. I decided if I was going to join one of these clubs to buy one of these NFTs, I wanted the one that celebrities have. That's called the Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nIt's been promoted by Jimmy Fallon, Paris Hilton, Brady, Tom Brady had one, Justin Bieber. It was really, it was a trend in Hollywood and in sports for a while. And people, once you bought one, you could make it your profile picture. And they went for as much as, $500,000, a million dollars at the time.\n\nI decided I was going to try it out. I sat my wife down one night after the kids were in bed. And I was like, \"Nikki, I got to talk to you about something for the book.\" And I explained this whole thing about the Bored Ape Yacht Club and they were having a party. And you had to come, it was headlined by Snoop and Eminem.\n\nIt's going to be a weeklong festival; you needed an ape to come. I told her this would be great material for the book, but it's expensive. And she's like, \"How much are we talking?\" And I said, the cheapest ones, which are these ape derivatives, they're like these kind of ugly, even uglier, melted apes, were going for $40,000.\n\nThat's what it's going to be. She was totally horrified, but she was very supportive of the project. I explained that I didn't intend to lose this money, hopefully I could sell my mutant ape and recover it. And she said, \"That does sound like good material for the book, give it a try.\"\n\nAnd I found it actually a lot more educational than I expected. Because, when I went to go buy this ape, alright, first off, the price had gone down to, by the time I got around to it, the price was down to $20,000, which was cool because I didn't want to spend $40,000, but also bad because it showed that the price could go from $40,000 to $20,000 really fast.\n\nBECKER: For a digital cartoon of an ape.\n\nFAUX: Yes.\n\nBECKER: Okay. This is a picture, just to make clear.\n\nFAUX: The one I got, it's orange, it's just like a pretty simple cartoon of a melted ape smoking a pipe with a sweater. Made of maggots.\n\nBECKER: And okay. And the only way we can buy this digital ape is with crypto.\n\nFAUX: Yeah. And this is, I had spent so long looking into this, but then I started to actually do it. I had to learn how to send my money into crypto land. And what it boiled down to is, in your web browser, there's the place where you type the URL, and then maybe you've got a little red icon next to that for the ad block.\n\nNow, I installed one that was a picture of a fox, and now my money would live in the picture of the fox. And, before I installed the picture of the fox icon, I had to watch a video, in which they instructed me that if I made any typos, or lost the password, my $20,000 would be gone. And that I should engrave the password on a metal plate, and bury it in my backyard.\n\nWhich I did not do, despite their instructions. And I'd never been so happy to get a call from Bank of America customer service. I was trying to wire the $20,000 to a crypto exchange. It's a very convoluted process and this friendly rep said, \"Zeke like we see you're trying to wire Money to buy crypto, this is often a scam.\n\nYou might be getting scammed right now. Are you sure that you want us to?\" And I was just like, \"Oh, thank you traditional financial system. So very, so nice of, so thoughtful of you to check out my transactions and call me. Representative I am being scammed and please put it through I need to buy my ugly cartoon monkey.\" So yes, I acquired this mutant ape. I went to Ape Fest, and what I found was first off, the idea of owning one of these is supposed to be this big flex, impress everybody, but my friends and family were just, they just thought I was stupid for buying the ape.\n\nAnd I sent it to my mom, I sent the picture of the ape, and then she just sent it back to me. She said, \"It's my ape now.\" And, I was like, \"No mom, this is the future of art. I own this ape on the blockchain. I can't really explain how I own it, but I do own it. Even though you have the exact same picture on your phone now.\n\nI'm the only one who paid $20,000 for it. It's not yours.\" But that wasn't very satisfying. And then at ApeFest, the other ape people, they would pretend to be nice, but I could see what they were thinking. They all were like, \"This is the worst Ape I've ever seen.\" Even pimply teenagers would be like, \"My ape cost a million dollars.\n\nYou're a loser. You barely got into this party.\" It didn't serve its purpose. And the whole time I had it, I was just terrified. Even though I could see that every day people were buying and selling these apes, I just had this feeling that no one will ever, I would be the last sucker to pay $20,000 for the cartoon monkey.\n\nNo one will take it off my hands.\n\nBECKER: Okay, did you get your money back?\n\nFAUX: Someone did buy it. I was very happy, very relieved. I lost about $2,000, mostly on transaction fees.\n\nYou think crypto is pitched as this great easier, faster, cheaper way to move money around. But in my experience, I always got hit with a ton of fees.\n\nAt least like $1,000 in fees on selling this ape. But I've never been so relieved to lose $2,000. I was just glad that nobody stole it. And that I got most of the money back.\n\nBECKER: We have just a couple of minutes left, and I think I want to end with the question of, \"Is there use for crypto?\"\n\nIs there really solid, legit use, are we just figuring our way to a new world of finance or currencies or whatever here? Or has this just been one big experiment that hasn't gone that well? How would you describe it?\n\nFAUX: You can hear a lot of ideas about crypto that sound totally convincing for a minute or even like an hour or two, but I think we can only really judge it by what it's done so far.\n\nAnd Bitcoin's as old as Uber. It's as old as WhatsApp and ask yourself, have you ever used it for anything? Do you know anyone who's ever used it for anything? And if the only good use that crypto had come up with, was it was this fun thing you could gamble on at these offshore casinos. Now, some of those casinos have been revealed to be frauds.\n\nPeople have lost all their money and it's not even fun thing to gamble on anymore.\n\nBECKER: So basically, no. No use.\n\nFAUX: I see it as like a crazy moment in history, a mania, the likes of which we'll never see again."

The cryptocurrency is widely considered a pure play on liquidity and is more sensitive to changes in interest-rate expectations than equities are."

        "content": "There may be over 10 financial giants filing to launch a Bitcoin ETF, but according to one analyst, BlackRock's application may be the one to watch.\n\nIn a CNBC video released Monday, Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman called BlackRock's filing \"much more important\" than the other prospective offerings. To date, other applicants include Fidelity, Digital Currency Group, and most recently Franklin Templeton, which joined the race just last week.\n\n\"If Blackrock has an ETF, you know that they are going to win. They have the marketing and distribution to put new people into Bitcoin,\" Dorman said.\n\nAccording to the CNBC, BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management firms, has been closely monitoring the cryptocurrency market for some time, even quietly exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its investment strategies.\n\nThis prospective move by BlackRock could signal a major vote of confidence in the cryptocurrency and might encourage other institutional investors to follow suit.\n\nElsewhere in the video, experts shed light on how a spot Bitcoin ETF could provide traditional investors with a regulated and accessible gateway into the cryptocurrency market. Experts believe that once the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF, it will likely attract a broad spectrum of investors, from retail traders to institutional players, who have been waiting for a regulated vehicle to enter the crypto space.\n\nAlready, Bitcoin Futures ETFs are publicly traded, though these funds notably do not buy or sell Bitcoin on the open market.\n\nFinally, the experts noted Bitcoin's broader narrative as a decentralized digital currency and store of value, as well as how the upcoming halving, in which the rewards Bitcoin pays out to the miners that secure the protocol will be reduced, could put a positive pressure on its price dynamics.\n\nTaken together, the CNBC report was confident enough to declare a \"next bull market\" may soon be in store.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Remains Above $27K as Fed Not Likely to Close the Door on Rate Hikes: Analyst - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Us, traders are anticipating no change in rates as the Federal Open Markets Committee two day meeting kicks off today. Joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is Forex dot com. Global head of research, Matt Welner. Good morning, Matt. Hey Martin, thanks for having me on. So I assume you are with the vast majority of humanity that thinks that there will be no change in rates today uh this week. But uh do you see uh at least even a potential for another sad 25 basis points uh increase before the end of the year just because? Yeah, absolutely. I, I do not think we should close the door on rate hikes and I do not expect the Federal Reserve tomorrow to close the door on rate hikes. In fact, I expect the median dot in their dot plot where they forecast where interest rates and other economic variables will be that could well still signal another interest rate hike. Probably in the December time frame. Inflation continues to remain above expectations. So right now, it's a good opportunity for the fed to, to sort of sit on their hands, be data dependent as they've argued they have been for, for years now and uh see if that data continues to support another rate hike. But if we just take a step back, the broader trend is the fact that we're nearing people interest rates really across the globe. We might see one more rate hike in England. We might see one in Switzerland this week. But at the end of the day, we're, we're probably one and done in a lot of these countries and that, that peak interest rate phenomenon and the potential for future rate cuts is something that could be supportive of the crypto asset markets as we move into 2024 and beyond. Yeah, that, that has to do, of course, with the idea that uh if rates stay the same or even lower, it makes it easier for uh people to take on risk and, and the cost of borrowing if, if rates fall uh becomes cheaper and they could take on leverage. But something interesting happened yesterday. We had a, we, we had this flash sell off if you will. Um And I'm wondering how much of that it, it, it doesn't seem at least to be based on macro issues, but it does. Do you think that it was specifically related? I don't know, I wanna say potentially Binance, it could well be um this is something that perhaps is of most interest to very short term traders. It, it, it was a, a big drop. On a short term basis. But I, if we take a step back again, we're still in that broader range. As the chart shows, we're, we're finding a lot of support around 25 K. We're finding resistance up at 32 K. We dropped from the mid 20 sevens, I believe in this, this flash crash back down to 27 K or so. And we're, we're sort of in no man's land in the middle of that range. I would say if we can get sustainably above 28 K that opens up the highs of the year near 32 K. Meanwhile, if this 25 K range breaks, which is certainly a possibility, especially if central banks do start to squeeze in a couple last rate hikes, maybe we'll, we'll see some downside toward 24 K. But uh the short term outlook is very much range bound. II, I guess my question has to do is I, I mean, are there any structural issues that the market seems to be concerned about? I, I think it, I think it all relates back to the macro environment. It's just much less favorable than it has been for the entirety of Bitcoin's life and uh Ethereum and all the other crypto assets. We, we were in essentially a 0% interest rate regime for almost that entire period. Now, we have to see how these assets perform in a higher interest rate uh regime and And frankly, I think some of the performance we've seen this year from Bitcoin and Ethereum and other crypto assets has sort of, um, uh, put to rest, some concerns that it was solely a low interest rate phenomenon. We're still seeing decent performance, uh, at least prices holding up despite the high interest rates. And I think that's something that's very bullish long term. Is there anything interesting going on in the market besides Bitcoin? Well, there's always interesting stuff going on. I think we, we're still in that sort of, uh, maybe, uh crypto spring period. Everyone talks about a crypto winter. We've certainly seen a bounce back in prices, but there's a lot of building underneath the surface. Um, if we're talking about Bitcoin, some of the things like ordinals and inscriptions are, are essentially types of NFTS almost on Bitcoin that I think has, uh, provided a bit of a lift to the crypto asset. And of course, in Ethereum and other smart contracts, we see, uh, apps being built gaming, I think is, is an area that got overhyped a couple of years ago but is starting to find a little bit of product market fit. So, uh, it, it's, it, nothing is really broken through to the mass consumer adoption stage, but we're, we're sort of in that period of the cycle and there's certainly some green shoots that, uh, that I think we, we should keep our eyes on to see if something starts to get momentum uh whether that could help lead us to the next stage in, in a new uh crypto bowl cycle. Matt. Let's take a look at this chart on Bitcoin dominance. It shows it's at 50% and still trending higher unpack what we're seeing here. Yeah, of course. So Bitcoin dominance is just the proportion of the total crypto market cap. Uh uh Bitcoin makes up it historically, it was very high when crypto, when Bitcoin was the only crypto asset, uh it, it dropped very low. I I in bull markets as traders kind of invest in higher volatility, riskier alt coins that are seeing bigger returns. The key thing to watch with this chart moving forward is the fact that Bitcoin dominance tends to trend higher in bear markets. And and we are seeing Bitcoin dominance trending higher, in fact is right about at 50% after getting as low as below 40%. Uh it uh in the in the peak bull market period. So what traders will be looking at to sort of signal the the next leg higher in crypto assets as a whole would actually be Bitcoin dominance falling. That indicates that investors in the space are feeling more optimistic, get optimistic, more uh eager to take on risk and buying what's a little bit further out on the risk curve. Of course, all of this is pretty far out uh relative to traditional investments. But if you start to move towards some of those alt coins. That's when we see Bitcoin dominance rolling over. And that's when we can really see, uh of course, Bitcoins still rising, maybe not as fast as small coins, but that's really what investors will be looking to see uh for the next full, you know, 111 thing that we've, uh you know, a, a common theme that a few of our guests have had is that the, this kind of seems to be the apocalypse, which is a term that I brought up yesterday that there are fundamental issues that are involved, which uh is scaring people away from the alt it. Do, do you think that that's going to affect Bitcoin dominance in a different way? I mean, I mean, you know, you talk about risk on, risk off or increased appetite for risk would put people into all. But uh doesn't that hurdle rate get higher and higher? Uh actually, because of the fundamentals behind the adoption of all coins and people just saying, you know what, I'm not getting anything out of this. Why do I need this? Is that, does that kind of change that equation a bit? I, I think it, it, it's a, a savvy observation. I, I think a lot of it relates again to that macro environment where previously we had 0% interest rates, we had venture capitalists eager to spray money at anything having to do with crypto and, and getting again themselves further out on the risk curve. Now we're in a more reserved environment and I think that's going to take some of those long tail assets and, and just frankly make them not, not investable and, and not at a stage where they can start to get some momentum. But uh alt coins is a very broad topic. I do think uh some of the smart contract platforms obviously ethereum, things like solana and avalanche are getting some traction. So I, I think there's certain um chains, coins tokens that have made it over the threshold, but certainly to your point, it's gonna be uh I think a lot more difficult for things to come out of nowhere and get a lot of sustainable momentum and be, be uh tokens that we're talking about in the next cycle and beyond Matt, what are the whales doing? Are you doing any whale watching? How important is it to watch these big wallets? Uh When it comes to what's going on in the markets? Yes, it's absolutely essential what I like to look at, especially when it comes to Bitcoin are long term holders. Um different providers uh define this in different ways. But essentially, uh the, the numbers show if, if someone's held Bitcoin for about half of a year, that indicates they're not a trader, they're not trying to flip it for quick profits. And a lot of times those are the coins that, that essentially go into the cold storage and are never seen again. And uh that figure, if you look at Bitcoin long term holders is actually a approaching its highest level ever as a proportion of total supply near 75%. I think this is a potentially bullish sign and, and something we frequently see before uh big bullish moves because again, that that creates the environment for a supply shock. So if there is a catalyst that has traders rushing to buy Bitcoin, essentially, there's a much smaller proportion of that that's really liquid and available. And that can really juice prices. Again, if there's any sort of catalyst that causes demand to pick up, Matt, thank you very much for joining us this morning and providing that insight. My pleasure. Thank you. That was Forex dot com, Global Head of Research, Matt Weller."

        "title": "Bitcoin miners seek alternative energy sources to cut costs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "During the 2021 bull market, many large mining companies took on massive loans to buy equipment and the proper infrastructure required to mine cryptocurrency. Yet the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and Celsius left many of these companies filing for bankruptcy.\n\nThe current bear market, coupled with high Bitcoin network hash rates and low profits, has yet again left the crypto industry wondering if miners will be able to recover from losses. While this remains questionable, it\u2019s become evident that mining companies today are focusing more on alternative energy resources to cut costs, ensure profits and, in some cases, reduce their environmental impact.\n\nAlternative energy sources used by miners\n\nSteven Lubka, managing director for Bitcoin-focused financial services company Swan Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph that while the average rate to mine a single Bitcoin (BTC) is around $26,000, mining companies focused on renewable energy sources are seeing rates between $5,000 and $15,000 per BTC.\n\nA spokesperson for Riot Blockchain, a United States-based publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, told Cointelegraph that wind and solar energy generated across Texas has helped Riot ensure some of the lowest costs to mine crypto. \u201cAs stated in our Q2 investor deck, it costs Riot $8,389 to mine 1 Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nAerial view of Riot Blockchain's Rockdale mining site. Source: Riot Blockchain\n\nKent Halliburton, president and chief operating officer of Sazmining \u2014 a hosted Bitcoin mining provider \u2014 told Cointelegraph that the biggest expense for mining has always been electricity:\n\n\u201cBitcoin miners are naturally incentivized to find the lowest-cost power. Excess electricity is the lowest priced. With renewables, there is often excess electricity, which makes it a perfect fit for Bitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nHalliburton added that independently sourced data from the Bitcoin Mining Council shows that the Bitcoin network may indeed be one of the most sustainable industries. According to the source, 59% of mining operations are carbon-free and growing at a rate of nearly 4.5% per year.\n\n\u201cAll of our mining operations in Wisconsin and Paraguay are utilizing excess hydroelectricity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shift to alternative energy sources seems to be a trend for miners thinking about long-term success. Phil Harvey, CEO of crypto mining infrastructure provider Sabre56, told Cointelegraph that the company is currently working with dozens of mining companies to get machines set up across Sabre56\u2019s three facilities located in Wyoming and Ohio.\n\nSaber56's Bonepile site in Gillette, Wyoming. Source: Rachel Wolfson\n\nHarvey explained that Sabre56\u2019s facility in Gillette, Wyoming \u2014 known as \u201cBonepile\u201d \u2014 hosts nearly 2,200 mining machines that are powered by a combination of energy sources, including a material contribution from renewable energy. The 5,200-square-foot site draws on Basin Electric\u2019s mixed energy portfolio. According to Basin Electric\u2019s website, this includes 24% wind, 0.6% recovered energy and 4.3% hydro, which adds up to 28.9% renewables.\n\nHarvey said, \u201cThe machines at our Bonepile site consist of a mixture of MicroBT Whatsminer M50s and Bitmain Antminer S19s. In terms of the site design and methodology, we leverage a forced-air design, meaning air is forced into the facility to cool the machines.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harvey, the Bonepile facility is designed to ensure surplus air provision. Harvey explained that this method reduces overheating and strain on the mining equipment while also allowing the miners to naturally exhaust hot air through overpressure.\n\n\u201cThis is different from the standard design widespread in the mining industry, which is often extracting the hot air with an additional mechanism while not having a system in place to aid air into the facility,\u201d he remarked.\n\nOceanBit, a company developing renewable energy platforms using ocean thermal sources, is taking a different approach. Michael Bennett, co-founder of OceanBit, told Cointelegraph that the company is integrating Bitcoin mining into its ocean thermal energy power plant design. \u201cThis will allow us to balance variable loads, deliver power faster to offshore operations, and monetize excess energy to improve plant profitability,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to Bennett, ocean thermal energy is the largest untapped energy source on the planet. \u201cIt\u2019s a base load source of renewable energy, like hydro or geothermal, but uses the temperature difference in ocean water to generate electricity.\u201d\n\nBennett believes Bitcoin is the missing piece needed to scale the energy source to global adoption since it solves a number of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) commercial challenges.\n\nDiagram of OceanBit's thermodynamic cycle. Source: OceanBit\n\nNathaniel Harmon, co-founder and CEO of OceanBit, elaborated, \u201cThe byproduct of OTEC generation process is four degrees Celsius cold water, which makes it ideal for cooling ASICs, while the byproduct of ASICs is low grade heat, which makes it ideal to use in the OTEC process. The combination increases the efficiency while decreasing the cost of both.\u201d\n\nBennett shared that OceanBit plans to unveil its R&D power plant in Hawaii in 2024.\n\nSome alternative energy sources are controversial\n\nPennsylvanian crypto mining company Stronghold Digital Mining is using coal refuse to power its mining operations.\n\nThis refuse \u2014 also known as gob, culm or boney \u2014 is the result of the refining process of coal mining. These unrefined bits of coal mixed with shale, slate or other impurities are piled on thousands of acres of abandoned mine lands in Pennsylvania.\n\nGreg Beard, CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining, told Cointelegraph that his firm is working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and local environmental authorities to clean up piles of waste coal and use them to power Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nHe said, \u201cAcid mine drainage from these piles is one of the largest sources of water pollution in Pennsylvania. The waste piles have also been catching fire for decades by way of spontaneous combustion, releasing toxic pollution into the air. Stronghold converts the coal refuse into power by way of specialized facilities and then either supplies the power to the local grid or uses the power to mine Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is required to continue the waste coal cleanup activities, making it a much more efficient operation than miners seeking out power sources,\u201d added Beard.\n\nWhile this does provide a method of cleaning up the tons of coal refuse, from an environmental perspective, it also poses something of a Catch 22.\n\nThe special plants that can use refuse coal are still burning hydrocarbons. The Pennsylvania arm of the Energy Justice Network project has even contended that refuse coal-firing plants pollute more than new coal plants.\n\nStronghold itself further came under the scrutiny of environmental groups when it applied for a permit to burn tire-derived fuel at its Panther Creek plant.\n\nClean Air Council activist Russell Zerbo recently said on a podcast that the plant \u201cuses the electricity it produces to generate cryptocurrency; rather than selling that electricity to the energy grid, the plant should be completely repermitted as a solid waste incinerator that would be subject to increased air pollution monitoring requirements.\u201d\n\nChallenges for miners may hamper adoption\n\nWhile it\u2019s notable that crypto mining companies are using alternative energy sources, certain challenges could hamper adoption. Halliburton claimed that misinformation regarding alternative energy sources is common:\n\n\u201cLocal populaces may throw-up roadblocks because they don\u2019t realize that Bitcoin miners are providing a net benefit to their local communities through job creation and monetizing wasted or excess electricity. Electricity is also misunderstood; it\u2019s extremely expensive to store, and if electricity is not utilized or stored when it\u2019s generated, it gets wasted \u2014 quite literally put into the earth.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the challenges that come along with using renewable energy are also evident. Harvey mentioned that the altitude of Gillette, Wyoming results in much thinner air quality. As such, the machines at Sabre56\u2019s Bonepile facility can struggle with pulling in enough air required for cooling.\n\nThen comes the challenge of thermal pollution, as hot air is released into the atmosphere from the mining machines, which Cointelegraph witnessed firsthand at the Bonepile site in Wyoming. Given this, some mining companies are finding unique ways to reuse heat production. For instance, Genesis Digital Assets uses hot air produced by mining equipment to grow vegetables in the Nordic regions.\n\nHeat from mining machines is used to grow plants inside a greenhouse. Source: Genesis Digital Assets\n\nAll things considered, the future of mining operations will likely rely on renewable sources. Margie Feng, head of marketing at Bitmain \u2014 a leading producer of crypto mining equipment \u2014 told Cointelegraph that the company has shifted gears and is currently working hard on promoting hydro-cooling technologies, as she believes that demands for this type of equipment will only grow in the future.\n\nFeng added that Bitmain has found that almost a quarter of all Bitcoin miners use water to power their setups, while wind and nuclear are the second- and third-biggest contributions, respectively."

        "title": "Reasons for Another Bitcoin Bull Run - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency aficionados and investors have been keenly following the moves of Bitcoin, the digital currency market's pioneer and bellwether. Bitcoin is displaying symptoms of a potential bull run after seeing unprecedented price rises and subsequent falls over the years. We examine the main causes for the renewed interest in Bitcoin, as well as the variables that may contribute to another large price gain.\n\nAdoption in Institutions\n\nThe increased institutional use of cryptocurrencies is one of the key drivers of Bitcoin's recent recovery. Institutional investors, such as hedge funds, asset managers, and publicly traded firms, have begun putting money into Bitcoin. The bitcoin market gains credibility and legitimacy as a result of this institutional involvement.\n\nHigh-profile endorsements and investments from firms such as Tesla and Square have gotten a lot of attention in the media, helping to shift the perception of cryptocurrencies from speculative assets to real stores of value and investment options. Institutional participation frequently results in increased liquidity and stability in the bitcoin market, which might attract more investors.\n\nFactors Affecting the Economy at Large\n\nGlobal macroeconomic factors have played a critical role in driving Bitcoin interest. Uncertainty in traditional financial markets has encouraged investors to seek alternative assets for diversification and as a hedge against inflation, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 epidemic and accompanying economic stimulus measures.\n\nBitcoin, also known as \"digital gold,\" is considered as a safe haven asset by certain investors, analogous to physical gold. Because Bitcoin has a fixed number of 21 million coins, it is resistant to inflationary pressures, this belief has gained popularity during times of economic crisis and currency devaluation.\n\nInstitutional Infrastructure Development\n\nWith the creation of institutional-grade infrastructure, the bitcoin ecosystem has evolved dramatically over the last few years. The addition of Bitcoin futures contracts on regulated exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has made it easier for institutional investors to obtain exposure to Bitcoin while remaining compliant with regulatory regulations.\n\nIn addition to futures contracts, the emergence of cryptocurrency custodial services, over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, and cryptocurrency-focused investment funds has made institutional entry into the market more convenient and secure. These advances have lowered the entry hurdles for large investors, contributing to the overall expansion of the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nScarcity and Event Halving\n\nThe scarcity of Bitcoin is a key driver of its value. Bitcoin is supposed to be deflationary, with a maximum supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity is exacerbated by Bitcoin halving occurrences, which occur about every four years. During a halving event, the rewards for validating transactions are cut in half, lowering the rate at which new Bitcoins enter the market.\n\nBitcoin halving events have often accompanied large price gains. The slowing of new supply, along with rising demand, causes a supply-demand mismatch that can drive up prices. The most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in May 2020, and the market is currently feeling the effects of its effects on supply dynamics.\n\nAcceptance and Awareness in the Mainstream\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general have garnered considerable acceptance and recognition in the mainstream. Cryptocurrency developments are constantly covered by major financial news sites, and significant players in the financial and technology industries freely discuss and invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis enhanced visibility and awareness benefits retail investor participation. As more individuals become interested in cryptocurrencies, a natural flood of new investors occurs, which can fuel demand and contribute to price momentum upward.\n\nTechnological Advances\n\nThe blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, is constantly evolving and improving. Increased scalability, security, and efficiency have resulted from technological advancements in the bitcoin field. Layer 2 alternatives, like as the Lightning Network, seek to overcome Bitcoin's scaling issues by enabling faster and less expensive transactions.\n\nSecurity improvements, such as hardware wallets and multi-signature authentication, have made Bitcoin a more secure asset for investors. These technological improvements boost confidence in Bitcoin's long-term viability and appeal as a digital asset.\n\nClarity in Regulation\n\nWhile regulatory ambiguity has been a source of concern in the cryptocurrency industry, there have been some encouraging developments in terms of regulatory clarity in a number of places. Some countries have enacted explicit legislation controlling the usage and trading of cryptocurrencies, providing businesses and investors with a stable legal framework.\n\nThis regulatory clarity may entice institutional investors who need clear standards to meet legal and compliance needs. It also encourages the growth of cryptocurrency-related businesses and services, which helps to legitimize the market.\n\nEcosystem of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nThe rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has fueled interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Users of DeFi platforms can earn interest, lend, borrow, and trade digital assets without the use of traditional financial intermediaries.\n\nMany DeFi applications are developed on Bitcoin-compatible blockchain systems, allowing users to use Bitcoin as collateral for a variety of financial services inside the DeFi ecosystem. The incorporation of Bitcoin into DeFi enhances its utility beyond that of a store of value and presents it as an asset capable of generating passive income.\n\nBitcoin Surges Beyond $27,000 Ahead of Fed Meeting: What's Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally?\n\nAs reported by Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency markets saw a broad rally on Monday, with Bitcoin surging above $27,000, marking its first such rise this month.\n\nThe precise reason for this market movement remained unclear. However, there was a noticeable spike in trading volume during the Asian market's opening hours.\n\nThis surge in volume came following a report by Japan's Nikkei, suggesting that the Japanese government intends to permit startups to offer digital tokens to venture capital funds, in addition to traditional assets like shares and stock options.\n\nConclusion\n\nA number of factors are driving the resurgence of interest in Bitcoin and the potential for another bull run, including institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, growing institutional infrastructure, Bitcoin's scarcity, mainstream acceptance, technological advancements, regulatory clarity, and the expanding DeFi ecosystem. These elements have contributed to a favorable climate for Bitcoin as an investment asset as well as a store of value.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can move dramatically in a short period of time. Before entering the cryptocurrency market, investors should perform extensive research, analyze their risk tolerance, and examine their long-term investing objectives. While these elements enhance Bitcoin's potential for another bull run, it is still vulnerable to market dynamics and investor sentiment."

        "title": "Bitcoin investors are bullish on the US Fed's $100B loss - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve made a significant announcement on Sept. 14, revealing accumulated losses of $100 billion in 2023. What\u2019s more, this situation is expected to worsen for the Fed, according to Reuters. But for risk assets like Bitcoin (BTC), this may actually be a blessing in disguise.\n\nThe Fed in the red\n\nThe primary reason behind this financial setback is that the interest payments on the Fed\u2019s debt have surpassed the earnings generated from its holdings and the services it provides to the financial sector.\n\nAs a result of this development, investors are now scrambling to grasp how this will impact interest rates and the demand for provably scarce assets like BTC.\n\nFed earnings remittances due to the U.S. Treasury, USD (millions). Source: St. Louis Fed\n\nSome analysts are of the opinion that the Fed\u2019s losses, which commenced a year ago, could potentially double by 2024. The central bank categorizes these negative results as \u201cdeferred assets,\u201d arguing that there\u2019s no immediate necessity to cover them.\n\nThe Fed used to generate revenue for U.S. Treasury\n\nHistorically, the Federal Reserve has been a profitable institution. However, the absence of profits does not hinder the central bank\u2019s ability to conduct monetary policy and achieve its objectives.\n\nRelated: How do the Fed\u2019s interest rates impact the crypto market?\n\nThe fact that the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has incurred losses isn\u2019t surprising, especially given the substantial interest rate hikes, which escalated from near-zero in March 2022 to the current level of 5.25%. Even if interest rates remain unchanged, Reuters suggested that the Fed\u2019s losses are likely to persist for some time. This can be attributed to the expansionary measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 when the central bank aggressively acquired bonds to stave off a recession.\n\nEven if interest rates remain unchanged, Reuters suggested that the Fed\u2019s losses are likely to persist for some time. This can be attributed to the expansionary measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 when the central bank aggressively acquired bonds to stave off a recession.\n\nIn essence, the Fed functions like a conventional bank, as it must provide yields to its depositors, which primarily consist of banks, money managers and financial institutions.\n\nAn article in Barron's effectively illustrates the impact of the $100 billion loss, stating,\n\n\u201cThe Fed banks\u2019 losses don\u2019t increase federal budget deficits. But the now-vanished big profits that they used to send the Treasury did help hold down the deficit, which is $1.6 trillion so far this fiscal year..\u201d\n\nU.S. total gross debt and debt ceiling, USD (trillions). Source: BBC\n\nClearly, this situation is unsustainable, particularly considering that the U.S. debt has now reached $33 trillion. While one might point fingers at the Fed for raising interest rates initially, it\u2019s essential to recognize that without such measures, inflation would not have returned to 3.2%, and the cost of living would have continued to exert pressure on the economy.\n\nUltimately, the significant demand for short-term bonds and money market funds is a reflection of the trillions of dollars injected into the economy during the peak of the pandemic. Nevertheless, even if one settles for a fixed 5% yield on a three-month investment, there\u2019s no guarantee that inflation will remain below this threshold for an extended period.\n\nFurthermore, investors are confronted with the risk of dilution each time the U.S. Federal Reserve injects liquidity into the market, whether through the sale of assets from its balance sheet or when the Treasury raises the debt limit.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s improbable that fixed-income returns will outpace inflation for another 12 months because, at some point, the government will exhaust its funds and be compelled to issue additional Treasurys.\n\nReal estate and stocks no longer a reliable store of value\n\nThere remains a significant unanswered question regarding which sector or asset class will reap the most benefits when inflation catches up with short-term Treasury yields. This uncertainty arises as the S&P 500 stands just 7% below its all-time high, while the real estate market exhibits signs of strain due to mortgage rates hitting their highest levels in over two decades.\n\nOn one hand, the S&P 500 index doesn\u2019t appear excessively valued, trading at 20x estimated earnings \u2014 especially when compared with previous peaks that reached 30x multiples or even higher. However, investors are apprehensive that the Fed may find itself compelled to further raise interest rates in order to combat the prevailing inflationary pressures.\n\nAs the cost of capital continues its ascent, corporate earnings will come under pressure, leaving investors with no secure harbor for their cash reserves.\n\nPresently, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may not seem like a viable hedge option, but this perspective could shift as investors realize that the U.S. government\u2019s debt ceiling is essentially boundless. Thus, it might make sense to gradually accumulate these assets regardless of short-term price trends.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "On September 17, 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officially declared Bitcoin a commodity, a distinction that eight years later continues to set it apart from other cryptocurrencies that have yet to earn this status.\n\nWhile regulatory uncertainty still looms over other more centralized, digital assets, the CFTC's classification of Bitcoin as a commodity established a regulatory framework for Bitcoin, one that allows it to be treated like other classical commodities including gold and precious metals.\n\nIn its ruling, the CFTC stated that Section 1a(9) of the CEA defines commodity to include \"all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.\"\n\n\"The definition of a 'commodity' is broad... Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are encompassed in the definition and properly defined as commodities,\" the agency wrote at the time.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler, has been actively scrutinizing various digital assets to determine whether they should be classified as securities, an ongoing evaluation that has created a complex and evolving landscape for altcoins.\n\nIn recent remarks, Chairman Gensler reiterated the SEC's commitment to maintaining a strong regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. He emphasized that the distinction between commodities and securities depends on the specific characteristics of each digital asset.\n\nGensler acknowledged that while Bitcoin, due to its decentralized nature, qualifies as a commodity, other cryptocurrencies exhibit traits that might classify them as securities.\n\nThe determination hinges on factors like the degree of centralization, utility, and the presence of third-party entities. Gensler's remarks underscore the ongoing debate within regulatory circles about how to classify cryptocurrencies effectively.\n\nOf much debate has been the Howey Test, the regulatory standard set in the 1900s that seeks to establish when a certain investment offers the promise of a financial return from the work of others.\n\nCrucially, Bitcoin, with its use of proof-of-work as a consensus mechanism allows anyone in the world who can generate electricity to purchase or create a mining machine, whose calculations can enable that participant to claim the new cryptocurrency that it creates.\n\nThis distinction separates Bitcoin from the ambiguity surrounding other altcoins, and continues to be a major catalyst for Bitcoin's legitimacy and growth in the financial markets at a time when the regulatory status of other cryptocurrencies, at least in the United States, remains mired in uncertainty.\n\nThe 8th anniversary of Bitcoin's classification as a commodity is a reminder of the progress made in this regard, even as other cryptocurrencies await definitive regulatory guidance from the SEC.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin futures open interest jumps by $1B: Manipulation or hedge? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) open interest on derivatives exchanges experienced a sudden surge of $1 billion on Sept. 18, prompting investors to question whether whales were accumulating in anticipation of the unsealing of Binance\u2019s court filings.\n\nHowever, a closer look at derivatives metrics suggests a more nuanced picture, as the funding rate did not exhibit clear signs of excessive buying demand.\n\nThe decision to unseal these documents was granted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which had accused Binance of non-cooperation despite previously agreeing to a consent order related to unregistered securities operations and other allegations.\n\nBTC futures aggregate open interest, USD (green, left). Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe open interest spiked to $12.1 billion, while Bitcoin\u2019s price concurrently increased by 3.4%, reaching its highest point in over two weeks at $27,430.\n\nHowever, investors soon realized that, aside from a comment by the Binance.US auditor regarding the challenges of ensuring full collateralization, there was little concrete information revealed in the unsealed documents.\n\nLater in the day, Federal Judge Zia Faruqui rejected the SEC\u2019s request to inspect Binance.US\u2019 technical infrastructure and share additional information. Nevertheless, the judge stipulated that Binance.US must furnish more details about its custody solution, casting doubt on whether Binance International ultimately controls these assets.\n\nBy the end of Sept. 18, Bitcoin\u2019s open interest had receded to $11.3 billion as its price dropped by 2.4% to $26,770. This decline indicated that the entities behind the open interest surge were no longer inclined to maintain their positions.\n\nThese whales were likely disappointed with the court\u2019s outcomes, or the price action may not have unfolded as expected. In any case, 80% of the open interest increase disappeared in less than 24 hours.\n\nFutures\u2019 buyers and sellers are matched at all times\n\nIt can be assumed that most of the demand for leverage was driven by bullish sentiment, as Bitcoin\u2019s price climbed alongside the increase in open interest and subsequently plummeted as 80% of the contracts were closed. However, attributing cause and effect solely to Binance\u2019s court rulings seems unwarranted for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, no one anticipated that the unsealed documents would favor Binance or its CEO, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, given that it was the SEC that had originally requested their release. Additionally, the Bitcoin futures contract funding rate, which gauges imbalances between long and short positions, remained largely stable throughout this period.\n\nBTC futures average 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinGlass\n\nIf there had indeed been an unforeseen demand surge of $1 billion in open interest, primarily driven by desperate buyers, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the funding rate would have spiked above 0.01%. However, quite the opposite unfolded on Sept. 19, as Bitcoin\u2019s open interest expanded to $11.7 billion, while the funding rate plunged to zero.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s price rallying above $27,200 during this second phase of open interest growth, it becomes increasingly evident that, regardless of the underlying motives, the price pressure tends to be upward. While the exact rationale may remain elusive, certain trading patterns could shed light on this movement.\n\nMarket makers\u2019 hedge could explain OI spike\n\nOne plausible explanation could be the involvement of market makers in executing buy orders on behalf of substantial clients. This would account for the initial enthusiasm in both the spot market and BTC futures, propelling the price higher. After the initial surge, the market maker becomes fully hedged, eliminating the need for further buying and leading to a price correction.\n\nDuring the second phase of the trade, there is no impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price, as the market maker must offload the BTC futures contracts and purchase spot Bitcoin. This results in a reduction in open interest and may disappoint some participants who were anticipating additional buying fervor.\n\nRather than hastily labeling every \u201cBart\u201d formation as manipulation, it is advisable to delve into the operations of arbitrage desks and carefully analyze the BTC futures funding rate before jumping to conclusions. Thus, when there is no excessive demand for leveraged long positions, an increase in open interest does not necessarily signify a buying spree, as was the case on Sept. 18.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Cuba, a country known for its unique blend of rich history, vibrant culture and political isolation, is the focus of Cointelegraph\u2019s latest on-the-ground documentary. The Truth Behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution explores Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) impact in one of the world\u2019s last remaining communist states.\n\nThe documentary provides a firsthand account of how Cubans are using Bitcoin to navigate challenging economic circumstances, attract new businesses and save money in a censorship-heavy environment.\n\nJournalist and Bitcoin enthusiast Joe Hall embarked on the journey to Cuba, determined to witness and capture the \u201cBitcoin revolution\u201d that gained prominence in Alex Gladstein\u2019s book Check Your Financial Privilege. Gladstein explains how Cubans have harnessed Bitcoin\u2019s stateless, low-fee nature to escape financial oppression and secure their savings.\n\nThe documentary explores how Bitcoin has taken root in the Cuban financial landscape, brought to life through interviews and interactions with Cubans, as well as the co-founders of the \u201cCuba Bitcoin\u201d community \u2014 Forte, Catrya and Bitalion (not their real names). Paco de la India, a regular Cointelegraph contributor, traveled with Hall and provides feedback and commentary throughout the documentary.\n\nBitcoin users in Cuba primarily engage in peer-to-peer transactions, buying and selling Bitcoin through Telegram and Signal groups. They run nodes with limited resources and evade online surveillance and access banned internet sites with VPNs.\n\nUnlike many countries, Cuba is devoid of centralized crypto exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance. Plus, Cubans are banned from creating accounts due to the country\u2019s poor diplomatic relations with the United States.\n\nConsequently, the environment for Bitcoin in Cuba is a unique ecosystem that operates almost entirely outside of the reach of the state. Moreover, the resilient Bitcoin community is set against a backdrop of economic hardship. Seventy-two percent of Cubans live below the poverty line, and while the minimum monthly wage is approximately $30, Catrya \u2014 one of the documentary\u2019s main characters \u2014 explains that it is closer to $13.\n\nReporter Joe Hall, Paco de la India and only $200 in Cuban peso bills.\n\nCuba\u2019s economic hardships are exacerbated by hyperinflation, with the Cuban peso losing more than 940% of its value in the last two years. Through testimonials and interviews with Cubans across Havana, it\u2019s clear that Bitcoin has emerged as a lifeline for those looking to protect their savings from currency devaluation.\n\nRelated: Cuba Bitcoin community hosts BTC-only meetup\n\nThe documentary captures the grassroots adoption of Bitcoin in Cuba. It also highlights the efforts of the humble Cuba Bitcoin community, who spend their time educating and propagating the principles of Bitcoin to Cubans in an environment where the consequences of their actions are uncertain.\n\nUltimately, as Bitcoin continues to gain traction in Cuba, it remains to be seen how the government will react to the emergence of a parallel financial system. The Truth Behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution provides a rare glimpse into a nation on the cusp of transformative change. Bitcoin could offer Cubans a glimmer of hope and freedom on an island where such aspirations have been long suppressed.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "title": "Bitcoin bounce due to Mt. Gox delay rumors but still targeting $22,000, says QCP - The Block",
        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -0.62% 's recent price bounce \u2014 up more than 5% over the last week \u2014 is largely due to rumors of a delay for Mt. Gox repayments into 2024, according to trading firm QCP Capital. However, the firm still targets the $22,000 level for bitcoin in October.\n\nThe deadline for creditors of Mt. Gox, which collapsed in 2014, to provide their repayment information passed in April \u2014 opening the window for repayments to be carried out by Oct. 31. However, the deadline for repayments could be subject to change, the Mt. Gox trustee said at the time. Mt. Gox is set to distribute an unknown portion of the 142,000 BTC ($3.9 billion), 143,000 BCH +3.02% ($31.3 million) and 69 billion Japanese yen ($467 million) that it holds.\n\n\"A large reason we're seeing for this bounce are rumors of a Mt. Gox delay to 2024,\" QCP said in its latest market update. \"With the prior expected date just a month away, we believe many went short on this, and an official announcement will surely drive a short squeeze identical to the release of the SEC vs. GBTC judgment last month.\"\n\nHowever, the crypto trading firm expects the bounce to be short-lived, with any spike to fade quickly as global risks weigh on the crypto markets into Q4, in line with its $22,000 target.\n\n\"The current Wave 2 of our C Wave expanded flat has so far bounced which we expected, but we still need to see the crucial Wave 3 that breaks the local lows for our count to be intact,\" QCP said. \"The invalidation point would likely be a break of prior highs above $32,000.\"\n\nGlobal risks weigh on crypto markets\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nComing into another FOMC interest rate decision week, the S&P 500's volatility index (VIX) has marked its longest streak of trading under 19 since 2020, QCP said. This eerily mirrors the 2020 scenario, QCP argues, which culminated in the record volatility spike due to the Covid crash.\n\nWhile the market remains speculative about another potential volatility squeeze, it's unlikely that the upcoming FOMC meeting will be the trigger, with another pause widely anticipated. The FOMC's appetite for further rate hikes this year also seems minimal, according to QCP.\n\nHowever, \"At the same time, we do not see how Powell can assuredly call an end to this hiking cycle, given the surging pump prices and rebounding inflation,\" the crypto trading firm added, expecting higher for longer rates (no cuts) next year.\n\nA potential U.S. government shutdown at the end of September, with funding for the federal government set to run out unless action is taken by Congress, and rising oil prices all fuel the tail risks, QCP said. It claimed that the Fed was unlikely to act on suppressing volatility this time.\n\n\"In such a scenario without Fed easing, equities will likely be down, taking bitcoin down along with it until the Fed acts,\" the firm added."

An Italian Ethereum fan comments on Bitcoin maximalism, Latin Americans observe Europeans\u2019 behavior regarding recycling, and Taiwanese students settle into life around the cryptocurrency.\n\nThis week\u2019s episode of Decentralize also investigates how deep Bitcoin and crypto adoption reaches in Lugano, the distinctly Italian city in the southern section of Switzerland. The city adopted Bitcoin as de facto legal tender one year ago, and there has been noticeable progress since then \u2014 with the Bitcoin \u201cB\u201d logo hard to miss in the town center.\n\nMore than 200 vendors accept Bitcoin in Lugano. Big brands like McDonald\u2019s, Rolex and even Lamborghini will take the cryptocurrency, while some pharmacies, convenience stores and tobacco shops also accept it.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is still not deeply or broadly understood, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done if Lugano is to one day fully embrace it, as Ardoino explained:\n\n\u201dI wish I was able to say that our job is done, but I think we are just at the beginning. The most important part is the education of the merchants.\u201d\n\nThe point-of-sale devices merchants use across Lugano also accept Tether (USDT) and Luga, a token that locals and residents can use.\n\nRelated: Pro-crypto city of Lugano and El Salvador sign economic agreement based on adoption\n\nTo hear a secret from Back concerning MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, learn what Paraguayans made of Switzerland on their first-ever trip to Europe, and discover why the efforts in Lugano could spread to other areas of Europe, plug in and listen in to this week\u2019s episode of Decentralize with Cointelegraph \u2014 available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Cointelegraph\u2019s podcast page and more.\n\nThe episode also serves as a sneak preview of an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary about life in Lugano.

        "content": "Widely followed on-chain analyst Willy Woo says there\u2019s one thing making him worried about the future of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new interview with Peter McCormack at a live What Bitcoin Did discussion, Woo says he\u2019s concerned about the growing \u201cfinancialization\u201d of Bitcoin through the various derivative products being launched that he says have the ability to manipulate price and take liquidity away from BTC.\n\nAccording to Woo, Bitcoin\u2019s Sharpe Ratio metric, which aims to compare the return of an investment with its risk, has slowly declined ever since 2019 when BTC derivatives started popping up.\n\n\u201cBitcoin was killing it. It beat every other asset on the planet. It was like three to four [on the Shape Ratio], that\u2019s very high. Now it\u2019s dropped down to around twoish, something like that\u2026\n\nWhere we are right now is actually converging onto every other macro asset on the planet, similar to equities, similar to gold, bonds, and emerging currencies. It\u2019s like all macro assets trade within a range, and Bitcoin is just into that\u2026\n\nThat happened in 2018-2019. And the question is what happened in 2018-2019? It was the financialization of Bitcoin. We had the perpetual swap, we had calendar futures, paperization of Bitcoin. Say I\u2019m the US government and I\u2019ve got $20 trillion of capital out there \u2013 M2 money supply \u2013 you can make policy, you can print more money, you can incentivize particular markets.\n\nAnd the reality is Bitcoin\u2019s maybe a half a trillion dollar asset. There are 21 million Bitcoins associated with that. If I print $1 trillion, I can sell $42 trillion in Bitcoin. So that\u2019s the issue right now is, we\u2019ve got the paperization of these markets and Bitcoin is traded like any other macro asset on the planet. I think that\u2019s a big worry for me.\n\nWoo says the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) may come with the catch of larger entities being able to influence price.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a spot ETF, okay we can buy up to 21 million \u2013 well actually 1 million because that\u2019s what\u2019s available \u2013 but in the meantime you\u2019ve got these paper markets that have this huge ability to control the market.\u201d\n\nO\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Dominance Back Above 50% as Altcoins Struggle - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin is back in the spotlight. Currently priced at $26,684, the flagship cryptocurrency now accounts for over 50% of the total crypto market, with a market cap of approximately $520 billion. The milestone is particularly significant as it comes at a time when many alternative cryptocurrencies, commonly referred to as altcoins, are experiencing stagnation or decline. Despite regaining dominance, Bitcoin's position is still down 4.5% from its June high and 22.5% from its peak in January 2022.\n\nAltcoins struggle to keep up\n\nAltcoins like Ethereum, BNB and XRP are lagging behind in performance compared to Bitcoin. Ethereum, the closest competitor, is currently priced at $1,632.09, down 0.1% in the past hour and only up 1.1% over the last week. Similar trends are apparent on other altcoins; BNB is up just 2.4% over the week, while XRP has declined by 0.4%.\n\nSome lesser-known coins like Toncoin have shown dramatic price swings, but they occupy a much smaller slice of the market. The underwhelming performance of these alternative cryptocurrencies has contributed to Bitcoin's recent increase in market dominance.\n\nHistorical trends\n\nBitcoin's regained market dominance aligns with historical trends, including its tendency to spike during bear markets. Bitcoin remains the pioneer and the most well-known crypto asset, and its market share has fluctuated over time, especially during periods of altcoin surges.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has often gained ground in bearish climates, serving as a sort of digital \"safe haven\" for investors. Despite the current upward trend, it is crucial to note that Bitcoin's dominance is still far from its peak levels as it is down from both its June high of 52% and the bull market zenith it reached in December 2020 of 73%.\n\nHowever, there might still be room for growth. Analyst Benjamin Cowen tweeted, \"You know what would look better than 50% #BTC dominance? 60% BTC dominance.\""

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUPDATE: Satlantis has announced that the Bitcoin play-to-earn functionality will be removed from its Minecraft server on September 25 following a demand from Minecraft creator Mojang. The feature violates the game's recently updated usage guidelines. Read the full report. The following guide will no longer be accurate as of that date.\n\nORIGINAL STORY: Did you know you can earn Bitcoin by playing Minecraft?\n\nSatlantis, a Minecraft server, lets users earn Bitcoin while they play. Players can enter a virtual mining pool that pays out real satoshis (sats) to players every 10 minutes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA satoshi is the smallest unit of measurement for Bitcoin, with each Bitcoin containing 100 million satoshis. According to Zebedee, which created the tech to power the third-party server, over 1 million satoshis (nearly $300) is given out every week.\n\nHow do you get involved? How does it work? And how much can you really earn? We spent numerous hours in-game to help you get started\u2014both in text and via the video walkthrough below.\n\nHow do you earn Bitcoin in Minecraft?\n\nSatlantis is a Minecraft server that is accessible via Minecraft: Java Edition on computers. The server IP is play.satlantis.net.\n\nAnyone can hop onto Satlantis and play, but to earn Bitcoin, you must get a virtual ASIC miner\u2014the type of miner needed to mine Bitcoin in real life, too\u2014and then fuel it with emeralds. This will increase your hashrate (seen on the right side of the screen), which will then enter you into a raffle every 10 minutes to win a sliver of Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lowest-tier ASIC miner adds 10 to your hashrate, but you can get an ASIC miner that produces up to 45 hashrate for you.\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nTo calculate your chances of winning, divide your hashrate by the global hashrate shown on-screen, and then multiply by 100. During our short time playing, we managed to get a maximum of 30 hashrate with a global hashrate of 52,630. This means that we had a 0.057% chance of winning Bitcoin, every 10 minutes.\n\nYou can also join a clan to combine your hashrate with the other members. This improves your chances at winning more consistently, with the earnings being split between members based on how much they contributed to the group's hashrate.\n\nWhile ASIC miners are the primary way of earning sats in-game, you can also trade your way to some Bitcoin. There is a marketplace available where users will sell items as menial as dirt or as rare as elytras\u2014this is where we got our ASIC miners!\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nDon't get fooled by the marketplace price tags, though! What looks like $2,000 actually means 2,000 sats\u2014which is currently just over $0.50.\n\nHow do I get an ASIC miner in Satlantis?\n\nThere are two ways to get ASIC miners in Satlantis: through the battle pass or the marketplace.\n\nThe battle pass, which you can access by typing \u201c/bp\u201d into the in-game chat, is available on free and paid tiers. In season 3, the current season as of this writing, you have to get to level 51 on the free battle pass before you get an \"Elliptic Key,\" which allows you to get an ASIC miner via an \"Elliptic Crate.\u201d\n\nIf 51 tiers of a free battle pass seems a bit too intense for you, the premium battle pass gives you an Elliptic Key at level 10. A premium battle pass costs $40 via Stripe, or 120,000 satoshis\u2014approximately $33 as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn order to level up the battle pass, you really have to actively work at it\u2014your quests are rarely completed as a byproduct of playing normally. There are fun quests, such as a \"Where's Waldo?\" task where you must find Waldo hidden somewhere in the world. But there are also more grindy quests, like \"Deal 10,000 points of damage to a player.\u201d\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nAfter playing for a while, we decided to cut this corner and buy some ASIC miners directly from the marketplace.\n\nFirst we had to get money onto Satlantis. This is done by typing \u201c/deposit\u201d and sending Bitcoin via the Lightning Network to the address shown on-screen via a QR code. We loaded on $9, which gave us 32,999 SATs, and bought three virtual ASIC s10 miners for 29,000 SATs.\n\nHow do you fuel the ASICs?\n\nIn order for your ASIC miner to produce a hashrate, it must be fueled with an emerald. You do not need to be logged on to produce hashrate or collect rewards, so the game can run in the background while you're doing other stuff on your PC.\n\nThe maximum amount of emeralds you can put in an ASIC miner is 64 per fuel slot. This only increases the amount of time that your ASIC miner will produce hashrate\u2014this was 18 hours, three minutes, and 20 seconds for our s10 miner.\n\nIt's important to note that you do not obtain emeralds the same way you would in vanilla Minecraft. Instead, there are traders in the lobby that will exchange ores and sugar cane for emeralds.\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nWith exchange rates like 32 diamonds for 16 emeralds, you'll be forgiven for thinking that securing stacks of 64 emeralds is unattainable. But you'd be wrong.\n\nBy entering \u201c/mines\u201d in the chat, you'll be teleported to a crazy mine system with an abundance of every ore you'll need. In these mines, I managed to get two stacks of 64 diamonds within 20 minutes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou can take things to the next level by entering the diamond mines. To get there. you must complete an incredibly challenging parkour course. If you want to make things easier for yourself, then purchase an elytra (a set of wings) and fly down\u2014we eventually did this.\n\nOnce down there, you'll find lots of mushrooms (great to make mushroom soup), mobs (aka enemy creatures, to complete quests), and Poseidon's tomb.\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nIn this tomb, there's an incredible amount of ores to mine. It can be slightly overwhelming when you first enter, but it\u2019s not all smooth sailing as you'll have to defend yourself against mobs.\n\nHow much can you earn?\n\nOver four days of sporadically playing on the Satlantis server, we managed to keep our three ASIC s10 miners running for about 41 hours in total.\n\nFor the vast majority of that span, we\u2019d earned zero Bitcoin. We were onto our last hour of fuel with the game running in the background when suddenly we won the raffle.\n\nWe earned 16,034 sats during our time on the server. This is just over $4 as of this writing, meaning we are nearly halfway to earning our initial investment back.\n\nHow do you withdraw Bitcoin from Satlantis?\n\nOnce you're ready to cash out, simply type \u201c/withdraw\u201d followed by the amount you want to withdraw. Next, you'll be asked to enter your Lightning Network address. Once you've done this, you\u2019ll need to wait up to 48 hours for the transaction to process.\n\nThe Satlantis server is an intriguing way for gamers to earn Bitcoin while playing one of the most popular games of all time. It can be difficult to get started, but the guide above should help you get your bearings\u2014and don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions in the server\u2019s Discord or in-game chat, as the community appears to be very supportive of newcomers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to add detail on how clans work in Satlantis."

        "title": "Bitcoin bulls defend BTC, push toward $27,000 ahead of FOMC interest rate decision - FXStreet",
        "content": "Bitcoin price is making steady gains, heading toward the $27,000 level after bearish August.\n\nBTC holders are closely watching the Federal Reserve interest rate decision at the FOMC meeting that concludes on September 20.\n\nBitcoin price could benefit from upside volatility if there is no change in rates, but rate hike could increase selling pressure on BTC.\n\nBitcoin price action of late has fueled optimism among traders as the asset climbs toward $27,000 after a weak performance throughout August and the first two weeks of September. BTC holders are likely watching the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday closely for cues on where the asset\u2019s price is headed next.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision could act as a potential volatility driver for the asset as macroeconomic factors have had an impact on BTC prices throughout 2023.\n\nAlso read: XRP price fights risk of decline, sustains above $0.50 despite NYDFS action\n\nBitcoin price eyes $27,000 ahead of Fed rate decision\n\nBitcoin price is heading into a volatility-filled week with the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. This event is key to BTC as the US Central bank will make a decision on interest rates, a macroeconomic factor that has typically influenced the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nMarket participants do not expect the Fed to pivot from its stance on interest rates. CME\u2019s FedWatch Tool has gathered a 99% probability of no hike and a 1% probability of an increase to 5.5% to 5.75%.\n\nTarget rate probabilities for Fed\u2019s interest rate decision on September 20\n\nNo interest rate hike could result in Bitcoin price recovery gaining strength. An interest rate hike on the other hand could spring a surprise on BTC holders and increase the selling pressure on Bitcoin. Additionally, hawkish rhetoric may increase the odds of a hike later this year and thus lead to a sell-off in crypto assets.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction in the past to interest rate hikes by the US Central bank has been a downside surprise to BTC price as market participants rapidly pull capital out of risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nTraders\u2019 focus will be on the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), a consensus among Fed governors for how the economy will shape up during the current calendar year and the next two years. This forecast is likely to set the tone for the rest of 2023 and help determine the direction in which BTC price is headed for the end of the year.\n\nWhales sit on the sidelines, await FOMC outcome\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker Santiment, as of Tuesday, Bitcoin\u2019s large wallet investors are sitting on the sidelines. The surge in Bitcoin address activity and the short-lived price rally in response to the US CPI report acted as volatility drivers for BTC in September.\n\nThe Whale transaction activity chart shows relatively low movement ahead of the FOMC decision.\n\nWhale transaction count vs BTC price\n\nAs the FOMC approaches, on-chain analysts at Santiment highlight the need of a catalyst to drive BTC price recovery. In the short-term, there has been an increase in profit-taking among cryptocurrencies with large market capitalization.\n\nAmong these assets, BTC has recorded the highest ratio of profit vs. loss since the first week of July. This is typically considered a warning sign of an upcoming decline in BTC. The interest rate decision by the US Federal Reserve could alleviate BTC holders\u2019 concerns,while the absence of an interest rate hike could drive the asset\u2019s price higher and aid recovery."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFollowing weeks of debate about Bitcoin drivechains, a similar project to unlock the network\u2019s programming potential is picking up steam.\n\nOn Monday, Jameson Lopp\u2014co-founder and CTO of mobile self-custody firm Casa\u2014published a blog post about \u201cSpiderchain,\u201d which he called \u201cyet another proposal for building 2-way pegged sidechains.\u201d\n\nA sidechain is a separate blockchain that is tied into the main Bitcoin network in some way. They typically use the same native currency\u2014BTC\u2014and may also leverage Bitcoin\u2019s security guarantees. Sidechains let Bitcoiners access more features with their BTC that the main network can\u2019t always provide, such as scalability, programmability, and privacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA prevailing difficulty with sidechains, however, is building a \u201c2-way peg\u201d allowing BTC to be safely transferred to the sidechain and back without requiring a centralized middleman.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Spiderchain, developed by Botanix Labs, comes into play.\n\n\u201cThe Spiderchain works as a Proof of Stake Layer 2 on Bitcoin,\u201d Willem Schro\u00e9, founder of Botanix Labs, told Decrypt. \u201cYou stake Bitcoin on Bitcoin in decentralized multisigs.\u201d\n\n\n\nEntities that manage decentralized multisigs are called \u201corchestrators,\u201d who run both a Bitcoin node and a Spiderchain node. With every request to move BTC to the Spiderchain, a new multisig is created that\u2019s controlled by a random subset of 100 participants within the staker set.\n\nIn many ways, the Spiderchain operates much like Ethereum: it is Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible, has 12-second block times, and uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism to secure the network, whereby orchestrator nodes must stake BTC to participate.\n\nIts EVM is also \u201cfully equivalent,\u201d meaning existing Ethereum dapps can be easily transferred over to the network by developers. But unlike Ethereum, Schro\u00e9 said that a malicious majority of orchestrators still cannot conspire to steal users\u2019 BTC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe design is possible on the current Bitcoin core, so no soft fork or upgrade is needed,\u201d noted Schro\u00e9. This sets Spiderchain apart from Paul Sztorc\u2019s drivechain proposal, which requires changing the Bitcoin code that users and miners are currently running.\n\n\n\nDrivechain was introduced as BIP 300 and BIP 301 back in 2015, and is still yet to be widely embraced for implementation by Bitcoiners.\n\nDrivechains effectively put control of pegged BTC into the hands of Bitcoin miners, but allow for any number of sidechains with any number of properties to be created. It also directly inherits Bitcoin\u2019s security through merge mining, which piggybacks on the main network\u2019s immense proof of work security.\n\nWhen asked about Spiderchains, Sztorc said they seem \u201cvery complex\u201d compared to his proposal.\n\n\u201cI also think that the whole \"needs a change to Bitcoin\" is pure superstition, unfortunately,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople think it means 'the network' must upgrade, but really it is like asking users to install an app on their phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Lopp\u2019s Monday blog post, the CTO cited the nearly decade-old Rootstock proposal, and pointed out some technical vulnerabilities with Spiderchain. Among them is the risk that its BTC peg is \u201cbroken\u201d if the main Bitcoin blockchain experiences a reorg of longer than five blocks, due to the system by which Spiderchain orchestrators are determined.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would be unlikely to be catastrophic due to how the funds are dispersed across many multi-sig wallets,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nSchro\u00e9 also admitted that in the network\u2019s early stages, Spiderchain will be centralized until more users can come in to stake their BTC. \u201cWe need to start off centralized in the sense that initially we will have to make the staking permissioned,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter a 48-hour coding sprint, a Friend.tech look-alike dubbed Alpha launched on top of Bitcoin this weekend, bringing a social token experience to users of the venerated blockchain.\n\nLike Friend.tech\u2014which is built on Ethereum scaling network Base and saw a flurry of activity last month (and a recent revival)\u2014Alpha is a decentralized social network protocol that lets users tokenize and monetize their online presence and content via tokens.\n\nIn other words, people can buy tokens tied to individual creators that rise or fall in price, and can be used to gate access to exclusive content. It\u2019s another incarnation of the \u201csocial token\u201d concept, and social finance projects like these are often billed as being a way to bring new users into the crypto space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter the recent Friend.tech surge, pseudonymous Alpha founder Punk3700 described his Bitcoin-based platform to Decrypt as \u201cthe next big leap in the world of social finance.\u201d Despite building it in a weekend, he said the project \u201caims to bring a luxurious and exclusive experience to social interactions.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, new users are joining the network every few minutes, many of which amass tens or even hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers.\n\nPunk3700 is also one of the core members behind New Bitcoin City, an ecosystem that is dabbling in art, on-chain gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and AI as a way to \u201cexplore Bitcoin beyond just a currency.\u201d\n\nAlpha is the collective's latest development\u2014but its unique tech stack isn\u2019t entirely focused on Bitcoin. According to its founder, Alpha \u201cruns a rollup that rolls up to another rollup that rolls up to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWhat does that even mean? In short, it\u2019s a way of using multiple blockchain networks to create an experience that can be responsive and scalable. In this case, the project leverages a hybrid blockchain architecture with several components: Bitcoin, Ethereum scaling network Polygon, and the project\u2019s own Bitcoin scaling network called Trustless Computer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to New Bitcoin City\u2019s website, a Trustless Computer is a low-cost and speedy layer-2 blockchain built on top of Bitcoin that can support things like a decentralized exchange (DEX), tokenized communities called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and NFT marketplaces.\n\nIt is a no-code tool that allows for developers to choose whether they want to implement Optimistic rollups or zero-knowledge rollups (zkRollups) to facilitate apps built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nAlpha\u2019s hybrid design uses Optimistic rollups as a scaling solution by moving computation and data storage off-chain from Bitcoin. It currently taps into Polygon, the Ethereum scaling network, using it for data storage\u2014although Punk3700 says data availability can eventually live 100% on Bitcoin \u201cif need be.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the differences Alpha has with Friend.tech. Built on Base, Friend.tech leverages rollups directly on Ethereum, inheriting the network\u2019s security. Alpha has to look elsewhere for solutions.\n\n\u201cRollups on Bitcoin right now aren't true rollups because Bitcoin can't verify proofs,\u201d explained Bob Bodily, CEO of Bioniq, an Ordinals marketplace that runs on a Bitcoin sidechain. Lack of verification on Bitcoin\u2019s part means a certain degree of centralization will exist.\n\nThat said, he told Decrypt that \u201cpeople don\u2019t usually wait around for full decentralization,\u201d pointing to the billions locked in layer-2 networks on Ethereum. \u201cPeople are keen to experiment with new tech.\u201d\n\nEven so, Bodily isn\u2019t sold on the answers Alpha\u2019s team provided in response to some of the concerns expressed over the project. He said he still doesn't know who owns the smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) rollups, whether they\u2019re upgradeable or immutable, and more.\n\nTokenomics also raise some enormous red flags, which the team has yet to address. According to the Trustless Computer website, the token supply is approximately $100 million TC, with 99.8% of it sitting in one address.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI've been digging in the explorer, but it's very hard to figure it all out,\u201d Bodily said.\n\nEven amid such concerns, Alpha\u2019s launch has sent a ripple of excitement throughout the Bitcoin space, much as the NFT-like Ordinals protocol and its BRC-20 token standard did earlier this year.\n\nJake Gallen, strategy lead at Emblem Vault, has been at the forefront of the launch. Emblem Vault is a tool that lets users store tokens across blockchains without need for a bridge. \u201cThere is a more authentic feel to it,\u201d Gallen told Decrypt, citing a friendlier user experience, along with the fact that \u201cthere is no point in airdrop farming.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you're building a brand, the goal is to distribute awareness across platforms,\" he concluded. \u201cJust as most people have multiple social media accounts across multiple apps, crypto users will use SocialFi on whichever blockchain they prefer.\u201d"

This man has just 2 guesses to recover $240 million in Bitcoin\n\nOver the years, Koch forgot about the investment and went on with his life.\n\nBehind the scenes, the value of Bitcoin was surging.\n\nBy the time he remembered his $22 investment, four years had passed.\n\nWhen he logged back in to check it out, the 29-year-old\u2019s crypto wallet held a fortune.\n\nKristoffer Koch\n\nIn his crypto wallet, Koch now had a life-changing USD $850,000.\n\n\u201cNot in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that they would have soared like this,\u201d he told local media in Norway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre, these psychological reflexes that make us attach a value to something that doesn\u2019t have any in itself.\u201d\n\nAfter discovering his not-so-mini fortune, Koch used about a fifth of it to pay taxes and buy a flat in Oslo.\n\nThe rest of it, he sensibly left where it was and is now worth even more.\n\nWhile it sounds like a dream, it almost turned into a nightmare for the Norwegian when he couldn\u2019t remember his password to the encrypted wallet.\n\nLuckily after a few failed attempts, he finally got it.\n\nBut not everyone has enjoyed the same luck.\n\nStefan Thomas has found himself in a similar predicament.\n\nThomas has an incredible $240 million in Bitcoins locked away in his crypto wallet, but unlike Koch, he\u2019s had no luck remembering his password.\n\njustmoon / X\n\nThe German-born programmer stored his Bitcoin on a hard drive that gave him 10 guesses to figure out the password before it encrypted itself and locked him out forever.\n\nTo this day, he has just two guesses left to figure out his decade-old password before losing his fortune."

Clever bit of tech helps you find your lost car in a parking lot\n\nThe German-born programmer living in San Francisco was left with just two guesses to figure out the decade-old password keeping his Bitcoin fortune safe.\n\nThis story starts back in 2011 when Thomas uploaded a video to YouTube titled \u201cWhat is Bitcoin?

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were trading higher on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting outcome, where the US central bank is expected to maintain the status quo. The market dominance of Bitcoin in the crypto market has increased to about 50 per cent, which is the highest in the last 26 months.\n\n\n\nBitcoin posted mild gains as the largest crypto token rose about a per cent, nearing $27,000-levels after briefly touching it. Its largest peer, Ethereum, also inched up marginally, to firm its position above $1,600-mark. Price action in the altcoins remained on the positive side in the early hours.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market has traded sideways with an upward bias in the last 24 hours. It has been another positive day for Bitcoin as it touched $27,400 before pulling back slightly, In fact, the last 8 days have been pretty positive for the crypto market with Bitcoin rebounding about 10 per cent from its recent lows, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"Other cryptos worth highlighting are Solana and Chainlink as they have been showing significant momentum ever since the market started to recover. With giants like financial service provider SWIFT using Chainlink\u2019s infrastructure, we can see a significant upside if this momentum continues,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Tuesday. Toncoin surged about 5 per cent, while Solana gained about 4 per cent. Litecoin rose over 3 per cent, whereas XRP and Cardano were up 2 per cent each. Among the losers, BNB declined about a per cent, while Polkadot and Shiba Inu also retreated.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading slightly higher, rising to $1.07 trillion-mark, as it rose about a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 63 per cent to $30.13 billion.\n\n\n\nImage: Crypto-chart-price\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nChainlink(LINK) serves as a blockchain abstraction layer, facilitating seamless connectivity for smart contracts across various platforms. By employing a decentralized oracle network, Chainlink ensures secure interactions between blockchains and external data feeds, events, and payment systems.\n\n\n\nImage: Chart-LINK\n\n\n\nIn the daily time-frame, the LINK/USDT trend has come out of its consolidation phase. The chart has broken out of the descending trendline with a good buildup of volume and we could expect an upward trajectory in the trend during the coming weeks. The next resistance is expected at 7.33 USDT and a strong support is expected at 5.01 USDT.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "In this week\u2019s edition of the top performing ETFs, both bitcoin and uranium ETFs led based on one-week returns. Other metals-focused ETFs like those focused on silver also did well, with a single decarbonization-focused strategy also making an appearance. Both metals and bitcoin strategies play in different overall spaces and trends, but could both owe their returns to defensively-minded investors.\n\nUranium ETFs took four of the 12 total places in the top ranks, but two of those were the top two. The Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) and the Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ) returned 9.5% and 9.4%, respectively. The duo saw the VanEck Uranium+Nuclear Energy ETF (NLR) and the Global X Uranium ETF (URA) join them in the top rankings. URNM has returned a staggering 41.1% year to date and 44.5% over three years, charging 83 basis points.\n\nUnderstanding Uranium ETFs\n\nThe strategies may be benefiting from global uranium demand growing as nations turn their energy systems toward renewable, nuclear power. Nuclear power may also be seeing increased interest, with winter on the horizon for the northern hemisphere. Silver ETFs also performed well for the week, taking two of the top 12 positions.\n\nBitcoin strategies also did well over the last week per Logicly data. Three of the top 12 ETFs focus on bitcoin, including the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF), and the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS). Bitcoin has seen some slight progress on the path toward a possible spot product given recent court decisions, though returns may also owe to cryptocurrency being seen as a diversification play.\n\nFinally, the Subversive Decarbonziation ETF (DKRB) deserves a mention. The fund finished fourth for the week, returning 7.5% in that time. Having just launched in December, it actively invests in firms focused on decarbonization efforts for a 75 basis point fee. Overall, commodities strategies, whether in metal or crypto, led the way for the week.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_536801\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"648\"] Uranium ETFs as well as bitcoin and silver funds led over the last week per Logicly.[/caption]\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Gold/Silver/Critical Materials Channel .\n\nVisualizations and data provided by LOGICLY, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of VettaFi.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? BTC Climbs Above $27,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price is sustaining its bullish momentum from the previous day. Today, it surpassed the $27,000 threshold, a level not seen since August 31. Notably, BTC recorded its first green weekly closing candle in five weeks yesterday. As of press time, the Bitcoin price has reached an intra-day high of $27,267.\n\nWhy Is Bitcoin Price Up Today?\n\nOne major indicator that has captured analysts\u2019 attention is the rapid increase in Open Interest. DaanCrypto, a noted figure in the crypto space, commented on the Open Interest of Bitcoin: \u201cBitcoin Open Interest has been ramping up like crazy these past few hours. Up +$850M in hours.\u201d According to him, this can be an issue if spot bid disappears which could cause for a full retrace similar to before.\n\n\u201cThis would then be due to underwater positions that entered near the top. If spot bid remains then these positions are obviously fine. Open Interest is now back to post Grayscale pump levels,\u201d Daan stated, further noting the resilience in the spot premium at the moment, \u201cLongs are comfy as long as spot bid is present.\u201d\n\nMaartuun, the community manager at CryptoQuant Netherlands, also highlights the rapid surge in Open Interest: \u201cFasten your seat belts. The Open Interest goes bonkers on this break-out attempt. It has increased by $600 million (7%).\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Coinglass data reveals that as of press time, short liquidations for BTC remain modest, with just about $20 million in shorts being liquidated. At press time, OI skyrocketed further, up almost $1 billion (from $11.04 to $12.03 billion).\n\nRenowned analyst @52kskew emphasized the trading behavior on Binance: \u201cMajority chasing shorts aggressively from what I can see so far. Binance Open Interest: Binance perp OI starting to moon again with minimal price difference ~ big move brewing. OI up and insignificant change in perp delta (positions opening into price). Takers still aggressively selling into price, bulls want to see constant limit chasing on the bid here. $26.7K pivotal price for direction.\u201d\n\nAli Martinez, another analyst, pointed towards Bitcoin\u2019s 3-day chart and noted a buy signal by the TD Sequential yesterday. \u201cA boost in $BTC buying pressure might drive prices to the channel\u2019s mid or upper boundary \u2013 targeting $28,000 or $31,000. Still, watch the TD Risk Line at $24,500. It\u2019s the key invalidation point.\u201d\n\nFrom macro perspective, renowned analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) indicated a correlation between USD liquidity and Bitcoin price movements: \u201cIf you can track/forecast USD liquidity, you\u2019ll have a solid idea of where price is headed.\u201d He went on to highlight a divergence between the rise in USD liquidity and the previous stagnation of BTC, emphasizing the recent shift which might be driven by returning liquidity.\n\nMonthly Close Will Be Crucial\n\nAs NewsBTC reported, September is historically one of the worst months of the year for the Bitcoin price. However, this year could be different if BTC continues its trend of the last few days.\n\nRekt Capital highlighted the potential significance of the upcoming monthly candle close for Bitcoin in a recent tweet, stating: \u201cThe upcoming Monthly Candle Close will be pivotal.\u201d According to the analyst, Bitcoin often produces long upward wicks when it transforms old Monthly supports into new resistances.\n\nIn simple terms, an upward wick on a candlestick chart indicates price levels where Bitcoin traded during a period but didn\u2019t close. A long wick suggests a strong rejection from those higher price levels. This could mean that while buyers tried to push the price up during the month, by the close, sellers had brought it back down, leaving a long \u2018wick\u2019 on the candlestick.\n\nRekt Capital suggests that these wicks can extend up to +8% beyond the candle body. The analyst notes that if the monthly candle close produces an upside wick of +7% beyond the ~$27,100 level, it could mean the price might go beyond the weekly lower high.\n\nThis could be a positive sign if the monthly close remains above $27,100, indicating it as a support level. However, if the price closes the month below $27,100 after reaching higher levels, it may confirm $27,100 as a new resistance, hinting that the recent price movement might be just a temporary upward rally.\n\nAt press time, BTC stood at $27,241.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Bank Review 2024 | Is It a Scam or Is It Legit? - Bankless Times",
        "content": "What is Bitcoin Bank? Bitcoin Bank Review\n\nBitcoin Bank is one of the numerous cryptocurrency robots that operate in the cryptocurrency industry to assist those who want to invest in Bitcoin. The auto trading platform claims to use trading bots powered by AI technology to make trades with the funds you deposit into your account. This technology reportedly scans crypto exchanges and monitors market trends to find investment opportunities.\n\nThe aim of cryptocurrency trading apps such as Bitcoin Bank is to buy Bitcoin at a low price and sell it for a profit later.\n\nHowever, as the cryptocurrency market is still very volatile, Bitcoin Bank encourages you to try auto trading in a bid to open a whole new avenue of investment opportunities.\n\nThe concept behind the platform is relatively simple. On the surface, you do not need any prior knowledge of Bitcoin to start investing your money in the market. However, while the company infers that a Bitcoin investment can be life-changing, the truth is far more complicated \u2014 particularly when auto trading is concerned. For starters, this type of trading is very high-risk, especially when you cannot verify the reputability of Bitcoin Bank\u2019s partnered brokers.\n\nBitcoin Bank Overview\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Robot Type: Auto Trading Robot \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\ude80 Claimed Win Rate: 88% \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Free \u231b Withdrawal Timeframe: 24 Hours \ud83d\udcb1 Supported Cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, XRP \ud83d\udcb2 Supported Fiats: USD, EUR, GBP \ud83d\udcca Leverage: 1000:1 \ud83d\udcf1 Native Mobile App: No \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Free Demo Account: Yes \ud83c\udfa7 Customer Support: Email, Live chat \u2705 Verification required: KYC \ud83d\udd01 Automated Trading: Yes \ud83d\udcc8 CFD Available Yes\n\nPros and Cons of Using Bitcoin Bank\n\nPros Low deposit of $250\n\nDemo account and video tutorials available\n\nNo service charges\n\nAvailable in countries that allow Bitcoin trading\n\n24/7 customer support Cons Withdrawing funds is difficult\n\nAuto trading bots are very risky\n\nSome testimonials and reviews are fake\n\nWho is Behind Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThe Bitcoin Bank team allegedly consists of professional traders and experienced software developers. We couldn't find the specific names of the owners, however.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Bank\n\nBitcoin Bank is user-friendly and designed to be used by both new entrants and experienced traders in the crypto market. Take a look below at our brief overview of how to start. Remember, the bot is connected to regulated brokers, so ensure you choose the broker best-suited to your needs before starting.\n\nRegister for a trading account Deposit funds with your broker Customize your parameters and start to trade\n\nBitcoin Bank Markets, Assets, and Options\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies and products can you trade using Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThis trading robot is specifically tailored for digital assets, meaning you can\u2019t use it for assets like forex, stocks, commodities, etc. Therefore, if you want to diversify your portfolio with assets from different markets, consider other bots. For traders and investors in the crypto market, Bitcoin Bank offers trading options for some of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the crypto market. These include:\n\nWhat leverage trading options are there with Bitcoin Bank?\n\nDuring our research for this review, we could not find any conclusive information on the leverage trading options on the Bitcoin Bank platform. However, if the service is like other auto traders, you should expect potential leverages of 1000:1. While this may seem like an enticing proposition, most regulated brokers would never offer such massive leverage options. Trading with high leverage carries high risk, as it will increase your losses, as well as your profits.\n\nIf you want to know more about leveraged trading, take a look at our comprehensive guides:\n\nWhat are the spreads on Bitcoin Bank?\n\nDue to the volatility of the Bitcoin market, you can expect the buying and selling price of cryptocurrency to fluctuate every day. That being said, different brokers will offer you different spreads, all of which will have varying pip values.\n\nFees, Limits, and Payment Options on Bitcoin Bank\n\nHow Much Does Bitcoin Bank Cost?\n\nBesides offering free trade automation services, Bitcoin Bank has deposit bonuses you can enjoy from time to time. Signing up for an account is also free, and there are no subscription charges. You should test it out via its demo account to ensure it aligns with your trading or investment requirements.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription cost: Zero\n\nWhat are the payment methods accepted by Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThere are several alternative payment methods for trading on this platform. These include:\n\nPayPal\n\nMastercard\n\nVisa\n\nAnd more\n\nDoes Bitcoin Bank also charge fees and commissions?\n\nAs we have stated in this Bitcoin Bank review, it does not charge any registration fees when you become a user. Also, you will not face any service charges when you place your initial deposit into your account. However, you can expect the platform to take a small commission of your profits - if you are lucky enough to make any.\n\nBitcoin Bank trade sizes and limits\n\nLike many other auto crypto traders, Bitcoin Bank has set a minimum deposit limit of $250 to purchase cryptocurrency. Interestingly, the platform offers zero information on the maximum trading limit. As such, you can assume that you can invest as much as you like. However, as we have said in this Bitcoin Bank review, auto trading is an unreliable way to invest in Bitcoin and comes with plenty of risks. Therefore, if you are thinking of using an auto trader, we strongly advise keeping to the minimum deposit limit.\n\nBitcoin Bank Platform\n\nHow does Bitcoin Bank work?\n\nThis is an auto trading system that reportedly utilizes AI technology to invest user funds into the Bitcoin market in the hopes of generating returns.\n\nBitcoin Bank claims to use AI bots to find cheap Bitcoin. Then the platform will prompt you to invest in those coins, or if you have selected the auto trade setting, it will purchase the coins for you. Bitcoin Bank will then hold these investments and prompt you when to sell. Sounds easy, right? Well, it also sounds too good to be true. Auto trading is undeniably risky and often ineffective, which means you are likely to lose your money rather than earn a profit.\n\nOn the Bitcoin Bank website, they suggest that your auto trading investments can have numerous benefits on your life, but we could not find many trustworthy testimonials or reviews that supported these claims. While the bots could scour the crypto market much faster than human crypto traders, we would not wholly trust them to help you earn a profit. There is a good chance you will not see a return on your investment given the nature of auto trading.\n\nWhat devices can I use Bitcoin Bank on?\n\nYou can use this platform on any device with a browser that can connect to the internet. This includes:\n\nSmartphones\n\nTablets\n\nDesktops\n\nLaptops\n\nCan I Use Bitcoin Bank in My Country?\n\nCountry Is Bitcoin Bank available? United Kingdom No Canada No Australia Yes USA No South Africa Yes New Zealand Yes Philippines Yes United Arab Emirates Yes Singapore Yes France Yes Spain Yes Italy Yes Germany Yes Nigeria Yes Mexico Yes\n\nWhich exchanges and brokers does Bitcoin Bank partner with?\n\nUnfortunately, we found it difficult to find any concrete information regarding the brokers and exchanges partnered with Bitcoin Bank. That being said, you should remember that high leverage rates are a strong indicator that brokers are probably unregulated and, therefore, less likely to help you earn a profit.\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank available in my language?\n\nBitcoin Bank is available in numerous languages. Unfortunately, the language will be automatically assigned to you based on your geographical location. You can expect to view Bitcoin Bank in:\n\nEnglish\n\nGerman\n\nSpanish\n\nItalian\n\nand more\n\nHow easy is it to use Bitcoin Bank?\n\nRegarding the app itself, Bitcoin Bank is straightforward to navigate. The user interface is relatively minimal and sleek. Account registration is speedy, but that is probably because the company wants you to deposit your funds and get trading. If you are confused by the Bitcoin Bank platform, you can use a demo account to practice making trades without spending any real money.\n\nHow much profit can you make using Bitcoin Bank?\n\nThe amount of profit you could make depends on factors such as how much you trade with and the conditions in the market. Profits aren't guaranteed, however, and you could easily lose your capital.\n\nBitcoin Bank Key Features\n\nBitcoin Bank offers numerous features on the platform to stand out to new users. These include:\n\nCustomer Support\n\nIn preparation for this review, we found that the customer support side of Bitcoin Bank is very attentive. When you create your account, you\u2019ll be contacted by a representative immediately to finalize your registration. If you miss their call, you can expect them to try your number repeatedly until you complete the sign-up process. You can also contact Bitcoin Bank by e-mail or live chat.\n\nLow Deposit\n\nOne of the most advertised Bitcoin Bank features is their low minimum deposit of $250. This makes the bot accessible to a wide range of potential investors.\n\nDemo Account\n\nAs we have already stated, Bitcoin Bank allows you to try out a demo version of the app, which has all the features of the live trading crypto experience, but you do not use your funds, eliminating any risk.\n\nBitcoin Bank Security and Regulation\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank legit?\n\nWe found plenty of Bitcoin Bank review sites online during our research, though many of them were obvious fabrications designed to direct traffic towards the site. Also, the high-leverage options make you wonder how many Bitcoin Bank partnered brokers are regulated. In our experience, regulated brokers and exchanges do not offer astronomical leverage options.\n\nThere have also been some reports that Bitcoin Bank makes it very difficult to withdraw your funds. Details can be found here.\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank safe?\n\nBitcoin Bank is technically safe in regards to your personal information being protected by SSL encryption. However, due to the issues surrounding the problematic withdrawal process and the large amount of risk involved with leveraged trades, we cannot guarantee safety.\n\nAre my money and I protected?\n\nOverall, Bitcoin Bank is highly encrypted and aims to ensure your email and data are protected from hackers\u2019 access.\n\nIs Bitcoin Bank regulated?\n\nThis is difficult to say. We found little information regarding regulated exchanges and brokers on the Bitcoin Bank website. However, as we have stated, we recommend that you avoid any broker that offers obscenely high leverage on your deposit, as they will most likely be unregulated. The best crypto trader regulators are the CySec, FCA, ASIC, and FSB - look for any of these authorities before conducting business with any platform.\n\nDo I have to verify my account with Bitcoin Bank?\n\nYes, when you create your account, you\u2019ll need to provide documents and verify your identity and address. Then you can use your Bitcoin Bank login.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Bank Work? Trading Strategies and Algorithms\n\nBitcoin Bank is AI-powered, using trading signals and algorithms to monitor the cryptocurrency market and trade on your behalf based on potentially profitable market trends it identifies. The robot is designed for high-speed performance. Bitcoin Bank has a claimed win rate of 88% and like any trading product doesn't guarantee successful trades. It does, however, improve trading efficiency through the following strategies and tools.\n\nAutomated Trading Tools\n\nArbitrage Trading\n\nReactive News Trading\n\nPrice Trend Analysis\n\nExtra Information About Bitcoin Bank\n\nEducational Resources\n\nTraders and crypto investors can learn more about cryptocurrency trading from website blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels. All these resources are free, but you can pay for financial advisors\u2019 services should you require extra guidance.\n\nBitcoin Bank comes with plenty of charts and metrics to show you the Bitcoin market projections. You can also set parameters to customize your trading experience.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nBitcoin Bank Customer Support Details Bitcoin Bank support email Not available Bitcoin Bank support contact number Not available Bitcoin Bank live chat option Yes Bitcoin Bank other support options Online Form\n\nDemo Account\n\nBitcoin Bank has a demo account to try out the platform and gauge your skill level before venturing into the live market using real money. The demo account is risk-free, but you must make a minimum deposit of $250 to use it. This is a good way to get started, especially if you are entering the crypto space with zero experience.\n\nHow to get started with Bitcoin Bank? 3 simple steps\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find instructions to help you get started with Bitcoin Bank:\n\nRegistration Registration is a relatively quick and painless process. Simply input your details, and you\u2019ll be contacted by a representative who will see you through the verification procedure. Make a Deposit Once you have created your Bitcoin Bank account, you need to pay a deposit of $250 to trade Bitcoin. You can deposit more funds if you prefer, though we strongly recommend that you stick to the minimum. Begin to Live Trade If you\u2019ve completed the above steps, you are ready to start trading crypto on Bitcoin Bank. Remember to set parameters such as stop losses, and you can always try things out in the demo version first.\n\nHow to Delete Your Bitcoin Bank Account?\n\nTo delete your account, go to Bitcoin Bank's menu at the top corner of the page and access the settings command to initiate the process. Alternatively, you can delete your Bitcoin Bank account by deleting your account with the broker, thus losing your data with that broker as well. You can contact Bitcoin Bank's customer care for guidance.\n\nHow to Withdraw Money From Bitcoin Bank?\n\nBitcoin Bank does not have a cryptocurrency wallet for storing your assets and earnings. The brokers it is connected with do the storing, meaning that your funds can only be accessed through the brokers. Below is the procedure for withdrawing your money from a partnered broker.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Bank\u2019s connected broker\u2019s platform and sign into your trading/investment account Go to your wallet, where you should click withdraw to start the withdrawal process Enter your preferred payment method, such as PayPal or bank transfer Enter an amount to withdraw Click continue to initiate the withdrawal process, which should take up to 24 hours to complete\n\nRemember, most cryptocurrency brokers do not process payouts in crypto assets, and that is why Bitcoin Bank supports various fiat currencies to streamline the withdrawal process. Therefore, choose your preferred fiat currency to successfully withdraw your funds.\n\nBitcoin Bank Celebrity/Company Endorsements\n\nYou may have come across online reviews claiming that top celebrities or companies endorse Bitcoin Bank. We did our research to verify these claims, and below are our opinions based on our findings.\n\nIs Elon Musk Related to Bitcoin Bank?\n\nNo. Elon Musk is a Bitcoin investor and the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.

        "title": "Bitcoin halving countdown is on \u2013 will crypto prices rise? - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "Bitcoin halving countdown is on \u2013 will crypto prices rise?\n\nNew Bitcoin \u2018halving countdown clocks\u2019 are popping up everywhere online again as the crypto community looks ahead to the next halving event, which is most likely, say experts, going to happen between April and May 2024.\n\nBitcoin halving is a programmed event that occurs approximately every four years, reducing the rewards miners receive for validating transactions by half.\n\nThe halving happens every 210,000 blocks. The 2024 halving will happen on block 840,000.\n\nI believe that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price will experience a significant surge in the run-up to this next halving event. Here\u2019s why.\n\nFirst, with each halving, the rate at which new Bitcoins are created decreases. This supply reduction is akin to a rare and predictable event in the world of traditional assets.\n\nBasic economic principles suggest that when supply diminishes and demand remains strong, prices tend to rise. As we draw nearer to the 2024 halving, investors can anticipate this supply reduction, driving up demand for Bitcoin.\n\nSecond, when we examine the history of Bitcoin halvings, a clear pattern emerges. Both the 2012 and 2016 halvings were followed by significant price rallies.\n\nThis historical precedent has established a strong expectation within the crypto community that the 2024 halving will produce similar results. The anticipation of a price surge often leads to increased buying activity in the lead-up to the event, which, again, would likely contribute to a substantial price increase.\n\nThird, the cryptocurrency market has come a long way since its early days. It has matured and gained greater acceptance among institutional investors and the general public.\n\nLarge financial institutions, including hedge funds and asset management companies, have begun to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin. This growing institutional interest lends greater credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class and suggests that more capital will flow into the market as the 2024 halving approaches.\n\nFourth, Bitcoin\u2019s digital scarcity, with a maximum supply capped at 21 million coins, makes it an attractive asset to hedge against inflation.\n\nAs major economies continue to grapple with economic uncertainty and rising inflation rates, investors are increasingly seeking alternative assets like Bitcoin to preserve their wealth. This influx of capital into Bitcoin as a hedge would drive up its price in the months leading up to the halving.\n\nThousands of Bitcoiners held parties in cities across the world to celebrate the 2016 halving, and I imagine there will be more at next year\u2019s event.\n\nMany more savvy investors will likely be quietly celebrating already in anticipation of a possible price surge in the run-up."

        "title": "Rising From Ashes: Berlin Bitcoin Veteran Bitwala Makes Surprise Comeback - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitwala, after having undergone a rebranding and reevaluation of its strategies after last year\u2019s bankruptcy, is now making a surprise return to the cryptocurrency scene.\n\nThe Bitwala app is currently available in 29 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), offering users access to Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014the industry\u2019s two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which can be exchanged for the Euro and can also be sent using SEPA (Single Euro Payment Area) transfers.\n\nHowever, notably absent from the list of supported countries is Germany, the company\u2019s home country where it initially gained traction. While the app is accessible to more than 150,000 previous Nuri banking customers who still have the mobile app installed, as well as new customers, German users face a slightly longer waiting period due to specific procedures related to on- and off-ramp services.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA compliant solution tailored for Germany, according to Bitwala, is currently in the works and is anticipated to be available in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n\u201cThere are still some legal things because Bafin [German\u2019s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority] has always had their special no recipe for success, but we expect to go live in Germany before the end of the year,\u201d Bitwala CEO Dennis Daiber told Decrypt. \u201cIt took us a little longer than anticipated to get everything set up because as we are operating from Germany, there was a lot of a little bit of trickery here and there in the legal setup. So Europe is going live today and then Germany before the end of the year.\u201d\n\nIt's official: Bitwala 2.0 is back, baby! \ud83c\udf89\n\nDownload our new app now: https://t.co/tkxM26xkHr Seamlessly manage your digital assets, make transactions with ease, and explore the world of cryptocurrencies effortlessly.https://t.co/KdlDrYLTNo pic.twitter.com/FIWLSBnOx4 \u2014 Bitwala (@Bitwala) September 18, 2023\n\nBitwala\u2019s one unique feature is the use of self-custodial wallets, ensuring that users have full control over their digital assets, as opposed to relying on a crypto exchange.\n\nIntegration of the Lightning Network, the speedy payment and invoicing service running on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, is also on the agenda, as well as the launch of a crypto-backed Visa debit card, which will allow users to withdraw funds from ATMs or make purchases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSince the start of this year, our core team has eradicated all banking and lending code from the Nuri Mobile Apps,\u201d said Daiber. \u201cWe have rebranded and are now offering Bitwala in the spirit of Berlin Room 77, the place where everything started for us: Freedom of Transaction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Daiber, the relaunched Bitwala app also continues the startup\u2019s original technical approach: \u201cno-hack, no-vulnerability self-custody.\u201d\n\nBitwala 2.0\n\nThe reemergence of Bitwala marks a return to its roots. The company initially began operations with the same product range back in 2014. However, over the years, it diversified its offerings, leading to a name change to Nuri in 2021. Prior to that, Bitwala also partnered with German neobank Solaris to provide licensed bank accounts and debit cards. Yet, challenges soon emerged.\n\n\"The chain of events started that I had a very serious accident in 2017. I was therefore in rehabilitation for almost two years and was the only one working remotely,\u201d Jan Goslicki, Bitwala\u2019s CXO told Decrypt. \u201c At the end of 2018, my co-founder and CEO J\u00f6rg von Minckwitz left the company; very few startups survive such an exit. Effectively, that meant two out of three founders were gone.\"\n\nThe global crypto market faced significant pressures last year due to various factors such as the war in Ukraine, economic headwinds, and rising interest rates. This, coupled with the collapse of the Terra crypto project and the bankruptcy of the U.S.-based crypto lending platform Celsius Network, shook investor confidence.\n\nNuri's referral program involving Celsius further compounded its troubles, first leading to the company slashing its workforce by 20% and ultimately filing for bankruptcy in August last year. By October 2022, Nuri officially curtailed operations, citing \u201cinsuperable\u201d challenges, which prevented the firm from raising new funds or finding an acquirer.\n\nStill, as Daiber says, it had nothing to do with Bitwala\u2019s core product.\n\n\u201cWe had 200,000 KYC\u2019ed customers and 50,000 monthly financially active users, decent revenue and great plans, just not enough money,\u201d Daiber told Decrypt. \u201cAnd that's also why we chose to rejuvenate the project because we know people use it, we know people want it and we have the numbers to back that up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitwala's relaunch was made possible with help from UK-based Claret Capital and several angel investors, as well as Striga Technology, an Estonia-based company building banking infrastructure for fintechs and digital assets services.\n\nAdditionally, over 150,000 devices still have the Bitwala app installed, with around 170 BTC and 2,300 ETH sitting in customers\u2019 wallets after the Nuri insolvency.\n\n\u201cWe know crypto winters are made for building and that's what we're doing,\u201d added Daiber. \u201cWe have a small, extremely talented team of senior engineers that have built the product over the last years, and we are building for the crypto natives. I assume that if we can build a product that works for them, and it's sufficiently secure for them then in the next bull run, we can take full advantage of that.\u201d"

        "title": "How bitcoin is revolutionizing cross-border transactions - Business Insider Africa",
        "content": "Funds movement between nations or cross-border remittances is vital to the global economy. Many people depend on the funds they receive from foreign business partners and relatives.\n\nTraditionally, people have relied on conventional remittance options, including transaction delays and high fees. However, Bitcoin is revolutionizing cross-border transactions due to its decentralized and borderless nature. This blog post explains how this cryptocurrency changes how people transact across borders.\n\nAdvantages of Using Bitcoin in Cross-border Transactions\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBitcoin users benefit from using it in cross-border transactions in several ways. Here are some of the reasons to use this cryptocurrency in international payments.\n\nImproved Transaction Speed\n\nBitcoin allows individuals to complete cross-border transfers almost immediately. Conventional financial service providers like banks take days or weeks to settle an international transaction. However, miners confirm a Bitcoin transaction within minutes. And it doesn\u2019t matter the recipient\u2019s or the sender\u2019s location. Bitcoin expedites financial transactions, which is vital in time-sensitive or critical circumstances.\n\nLow Transaction Costs\n\nMany people prefer Bitcoin over conventional payment methods because it\u2019s relatively cheaper. Completing a cryptocurrency transaction costs a small amount or nothing. Therefore, people can save money when sending money abroad or receiving it from foreign senders when using Bitcoin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFinancial Inclusivity\n\nThe traditional financial system has locked many people out of the banking system, especially in developing countries. That\u2019s because they lack the necessary infrastructure or do not qualify to open bank accounts. Bitcoin gives the underbanked and unbanked access to various financial services. Anybody with a smartphone that accesses the internet can set up a digital wallet and use it to complete financial transactions. Also, platforms like immediate alpha enable individuals to access and use Bitcoin in international trade.\n\nEnhanced Security\n\nMany people fear transacting internationally due to their exposure to fraud. For instance, some merchants fear engaging in global trade with payment methods like credit cards due to chargebacks. However, Bitcoin provides secure transactions due to its underlying technology. Blockchain protects Bitcoin users against transaction manipulation, fraud, and unauthorized funds access. Blockchain records all Bitcoin transactions on a transparent, unchangeable digital ledger. And this builds trust while increasing accountability.\n\nChallenges\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile Bitcoin brings numerous benefits to cross-border remittances, it has its drawbacks. Here are the primary challenges of using this cryptocurrency in cross-border transactions.\n\nDiffering Regulations\n\nBitcoin is legal in some countries, meaning citizens can use it in cross-border transactions. However, other nations strictly regulate and control Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Some have even banned Bitcoin use, mining, and trading. Therefore, individuals and organizations that want to use Bitcoin to transact internationally may need help in countries where Bitcoin is illegal.\n\nVolatility\n\nBitcoin and other virtual currencies are highly volatile. Their prices can fluctuate rapidly within a short period. Therefore, determining the amount you\u2019ll receive in fiat money when cashing out Bitcoin can be challenging. You can lose money if Bitcoin\u2019s value drops or make a profit if it increases. Therefore, volatility is among the primary challenge for Bitcoin use in international payments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLimited Knowledge\n\nSome people are yet to understand Bitcoin and how it functions. Some think it\u2019s a digital asset, while others see it as a currency. Also, some people need more time to understand crypto wallets and how to use private and public keys to receive and safeguard their Bitcoins. Until more people understand Bitcoin and its functioning, its use in cross-border transactions will remain limited.\n\nParting Shot\n\nBitcoin is transforming cross-border transactions. This virtual currency eliminates intermediaries, enabling users to send funds faster and affordably. Additionally, Bitcoin is straightforward due to the low entrance barrier since you can use it without opening a bank account. Thus, anybody with a smartphone can use it to set up a crypto wallet and transact with Bitcoin internationally. Nevertheless, challenges like volatility, ambiguous laws, and limited knowledge delay its adoption in cross-border transactions.\n\n--\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

        "title": "Govt releases 50L for SIT\u2019s Bitcoin case probe; team to look for expert support - The Times of India",
        "content": "Need for knowledge\n\nBENGALURU: The government has released Rs 50 lakh under the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (KTPP) Act to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Criminal Investigation Department formed to reinvestigate the Bitcoin case . This comes over two years after Bengaluru police clarified to a local court that they had not recovered 31 Bitcoins from hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki and that he had misled the interrogators by showing them a live wallet of a Bitcoin exchange.Police said the fund would be of great help in getting the support from experts that\u2019s required to probe the scandal that is not only a hitech crime but has international dimensions.Sriki was arrested by police in November 2020 on alleged charges of purchasing drugs from darknet using Bitcoins. Prior to his arrest, cops had arrested his associates and recovered 500 grams of marijuana from them. No cash was recovered either from Sriki or his associates.In January 2021, Sandeep Patil, then joint commissioner of police, Central Crime Branch, had announced that no Bitcoins had been transferred from Sriki's account, nor were any Bitcoins lost.\u201cAfter Sriki told us that his wallet had 31 Bitcoins, we decided to open an account for further investigation. We had taken permission from the government in January. During the investigation, cyber experts had found that the Bitcoin account, claimed to be opened by Sriki, was a live wallet of an exchange and he did not have a private key to it. The wallet was untouched and no Bitcoins were transferred to the police wallet,\u201d Sandeep Patil claimed. A report to this effect was also attached in the chargesheet against Sriki, running into 800 pages, and filed by then investigating officer Chandradhar.After the Congress government formed the SIT in July, an official filed an FIR last month against the then CCB officials and others in the case, claiming that electronic gadgets of Sriki were tampered with by addition of more files during the investigation.Now, with the government sanctioning Rs 50 lakh, SIT officials are ready to hire experts in cyber-forensic field and Bitcoins. \u201cThe probe demands deep knowledge of cybercrime as well as knowledge on Bitcoins. In this case, finding the roots of Bitcoins \u2014 from where they came and to where they went \u2014 are the most important factors. Once we begin the investigation, there will be unseen challenges for sure. Also, while tracking Bitcoin, we need to work with other countries. All these hurdles can be handled effectively if we are well equipped with experts,\u201d a senior officer said.Asked if any deadline is fixed to complete the probe, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll prefer completing it in reasonable time.\u201d"

        "title": "Pros and Cons of Using Bitcoin in Online Gambling - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The past decade has seen a surge in the popularity of cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin emerging as the most popular cryptocurrency. Various businesses in the online space, including e-commerce and online casinos, are now allowing their customers and clients to transact with Bitcoin.\n\nSome of the best Bitcoin gambling sites offer numerous advantages over traditional gambling, including added privacy and faster transactions. But, like with most things, using Bitcoin for online gambling presents a few limitations.\n\nThis article will take an in-depth look at both sides of the coin \u2018pun intended\u2019 to give you a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and limitations of gambling with Bitcoin.\n\nPros\n\nEnhanced Privacy\n\n71% of adults worldwide have taken measures to improve their online privacy. While these efforts are mainly centred around using VPNs and privacy settings on their devices, some have gone a step further to secure their transactions by using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to make transactions.\n\nTraditional fiat currency transactions have one major flaw \u2013 they require you to share much personal information. Whenever you make a transaction, various institutions, from your credit card company to third-party payment processors and gambling sites, have access to your data.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, provides an unprecedented level of anonymity. While you may have to provide some information when buying Bitcoin with your credit card, every other transaction you make with Bitcoin, including depositing and withdrawing funds from an online casino, remains anonymous.\n\nLower Transaction Costs\n\nFiat currency transactions often pass through several institutions before they get to your online casino. And, since everyone wants a cut, this often results in higher transaction costs. On the other hand, cryptocurrency transactions work through the blockchain, facilitating transactions directly from your crypto wallet to your online casino.\n\nThis results in much lower transaction costs for you and the online casino. Online crypto casinos often pass on the savings to their clients through bonuses and other incentives.\n\nSecurity and Fraud Prevention\n\nCryptocurrency transactions, including Bitcoin transactions, are highly secure due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. As long as you keep your crypto wallet keys private, there\u2019s no way anyone can access your funds.\n\nOnline casinos also benefit from the reduced risk of chargebacks, fraud, and other payment-related issues, thus giving you and the online casino peace of mind.\n\nCons\n\nVolatility\n\nThe value of cryptocurrencies is subject to significant fluctuations. While the increased volatility may lead to increased profits in case of a market upturn, it could also work against you. For instance, if you buy Bitcoins at a higher value and then withdraw your winnings at a lower value, you may make a financial loss.\n\nSteep Learning Curve\n\nYou need to be at least moderately tech-savvy to use Bitcoin effectively. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, crypto is a bit more complex and may require some learning before you understand how it works.\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty\n\nThe regulatory uncertainty around crypto is alarming, to say the least. Different countries enact new regulations every other day, making it difficult to keep track of crypto progress. Actually, some countries have even banned it altogether. Failure to adhere to set regulations may leave both you and the online casino liable to legal action.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDespite its popularity and widespread adoption in online gambling, Bitcoin has a few drawbacks. However, aside from the legal aspect, choosing to use Bitcoin for online gambling ultimately depends on your preferences, especially where your privacy and financial security are concerned.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC) starting the week on a bullish note, much like the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency market, experts predict more gains to come, and some are confident that the maiden digital asset will surpass $100,000 in the next couple of years.\n\nAs it happens, pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst PlanB, a.k.a. 100trillionUSD, reiterated the prognosis from earlier this year, arguing that Bitcoin\u2019s halving event could trigger its move above $32,000, with the 2025 bull market culminating at $100,000 and beyond, in an X post published on September 18.\n\nIndeed, as the expert pointed out, the November 2022 low was the bottom for Bitcoin, expecting it to rise towards the 2024 halving, particularly as it has already risen from $18,000 to $27,000 since January 12, when PlanB made the original prediction.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s realized price. Source: 100trillionUSD\n\nTherefore, the analyst believes that the 2024 halving will bring the largest crypto asset into a price range between $23,000 and $66,000, whereas the subsequent bull market in 2025 could trigger the run toward the range between $100,000 and as much as $1 million per unit.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at the price of $27,320, indicating a gain of 2.84% on the day, while increasing its value by 6.43% across the previous week, and advancing 5.41% on its monthly chart, according to the information retrieved on September 18.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nNotably, Bitcoin has crossed a bullish cross for the first time in over a year, a bullish sign that has demonstrated itself in the recent recovery. Additionally, it still has 29 halving events remaining, each of them carrying the possibility of another rally.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) community\u2019s HODLing culture is taken seriously by some known entities that are firmly holding their own Bitcoin stash in these over 15 years of existence of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nOn September 19, Finbold collected data from multiple sources in order to provide an updated analysis of the current state of known Bitcoin holders in the world. Most of the consolidated data used in this story was provided by Arkham Intelligence and the Buy Bitcoin Worldwide website.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto holdings (estimations): 750,000 to 1.1 million BTC Binance holdings: 643,546 BTC Grayscale holdings: 627,779 BTC US Government holdings: 207,189 BTC Mt. Gox holdings: 200,000 BTC Bitfinex holdings: 196,252 BTC China Government holdings: 194,000 BTC MicroStrategy holdings: 152,800 BTC Block.one holdings: 140,000 BTC Robinhood holdings: 118,300 BTC\n\nTogether, these top 10 Bitcoin holders have 3,479,866 (3.48 million) BTC. Accounting for 16.5% of the maximum supply of 21 million BTC, or 17.8% of the current circulating supply of 19.49 million BTC, by press time.\n\nBitcoin circulating supply on September 19, 2023. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nBitcoin holdings by the top 5 largest known entities explained\n\nNotably, it is impossible to know the exact amount of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, but the above estimations are the most accepted by renowned researchers, according to BTC mining data from the early days, suggesting the creator of Bitcoin was able to mine around 22,000 blocks.\n\nWhile Binance is the second largest holder, its holdings are mostly made of third-party ownership using the centralized exchange to custody their coins that are ready to be traded. Grayscale holdings are mostly made of reserves for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with the on-chain proofs recently revealed by Arkham.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the United States Bitcoin holdings are mostly made of seized assets from regulatory crackdowns against businesses, or from criminal activities such as hackings, financial fraudulent schemes, and money laundering activities.\n\nMt. Gox is probably one of the most monitored Bitcoin holders in history, as the remaining stash is locked by a Tokyo Court ruling on the Mt. Gox case, which will supposedly be used to pay the crashed exchange\u2019s creditors. With recurrent delays and speculation about when they will be released for a possible sell-off."

        "content": "Breaking news from the BlackRock company, which, according to some rumors, appears to have purchased 12,200 Bitcoin, shaking up adoption within the crypto world in no small part.\n\nBreaking news: Bitcoin continues to capture the interest of institutional investors, BlackRock at the forefront\n\nAs anticipated, recent rumors are stirring the blockchain world, suggesting that BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s largest investment management firms, may have made a massive investment in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn fact, according to some sources, BlackRock has reportedly acquired a total of 12,200 Bitcoin, marking a significant step in institutional adoption of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAs is often the case, these rumors have sparked a frenzy of speculation within the cryptocurrency community and financial investors.\n\nIndeed, if the news turns out to be true, it would represent an unprecedented vote of confidence in Bitcoin\u2018s future from one of the world\u2019s most influential financial institutions.\n\nAs we know, BlackRock is no stranger to the world of cryptocurrencies, having explored and closely monitored the sector in recent years.\n\nHowever, an investment of this magnitude would mark a significant shift in the firm\u2019s investment strategy, with Bitcoin becoming a more prominent part of its global portfolio.\n\nThis development reflects institutional investors\u2019 growing interest in cryptocurrencies as a potentially lucrative asset class. Bitcoin, in particular, has attracted attention due to its growing adoption and deflationary nature.\n\nWhile BlackRock has not yet officially confirmed these rumors, the news has already catalyzed further discussion about regulation and Bitcoin\u2019s increasing integration into mainstream financial markets.\n\nWhether this monumental investment will mark the beginning of a new era for cryptocurrencies in the global financial world remains to be seen.\n\nMore rumors: the false claim about BlackRock\u2019s interest in XRP\n\nRecently, news has been circulating about BlackRock\u2019s alleged intention to shift its interest in the crypto world from Bitcoin to XRP.\n\nThis news originated from a dubious social media account and was spread without any verification.\n\nThe origin of this uproar seems to go back to a tweet from an account known to spread unverified news, WallStreetBulls, which speculated about an alleged \u201cshift in institutional trust to more sustainable and efficient digital assets.\u201d\n\nThis speculation was then amplified by an article on Investing.com, which claimed that BlackRock was reassessing its position on Bitcoin in favor of XRP, without citing any reliable sources.\n\nHowever, careful verification revealed that this rumor was baseless and the enthusiasm in the XRP community was unfounded.\n\nAlthough some members of the crypto community have urged caution, urging investors to demand hard evidence, there is no credible evidence to suggest an actual change of interest by BlackRock from Bitcoin to XRP.\n\nAs we know, BlackRock has shown increasing interest in the cryptocurrency market, including a call for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, all of these initiatives indicate a general interest in digital assets, rather than a specific focus on one cryptocurrency in particular.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink also acknowledged the cryptocurrency sector\u2019s potential for financial revolution, marking a shift from his previous skepticism.\n\nIt remains to be seen how BlackRock\u2019s interest in cryptocurrency will develop in the coming months."

        "title": "Mark Yusko predicts a \"parabolic top\" for Bitcoin price with $300 billion after the advent of the ETF - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The founder of Morgan Creek Capital, recently had his say on the possibility of a parabolic rise in the price of Bitcoin in succession to the approval of ETFs.\n\nMorgan Creek Capital founder and his hypothesis on the price of Bitcoin once ETFs are approved\n\nIn the ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape, Bitcoin has consistently proven to be the pioneer and leader. Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital, recently shared his insights on the future of Bitcoin in an interview with Paul Barron Network.\n\nAccording to Yusko, Bitcoin is poised for a parabolic rise, led by an institutional capital inflow of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nWe delve into Yusko\u2019s analysis, the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle and the potential impact of ETF approval on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe halving cycle and the price trajectory of Bitcoin\n\nYusko\u2019s analysis begins with an examination of Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle, a crucial event that occurs every four years.\n\nDuring this event, the rewards given to Bitcoin miners are halved, reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin is generated.\n\nThe next halving is scheduled for April 2024. Yusko highlights an intriguing pattern observed in Bitcoin\u2019s price history: after each halving, Bitcoin tends to add a zero to its price.\n\nFor example, after the first halving, the price went from $100 to $1,000.\n\nSubsequently, after the second halving, it rose from $1,000 to $10,000.\n\nAccording to this pattern, the next logical step would be to reach a fair value of $100,000. Currently trading at $26,000, Bitcoin appears to be on a rapid trajectory toward this fair value.\n\nThe parabolic Blow-Off Top phenomenon\n\nWhat makes Yusko\u2019s analysis particularly interesting, however, is his mention of the \u201cparabolic top,\u201d which tends to occur after each half-life cycle.\n\nIn the previous cycle, Bitcoin\u2019s fair value was estimated at around $30,000, but it eventually rose to $69,000.\n\nThis dramatic increase was largely attributed to excessive leverage, speculative trading, and rampant gambling in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nYusko, however, offers a more conservative estimate for the current cycle.\n\nHe suggests that instead of seeing a 2 or 2.5-fold increase, Bitcoin could experience a 1.5-fold surge this time around. This is indicative of a more cautious and calculated approach by investors and market participants.\n\nThe role of Bitcoin ETFs as catalysts for the price increase\n\nOne of the key catalysts that Yusko believes will drive Bitcoin\u2019s rise is the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Bitcoin.\n\nHe predicts that these ETFs could gain regulatory approval by late 2023 or early 2024. Once this is achieved, it could pave the way for a massive influx of capital into the cryptocurrency space.\n\nYusko\u2019s estimate is bold: He predicts that about $300 billion in capital could flow into Bitcoin after the approval of a spot ETF.\n\nThis influx of capital could be a game changer, as a significant portion of Bitcoin\u2019s supply is held by long-term investors or remains dormant.\n\nThe combination of increased demand and limited supply could push the price of Bitcoin to unprecedented levels.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, Mark Yusko\u2019s analysis presents an interesting perspective on the future of Bitcoin. His observation of Bitcoin\u2019s historical price patterns following halving events, along with the potential impact of ETF approval, offers valuable insights for investors and enthusiasts.\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile and unpredictable, Yusko\u2019s assessment suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s journey to new heights may be well underway, thanks to institutional investment and a cautious market approach.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, only time will tell if his predictions come true."
