        "content": "On every Mac operating system post 2018, a nine-page PDF is hidden inside a nest of folders. That PDF is none other than the Bitcoin white paper, the famed theoretical outline of the cryptocurrency authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous inventor.\n\nOn Wednesday, Andy Baio, former CTO of Kickstarter, was the first to publicly announce that he had found the squirreled-away PDF after he tried to connect a combination printer-scanner to his MacBook.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked over a dozen Mac-using friends to confirm, and it was there for every one of them,\u201d he wrote on his more than two decades old blog. He thinks the white paper\u2019s inclusion was the work of a single engineer, rather than an Easter egg ordained from on high.\n\nWhile Baio has been a techie for decades, it\u2019s relatively simple to find the same document on your very own Mac. Here\u2019s how:\n\nUsing Terminal\n\nEvery iteration of the Mac operating system has what\u2019s called Terminal, or a way to explore a computer\u2019s file system through text commands. To access Terminal on your Mac, simply go to the Applications folder, then open the Utilities folder, and click on it.\n\nBaio wrote a simple command for Mac users to reveal the hidden Bitcoin white paper. Copy and paste the following code into Terminal once it\u2019s open:\n\nopen /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf\n\nUsing Finder\n\nThe more time-intensive approach\u2014but one with a technologically lower bar\u2014is to navigate through Finder, a Mac\u2019s file management system.\n\nOpen a Finder window, navigate to the System folder, and prepare yourself for a deluge of clicks.\n\nFrom Systems, go to Library, Image Capture, and then Devices. Once in Devices, right click on VirtualScanner and choose Show Package Contents. That should open up another folder titled Contents, through which you should navigate to Resources, which will reveal a number of files.\n\nClick on simpledoc.pdf, and voil\u00e0! You should finally have arrived at your destination: the nine-page outline that detailed the theoretical specifications of Bitcoin, a piece of digital dust that, in aggregate, is worth well over $500 billion as of Friday afternoon."

        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto is said to be the inventor of bitcoin and wrote the token's original white paper in 2008.\n\nCrypto fans this week celebrated Nakamoto's 48th birthday amid new theories as to their true identity.\n\nHere's what to know about the mysterious icon behind the world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the name of the individual or group credited with inventing bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency. Their legend is shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe inventor's identity has never been confirmed, though April 5 marked their 48th birthday, according to information on a profile with The P2P Foundation.\n\nThis week, conspiracy theories connected the figure to the late Steve Jobs, the visionary Apple cofounder, following the revelation that Apple has shipped out Mac computers since 2018 with a copy of the original bitcoin white paper.\n\n\"While trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018,\" technologist Andy Baio wrote in an April 5 blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNakamoto's paper, \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" was published in October 2008. The abstract reads:\n\n\"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\"\n\nSince then, bitcoin has become the largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of about $540 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data on Friday.\n\nWhat we know about Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nSomeone is behind the name, given that they invented bitcoin's complex source code, authored a white paper, and interacted with users on web forums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNakamoto's profile on The P2P Foundation lists their location as Japan. In their posts, however, Nakamoto has used British English spellings and expressions, leading some to assume they are in fact not Japanese, as the inventor claimed. Additionally, some have pointed to the time stamps on Nakamoto's comments as reason to believe they were not located in Japan.\n\nIn 2011, a comment from that account stated that they had \"moved onto other things.\"\n\nThe name is also associated with a number of crypto wallets, presumably owned by Nakamoto. Some estimate that those wallets hold more than 1.1 million bitcoin tokens. When bitcoin peaked in November 2021 at $68,000, those holdings would have been worth about $73 billion, placing Nakamoto among the 15 riches people in the world at the time.\n\nSome have speculated that the chances Nakamoto is one person are low, given the complexity of bitcoin's source code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Either there's a team of people who worked on this or this guy is a genius,\" Dan Kaminsky, a leading internet-security researcher, told The New Yorker in 2011.\n\nIn his white paper, Nakamoto cited the work of Stuart Haber, a computer scientist credited with helping invent blockchain technology. Haber has echoed Kaminsky's sentiment that the programmer behind bitcoin would have had a \"keen intelligence.\"\n\nOther names that have been connected to Nakamoto\n\nIn 2013, Nick Szabo, a computer scientist who published research in 1998 on \"bit gold,\" a precursor to bitcoin, drew attention for potentially being Nakamoto. He has denied it, and financial writer Dominic Frisby has said no proof exists connecting the two figures.\n\n\"The most convincing evidence pointed to a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent named Nick Szabo,\" journalist Nathaniel Popper wrote in The New York Times in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Newsweek article in 2014 said that Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, was the elusive inventor of bitcoin. According to the article, he was trained as a physicist and worked on classified defense projects, but he, too, denied the claims.\n\nAfter the article published, Nakamoto's online account revived itself after a five-year hiatus, stating: \"I am not Dorian Nakamoto.\"\n\nThen, in December 2015, Wired posited that Australian researcher Craig Steven Wright \"either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.\"\n\nThe same day, Gizmodo published a story that said Wright, as well as computer scientist Dave Kleiman, together were involved in the invention of bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in May 2016, Wright announced in a blog post that he did create bitcoin, though he was met with prominent crypto figures who said it was false.\n\nThe list of other potential candidates, apart from Apple's Jobs, includes the government, various other computer scientists, and even Elon Musk, who denied he was Nakamoto in a 2017 tweet.\n\nOn Friday, bitcoin hovered around $27,937. It has surged 68% in 2023."

        "title": "What's a Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The debate between Bitcoin (BTC 0.53%) and Ethereum (ETH -0.42%) as a better investment has been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency community for years. Both are popular and established cryptocurrencies, but there are key differences between them that make Bitcoin a better investment. The reason for this belief can be boiled down to three simple reasons.\n\n1. The market cap difference\n\nMarket capitalization, or \"market cap,\" refers to the total value of a company or asset. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by the current market price of each coin. As of April 1, 2023, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $545 billion, while Ethereum's market cap is just under $220 billion.\n\nEssentially what this means is that Bitcoin is currently a more established asset than Ethereum and makes up a disproportionate amount of value in the entire crypto asset class. As of today, Bitcoin accounts for more than 45% of all the value in crypto.\n\nIts higher market cap indicates that it has more adoption and more trust among investors. Additionally, it suggests that Bitcoin is less volatile than Ethereum, as it would take a larger amount of money to move its price significantly.\n\n2. Increasing scarcity\n\nOne of the most significant differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum is their supply. Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, which means that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in circulation. Currently, there are around 19.3 million circulating, with the remaining 1.7 million yet to be mined. Even better, though, these remaining 1.7 million bitcoins will be released at a diminishing rate for the next 117 years until the last bitcoin is mined.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin's inflation rate is a minimal 1.7%. However, due to the gradual decrease in the rate of new coins being created, it is estimated that by 2056, this number will fall below 0.1%. By the year 2100, Bitcoin's inflation rate will be somewhere around 0.000001%. No matter the asset, an inflation rate this low helps to ensure that prices are not only maintained but grow as demand competes for a more limited supply.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has no hard cap. While it does have a mechanism known as burning to remove ether from circulation, there is, technically, no overall limit on the number of ether which could enter the market. Unlike Bitcoin, this means that Ethereum is subject to unknown levels of inflation, which can decrease the value of each individual coin over time.\n\n3. Decentralization and security\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has a stronger track record when it comes to security and decentralization. Bitcoin's blockchain is the most secure and decentralized of any cryptocurrency, with thousands of nodes and miners around the world helping to verify transactions and maintain the network. This makes it less susceptible to hacking or manipulation than Ethereum, which has had several high-profile security incidents in the past. Additionally, Bitcoin's decentralized nature means that it is not subject to the same level of centralization or regulation as Ethereum, which has been criticized for being too closely tied to its founders and developers.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin has a more established and secure network than Ethereum. Bitcoin's network has been operating securely for well over a decade, and its underlying proof-of-work technology has proven to be reliable and resistant to attacks. Ethereum, on the other hand, has had some security issues in the past, including a major hack in 2016 that resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of ether. While Ethereum's security has improved over time, it still lags behind Bitcoin in terms of reliability and security.\n\nKeep it simple\n\nWhile Ethereum might be deserving of a spot in your portfolio, Bitcoin provides investors with a safer and more dependable option. Likely the greatest advantage Bitcoin has over Ethereum is its simplicity. Bitcoin's value proposition is clear and easy to understand: it is a highly decentralized and secure digital store of value that provides holders with reliability.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a more complex value proposition that is tied to its smart contract functionality and decentralized applications. While this complexity can be appealing to some investors, it also makes Ethereum more difficult to understand and evaluate as an investment, as many of these use cases are in their beginning stages.\n\nFor investors looking to keep it simple and wanting to invest in cryptocurrency, look no further than the original digital asset, Bitcoin."

The company, founded in 2015, had grown to employ more than 200 people in four offices around the world, with $5 billion traded on Paxful by more than 12 million users over the course of its existence, according to court filings."

        "content": "Technologist Andy Baio wrote this week that he discovered a PDF of the original bitcoin white paper on his Mac.\n\nThe revelation fueled theories connecting Steve Jobs to the mysterious author of the paper, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nBaio said Apple appears to have hid the bitcoin document in \"every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.\"\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an April 5 blog post, technologist Andy Baio said he accidentally stumbled upon a copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper on his Mac computer, with the revelation fueling wild theories across the internet that the mysterious creator of the world's biggest cryptocurrency was Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.\n\n\"While trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018,\" Baio wrote.\n\nHis post prompted Twitter users to share screenshots of the same manifesto stored on their Macs. Insider also tested out Baio's instructions and found the white paper on the latest version of macOS.\n\nThe white paper, titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" was published in 2008. In it, the author lays out the framework for the underlying mechanisms that power bitcoin and enable transactions without a third party intermediary like a bank or financial institution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaio's revelation fueled fresh speculation that Nakamoto, the mysterious bitcoin inventor who has never been identified, may have been Steve Jobs, the late co-founder of Apple and tech visionary.\n\n\"Was Steve Jobs actually Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of #bitcoin?\" tweeted Lark Davis, a bitcoin investor and blogger with 1.1 million followers. \"Plus Satoshi disappear in December 2010, and then Jobs passed in October 2011. The timelines fit...\"\n\nWhile Nakamoto vanished from the internet around the same time Jobs died, the white paper appeared on Mac computers seven years after the tech icon's death, making it impossible for him to be the one who inserted the document into the OS.\n\nOther users chimed in across Twitter, with some agreeing while others remained skeptical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile unusual, the presence of the bitcoin white paper on Mac computers isn't evidence of anything.\n\nAs for Jobs himself, while he is credited as the creative force behind many of Apple's most iconic products, he wasn't an expert programmer, according to co-founder, Steve Wozniak.\n\nOthers have also noted that for Jobs to develop the iPhone around the same time as the world's most popular digital asset is more reason to be skeptical.\n\nThe real identity of Nakamoto has never been revealed, and some believe Nakamoto was actually a group of people given the complexity of bitcoin's code. The inventor stated they started writing the code for bitcoin in 2007, and the network launched in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mysterious figure \"disappeared\" from online appearances on December 12, 2010.\n\nSome estimate that crypto wallets associated with the pseudonym hold more than 1.1 million bitcoin tokens. When the token peaked in November 2021 at about $68,000, those holdings would have been worth roughly $73 billion, putting Nakamoto among the top-15 richest people in the world at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, other Twitter users floated the idea that the white paper was simply a bitcoin enthusiast working at Apple who slipped the document in as an easter egg.\n\nTo locate the white paper, users can open the macOS terminal and enter the following command:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nopen /System/Library/Image\\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf\n\nOn Friday, bitcoin hovered around $27,896. The token has rallied roughly 68% in 2023."

        "content": "A bill seeking to regulate Bitcoin (BTC) mining activity in Arkansas has passed in the state\u2019s House of Representatives and Senate. The bill will now move to the governor\u2019s office for approval.\n\nAccording to the bill, the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 intends to regulate the Bitcoin mining industry in the American state, creating guidelines for miners and protecting them from discriminatory regulations and taxes.\n\nArkansas\u2019 state legislators quickly passed the bill after it was proposed on March 30 by Senator Joshua Bryant. The document recognizes \u201cthat data centers create jobs, pay taxes, and provide general economic value to local communities.\u201c\n\nArkansas Data Centers Act of 2023. Source: Arkansas State Legislature\n\nAs per the approved bill, a digital asset miner is required \u201cto pay applicable taxes and government fees in acceptable forms of currency and operate in a manner that causes no stress on an electric public utility\u2019s generation capabilities or transmission network.\u201c\n\nUnder the legislation, crypto miners will also have the same rights as data centers. The bill outlines that Arkansas\u2019 government should not \u201cimpose a different requirement for a digital asset mining business than is applicable to any requirement for a data center.\u201c\n\nRelated: Crypto mining in 2023 \u2014 Is it still worth it? Watch Market Talks\n\nArkansas\u2019 move follows a similar initiative in the state of Montana. In late March, the Montana Senate passed a bill to protect crypto miners operating within the state. The bill intends to protect miners against taxes on digital assets used for payments, and to eliminate energy rates discriminating against home crypto miners and digital assets businesses.\n\nThe state of Texas went in a different direction. Its Senate Committee on Business and Commerce passed legislation on April 4 that would essentially remove incentives for miners operating under the state\u2019s crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Cointelegraph reported.\n\nAn even more decisive move came from New York in November 2022 when Governor Kathy Hochul signed the proof-of-work mining moratorium into law, banning crypto-mining activities in the state for two years. On a federal level, crypto miners in the United States could eventually be subject to a 30% tax on electricity costs under a budget proposal introduced on March 9 by President Joe Biden aimed to \u201creduce mining activity.\u201d\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 0.96% from March 31 to April 7 to trade at US$27,916 at 9:15 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether rose 2.54% in the same period to US$1,854.\n\nThis week, worries about bank failures were replaced by concerns about a recession in the U.S. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 236,000 in March, the lowest monthly gain since December 2020 and less than the 239,000 expected by economists polled by Reuters. Pay growth also slowed.\n\nThe stuttering in job growth and pay was linked to weak consumer demand and the rising cost of borrowing. Add to that a forecast by the International Monetary Fund that said global GDP is expected to grow by around 3% over the next five years, the slowest pace in 20 years.\n\nAnother bearish indicator for the U.S. economy released Wednesday was the services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for March that came in at 51.2%, according to the Institute for Supply Management, also well below expectation of 54.5%. The index is a measure of market conditions, with a lower reading suggesting a contracting economy.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said Bitcoin is still suffering from bear market blues and price trends are mixed.\n\n\u201cNormally, we see risk on conditions as something that drives up the Bitcoin price. But, over the last month with the banking crisis, we\u2019ve actually seen risk off be positive for Bitcoin. Right now, the price action is telling us the market is undecided,\u201d Stadelmann said in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nStablecoin reserves on exchanges continued to drop this week, hitting a two-year low of US$18.06 billion, according to data from analytics platform CryptoQuant, hinting that crypto market liquidity is drying up after the shutdown of three major crypto-focused banks in the U.S.\n\nTether\u2019s USDT added more than US$1 billion to its stablecoins-leading market capitalization this week, raising it toUS$80.27 billion. Its market cap is up 11.92% over the past month, while rival USDC\u2019s dropped 25.03% to US$32.41 billion, as BUSD lost 15.91% to US$7.09 billion, according to DefiLlama.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.18 trillion on Friday at 9:15 p.m. in Hong Kong, the same value it had a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$539 billion market cap accounted for 45.9% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$223 billion accounted for 19%.\n\nSee related article: Ethereum\u2019s Shapella upgrade is imminent \u2013 and investors are excited\n\nBiggest gainers: INJ & ENJ\n\nINJ, the native governance token of Injective, a layer-1 smart contract blockchain for financial apps, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. INJ rose 23.17% during the past week to trade at US$5.77. The token started gaining momentum in early March since launching the ongoing Injective Global Hackathon.\n\nEnjin Coin, the utility token of Enjin, a blockchain platform building non-fungible token solutions, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer in the top 100. ENJ rose 19.68% to change hands at US$0.47. The token started its rally on Tuesday, ahead of the release of the upcoming Enjin Platform, which the company teased on social media.\n\nNext week: Will Bitcoin claim US$30,000?\n\nStadelmann said that Bitcoin could break through US$30,000 briefly in the coming week but cautioned that a recession might be looming.\n\nWhen this sinks in, some panic selling will start in Bitcoin, but like during the Covid-19 panic, Bitcoin will rebound rather quickly, he said. \u201cThe bank runs we have seen in recent months build the case for Bitcoin. They are why Bitcoin was built.\u201d\n\nMarat Minkin, the co-founder of decentralized finance payment app TONBanking, said that regulatory developments and economic data will continue to dictate the crypto market trend next week.\n\nThe U.S. is scheduled to release key inflation numbers next week. According to Minkin, Bitcoin is a safe haven asset to hedge against inflation and recession.\n\n(Updates to add economic indicators in first section.)\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin trades under US$28,000, Dogecoin biggest loser"

Source: TradingView/Mags\n\nBTC\u2019s price broke above the $16,000\u2013$25,000 range in March 2023, prompting Mags to highlight its resemblance to the breakout above the $200\u2013$300 range in October 2015.\n\nSince this resulted in a rally toward $700 in June 2016, the analyst sees the scenario potentially repeating in 2023, with BTC\u2019s price doubling to $50,000.\n\n\u201cBeing bearish here [when Bitcoin\u2019s price is around $28,000] is like being bearish at $350,\u201d Mags added.\n\nLiquidity crunch may spoil Bitcoin price rally\n\nThe bullish argument for Bitcoin comes amid anticipations that the United States Federal Reserve would slow the pace of its interest rate hikes.\n\nDue to lower rate expectations, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note has declined. That, in turn, has boosted investors\u2019 appetite for zero-yielding assets, such as Bitcoin and gold.\n\nU.S. 10-year weekly chart versus BTC/USD and XAU/USD. Source: TradingView\n\nIn addition, lower yields have also sapped U.S. dollar demand, with the dollar losing 1.33% in 2023 versus a basket of top foreign currencies. Since Bitcoin\u2019s value is largely denominated in the dollar, it means higher prices for BTC/USD.\n\nRelated: Latest Bitcoin price data suggests double top above $200K in 2025\n\nHowever, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone has cautioned about a potential bull trap in the Bitcoin market due to a mounting liquidity crunch.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cIt may be illogical to expect the stock market, crude oil, copper, and the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) sustain the recent bounces with year-over-year measures of money supply and commercial bank deposits falling around 2%.\u201d\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Those traders reverted the trend, aggressively buying Bitcoin using leverage for the past two days as the long-to-short ratio returned to 0.97.\n\nAbsence of Bitcoin shorts is a bullish indicator\n\nIn essence, both the Bitcoin margin and futures markets are currently neutral, which should be interpreted positively given that the Bitcoin price rose 41.5% between March 10 and March 20, holding the $28,000 level.\n\nGiven the enormous regulatory uncertainty caused by the SEC\u2019s Wells notice against Coinbase on March 22, the absence of shorts using margin and futures markets currently favors further price appreciation.\n\nUnless the economic crisis unfolds faster than expected, inflation will remain a top concern for investors, and Bitcoin inflows should be enough to keep $28,000 as a resistance level.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Bitcoin leads crypto market recovery as regulators turn up heat: Report - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "March has been a turbulent month for the crypto industry. Bitcoin (BTC) recorded its highest weekly close in 10 months and raised hopes among many that the bear market is over. One of the key drivers of this expectation was a series of banking collapses in the United States. This made investors hope for falling interest rates later this year, despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s insistence that lower rates were not part of the base scenario for 2023.\n\nHowever, optimism about the macro environment risks being offset by the regulatory crackdown on the industry in the United States. This mixed environment is markedly different from the typical bull and bear market action that the crypto industry is used to and affects its various areas in different ways.\n\nFor those serious about understanding the crypto space\u2019s various sectors, Cointelegraph Research publishes a monthly Investors Insights Report that dives into venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulation and much more. Compiled by leading experts on these various topics, the monthly reports are an invaluable tool to quickly get a sense of the current state of the blockchain industry.\n\nDownload and purchase this month\u2019s report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nVCs put off by looming stagflation\n\nInvestment activity in the blockchain industry experienced a significant decline in March, according to the latest information from the Cointelegraph Research Venture Capital database, as only 59 individual deals took place, down from 96 in February. This represents a 38.5% decrease in investment activity. The total aggregate capital inflows for March were $504 million, a drop of over 42.7% from February\u2019s figure of $880 million.\n\nVCs require stable and favorable macroeconomic conditions that can support the growth of high-risk ventures. The risk of a long-term stagflationary environment makes it difficult to achieve this, which is why VC investment sentiment has recently tended toward being bearish. Until there is a shift in macroeconomic indicators that turn investors from risk-off to risk-on, there may continue to be a stagnant or decreasing investment sentiment in the blockchain industry.\n\nHowever, there were still some notable investment rounds in March, including $50 million for Ethereum layer-2 solution Scroll, $40 million for surveillance-free internet builder DAO tomi, and a $40-million seed round for CCP Games. Overall, the report rates the investment sentiment for the blockchain industry as 3 out of 5, indicating that VC investment is still being hampered by macro factors. However, VC activity is likely to be a lagging indicator in any future recovery.\n\nMining stocks ahead of the pack\n\nCrypto stocks saw a mixed performance in March. While mining operations boosted their share price due to higher revenues, other types of crypto ventures struggled. This included the likes of Coinbase, Canaan and Block. The latter\u2019s price continued to be impacted by the short-selling attack by Hindenburg Research.\n\nOn the mining front, the highest gains were recorded by Riot Platforms at 60%, Cipher Mining at 53%, and Terwulf, which now runs a nuclear-powered mining facility providing it with cheap electricity, at 47%. These top performers compare favorably to the MoM return on BTC at 23.0% and a 20.4% uptick in mining revenues. However, on aggregate, crypto stocks still significantly underperformed Bitcoin.\n\nThe crypto industry is likely to operate in a more profitable environment with a more benign outlook for interest rates and reduced debt obligations for mining firms in the coming months.\n\nYet the macroeconomic outlook remains shaky, with markets likely to continue a risk-off approach. With new information arriving with Q1 2023 results, investors will be paying close attention to financial reports for any indication of strength or weakness in the crypto industry.\n\nThe Cointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry.

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai hard fork: ETH price set for more gains versus Bitcoin in April - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) dropped by over 7.5% in its Bitcoin (BTC) pair in 2023. But ETH/BTC may wipe its year-to-date losses entirely in April, as Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai hard fork is just days away.\n\nThe upgrade is set for April 12, enabling Ethereum stakers to withdraw around 1.1 billion ETH in rewards \u2014 worth over $2 billion as of April 8.\n\nETH price undergoes key technical bounce\n\nMany experts see the hard fork as bullish for Ether in the long term. For instance, the Shanghai buzz has helped Ether outperform Bitcoin in April.\n\nAs a result, the ETH/BTC pair has risen by about 4.75% month-to-date to reach 0.066 BTC as of April 8, a nearly 8% rebound since March 20.\n\nThe bounce was largely expected, particularly as ETH/BTC dropped to its historical ascending trendline support. Now, the upside move raises the prospects of an extended bullish retracement toward its descending trendline resistance, marked as a \u201csell zone\u201d in the chart below.\n\nETH/BTC three-day price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe fractal-based outlook puts Ether on target for 0.075 BTC by June, up 10% versus current price levels. Meanwhile, the pair\u2019s upside target for April appears to be its 50-3D exponential moving average (50-3D EMA; the red wave) near 0.069 BTC.\n\nConversely, a decisive close below the 200-3D EMA (the blue wave) near 0.066 BTC, coinciding support/resistance level near 0.067 BTC, risks delaying or \u2014 in the worst case scenario \u2014 invalidating the bullish retracement setup.\n\nThis bearish argument echoes independent market analyst CrediBULL Crypto who expects strong selling pressure near the 0.067 BTC resistance level that would lead to a 50% drop in 2023.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView/CrediBULL Crypto\n\nEthereum vs. U.S. dollar outlook\n\nThe ETH/USD pair has rallied by more than 50% in 2023, primarily due to similar uptrends elsewhere in the crypto market.\n\nA weakening dollar, lower U.S. Treasury yields and expectations of a Federal Reserve pivot on interest rate hikes have helped cryptocurrencies rise across the board in Q1. These catalysts will likely remain in the spotlight until May\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\n\nShanghai bringing the first greenshoots of #AltcoinSeason ?$ETH is perking up to an 8 month high as we approach one week until the Shanghai fork update @ 10:27:35 PM UTC on the 12th (Epoch #620,9536)\n\n\n\nThe rally has mostly been a Fed/USD rates story, causing BTC to lead the way.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dI0bpywR16 \u2014 Rich Rosenblum (@Rich_GSR) April 4, 2023\n\nAs a result, Ether could sustain its yearly gains in April, consolidating inside the $1,800\u20132,000 range until the Fed decision.\n\nRelated: 3 key Ethereum price metrics cast doubt on the strength of ETH\u2019s recent rally\n\nMoreover, a decisive breakout at current levels could result in extended gains with a second-quarter ETH price target of over $3,000.\n\nETH/USD three-day price chart.

        "content": "Got Bitcoin ink? Many Bitcoin believers do. But what are the risks? What about privacy? And what happens if \u2014 one fateful day \u2014 Bitcoin crashes and burns to zero?\n\nCointelegraph spoke with Bitcoin (BTC) advocates to understand why they have permanently etched a Bitcoin logo, motif, equation or slogan onto their skin. They\u2019ve shown permanent solidarity with the decentralized movement, expressing their support for the Bitcoin protocol and the values it represents.\n\nTaihuttu's Bitcoin B tatto. Source Taihuttu.\n\nDidi Taihuttu, father of the \u201cBitcoin family,\u201d explained that he inked himself the moment he went \u201call in on Bitcoin as I thought it was a very important step in my life.\u201d A familiar face among the crypto community, Taihuttu sold all of his family\u2019s possessions and slept in a campsite while the price of Bitcoin was in the four-figure territory with the \u201cB\u201d etched on his arm.\n\nHe now travels the world evangelizing Bitcoin, with his forearm on full view:\n\n\u201cBitcoin changed my way of thinking about the world and decentralizing it.\u201d\n\nAnita Posch, another globetrotting Bitcoin evangelist, has a lightning bolt tattooed on her forearm. In the Human B Bitcoin documentary film, she said she wouldn\u2019t explain that the lightning bolt symbol (a nod to the Lightning Network) on her wrist is Bitcoin-related but added \u201cBitcoin is my life\u201d in follow-up comments.\n\nTatumTurnUp and Erik Dale have the Bitcoin supply formula on their skin. Source: Tatum\n\nTatumTurnUP (not his real name), the host of the Bitcoin show \u201cBetween Two Asics,\u201d explained that he got his tattoo of the BTC supply formula because \u201cIt\u2019s what proves scarcity.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonetary scarcity is something we\u2019ve been deprived of until Bitcoin, and the fact I can write down what proves there will only ever be a certain amount of Bitcoin is a pretty big deal.\u201d\n\nThe tattoo on his bicep is a common (but unfortunately not strictly accurate) formula for the supply of Bitcoin. He shared a warning with readers: \u201cThe bottom of the Sigma might be the most painful thing I ever experienced. Just a forewarning.\u201d\n\nBut what about OpSec?\n\nHowever, isn\u2019t it risky to advertise one\u2019s love of a digital currency on one\u2019s skin? OpSec, or operational security, is a military term the internet has hijacked. Among the crypto community, it refers to the public sharing of identity or defining features. And a Bitcoin tattoo could put a literal target on one\u2019s back.\n\nErik Dale, whose tattoos are pictured in the above tweet, founded Norway\u2019s \u201cNorthern Lightning\u201d conference series. Dale told Cointelegraph he was aware of the implications. His tattoos are \u201cEquations, no logos or tribal markers, for OpSec reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsiders should realize what they are, but not casual observers.\u201d\n\nRikki, of content creators and investigators Bitcoin Explorers, joked, \u201cWe are not particularly concerned about bad opsec.\u201d He added another Bitcoin tattoo to his collection during a giveaway in Guatemala.\n\nBad OpSec can lead to doxing or the public reveal of people\u2019s personal data. That\u2019s why some Bitcoin advocates mask their online identities, using anonymous profiles on social media. Not so for Rikki and his partner Laura; they have their Bitcoin support on full view.\n\nRikki and Laura\u2019s tattoos. \u201cStack Sats\u201d means save Bitcoin. Source: Rikki.\n\nPiero Coen, the co-founder of Guatemala-based Osmo Wallet, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is a \u201ccounterculture movement, and getting a tattoo related to it is a way to show our commitment to this movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a badge of honor, showing that we are part of this group of \u2018pirates\u2019 who are challenging the traditional financial system and are convinced we\u2019re going to change the world. \u201c\n\nBesides, for Rikki and Laura, much of their lives already permanently exists on camera. Rikki explained:\n\n\u201cWe are Bitcoin content creators, and so we chose to give up our privacy years ago. Besides, there aren\u2019t just the slightly paranoid, scheming, pessimistic, terra plat-prone Bitcoiners \u2014 there are also us, the good-looking, nice, fun, cool and sex-loving Bitcoiners!\u201d\n\nMe: Should I be more low profile?\n\n\n\nStill me: FREE BITCOIN TATTOO!!!!!!!! LET\u2019S MAKE TWO AND MAKE A VLOG ABOUT IT!!!!! pic.twitter.com/HdwnAwRx4Z \u2014 Laura Bitcoin explorers (@Lorinaura) January 30, 2023\n\nLaura put it even more succinctly in a recent tweet:\n\nFor Tatum, another content creator and a recognizable face in the Bitcoin space, \u201cValue is teaching people about Bitcoin and networking through it, so there\u2019s a constant battle with opsec.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the bottom of it, I am comfortable with my own security and what I do and do not share, but \u2018WHY I love Bitcoin\u2019 is always going to be shared.\u201d\n\nTatum walks around Bitcoin conferences wearing a bulletproof vest in a jocular nod to operational security in the Bitcoin space.\n\nTatum interviewing guests in a security vest at Pacific Bitcoin 2022. Source: Tatum\n\nBut what if Bitcoin goes to zero?\n\nUnlike tweets, open letters or company creation, Bitcoin tattoos are tricky to delete. They require commitment.\n\nSo what happens if the currency goes to zero, like many other failed projects from Terra to Celsius? Tatum explained, well, \u201csucks for me!\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I got it, I jokingly said, \u2018Now I really hope it doesn\u2019t go to zero or I\u2019ll look like an idiot.\u2019 But in reality, my tattoo is kind of why it never will go to zero. If one person finds value in Bitcoin, there\u2019s only ever going to be so many. So they will have value.\u201d\n\nBillionaire Mike Novogratz\u2019s tattoo of the failed Terra (LUNA) token is an eternal reminder of the headiness and hedonism accompanying crypto bull runs. The tattoo remains on Novogratz\u2019s arm, while LUNA is worth next to nothing, and its creator, Do Kwon, might be facing jail time. Fortunately, Novogratz says he learned from the experience saying investing \u201crequires humility.\u201c\n\nDale explained he\u2019s prepared to live with the tattoos on his wrists even if Bitcoin does fail. He\u2019s committed until the very end: \u201cIf I\u2019m wrong about this, I want to carry that reminder every day. And if not, I can\u2019t imagine a prouder badge to wear for the rest of my days.\u201d\n\nRelated: Novogratz says LUNA tattoo is a constant reminder investing \u2018requires humility\u2019\n\nFor Taihuttu, it\u2019s important to zoom out and focus on the bigger picture. Bitcoin is a long-term play:\n\n\u201cI believe that people who have tattoos from dollar signs or other fiat have a bigger chance of going to 0.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right; famous rappers and celebrities, including singer Kesha and actor Lena Dunham, have been inked with dollar sign tattoos. It\u2019s unlikely that they were asked if the dollar would go to zero prior to sitting in the tattoo artist\u2019s chair.\n\nKesha\u2019s dollar sign tattoo. Source: popstartats.com\n\nOn a sober note, Taihuttu explained that regardless of the Bitcoin movement underway, the large tattoo on his forearm represents \u201can amazing 10 years of my and my family\u2019s life since 2013, the year that I started mining Bitcoin.\u201d And that\u2019s more than enough reason to get Bitcoin ink."

        "content": "South Korean prosecutors have identified 414.5 billion won ($314.2 million) in illicit assets associated with Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon and his associates. Out of the identified illegal assets, prosecutors have linked about 91.4 billion won ($69 million) of the specified amount directly to Kwon.\n\nAlthough Kwon amassed millions, none of the assets tied to him are recoverable or under the jurisdiction of the South Korean authorities. This is mainly because the now-arrested former CEO reportedly converted most of the illicit funds into Bitcoin (BTC) using overseas crypto exchanges instead of investing in physical assets, per a report published by local media outlet KBS.\n\nEarly investigation into the Terra collapse by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that Kwon siphoned nearly $100 million worth of Bitcoin from Terra post-collapse. In another report based on an SEC interview with former Terraform Labs, published in South Korean media, Kwon was accused of siphoning $80 million a month before the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.\n\nThe South Korean authorities have requested Binance to halt any withdrawal request associated with Kwon. Binance confirmed to Cointelegraph that they are cooperating with the prosecutors and offering any assistance they need.\n\n\u201cWe provided Korean LE authorities with the requested assistance. Since we cannot comment on ongoing LE investigations, for any further comment please reach out to the prosecutors.\u201c\n\nSouth Korean prosecutors are actively tracing properties associated with Terraform Labs executives to recover some illicit funds from the Terra debacle. On April 3, prosecutors seized homes and other assets to stop former Terra employees from selling things that might be tied to legal cases.\n\nIn addition to the residences in Seoul owned by former CEO Shin Hyun-seong and others, the prosecutors also filed foreclosure actions against their foreign-registered vehicles, lands in Hwaseong and Gapyeong in Gyeonggi-do, and Taean in South Chungcheong Province.\n\nRelated: Do Kwon faces fraud charges from US prosecutors hours after arrest\n\nTerra was a booming crypto ecosystem until its $40 billion collapse in May 2022.\n\nWhat was initially thought to be a market-triggered event turned out to be a clear case of fraud, with former CEO Kwon at the epicenter. According to on-chain data, In the 3 weeks leading up to the depeg of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin, one entity dumped over $450 million of UST on the open market. Four days after the last sale, UST started collapsing. The entity behind the massive dump was none other than Terraform Labs.\n\nTFL has been perpetrating the narrative that UST was \"attacked\". This is a false flag. In reality, TFL themselves weakened the Curve pool by irresponsibly dumping a massive amount of UST in a short timeframe. This reduced liquidity and severely weakened the peg. \u2014 FatMan (@FatManTerra) December 6, 2022\n\nDespite an arrest warrant from South Korean authorities and an Interpol red notice against his name, Kwon continued to evade arrest for nearly a year before getting caught on March 23 in Montenegro."

He has repeatedly said that Bitcoin spin-offs derived from the cryptocurrency are in breach of his intellectual property rights because he came up with the original blockchain.\n\nAnd today, he appeared to be making the point that Apple was sharing his alleged seminal work without asking for permission first.\n\nBut Wright has also long been criticized for making such a claim and not having the proof to back it up: To do so, he\u2019d have to show that he has the private keys to Satoshi\u2019s Bitcoin address.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWright\u2019s lawyers told Decrypt in 2020 that he didn\u2019t have them.\n\nDecrypt today asked Wright whether he would try and sue Apple for breach of copyright but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nIn February, Wright lost a claim in a UK court to protect the Bitcoin blockchain by copyright. He also hinted in December that he was no longer interested in convincing people that he created the world\u2019s biggest digital asset.\n\nWright is also supports Bitcoin SV: a Bitcoin spin-off that emerged in November 2018 when Bitcoin Cash\u2014another fork and currently the 30th biggest cryptocurrency\u2014split in two.\n\nBitcoin SV proponents (Wright is perhaps the loudest cheerleader) call Bitcoin SV \u201cthe original Bitcoin\u201d but it been delisted from a number of major exchanges.\n\nWright is no stranger to the courts: Reuters reports that he is currently in the process of suing 15 Bitcoin developers to retrieve around 111,000 BTC after he lost the encrypted keys to access them when his home computer network was allegedly hacked."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nBitcoin white paper is apparently hiding in Apple\u2019s modern macOS\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original white paper laying out the thesis for the Bitcoin network is seemingly hiding within every modern version of the operating system for Apple\u2019s Mac computers. An April 5 blog post from technologist Andy Baio revealed that a PDF of the Bitcoin white paper has \u201capparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.\u201d Baio told Cointelegraph he was trying to fix his printer and scan a document when Nakamoto\u2019s white paper first appeared. He created a prompt in Terminal that enables others to easily access the white paper.\n\nBinance Australia Derivatives license canceled by securities regulator\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission has canceled the license of Binance Australia Derivatives after a targeted review of its operations in the country. The company\u2019s clients will not be able to increase derivatives positions or open new positions with the platform from April 14, and existing derivatives positions must be closed before April 21. The Australian securities regulator also revealed that it has been conducting a targeted review of Binance\u2019s financial services business in Australia, including its classification of retail and wholesale clients. Spot trading on Binance is still available for Australian residents.\n\nFTX philanthropic donations have created a complex dilemma for recipients\n\nFTX philanthropic arm had pledged $1 billion in donations toward research academics across prestigious universities. Its team, however, resigned after FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. Now, many scholars and researchers who were early recipients of the grant are now stuck in limbo over payment of further grants for their programs, while many studying on the FTX grant were forced to drop out of their courses due to the fear of repayment. FTX Future Fund\u2019s grants were focused on research projects for the safe development of artificial intelligence, reducing catastrophic bio-risk, improving institutions, economic growth, great power relations and effective altruism, among many others.\n\nElon Musk changes Twitter icon to Doge after seeking lawsuit dismissal\n\nTwitter\u2019s traditional bird mascot was replaced on April 3 with an image of a Shiba Inu, the icon of the popular meme token Dogecoin. The update came two days after the social media platform\u2019s CEO Elon Musk asked a United States judge to dismiss a $258 billion lawsuit filed by investors alleging the operation of a pyramid scheme to promote Dogecoin. Musk\u2019s lawyers, however, argue that \u201cfunny pictures\u201d and \u201ctweeting words of support\u201d do not amount to a fraud claim. As for this week, the marketing move positively impacted the altcoin\u2019s price, with the DOGE token surging by over 22% one hour after the icon was changed.\n\nUS Bitcoin reaches tentative settlement to reopen Niagara Falls mining facility\n\nCrypto miner US Bitcoin Corp has come to a tentative agreement with the City of Niagara Falls that will allow it to reopen its local mining operation, according to media reports. A state supreme court judge ordered its plant closed in early March. The settlement still requires the approval of the city council. Under the potential agreement, the company will have to pay $150,000 in fees to the city and $180,000 to reimburse legal costs and new application fees, alongside a $1 million fine. US Bitcoin Corp must also implement measures to reduce noise at the plant, including building a noise-dampening wall and submitting to third-party monitoring.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $27,928, Ether (ETH) at $1,857 and XRP at $0.51.

        "title": "How to Find the Hidden Bitcoin Whitepaper in macOS - The Mac Observer",
        "content": "There are often Easter eggs found within Apple\u2019s various operating systems. In the latest find, sleuths discovered a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin whitepaper hidden within macOS for years. In fact, it\u2019s shipped with every copy of the Mac operating system since macOS Mojave in 2018. Let\u2019s walk through how you can find this hidden gem.\n\nWhich Versions of macOS Have the Bitcoin Whitepaper?\n\nAccording to Andy Baio, Nakamoto\u2019s technical paper on the first cryptocurrency has been included in every version of macOS since 10.14 Mojave. You won\u2019t find it, though, in macOS 10.13 High Sierra or earlier.\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed for myself that it\u2019s present on macOS Ventura 13.3. Someone at Apple squirreled it away inside an Image Capture device called \u201cVirtual Scanner II.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rather perplexing, because that device doesn\u2019t seem to appear for everyone in the Image Capture utility. For those who do have it, though, the Bitcoin whitepaper serves as a sample document for the device. Some suggest Virtual Scanner II might be used to power the \u201cImport from iPhone\u201d feature, but I\u2019ve been unable to confirm that.\n\nFinding the Hidden PDF On Your Mac\n\nThat being said, here are two ways you can locate the hidden PDF. You can do this either from Terminal or Finder, with Terminal being (surprisingly) the easiest method.\n\nOpening the Bitcoin Whitepaper Using Terminal\n\nThe quickest and easiest way to view this whitepaper is going to be from the command line. Here\u2019s what you need to do.\n\nOpen Applications > Utilities > Terminal. From Terminal, enter the following command all on a single line:\n\nopen /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf\n\nThe Bitcoin PDF should open immediately in Preview.\n\nNavigating to the Easter Egg With Finder\n\nIf Terminal\u2019s not inside your comfort zone, fear not. There is another way to open up Satoshi\u2019s Bitcoin treatise.\n\nTime needed: 1 minute To open the Bitcoin whitepaper using Finder, just follow these steps. Click the Finder icon in the Dock. Click on Macintosh HD. Open System > Library > Image Capture > Devices. Right-click on VirtualScanner.app, then click Show Package Contents. Now open Contents > Resources. Double-click the simpledoc.pdf file.\n\nHere Today, Gone Tomorrow?\n\nIf you want to snag that PDF copy, you may want to follow one of the guides above sooner rather than later. According to our sources, someone at Apple filed the document\u2019s presence as an issue/bug nearly a year ago.\n\nWhile the person who reported the \u201cbug\u201d hasn\u2019t taken any action or commented on it since then, other sources say the file will \u201clikely be removed in future versions.\u201d\n\nPersonally, I think Apple should leave it, as it\u2019s completely harmless. It\u2019s definitely not the problem posed by an earlier Image Capture bug that could fill your entire storage device with empty data."

        "content": "Billionaire crypto investor Michael Novogratz says that once the Federal Reserve takes a pause, Bitcoin could start to take off again.\n\nNovogratz, who leads Galaxy Digital Holdings, predicted the central bank under the helm of Jerome Powell will remain \u201cvery hawkish for a while\u201d due to high inflation, and will likely raise interest rates by 50 basis points soon. But as the economy slows down and the Fed steps back, \u201cBitcoin goes to the moon,\u201d he said, repeating a popular crypto catchphrase.\n\nNovogratz was speaking at the \u201cBitcoin 2022\u201d conference in Miami, which kicked off on Wednesday with the unveiling of a bull statue that commemorates the city's partiality toward cryptocurrencies and the digital-assets industry. The event has attracted more than 25,000 attendees.\n\nNovogratz also reiterated a call that Bitcoin will eventually reach a price of $500,000 and eventually $1 million. The largest digital currency fell about 3.3% to $44,366 as of 10:34 a.m. Eastern time.\n\n\u201cI go to bed and I pray that the stewards of the U.S. economy don't screw it up,\u201d he said, adding that he has Russian friends who have gone \u201cbankrupt\u201d recently. \u201cAnd so I really do pray that the dollar is going to be strong and it doesn't go to infinity because Bitcoin going to infinity means the rest of the Western world has really fallen apart,\u201d he said, though Bitcoin can reach his price targets \u201cwith stability in the West.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has recently traded in a narrow range -- it hasn't been able to meaningfully break out above $48,000 and is down so far this year. Proponents have been debating which of its narratives -- including whether it's an inflation hedge or not -- is most prevalent at the moment and which story could likely end up sticking for the long run.\n\nNovogratz said that though Bitcoin has largely traded in tandem with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, it could be in the process of disabusing itself from that relationship. Bitcoin's purpose, he says, won't be for purchasing everyday items, like shoes. But, \u201cit's that I'm going to take some of my wealth and preserve and store it there.\u201d The coin, he added, is becoming a part of institutional portfolios."

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High For The 4th Time In 2023: Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining difficulty continues to break records despite the struggles of BTC to surpass the $30,000 resistance mark. The leading coin has attracted the interest of miners in recent months due to the price recovery experienced since the turn of the year.\n\nBitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits New Record\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty moved to an all-time high on April 6, 2023, following the most recent mining difficulty adjustment on its blockchain network. The mining difficulty rose for the fourth consecutive time and reached 47.8 trillion, an increase of 2.3%.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining difficulty automatically adjusts every 2,016 blocks \u2013 approximately two weeks \u2013 to maintain the 10-minute block creation time. There has been a steady increase in mining difficulty in recent weeks, with the last downward trend recorded on February 11.\n\nOne of the consequences is reflected in the hash price, which is the rate of profit miners make for the hashrate they provide to the Bitcoin network. In theory, a higher mining difficulty leads to a lower hash price. This is because more miners are contributing computing power than normal, leading to more competition for the rewards that the Bitcoin network provides miners that produce new blocks on the network.\n\nRelated Reading: Buckle Up! Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Signal An Impending Rollercoaster Ride\n\nFurthermore, the Bitcoin hashrate or processing power can indicate the degree of mining difficulty. At the time of the mining difficulty adjustment that preceded the latest one, BTC\u2019s hash rate was at a record high leading to increased mining difficulty.\n\nHowever, this has changed recently, with the hashrate falling by an average of 20 EH/s this week. It should be noted that Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate varies as measured by different sources. For example, BTC.com places the metric at 338 EH/s, and mempool places this at a slightly higher metric of 347/ EH/s\n\nBullish Market A Major Reason For Increased Mining Difficulty\n\nBitcoin has appreciated by more than 50% since the start of 2023, leading to calls for a bullish market. Unsurprisingly this positive trend has led to many miners reconnecting their equipment after a difficult 2022.\n\nRelated Reading: Uniswap Who? Trader Joe\u2019s AMM Takes DeFi By Storm\n\nThe collapse of Terra Luna and subsequent fallout from FTX led to significant bearish pressure on the market, with several coins taking steep price declines. Bitcoin was one of the coins to dip, leading to a difficult year for miners, with many having to sell their equipment or shut down operations to stay afloat.\n\nHowever, the bull run of 2023 has raised expectations from miners that the market could be on its way to previous levels. Nonetheless, the crypto mining sector has not been without its difficulties, with friendly places like Texas in the United States planning to tighten regulations on electricity that could affect the booming sector soon.\n\nFeatured image from unsplash, charts from mempool and Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Ever notice that macOS takes up a whole lot of storage space? There\u2019s a lot of code in macOS, and apparently, some of it is not what you\u2019d expect, as Andy Baio found out earlier this week. On Baio\u2019s blog, Waxy.com, he wrote about his discovery of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin whitepaper that is stashed within macOS.\n\nThe paper, titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\u201d explains the Bitcoin electronic cash system and was originally published in 2008. The paper has apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018. Why? No one really knows. Baio theorizes that it was used as a test document.\n\nBaio notes that \u201ca little bird\u201d told him that the paper could be removed in a future version of macOS. So if you want to see it, here\u2019s how.\n\nSee the hidden Bitcoin whitepaper via the Terminal\n\nOpen the Terminal app (it\u2019s in Applications > Utilities) and enter the following:\n\nopen /System/Library/Image\\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf\n\nSee the hidden Bitcoin whitepaper via the Finder\n\nDon\u2019t want to use the Terminal? Do the following:\n\nIn the Finder, open the Go menu and select Go to Folder. In the Go to Folder that appears enter the following: /System/Library/Image Capture/Devices Press the Return key. The Finder window should appear with a VirtualScanner app icon. Control-click (or right click) VirtualScanner and select Show Package Contents. The Finder window should show a Contents folder.

        "content": "Bitcoin Q2 Fundamental Outlook\n\nBitcoin prices enjoyed a 60% rally in the first quarter, allowing the largest cryptocurrency to recover a fair portion of last year\u2019s losses. As fears of financial instability continue to drive risk sentiment, Bitcoin prices have surged and could continue to be driven by the same systemic risks in the second quarter.\n\nIn Q2 of 2023, the main factors to watch are:\n\nRecession fears (rising risks of a recession could be a major headwind for speculative assets if the banking sector regains confidence).\n\n(rising risks of a recession could be a major headwind for speculative assets if the banking sector regains confidence). Inflation and monetary policy (ECB and the Federal Reserve have reiterated their intention to raise rates in inflation remains elevated).\n\n(ECB and the Federal Reserve have reiterated their intention to raise rates in inflation remains elevated). Financial regulations imposed on digital currency and a potential Lawsuit between the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) and Coinbase (one of the largest crypto exchanges). Depending on the developments and the outcome, this could be another risk factor to monitor closely.\n\nWill Systemic Risks Make or Break Bitcoin?\n\nAfter a strong start to 2023, prices rallied nearly 40%, before settling at a key level of technical resistance around the September 2022 high of $22,781. As Fed expectations continued to drive sentiment, a robust labor market and persistently high levels of inflation opened the door for the Federal Reserve to consider raising rates more aggressively.\n\nStocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, to a certain extent, do not earn interest, so a high-interest rate environment does not bode well for these non-yielding assets. After a series of aggressive rate hikes throughout 2022, markets had expected the pace of monetary policy tightening to ease. However, as the Fed and the ECB remained fixated on fulfilling the objectives of the dual mandate (to achieve full employment and price stability), inflation remained well above the 2% target. This caused both major central banks to consider hiking rates more aggressively to tame price pressures.\n\nSource: Refinitiv\n\nWill Contagion from the Banking Crisis Continue to Support Digital Assets?\n\nHowever, following the collapse of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank), Signature Bank, and the ongoing problems at First Republic Bank, pressure mounted on the Fed to consider pausing its rate cycle.\n\nAlthough the financial sector remains vulnerable to contagion that could result in an increase in the number of bank failures, the probability of additional rate hikes has been reduced. Instead, many expect the Fed to announce rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nSource: Refinitiv\n\nAs a result, the combination of the eroding credibility of the banking sector, a weaker US Dollar, and a potential Fed pivot has boosted the appeal of digital assets. As Bitcoin and its major counterparts continue to monitor the geopolitical backdrop, fundamentals will likely remain as the primary catalyst for price action. With prices currently trading at their highest level since June last year, both technical and fundamentals could assist in driving the prominent trend."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty, the amount of effort and time needed to find a proper hash for each blockchain block, continues to increase as of April 7 2023.\n\nThe latest #Bitcoin block difficulty adjustment pushes the difficulty metric to 47.89 trillion \u2013 another record high. As a result, it's harder than ever to mine a Bitcoin block. pic.twitter.com/rAVb9SdUgI \u2014 BitKE (@BitcoinKE) April 8, 2023\n\nThe mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted automatically approximately every two weeks in response to changes in the hashrate of the network. This adjustment is necessary to maintain a block processing time of approximately 10 minutes and prevent the network from either slowing down or speeding up over time.\n\nThe latest rise in Bitcoin mining difficulty marks the fourth consecutive increase, with the previous three increases being 9.95%, 1.16%, and 7.56% as highlighted on btc.com. These increases indicate that the network has been responding to the gradual growth of the hashrate.\n\nThe most recent adjustment to the block difficulty has pushed the difficulty metric to a new all-time high of 47.89 trillion, making it more challenging than ever to mine a block and obtain a bitcoin. The next difficulty adjustment is expected to occur in about 12 days.\n\nThe average computation power, or hashrate, of the entire Bitcoin network has also reached an all-time high of 342.16 EH/s. Meanwhile, the average block verification and production time, known as block times, remains below ten minutes.\n\nAt the same time, while bitcoin\u2019s network difficulty and hash rate increased, making the network more expensive to mine, so has miner revenue increased. Miners receive bitcoins, the native currency of the blockchain, as a reward for validating blocks and processing transactions. The revenue earned by miners takes into account both inflation rewards, known as block subsidies, and transaction fees.\n\nWhile most miner revenue comes from the block subsidy \u2013 6.25 BTC per block right now \u2013 which is a constant in BTC terms, transaction fees are also a way for miners to generate revenue.\n\nIn March 2023, bitcoin miners earned almost $732 million from block subsidies, which is their primary source of revenue. When transaction fees are added to this figure, their total earnings amounted to $755 million. Despite this increase, their profitability still falls significantly below the all-time highs.\n\nThe rise in revenue for bitcoin miners is closely linked to the value of the cryptocurrency they are mining. Since the beginning of the year, the price of bitcoin has surged by 69%, and in the past month alone, it has risen by nearly 26%. This increase in value has more than offset the higher costs associated with mining resulting in higher profitability for miners.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________"

        "content": "Paris is positioning itself as the next major hub for the cryptocurrency industry, despite the closure of several crypto-friendly banks and the failure of FTX. The French government is showing support for the crypto industry and blockchain technology, with President Emmanuel Macron seeing cryptocurrency as a way to attract businesses to the region. This has significant implications for major crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as newer tokens such as Signuptoken.com.\n\nSignuptoken.com: A Revolutionary Crypto Project\n\nSignuptoken.com is a new crypto project with a unique concept. Its goal is to create generational wealth by registering a single email that will help subscribers retire early. The project aims to accumulate one million email subscribers before launching its token on Uniswap. Currently, Signuptoken.com has already accumulated 3,000 email subscribers, bringing it one step closer to its target.\n\nSubscribers will receive regular email updates on the project\u2019s progress. Once the one-million email subscription goal is reached, the team will send out a single email announcing the launch of the ERC-20 token. The project is attempting something that has not been achieved on a global scale before.\n\nTo ensure the validity of the project\u2019s one million email subscription goal, the team will send out a verification email to confirm that all users added are genuine. The team has not revealed their identities and will not be providing tokenomics about the crypto coin.\n\nBitcoin: A Strong Investment Choice\n\nBitcoin is currently the largest cryptocurrency on the market, and more and more establishments are starting to accept it as a payment method. In Paris, Burger King has introduced power bank rental machines called Instpower, which accept crypto payments such as BTC. These machines are connected to Binance Pay and Alchemy Pay.\n\nThis move by Burger King in Paris is part of a larger trend of companies embracing cryptocurrency payments, highlighting the growing acceptance and legitimacy of digital currencies. With the rise of crypto and the growing demand for alternative payment methods, more businesses will likely start accepting cryptocurrency payments in the near future.\n\nEthereum Holders Await Price Rally\n\nMany Ethereum holders are eagerly anticipating a price rally, as suggested by crypto analyst Justin Bennett. Bennett speculates that Ethereum may face a rally that could liquidate traders facing bearish action on ETH\u2019s platform. The rally at the end of March could hint at the crypto market\u2019s short-term performance.\n\nWhile the crypto market is typically affected by stock market trends, there is often a lag between the two asset classes. If the crypto market takes cues from equities, a resistance level at $1,840 for Ethereum is possible. Therefore, a short squeeze could occur, triggering rallies, as there is a considerable amount of short liquidations over the $2,000 price level.\n\nEmbracing the Future of Finance with Crypto Coins\n\nAs Paris embraces cryptocurrency and recognizes its benefits and potential as an alternative to traditional forms of currency, it may inspire other countries to follow suit. While crypto investments do carry risks due to economic conditions and market volatility, accepting crypto as part of the future of finance can help everyone adapt to the changing landscape of the digital economy.\n\nSignuptoken.com could become the next major crypto coin to launch on an exchange. Learn more about this unique crypto project and sign up to reap the early benefits when the coin launches.\n\nVisit Signuptoken.com today:\n\nWebsite: https://www.signuptoken.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SignUpToken_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/SignUpToken\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The year 2022 was a successful one for crypto casinos. Mobile gaming had a sharp rise, general improvements, and the introduction of new cryptocurrencies as payment options.\n\nThe hold and win slots have taken the gaming industry by storm. Additionally, once 2023 begins, you can only anticipate seeing more innovation given the popularity and profitability of cryptocurrency casinos.\n\nThe cryptocurrency gaming sector, albeit young, has already altered the way we view casinos. Today, you may use cryptocurrencies to place bets and improve your investment portfolio while still protecting your privacy and personal information. However, the cryptocurrency gaming industry is always changing, so in 2023 you may expect some fascinating developments to emerge.\n\nSome of the major trends to expect in the bitcoin casino gaming industry in 2023 include:\n\nChanges in crypto payment\n\nEvery casino\u2019s payment method will undergo significant modifications in 2023. Some bitcoin casinos have started bypassing exchanges. On their website, they provide you the option to buy cryptocurrencies directly from them.\n\nThis greatly simplifies the procedure of making deposits at casinos. Additionally, it increases the accessibility of crypto casinos for a much bigger player base.\n\nYou may make a purchase using the program and your debit/credit card or Google Pay. Your casino account receives your money right away. In 2023, we can anticipate finding this function at any crypto casino.\n\nThe advent of original games with provable fairness\n\nProvably fair games are the obsession of cryptocurrency gamers. You may utilize blockchain technology to check the fairness of these games. Bitcoin casinos have gone the extra mile to provide players with more of a good thing by developing their own due to their popularity with players.\n\nAuthentic crash games, Plinko, dice games, and more are available. And throughout 2023, you can anticipate not just seeing this tendency persist but also growing.\n\nMany renowned bitcoin casinos have employed a group of game developers to produce brand-new, original games. There are no other casinos that offer these games. There are many other provably fair games available, including online slots, roulette, poker, and more.\n\nCreation of mobile-compatible casino games\n\nToday\u2019s mobile-first revolution has been fueled by the release of new features, the widespread use of smartphones, and the increased accessibility of high-speed internet.\n\nIn most international markets, 80% of all gamblers in the gaming sector utilize mobile devices. According to recent estimates, internet devices now provide 70% of the income for the online betting sector.\n\nThis trend will undoubtedly impact the business over the coming several years by encouraging the development of casino games and activities that can be played on mobile and wearable devices.\n\nImproved online safety capabilities\n\nYou already experience higher levels of online safety when you play at cryptocurrency casinos rather than conventional betting sites. You can protect your financial and personal data by making deposits and withdrawals using your cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nHowever, there are undoubtedly some frauds in the field of online betting. To shield people from the consequences of malware and phishing attempts, the industry is swiftly adjusting. Even more crucially, the most trustworthy Bitcoin betting sites make use of top-notch software infrastructure and get the required certifications to increase consumer confidence.\n\nVR and AR gaming\n\nTechnologies like virtual reality and augmented reality have significantly contributed to the growth of the digital entertainment sector as a whole. And the cryptocurrency gaming market is by no means an exception.\n\nThese technological advancements enable you to have a lot more immersive gaming experience. You can imitate the special feelings you would have while playing at your preferred physical casino.\n\nAt the moment, the price of VR and AR headsets as well as their size continue to be a major barrier to their widespread acceptance. But as these technologies advance, more and more gamers opt to participate in VR gambling sessions in 2023 and beyond.\n\nCreation of robust bitcoin casino communities\n\nWith its players, crypto casinos are setting the groundwork for a better feeling of community. This was accomplished in the past through ongoing advertising offers and internet forums.\n\nBut it seems like casinos are trying to promote a feeling of family among their patrons. As a consequence, we are beginning to notice more public community conversations where you may interact with others, pose questions, win prizes by providing the answers to trivia questions, and give one another advice.\n\nThis kind of interaction has previously been seen in multiplayer games, such as the group conversations found in real-money casino games. However, we are now observing it more clearly at bitcoin casinos. If you\u2019re new to casinos and looking for assistance or advice on how to enhance your games, this can be extremely beneficial.\n\nA more immersive casino experience\n\nThe crypto online casino industry has lagged behind other segments of the digital entertainment market in terms of gameplay and visuals. However, it\u2019s unlikely that this tendency will continue for very long.\n\nToday\u2019s bitcoin casinos use a variety of elements to make the gameplay more interesting. The casinos also want to improve the visual attractiveness of their gaming tables and slot machines. Utilizing specialized programming languages and graphic design methods are a couple of these.\n\nNot all cryptocurrency casinos are made equal or have the same features. However, advancements in visuals and user experience across the board can help you make an informed decision and personalize your gaming experience.\n\nAn emphasis on online privacy\n\nThe amount of secrecy offered by crypto casinos is one of the key factors that encourage gamblers to utilize them. You may protect your online privacy and participate in anonymous games without having to provide any money or personal information.\n\nThe industry is anticipated to continue developing in this manner during the next years to enhance consumer safety and privacy. New features that will soon be introduced include registration-free gaming and increased degrees of adherence to national privacy laws like GDPR.\n\nLive player option\n\nBuilding a thriving gaming community goes hand in hand with this latest iteration of bitcoin casino promos. Numerous bitcoin casinos are now scanning your data and analyzing your playing behavior using AI software.\n\nThis enables the promotions department of the casino to create a more accurate player profile for each user. The information will also allow the casino to build customized casino offers for you based on the games you prefer playing.\n\nA bitcoin casino may discover, for instance, that you play Aviator frequently and at around the same time each month. If the casino notices that tendency, it may send you an email or a direct message and give you free spins for your favorite game.\n\nAdditionally, casinos have the option to do this in real-time to improve benefits for VIP players. To provide you with more personalized VIP perks, they connect you with the VIP manager. The relationship between you and the casino will be strengthened thanks to these methods and technologies. They genuinely provide you with a singular experience that you can\u2019t get anyplace else.\n\nEsports gambling\n\nOver the past ten years, there have been significant changes in the esports betting industry. Some of the finest gambling platforms have recently integrated eSports gaming into their libraries as a result of recent developments in the bitcoin casino market.\n\nEven though players haven\u2019t been drawn to eSports at bitcoin casinos, the top casinos are always working to include additional eSports elements into their platforms. Therefore, it is projected that eSports gambling would become popular at online casinos in 2023.\n\nOther potential gambling trends for 2023\n\nSome of the crypto gambling trends that you may or may not experience in 2023 include:\n\nGamification\n\nIf you play video games or know someone who does, you\u2019ve seen some popular patterns emerge. Now, you may buy skins, specialized skills and weapons, and other items straight from within the game. This is an additional area where bitcoin casinos may start to see how they may improve the gaming experience.\n\nCasinos may start to offer avatar creation and customization tools so that users may create unique avatars for their user accounts. We can undoubtedly anticipate that this strategy, which has been quite effective in mobile gaming, will soon spread into iGaming.\n\nCasinos are also introducing Wheels of Fortune loyalty programs as another kind of gamification. You may spin the wheel and win quick cryptocurrency rewards at several casinos\u2019 daily free spins events.\n\nTop crypto casinos are also quite popular with level-up systems, where you get fresh incentives for each level you advance to. Increased cashback payouts, free spins on well-known games, fast cash awards, and other incentives can be prizes.\n\nTokens\n\nNumerous cryptocurrency casinos have started awarding players with custom tokens. Casino tokens may be exchanged for items like free spins, cash, and other things. Similar to how cryptocurrency prices vary, the value of these assets will be as well.\n\nWhether gamers will desire or utilize them is the key question in this. It all down to how it is done. These assets should be special and accomplish something that eventually improves the overall user experience since you don\u2019t want to give away pointless rewards. Although many casinos have started token and NFT marketplaces, they are still relatively comparable to most VIP loyalty programs.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The victim, who earlier worked with a share trading firm, lodged an FIR with the LT Marg police on April 5.The complainant had recently quit her job and was at home. She came across an advertisement on Telegram about the Bitcoin money doubling investment scheme.She had seen such messages earlier too, but this time, she opened a link given in the message link and found a mobile number in it. The woman called on the number and the call receiver said he was from a Bitcoin company and explained the investment scheme to the woman, convincing her to invest in it saying her investment will be doubled in 45 minutes. The fraudster collected the complainant's bank account details where he said they would be sending her profit.\"The complainant initially invested Rs 7,000. She was told that it will be doubled within 45 minutes. However, even after two to three hours when the profit was not deposited to her account, she contacted the person and asked him about it. The accused told her that she had gained double profit and asked her to pay income tax fees, GST, legal fees etc,\" said an officer. The accused told her that by the time she sends the legal fees and other charges, they would have further invested her profit to double it. The accused communicated via WhatsApp messages and calls.Police said between March 14 and March 20, the woman sent Rs 3.88 lakh in eight Indian bank accounts provided by the cyber fraudster through more than a dozen transactions. \"The woman kept asking for her money but the accused would tell her to send more money as fees saying her investment in Bitcoin was increasing. However, after March 20, the accused stopped taking her calls,\" said police. This is when she realised she was duped. A team led by senior PI Jyoti Desai and comprising API Prakash Patil and head constable Santosh Paware is probing the case."

Highest gas prices\n\n2. Worst inflation\n\n3. Plummeting crypto prices\n\n4. Highest rent prices ever\n\n5. Created new incomprehensible language\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this and voted for Biden and you still don\u2019t regret it then you are the American problem. \u2014 Jake Paul (@jakepaul) June 12, 2022\n\nFraud accusations\n\nIt seems that one commenter, in particular, was referring to Paul\u2019s support for the SafeMoon (SAFEMOON), now revamped as SafeMoon V2 (SFM) token, that faced security concerns and several scandals in 2022, including fraud lawsuits against the network\u2019s executives and celebrity influencers who endorsed it and then allegedly sold their holdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Jake Paul has been charged for illegally promoting Tron (TRX) and/or BitTorrent (BTT) without disclosing that he was compensated for it, alongside Lindsay Lohan, DeAndre Cortez Way (Soulja Boy), Austin Mahone, Michele Mason (Kendra Lust), Miles Parks McCollum (Lil Yachty), Shaffer Smith (Ne-Yo), and Aliaune Thiam (Akon).\n\nNotably, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun and three of his companies, Tron Foundation Limited, BitTorrent Foundation Ltd., and Rainberry Inc., also stand accused of the unregistered offer and sale of TRX and BTT as investments through multiple unregistered \u201cbounty programs,\u201d as Finbold reported on May 22."
