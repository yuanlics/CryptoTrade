        "title": "Bitcoin is up 72% in 2023. Is Crypto Winter finally over? - Fortune",
        "content": "A regulatory crackdown, a banking collapse, and persistent inflation seemingly would spell trouble for the health of the crypto industry, but Bitcoin, Ether, and other marquee tokens have skyrocketed since the beginning of 2023.\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is up 72%, recently crossing the $30,000 threshold. (It has since dipped below $28,500, as inflation and rising interest rates have spooked investors.) Ether, the second largest, is up 62%, blowing past $2,000 after a successful upgrade to Ethereum, the token\u2019s blockchain. And the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies is up to about $1.2 trillion, an increase of approximately 50% since the beginning of the year, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhile recent prices for the most prominent digital assets still pale in comparison to their heights in 2021, when the total crypto market cap neared $3 trillion, the price rally has observers questioning whether Crypto Spring has finally sprung.\n\nIs crypto winter over or should I still hang my warm clothes at the door? \ud83d\udcc8 \u2014 Sariraa.eth (@SariraMerikhi) April 14, 2023\n\nBut is Crypto Winter actually over? Fortune spoke to four analysts to place the current rally in historical context.\n\nThe four-year cycle hypothesis\n\n\u201cCrypto has worked like clockwork in four-year cycles,\u201d Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, a crypto investment outfit, told Fortune.\n\nAnd so far, he says, there have been three rounds of peaks and valleys.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, the price of the cryptocurrency rose and then fell in 2014 with the collapse of one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which went bankrupt after hackers made off with hundreds of millions in customer funds.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, crypto prices increased again, plummeting in 2018 when the era of ICOs, or initial coin offerings, left many investors bereft as many of the tokens they feverishly bought turned out to be quick cash grabs.\n\nAnd from 2019 to 2021, prices rose once more, dropping in 2022 after a series of high-profile crypto companies went belly-up, most significantly FTX, the bankrupt exchange once valued at $32 billion.\n\nSome analysts have commonly understood Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations\u2014and the crypto industry\u2019s growth writ large\u2014to roughly correspond to when Bitcoin is \u201chalved,\u201d or when the rewards for mining Bitcoin, the process by which computers secure the digital asset\u2019s blockchain, are reduced by 50%.\n\nThis reduction in Bitcoin rewards, the theory goes, makes the cryptocurrency\u2019s supply scarcer, which thereby increases its price.\n\n\u201cPost-halving, there\u2019s a big rally that happens,\u201d Gautam Chhugani, managing director and senior digital assets analyst at AB Bernstein, told Fortune. \u201cPre-halving, there\u2019s an anticipation rally that happens.\u201d\n\nBitwise\u2019s Hougan, on the other hand, believes that the start of each four-year cycle corresponds to technical innovations. In 2011, mass-market crypto exchanges\u2014Coinbase, Kraken, etc.\u2014launched, allowing laypeople to buy Bitcoin with cash. In 2015, Vitalik Buterin invented Ethereum, which promised to decentralize cloud computing. And in 2019, the \u201cfirst real applications of Ethereum\u201d appeared, Hougan says, including DeFi, or decentralized finance, stablecoins, and NFTs, or non-fungible tokens.\n\nThe four-year cycle hypothesis uses a sample size of three instances of price gains and falls, a small dataset. However, if the trend holds, crypto is due for another bull run.\n\nBullish on Bitcoin\u2014and crypto\n\nIn the near term, Chhugani of AB Bernstein believes Bitcoin and the crypto industry will follow the peaks and valleys of the larger world economy. However, he\u2019s optimistic on its medium and long-term outlook. \u201cBitcoin has never had two negative years consequently,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nAnalysts at Bitfinex Alpha, a market research team within the crypto exchange Bitfinex, agree. \u201cWhile the jury is still out as to whether the Crypto Winter is finally over, Bitcoin network activity is indicating a healthy uptrend in transaction fees,\u201d they said in a statement to Fortune.\n\nAnd Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, thinks it\u2019s arguable that the industry is even in a bear market at all. \u201cIt depends on what your definition of Crypto Winter is,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing by price and sentiment, or how the public views crypto, the chill of winter is obvious. However, going by other metrics, it\u2019s comparatively balmy.\n\nRudick cited a 40% increase in crypto users in 2022, according to Crypto.com, a 5% increase in the number of developers in 2022, according to Electric Capital, and a 293% increase in smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, or programs running on the blockchain, according to Alchemy.\n\nDespite the optimism, Chhugani, the analyst at AB Bernstein, warned that the feverish pace that saw Bitcoin\u2019s price rise to almost $70,000 in 2021 isn\u2019t directly around the corner. \u201cRegulation remains challenging,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cSo we\u2019re not in the middle of a crazy raging bull market.\u201d\n\nThat said, he remains bullish. \u201c\u200bThis industry has died like a few hundred times in the last 14 years,\u201d he said. However, despite constant predictions of crypto\u2019s collapse, he added, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really happen.\u201d"

        "title": "Violation at a Pennsylvania drilling site raises questions about lack of Bitcoin regulation - alleghenyfront.org",
        "content": "This story comes from our partners at WPSU\n\nA gas and oil company mining for cryptocurrency in Elk County, Pennsylvania, was found to be in violation of state regulations when it installed equipment before getting approval from the state Department of Environmental Protection, but the company says it is following the rules.\n\nA March 1 DEP inspection at Diversified Gas and Oil\u2019s Jay Township site found the company had put in place tools for cryptocurrency operations. The company does have a General Permit. But, according to the DEP, Diversified did not have a permit to install the air pollution sources used to generate power for crypto mining. That specific permit is currently under review.\n\nA DEP spokesman said the violation might result in an enforcement action.\n\nThe inspection report notes equipment that was at the Longhorn C pad site, including four natural gas microturbines to make electricity along with two trailers with equipment for cryptocurrency. An engine, generator and oil tank were also there, but were not in operation. The DEP spokesman said the department could not confirm if the cryptocurrency equipment was installed and operating before March 1.\n\nDiversified, headquartered in Alabama, is reportedly the biggest oil and gas well owner in the country. A statement from a company spokesman said Diversified is complying with state rules.\n\n\u201cWe believe operations at the Longhorn C pad are permitted and also operating through exemptions with the Department of Environmental Protection, and that we are in compliance with the requirements,\u201d the statement says.\n\nRead More\n\nEnvironmental groups oppose plan\n\nCrypto mining has been growing in Pennsylvania, raising questions about oversight.\n\nJay Township supervisors had written to DEP earlier this year, saying they were getting complaints about the noise coming from the site. Residents near other crypto mining sites in Pennsylvania have made similar complaints. When reached for comment, a supervisor said the company had addressed the township\u2019s concerns and the site was quieter now.\n\nThree environmental organizations, PennFuture, Clean Air Council and Earthjustice, submitted comments asking the DEP to deny or withdraw approval of Diversified\u2019s plan. Their letter points to the company\u2019s previous violations in Pennsylvania \u2014 operating without valid authorization at 19 locations \u2014 that are listed in a DEP filing.\n\nRob Altenburg, director of the PennFuture Energy Center, said the bitcoin mining industry is not highly regulated.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re seeing a whole lot of violations at a company, it certainly does raise questions: Are they prioritizing public health and environmental protection in their operations,\u201d Altenburg said.\n\nBitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency, currently has a price of about $30,000. Bitcoin mining uses computer systems to solve complex problems, in an effort to do it more quickly than other miners and get rewarded with a coin. But, those supercomputers use a lot of energy.\n\n\u201cAcross the whole Bitcoin network, it uses about as much energy as the state of New York \u2014 more than many entire countries,\u201d Altenburg said.\n\nAltenburg said he and others are trying to raise awareness at the state and federal levels.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this problem here, and it\u2019s bad now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s pollution happening now, but it has the potential to get worse.\u201d"

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?\n\nClean electricity, the backbone of the Biden administration\u2019s strategy for slashing carbon emissions, is becoming daunting to expand.\n\nUS wind farms, which last year generated more electricity than all hydropower and solar panels in the 50 states combined, often face years of contention. The entire mid-Atlantic offshore region, an area brimming with wind potential, could be proscribed by Pentagon fretting over interferences with aircraft deployment, Bloomberg News disclosed this week.\n\nBut if red tape for green power is a bother, why not get the benefits with none of the fuss? Send commando teams to the 34 large-scale Bitcoin mining sites in the United States that were identified in a New York Times front-page expos\u00e9 this month. In synchrony, have them sever the facilities\u2019 power cables, which combined demand some 3,900 megawatts of electricity\u2014nearly as much as 3 million households combined.\n\nIn a flash, legions of electricity-gulping, combination-seeking computers in Texas, New York, and 13 other states would cease whirring. Like a power surge but in reverse, the fossil-fuel generators energizing so-called cryptocurrency mining\u2014literally, trillions of combination-seeking calculations every second\u2014would dial down. The corresponding drop in carbon emissions would be the same as if thousands of new industrial-size wind turbines could be instantly erected and connected to grids, supplanting electricity now furnished by burning coal and methane gas. More From Charles Komanoff The Manchin-Schumer Deal Could Pay Off\u2014if Congress Acts August 2, 2022 The Climate Movement in Its Own Way May 2, 2022 The Case Against Closing Nuclear Power Plants April 4, 2022\n\nFanciful? Consider the numbers. The Times helpfully enumerated each Bitcoin mine\u2019s fossil-fueled draw on state and regional power grids along with the associated carbon emissions. It took only a few further steps for me to translate those emissions into generic megawatts of clean power that would defray them. Using today\u2019s customary 300-foot-tall, 3.6-megawatt wind machines as my standard, I calculated a staggering 3,700 turbines.\n\nThere you have it: The US Bitcoin industry is single-handedly neutering the entire climate benefit from nearly 10 percent of US wind energy. That\u2019s more electricity than is generated with wind in any single state, save Texas and Iowa.\n\nThis raises two uncomfortable questions for the climate movement: Why isn\u2019t it rallying against Bitcoin mines and other parasitic users of carbon fuels? And why isn\u2019t it taking the obvious step of calling for a tax on carbon emissions to reduce those usages while simultaneously extracting revenues from them?

Who Is In Charge in the Biden White House? Books & the Arts / Osita Nwanevu Current Issue View our current issue\n\nSecond question first. Generating the electricity consumed by those 34 Bitcoin mines causes 16.4 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to the Times. If the United States had a $100 per ton carbon tax\u2014the current price of carbon emission permits in the European Union\u2019s cap-and-trade system\u2014the carbon levies at the mine mouth and wellhead would be extracting $1.5 billion a year from the fossil fuel companies that power the Bitcoin operations, and depositing it into the Treasury.\n\nTo be sure, that money would only fund a mere 2.4 hours of federal spending a year\u2014barely a single baseball game\u2019s worth, under the new hurry-up-and-pitch rules. On the other hand, the tax moneys are twice what Fox News will pay Dominion Voting Systems under the settlement reached this week. And they\u2019re recurring.\n\nHad the tax been in place a decade ago, as I and others urged, the extra expense might have stopped some cyber-currency ventures from the git-go. But if it were put into place today, a robust carbon tax could at least impel Bitcoin miners to economize on electricity, charge more for transactions, or actually contract with greener power providers rather than merely pretending to, as the Times found.\n\nAlthough no one can pinpoint precisely how a carbon tax would shrink Bitcoin mining\u2019s carbon footprint, let alone any single sector\u2019s, abundant empirical evidence suggests that total US carbon emissions would be around a third less with a triple-digit national carbon tax than without. Bitcoin would not be exempt.\n\nBut it would not be extinguished. That\u2019s where the climate movement comes in.\n\nThe movement has targeted banks and pipelines for more than a decade, with not much to show in the way of lesser carbon emissions. Why isn\u2019t it disrupting Bitcoin mining and other bloodsucking machines\u2014helicopters, private jets, yachts, super-sized SUVs\u2014that feed on fossil fuels and are predominantly playthings of plutocrats? Why isn\u2019t it going all out to stop highway expansions and eliminate restrictive zoning that lock in energy waste for generations?\n\nPut simply, the climate movement is playing the wrong game.\n\nYes, climate activists stopped Keystone XL. They won a ban on fracking in New York. They\u2019re fighting to drive oil drilling out of Los Angeles. Valiant, heroic work. But these and other keep-it-in-the-ground victories are creating little climate benefit. Why? Because the same underlying demand, largely unaffected by those protests, is met by supplies from elsewhere.\n\nThe bank protests seem even less focused. Conoco doesn\u2019t need financing from JPMorgan Chase or Wells Fargo to drill in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The only \u201cbank\u201d it requires is the collective fuel tanks of America\u2019s 280 million motor vehicles, plus aircraft, off-road vehicles, and pleasure boats.\n\nMarching on Citibank does send a message, and activating seniors who might otherwise sit at home posting about their grandkids is soul-stirring. But if divestment and bank-shaming were going to slow the assault on climate, we would have seen bigger results by now.\n\n\u201cIf the world wants to limit warming,\u201d Norwegian energy researcher Espen Erlingsen told the Times this month, \u201cit will have to limit demand for oil and gas because [the] industry can deliver this kind of volume for many more decades.\u201d\n\nAmen. The climate movement\u2019s strategy isn\u2019t working. Trying to bottle up supply instead of throttling demand is whack-a-mole without end, chasing after but never stopping capitalism\u2019s dynamism from erupting in crypto mining and 1,001 other climate-destroying products and technologies.\n\nBy itself, a carbon tax won\u2019t cure that. But it would at least start to steer innovation and cultural norms away from endless new climate horrors.\n\nAs Philip Roth\u2019s Mickey Sabbath might have said: Either tax carbon or bring on the commandos."

Ether rose 8.66% over the week to US$1,923.\n\nBitcoin fell below US$29,000 on Thursday for the first time since April 10, leading to the liquidation of over US$266 million worth of long positions in a 24-hour period, according to futures data provider Coinglass.\n\n\u201cThe drop below US$30,000 may have been [caused] by built-up leverage, which resulted in liquidations, but it\u2019s unlikely to last,\u201d John Isige, an analyst at crypto trading platform Vauld told Forkast in a LinkedIn message. \u201cInvestors can look toward US$27,500 ahead of a larger bounce back above the now pivotal US$30,000.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.19 trillion on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 7% from US$1.28 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data.

It is now pending approval from the European Council.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin, other cryptos fall as investors book profit\n\nBiggest gainers: OKX & CSPR\n\nThe OKX crypto exchange\u2019s utility token (OKB) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap, rising 10.92% to US$52.82. The token started picking up on Monday, after OKX announced that it would add layer-1 blockchain Sui\u2019s token (SUI) to their jumpstart program. This will allow investors to trade OKB for SUI at a discount.\n\nProof-of-stake blockchain Casper Network\u2019s CSPR coin was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer, with an 8.06% price increase to trade at US$0.04919.

The government sold 9,861 Bitcoin (US$279 million) on March 14 and is planning to sell the remaining 41,490 Bitcoin (US$1.1 billion) in four batches this year.\n\nBitcoin values will decline further in the short term as \u201cthe U.S. plans to sell its remaining 41,490 Bitcoin, which I\u2019m expecting to happen soon,\u201d said Kasper Vandeloock, chief executive officer of quantitative trading firm Musca Capital. \u201cBitcoin is up 70%+ year to date. It\u2019s only expected that investors are taking profits or derisk,\u201d he added.\n\nVauld analyst Isige said that US$27,500 will be a key price level next week.\n\n\u201cBitcoin needs a weekly close above US$27,500 or the 50-day EMA on the daily timeframe to weaken its downside potential and confirm an upward trend. Primary support traders will be looking at US$24,000, although US$27,500 is a price level we must watch keenly. Its upside is primarily capped by the seller congestion at US$30,000,\u201d wrote Isige.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns over interest rate hikes in the world\u2019s largest economy have reignited as Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said it is too early to consider pausing interest rate hikes. The U.S. inflation rate dropped to 5% in March, above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\n\u201cConsidering they called inflation \u2018transitory,\u2019 it is reasonable to assume we will get a potentially long and hard recession that affects risk assets, such as Bitcoin. The stock market additionally seems to be setting up for a difficult second half of 2023, which would likely drag Bitcoin and crypto, as well. [As low as] US$9,000 remains in play,\u201d wrote Santos.\n\n\u201cThe price will need to hold above US$30,500 for 5-7 weekdays to confirm the low. Until then, moves to the upside are nothing more than bear market rallies,\u201d he added.\n\nSee related article: Crypto firms hardpressed to find U.S. bank partners as industry blames \u2018Operation Choke Point 2.0\u2019"

        "content": "Despite ongoing turbulence in the cryptocurrency market, Austin-based Unchained Capital has landed $60 million for expansion.\n\nFounded in 2016, the bitcoin financial services firm develops technology for individuals and businesses that store long-term wealth in bitcoin and require private key ownership.\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency \u2014 or cryptocurrency \u2014 that is not backed by any government or central bank. Users can exchange it among themselves without the involvement of traditional intermediaries such as banks and governments.\n\nUnchained has said its bitcoin native ecosystem ensures that users can secure and maximize the value of their bitcoin holdings over multiple generations. The firm currently secures more than $2 billion in bitcoin across thousands of keys, according to the company.\n\nUnchained also offers bitcoin-collateralized loans and said it has originated $500 million of such loans since 2017. Other services include a trading desk, where clients can directly buy bitcoin.\n\nThe Series B funding round was led by Chicago-based Valor Equity Partners, with participation from existing investors NYDIG, Trammell Venture Partners, Ecliptic Capital, and Highland Capital Partners. Unchained has raised a total of $115 million since its launch.\n\nThe new cash infusion will be used to add more clients and expand product development and marketing.\n\nUnchained, which is headquartered in downtown Austin in the Littlefield Building at 601 Congress Ave., has 85 employees and plans to increase its head count 5% per quarter through the end of the year, a company spokesperson said.\n\nHow is the bitcoin market performing?\n\nThe bitcoin market has been a roller coaster ride. Just months ago, all forms of cryptocurrency appeared to be going down in flames, with bitcoin plunging from almost $50,000 at the start of 2022 to less than $17,000 in early 2023.\n\nUnchained wasn\u2019t immune and cut its workforce by 15%, or 16 employees, in mid-November, according to bitcoin trade publications.\n\nBy March, bitcoin had soared more than 60%, but its course forward remains uncertain. Bitcoin slid toward $29,000 Wednesday as traders mulled the likelihood that Federal Reserve rate cuts might be farther out than they thought.\n\nVivek Pattipati, a partner at Valor who will be joining Unchained\u2019s board of directors, acknowledged the challenges but said Unchained is positioned to be a market leader.\n\n\"In the midst of market chaos, Unchained has emerged as a highly trusted provider of bitcoin custody and financial services through superior technology, risk management, regulatory compliance, and client service,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly in lending, the company has differentiated itself by minimizing risk to both the lender and the borrower, leading to resilience and an extraordinary opportunity to capture market share.\"\n\nMore:Austin's job market is confusing. Here's what to know.\n\nWhat's ahead for Austin venture capital and the job market?\n\nVenture capital investment matters to the Central Texas economy because it allows businesses \u2014 both startups and later-stage companies \u2014 to create jobs.\n\nBut with economic uncertainty looming, the level of investment dollars flowing into Austin in 2023 remains to be seen. Last year, despite an overall slowdown in U.S. venture capital funding, Austin startups fared well, scoring the second-highest amount in local history.\n\nAustin-based early stage companies raised $5 billion in funding in 2022, which is down slightly from the record-setting $5.4 billion that startups received in 2021, according to a report by the Austin Chamber of Commerce and Opportunity Austin.\n\nMore:Will dollars keep pouring in for Austin startups in 2023? Here's what experts say\n\nOther Austin deals this year include a $24 million investment in Strangeworks, which designs quantum software tools for software developers, system managers, researchers, technical staffers and chief information officers.\n\nMeanwhile, tech giants with large Austin presences \u2014 including Google, Facebook parent company Meta, Austin-based Tesla and Round Rock-based Dell Technologies \u2014 have all laid off thousands of employees since late last year.\n\nMeta recently announced another major round of layoffs. The company has cut at least 220 Austin jobs, according to a WARN letter \u2014 short for Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.\n\nFacebook said late last year that it would not use an office space it had long anticipated expanding into in downtown Austin. Facebook had signed a lease to occupy all 589,000 square feet of office space in the mixed-use tower called Sixth and Guadalupe, but it now is subleasing the space.\n\nLast month, Austin-based job site Indeed.com said it will lay off 2,200 employees, or roughly 15% of its global team, citing a cooldown in the overall job market and demand for its technology.\n\nMore:See which companies announced layoffs and closings\n\nThe company, which is one of Austin's biggest technology employers, announced the cuts in a blog post of an email sent to employees by Indeed CEO Chris Hyams on Wednesday. Hyams said the cuts come across the company, from nearly every team, function, level and region. He said Indeed also will institute other cost-saving measures.\n\nAdditional material from The Associated Press."

        "title": "The game theory of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies make them an interesting subject for game theory analysis, as they can help explain the incentives and behaviors involved in trading and investing. This article discusses the concept of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, mining cryptocurrencies and blockchain forks that are relevant to the game theory of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nIntroduction to game theory and cryptocurrencies\n\nGame theory is a mathematical framework that helps explain decision-making in strategic situations. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC), have become a popular subject for game theorists due to their decentralized nature and potential to disrupt traditional financial systems.\n\nThe prisoner\u2019s dilemma and cryptocurrency mining\n\nIn the classic game theory scenario known as the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, two parties must make a choice without knowing what the other will do. In the context of cryptocurrency mining, the prisoner\u2019s dilemma can help explain why miners may act in their own self-interest, even if it is not in the best interest of the network as a whole.\n\nThe first miner to successfully solve a challenging mathematical equation receives fresh BTC units. Both computer power and energy usage are essential requirements for the mining operation. The tragedy of the commons, which happens when individuals prioritize their own interests over the needs of the whole, is one of the biggest obstacles in cryptocurrency mining. By mining cryptocurrencies, miners may put their individual financial gain ahead of the network\u2019s overall security and stability.\n\nA helpful foundation for comprehending this behavior is provided by the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. In the scenario, two people are arrested for a crime, and they are offered the option to work together or turn on one another. If they both cooperate, their sentences are both lowered. When one betrays the other, the betrayer is given a lighter punishment, while the other is given a lengthier one. Both receive a moderate penalty if they betray one another.\n\nRelated: How does blockchain solve the Byzantine generals problem?\n\nMiners confront a similar decision-making process while mining cryptocurrencies. The network is safe and secure if all miners collaborate by mining honestly and making a contribution. Yet one miner may benefit more from mining maliciously or not contributing to the network if they choose to behave in their own self-interest.\n\nLet's look at the below diagram illustrating an example of two miners in a cryptocurrency pool to understand how the prisoner's dilemma can be applied to the context of cryptocurrency mining.\n\nIn the above diagram, Miner A and Miner B are two miners in a cryptocurrency mining pool. They have the choice to cooperate (continue mining together) or defect (leave the pool and mine independently). The rewards and payoffs are based on the classic prisoner's dilemma scenario:\n\nIf both miners cooperate, they both receive a reward (e.g. a share of the mining profits).\n\nIf Miner A defects while Miner B cooperates, Miner A receives a temptation payoff (e.g. a larger share of the mining profits), while Miner B receives a suckers payoff (e.g. a smaller share of the mining profits).\n\nIf Miner A cooperates while Miner B defects, Miner A receives a suckers payoff, while Miner B receives a temptation payoff.\n\nIf both miners defect, they both receive a punishment (e.g. lower overall mining profits).\n\nThis diagram illustrates how the prisoner's dilemma can be applied to the context of cryptocurrency mining. It shows the potential rewards and payoffs for each combination of cooperation and defection, and can help miners make decisions about whether to stay in a pool or mine independently.\n\nThe defector will receive a larger share of the profits because they are not sharing their earnings with the other miner. On the other hand, the cooperator who remained in the pool will receive a smaller share of the rewards because they are now contributing more computing power but still receiving the same share of the rewards as before.\n\nTo address this challenge, cryptocurrency networks can implement various incentives and mechanisms to encourage miners to act in the interest of the network as a whole. For example, networks can reward miners who contribute to the network with lower fees or increased mining rewards. Additionally, networks can implement penalties or defensive mechanisms to discourage malicious behavior.\n\nThe game theory of blockchain forks\n\nBlockchain forks are another scenario where game theory can help explain the decision-making process of participants. A fork occurs when a blockchain network splits into two separate paths, often due to disagreements among participants about the direction of the network.\n\nA fork can be thought of as a coordination game from the perspective of game theory. Two or more players must work together to attain a common objective in a coordination game. Participants in a blockchain fork must work together to decide which fork to promote and which to reject.\n\nThe Bitcoin network split into two distinct forks in 2017: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This is one of the most well-known instances of a blockchain fork. Disagreements within the Bitcoin community on how to expand the network to handle an increasing volume of transactions led to the creation of this fork.\n\nIn this case, members of the Bitcoin community had to choose between sticking with the old Bitcoin network and switching to the new Bitcoin Cash network. The choice was not easy because each fork has pros and cons of its own. For instance, while Bitcoin Cash offered quicker transaction times and lower fees, Bitcoin had a larger network and higher acceptance.\n\nParticipants in this scenario had to take into account their personal preferences and opinions regarding the potential future worth of each network in the context of game theory. Participants would be motivated to promote Bitcoin Cash even if it meant leaving the original Bitcoin network if they thought it had a stronger chance of long-term growth.\n\nRelated: How to buy Bitcoin Cash: A beginner\u2019s guide for buying BCH\n\nLet's look at the below diagram, illustrating two miners facing the choice of whether to adopt a new fork in the blockchain or continue on the old fork to understand how game theory can be applied to the context of blockchain forks.\n\nThe above diagram depicts the strategic decision-making of two miners, Miner A and Miner B, on a blockchain, as they face the choice of either adopting a new fork or continuing on the old fork. The rewards and penalties are based on the following assumptions:\n\nIf both miners adopt the new fork, they both receive a reward (e.g. increased mining efficiency).\n\nIf Miner A adopts the new fork while Miner B continues on the old fork, Miner A receives a penalty (e.g. decreased mining efficiency), while Miner B receives a reward.\n\nIf Miner A continues on the old fork while Miner B adopts the new fork, Miner A receives a reward, while Miner B receives a penalty.\n\nIf both miners continue on the old fork, they both receive a temptation payoff (e.g. maintaining control over the blockchain).\n\nThis diagram illustrates how game theory can be applied to the context of blockchain forks. It shows the potential rewards and penalties for each combination of adopting or not adopting a new fork, and can help miners make decisions about whether to switch to a new fork or stick with the current one.\n\nTo address this challenge, cryptocurrency networks can implement various mechanisms to ensure that forks occur as smoothly as possible. For example, networks can implement replay protection, which prevents transactions on one network from being replayed on the other."

        "content": "Babylon, a crypto security blockchain using Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work security to integrate with proof-of-stake chains, plans to expand beyond the Cosmos.\n\nDesigned by David Tse and his team at Stanford\u2019s Blockchain Consensus Protocol Lab, Babylon was created using the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK). It communicates with Bitcoin through a Bitcoin timestamping protocol.\n\nThis means that it interacts with the Bitcoin chain by sending events on Babylon onto the Bitcoin chain, Tse told Blockworks in an interview.\n\nIn Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original Bitcoin white paper, the author noted how they wanted to build Bitcoin to become a timestamping server, Tse said.\n\n\u201cIn his case, he was interested in timestamping Bitcoin transactions,\u201d Tse said. \u201cIt turns out that you can also put arbitrary data onto the Bitcoin chain, so this allows you to timestamp not only Bitcoin transactions but also events happening outside of the Bitcoin chain.\u201d\n\nUsing this knowledge, Babylon is able to timestamp events occurring on different proof-of-stake chains.\n\nRead more: The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Consensus Mechanisms\n\nWait, so how does it make the blockchain more secure?\n\nExisting proof-of-stake chains such as Osmosis already have a handful of validators signing off on transactions.\n\nWhat Babylon does through Bitcoin timestamps is bring in a second-level committee to certify the transaction.\n\n\u201cFor smaller transactions of $1,000 or a few hundred, the proof-of-stake committee is enough \u2014 they\u2019re fast to validate and approve transactions, but if you have a transaction that has very high value or transactions that actually affect the security of the proof-of-stake chain, that will deserve an extra level of protection from Bitcoin,\u201d Tse said.\n\nAn example Tse notes would be unbinding transactions, where the transaction itself will affect the security of the validators. \u201cBitcoin is slower, but it has a much higher level of security,\u201d he said\n\nBabylon is currently integrated with 16 different app chains on their testnets that have a value of $1.4 billion. These 16 different app chains are secured using Bitcoin\u2019s $600 billion.\n\nBeyond the Cosmos\n\nBabylon currently exists as a testnet and plans to launch its mainnet in Q3 or A4, Tse said.\n\nThe Cosmos ecosystem has been its focus for a handful of reasons \u2014 notably its powerful interoperability capabilities through its inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) which enables automatic time stamping from all these chains to Babylon, but also due to its diverse app chain ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThis gives us very broad exposure to different kinds of applications\u2026We learn quite a bit working with them and understanding how they want to use Bitcoin security,\u201d Tse said.\n\nAlthough this is the case, Babylon is also looking at ways it can expand beyond the Cosmos. This is currently being explored in two different directions, one of which is implementing smart contracts on Babylon that create timestamping.\n\n\u201cThis allows us to go outside the Cosmos ecosystem\u2026it doesn\u2019t even have to be chains, it could be specific applications that are running on Ethereum that want additional security,\u201d Tse said. \u201cBitcoin is very powerful, very secure, but it has a very big limitation\u2026which is it doesn\u2019t have smart contracts, so Babylon deals with the difficult work of interacting with the not-so-smart chain Bitcoin and enables it to interact with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nThe second direction, Tse notes, is to integrate with interoperable chains \u2014 such as Axelar.\n\n\u201cAxelar is interoperable with many chains outside the Cosmos, then we can get timestamps for all these chains Axelar is integrated with as well,\u201d he said.\n\nUsing Bitcoin security to build dapp projects\n\nInstead of competing directly with Ethereum, Tse believes it is possible to bring existing proof-of-stake chains to an even more secure Bitcoin through interoperability.\n\n\u201cEthereum has been very successful in building an ecosystem that incorporates brilliant new technology,\u201d Tse said. \u201cSo what we\u2019re saying here is that Bitcoin is an arguably even more secure chain and it has a 14-year history.\u201d\n\nBabylon is not the only project that Tse and his team are working on.\n\nUsing ordinal technology, Tse and his team are currently looking into ways to use Bitcoin block space to eliminate censorship of transactions on proof-of-stake chains.\n\n\u201cYou could put these transactions onto the Bitcoin block space and because Bitcoin has [a] very strong censorship resistance property, that would allow that transaction to survive the censorship\u2026 that is another type of protocol that is on our roadmap,\u201d Tse said.\n\nRead more: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: Which Is Better?\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining heat is energy gold. Let's make use of it - Forkast News",
        "content": "Despite concerns over Bitcoin mining\u2019s energy consumption, Bitcoin mining has the potential to be a net positive for humanity\u2019s relationship with energy and sustainability. This can be achieved by the mining industry using intermittent, stranded and waste power sources and subsidizing sustainable energy. A less-explored opportunity is to collect and redirect the excess heat generated by Bitcoin mining for other heating needs. This Earth Day, let us consider how Bitcoin mining can not only help our planet and improve humanity\u2019s relationship with energy by serving as a buyer of zero-carbon energy, but it can also serve as a producer of recyclable and reusable energy.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s energy recycling potential\n\nMany of Bitcoin\u2019s critics are understandably worried about Bitcoin\u2019s rising energy consumption. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s electricity consumption has only ever gone up since the digital asset\u2019s inception. Similarly, Bitcoin\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 although there have been ups and downs \u2014 have also grown over time.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is not the whole story.\n\nBitcoin mining produces a lot of heat, and harnessing and redirecting that excess heat is not just a theoretical possibility. In fact, there are already plans for a Canadian city to be heated by Bitcoin miners. An energy provider, Lonsdale Energy Corporation, and MintGreen, a Bitcoin mining company, are partnering up to provide at least some of the heat demanded by the residents of North Vancouver.\n\nMintGreen will recycle about 20,000 tons of toxic gas per megawatt that would have otherwise entered the atmosphere and contributed to global warming. Instead, this liability of toxic emissions will be turned into an asset: Over 95% of the energy that the miners initially consume will be converted into thermal energy that will be used to heat several buildings. Since Bitcoin miners can run continuously, and because there will almost certainly always be a supply of Bitcoin miners available, the city will be able to rely on their excess heat during any month of any year.\n\nThis endeavor is not a pie-in-the-sky dream. MintGreen had already made deals with the Vancouver Island Sea Salt facility and Shelter Point Distillery to sell them heat during frigid Canadian winters.\n\nBitcoin mining\u2019s versatility also allows its excess heat to be used for recreational ends. For example, it costs between US$2,000 and US$5,000 to heat a typical swimming pool. Bitcoin mining can turn this money sink and associated energy consumption into a zero-cost endeavor. All you have to do is connect your Bitcoin mining machine to your pool\u2019s water pump. You simultaneously earn the hardest asset ever created and heat your pool at no additional charge.\n\nWhile heating a swimming pool is an amusing application, Bitcoin miners\u2019 excess heat has more profound use cases for humanity. Companies are already collaborating with researchers to create greenhouses that are heated by Bitcoin mining.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the heat from Bitcoin mining is warming a greenhouse for tulips and cutting the flower farmers\u2019 reliance on gas, which has become more expensive since Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. In Sweden, another mining company\u2019s 600-kilowatt ASIC machines\u2019 heat is directed toward warming a 300-square-meter greenhouse in which fruit and vegetables are grown. The miners are embedded in a data center container, which is fitted with an air duct apparatus that draws heat from the ASICs and sends it to the greenhouse. In theory, this would keep the greenhouse at 77 degrees Fahrenheit continuously. Considering that the temperature of the area drops to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit in wintertime, the potential savings on heat costs and use are significant.\n\nJust as Bitcoin mining can make good use of intermittent, stranded and waste energy sources, recycling and reusing miners\u2019 waste heat can potentially increase the profitability and sustainability of indoor farming and food production. As one researcher said, \u201cA 1 [megawatt] data center would have the ability to strengthen the local self-sufficiency up to 8% with products that are competitive on the market.\u201d\n\nSimmering tensions\n\nNot everyone is excited about Bitcoin miners\u2019 heat, especially those who suffer from its unintended consequences. For example, residents near Seneca Lake in upstate New York have complained that a nearby power plant\u2019s collaboration with over 8,000 miners has caused their lake to \u201cfeel like you\u2019re in a hot tub.\u201d\n\nThe power plant takes in 139 million gallons of water from the lake and gives back 135 million gallons every day. The water that is recycled back into the lake gets up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. To be sure, solutions can in principle be found, but we must nevertheless admit that sometimes miners\u2019 heat can affect a community\u2019s environment in ways that people do not enjoy.\n\nSustainable energy sources still matter\n\nAside from Bitcoin mining helping subsidize renewable energy, our ability to harness and direct its excess heat is yet another way that Bitcoin can help combat climate change. Less than a decade ago, Imperial College London estimated that heating residential and commercial buildings accounted for almost half of all energy consumption and 40% of all energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. If all of this heat could be provided by carbon-neutral sources, it could be the most revolutionary impact on climate change in a generation.\n\nOn the face of it, replacing carbon-emitting heat sources with the excess heat of Bitcoin miners may not make enough of a difference. After all, if Bitcoin miners are themselves fueled by carbon-intensive fuel sources, then heating one\u2019s home with miners\u2019 excess heat does not necessarily reduce enough emissions for us to meet our climate goals.\n\nBut Bitcoin miners are unique in their ability to render viable renewable energy sources that would have not been profitable in the miners\u2019 absence. Heating commercial and residential buildings with miners\u2019 excess heat really could help put a dent in humanity\u2019s carbon emissions \u2014 provided that the miners themselves are powered by, say, solar energy.\n\nWe have already seen that heating buildings and powering indoor farms with Bitcoin miners\u2019 excess heat is not a pipe dream but a reality. It may not be a big leap to imagine what a difference it could make on our planet if Bitcoin miners could themselves be fueled entirely by carbon-neutral sources."

        "content": "Bitcoin slid below the US$29,000 mark for the first time in 10 days on Thursday morning in Asia. Ether also fell to lose hold of the US$2,000 price support in a sell off across all top 10 non-stablecoin tokens. Some commentators ascribed the declines to a repricing based on recent concerns about inflation and higher interest rates ahead. Litecoin led the losers. U.S. equity futures dipped after Wall Street closed flat to lower on Wednesday.\n\nSee related article: US chip giant Intel abandons Bitcoin ASIC production\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin fell 4.59% to US$28,943 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 3.59%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency lost about US$1,000 in an hour starting from 4:00 p.m. Hong Kong on Wednesday.\n\nEther slumped 7.20% to US$1,947, but remains 1.93% higher for the past seven days. The token traded below the US$2,000 mark for the first time since April 13, when the Ethereum blockchain completed its Shanghai upgrade.\n\nLitecoin led the losers with a drop of 10.50% in the past 24 hours and traded at US$90.85, falling 1.39% for the week.\n\nThe latest selloff in cryptocurrencies is an overdue correction following the rally this year and investors taking profits as a risk-off trend emerged in global markets, according to a CNBC report on Wednesday citing Joel Kruger, market strategist at forex and crypto platform Lmax Group.\n\nThe risk-off mood follows more global inflation signals. The U.K. on Wednesday reported a 10.1% annual increase in the consumer price index for March, beating projections for a 9.8% gain. Also this week, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said it\u2019s too early to consider an interest rate cut, given the stubborn U.S. inflation rate, which stood at 5% in March, compared to the Fed\u2019s goal of 2%.\n\nLmax Group tweeted on Thursday the crypto market \u201chas been forced to have a serious rethink about how it has been pricing\u201d with respect to monetary policies.\n\nAnother down arrow is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s testimony before Congress on Tuesday, where he said much of the business model of the cryptocurrency sector has been built around non-compliance with securities regulations.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 5.04% in the past 24 hours to US$1.21 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 33.08% to US$62.36 billion.\n\nIn the NFT market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.23% to 4,012.98 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but remained 0.74% higher for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.11%. The S&P 500 futures fell 0.24%. The Nasdaq Composite Index moved down 0.35%.\n\nThe three U.S. equity indexes stalled on Wednesday on softer first-quarter earning reports, while the Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book survey on economic conditions published on Wednesday shows a sharp fall in lending after the failure of a trio of regional banks last month.\n\nNegatives for crypto from the bank failures include \u201cdwindling liquidity driven by strong risk-off sentiments and regulatory pressures impacting banking access for the sector,\u201d Ben Ritchie, director of Digital Capital Management AU said in a report by information services platform Finder.\n\nU.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006. Analysts at the CME Group now see a 16.7% chance the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting on May 3, while 83.3% predict a 25-basis-point increase, down from 84.8% on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates to correct Bitcoin price decline in second sentence of first bullet.)\n\nSee related article: Trump\u2019s Series 2 sells out, tops daily NFT sales chart"

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "To say that Bitcoin (BTC -0.07%) has been on a tear in 2023 would be an understatement: The world's leading cryptocurrency is up more than 70% so far this year as of April 20. This gain not only easily outpaces the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, but it is also a greater rise than Ethereum, another popular digital asset.\n\nAfter eclipsing the $30,000 mark, investors might be thinking of a much larger target to set their eyes on. Can Bitcoin reach $100,000? While it might not happen this year, there is a very real possibility that it will occur in the next five. Here's why.\n\nAll eyes on the Fed\n\nJust around the time when the Federal Reserve indicated that inflation might not be so transitory after all, Bitcoin peaked at nearly $69,000, in November 2021. Throughout 2022, when the central bank hiked interest rates at the fastest pace in history, the digital currency got crushed, losing 65%, a much bigger loss than the stock market and about in line with the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nInvestors can glean one very important insight from this type of price action. For now, it's evident that Bitcoin trades more like a growth tech stock, influenced by macroeconomic news like recent inflation data or the Fed's actions. At the start of this year, risk assets have generally performed well, a possible sign that investors think rate hikes are coming to an end soon.\n\nAnd Bitcoin is up significantly since the start of the regional-bank fiasco more than a month ago. Perhaps investors also view this top digital asset as a safe and reliable holding amid the turmoil. While these catalysts can drive greater demand for Bitcoin, I don't think they are enough to push the price to $100,000, especially not in 2023.\n\nBitcoin as a store of value\n\nThese catalysts do, however, bring more attention to Bitcoin, which should benefit over the long term as more dollars flow in as well, despite the inevitable ups and downs. I think Bitcoin's most compelling use centers on it becoming a more widely adopted store of value, something that individual and institutional investors will propel. And the growing number of businesses that provide easy access to buying Bitcoin will make it more accessible to the masses.\n\nBut this raises the question: What fundamental reason is there that would make investors want to buy and hold Bitcoin over extended periods of time? Bulls point to one thing and one thing only, and that is the fact that there will only ever be 21 million coins in circulation, an absolutely finite cap that should support a higher price many years from now. And in about a year, Bitcoin's block reward for processing transactions will be cut in half, usually a positive indicator for its price trajectory.\n\nWhat's more relatable is Bitcoin's superiority when inflation is still soaring and governments all over the world -- including the U.S. -- have debased their currencies throughout history. More dollars chasing fewer bitcoins bodes well for the latter's future price. And although Bitcoin won't move in lockstep with the consumer price index, its total return of nearly 48,000,000% (since July 2010, based on the earliest data provided by coinmarketcap.com) certainly proves that it not only preserves purchasing power, but also raises it.\n\nAccording to consulting firm McKinsey & Co., the total global net worth was more than $600 trillion at the end of 2021. This means that Bitcoin's current market cap of $590 billion accounts for less than 0.1% of this astronomical value, even after its huge run-up this year. This means there is still a very long runway for the crypto to find itself in more portfolios.\n\nTo be fair, to get from Bitcoin's current price to $100,000 in five years, there needs to be regulatory clarity, especially in the U.S., allowing the country to lead development of the global framework for this asset class.\n\nEven more important, people just need to learn more about Bitcoin's value proposition in the broader financial landscape. Once this happens, it's hard not to be bullish."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Mining Stocks Dropped Like a Rock This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nAfter some recovery over the past few weeks, Bitcoin (BTC -0.07%) miners had a rough go of it this week. The value of Bitcoin is down 7.6% in the past week as of noon ET on Friday, and that leads to a lot of lost value for miners and related companies.\n\nAccording to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, shares of Canaan (CAN -1.44%) have fallen 15.7% since Friday's close, HIVE Blockchain (HIVE -0.32%) is down 17%, Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%) has dropped 17.6%, Hut 8 Mining (HUT) is down 16.9%, and Cipher Mining (CIFR 7.81%) has fallen 22.7%. But will the drop continue?\n\nSo what\n\nYou can see in the chart below how these companies follow the price of Bitcoin, at least over the short term. And with good reason.\n\nWhether you're mining Bitcoin or creating chips or other products for miners, the price of Bitcoin itself is very important. It's the equivalent to the price of a commodity for miners in the commodity industry. If the price falls, so does revenue.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, miners often hold Bitcoin they mine on the balance sheet. This puts additional leverage on these companies, making the volatility worse both when Bitcoin goes up and when it goes down.\n\nThe reliance on high Bitcoin prices is evident when you start looking at net income for each of these companies.\n\nThey need Bitcoin to remain elevated to make money. If the bounce above $30,000 doesn't hold, they might continue losing money.\n\nNow what\n\nWhat's not clear at this point is whether the Bitcoin rally will continue. There's been renewed interest in blockchain assets after the U.S. began cracking down on some companies in the wake of SVB's failure, but both could actually lead to the U.S. crypto industry being even smaller.\n\nInternationally, the news is better, with countries like the U.K. and Hong Kong creating rules that make crypto easier to own. It's possible that the U.S. will follow a similar path eventually, given Congressional pressure, but that has yet to happen.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for these miners is that competition is much stronger than it has been in previous crypto cycles. Some other blockchains are faster, cheaper, and less energy intensive, reducing the market opportunity for Bitcoin.\n\nCombine that with miners' reliance on the price of Bitcoin itself, and this is a tough business in which to generate long-term value. Most Bitcoin mining companies are just leveraged plays on Bitcoin, and investors who are looking for exposure to Bitcoin can just buy the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nI have not been bullish on Bitcoin miners for a long time, and this week's move is a good example of why. They carry more risk than Bitcoin and often just exaggerate the cryptocurrency's moves."

        "content": "Fresh data from Glassnode demonstrates that Bitcoin's (BTC) Lightning Network is significantly cheaper to use than legacy payment networks.\n\nThe median fee rate, or the cost of sending value across the Lightning Network, is 0.0029%, 1,000 times cheaper than that of Mastercard or Visa payment processors.\n\nJames Check, the lead analyst at Glassnode, told Cointelegraph that the median fee rate, or the fee charged per 1 BTC sent across the Lightning Network, is currently 3,000 satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin). That is \u201cequivalent to $0.84 to send $28,800 worth of value [...,] which is a fee of 0.0029%.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty remarkable when you think about it.\u201d\n\nIn a post on the Nostr social media protocol, Bitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair noted that this rate is many times less than that charged by major credit card companies.\n\nThe Lightning Network, a layer-2 payments solution built atop the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, was first proposed as a way to make Bitcoin effective as a payment method. These data points demonstrate that it is not only fast but low-cost, with the mean fee rate steadily trending lower since November 2021.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nLegacy payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard charge merchants a fee of around 2-3% per transaction, making them an expensive option for businesses. In an upcoming Cointelegraph documentary shot in Cape Verde, the business owner of one of the few businesses to accept Bitcoin explained that accepting foreign Visa and Mastercard costs over 8%.\n\nMoreover, Glassnode\u2019s Check referred to users who run their own nodes and manage their own channels. Many Lightning users take advantage of custodial wallets, such as the Wallet of Satoshi and Alby, to make micropayments on social media apps such as Nostr.\n\nSome Bitcoin early adopters have noted the growing preference for custodial solutions (the Bitcoiner mantra is \u201cnot your keys, not your coin\u201d), although semi-custodial solutions such as Fedi and Cashu could undermine reliance on fully custodial solutions.\n\nRelated: MicroStrategy\u2019s Saylor fuses work email address with Bitcoin Lightning\n\nFurthermore, the throughput of the Lightning Network could be called into question. Check explained:\n\n\u201cOf course, we must also consider that the typical channel is smaller than 1 BTC. The median channel size is 0.02 BTC and the mean is 0.08 BTC, so overall the Lightning Network remains well suited to payments below $1,000.\u201d\n\nIn the below graph, the channel size is trending higher but still well under $10,000. In such an environment, payments over $1,000 may be better suited to the Bitcoin base chain in order to avoid payment failure or misfire.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "content": "Bitcoin-focused derivatives exchange Bitnomial is rolling out block trading for the first time in an industry bid to capitalize on a long time traditional finance practice, as US institutional interest in bitcoin and ether options has booked a marked uptick.\n\nOpen interest in the US and in other countries plummeted in the fourth quarter of 2022 as digital asset markets collapsed. But in the first quarter of this year, open interest, a metric that reflects the number of outstanding contracts on a given unsettled options contract, has recovered.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was down about 7% in the last seven days through the stock market close in New York on Thursday.\n\nIn terms of bitcoin options on Deribit, \u201crecovered\u201d is an understatement \u2014 they hit an all-time high last month, as previously reported by Blockworks. Volume on Deribit, long one of the world\u2019s largest bitcoin and cryptocurrency option exchanges, exceeded $20 billion at the time, the company said.\n\nOptions on digital assets in the US are limited to bitcoin and ether (ETH) by regulators.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Blockworks on Thursday, Bitnomial President Michael Dunn said the exchange is rolling out block trading this week because \u201cnow\u2019s a good time as we see a lot of crypto-native firms coming in\u201d to the bitcoin options trading space with dry powder to splurge.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve been asking, according to Dunn, for customized baskets of bitcoin option books specifically. Crypto hedge fund managers, family offices and other types of traders typically shop around for market makers on digital asset options, often tapping a number of counterparties to try to lock in the best possible price, coupled with the best possible execution.\n\nBlock trading is an over the counter (OTC) arrangement that results in an agreement between a market maker and a buy side counterparty to take on a specified number of derivatives at a specified cost of carry.\n\nIt\u2019s more time consuming than executing an algorithmic trade on BTC options tied to underlying bitcoins. But traders find the practice worthwhile if they\u2019re buying in enough bulk that they snap up futures contracts at a discount to where the market is pricing the cost of opening and closing them.\n\n\u201cCrypto native [traders], they came knocking on our door saying, \u2018Hey, you guys have a lit order book and electronic execution, that\u2019s great. But we\u2019re looking to do more complex, structured trades that actually make sense to do atomically and in bigger size and kind of poke around and do block deals.\u201d\n\nBelow are some additional excerpts from Blockworks\u2019 interview with Dunn, who formerly worked in the Chicago options trading scene and has experience with quantitative market making of options on traditional option classes as a result.\n\nBlockworks: Given your and the exchange\u2019s background on the algorithmic side of things, what\u2019s your take on trends you\u2019ve been noticing from a technical perspective? What\u2019s been interesting to you generally, institutional or retail moves from a trading perspective?\n\nMichael Dunn; Source: Bitnomial\n\nDunn: There is something kind of fascinating that we noticed.\n\nBack in December of last year is when we noticed that backwardation occurred in the bitcoin futures curve in our markets and other comparable markets like CME \u2014 which is fascinating to us, because that just creates a lot of opportunity for people who have bitcoin on their balance sheet to go in and capture those spreads and actually make money moving Bitcoin into the futures ecosystem, which is really awesome.\n\nThat\u2019s a real advantage our exchange has because CME is a cash-settled product. So, moving your bitcoin to capture those spreads, it\u2019s very difficult. There\u2019s a lot of slippage. You\u2019re doing a lot of weird trades to get in and out of that product \u2026\n\nNow, from the end of the quarter last year to now, we\u2019re seeing more of a steepening of the curve, which is what I would expect given the interest rate environment that we\u2019re in right now.\n\nBlockworks: Who do you view as your direct competition now?\n\nDunn: That\u2019s a great question. If I\u2019m going to be honest, nobody.\n\nWe\u2019re the only ones that are focusing on the physical deliverable space in the US, the only ones that are continuing to build that out. And I think that\u2019s obvious from our customers who we talked to. There\u2019s just not a lot of options out there.\n\nBlockworks: How would you answer that same question last fall?\n\nDunn: I\u2019ll be honest, the way that we view [or viewed] other exchanges, particularly FTX, is that we didn\u2019t really view them as competition.\n\nBecause ultimately, it\u2019s a different customer base. You had a lot of US firms that were setting up these offshore businesses to go and trade those. But that necessarily wasn\u2019t our target market.\n\nLook, when you look at a lot of the US firms now, they\u2019re not willing to set up those offshore companies. They\u2019re not. It\u2019s too much risk for them \u2014 particularly after the FTX collapse.\n\nThat\u2019s actually been great marketing for us because you know, like, even look at Deribit. There\u2019s a lot of platform risks there that are being underappreciated from a risk perspective. One thing we saw with Deribit: it had [at one point] like $20 billion of open interest.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nBitnomial\u2019s trading team booked its first block trade in recent weeks, which was executed between crypto trading firm DV Chain and Electric Capital, a long time digital assets-focused investment manager with a venture capital arm and other investment strategies under its trading purview.\n\nA spokesperson for the company told Blockworks that the exchange\u2019s largest transaction was booked on April 5, adding that Bitnomial\u2019s interest \u201chit record levels since the beginning of\u201d the first quarter.\n\nDunn said that the exchange\u2019s view is that competition is coming, and that it\u2019s \u201cwhen, not if\u201d that Wall Street banks start making markets on crypto options in real numbers.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

This represents a 63.54% increase in mining difficulty over the year.\n\nThe mining difficulty has spiked in the majority of the adjustments. Over the past year, there have been only five instances where it decreased.\n\nMining difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is for miners to find a valid hash for a block of transactions. It adjusts approximately every two weeks, or every 2,016 blocks, to maintain a stable block time of roughly 10 minutes.\n\nA higher mining difficulty makes it more challenging for miners to mine new blocks, which in turn makes the network more secure.\n\nThis increased security comes as a result of the computational power required to carry out a successful attack, which becomes increasingly difficult as mining difficulty rises.\n\nThe record high mining difficulty is a testament to the strength and resilience of the Bitcoin network, as it continues to attract more miners and investment."

        "content": "Legendary investor Warren Buffett sees no value in Bitcoin (BTC), infamously calling it \u201crat poison squared.\u201d But data shows that adding Bitcoin to a so-called \u201crat poison portfolio,\u201d an equally weighted portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway, Microsoft, JPMorgan and BlackRock stocks, would have produced much better returns for The Oracle of Omaha.\n\n\u201cRat poison portfolio\u201d with Bitcoin does better\n\nSince 2014, allocating only 2.5% Bitcoin yearly to the rat poison portfolio increases returns by nearly 20% with reduced risks, according to independent market analyst Alpha Zeta. For now, the portfolio\u2019s returns stand around 16%.\n\nRat poison portfolio with Bitcoin allocations.

Source: Alpha Zeta\n\nIn other words, BTC typically negates losses imposed by downside movements in the said stocks. Therefore, allocating a small portion of Bitcoin to the rat poison portfolio has proven to be a reasonable hedging strategy to offset potential negative returns.\n\nBitcoin has outperformed Berkshire Hathaway by 320,000%\n\nBitcoin proponents have projected it as an alternative to traditional safe-haven assets, such as gold, given the scarcity that comes with its fixed supply of 21 million BTC and increasing deflation over time.\n\nThis has attracted many people to buy Bitcoin as a way of offsetting fiat debasement and excessive money printing by central banks around the world. For instance, the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses has grown from around 2,500 in 2009 to over 45 million in 2023, per Glassnode.\n\nThe number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses since 2009.

        "title": "Anticipation of Bitcoin Halving Fuels Crypto ETFs - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The price of bitcoin has been soaring lately and a once-every-four-years event could keep upward pressure on the cryptocurrency.\n\nSince the start of the year, bitcoin has risen from around $16,500 to $30,000, a gain of more than 80%. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which closely tracks bitcoin futures, has delivered a similar return.\n\nThough there are many reasons for bitcoin\u2019s recent ascent\u2014including a decline in long-term interest rates and rising appetite for risk among investors\u2014one catalyst that applies to bitcoin specifically is what\u2019s known as the halving.\n\nTo process transactions and keep the blockchain secure, bitcoin relies on the participation of entities called miners who contribute enormous amounts of computing power to the network. In return, the miners receive block rewards (freshly minted bitcoin) as compensation.\n\nThese block rewards are cut in half every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. Currently, block rewards are 6.25 bitcoin per block, and they will fall to 3.125 bitcoin per block after the next halving.\n\nHistorically, the price of bitcoin has risen before, and after these supply reductions, there are many who believe that this time will be no different.\n\nAccording to data from CoinTelegraph, the price of bitcoin was at least 15% higher 150 days after each of the previous three halvings.\n\n\n\nSeparate data from CCData shows that bitcoin rallied ahead of each of those halvings also. The cryptocurrency jumped by 19% in the 12 months leading up to the May 2020 halving; it gained 142% leading up to the July 2016 halving; and it surged 384% leading up to the first halving in November 2012.\n\nAdding Fuel to Crypto ETFs\n\nGiven the strong historical precedent, anticipation of the next bitcoin halving\u2014which is estimated to take place in April or May of 2024\u2014is adding fuel to this year\u2019s bitcoin rally.\n\nIn addition to bitcoin futures tracking ETFs like BITO, funds that hold stocks of companies in the cryptocurrency industry are also rallying on halving excitement.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) and the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) are up anywhere from 90% to 130% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nThese ETFs tend to rise and fall with cryptocurrencies, so anything that pushes bitcoin prices higher is generally a good thing for them.\n\nNo Guarantees\n\nWhile the bitcoin halving was a bullish catalyst for bitcoin in the past, there\u2019s no assurance that history will repeat itself. As with anything in markets, past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nAs bitcoin matures, it won\u2019t necessarily act like it did in its early days. The bullish thesis behind the halving is that with each reduction in block rewards, bitcoin becomes scarcer because there is less new supply coming onto the market.\n\nThat\u2019s true\u2014but it\u2019s also well-known. Bitcoin is designed to have a maximum supply of 21 million; everybody knows that, and in markets, what everybody knows usually isn\u2019t information that can leveraged into outsized returns.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean history won\u2019t repeat and bitcoin runs up into the halving and keeps running for a while after.\n\nBut it\u2019s something that a prudent investor probably shouldn\u2019t bet the farm on.\n\nFollow Sumit Roy on Twitter @sumitroy2\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

Secure your seat today\n\nThe increase in bitcoin's (BTC) dominance rate, or the largest cryptocurrency's share of the overall crypto market, has halted, hinting at the potential outperformance of alternative tokens known as altcoins ahead.\n\nAltcoins are any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin.\n\nData from TradingView show bitcoin's dominance rate rose to 48% from 42% during the first quarter and has struggled to surpass that level so far this month.\n\nThe metric has oscillated between 38% and 48% for almost two years, with declines from 46% to 48% coinciding with outsized gains in altcoins.\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s dominance could peak out, this would signal that altcoins would outperform,\" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, said in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin's dominance rate's previous declines from 48% coincided with the altcoin market boom. (CoinDesk/TradingView)\n\nThe chart shows that the total market cap of altcoins (white line, blue arrows) rose more than 60% to $1.39 trillion in the two months after the BTC dominance rate turned lower from 48% in July 2021. Similar bearish turnarounds in the dominance rate in mid-October 2021 and June 2022 also pushed altcoin valuations higher.\n\nHistory could repeat itself, according to Thielen.\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s dominance appears to be peaking out at similar levels as in 2022 \u2013 accounting for 45/46% of the total crypto market capitalization,\" Thielen said. \"For bitcoin to continue outperforming the rest of the ecosystem would imply that only bitcoin matters, which appears to be unlikely considering the intellectual and financial firepower that is being deployed on other chains.\n\n\"Bitcoin benefited from U.S. liquidity, but going forward, this could change,\" he said."

As Peter explains, the win for Real Bedford is a win for Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cThis is going to sound really cringy. It\u2019s not my team; it\u2019s our team. But it is. It\u2019s our team. It\u2019s our Bitcoin team.\u201d\n\nBitcoin advocates worldwide tuned into live streams of the game during the 2023 season, while stories of Bitcoin soccer fans from Slovakia traveling to Bedford to paint the town red have become local legend. The team has given British Bitcoin advocates a headquarters and Bitcoin sports lovers worldwide a team to rally around.\n\nRelated: UK think tank launches a crusade against \u2018surveillance\u2019 CBDCs\n\nHowever, McCormack is reluctant to push Bitcoin the currency onto his local town: \u201cI don't talk about Bitcoin much here because Bedford's a deprived town, and I don't want people thinking, 'Oh my God, there's that guy who's made some money on Bitcoin. I\u2019m going to buy Bitcoin,\u2019 then they lose their money.\u201d\n\nPeter McCormack shares a joke with Cointelegraph before the game.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin is still 60% lower than its all-time high of 2021, and Bedford, like many U.K. towns, is on the decline. Battered by inflation and economic mismanagement, closing down sales and boarded-up shops overshadow the high street. McCormack explained that it might not be wise to grandstand Bitcoin in such an environment:\n\n\u201cThey [the people of Bedford] can see it, they can come to our [Bitcoin] meetups, but it\u2019s a soft touch. It\u2019s my Trojan horse. It's a Trojan football.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin trojan horse, a meme in the Bitcoin space popularised by Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, explains that Bitcoin adoption delivers freedom as well as wealth. For McCormack, rather than capturing Troy, he could emulate the success of Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador, but in Bedford:\n\nEach Real Bedford home fixture puts on a pre-game Bitcoin meetup. Locals and traveling Bitcoin enthusiasts ask questions and learn more about the decentralized currency, while Real Bedford merch can be bought using the Lightning Network. A show of hands at the last game of the season demonstrated that, for many people, it was their first real-life interaction with Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to communicate Bitcoin to the country. It's a bit like El Zonte was the seed that turned El Salvador into a Bitcoin country. I want this to be the seed that makes our country understand and have better regulations towards Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIt might be an uphill battle. Despite grassroots efforts from Brits at the Bitcoin Collective and the Bitcoin Policy U.K., government ministers are still trying to understand what Bitcoin is and how to regulate crypto.\n\nPeter McCormack behind the clubhouse bar with the trophy. Source: Twitter\n\nUltimately, the Bitcoin party atmosphere over the weekend\u2013champagne showers, dancing with the kit man, and nights out to the wee hours in Bedford\u2013will have to contend with a country committed to adopting CBDCs or central bank digital currencies while a cohort of the U.K. population is unable to afford basic amenities.\n\nUndeterred and committed to the long game, McCormack told Cointelegraph: \u201cI\u2019m going to be here for the rest of my life here in Bedford at every game I can possibly be at trying to lift up my town.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "content": "Macro Markets, hosted by crypto analyst Marcel Pechman, airs every Friday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel and explains complex concepts in layman\u2019s terms, focusing on the cause and effect of traditional financial events on day-to-day crypto activity.\n\nThis week\u2019s show starts by discussing the mutual fund industry, including the well-known BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard, and how the top 15 asset managers handle over $54 trillion. Can you believe it? That money could buy all the companies listed in the S&P 500 Index, plus all the gold, fiat bills and coins in circulation on the planet.\n\nPechman explains how the $120 trillion managed by these mutual funds relies heavily on fixed income and why it remains their top bet despite paying below inflation for the past three years. Moreover, the show discusses how passive investment strategies might catapult Bitcoin (BTC) into a whole other sphere, instantly gaining adoption among institutional investors.\n\nThe next segment of Macro Markets answers a question from \u201cFilm City,\u201d who posed a question in last week\u2019s YouTube video comments. Pechman explains why the 40-year low unemployment rate in the United States is not necessarily bullish for risky investments. On the other hand, the analyst illustrates how an increase in the unemployment rate, especially above 10%, is certainly detrimental to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe show concludes by examining the U.S. credit default swap (CDS) rates, which recently reached an 11-year high. Those insurance instruments activate if the debt issuer fails to honor their payments \u2014 in this case, the U.S. government Treasury. Pechman explains why the U.S. CDS is not worrisome at the moment and how one should analyze specific risks to the U.S. dollar currency.\n\nIf you are looking for exclusive and valuable content provided by leading crypto analysts and experts, make sure to subscribe to the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

        "content": "Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry\u2019s most important developments.\n\nThree Arrows Capital (3AC), a once-bourgeoning Singaporean hedge fund worth an estimated $10 billion at its peak, was utterly obliterated by the bear market last year. However, the carnival it has created since the initial blowup still lives on, and its main characters appear to be doing quite well, too.\n\n\n\nOne of 3AC co-founders, Kyle Davies, appears to have finally found some solace from the experience. After much turmoil, the former hedge fund manager has now transitioned into an aspiring restauranteur fixated on one task \u2014 perfecting the art of cooking chicken.\n\nKyle Davies chopping up \u2026 nothing for some reason. (Twitter)\n\nAny seasoned chef would know that cooking a tender, well-seasoned, juicy and crispy-skinned chicken is a rather exquisite skill. To perfect it, one needs to maintain a razor-sharp focus on the meat while techniques are applied, which requires cutting out distractions \u2014 such as focusing on negative feelings related to creditors trying to claim $3.5 billion from 3AC\u2019s bankruptcy \u2014 during the performance.\n\n\n\nAlso read: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, chefs don\u2019t like customers who are rude. This is why when a user suggested on April 14 to review-bomb Davies\u2019 new Dubai restaurant, the now professional cook immediately threatened legal action against individuals who post \u201cintentionally false reviews and defamation against my restaurant.\u201d\n\nIntentionally false reviews and defamation against my restaurant is illegal. We will prosecute anyone engaging in this behavior. https://t.co/W01wxxI6fY \u2014 Kyle Davies (@KyleLDavies) April 14, 2023\n\nMeanwhile Davies and fellow co-founder Su Zhu launched the OPNX exchange on April 5, launched to trade bankruptcy claims of fallen crypto entities such as FTX and Celsius. Although daily volume was only around $13 initially, by the time of publication, the exchange has reached nearly $1.8 million in daily trading volume.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not pleasant being the one to disappoint the crowd, but these numbers are pretty impressive. Consider the fact that the sum of all regulated crypto products listed in Hong Kong only does about $1.19 million in volume per day.\n\nNot that the exchange is playing up its 3AC ties. In an April 14 interview, OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb reportedly said that \u201cWhile Su Zhu and Kyle contributed much in terms of early-stage ideas and vision, they currently are no longer involved in OPNX\u2019s everyday operations.\u201d\n\nHappy Sunday friends \u2022~\u2022 finally some sunshine in HK today \u2600\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Oce9KLCyJa \u2014 Leslie Lamb (@therealleslamb0) April 16, 2023\n\nIn other 3AC news, on April 19, Sotheby\u2019s auction house announced it would sell a series of NFT collections recovered by liquidators, including Dmitri Cherniak\u2019s artwork \u201cThe Golden Goose,\u201d purchased by Davies and Zhu with $5.8 million in Ether in August 2021.\n\n\n\nZhu appears to have taken the news philosophically, quoting the famed English poet Alfred Tennyson: \u201c[Tis] better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all,\u201d while highlighting the NFT auction for his followers. 3AC\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings are currently ongoing.\n\nIn a post to followers, Su Zhu bids his audience \u201cgood morning\u201d and asks for \u201cgood vibes only.\u201d (Twitter)\n\nSingaporean Bitcoin miner\u2019s wild week\n\nOn April 14, shares of Singaporean Bitcoin (BTC) mining operator SAI.TECH, listed on the Nasdaq exchange, surged by over 360% in one day to a high of $7.42 before giving back much of its gains. The stock is currently trading at $3.68 per share at the time of publication. There was no material news preceding the unusual price action \u2014 and we certainly tried to identify some.\n\n\n\nSAI.TECH develops Bitcoin mining infrastructure hardware, namely Saihub, Tankbox, and Rackbox, that utilizes liquid cooling and waste heat recovery solutions to improve efficiency for miners.\n\nOn April 20, the company consolidated its product lines into three categories; Ultiaas, Boltbit, and Heatnuc. Boltbit will focus on providing decentralized transaction system services and technical support, while Heatnuc focuses on the \u201cresearch and promotion of small modular reactors.\u201d Ultiaas puts the emphasis on hardware and software products that convert mining chip heat to reusable energy.\n\nThe company terminated its Phase II 90 megawatts (MW) crypto mining and hosting expansion plan in Kazakhstan last year following a \u201cforce majeure,\u201d and will continue to execute its Phase I 15 MW agreement for the same purpose. In January 2022, the Kazakh government resigned following protests and shut down access to the internet, disrupting the operations of Bitcoin miners in the country. The company is currently emphasizing operations at its testing and distribution facility in Ohio.\n\nSAI.TECH\u2019s main Bitcoin mining infrastructure products. (SAI.TECH)\n\nBruce Lee NFTs fizzle\u2026\n\nNot even the late Hong Kong film legend could defeat the economic laws of supply and demand with his martial arts dexterity. Between April 12 to April 14, the Bruce Lee Foundation, directed by his daughter Shannon, partnered with NFT video platform Shibuya to launch The House of Lee collection to celebrate the life and work of the namesake Kung Fu legend. A total of 48,691 NFTs were minted at a price of 0.008 Ether (ETH), to 6,452 owners (13% unique).\n\n\n\nThere was one slight issue, only one NFT was unique in the collection, that of the House of Lee Genesis NFT. With an abundance of supply, the floor price of the collection quickly dropped to around 0.003 ETH apiece on OpenSea at the time of publication. The sale still grossed approximately $730,000, minus the cost of placing a mega billboard advertisement for the NFT drop on Broadway.\n\n\n\nStart spreading the news\u20265 hours left to get your ticket to House of Lee.\n\nPress link \u2014> https://t.co/GlB6iylbsd\n\n\n\n*Apple Pay Accepted@shibuyaxyz @pplpleasr1 pic.twitter.com/4HltFEM2fV \u2014 Bruce Lee (@brucelee) April 13, 2023\n\nWhile the initial sale may have been somewhat lukewarm, the NFTs are billed as \u201cYour ticket to the House of Lee,\u201d and there are reports that this is a mere first stage of an ongoing Web3 collaboration. It seems the martial arts legend may continue to fight on in the realm of blockchain after all."

        "content": "EASTON, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TeraWulf Inc. (Nasdaq: WULF) (\u201cTeraWulf\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), owners and operators of vertically integrated, domestic Bitcoin mining facilities powered by more than 91% zero-carbon energy, today announced that the Company has now fully energized its 50-MW stake in the Nautilus Cryptomine facility, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC.\n\nThe Nautilus facility represents the first behind-the-meter Bitcoin mining facility of its kind, directly sourcing reliable, carbon-free, 24x7 baseload power from the 2.5 GW Susquehanna nuclear generation station in Pennsylvania. The Company successfully deployed its full share in phase one of the facility - 50 MW and 1.9 EH/s \u2013 ahead of schedule. TeraWulf has the option to add an additional 50 MW of mining capacity at the Nautilus facility, which the Company plans to deploy in future phases.\n\nWith TeraWulf\u2019s stake in the Nautilus facility now fully ramped to 50 MW, the Company currently has an operating hashrate of 4 EH/s, reflecting a nearly 100% increase year to date. TeraWulf has an operational fleet of approximately 34,500 of the latest generation miners, comprised of 18,500 miners at its wholly owned Lake Mariner facility in New York (5,000 of which are hosted) and 16,000 self-miners at the nuclear-powered Nautilus facility in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cOur team has been working swiftly and diligently to achieve our stated goal of reaching 5.5 EH/s of operational mining capacity in Q2 2023,\u201d said Paul Prager, Chairman and CEO of TeraWulf. \u201cDeploying 50 MW of mining capacity at the Nautilus facility is an important milestone for the Company. Not only does it represent the first nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility in the U.S., but TeraWulf now has the opportunity to realize the economic advantage of 50 MW of zero-carbon mining at what is arguably the lowest contracted power cost in the sector \u2013 just $0.02/kWh for a term of five years,\u201d continued Prager.\n\nIn addition to the 50 MW of self-mining capacity online now at Nautilus, TeraWulf currently has 60 MW operational at Lake Mariner and is in final stages of construction on Building 2, which will increase Lake Mariner\u2019s operational capacity to over 110 MW in the coming weeks. Combined, the Company expects to have a total operational capacity of 50,000 miners (5.5 EH/s) in Q2 2023, representing approximately 160 MW of power demand.\n\nAbout TeraWulf\n\nTeraWulf (Nasdaq: WULF) owns and operates vertically integrated, environmentally clean Bitcoin mining facilities in the United States. Led by an experienced group of energy entrepreneurs, the Company currently has two Bitcoin mining facilities: the wholly owned Lake Mariner facility in New York, and the Nautilus Cryptomine facility in Pennsylvania, a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC. TeraWulf generates domestically produced Bitcoin powered by nuclear, hydro, and solar energy with a goal of utilizing 100% zero-carbon energy. With a core focus on ESG that ties directly to its business success, TeraWulf expects to offer attractive mining economics at an industrial scale.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

        "content": "Robert Kiyosaki, the world-renowned investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book, \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d has once again voiced his support for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a tweet on April 21, he declared his love for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, citing its independence from government and central bank control as one of its primary strengths.\n\nKiyosaki\u2019s tweet reminisces about the time when Bitcoin first hit $20,000 and then subsequently crashed to zero. He initially believed that the digital currency was finished, but over time, he watched as it climbed back up to $6,000. It was then that he decided to invest heavily in Bitcoin because, in his words, \u201cpeople support BC, not FED or Gov.\u201d\n\nKiyosaki is confident that Bitcoin will continue to rise in value, predicting that it will eventually reach $100,000. He believes that the currency\u2019s popularity and adoption will continue to grow as more and more people recognize the benefits of using a decentralized currency that is not subject to the whims of governments or central banks as it does not need to be bailed out by the government or the federal reserve.\n\nWHY I \u2764\ufe0fBITCOIN: Years ago I watched BC climb to $20k then drop to 0. I thought BC finished. Slowly watched BC climb to $6 k & I bought lots. WHY? Because people support BC not FED or Gov. BC did not need FED or Gov bailout because BC people\u2019s money. BC to $100k. Long live BC. \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 21, 2023\n\nKiyosaki on Bitcoin\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of the digital asset, according to the author, is its independence from government or central bank control. Unlike fiat currencies, which governments and central banks can manipulate, Bitcoin\u2019s value is determined solely by the market forces of supply and demand.\n\nThis feature makes the cryptocurrency a popular investment option for people who are concerned about the traditional financial system\u2019s instability and volatility.\n\nKiyosaki also had harsh words for the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and President Biden, whom he accused this week of lying about the state of the US economy. In his opinion, the US is on the verge of a financial collapse, and investors should be looking for alternative investments like Bitcoin to protect their wealth.\n\nHe also predicted a massive backlash for the US dollar, stating that it is no longer the world\u2019s reserve currency. He believes that the US is no longer the \u2018playground bully\u2018 and that other countries, particularly China and Russia, are working to undermine the dollar\u2019s dominance."

        "content": "The following is a guest post by Cath Schwartz.\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrency is undeniable. Despite its volatile market, we\u2019ve recently seen wide adoption of this digital currency. Many would say that crypto is the future of money.\n\nThe global crypto population increased by a whopping 178% in 2021. It has grown from 106 million in January to 295 million in December of last year. Here\u2019s the catch: the number of crypto owners might hit one billion by the end of this year.\n\nDoes this mean that the e-commerce industry is already using crypto? The answer is yes.\n\nThis page is a practical guide to e-commerce cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nSimply put, cryptocurrency is a form of virtual currency. This digital asset gets distributed across a large number of computers. However, people cannot counterfeit it due to cryptography.\n\nAs an encrypted digital payment, crypto can be used and exchanged among users. That\u2019s where e-commerce cryptocurrency comes in.\n\nHow crypto works\n\nCryptocurrency works on a decentralized network using blockchain technology. What does this mean? Consider two things:\n\nDecentralization: cryptocurrency is decentralized since no central authority issues and controls it. It means governments cannot regulate this virtual currency and interfere with its transactions.\n\nBlockchain: This technology entails a distributed ledger in a different network of computers. It essentially has a set of connected blocks. Each contains a series of transactions verified by each network member.\n\nIn addition, understand that cryptocurrencies can either be:\n\nMined: Cryptocurrency mining entails verifying transactions and recording these on digital ledgers.\n\nPurchased: You can buy and sell crypto from exchanges that work like a broker.\n\nCommon cryptocurrencies in the market\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the most common cryptocurrencies today:\n\nBitcoin (BTC): It\u2019s the original and most popular cryptocurrency worldwide. It was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. It has led to the inception of other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum (ETH): The second most popular cryptocurrency globally. Ethereum, a blockchain-based software platform, was developed in 2015 with its own crypto, ETH. Unlike BTC, it\u2019s both a platform and a cryptocurrency.\n\nLitecoin: It\u2019s also one of the pioneers in the crypto market. Launched in 2011, it followed the footsteps of BTC as the \u2018lite\u2019 version. But unlike BTC, it can produce its coins at scale.\n\nWhat is e-commerce cryptocurrency?\n\nBy definition, e-commerce cryptocurrency is a digital currency used for online business transactions. This means consumers use crypto like bitcoin to pay for goods or items purchased from online stores. Yes, cryptocurrency has already penetrated the e-commerce industry.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve seen the gradual adoption of cryptocurrency in e-commerce. Online businesses have started accepting digital currencies as a form of payment. Cryptocurrency offers e-commerce merchants some benefits, from ease to convenience to security. However, there is more to these advantages than meets the eye.\n\nLearn more about e-commerce cryptocurrency in the next section.\n\nCryptocurrency for consumer payments\n\nHere\u2019s how consumers can use crypto for e-commerce transactions:\n\nPayments via personal wallets: E-commerce businesses accept crypto directly without any intermediaries. They allow consumers to have digital wallets with virtual assets in them. Then, consumers can use their crypto money to purchase products online.\n\nPayments via third parties: Online businesses use third-party services (BitPay and Coinbase) for crypto transactions. Consumers use their crypto money to buy products through these payment gateways.\n\nCompanies using e-commerce crypto:\n\nBelow are some companies that have started using e-commerce cryptocurrencies:\n\nStarbucks employs Bakkt, allowing its members to convert crypto into cash using their SB cards.\n\nMicrosoft accepts bitcoin payments for purchasing Windows games, movies, and app licenses.\n\nLush accepts bitcoin payments for online purchases, given its partnership with Bitpay.com.\n\nPotential benefits and drawbacks of e-commerce cryptocurrency\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the potential benefits and drawbacks of using e-commerce crypto. To weigh the pros and cons, consider the following:\n\nPros:\n\nMarket Growth: Individuals and businesses can no longer ignore crypto\u2019s market growth. E-commerce businesses should capitalize on crypto\u2019s expansion as early as now. Who knows? It might be the future money.\n\nFast Transactions: E-commerce crypto transactions go through and get immediately posted. E-commerce merchants don\u2019t need to wait for bank processing. They don\u2019t need to seek approval from a central authority. That can provide you with an immediate return on investment (ROI).\n\nZero-to-minimal Fees: Payments via digital wallets don\u2019t incur a transaction fee. But if it\u2019s payment via a third party, there will be a minimal charge. Consumers will spend less when using e-commerce crypto for purchasing.\n\nImproved UX: Offering consumers crypto as a payment option improves the user experience. Such payment flexibility will reduce your cart abandonment rate. It will go as far as increasing your sales conversion.\n\nEnhanced Security: Cryptocurrency is encrypted, operating in blockchain technology. For this reason, consumers can expect full security. Their digital assets cannot get counterfeited at all.\n\nCons:\n\nVolatile Pricing: Cryptocurrency is negatively known for its volatility. Its market value is unpredictable and can significantly go up and down. Why is this so? No official fiat currency backs crypto.\n\nCash Flow Problems: The public doesn\u2019t fully recognize cryptocurrency as having real value. E-commerce merchants accepting crypto as consumer payments may keep them as digital assets, which can make up your free cash flow. However, the problem starts when they need to use the money for business expenditures almost immediately.\n\nTrust Issues: The global media puts crypto, albeit its market growth, in a negative light. That\u2019s why e-commerce merchants are hesitant to allow this payment method. And so are the consumers, who are wary of using this digital currency.\n\nSustainability Issues: Cryptocurrency mining requires massive energy for mining crypto coins. Per CNBC, the energy use for crypto mining is so high. It consumes more electricity than the Netherlands\u2019 yearly consumption. Thus, this has negative repercussions on the global quest for sustainability.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe use of cryptocurrency has become increasingly popular worldwide, which applies to the e-commerce industry.\n\nAs an online business owner, consider offering crypto as one of your payment options. But as a consumer, consider using this virtual currency for your online purchase. However, understand what it is and how it works. More importantly, weigh the pros and cons discussed above.\n\nWith these in mind, you\u2019ll have an informed decision. Capitalize on e-commerce cryptocurrency. It might be the future of money."

Macroeconomic data is likely to remain a key trigger for the markets.\n\n\n\nBitcoin dropped as much as 5 per cent to slip sharply below the $29,000 mark in the last 24 hours. Its largest peer, Ethereum, dropped more than 7 per cent and breached below the $1,950 level. Pain in the altcoins, however, was severe.\n\n\n\nBitcoin experienced a decline to below the $29,000 level following the release of UK inflation figures that exceeded expectations, indicating a 10.1 per cent increase in the 12-month period. This drop led BTC to its lowest point since April 10, with the next significant support level at $28,500, said Edul Patel, CEO and Co-Founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Ethereum saw a 7 per cent decrease over the same period, trading at the $1,900 level. The market responds with a typical reaction to unexpected events, prompting investors to move away from riskier assets. So, it might take some time for investors and traders to assess the potential impact of the inflation data and recover from the incident,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAll of the top crypto tokens were trading with big cuts on Thursday. Even the stablecoins were trading in red. Litecoin plunged 11 per cent, whereas Avalanche tanked 10 per cent. Solana was down 8 per cent, while Polygon and Polkadot tumbled 7 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading steeply lower, around $1.21 trillion, dropping more than 5 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes soared about 40 per cent to $63.51 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View from WazirX Trade Desk\n\nBeta Finance(BETA) is a decentralized financial platform built on Ethereum that enables users to borrow, lend, and short various crypto assets without requiring permission. It offers a convenient and scalable money market that automatically and freely lists tokens, allowing users to short them as well.\n\nBETA had been on a steady decline since August last year. On the daily timeframe the chart has broken above the descending trendline. We could expect the momentum to continue for a few more days. The next resistance is expected at $0.115 and the next support is expected at $0.065 levels"

        "title": "Will Crypto Recover? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies suffered tremendously in 2022. Scandals and bankruptcies rattled several large and popular names in the space, against a backdrop of raging inflation and painful anti-inflation policies. From market-darling growth stocks to overpriced real estate properties, anything risky took a massive price cut.\n\nOf course, cryptocurrencies led that race to the bottom, and many investors lost their enthusiasm for the crypto sector after price cuts like these:\n\nCryptocurrency Price 12/31/2021 Price 12/31/2022 Change Bitcoin (BTC -0.12%) $47,192 $16,604 (65%) Ethereum (ETH -1.02%) $3,715 $1,199 (68%) XRP (XRP -1.65%) $1.36 $0.35 (59%) Cardano (ADA -1.95%) $0.84 $0.25 (82%)\n\nWas that the beginning of the end for crypto investments? Did the crypto bubble pop once and for all last year? Or should you expect at least some of these plunging coins to make another comeback?\n\nHere's what I think about these burning questions. Let's see if you agree or not.\n\nHistorical perspective\n\nLet's rewind to 2013. Bitcoin was the only name in the game back then, but that was more than enough fuel for some head-turning market action. The token was worth less than $13 per coin when it performed its first \"halving\" in November 2012. That's a preordained 50% cut in the rewards earned for mining a new Bitcoin block, scheduled to occur roughly every four years. The inflation-killing event inspired more people to try their hand at Bitcoin mining and the token soon soared.\n\nBitcoin prices rose to $130 by August 2012 and then peaked at $1,151 in December. That's when a leading cryptocurrency exchange was hacked, popping that bubble with authority. Bitcoin retreated to roughly $180 per coin amid loud proclamations that the whole cryptocurrency concept was just a mirage with no real value. We Fools poked fun at the fledgling crypto market with the fictional FoolCoin launch on April 1, 2014. Har de har har.\n\nAnother surge, peak, and crash followed in 2017, about one year after the next halving. This time, Bitcoin's moves led the pricing action in thousands of newer cryptocurrencies, including all the names listed in the table above. The trading volumes were also much higher and the price moves saw more coverage in traditional news outlets. Bitcoin prices nearly reached $20,000 per coin this time. Yet, another crypto winter followed and plenty of investors swore off cryptocurrencies forever. The old joke just wasn't funny anymore, right?\n\nThe next halving during the COVID-19 lockdowns in May 2020 didn't seem to do much at first, as Bitcoin prices held firm for several months at roughly $10,000. Still, another bull run followed in 2021 and Bitcoin prices soared above $60,000 a couple of times. Some of the same people who had given up on crypto in 2018 took this market seriously again. Non-fungible tokens were red-hot for a while. Some store chains started accepting payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even Dogecoin (DOGE 8.56%).\n\nAnd then, you know, the inflation-inspired retreat from risky investments followed. The eternal death of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Cardano was announced from the rooftops. This is different somehow. This really is the end. There's no coming back from the devastating price cuts you saw in that handy little data table.\n\nRight?\n\nDon't call it a comeback (crypto has been here for years)\n\nWell, the rumors of crypto's death have been exaggerated many times before and I expect another full recovery. You see, these nifty digital currencies have game-changing implications for every corner of the financial world. The market is off to a good start in 2023, too.\n\nThe government seems to have tamed the inflation beast at long last. The economy may go through a recession this year but should come out stronger on the other side. Investors are interested in riskier growth-oriented ideas again, including cryptocurrencies. The four digital currencies listed above are up by at least 43% year to date, led by Bitcoin's 73% upward charge.\n\nAnd there are several additional growth catalysts in the cards right now:\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is about one year away. The exact date depends on how quickly people and companies are earning their Bitcoin-mining rewards, but the last block at the current rewards rate should fall near the end of April 2024. You've seen what usually happens a few months later. History doesn't repeat itself but it does tend to rhyme. This cyclical pattern alone seems almost certain to spark a fresh bull run next year.\n\nRegulators and crypto projects are hammering out a future framework for crypto regulation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against XRP's managing body, Ripple Labs, is awaiting a judgment after more than three years of claims, filings, and high-profile media sparring. When that gavel bangs, it should bring some much-needed clarity to how the SEC and other government agencies should treat the crypto market as a whole. Even a draconian ruling in the SEC's favor would be better than the rudderless boat crypto investors have been stuck with so far.\n\nThe inflation crisis gave a lot of people the idea that traditional financial systems may not be perfect after all. Cryptocurrencies could have the power to right many of the old-school banking market's wrongs, for example. Just a couple of usable and widely adopted decentralized finance (DeFi) apps would light a fire under whichever blockchain network powered the new app. Even a smaller hit could do the trick for a modestly sized crypto like Cardano, while Ethereum's needle is harder to move.\n\nBitcoin's predictable halving events may set the rhythm of the crypto market, but in the long run I'm much more interested in robust regulations and mass-market adoption of DeFi apps. That's where the crypto market's real value springs from. Without developers and app users, cryptocurrencies don't mean a thing.\n\nSo there is no doubt in my mind that cryptocurrencies will soar again. The timing and magnitude of the next rise is up for discussion, though. Again, look for successful DeFi apps and invest in the cryptocurrencies that make them tick. Ideally, you already own some before the rocket launch starts without much advance notice."

The car manufacturer\u2019s accounting sheets showed that the company did not make any changes in its Bitcoin [BTC] holdings.\n\nThis was in comparison to the last Q4 report of 2022.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nTesla\u2019s Bitcoin Bet\n\nThis aforementioned statement proved that Tesla neither bought more coins nor sold existing ones. Notably, this is the third consecutive quarter the firm held the same stance on its BTC holdings.\n\nThe car manufacturer initially entered the crypto market in February 2021. The firm purchased BTC worth $1.2 billion but sold 75% of this investment in July 2022. Moreover, the sale took place right when the king coin had started losing its value. Notably, the sale added around $936 million to the firm\u2019s accounting books in cash reserves.\n\nThe electric vehicle manufacturer held around 11,950 BTC at press time, which was worth over $349 million. Interestingly, Tesla\u2019s report also showed that the value of held BTC remained the same as the previous quarter. The e-car manufacturer\u2019s Q4 2022 report placed its BTC asset value at $184 million. This same number was projected for this quarter as well despite a surge in the coin\u2019s price.\n\nFurthermore, BTC\u2019s price reached a high of $23,954 in January 2023, while it reached a peak of $29,380 in the month of March 2023. Tesla did not increase its BTC valuation because of accounting rules. The electric vehicle manufacturer classifies its BTC holdings as an intangible assets-goodwill. This means that the company will register quarterly impairment analysis for losses but the gains will be registered only if it is sold.\n\nNotably, Tesla had a more pro-Bitcoin stance before the 2022 bear market. The company, spearheaded by Elon Musk, was set to add BTC as an option for payments for purchases. However, the plan was aborted with Musk citing environmental concerns surrounding the mining of the largest digital currency in the market.\n\nSubsequently, he also claimed that BTC was not \u201ca good substitute for transactional currency,\u201d while voicing support for Dogecoin [DOGE]."

        "content": "Bitcoin price in India and international markets dropped on Friday, after days of seeing its value rise. Industry experts say that at present, the selling pressure on investors has increased, triggering a period of volatility for crypto assets. On Friday, the world's most popular cryptocurrency opened with a loss of 2.22 percent to trade at $28,245 (roughly Rs. 23.2 lakh). While it remains the most expensive cryptocurrency, BTC is currently trading at a similar price on both national as well as international exchanges. In the last 24 hours, the value of Bitcoin has dropped by $613 (roughly Rs. 50,370).\n\n\u201cBitcoin dropped for the second consecutive session due to an increased selling pressure,\u201d Edul Patel, CEO of crypto investment platform Mudrex told Gadgets 360. Selling pressure garners heat when majority of the traders begin selling, indicating that the majority is betting on the market price to decrease. \u201cThis resulted in the loss of the rally and wiped out the weekly gains of Bitcoin. Despite this, there is still substantial support down to the late-March lows of $26,500 (roughly Rs. 21 lakh) and Bitcoin has seen a 40 percent increase over the past six weeks.\u201d\n\nEthereum followed Bitcoin in a conventional market movement and reflected a loss of 0.10 percent at the time of publishing. The value of Ether is hovering around the mark of $1,940 (roughly Rs. 1.60 lakh) after having fallen by $157 (roughly Rs. 12,899) in the last three days.\n\nOn Friday, most cryptocurrencies saw their prices fall alongside Bitcoin and Ether. These included altcoins like Tether, Binance Coin, USD Coin, Ripple, and Cardano as well as Dogecoin, Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot.\n\nShiba Inu, Avalanche, and Tron also saw their values drop on Friday.\n\n\u201cMarket performance has been sideways with a downward bias in the last 24 hours. The two-day continuous drop could be triggered by a $400 million (roughly Rs. 3,268 crore) sell order on Binance. On the regulatory front, the US seems to be lagging as market liquidity seems to be moving away from the country. Greed seems to be on a decline, as the crypto fear and greed index stands at 50, down two points in the last 24 hours and lowest since March 15,\u201d Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch told Gadgets 360.\n\nThe overall crypto market valuation dipped by 1.45 percent over the last 24 hours. As of Friday, the crypto market cap stood at $1.20 trillion (roughly Rs. 98,26,980 crore), showed the data by CoinMarketCap. In the otherwise top-to-bottom loss-ridden price chart, LEO and Bitcoin SV managed to record miniscule price hikes.\n\nWhile there are several factors that could have led to the crypto market hitting a speed breaker after rallying for days, it could also be due to the possibility of stricter oversight that could make it risky for miscreants to engage with the sector. The European Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly backed the European Union's (EU) first set of rules to regulate the cryptoasset markets.\n\nCalled MiCA \u2014 or Markets in Crypto Assets \u2014 these rules largely revolve around consumer protection and prevention of market manipulation and financial crimes in the crypto sector. The MiCA bill is aimed at preventing insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and market manipulation of crypto-assets.\n\n\u201cThe crypto market faces headwinds, but long-term tailwinds for Bitcoin are highlighted in 3iQ's 2023 Outlook. Key market indicators showed a \u2018Sell' sentiment amidst prices of BTC and ETH decreasing after a good run in the past few days.

An Indian business tycoon, Mahindra runs one of India's largest automotive manufacturing corporation that boasts a valuation of $18.3 billion (roughly Rs. 1,50,353 crore).\n\nMahindra, 67, is an avid Twitter user and often updates his timeline with amusing videos, social commentary, and his personal experiences with life.\n\nReplying to a follower who asked if a Mahindra car could be purchased via Bitcoin payment, the company chief said, \u201cNot yet.

But maybe bit by bit in the future.. https://t.co/pQS0ZQ52Qf \u2014 anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) April 20, 2023\n\nUp until now, no automobile brand accepts payments in cryptocurrencies in India.\n\nThe government of India is currently working to create a legal framework around crypto activities, in order to mitigate financial and national security risks that the sector could usher in along with its expansion.\n\nCapable of processing instant cross border transfers of hefty payments, cryptocurrencies are unregulated and keep transactions largely untraceable. The misuse of crypto assets by miscreants could increase cases of money laundering and terror financing among others.\n\nWhile the purchase and trading of cryptocurrencies is permitted and taxable in India, no cryptocurrency is used as a payment option alongside the INR currency.\n\nFor Mahindra, however, hinting at taking an experimentative approach towards crypto payments does not come as quite the surprise.\n\nIn March 2022, Mahindra and Mahindra marked its entry into the non-fungible token (NFT) space with the release of its first set of digital collectables, joining the likes of MG Motor India in the automotive space.\n\nWhile Indian automakers are keeping a restrictive approach towards crypto, payments in cryptocurrencies have become part of the financial systems of other nations like El Salvador and the US.\n\nIn the first five months of 2021, Elon Musk's Tesla was actually allowing Bitcoin payments for select products and services.

With the recent rise in the popularity of presale platforms, it\u2019s important to stay up to date on market trends. In this article, we\u2019ll closely analyze the April 2023 forecast for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the new presale coin Dogetti (DETI) and explore the key factors shaping the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin Climbing Back Bit By Bit\n\nBitcoin (BTC), as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has been a strong performer so far in 2023, with prices up 68.4% year-to-date. There are several factors that contribute to this, including increased institutional adoption and a shift in Federal Reserve policy, which has helped to boost investor confidence in the digital currency.\n\nLooking at the positive price performance in March, we can see the potential for a bullish pattern to continue in April. Bitcoin reached $29,000 briefly in late March, but dipped back down to $28,477 at the end of the month, still clocking in a 19.2% monthly gain.\n\nEthereal Economics: The Rising Value of Ethereum\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has also seen gains in 2023, with prices up 49.2% year-to-date. One key factor driving this growth is the rise of Web3, the next generation of the internet, using decentralisation as a key part of the network. Web3 has the potential to revolutionise the way we use the internet, and Ethereum\u2019s position as a key player in this space makes it an attractive investment opportunity for those interested in the future of digital technology.\n\nEthereum also is looking to perform strongly in April, as Ethereum shot up by 9.7% over the month of March, and finished strongly at a price of $1829.\n\nDogetti: The Rise of a New Meme Coin Kingpin\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a new presale coin that is set to launch in just two months and is attracting a lot of attention from many cryptocurrency investors. The coin\u2019s purpose is to create a strong community where holders are regularly rewarded thanks to a 2% reflection protocol, which means that 2% of every transaction is distributed to all wallets.\n\nDogetti also has a unique feature in the form of DogettiSwap, a decentralised exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain where users can trade ERC20 tokens with a 6% tax fee, which is broken down into 2% redistributed to all wallets, 2% to a charity wallet, and 2% for liquidity.\n\nPredicting the future price of any asset is a daunting task, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. Bitcoin and Ethereum have all experienced significant price fluctuations in the past. These digital assets have proven their potential to disrupt traditional finance and create new opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nOverall, the April 2023 cryptocurrency market forecast looks promising for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogetti, with each offering unique opportunities for investors.\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Israel's Central Bank Launches Digital Currency; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Signuptoken.com Can Capitalize - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In recent years, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have gained significant attention as widely used digital currencies. However, alongside these established players, newer cryptocurrencies like Signuptoken.com (SUT) have also emerged as potential contenders in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nAmidst this changing payment landscape, Israel\u2019s Central Bank is reportedly considering the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which refers to a digital form of fiat currency issued and regulated by a country\u2019s central bank.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Digital Shekel Or SHAKED?\n\nThe Steering Committee on the Potential Issuance of a Digital Shekel, or \u201cSHAKED,\u201d is in charge of the Bank of Israel\u2019s investigation into the feasibility of releasing a digital shekel. They have identified a number of scenarios that could influence the creation and use of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), including things like CBDC issuances by other nations, a decline in the use of cash in transactions, the adoption of stablecoins or other private payment methods, competition within the domestic payment system, and technological developments in the payments industry.\n\nThe Bank of Israel acknowledges the necessity to proactively address these issues and maintain control over the nation\u2019s payment system as the landscape of digital currencies continues to change. As a viable means of navigating these adjustments and ensuring that Israel stays at the forefront of financial innovation, CBDC is being taken into consideration. Although negotiations over the creation of \u201cSHAKED\u201d are ongoing, no official decision has been made.\n\nWhy Does Signuptoken.com Gain Attention\n\nSignuptoken.com (SUT) has unveiled groundbreaking features poised to revolutionize the crypto world, positioning it as a valuable asset comparable to gold.\n\nSUT, an ERC-20-based cryptocurrency, is committed to generating financial growth for its members. Despite being a relatively new player in the crypto space, Signuptoken.com has ambitious plans to launch on the Uniswap blockchain once it reaches one million sign-ups.\n\nWhat sets Signuptoken.com apart from other altcoins is its unique approach to fundraising. Unlike traditional initial coin offerings (ICOs) or presale programs, Signuptoken.com only collects email addresses, ensuring equal opportunity for all to increase their financial assets. By joining the exclusive Millionaires Club email list, members may even become eligible for early retirement.\n\nPoised to be a safe asset, Signuptoken.com (SUT) has responded to the clamor from its esteemed Millionaires Club members by introducing a highly anticipated referral system. Also, SUT ensures the security of its funds by taking measures to instill confidence in its platform. It acquired audits and secured listings on established crypto platforms such as CoinSniper and Solidity Finance.\n\nBitcoin And Ether \u2014 Likened To Gold\n\nAccording to CoinTelegraph, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether are similar to safe-haven investments like gold in that they offer stability during macroeconomic turbulence. She cites their endurance over the most recent banking crisis, outperforming other asset classes, as proof of their widespread acceptance and adoption, pointing to a potential upheaval of the established order of things.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies gain popularity and come under regulatory pressure from the US government, Wood anticipates that they will play a significant role in the upcoming election. But only some people are as enthusiastic about this idea as she is. The world\u2019s largest hedge fund\u2019s founder, Ray Dalio, is skeptical of Bitcoin due to its volatility and central banks\u2019 unwillingness to accept it as a legitimate form of payment. After the US dollar and the euro, gold continues to be a substantial reserve held by central banks, according to Dalio.\n\nThe emergence of cryptocurrencies and the growing interest in CBDC by Israel\u2019s Central Bank reflect the changing landscape of digital assets. With \u201cgold\u201d cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SUT establishing their existence in the crypto world and CBDC being considered a potential digital currency by central banks, the future of payments and financial systems is likely to be shaped by the continued evolution of digital assets.\n\nProvide Your Email on the Signuptoken.com Roster\n\nWebsite: https://www.signuptoken.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SignUpToken_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/SignUpToken\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin was working to print a bearish Marubozu candlestick.\n\nThe move lower was coming on lower-than-average volume, which indicates a reversal to the upside may be in the cards over the next few days.

However, this could potentially lead to large pullback risks, according to McGlone.\n\nMcGlone tweeted: \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 may be running into a wall of resistance at the key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000. Our bias is bullish in the long term for the top cryptos, but an overwhelming force of the stock market going down with the Fed tightening into a recession has the potential to lower the tide for all risk assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the riskiest.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are among high-risk assets. Source: Mike McGlone\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and Ethereum is closely tied to technological advancements and increasing adoption. Many experts believe that these cryptocurrencies will continue to gain mainstream acceptance as more businesses and individuals recognize the benefits of decentralized financial systems.\n\nSince the turn of the year, Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase of approximately 70%, while Ethereum has climbed just above 60%. Interestingly, a recent historical pattern has emerged as the value of Bitcoin has again reached 15 ETH after six years.\n\nDespite the impressive performance of these digital assets and surpassing key price levels of $30,000 and $2,000 in April, both have experienced significant pullbacks in the last week. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $28,077, down 1.88% on the day and 8.91% over the previous week. Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second-largest asset by market cap, is currently trading at $1,908, down 1.75% in the last 24 hours and 9.86% in the last week.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s recent pullbacks may cause temporary concern, their overall upward trend and potential for long-term growth remain. Investors should remain vigilant of potential downside risks, especially in light of broader market conditions.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

It is noteworthy, however, that the Wallet bot and its associated services, which allow for these functions, were created by a third-party, as opposed to being developed by Telegram itself.\n\nIn fact, the Wallet bot and such similar services are created by third-party developers using Telegram\u2019s open bot API. This means that anyone can utilize the API to develop their own crypto-related bot, without any direct involvement from Telegram.\n\nThus, users of the @wallet web interface can now access buy, withdraw, exchange, and make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions directly through Telegram\u2019s web interface in Bitcoin, as per the latest announcement from the @wallet account on April 21. This move builds upon the existing services surrounding cryptocurrencies that are already popular within the chat program. Notably, the announcement states:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is now available on the @wallet web interface, along with a new instant exchange. You can now buy, withdraw, exchange, and make P2P transactions with BTC directly through our updated web interface. It is now possible to buy Bitcoin using a bank card or the P2P market in the \u201cBuy & Sell\u201d section of our user-friendly interface.\u201d\n\nThe announcement also reminded users that the updated \u201cExchange\u201d of the platform can now instantly swap Bitcoin, Tether (USDT), and Telegram Open Network (TON) with each other.\n\nAs the popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies continue to grow, it will be interesting to see how Telegram and other third-party industry players continue to innovate and adapt to meet the changing needs and expectations of users around the world."

        "content": "There are over 140,000 wallet addresses containing between 10 and 100 BTC, according to the \u201cBitcoin Rich List\u201d. However, not each of these portfolios will belong to a millionaire. There are roughly 24,233 wallets worth more than $1 million among people who are unquestionably Bitcoin millionaires. Not including Satoshi, four Bitcoin addresses contain more than 100,000 Bitcoin each. The four addresses with the most Bitcoin belong to Binance, Bitfinex, and another address, whose identity is unknown. These four addresses collectively own more than 663,000 bitcoin.\n\nDid you also know that Microstrategy owns more Bitcoin than any other publicly traded company. But here\u2019s the thing about decentralization of the blockchain, ownership of Bitcoin, even in large quantities, does not confer any control over the Bitcoin network. How about the Bitcoin whales then? Satoshi Nakamoto is the first Bitcoin whale, inventing and also kickstarting Bitcoin, by being the first miner to create blocks of transactions. It is estimated that Satoshi mined more than 22,000 blocks starting from January 3rd 2009, and received more than one million bitcoin in cumulative block rewards for his work.\n\nThe mystery of who is Satoshi Nakamoto remains to this day and so many other speculations tend to make the Bitcoin space murky. Here\u2019s the thing though, since its introduction almost 13 years ago, Bitcoin has been made available to millions of wallets worldwide. Governments, private organizations, public companies, and even individuals possess these Bitcoin wallets. A select subset of these individuals stands out because of their significant Bitcoin holdings, so let\u2019s start unraveling the mystery.\n\nDefinition of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates independently of central banks or financial institutions. It is created through a process called mining, where a network of computers solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new coins. Bitcoin\u2019s value is determined by market demand and supply and is subject to extreme volatility.\n\nAs of April 2023, the total value of all Bitcoins in circulation is over $1 trillion, making it one of the most valuable assets in the world. Due to its decentralized nature, it is difficult to determine who owns the most Bitcoin, but there are some notable individuals, companies, and private entities that are known to hold significant amounts. This article explores the ownership of the most Bitcoin by private individuals, companies, and private entities.\n\nImportance of knowing who owns the most Bitcoin\n\nThe amount of bitcoin that each stratum of addresses owns in relation to the entire bitcoin supply fluctuates over time. Today, only four Bitcoin addresses contain 100,000 \u2013 1,000,000 BTC for a total of 663,306 BTC. The next 112 largest owners, who range from 10,000 \u2013 100,000 BTC, own a total of 2,378,961 BTC. These wealthiest 112 addresses account for 12.32% of the total supply. Bitcoin addresses with 10,000 or more Bitcoin are sometimes referred to as whales. Here\u2019s an overview of what\u2019s happening in the Bitcoin amassing realm:\n\nSource: River Financial\n\nUnderstanding who owns the most Bitcoin is important for understanding the cryptocurrency market, predicting market movements, and informing regulatory decisions although there are several definite reasons to know who owns the most Bitcoin.\n\nFirst, it can provide insight into the distribution of wealth within the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin was created with the intention of being a decentralized currency, but the ownership of most Bitcoin by a select few individuals, companies, or entities may challenge this ideal. Understanding the distribution of Bitcoin ownership can help to determine if the cryptocurrency market is fair and equitable.\n\nSecond, the ownership of most Bitcoin can have a significant impact on the market. If a large holder of Bitcoin sells their holdings, it can cause a significant shift in the price of Bitcoin. Therefore, knowing who owns the most Bitcoin can provide a sign of potential market volatility and the direction of the market.\n\nThird, the ownership of Bitcoin can also have implications for the regulatory environment. If a small group of individuals or entities owns a significant portion of Bitcoin, it could lead to concerns about market manipulation and the need for increased regulation. On the other hand, if Bitcoin ownership is well-distributed, it may provide a more favorable regulatory environment for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIndividuals who own most Bitcoin\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown, but it is believed to be an individual or group of individuals who developed the original Bitcoin white paper in 2008. The enigmatic inventor of Bitcoin mined more than 22,000 blocks before disappearing from view in 2011. With an estimated 1 million coins spread across around 22,000 wallets, he is said to be the biggest Bitcoin holder in existence right now.\n\nIt is estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto holds around 1 million Bitcoins, which is worth over $40 billion at current prices. While Satoshi Nakamoto has not moved any Bitcoins since 2011, the ownership of such a significant amount of Bitcoin makes them one of the most influential individuals in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIf ever cashed out, the value of these holdings would be tremendous and might cause havoc on the world currency markets. This makes Satoshi, a true inventor with a hefty legacy, one of the most significant yet little-known personalities in finance today.\n\nWinklevoss twins\n\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss are well-known Bitcoin investors and entrepreneurs. They gained fame for their involvement in the early development of Facebook. As a result, they established Gemini 2014, a cryptocurrency exchange. With an estimated 70,000 BTC in their possession, it is thought that this dynamic duo will be among the first to be recognized by Forbes as blockchain and cryptocurrency millionaires.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins are well knowledgeable about the tech industry. The Winklevoss twins are estimated to hold around 1.5% of all Bitcoins in circulation, which is worth over $1.9 billion at current prices. Their involvement in the cryptocurrency market has helped to raise its profile and bring it to mainstream attention.\n\nTim Draper\n\nA well-known venture investor who used Bitcoin early on is Tim Draper. In 2012, he made his first Bitcoin purchase, and since then, he has established himself as a leading figure in the sector. But in 2014, the U.S. Marshals Service staged an auction and sold off a sizable amount of Bitcoins\u2014roughly 30,000 BTC\u2014resulting in his largest buy to date.\n\nDraper acted quickly to seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance, purchasing the coins for just a little bit more than $18 million USD at the time. He has since made some impressive investments as a supporter of blockchain technology, and several fresh and intriguing ventures are currently in development.\n\nMichael J. Saylor\n\nA well-known Bitcoin maximalist, Michael J. Saylor is the co-founder and CEO of the publicly traded software company MicroStrategy. By investing millions of dollars in Bitcoin since 2019, Saylor has placed a significant wager on the cryptocurrency as an asset of the future. His claimed ownership of 17,700 BTC is an astounding demonstration of his faith in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBesides making significant personal investments in Bitcoin, Saylor frequently tweets and speaks in public about it, giving investment counsel to many in the sector. He has been a strong advocate for cryptocurrency investment at larger institutions thanks to his considerable Bitcoin holdings.\n\nBarry Silbert\n\nBarry Silbert is the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, a venture capital firm that invests in blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. He is also the founder of Grayscale investments, which manages the GrayScale Bitcoin Trust, a publicly traded Bitcoin investment fund.\n\nIt is estimated that Barry Silbert holds around 100,000 Bitcoins, which is worth over $2.8 billion at current prices. His influence in the cryptocurrency market through his various ventures has helped to shape the direction of the industry.\n\nPublic corporations with the largest Bitcoin holdings\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nThe publicly traded software company MicroStrategy has recently made news for its decision to invest a sizable chunk of its treasury in Bitcoin. They are currently the largest Bitcoin holders by a wide margin, with holdings totaling over 129,000 BTC. They just made their first Bitcoin buy in 2020, but since then, they have progressively increased their holdings, demonstrating a showed dedication to this emerging asset class.\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings is a financial services company focused on the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries. The company was founded by Mike Novogratz, a well-known cryptocurrency investor, and former hedge fund manager. As of March 2021, Galaxy Digital Holdings held over 16,400 BTC.\n\nMarathon Holdings\n\nThe American Bitcoin mining business, Marathon Digital Holdings, is leading the way in the sector. It presently holds a little over 11,000 BTC, making it the second-largest Bitcoin holder among publicly traded corporations. This amount has increased significantly over the previous year, demonstrating the company\u2019s dedication to seizing new cryptocurrency opportunities as they present themselves.\n\nTesla\n\nIn February 2021, Tesla Inc. shocked the world by announcing that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The move sparked a lot of excitement in the cryptocurrency community, but things really heated up when Tesla announced in 2022 that it was selling 75% of its Bitcoin holdings during the height of the bad market in cryptocurrencies, making a very successful deal. As of right now, Tesla still has 10,500 BTC in their collection of digital assets.\n\nSquare. Inc/Block\n\nA major player in the cryptocurrency industry is Square. The publicly traded company, well recognized for its well-liked payment processing tool, Cash tool, is also one of the biggest Bitcoin (BTC) holders at the moment. In Square, there are over 8,000 BTC. Block has advanced significantly in the Bitcoin industry after changing its name from Square.\n\nPrivate companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings\n\nBinance\n\nBinance owns the largest cold storage wallet address, 34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo, which holds \u200b\u200b248,597 BTC. Changpeng Zhao, who goes by CZ, is the founder and CEO of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In theory, as the dollar\u2019s value decreases with inflation and Bitcoin continues to store value, paying off fiat debt will require fewer bitcoin. This strategy is like buying on margin or using leverage.\n\nGrayscale Investments\n\nGrayscale is a cryptocurrency investment firm that offers a range of investment products, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The company is estimated to hold over 650,000 BTC on behalf of its clients. Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust is one of the most popular ways for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through traditional investment vehicles.\n\nBlock.one\n\nBlock.one is a blockchain software company that is best known for creating the EOS blockchain protocol. The company has also been actively investing in cryptocurrencies and is estimated to hold over 140,000 BTC. Block.one has been bullish on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for several years and believes that they have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems.\n\nBitmain Technologies\n\nBitmain is a China-based company that designs and manufactures ASIC Bitcoin miners. The company is estimated to have amassed over 70,000 BTC. Bitmain has been a major player in the Bitcoin mining industry since its inception and continues to be a dominant force in the space.\n\nThe Tezos Foundation\n\nOne of the biggest Bitcoin investors worldwide is the Swiss-based Tezos Foundation. The Foundation has a major impact on the Tezos protocol and the cryptocurrency ecosystem thanks to its holdings of more than 17,500 BTC. The Foundation was created to aid Tezos blockchain-related projects and efforts, and it has helped research teams all across the world.\n\nStone Ridge Holdings\n\nA financial services company with a few prominent assets in its portfolio and an excellent clientele, Stone Ridge Holdings is situated in New York City. One of the company\u2019s greatest selling points is its expanding Bitcoin holdings; according to current estimates, Stone Ridge is one of the top 10,000 Bitcoin holders and one of the largest cryptocurrency investors.\n\nPantera Capital\n\nPantera Capital is a blockchain investment firm that has been active in the cryptocurrency space since 2013. The company is estimated to hold over 7,000 BTC. Pantera Capital has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and has made several successful investments in the space over the years.\n\nMassMutual\n\nOne of the most prosperous mutual benefit societies and insurance firms in the US is MassMutual. They garnered media attention in 2020 when they bought Bitcoin valued at $100 million. This places MassMutual as one of the top Bitcoin investors and puts the company at the forefront of financial technology.\n\nMassMutual has taken the lead in adopting these new digital assets as an investment possibility thanks to this enormous pool of assets\u2014estimated to be over 3,500 Bitcoin\u2014that it currently controls.\n\nLisk Foundation\n\nThe Lisk Platform, an open-source blockchain application platform, is supported by the Lisk Foundation, a non-profit organization. It aids in the creation of sidechain applications and decentralized applications for businesses. About 1,898 Bitcoins are held by the Foundation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ownership of the most Bitcoins by private individuals raises questions about the decentralization and fairness of the cryptocurrency market. However, it also highlights the potential for significant wealth creation and influence within the industry. While the ownership of most Bitcoins by private individuals may challenge the ideals of decentralization, it is important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages of development and is subject to change."
