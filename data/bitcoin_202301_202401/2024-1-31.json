        "title": "A Texas Town's Misery Underscores the Impact of Bitcoin Mines - TIME",
        "content": "Every night, the nurse anesthetist Cheryl Shadden lies awake in her home in Granbury, Texas, listening to a nonstop roar. \u201cIt\u2019s like sitting on the runway of an airport where jets are taking off, one after another,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can't even walk out on your back patio and speak to somebody five feet away and have them hear you at all.\u201d\n\nThe noise comes from a nearby bitcoin mining operation, which set up shop at a power plant in Granbury last year. Since then, residents in the surrounding area have complained to public officials about an incessant din that they say keeps them awake, gives them migraines, and seemingly has caused wildlife to flee the region. \u201cMy citizens are suffering,\u201d says Hood County Constable John Shirley.\n\nGranbury is one of many towns across the U.S. feeling the negative impacts of bitcoin mining, an energy-intensive process that powers and protects the cryptocurrency. Those impacts include carbon and noise pollution, and increased costs on consumers\u2019 utility bills. According to the New York Times, there are 34 large scale bitcoin mines across the U.S. In 2022, the crypto market tumbled, in part due to high-profile collapses of crypto companies like Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX. But in 2023, prices rebounded once again, and mining companies decided to expand their operations in order to cash in, causing global energy consumption for mining to double, according to one study. Critics say that mining is causing both long-term environmental damage, due to its energy use, as well as local harm. \u201cWe\u2019re at a loss here,\u201d Granbury resident Shadden says. \u201cWe want our lives back.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is so energy-intensive because it relies on a process known as proof-of-work. Rather than being overseen by a single watchdog, bitcoin is designed to disperse the responsibility of the network\u2019s integrity to voluntary \u201cminers\u201d around the globe, who prevent tampering through a complex cryptographic process that consumes a vast amount of energy. Over the last few years, Texas has become a global leader in crypto mining because miners can access cheap energy and land there, as well as benefit from friendly tax laws and regulation. Bitcoin miners consume about 2,100 megawatts of the state's power supplies, and companies like Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital Holdings have recently expanded in the state. (Other states, conversely, have pushed back on the industry: In 2022, New York imposed a moratorium on bitcoin mining over concerns that miners were overusing renewable energy resources.)\n\nMore From TIME\n\nIn December, Marathon paid $178 million to purchase bitcoin mines in Kearney, Nebraska and Granbury from Generate Capital. But with the Granbury purchase, Marathon also inherited a swath of angry nearby residents across Hood County whose lives have been upended by the mining facility. Generate Capital started operating the 300-megawatt facility, which sits about an hour southwest of Fort Worth, in 2023. Initially, many residents were unaware what, exactly, was causing the noise. Shannon Wolf, who lives about 8 miles from the plant, first assumed that the rumble was coming from a nearby train. \u201cIt has woken me from a dead sleep before,\u201d she says.\n\nThe rumble, it turned out, comes from the massive cooling fans that the facility runs to keep their computers from overheating. Data centers, like bitcoin mines, also run massive cooling fans that have drawn the ire of nearby residents.\n\nAs residents learned what had caused the din, social media platforms like NextDoor and Facebook flooded with complaints. \u201cThis sound has been driving me to the point of insanity. I have continuous migraines, I can barely get out of my head, vomiting, nosebleeds, painful knots on my scalp,\u201d wrote one commenter. \u201cAll the birds have left, only [buzzards],\u201d wrote another poster.\n\nAs complaints swelled, local officials brought their concerns to the site\u2019s operator, US Bitcoin Corp. Over the summer, the company agreed to construct a 24-foot sound barrier wall on one end of the property at the cost of $1 to $2 million. But while the wall reduced sound in some areas, it actually amplified it in others. \u201cTo be honest, the complaints have gotten louder for us since the mitigation efforts,\u201d Constable John Shirley says.\n\nShirley says that he is monitoring the decibel levels of the facility. Texas state law stipulates that a noise is considered unreasonable if it exceeds 85 decibels. For comparison, vacuum cleaners often run at around 75 decibels\u2014and a cardiologist told TIME in 2018 that chronic exposure to anything over 60 decibels had the potential to do harm to the cardiovascular system. Shadden took her own readings at her house near the Bitcoin mining facility that reached 103 decibels.\n\nBut the maximum penalty for breaking that Texas law is a $500 fine, Shirley says, adding: \u201cThe state law is inadequate.\u201d He says that he has been talking to the county attorney\u2019s office about options for recourse. \u201cIf we have a repeated violation problem, he will be looking into potential injunctive relief,\u201d he says.\n\nThe community\u2019s ire boiled over at a town hall on Jan. 29, hosted by Shirley and Hood County Commissioner Nannette Samuelson. About 75 people filled the room to complain about the facility. Complaints from attendees included migraines that required trips to the emergency room and a vertigo diagnosis. One attendee said she had been forced to put her chihuahua on seizure medication. Others claimed that their windows rattled from the vibrations, and that the noise made their homes unsellable.\n\n\u201cHow does Hood County benefit from having such a ridiculous thing?\u201d asked one woman. \u201cWhat does this community gain from having them there?\u201d\n\nCharlie Schumacher, the vice president of corporate communications at Marathon Digital Holdings, wrote in an email to TIME that the company was unaware of the noise issues when it purchased the site. He said Marathon was commissioning a third party to conduct a sound study as early as next week. And on Feb. 1, three days after the town hall, Marathon announced that it planned to take over full day-to-day control of the Granbury mine from its previous operators.\n\n\u201cMarathon deeply values our relationships with the communities in which we live and work, and we appreciate the candid input our neighbors have shared with us in recent weeks,\u201d he wrote. \"Our team will now have more influence over the sight and can hopefully have a more positive impact for the community. We are in constant touch with local officials and working with community leaders to gain more information about the situation and to work on solutions.\n\nUS Bitcoin Corp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile the constant noise has become a major irritant in the county, residents also worry about the facility\u2019s impact on their power supply and the surrounding environment. Texas has a notoriously fragile grid that becomes strained in cold weather: a 2021 deep freeze caused millions of people to lose power. Wolf Hollow II, the gas plant that supplies the Granbury bitcoin mine with energy, failed during that crisis.\n\nThis year, parts of Texas were hit with a frigid arctic front in mid-January, with temperatures dropping into the teens. The state\u2019s grid operator, ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas), asked Texans to conserve electricity. The grid held up under strain, and Wolf Hollow continued to operate at full capacity, as did the mining operation.\n\nNevertheless, some residents in rural Hood County lost power. That included Hunter Sims, who lives a mile and a half from the plant and lost power for 9 hours, relying on a backup generator for his well. Sims was angered that he was without power while the mining operation continued unabated. Overall, he says his quality of life has worsened due to the facility\u2019s noise pollution. \u201cWhen I\u2019m sitting in my living room, I can hear a loud humming,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t really relax.\u201d\n\nA representative for Constellation Energy, the company that runs Wolf Hollow, said that any power outages were not a result of any issues at the plant, but rather on the local level of transmission or distribution.\n\nRead More: Fact-Checking 8 Claims About Crypto\u2019s Climate Impact\n\nErik Kojola, a senior Climate Research Specialist for Greenpeace USA, says he\u2019s monitored similar complaints from residents near new bitcoin mining centers across the country, in Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska, and upstate New York. He also contends that bitcoin mining poses a much larger threat to the environment. \u201cBitcoin mining is essentially a lifeline for fossil fuels,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's ultimately creating a new industrial scale demand for energy at a time where we need to be reducing our energy use.\u201d\n\nBack in Granbury, the discomfort caused by the plant is causing some consternation for a region that largely prides itself on being pro-industry and anti-regulation. \u201cI agree with people having the right to own a business if it\u2019s not illegal or amoral,\u201d says Granbury resident Wolf. \u201cBut when you\u2019re harming a group of people, there needs to be some type of remedy.\u201d\n\nCorrection, Feb. 2, 2024\n\nA previous version of this story misstated when the Wolf Hollow II power plant failed. It failed in 2021; it did not fail during a 2011 storm, though a separate but nearby plant, Wolf Hollow I, did. The story also mischaracterized how the Texas grid performed in mid-January. Some individuals lost power, but the grid held up."

But it later dipped to a low of about $16,000 and is today again hovering around $40,000.\n\n'It cannot be stopped'\n\nBukele had promised the issuing of $1 billion in bitcoin bonds, partly to finance his city. But that did not happen.\n\nThe government has invested an undisclosed amount of taxpayer money in the cryptocurrency -- vowing at one point it would buy a bitcoin a day -- though it is not known whether this has come to pass.\n\nA poll by the Central American University found that hardly anyone used bitcoin last year in El Salvador, where the other legal tender is the US dollar.\n\nAccording to the UN, more than a quarter of Salvadorans live in poverty, while the US State Department has warned the country's public debt was \"on an unsustainable path.\"\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele's bitcoin gambit is widely thought to have failed \u00a9 MARVIN RECINOS / AFP\n\nBukele had promoted the move to bitcoin as a way to bring more Salvadorans, most of them lacking bank accounts, into the formal economy -- including through the receipt of remittances from abroad, a major contributor to GDP.\n\nThe change meant that every Salvadoran business -- even neighborhood shopkeepers -- had to accept the cryptocurrency as payment.\n\nBut the IMF and World Bank warned that quite apart from currency volatility, the move could leave the country vulnerable to money laundering and other illicit activity that could in turn affect underlying stability.\n\nDespite his crypto gambit widely seen as a failure -- at least for now -- Bukele remains immensely popular ahead of presidential elections on Sunday.\n\nPolls show his approval ratings hovering around 90 percent, thanks largely to a crackdown on criminal gangs.\n\nHis actions are credited with vastly improving the daily life of crime- and violence-fatigued citizens, but also criticized for human rights violations.\n\nKeegan said people told him he was \"crazy\" when he predicted a decade ago that one day a country would adopt bitcoin as tender.\n\nWhen bitcoiner Corbin Keegan needs money, he rides his rickety motorcycle to the city of Conchagua to draw money from an ATM that disperses bitcoin and dollars \u00a9 Marvin RECINOS / AFP\n\nWhat he did not know at the time was that the country would be El Salvador, and that it would take him to a new life in Central America.\n\nIn Playa Blanca, nobody uses crypto.\n\nWhen Keegan needs money, he rides his rickety motorcycle to the city of Conchagua about 20 kilometers away to draw money from an ATM that disperses bitcoin and dollars.\n\nWhile he waits for the new city to arise, the self-described jack of all trades fishes and does odd jobs for neighbors who fondly call him \"El Gringo.\"\n\nKeegan would not disclose how much he had invested in bitcoin, but remains convinced that crypto is \"the future.

        "content": "Grayscale\u2019s victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission ushered in a watershed moment for crypto.\n\n\u201cThey fought the law and won,\u201d Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s ETF analyst, told Fortune. \u201cYou have to give them credit and tip your hat.\u201d\n\nWhen the SEC repeatedly denied Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its closed-end trust into a spot exchange-traded fund, the asset manager fought back. But since the much anticipated Jan. 11 approval, Grayscale\u2019s trust-turned-fund, GBTC, has seen outflows of over $5.2 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nBy freeing up investors to redeem their shares, it unleashed staggering outflows, leading some analysts to speculate whether Grayscale could be the architect of its own downfall.\n\nUnderstanding the outflows\n\nStarting in 2013 as a closed-end trust fund, GBTC was the only real option to trade Bitcoin on the stock market, for which investors paid a premium. But since February 2021, it has traded at a deep discount, hitting record lows of almost 50% in December 2022. Investors had been locked into the trust, while they watched GBTC\u2019s discount on the underlying asset, Bitcoin, widen, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart told Fortune.\n\nThat was the case until Jan. 11.\n\nExperts told Fortune the outflows so far typically have fallen into three categories: investors wanting to jump ship for lower fees; sales by FTX; and investors who were betting on the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETFs are engaged in a fierce race to the bottom on rates, a competition in which Grayscale has no interest.\n\nAt 1.5%, GBTC charges the highest fee among peers, whereas competitors have all kept fees below 0.3%, according to Bloomberg data. Both Seyffart and Balchunas estimate that a third of the outflows belong to investors seeking lower fees, and lightly held GBTC in their IRAs, and thus aren\u2019t subject to capital gains taxes. (This also could mean about a third of outflows have been reinvested into competing ETFs.)\n\nMeanwhile, the analysts also attribute outflows to FTX liquidating its GBTC holdings as part of the firm\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. FTX has sold 22.28 million shares\u2014worth roughly $1 billion\u2014to eliminate its GBTC position, CoinDesk reported.\n\nThe third category of sellers, Seyffart and Balchunas explained, likely have been typical \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d investors. \u201cThey were using GBTC to bet on a Bitcoin ETF approval,\u201d says Seyffart. \u201cThey were just basically betting on the discount collapsing.\u201d\n\nA Grayscale spokeswoman told Fortune that GBTC will continue to provide investors and capital market allocators with \u201ccredible, confident, and regulated\u201d exposure to Bitcoin, and remains the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the ETF market.\n\n\u2018Playing the waiting game\u2019\n\nBut outflows haven\u2019t yet dislodged Grayscale\u2019s market dominance. With assets of over $21 billion, GBTC still represents the lion\u2019s share of the total Bitcoin ETF value of about $27.2 billion. This leaves the 10 further funds that have joined the so-called Cointucky Derby since the approval trailing. Meanwhile, digital asset manager CoinShares reported on Monday that outflows may be beginning to slow.\n\nDuring the first two weeks of trading, the daily outflow average was approximately $530 million, whereas it has been reducing since Thursday, falling to $191 million on Monday\u2014the lowest since trading began.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, last week was the last with strong outflow,\u201d said Matteo Greco, a crypto analyst at Fineqia. But he also said fresh inflows to GBTC are unlikely. \u201cFor new customers, it\u2019s not really sensible, because they have much, much less-expensive options.\u201d\n\nThe remaining GBTC likely belongs to non-IRA investors who are planning on staying put, analysts said, because redeeming those shares would be a taxable event. The 20% tax on large gains accumulated since the trust\u2019s formation will trump the 1.5% annual fee. \u201cThe math is gonna favor staying,\u201d says Balchunas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably just playing the game of \u2018Let me just wait this thing out\u2019 for two or three years, until that calculation on the spreadsheet at DCG [Digital Currency Group] flips, and they reduce the price,\u201d says Swan CEO Cory Klippsten, hinting at a fee cut in the next few years. \u201cI think a lot of people are just playing the waiting game.\u201d"

        "title": "5 Best Bitcoin ETFs for March 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -4.79%) has been one of the most exciting investments of the 2000s. One Bitcoin was worthless when it launched in 2009, but each coin is worth the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars today. The blockchain technology that underpins the original digital currency has spawned thousands of altcoins and decentralized finance applications along the way, with the most successful being Ethereum (ETH -4.93%). The price of Bitcoin has rallied as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval neared for new funds based on Bitcoin's spot price. It's no wonder so many investors have wanted a part of the action. But investing in Bitcoin isn't always that simple. That's where a new Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) might come into play. Here's what you need to know.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies requires some extra work over and above what's involved in investing in stocks, bonds, and the like. Many traditional brokerage firms don't support cryptocurrency trading, so an account may need to be opened with a crypto trading exchange. Additionally, there's the matter of storing crypto, which requires the use of a crypto wallet. A workaround for these issues is buying a Bitcoin ETF or fund that trades on a stock exchange so your investment in Bitcoin can be held in the same account as your other stocks, bonds, and traditional investment securities. What are Bitcoin ETFs? What are Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs are funds that trade on a stock exchange that attempt to track the performance of Bitcoin. When you buy an ETF, you aren't buying the underlying investment directly. Rather, you're buying shares of a fund that either invests in or attempts to mimic the performance of a particular security or index -- Bitcoin, in this case. Until 2024, there were no ETFs that were able to directly own Bitcoin. That's because trading in cryptocurrency and other digital currencies was still unregulated by the SEC. However, a number of new ETF and investment firms finally had their applications approved by the SEC to launch ETFs that directly purchase Bitcoin (including Cathie Wood's Ark Invest).\n\nBitcoin vs. Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin ETFs Why buy a Bitcoin ETF instead of Bitcoin directly? After all, even the best fund isn't going to perfectly track the crypto's price since there are fees built into ETFs to pay for management. Besides avoiding the added complexity of opening an account with a crypto exchange and safely storing Bitcoin, one big reason to opt for an ETF is that it's easier to get Bitcoin investment exposure in an individual retirement account (IRA). At this point, only a few specialty investment companies support crypto trading within an IRA account. But if you want to keep Bitcoin with the rest of your investments, buying a fund or ETF might be your ticket. List of 5 Bitcoin ETFs 5 Bitcoin ETFs and funds for 2024 Before new SEC approvals in January 2024, Bitcoin funds were only generally available using futures contracts in their portfolios. A new batch of Bitcoin ETFs can now directly purchase Bitcoin and hold it in custody (or outsource the holding of the Bitcoin to a third party). Here are five options to consider:\n\nData as of Jan. 30, 2024. ETF Name Assets Description iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) $2.2 billion From investment giant BlackRock, this is the first of the new Bitcoin ETFs to reach $2 billion in assets. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (NYSEMKT:GBTC) $21.4 billion As of this writing, this is the largest ETF tracking Bitcoin's performance. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NYSEMKT:FBTC) $1.34 billion Another new ETF launch from one of the world's largest investment managers. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT:ARKB) $637 million Ark Invest, Cathie Wood's investment firm, making its foray into Bitcoin with an ETF sponsored by crypto company 21Shares. Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF\n\n(NYSEMKT:BTCO) $295 million Top fund manager Invesco's new Bitcoin ETF.\n\n1. iShares Bitcoin Trust The iShares family of ETFs, from investment management titan BlackRock (BLK -2.08%), is among the first of the new Bitcoin spot price ETFs approved by the SEC. It is also quickly emerging as one of the largest Bitcoin funds, scooping up more than $2 billion in investor assets under management in a mere couple of weeks. While iShares takes care of the management of the passive investment vehicle, Coinbase's (COIN -7.17%) Custody service actually holds the Bitcoin that makes up the ETF's portfolio of assets. In fact, Coinbase Custody is scooping up a large share of Bitcoin from the new batch of SEC-approved ETFs. iShares is a well-established ETF provider with decades of experience. The iShares Bitcoin Trust is also an affordable option. It is waiving half its 0.25% management fee (or $2.50 in annual fees for every $1,000 invested) to just 0.12% unless the fund reaches $5 billion in assets under management before the first 12 months from inception. For reference, the inception date was Jan. 5, 2024.\n\n2. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF Grayscale's Bitcoin fund was originally created in 2013. Before 2024, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust wasn't an ETF but an investment trust with units trading over the counter (traded via broker-dealer networks instead of a centralized exchange). Grayscale had its application approved by the SEC and converted the Bitcoin trust to an ETF in early January 2024. It now offers investors more direct exposure to Bitcoin. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF charges a hefty 1.5% annual fee ($15 for every $1,000 invested each year) compared to its newer ETF peers, although the fee was reduced from 2% in January 2024. Owing to the higher fee, the fund had extensive outflows of investor funds when the new ETFs were approved and began trading. Nevertheless, this is currently the largest fund tied to Bitcoin's fate, and the company has extensive knowledge about the crypto. If you want a product that seeks to follow Bitcoin's price changes without buying Bitcoin, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust might be a good place to start your search. 3. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund Fidelity is another global investment giant and one of the first to dabble in the nascent cryptocurrency industry. It launched a cryptocurrency exchange in 2023, so an ETF on the top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is a natural fit. Fidelity's Bitcoin fund also started trading in January 2024, so it has a short history. It has an annual expense ratio of just 0.25%, although there is no fee waiver. But given Fidelity's long tenure in the investment world, the ETF is worth considering. 4. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF It comes as no surprise that Cathie Wood's Ark Invest would also launch a new Bitcoin ETF. Wood and company are known for investing in disruptive new technology, and blockchain and Bitcoin are no exception. As the name implies, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF is sponsored by cryptocurrency investment outfit 21Shares. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF has one of the lowest expense ratios at 0.21% per year and is waiving its fee until July 2024 or until fund assets reach $1 billion. Given its hot start in collecting investor assets (more than $600 million at the end of January 2024), the fee waiver may not last much longer.\n\n5. Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF Rounding out the list is another giant investment fund manager, Invesco (IVZ -2.22%). Its Galaxy Bitcoin ETF was also recently approved by the SEC. The fund is in partnership with crypto company Galaxy Asset Management, a division of Galaxy Digital Holdings (BRPHF -8.8%). Invesco's Bitcoin is being held in custody directly (vs. a third party like Coinbase). The ETF is also waiving its 0.39% annual fee for the first six months (until July 2024) up to $5 billion in assets. The managers have the ability to extend the waiver longer if they decide to do so (to obtain more investor funds).\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nChoose the right Bitcoin investment product carefully Bitcoin ETFs and funds aren't a perfect replacement for direct investment if you want exposure to the largest digital currency. However, there are benefits to selecting an ETF since it can be a workaround for getting Bitcoin's performance inside your IRA. Just remember to take a measured approach, given the inherent volatility in crypto prices.\n\nFAQ\n\nFAQ about Bitcoin ETFs Which ETF is best for Bitcoin? angle-down angle-up The best Bitcoin ETF to choose will depend on various factors, like the annual fee, the reputation of the investment manager and its custodian (who holds the actual Bitcoin in the fund portfolio), and the fund's total investor assets under management. Since new Bitcoin spot price ETFs are new as of January 2024, these criteria are subject to frequent change in the first year. Does a Bitcoin ETF exist? angle-down angle-up Yes, there are now many Bitcoin ETFs that actually invest in Bitcoin itself, based on the top cryptocurrency's actual daily price movements. Most of the top investment management firms have launched new Bitcoin ETFs. What is the new ETF for Bitcoin? angle-down angle-up Some of the new ETFs for Bitcoin include iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF. What does the approval of Spot Bitcoin Exchange mean? angle-down angle-up On Jan. 10, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded products. This means a new batch of ETFs that, directly or through a third-party custodian, can hold the cryptocurrency Bitcoin directly in their portfolio, giving investors an easier way to gain cryptocurrency exposure in their investment accounts."

        "title": "Should You Buy the Bitcoin Dip Today? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a historic start to the year with the approval of 11 new exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Bitcoin (BTC -5.01%) fell by nearly 20% in the wake of the landmark decision and remains down more than 10% from the peak today. In what is shaping up to be a classic \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" event, hopes that the cryptocurrency's new home on Wall Street would mean it only goes up from here might need some reconsidering.\n\nYet, despite the pullback (and to the dismay of critics), Bitcoin remains in a healthy position as the prospects of a bull market loom. From here on out, any chance to grab Bitcoin while it slips should be viewed as an opportunity. Here's why.\n\nA natural phenomenon\n\nBitcoin is known for its volatility. Over the course of its 15-year history, it has experienced roughly eight drawdowns of more than 50% and three resulting in a correction of more than 70%. These pullbacks usually mark the beginning of bear markets. But even when things are going well and Bitcoin is in a bull market, it can experience significant declines.\n\nTake a look at Bitcoin's last bull run in 2021 as evidence. On the way up to its current all-time high, there were roughly five instances when Bitcoin shed more than 20% over the course of a week or two. At one point in 2021, it slipped 50% when it fell from $58,940 in May to $29,800 by July. Remarkably, from there it went on to more than double in a matter of just four months when it soared to nearly $69,000.\n\nThis turbulent price action often scares investors, but there are reasonable explanations that help contextualize Bitcoin's volatility. First, we must remember that Bitcoin trades 24 hours, seven days a week, all around the world. Devoid of any specific trading hours like the stock market, Bitcoin is truly an international currency. Furthermore, the majority of trading that occurs is done with leverage. That means that when Bitcoin moves through levels where significant interest piles up, the moves are exacerbated and sudden.\n\nFundamentals remain intact\n\nWith some additional context showing that Bitcoin is no stranger to drawdowns even in bull markets, investors should have a bit of reassurance that nothing out of the ordinary has occurred. In fact, when accounting for growth in Bitcoin's key fundamentals, confidence that these pullbacks are just minor speed bumps in its journey of price appreciation should only solidify.\n\nAt its core, Bitcoin is nothing more than an open-source network where users can conduct transactions directly with each other. To remain viable, it is imperative that Bitcoin grow more decentralized, secure, and resilient over time. Fortunately, it is.\n\nOne key metric capturing Bitcoin's evolution is known as hash rate. Used to quantify Bitcoin's computing power, hash rate is one of the most important statistics investors can use to measure the network's strength and overall health. As it turns out, Bitcoin's hash rate is just off its all-time high. It hit a peak in early January 2024, and there are more miners and nodes participating in the network than ever before. Today, it is estimated that the Bitcoin blockchain network's total computational power is 500 times greater than the world's most powerful supercomputers.\n\nNot only is the network growing more robust, but trends in adoption continue to grow favorably. Take the total number of digital wallets with a Bitcoin balance as evidence of this. Today, there are more than 53 million wallets holding varying amounts of Bitcoin. That's 10 million more names than just a year ago and twice the amount seen five years ago.\n\nSmooth and steady\n\nOn the surface, Bitcoin's recent volatility could be misleading and potentially troubling. Yet, when considering the scale and frequency of its corrections, even in bull markets, Bitcoin's recent pullback is par for the course.\n\nIn fact, one could argue that Bitcoin has never been in better shape. While its price bounces up and down, the network's resilience and growth remain refreshing constants. Until any indicators hint at a lack of fundamental strength, consider this dip, and any future ones, as a reason to grab the world's original cryptocurrency at a discount."

        "title": "Best Bitcoin and Crypto Wallets for March 2024 - CNET",
        "content": "Once you\u2019ve purchased your cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll need somewhere to hold it. While you could choose to leave it on a crypto exchange in a custodial wallet -- which means you don\u2019t fully own the asset, but instead you\u2019re trusting the company to hold it for you -- the better option is to move it into a wallet you own.\n\nCrypto wallets can take the form of external hardware devices or software that runs on your mobile device or computer. And while their primary function is to keep your crypto safe and allow you to make trades, they also offer more control over your digital currency than you\u2019ll get using a standard account at a crypto exchange or brokerage.\n\nUnless you\u2019re making daily crypto trades or have only a modest amount of money invested in crypto, we recommend you don\u2019t store your crypto in a custodial wallet. Best practices for holding crypto include purchasing a hardware wallet for offline storage. Your next best option is a \u201cnoncustodial\u201d software wallet or app. We\u2019ll look at both options here in an effort to help you find the best crypto wallet for your own situation.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Best for beginners See at Coinbase Coinbase, which went public in April 2022, is the best known cryptocurrency exchange in the US. The company makes it easy to trade well-known cryptocurrencies from bitcoin to dogecoin, and has its own Visa-backed debit card that integrates with Apple Pay and Google. If you\u2019re new to cryptocurrency, the Coinbase Wallet is a good place to start. It can be downloaded as an app for Android or iOS, the interface is intuitive and the wallet is fully integrated with the company\u2019s exchange, which makes it easy to conduct transactions -- including purchasing coins and tokens with traditional currency. Unlike the company\u2019s exchange, the Coinbase Wallet is noncustodial; that means that only you have access to your wallet\u2019s private key, which is generated with a 12-word recovery phrase when you sign up. Note that there\u2019s a difference between storing your cryptocurrency on Coinbase\u2019s exchange, which is custodial, and the wallet, which is not. But the integration between them makes it fairly simple to transfer funds back and forth. Trezor Model T Best security features See at Trezor Trezor\u2019s new user interface, Trezor Suite, just came out last year, replacing the company\u2019s Wallet Web app. This analysis reflects our initial impression of a new product, therefore. But Trezor has been around for quite some time, established back in 2011 as a subsidiary of Czech-based SatoshiLabs. The $219 Model T is Trezor\u2019s second-generation hardware wallet, and it comes with many of the same features as the Ledger Nano X, detailed below. One major difference is that Trezor\u2019s software is completely open-source, which affords some additional protection -- theoretically, at least: The code that powers the wallet is available for scrutiny, and, as thinking goes, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Trezor Suite is designed to run natively on your desktop, which generally provides greater security than a web-based app, though you can also access Trezor Suite through the company\u2019s website. Trezor wallets currently support more than 1,800 coins and tokens, and you can make transactions directly in Trezor Suite with the company\u2019s integrated exchange. Shaped like an old-school stopwatch, the Model T comes with a touchscreen and a USB cable to connect to your computer; it also features a microSD card if you want to add encrypted storage directly to your hardware wallet. It does not feature Bluetooth support, however -- an omission that some security advocates prefer, as Bluetooth connectivity could be an attack vector for hackers to exploit. Ledger Nano X Good balance between accessibility and security See at Ledger The Nano X is Ledger\u2019s second-generation cold storage wallet. The integrated Ledger Live platform, which is easy to learn and use, supports more than 5,500 coins and tokens including bitcoin, ether and XRP. The wallet can be connected to your computer via a USB cable and Android and iOS mobile devices via Bluetooth -- a connection the Model T lacks. The device is sturdy and features a small LED screen. To start, you\u2019ll set up a PIN, then a 24-word seed phrase. The seed phrase acts as your wallet\u2019s private key. Just like other wallets, as long as you keep the private key safe, you won\u2019t lose your crypto assets -- even if you lose your wallet. It\u2019s important to note that Ledger suffered a data breach in July 2020, which resulted in the theft of some customers\u2019 personal data -- but, significantly, not their crypto assets. No private keys to wallets were taken, but there were reports of customers receiving phishing emails and other scamming threats afterward. That noted, Ledger has long been a trusted name in the crypto world, but the data breach is a good reminder to be careful online -- especially when it comes to dealing in crypto assets. Exodus Best for desktop users See at Exodus Exodus is a hot wallet, which means it\u2019s a software wallet that\u2019s connected to the internet; but it\u2019s noncustodial, which means that only you have access to your private key -- a 12-word password phrase that protects access to your crypto assets. The Exodus wallet is designed to run on Mac, Windows and Linux computers, though there\u2019s a companion app available for Android and iOS devices. The desktop user interface is slick and easy to learn. Your wallet is seamlessly integrated into the Exodus exchange, so it\u2019s easy to make transactions. Exodus supports more than 260 types of cryptocurrency including bitcoin, ether, tether USD and dogecoin. But the exchange has some noteworthy limits: If you want to purchase crypto with US dollars and store it in the Exodus wallet, you\u2019ll need to first purchase the asset on a centralized crypto exchange, such as Coinbase, and then transfer the assets to Exodus. The app version allows purchases of bitcoin with US dollars. And once you have an asset in your wallet, it can be easily exchanged for other supported assets. While the wallet itself is free to use, Exodus charges a fee for transactions made via its exchange. Hot storage wallets are generally considered less secure than cold storage wallets, and some Exodus users may eventually want to upgrade to cold storage. The good news: Exodus is fully compatible with Trezor\u2019s One and Model T hardware. Mycelium Best for mobile users See at Mycelium Mycelium has been around since the beginning of the crypto era, and the Mycelium wallet is one of the oldest and best-known bitcoin wallets. This is a mobile-only wallet -- there is currently no desktop version -- that supports both Android and iOS. The Mycelium wallet has an appealingly simple interface, but it supports fewer kinds of crypto than others profiled here: You can send and receive bitcoin, ether and ERC-20 tokens such as tether USD, USD coin and binance USD -- but not the hundreds of esoteric coins that have been developed over the past few years. You can buy and sell bitcoin directly in the app, and Mycelium lets you buy bitcoin with regular fiat currency. The Mycelium wallet is noncustodial, so you\u2019ll have sole access to your private key and PIN. This wallet is also the only hot storage wallet on our list that\u2019s completely open-source. Though there are security advantages in that, it also comes with limited tech support options; basically, if you get stuck, you can submit a help ticket to the email address listed at the bottom of the webpage. For more advanced users, Mycelium supports QR codes, allows you to set custom transaction fees and offers compatibility with hardware wallets from Trezor, Ledger and KeepKey.\n\nBest bitcoin and crypto wallets, compared\n\nBest for beginners Best for security Best balance between accessibility and security Best for desktop Best for mobile users Wallet Coinbase wallet Trezor Model T Ledger Nano X Exodus Mycelium Wallet price Free $219 $149 Free Free Offline storage No Yes Yes No No Custodial No No No No No Mobile version Yes Compatible with mobile app Compatible with mobile app Compatible with mobile app Yes How many supported coins and tokens 11+ 1,800+ 5,500+ 260+ 10+\n\nWhat is a crypto wallet and how does it work?\n\nA cryptocurrency wallet is how you access and store your digital assets. They\u2019re available as a physical, offline wallet, known as cold wallet or a digital, online wallet, known as a hot wallet.\n\nThere are three kinds of hot wallets -- mobile app wallets, desktop wallets and online wallets. Mobile app wallets are used on your phone to facilitate purchases using crypto while desktop wallets are software installed on your computer. Online wallets are custodial wallets owned by the companies behind crypto exchanges. No matter which type of wallet you have, you\u2019re able to transfer, store and receive your coins with it.\n\nYour crypto isn\u2019t actually stored on the wallet, however, but rather your keys to access the coins which are stored on the blockchain. Your key is a unique code that verifies that the assets you\u2019re trying to access are yours. There\u2019s a public key which is how you send crypto to your wallet, and a private key which proves ownership of the assets.\n\nBoth hot and cold wallets have their drawbacks. A hot wallet could be targeted by malicious hackers, while a physical wallet could be misplaced and cause you to lose access to your digital assets. Physical wallets are also more expensive as most hot wallets are free.\n\nDo I need a crypto wallet?\n\nWhile you could keep your assets in an online brokerage like Coinbase, a crypto wallet is the safest way to store your digital assets. It can only be accessed by a unique key that can\u2019t be replicated once it\u2019s generated. That also means it\u2019s very important to store your key in a secure spot where you won\u2019t lose it and only you can access it.\n\nHot wallet vs. cold wallet\n\nA hot wallet is a digital wallet like MetaMask that\u2019s connected to the internet. While secure, it\u2019s not as secure as a cold wallet, which is a physical wallet that\u2019s kept offline and can only be accessed using a dongle \u2013 a physical USB that has to be plugged into your computer.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the dongle and your key, you won\u2019t be able to get into the wallet. A popular example of a cold wallet is a Ledger. You\u2019re able to access your wallet from a computer that\u2019s disconnected from the internet.\n\nAnother example of a cold wallet is a paper wallet. It\u2019s a physical sheet of paper that has your private keys on it. Again, while it\u2019s safer from cyberattacks because it\u2019s offline, make sure you keep it in a safe place.\n\nHow to choose a crypto wallet\n\nChoosing which crypto wallet is best for you will come down to how secure you want your assets to be, and how much trading you intend to do.\n\nPeople who invest large amounts of money will likely want to opt for a cold wallet as it\u2019s more secure, while people who dabble in investing will likely be fine not spending the extra money and using a hot wallet.\n\nSecurity\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency, security is perhaps the most important thing to consider. You want your digital assets to be as safe as possible from hackers and fraudsters looking to steal them. The best defense from a hacker is going offline, so a cold wallet will be the most secure route to take. Being a physical object, cold wallets can still be lost or stolen, so it\u2019s important to store your cold wallet securely.\n\nHowever, if you do lose your wallet, you can still access your crypto by using your seed phrase. Seed phrases are randomly generated combinations of words that can be used to recover or access your account in the instance you don\u2019t have your cold wallet or your hot wallet becomes disconnected.\n\nFees\n\nWhile transactions on the blockchain may come with fees, hot wallets like Exodus are typically free to use, while the cold wallets on this list cost up to $255.\n\nEase of use\n\nHot wallets are easier to use than cold wallets, simply because you don\u2019t need to take an extra step to access them. Hot wallets are connected to your browser via an extension, to your phone if you\u2019re using a mobile wallet, or via software downloaded to your computer. They can be accessed any time, while cold wallets require a physical dongle to be connected to your computer.\n\nAmount of trading\n\nIf you plan to do a lot of trading, you\u2019ll need a wallet with advanced features. Some wallets support a lower number of digital assets, so you\u2019ll want to opt for one that caters to a wider range of coins. You\u2019ll also need to be aware of any restrictions the wallet has around trading. A cold wallet is the better choice if you do intend on trading and storing higher volumes.\n\nHow to store your coins in a wallet\n\nYour wallet will have a public and private key. Your private key is how you access your assets, while the public key is used to send and receive crypto. When you purchase a coin, you\u2019ll have to input your public key as the address for where the digital asset is sent.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to always transfer a very small amount of cryptocurrency from the exchange you purchased it from, confirm that it made it to your wallet successfully and then transfer the rest. If you include the wrong address, your assets will be sent into the void with no way to be recovered.\n\nFAQs\n\nDo I need a crypto wallet? If you want to invest in cryptocurrency, you should invest in a wallet. That noted, if you\u2019re just dipping a toe, services such as PayPal and Robinhood allow you to buy a coin or fractions of a coin and store it on their servers. These are custodial wallets, however, where you don\u2019t hold the private key. We recommend noncustodial wallets for long-term cryptocurrency users and investors.\n\nHow much money do I need to open a crypto wallet? It depends. Hardware-based wallets generally cost between $100 and $200, though many software-based wallets are free. Most don\u2019t require you to actually own any cryptocurrency.\n\nWhich wallet is best for beginners? If you\u2019ve never used cryptocurrency before, we recommend Coinbase Wallet. Coinbase is a well-known, US-based crypto exchange that\u2019s easy to use, and it works well with Coinbase Wallet.\n\nWhich wallet is best for advanced users? Today\u2019s cold storage wallets can be quickly and easily connected to the internet for fast transactions, so most advanced users nowadays are probably most interested in a cold storage wallet. The hardware wallets sold by Ledger and Trezor are both good options.\n\nWhat are the risks? Cryptocurrency is subject to far less regulation than conventional investments and securities. While the lack of oversight is an attractive feature to some investors, it\u2019s important to know that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, experience dramatic price swings on a daily or even hourly basis and lack many of the protections of other forms of investment. The risks are significant.\n\nAre assets in crypto wallets insured? While the companies offering crypto wallets may offer some guarantees to customers and users, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation does not currently insure digital assets like cryptocurrency. That noted, the environment is evolving and many government agencies, including the FDIC, are gathering information and considering legislation for the future.\n\nWhat\u2019s the safest crypto wallet? Cold storage wallets are generally thought of as a more secure way to store cryptocurrency when compared to a hot storage wallet. If you plan to store a large amount of coins or tokens for any length of time, we recommend using a cold wallet.\n\nThe editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.

        "title": "Tesla Missed $500 Million In Bitcoin Gains: Will It Sell The Remaining 9,700 BTC? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "It is well known that Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk is a huge cryptocurrency proponent. From allowing customers to buy Tesla cars with Dogecoin (DOGE) to seemingly incessant support on social media, Musk has made his adoration for crypto known over the years. However, Musk and Tesla showed that some actions speak louder than words.\n\nIn February 2021, the company made a landmark investment of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. The investment was meant to earn extra returns on cash that would have earned little to no interest otherwise. At the time of the announcement, Bitcoin's price was hovering around $37,000. However, the price quickly spiked to over $50,000 on the news.\n\nIn March 2021, Bitcoin rose to a price above $60,000, reaching an all-time high. Because of this, Tesla decided to sell roughly 10% of its Bitcoin holdings for a sizable gain. Specifically, it sold 4,320 Bitcoins to receive net proceeds of over $250 million. Tesla's stock price fell around 20% in the same timeframe.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nTesla continued to hold nearly 40,000 Bitcoins throughout the rest of 2021 and into 2022. However, in June 2022, it sold a large portion of its holdings. These sales totaled nearly 30,000 Bitcoins or about 75% of its total holdings. According to Musk, the sale was intended to show Bitcoin's liquidity and ability to support large transactions and give Tesla some extra cash in the event of an economic downturn.\n\nThe sale was untimely, as Bitcoin was trading below $20,000, hitting 18-month lows. While the price of Bitcoin continued to fall throughout the rest of 2022, Bitcoin did extremely well in 2023, appreciating nearly 150% and reversing the difficulties seen in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, one can't help but wonder how much Tesla's huge Bitcoin portfolio could have been worth if it had not sold. At the beginning of 2024, just before the approval of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the price of Bitcoin briefly surpassed $47,000. If Tesla had held onto its original investment of 43,200 Bitcoins, it would have been worth just over $2 billion at $47,000 per Bitcoin.\n\nThis means that Tesla missed out on an extra $500 million in profit had it not sold its Bitcoin in March 2021 and June 2022.\n\nTesla still holds 9,720 Bitcoins, worth around $400 million at current prices. It will be interesting to see whether it holds on to the tokens in 2024 or sells. In the past, sales of Bitcoin have come when the price rises to new highs or when Tesla is in a tough spot financially. For the first case, some experts believe that Bitcoin could have a strong 2024 and potentially reach new all-time highs, which could spark a sale of Bitcoin. Conversely, Tesla has not had many issues with cash recently, and a soft landing is looking to be more feasible, giving reason to believe that Tesla could continue holding on to its Bitcoin reserves.\n\nEither way, it will be interesting to see what 2024 has in store for Bitcoin, Tesla and Tesla's Bitcoin holdings.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Tesla Missed $500 Million In Bitcoin Gains: Will It Sell The Remaining 9,700 BTC? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Should Investors Buy Bitcoin Before the Next Halving in 2024? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency investors have been on a wild ride the past few years, but their patience has paid off. Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC -5.01%) fell to less than $16,000 in late 2022 but has nearly tripled since then. Now, in 2024, something is happening that investors haven't seen since 2020.\n\nNo, it's not the presidential election. Bitcoin is halving. You might not know what that means if you've only owned Bitcoin over the last couple of years, but it's a notable event that could affect where the crypto's price goes.\n\nHere is what you need to know about what's coming and whether you should buy Bitcoin before it happens.\n\nThe halving is happening\n\nBitcoin runs on a decentralized ledger called a blockchain where every transaction is visible to everyone. That makes it secure because everyone on the blockchain can view and validate every transaction. As users make transactions, they are arranged into groups called blocks.\n\nMining is an essential part of how Bitcoin works. A new block must be validated before being formally added to the blockchain. Bitcoin miners use huge banks of computers to validate blocks and solve complex mathematical puzzles. It's like digging through a room filled with keys to find the unique one that unlocks the door. The blockchain rewards a miner who successfully solves a puzzle with new Bitcoins.\n\nToday, the Bitcoin reward is 6.25 coins for each mined block. The network reduces that reward by half every 210,000 blocks. This is called a halving. The point of the halving is to reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation. At the rate at which blocks are mined, the next halving will occur in April or May, just a few months from now.\n\nHow could that affect Bitcoin's price?\n\nBitcoin's supply is designed to be finite. Its creator set a fixed cap of 21 million coins. The halving is another mechanism intended to control how much Bitcoin enters circulation. The long-term investment pitch for Bitcoin is that more people will use it while supply growth simultaneously slows, meaning the price should rise.\n\nYou could easily say Bitcoin has proven very volatile, but when you zoom out, you'll see the price has trended higher. There's a case to make that halving, which occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020, tends to send Bitcoin's price higher.\n\nShould investors buy Bitcoin before it halves?\n\nBitcoin is volatile enough that investors shouldn't jump into it with both feet. Dollar-cost averaging is the smartest strategy. The good news is that we're in a new bull market, which could be good news for Bitcoin if that optimism flows into crypto.\n\nThe critical thing to focus on is Bitcoin's return potential over the long term.\n\nAs you can see, Bitcoin has crushed the broader stock market despite huge swings that put investors through stomach-turning declines:\n\nThat doesn't guarantee future returns, of course, but Bitcoin has been around long enough to give investors a solid history to look back on and learn from. The great thing about Bitcoin is how structured it is. It operates the same way it always has and will continue that way in the future.\n\nAs long as investors and users continue to want Bitcoin, the halving and the slowing inflow of new Bitcoins to the market could continue supporting market-beating price growth."

        "title": "Crypto Mining Consumes a Mind-Boggling 2% of U.S. Electricity - Heatmap",
        "content": "Just how much electricity does cryptocurrency mining use? It could be over 2% of all electricity in the United States, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Energy Information Administration. More specifically, \u201cannual electricity use from cryptocurrency mining probably represents from 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.\u201d\n\nUsing data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance on Bitcoin, specifically, the EIA estimated that, at least as of January 2022, almost 38% of all Bitcoin mining was occurring in the U.S., which let it produce a range of estimates for Bitcoin mining\u2019s electricity usage, ranging from 25 terawatt-hours to 91 terawatt-hours \u2014 about the same amount of electricity consumed by around 3 million to around 6 million homes \u2014 or roughly the electricity consumption of Utah or West Virginia. That wide range is due to the imprecise nature of the measurements, which are based on how active a crypocurrency mining operation would be based on the price of Bitcoin and other factors. Global electricity consumption based on these estimates, the EIA said, was \u201cabout the same as total electricity consumption in Greece or Australia.\u201d\n\nSo why is Bitcoin so power hungry?\n\nIn some deep sense, Bitcoin is electricity. The cryptocurrency is \u201cmined\u201d \u2014 i.e. new Bitcoins are generated \u2014 through what\u2019s called a proof of work system, essentially a way of proving that a computer (or, in reality, lots of computers) have done a lot of computation. This computational work maintains the system as a whole, and thus the new Bitcoins are a reward for doing this decentralized maintenance. (Lots of other cryptocurrencies also use a proof of work system the mint new coins, the notable exception being Ethereum, which last year switched to what\u2019s called a \u201cproof of stake\u201d system that uses less energy. This, Ethereum leadership said, makes the blockchain \u201cgreen.\u201d)\n\nAll that computation is incredibly energy intensive, which is why we see crypto miners glom onto sources of cheap energy. Sometimes the cheapest energy they can use is not using energy at all \u2014 Bitcoin mines in Texas are part of a demand management program run by the state\u2019s electricity market, ERCOT, where they can collect hefty payments for not operating when electricity demand is high.\n\nThis energy consumption is a frequent point of criticism for advocates, activists, and lawmakers who are skeptical of cryptocurrency and earlier this week, the EIA said it would start collecting its own data on cryptocurrency mining.\n\nSo far, the EIA has found 137 cryptocurrency mining facilities, with several of the largest ones located in Texas. But this was just done by scanning publicly available data. The EIA said earlier this week that it will be conducting a \u201cmandatory survey\u201d to better understand crypto\u2019s energy demands."

        "content": "Ionic Digital, a bitcoin mining company spun up as a part of Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy plan, is now operational.\n\nCelsius emerged from bankruptcy Wednesday, distributing $3 billion in cryptoassets to creditors in the process, according to a press release.\n\nIonic will run 127,000 bitcoin mining machines across five sites in Texas. The mining rigs were purchased under former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, who is currently awaiting trial for fraud. The new company will seek a public listing and issue shares to Celsius creditors hoping to recoup their lost funds.\n\nCelsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022 after being caught in the liquidity crisis that followed the UST stablecoin\u2019s sudden collapse. Since then, the Celsius estate has shuffled around its sizable crypto holdings and hammered out a plan to repay its more than 100,000 creditors.\n\nRead more: SEC sues Celsius, former CEO for market manipulation, securities fraud\n\nA bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York approved in November a plan allowing Celsius creditors to receive a combination of crypto and stock in the new bitcoin mining enterprise. The implementation was finalized in late December.\n\nIonic Digital received Celsius\u2019 mining rigs and $225 million to ramp up operations. The company is helmed by Matt Prusak, a former US Bitcoin Corp executive who more recently worked at Hut 8 after a merger between the two mining firms.\n\nIncoming CEO of Ionic Digital Matt Prusak\n\nPer an agreement with the Celsius estate, Hut 8 will be paid equity plus a $20 million annual management fee over four years to assist with Ionic\u2019s mining operations. In an interview with Blockworks, Prusak said he has no plans to leave Ionic after Hut 8\u2019s contract runs out.\n\nRead more: Crypto Hiring: Hut 8 exec set to take over Celsius mining company\n\nCelsius creditors will become shareholders in Ionic Digital, which aims to become a publicly traded company in the near future. Prusak said the share distribution is in process but declined to give a specific timeline.\n\nIt\u2019s an unconventional way to start a mining company, but running a company owned by Celsius creditors has its benefits. The new CEO steps into a role where his brand new company is well-capitalized, has no debt and could immediately have tens of thousands of shareholders.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m embracing the uniqueness of the situation,\u201d Prusak said, adding that he hopes to become a leader in the bitcoin mining space and help the industry mature. Prusak said some Celsius creditors had reached out with messages of support, and he hopes to engage more with his company\u2019s shareholders in the future.\n\nPrusak said the number of Ionic Digital employees was not yet finalized but it would be a small team. Several times throughout the interview, he emphasized that Ionic is independent from the Celsius Network.\n\nIonic Digital launches amid significant headwinds for the bitcoin mining industry. Mining stocks have seen a broad 2024 sell-off, particularly following the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. Hut 8 fell 44% in January. Things aren\u2019t slated to get easier, with reduced mining rewards caused by the bitcoin halving looming in April.\n\nStill, Ionic Digital furthers the hope that creditors to Celsius \u2014 some of whom lost significant sums \u2014 could be made whole.\n\n\u201cCrypto has had a lot of challenging stories and folks who have lost money in various ways,\u201d Prusak said. \u201cWe had a wave of challenged companies in the sector and our efforts are part of that rebirth.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Regardless of any short-term pullback, Bitcoin will spend this year further cementing its reputation as digital gold. Indeed, just as it did in March 2023 during a narrowly avoided banking crisis, BTC will likely hold up in ways many traditional assets \u2014 perhaps even gold \u2014 fail to.\n\nIt is true that the grand institutional entry into Bitcoin has not lit up the markets as some might have hoped, and it probably won\u2019t for a while yet. Much of this event was already baked into prices and there are few investors that saw the SEC's reluctant capitulation as any kind of ringing endorsement of cryptocurrency.\n\nRelated: An Ethereum ETF is coming sooner than you expect\n\nNonetheless, BlackRock's ETF has already hoovered up $2 billion in assets as others follow fast in the rear, providing a level of support never before seen for the world\u2019s biggest digital currency. The day is soon coming, infact, that we all reminisce about the good old days of BTC volatility.\n\nIn the meantime, though, we will almost certainly see a pullback in the face of global economic pressures. Chief among these is the resurgence of inflation in the US, which has dashed hopes for a rate cut before Q2, and which will likely continue to be exacerbated by rising tensions in the Middle East and an ongoing war in Europe.\n\nOn top of this, we have the end of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) coming up on March 11. The saving grace of U.S. banks during last year\u2019s almost-crisis, this may well reveal some further shaky foundations that could again spook markets into a significant sell-off.\n\nEven more significant than all this, though, we have a growing global sovereign debt pile. Now standing at $91 trillion, this stone around the neck of global economies is continuing to put pressure on fiat currencies and bond markets all over the world, with the IMF increasingly citing concerns about public debt sustainability.\n\nGlobal debt trend. Source: International Monetary Fund\n\nWhile Bitcoin may initially wobble with global markets in the face of these pressures, though, as a finite resource that is transparent, immutable and decentralized, its long-term concept value will continue to grow and this will support prices in the medium to long term. In-fact this year we could truly see Bitcoin become a North Star for the global economy \u2014 if not in exactly the way the Bitcoin maxis had hoped.\n\nUltimately, however, we are unlikely to see any major Black Swan economic events this year. Not only are we facing a presidential election in the U.S., but several others across the world \u2014 with seven out of 10 of the world\u2019s most populous nations (equating to around half the global population) hitting the polls over the next 10 months.\n\nRelated: 3 bull market narratives for 2024 that you haven\u2019t heard about yet\n\nAs such, while there isn\u2019t the economic wriggle room to offer the rate cuts and huge spending sprees that many politicians might like, we can bank on policymakers pulling out all the stops to avert any kind of crisis \u2014 especially in the banking sector. In the U.S., we will see some new packages to support banks while the real estate market will also likely win some attention.\n\nAs such, we won\u2019t see Bitcoin \u2014 or indeed any market \u2014 staying down for very long this year. Rather, after an initial pullback on global economic concerns and some reserved trading around sustained interest rates, we will \u2014 in my personal opinion \u2014 see BTC rebound and surpass $50,000 in the second quarter before taking off into the oncoming bull market.\n\nPrices and sentiment have been subdued for too long and risk appetite has returned to crypto, if not global markets at large. And if all those politicians want to win any votes, they will need to make sure that it stays that way.\n\nStefan Rust is the CEO of Truflation.com, which tracks real-time data across networks, markets, and feeds to provide financial and economic data on-chain.

With the price of bitcoin reaching $43,500 on Tuesday, this could be the largest ever crypto seizure by German authorities, Saxony prosecutors said.\n\nOne of the suspects voluntarily transferred the bitcoin to the wallet of the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) \u201cto make up for the damage.\u201d The money will remain in the BKA\u2019s crypto account until a court determines how it will be used, prosecutors said.\n\nThe police did not disclose the name of the website in their latest press release, but it was identified during a 2020 investigation as Movie2k, \u201cthe most popular German streaming platform for pirated movies.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2008, Movie2k distributed over 880,000 copies of pirated films. It was among the most-visited websites in Germany at that time. Its administrators earned money through advertising fees and subscriptions.\n\nThe police suspect that a 40-year-old German citizen and a 37-year-old Polish citizen acquired the bitcoin with revenues from the website until it was shut down in 2013.\n\nOne of the Movie2k operators, who cooperated with the police and agreed to transfer his crypto, is a programmer and real estate entrepreneur from Berlin. He has been in custody since November 2019, suspected of commercial money laundering. In 2020, the whereabouts of the second operator are unknown.\n\nThe ongoing investigation, supported by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), focuses on the illegal sharing of copyrighted work and money laundering.\n\n\u201cAll further information will be provided once the investigation is completed,\u201d the police said. According to Patrick Pintaske, the spokesman for the public prosecutor's office in Dresden, as of yet no charges have been brought against the suspects.\n\nCryptocurrency is often used by criminals to store and transfer substantial sums of money stolen from victims. Currently, the U.S. government stands as one of the world's largest holders of crypto assets seized from cybercriminals and darknet markets, having confiscated almost 200,000 bitcoins, valued at more than $8 billion, since 2020."

        "content": "A recent breakthrough moment for Bitcoin marks the start of a new era for the cryptocurrency, but analyst Ben Hertz-Shargel warns that its staggering energy demands risk destabilising power grids and wiping out green energy gains.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission this month approved the first US-listed exchange traded funds to track Bitcoin, making it much easier to trade and opening the door to a whole new class of prospective investors.\n\nThis is all very exciting for Bitcoin enthusiasts, says Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, but it comes with a problem: the news will likely spark a boom in the staggeringly energy-intensive mining process that underlies the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin requires so much energy because the decentralised blockchain structure it uses employs a system where to verify transactions computers must guess at a 64-digit string of numbers and letters, with trillions of possible options. Computers all over the world race to guess the string and the fastest not only certifies the transaction but is also rewarded in Bitcoin \u2013 hence, \u2018mining\u2019 it.\n\nFor context, cryptocurrency mining, which Bitcoin represents the vast majority of, used a fifth as much electricity in 2022 as global centralised data computing and data transmission combined.\n\n\u201cThat is stunning,\u201d said Hertz-Shargel, as it means that cryptocurrency mining is using a fifth of \u201call of the fruits of the internet revolution, industrial revolution, the cloud and AI industrial revolution.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below the advert\n\nPut another way, \u201cit is consuming at a level that is on par with everything else that has come out of modern technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is to me a completely incommensurate cost.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Hertz-Shargel said that Bitcoin mining now uses up to 75% more electricity than it did back then.\n\nOne of the most recent estimates is that Bitcoin mining uses around 127TWh of electricity annually \u2013 around the same as Norway.\n\nMuch like tech giants, Bitcoin miners often develop their own data centres to run their operations, and many have flooded to Texas to set up facilities due to the US state's abundant wind and solar farms.\n\nHowever, Hertz-Shargel said that while Bitcoin miners often site their operations next to renewables facilities \u2013 claiming they are \u2018sustainable\u2019 as a result \u2013 this is very different to data centres run by Big Tech companies that run off renewables.\n\nThe \u201ccritical difference\u201d is that Big Tech companies such as Amazon and Microsoft sign power purchase agreements with renewables developers, prompting new wind and solar farms to get built.\n\n\u201cNo Bitcoin mines are doing that,\u201d he said.\n\n'Chequered past'\n\nPart of the problem is that the modern Bitcoin mining industry has been around for less time than the duration of many green power offtake agreements, he said.\n\nCombine that with the volatile price of cryptocurrency and the \u201cchequered past\u201d of many Bitcoin miners and Hertz-Shargel said it is \u201cvery doubtful\u201d that renewables developers will want to get into bed with the industry as a partner.\n\nInstead, Bitcoin data centres are syphoning off green energy that could be used elsewhere, he said. \u201cThe direct effect is causing high cost, high emissions generators to be run much more often.\u201d\n\nHertz-Shargel said that, despite popular belief that Bitcoin miners stop operations at periods of peak demand, many run almost constantly, and are at times pushing the grid \u201ccloser to a brownout.\u201d\n\nIn a global context, this could mean that the boom in the rollout of renewables risks being in some part cancelled out by a parallel boom in the energy demands of Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe energy transition is all about tradeoffs,\u201d said Hertz-Shargel \u201cWe have a finite grid, a finite amount of clean energy that we can deploy in a realistic period of time.\u201d The question \u201cyou have to ask yourself\u201d is therefore \u201cwhat can we afford to power via the grid?\u201d"

        "content": "In this article\n\nJanuary 2009 \u2013 July 2013: Bitcoin gets started\n\nAugust 2013 \u2013 December 2017: Bitcoin draws in the public\n\nJanuary 2018 \u2013 December 2020: Bitcoin recovers and soars\n\nJanuary 2021 \u2013 December 2023: Bitcoin gets hit by regulations and rising rates\n\nJanuary 2024: Bitcoin ETFs debut\n\nBitcoin returns by year\n\nCaret Down Caret Up\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has been on a roller coaster ride since it first debuted in January 2009, but the long-term trajectory has been higher \u2013 \u201cup and to the right,\u201d as they say. Bitcoin ushered in the age of cryptocurrency, but it took quite a while before the public sat up and took notice.\n\nStill, in little more than a decade, cryptocurrency, and in particular, Bitcoin, has become one of the most exciting trading opportunities in a long time. Bitcoin trading has created millionaires, though given that persistent rise since its debut, plenty of traders would have done fine just holding \u2013 or HODLing \u2013 on for the ride, as many long-term bullish owners have done.\n\nDespite the long-term rise, Bitcoin has been dogged by periods where it\u2019s fallen precipitously. The most recent has been from November 2021 through 2022, when the prospect of rising interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets sent Bitcoin\u2019s price much lower.\n\nBitcoin was unleashed in the months after the global financial crisis obliterated economies. It was created by a mysterious individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, and early proponents touted the currency\u2019s promise of moving monetary policy out of the hands of governments and central banks and into an autonomously managed system.\n\nBitcoin famously has a maximum of 21 million coins that can ever be created. In the face of this fixed supply, an ever-increasing demand can send the cryptocurrency soaring. Given these dynamics, speculators have rushed into the space to take advantage of the anticipated price appreciation.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is notoriously driven by sentiment. When the market shifts to its \u201cgreed\u201d phase, Bitcoin soars amid the utopian promises and speculators dismiss the risks of an asset that generates no cash flow. In the \u201cfear\u201d phase, Bitcoin\u2019s price seems to find no traction, as sellers push its price lower amid bad news or general market malaise.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid all of this speculation, however, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin is tough to use for everyday purchases. Major companies that introduced ways to pay with Bitcoin have quietly walked back those initiatives. Now the market has rewritten the narrative from Bitcoin as a medium of exchange to one where it\u2019s a store of value, \u201cdigital gold.\u201d However, gold has a few thousand years of history as a store of value, compared to little more than a dozen for Bitcoin.\n\nHere\u2019s how the price of Bitcoin has risen and fallen over time as well as some of the trends driving those moves.\n\nJanuary 2009 \u2013 July 2013: Bitcoin is created and attracts techies\n\nThe New Liberty Standard Exchange recorded the first exchange of Bitcoin for dollars in late 2009. Users on the BitcoinTalk forum traded 5,050 bitcoins for $5.02 via PayPal, making the first price mediated through an exchange a bargain basement price of $0.00099 per bitcoin. In other words, the price was about one-tenth of one cent.\n\nWhile Bitcoin was officially launched on January 3, 2009, it\u2019s tough to find any standard pricing before mid-2010. That\u2019s because there weren\u2019t exchanges in the same way that there are today. However, data became available in July 2010 and continues to this day.\n\nIt was in 2010 that the most expensive pizzas of all time were purchased. One Bitcoin owner offered 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas, an offer that continues to live on in Bitcoin lore. It\u2019s considered the first time that anyone used virtual currency to buy something in the real world.\n\nAccording to historical data at Investing.com, Bitcoin\u2019s price never broke above $0.40 per bitcoin in 2010 but did manage to hit that level in early 2011. Then in February, it crossed $1. Just a few months later, in May, it briefly exceeded $8 \u2013 a stunning 8-bagger in mere months!\n\nBy June 2011, Bitcoin\u2019s price had hit nearly $30, a seemingly unimaginable rise from just months before. And that\u2019s where it topped out for the year. Bitcoin spent the remainder of 2011 just dwindling to as low as $2, before finishing the year at $4.70. After this bubble burst and a more than 90 percent fall from its all-time high, it might have seemed as if the Bitcoin fad was over.\n\nIn 2012, Bitcoin spent much of the year consolidating, slowly growing stronger throughout the year. In November 2012, Bitcoin went through its first \u201chalving,\u201d a change in the reward structure for miners, where they receive half as many bitcoins for mining blocks on the blockchain. As 2012 came to an end, Bitcoin finished at $13.50, just off the highs for the year.\n\nThat consolidation set up Bitcoin for a strong run in 2013 when it began to attract more notice outside a niche audience of techies and hobbyists. The world\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver, allowing buyers to change fiat money for crypto. By the end of January, Bitcoin\u2019s price had already risen to more than $20. The momentum built from there, as interest spread.\n\nBy early March, Bitcoin had already doubled again, rising to more than $40. A couple of weeks later it surpassed $50, and then days later $60. It climbed to $70 the day after that. By the start of April 2013, Bitcoin had passed $100 in breathtaking fashion. Then eight days later it spiked to $230!\n\nFrom there, it was just a week until Bitcoin was back at $68, as the bottom fell out. But then a week later, it had doubled again and traded north of $150. After the strong trading action in April and May, Bitcoin spent June and July settling down. Surely this was the peak of insanity for Bitcoin volatility.\n\nAugust 2013 \u2013 December 2017: Bitcoin breaks through to popular consciousness\n\nAfter months of consolidating from its rise earlier in the year, Bitcoin reached new heights in November 2013. Priced at $213 entering the month, Bitcoin doubled to nearly $435 just 12 days later. By the end of the month, it had nearly tripled from there, up to more than $1,200, before ending the year at $805, a real downdraft, but still up from just $541 a couple of weeks before. Late in the year, the People\u2019s Bank of China banned financial institutions from using bitcoins.\n\nThe year 2014 saw Bitcoin retain its signature volatility. After hitting $1,000 in early January, Bitcoin bottomed at $111.60 on Feb. 21 \u2013 a decline approaching 90 percent! Behind the turbulence were problems at Mt. Gox, one of the earliest crypto exchanges. The exchange had stopped withdrawals, then filed for bankruptcy after losing 744,400 bitcoins of users\u2019 funds.\n\nThen a mere five days later, Bitcoin recorded a price of $593.10 \u2013 more than a 5-bagger in days! Bitcoin spent the rest of the year gradually declining and closed 2014 at about $318.\n\nThe year 2015 started with Bitcoin declining, but most of the year was a slow uptrend, unusual for Bitcoin, and it ended the year at $430. In November, the official Bitcoin B symbol was adopted.\n\nThe first half of 2016 continued the same, with relatively muted volatility and price consolidation. But by the end of May, the price was picking up and by mid-June, Bitcoin was hitting $700. It didn\u2019t last, though, and Bitcoin was back in the $600s until November 2016. It peaked back over $700 and then quickly $800 and $900. As the year ended, Bitcoin was flirting with $1,000, a level it broke through in early 2017, a watershed year for Bitcoin when it came to national awareness.\n\nThe year 2017 started off slowly enough, with Bitcoin wavering between $1,000 and $1,200. But by late April, the digital currency was clearly moving higher. The end of May saw Bitcoin at $2,300, but despite a move higher, it was back below $2,000 by mid-July. The decline didn\u2019t last. By mid-August, Bitcoin had powered through $4,000 and then much higher. Retail traders were suddenly aware of the cryptocurrency and were driving volumes and prices higher.\n\nIn September, Bitcoin consolidated around $4,000 before moving decisively higher to $5,000 and then $6,000 in mid-October. The price of $7,000 was breached on Nov. 2, and then Bitcoin spent the rest of the year melting up: A couple of weeks later Bitcoin passed $8,000, then $10,000, surging to $13,000 days later, eclipsing $16,000 and by mid-December topping out above $19,000.\n\nIn December, Bitcoin futures began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, helping drive further interest and dollars to the cryptocurrency.\n\nIt was a perilously quick rise for Bitcoin that became self-sustaining. As the news spread, more people rushed in to buy, sending the price seemingly ever higher. But Bitcoin finished the year off its highest levels, ending the breakthrough year of 2017 at $13,850.\n\nJanuary 2018 \u2013 December 2020: Bitcoin recovers and soars even higher\n\nAfter the huge melt-up of 2017, Bitcoin spent most of 2018 in a downtrend, falling throughout the year, following a brief surge to start the year. By the end of the first quarter, Bitcoin was down nearly 50 percent from where it had started the year. It spent much of the year bouncing between $6,000 and $8,000 before closing 2018 at $3,709 \u2013 down 73 percent for the year.\n\nThe year 2019 kicked off with more of the same, as Bitcoin looked for direction. It tried to burst through $4,000 for the first few months, but finally hit it in April and then rose to $5,000. May came and Bitcoin reached $6,000, then $7,000, then $8,000 before settling back in early June. That month Bitcoin swiftly spiked to $13,000 before coming back.\n\nBy September, Bitcoin was back solidly under $10,000, and it continued to search for direction and fell until the end of the year, finishing out 2019 at just under $7,200.\n\nBut with the turn of the calendar to 2020, Bitcoin picked up, rising over the next six weeks to above $10,000. In the midst of the stock market downturns during the initial COVID pandemic wave, Bitcoin wavered, falling to $8,000. Then during the drawdown, it plummeted on March 12, 2020 \u2013 from $7,935 to $4,826 in a single day, a decline of more than 39 percent!\n\nBy early April, it was back above $7,000, then $8,000 and finally began pushing $10,000 in May. After dawdling for a couple of months, it finally rose to more than $11,000 in July and $12,000 in August. It settled over the next few months, until October, when it pushed through $13,000 again and ultimately vaulted to nearly $20,000 in November 2020, as financial markets tore higher on liquidity from the Federal Reserve and the prospect of a COVID vaccine.\n\nBitcoin raced higher during December 2020 and closed out the year at $28,949.\n\nJanuary 2021 \u2013 December 2023: Bitcoin gets pressured\n\nAfter what can only be described as a thrilling end of 2020 for Bitcoin, the digital currency started 2021 with a bang. The cryptocurrency climbed to start the year, peaking above $64,000 by mid-April, following a strong first quarter. Promises of seemingly never-ending liquidity from the Federal Reserve gave markets \u2013 both crypto and stocks \u2013 unbridled optimism.\n\nAfter this auspicious start to the year, there seemed to be only one place to go: down. In May, China warned cryptocurrency buyers that it was going to put pressure on the industry, and the price of Bitcoin began to drop. The country also announced that it was prohibiting financial institutions and payment platforms from transacting in cryptocurrency.\n\nThis news helped throw Bitcoin into a tailspin, where it quickly lost more than 50 percent of its value within a few months.\n\nLater, in September, China announced that all cryptocurrency transactions were illegal and that even foreign websites offering such services to Chinese traders were prohibited. The market shrugged off that news, and by October the currency was back over $60,000 and on its way to a new all-time high, at $68,789, on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nLate in 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin to taper its bond purchases, slowly draining liquidity from financial markets. With inflation roaring at multi-decade highs, the central bank wanted to tamp down rising prices. The 10-year Treasury rate began to rise, as investors began pricing in the prospect that the Fed would raise interest rates in the near future.\n\nThe prospect of less liquidity in the market threw risky assets such as high-growth stocks for a loop, and cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin followed along, starting in early November.\n\nThat malaise continued into 2022, as rising inflation and a central bank intent on raising rates to thwart it, drove investors from risky assets. Bitcoin bounced around the $40,000 mark for months, but as the Fed started to aggressively raise interest rates in March, it began to sink. In mid-2022, Bitcoin established a new trading range of around $20,000 but then sank to less than $16,000 as high-profile blow-ups such as FTX hurt traders\u2019 confidence.\n\nThe price picked up in 2023, gaining more than 50 percent through mid-June, amid a broader rally in tech stocks. Bitcoin traded for around $26,000 as of mid-June 2023 despite a crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the crypto industry. It bounced around but was still near $27,000 by late September, before it began to break higher to end the year.\n\nAs interest rates seemed to be peaking in October 2023, Bitcoin started rising again. It ran to more than $42,000 to close out the year, amid rumors that the SEC would finally allow the creation of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nJanuary 2024: Bitcoin ETFs debut\n\nAfter some months of speculation, the SEC officially permitted Bitcoin to be traded in an ETF, and 11 fund managers were allowed to list funds. Bitcoin ETFs then began trading on January 11, 2024. Bitcoin peaked at nearly $49,000 in the days leading up to the announcement, but cooled somewhat in the weeks following.\n\nBitcoin returns by year\n\nYear Return 2009 N/A 2010 30,203%* 2011 1,467% 2012 187% 2013 5,870% 2014 -61% 2015 35% 2016 124% 2017 1,338% 2018 -73% 2019 94% 2020 302% 2021 60% 2022 -64% 2023 156%\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.

        "title": "How Much Power Does Crypto Use? The Government Wants to Know - CNET",
        "content": "Think if you don't buy bitcoin, the whole cryptocurrency craze doesn't affect you? Think again.\n\nGlobally, crypto mining uses as much electricity as the Netherlands, and all that energy use has serious climate implications.\n\nBeyond that, studies indicate it could be raising the price you pay for electricity.\n\nExactly how much energy is used to mine crypto in the US, and how it's affecting the energy system at large, isn't super clear. One US government agency is trying to figure that out.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, which tracks and reports on energy use, announced it plans to start collecting data on electricity use by crypto miners in the US. In February, the agency will start surveying crypto mining companies, which will have to respond with details of their energy use.\n\n\"We intend to continue to analyze and write about the energy implications of cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States,\" EIA Administrator Joe DeCarolis said in a statement Wednesday. \"We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.\"\n\nStudies have shown crypto mining operations can raise the utility bills of people who live around them, but this is a relatively new and fast-changing issue. Here's what it all means.\n\nCrypto mining uses a lot of electricity\n\nAnyone who writes about crypto's energy use is obliged to compare it to a country. The University of Cambridge's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index estimated worldwide bitcoin mining used 121.13 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2023. The entire country of the Netherlands, with more than 17 million people, consumed 121.6 terawatt-hours in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nWhy so much electricity? Essentially, crypto tokens are generated by having a computer solve complicated puzzles. That requires a lot of computing power, generally done by specialized computers running calculations 24 hours a day. All those computers generate a lot of heat, which means these facilities usually have energy-intensive cooling systems.\n\nNot all crypto tokens are quite as energy intensive as bitcoin. Ethereum made a significant change in 2022 (called the Merge) that significantly reduced its energy requirements.\n\nFor bitcoin in particular, the energy demand tends to rise when higher prices for the token itself encourages miners to produce more. After dropping well below $20,000 at the end of 2022, the price of bitcoin is now back above $40,000 -- driving up demand. Cambridge's index now estimates a year of energy demand at the current pace at nearly 165 terawatt-hours.\n\nIn a memo outlining the need for the new EIA survey, DeCarolis noted the surging price of bitcoin as a reason for more analysis of the industry's energy use.\n\n\"At the time of this writing, much of the central United States is in the grip of a major cold snap that has resulted in high electricity demand,\" he wrote. \"The combined effects of increased cryptomining and stressed electricity systems create heightened uncertainty in electric power markets, which could result in demand peaks that affect system operations and consumer prices, as happened in Plattsburgh, New York, in 2018. Such conditions can materialize and dissipate rapidly.\"\n\nWhy crypto's energy consumption matters\n\nAll this power demand has ripple effects through the energy ecosystem. Consider first where the US gets its electricity. The biggest source of power is natural gas, at roughly 39% of net generation in 2022, according to the EIA. Another roughly 20% came from coal. The burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas for power are major contributors to climate change, and the total generation from renewable sources like wind and solar amounted to just 21.3% of US generation in 2022.\n\nCrypto's growing thirst for electrical power comes amid a push for electrification across sectors in a bid to wean the world off fossil fuels. The grid also faces pressure from things like electric vehicles and all-electric heating and cooling systems.\n\nThe serious electrical demand from crypto mining can also cause fluctuations in prices, as DeCarolis noted. A study released in 2023 by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago calculated crypto mining led households in upstate New York to pay an extra $88 per year in utility bills per year.\n\nWhile increasing demand from crypto mining can affect anyone's electricity bills, it can have more immediate impacts if you have an electricity rate that changes with demand. In other cases, it can lead to more frequent blackouts if the grid isn't able to meet demand.\n\nThe EIA's justification for the survey also pointed specifically at the effects of crypto mining's energy use during moments when the grid is under strain, such as extreme weather like winter cold snaps or summer heat waves.\n\nThere are ways to insulate yourself from any changes in the energy market. One way, if you live in a state where you can choose an energy plan, is to consider longer-term, fixed-rate plans.\n\nYou can also consider getting solar panels or a home battery. Solar panels allow you to be your own electricity source, independent of prices on the market. A battery can be used to store energy when it's cheap so you can use it when prices increase. Batteries can also provide you with power during blackouts if the grid goes down."

        "content": "A 2023 research report from ARK Invest highlights Bitcoin\u2019s historical outperformance of major assets and suggests an institutional portfolio allocation as high as 19.4% to maximize risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe investment management firm published its annual report on Jan. 31, which presents various research findings focused on the technological convergence of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, energy storage and robotics.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin is now a \u2018public good\u2019 \u2014 ARK Invest president\n\nA significant portion of the report is focused on Bitcoin (BTC) portfolio allocation, the performance of the preeminent cryptocurrency since its inception and a more focused perspective on its metrics over the past three years.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s long-term performance\n\nARK presents data that reflects Bitcoin\u2019s superior performance against other major traditional investment assets over longer time frames. Over the past seven years, Bitcoin\u2019s annualized return averaged 44%, while other major assets averaged 5.7%.\n\nA comparison of Bitcoin\u2019s annualized returns against major asset classes. Source: ARK Invest\n\nThe analysts note that Bitcoin investors with \u201clong-term time horizons\u201d have benefitted from holding the asset for extended periods. The report contends that Bitcoin\u2019s historical volatility can obfuscate long-term returns due to short-term rises and falls in value:\n\n\u201cInstead of \u2018when,\u2019 the better question is \u2018for how long?\u2019 Historically, investors who bought and held bitcoin for at least 5 years have profited, no matter when they made their purchases.\u201d\n\nARK\u2019s research delves into the volatility and return profiles of traditional asset classes and suggests that a portfolio aiming for maximized risk-adjusted returns would have allocated 19.4% to Bitcoin in 2023.\n\nRelated: ARK Invest files for Bitcoin ETF registration alongside industry peers\n\nThis has changed significantly over the past decade. ARK notes that on a five-year rolling basis, an allocation to Bitcoin would have maximized risk-adjusted returns since 2015:\n\n\u201cAccording to our analysis, in 2015, the optimal allocation to maximize risk-adjusted returns on a 5-year time horizon would have been 0.5%. Since then, on the same basis, the average allocation to Bitcoin would have been 4.8%, and in 2023 alone, 19.4%.\u201d\n\n$2.3 million per Bitcoin?\n\nARK\u2019s research also considers a hypothetical situation where institutional investments from the $250 trillion global investable asset base follow its 19.4% Bitcoin portfolio allocation.\n\nThree potential Bitcoin valuations considering global institutional investment into BTC at 1%, 4.8% and 19.4%. Source: ARK Invest\n\nIf the global asset base invested just 1% of assets, Bitcoin\u2019s price could reach $120,000 per BTC. If the global investment base allocated the 4.8% average maximum Sharpe ratio from 2015 to 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s price would reach $550,000. Following ARK\u2019s 19.4% allocation, Bitcoin would be valued at a staggering $2.3 million per coin.\n\nChanging Bitcoin investment narratives\n\nARK\u2019s research considers a wealth of empirical market data to arrive at its 19.4% Bitcoin allocation to maximize risk-adjusted returns. In previous years, its prescribed allocation was more in tune with other prominent investment analysts and experts.\n\nIn January 2022, Ray Dalio echoed the sentiments of billionaire investor Bill Miller that a portfolio allocation of 1% to 2% into Bitcoin was an optimal figure. A year earlier, investment strategists at JPMorgan suggested that a 1% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin would serve as a hedge against fluctuations in traditional asset classes such as stocks, bonds and commodities.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?"

        "content": "\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nThe cryptocurrency market traded in the deep red on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve commentary added to doubts over early rate cuts.The Federal Reserve committee's decision to hold rates at 5.25-5.5% on Wednesday was no surprise, it took a dovish twist by emphasising that rates would not be cut until it had more confidence that inflation was truly beaten.In a media conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flatly stated a cut as early as March seemed unlikely, but also conceded that everyone on the committee was looking to ease this year.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 2.5% to around $1.69 trillion in the last 24 hours, as per data available on CoinGecko.At 10.16 a.m., Bitcoin was trading 2% lower at $42,093, while Ethereum was down 3.2% at $2,264. Another popular altcoin such as Solana and Avalanche fell over 5% each. While BNB XRP , Cardano, Donecoin, Chainlink, Polygon, and Shiba Inu also declined by 1-3%.Following the US Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates, Bitcoin slipped below the $43,000 mark as investors anticipated a potential rate cut in March, said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex.Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \"The Altcoin market also took a downturn which could change unless Ethereum breaches $2500 amid other positive macroeconomic factors.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $5.91 billion, 14.36% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $14.53 billion, which is 35.31% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per data available on CoinMarketCap.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, dropped to $824 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 54.42%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours surged 12.7% to $25.73 billion.\"Bitcoin's recent drop below $43,000 followed a hawkish stance by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, suggesting a March rate cut is unlikely. However, the broader economic environment favors Bitcoin in 2024 with expectations of a possible Fed rate cut, which traditionally boosts cryptocurrencies,\" said Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin.\"Additionally, expectations surrounding the April halving of Bitcoin and potential supportive US political and fiscal dynamics add to the bullish outlook. Despite the near-term uncertainty, Bitcoin's price trajectory is set for a potential rally to the low $50,000s, outweighing the prospect of a dip to the low $30,000s in the foreseeable future,\" Sathvik added."

        "title": "Is the Bitcoin Power Law model more realistic than Stock-to-Flow? - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Since finance YouTuber Andrei Jikh recently covered the so-called Bitcoin Power Model, there has been a notable debate within the Bitcoin community around its viability.\n\nJikh opened his video entitled \u201c2024 Bitcoin Price Prediction (CRAZY!)\u201d by stating,\n\n\u201cToday I want to show how a simple math rule that\u2019s able to predict patterns of the universe has also accurately tracked the last 15 years of Bitcoin\u2019s price, and I want to show you what this formula says Bitcoin should be worth 10 years from now.\u201d\n\nHe mentions a \u2018rule\u2019 based on a model that describes Bitcoin\u2019s price growth as following a power law principle over time. The model is based on the work of astrophysicist Giovanni Santostasi, who has analyzed 15 years of Bitcoin data.\n\nA power law is a statistical relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other, independent of the initial size of those quantities. This means that one quantity varies as a power of another. For example, if you double the length of a side of a square, the area will quadruple, demonstrating a power law relationship.\n\nJikh discusses how power laws have been used to predict various phenomena, including Bitcoin\u2019s price patterns. The video suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s price could potentially reach $200,000 in the next cycle and $1 million by 2033.\n\nThe significance of power laws in this context is that they allegedly allow for accurate predictions across different domains. In the case of Bitcoin, Santostasi claims they explain its price patterns with a high degree of accuracy, as indicated by a 95.3% accuracy based on regression analysis.\n\nIn a blog post from Jan. 12, Santostasi suggested renaming the model the BTC Scaling Law for reference.\n\nUnsurprisingly, comparisons with PlanB\u2019s Stock to Flow (S2F) quickly emerged as both models depict bullish scenarios for the world\u2019s leading digital asset. On Jan. 30, Santostasi shared a graph comparing the Power Law prediction for Bitcoin to S2F and commented,\n\n\u201cI wish S2F was true. But I rather count on a more realistic model that seems correct than on a model that is too optimistic and then to get disappointed. Also it is not good for BTC PR for the community to make these unrealistic claims. I don\u2019t think it is possible to get to tens of millions by 2033 (as S2F predicts). 1 M is already amazing (more realistic Power Law in time prediction).\u201d\n\nThere has been a sizeable debate on X regarding which model is more accurate. Some believe the S2F model has been invalidated along with the rainbow chart, while others assert that global adoption will activate a return to the trend.\n\nHowever, there has been little to discuss the other power law models used to analyze Bitcoin over time.\n\nOther power law models for Bitcoin.\n\nSantostasi is not the first to utilize power laws for Bitcoin analysis. In 2014, Alec MacDonell at the University of Notre Dame introduced the Log Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, which has been influential in understanding a Bitcoin bubble. This model focuses on asset price growth leading up to a crash.\n\nCentral to the LPPL model is the concept that Bitcoin\u2019s price growth follows an exponential trend relative to log-time. Essentially, a consistent percentage increase in time correlates with a proportional increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price. This model has proven useful in establishing critical support and resistance levels, guiding Bitcoin\u2019s upward price trajectory. Despite the model\u2019s predictive success, it\u2019s crucial to recognize its foundational assumption that Bitcoin\u2019s growth will continue to decelerate over time.\n\nIn 2019, Harold Christopher Burger built upon this foundation with the Power Law Oscillator (LPO), a tool designed to pinpoint optimal moments for Bitcoin investment, effectively predicting all four of Bitcoin\u2019s all-time highs. Notably, Santostasi suggests that Burger\u2019s PLO model was inspired by his own work from 2018, citing this Reddit thread. The thread includes Santostasi\u2019s model against Bitcoin at the time. In the top comment, the OP claimed that \u201cBTC will be around 150K in 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Power Law Oscillator gauges Bitcoin\u2019s relative valuation. With a range of 1 to -1, it signals whether Bitcoin is overpriced or underpriced at any given time. This tool\u2019s efficacy stems from its alignment with several key factors: historical data analysis, network value correlation, complex system dynamics, and resistance to traditional financial models.\n\nBitcoin price and power/scaling laws.\n\nWhen plotted on a log-log graph, Bitcoin\u2019s price trends reveal a power law relationship. A regression model based on this data can account for much of Bitcoin\u2019s price behavior, underscoring the model\u2019s predictive capabilities. The model resonates with Metcalfe\u2019s Law, which posits that a network\u2019s value is proportional to its users\u2019 square. This relationship has been validated in Bitcoin\u2019s case, especially over medium to long-term periods.\n\nThe prevalence of power laws in complex systems, such as urban growth and network development, suggests that Bitcoin, following a similar pattern, is more than a mere financial asset; it\u2019s a complex system in its own right. Bitcoin\u2019s unique characteristics, including its decentralization and detachment from traditional financial controls, render conventional currency models less effective. In contrast, the power law model offers an arguably more accurate representation of Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior.\n\nThe Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model offers a different yet complementary perspective. Popularized by an anonymous figure known as Plan B, this model assesses Bitcoin\u2019s value based on its scarcity, a concept intrinsic to commodities. The S2F model calculates the ratio of Bitcoin\u2019s total supply (stock) to its annual production rate (flow). This model\u2019s relevance is amplified by Bitcoin\u2019s predetermined supply schedule, characterized by halving events that reduce mining rewards and, thus, the flow, increasing the stock-to-flow ratio.\n\nThe S2F model gained significant attention, especially during the pandemic, as Bitcoin\u2019s price seemed to follow its predictions. However, this model focuses solely on the supply side, omitting demand, a vital component in price determination. Its predictions, sometimes reaching astronomical figures, have sparked debates in the financial community.\n\nWhile the S2F model provides a standardized measure of scarcity, helping compare Bitcoin with other scarce assets, it\u2019s essential to consider it as one of many factors in evaluating Bitcoin\u2019s investment potential. Market acceptance, technological advances, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic conditions are equally crucial in shaping Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nInterestingly, Santostasi\u2019s models are more conservative than other predictions. Many argue that Bitcoin is in the early phase of S-curve exponential growth. Santostasi rejects such models, stating that exponential growth on log charts is not feasible.\n\n\u201cBecause the middle part implies exponential growth given in a log linear chart a straight line is an exponential. BTC has never gone through an exponential growth (I mean the general trend), the bubbles are exponential.\u201d\n\nThus, while all of these models are used to predict Bitcoin\u2019s price, they differ in their specific methodologies and assumptions. The S2F model focuses on supply and demand, Santostasi\u2019s model uses regression analysis to predict future prices, MacDonell\u2019s LPPL model uses a calibration approach, and Burger\u2019s Power Law Oscillator is used chiefly as a technical analysis tool that varies over time within a particular band.\n\nIf the BTC Scaling Law (power law model) continues to be validated, Bitcoin\u2019s current value is closer to $60,000, and the next all-time high will be around March 2026, above $200,000."

        "content": "Bitcoin price hovers above the 2024 open at $42,479 and the 2024 POC at $42,643.\n\nBTC has a higher chance of resuming the uptrend after tagging the daily FVG, extending from $41,396 to $40,288.\n\nA breakdown of the weekly level at $39,851 will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price shot up 3% on Monday but has since undone most of the gains and currently trades around $42,762. But a few things need to happen before BTC shows its bullish hand and resumes the uptrend.\n\nAlso read: Week Ahead: Bitcoin price likely to support these altcoin narratives this week\n\nBitcoin price could reveal directional bias soon\n\nBitcoin price created the Monday\u2019s range, extending from $41,807 to $43,324. The most common trade idea is to short BTC after a sweep of Monday\u2019s high and book profits at Monday\u2019s low.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Week ly Forecast: As monthly close draws near, significance of $43,750 grows\n\nHere are a few key levels to watch if one is in this trade.\n\nThe highest traded volume level of 2024, aka the Point of Control (POC) at $42,643. The 2024 yearly open at $42,479. The midpoint of the previous bear market at $42,235.\n\nIn addition to these levels, the daily imbalance, extending from $41,396 to $40,288, is also a key area to watch. Imbalances or gaps are formed when the asset moves rapidly up or down due to inefficient order flow. These gaps are often revisited by the asset to rebalance and serve as support or resistance, depending on the type of imbalance.\n\nIn BTC\u2019s case, the imbalance was formed due to a spike in buying pressure, so a retracement into this area will be a good place for sidelined buyers to open a long position.\n\nWhile this short-term play shows promise of a quick upside, investors need to be mindful of the big picture as well. As mentioned in a previous publication, Bitcoin price needs to produce a daily candlestick close above $48,222 to sustain the uptrend outlook.\n\nSupporting the bullish outlook are the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Awesome Oscillator (AO) momentum indicators. The RSI has overcome the 50 mean level and is retesting it as a support, which is a bullish indication. The AO is close to flipping above the zero level, which shows a shift in momentum favoring bulls.\n\nIn such a case, Bitcoin price could easily overcome the $48,222 level and potentially retest the $50,000 psychological level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHowever, a potential spike in selling pressure that pushes Bitcoin price to slice through the $41,396 to $40,288 imbalance would denote a weak bullish camp. If this trend continues and leads to the production of a daily candlestick close below $39,851, it would produce a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis for BTC.\n\nIn such a case, a steeper correction could be anticipated by investors, as pointed out in a previous publication. The $34,067 and $32,293 support levels will be where the Bitcoin price would likely consolidate and rethink a bounce."

        "content": "The US Department of Energy (DOE) will begin collecting data on crypto mines\u2019 electricity use, following criticism from environmental advocates over how energy-hungry those operations are.\n\n\u201cWe will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand,\u201d Joe DeCarolis, administrator of the Energy Information Administration (EIA), said in a press release today.\n\n\u201cWe will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving.\u201d\n\nThe EIA, the statistical agency of the Department of Energy, announced that it is \u201cinitiating a provisional survey of electricity consumption information from identified cryptocurrency mining companies\u201d starting next week. The cryptocurrency mining companies will have to comply, per an \u201cemergency collection of data request\u201d the Office of Management and Budget authorized last week.\n\nGetting to this point has been a slog. After a ban on Bitcoin mining in China in 2021, the US became the world\u2019s biggest hub for Bitcoin mining. The mining boom raised flags for lawmakers and activists because of the energy demands of the process. Bitcoin mines managed to resurrect fossil fuel power plants and raise electricity costs for some residents in New York.\n\nIn 2022, Democratic lawmakers asked the biggest crypto mining companies in the US to disclose their electricity consumption and associated pollution. None of the companies responded with all the data they were asked to provide, and Congress subsequently asked the DOE and EPA to require that crypto companies publicly share the information.\n\nIn letters between the agencies and Democratic lawmakers shared exclusively with The Verge last year, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm wrote a letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) saying that the EIA has the authority to require crypto operations to report their energy use. Doing so would \u201crequire development of a new survey to collect this information,\u201d the letter says. It looks like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now. According to the letter, the EIA can potentially also require utilities to share information about how much electricity they sell to crypto companies."

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets.\u201d This includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through January 30, 2024)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price bounced back this week to $43,000 but is still down ~3% year to date.\n\nXRP\u2019s price inched down further and is currently down ~19% year to date.\n\nEther\u2019s price improved over this past week and is now practically flat year to date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch.\n\nOther ETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH).\n\nFor more news, information, and strategy, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Bull market truthers would say bitcoin bottomed out at the end of 2022 and we\u2019re destined for a parabolic run sometime after the next halving in April.\n\nThat would mean bitcoin has been in a bull market for more than a year. Not true.\n\nBitcoin has been in a kangaroo market for nearly as long.\n\nThe unpredictable kangaroo market hops sideways \u2014 sometimes aggressively \u2014 while bull and bear market trend consistently in one direction.\n\nNo doubt, a kangaroo market sounds familiar to anyone closely tracking the price of bitcoin over the past year.\n\nKangaroo markets were made famous by Berenberg strategist Jonathan Stubbs in the aftermath of the Covid market crashes in early 2020.\n\nThe S&P had folded almost 40% across February and March before an impressive bounce to new record highs in August.\n\nStocks would whipsaw over the next quarter \u2014 a potential outcome flagged by Stubbs in a research note months earlier.\n\nThe insight had been distilled into a viral meme after Stubbs appeared on a CNBC television segment.\n\nThe three animal spirits of financial markets (source)\n\nGranted, bitcoin has more than doubled since the end of 2022, which certainly sounds like a bull market.\n\nBut most of that action was a simple bounce from Terra\u2019s collapse and the subsequent rolling liquidations that triggered a string of bankruptcies, ultimately leading to the FTX scandal.\n\nOne month after Terra\u2019s implosion, Celsius, Three Arrows Capital and Voyager all went bust. Outside of the stress those collapses put on crypto markets, the Federal Reserve had just announced the biggest rate hikes in almost three decades, leading to widespread negative sentiment across both crypto and equities markets \u2014 heavily dragging prices.\n\nBitcoin changed hands for close to $30,000 in June 2022, a month which marked BTC\u2019s worst monthly candle in 11 years. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s outing as a multibillion-dollar fraudster triggered a further 20% fall in November, wiping the bulk of the previous bull run off the chart.\n\nBitcoin had totally shaken off the FTX crash by the end of January, and had properly reclaimed the $30,000 mark by March, even nearing its pre-Terra price point.\n\nRecovering from those debacles would signal the beginning of bitcoin\u2019s current kangaroo market: Bitcoin jumped around for the next eight months but went practically nowhere.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price often drops 20% in bull markets \u2014 but it\u2019s becoming less frequent\n\nIn fact, most of bitcoin\u2019s gains over the past year came directly after some very fake news. Bitcoin suddenly rallied 10% in October 2023 after Cointelegraph\u2019s X account claimed the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s ETF, when in fact no such decision would be made for months.\n\nOne might expect bitcoin would\u2019ve given up those gains once markets found out the post was wrong, as has happened in similar scenarios over the past few years.\n\nBitcoin did no such thing. It even rallied another 25% over the next few weeks \u2014 and then again by nearly one-third leading up to the real bitcoin ETF launch earlier this month. But bitcoin then proceeded to dump by up to 21% in a classic \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d event from which it\u2019s yet to fully recover. It has been hopping up and down ever since \u2014 like a kangaroo.\n\nMajor \u201csell the news\u201d events are earmarked by steady accumulation before a sudden crash after a highly anticipated date \u2014 and rarely say much about which type of market we\u2019re in.\n\nBitcoin is here, in a kangaroo market\n\nTo be clear, there are no formal definitions for \u201ckangaroo market\u201d (although \u201cbull\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d definitions are similarly vague).\n\nVIX, the benchmark volatility index for stocks, had just skyrocketed due to the Covid crashes when Berenberg\u2019s Stubbs popularized the term three years ago. Volatility kept relatively high for much of the following year, during which time the S&P 500 went mostly sideways \u2014 hence the whole kangaroo thing back in 2020.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historic volatility, meanwhile, has generally trended down over the past few years and hasn\u2019t seen any spikes on par with the VIX around Covid. Still, historical bitcoin volatility has now been rising since September.\n\nStubbs later explained that the kangaroo market had much to do with valuations being pulled from all sides: Downside risks outside of COVID such as tensions over Brexit, the Trump-Biden presidential race and strained US-China relations kept prices down, while bloated supply chains threatened revenues and flared credit risks across the global economy.\n\n\u201cBut then you have this historic support of central bank liquidity from what I call QE plus, which is a [combined support mechanism of] fiscal and monetary support. You have vaccine hopes coming through and let\u2019s not forget, we do have a pathway to recovery, albeit one with risk [\u2026]\n\nSo markets are kind of trapped in the middle and kangaroo along until we have this decisive break in either direction.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is likewise trapped right now: Spot bitcoin ETFs may have opened it up to previously untapped liquidity, but that has yet to convert to higher prices \u2014 even though BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise and others have collectively bought billions of dollars in bitcoin over the past three weeks.\n\nWhether they intended to or not, those funds (like the central banks in Stubbs\u2019 scenario) have played critical support at a time of major liquidation threats: The FTX estate was busy pulling $1 billion in bitcoin from Grayscale\u2019s flagship trust during the spot ETF\u2019s first week.\n\nTheoretically, those FTX flows could have contributed to even lower prices had the other spot funds not experienced billions in inflows on their own.\n\nLoading Tweet.. Bitcoin veteran Adam Back, like everyone else, wants to know how Mt. Gox repayments will impact prices\n\nNow, sometime over the next two months, Mt. Gox\u2019s estate is set to distribute upwards of 138,000 BTC ($5.87 billion) to nearly 130,000 creditors, who have been waiting a decade to receive their money back.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has multiplied by more than 50 times, leading to speculation that many would be eager to sell their bitcoin as soon as possible, pushing prices lower.\n\nMt. Gox payouts are set to come just ahead of the next halving, which cuts block rewards by 50% and radically shifts the economics of bitcoin mining.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin halving expected to hit on 4/20\n\nMining operations writ large may face stress tests should bitcoin fail to rally in the year or so after the halving, and especially so if bitcoin falls significantly from here. If that happens, miners could be inspired to sell some of their treasuries to make ends meet. Miners altogether hold about 10% of the circulating supply, equal to around $80 billion.\n\nAll this while US stocks firmly enter a bull market, with the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq 100 all hovering at record highs.\n\nBitcoin could soon be left wishing for even closer correlation with the US stock market if this kangaroo market keeps up.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.

        "content": "Ether is ready to take the limelight in the month ahead after bitcoin and newly launched bitcoin exchange-traded funds dominated crypto investor attention in January. Both bitcoin and ether are on pace to finish the month higher by 0.01%, according to Coin Metrics. January saw sharp price swings driven first by hype before the launch of the first spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and subsequent flows into and out of the funds after they began trading Jan. 11. By now, the outflows have tapered off and bitcoin's outlook for the year is still strong, boosted by the upcoming halving and the potential for rate cuts. As investors came to expect slow, steady flows into bitcoin through newly institutionalized ETFs in coming months, ether and altcoins have been ready for a breakout. \"Short-term flow has been dominated by GBTC [Grayscale Bitcoin] sales. \u2026 As that flow is easing, the market has found its footing and the reality of a world where large asset managers promote crypto actively is starting to hit home,\" said Darius Tabatabai, co-founder at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol. \"ETH and the alts are acting as high beta plays on this trend and our expectation is that both will outperform as more focus starts to direct towards ETH rolling out upgrades to [the Ethereum network] \u2026 as well as a potential ETF approval.\" February is a historically strong month for both bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin has finished nine of the last 11 Februarys in the green and has had an average return of 13.12% for the month, according to CoinGlass. Ether has finished the month higher in six of the last seven since its inception, giving it an average February gain of 12.97%. Soon after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin ETFs for trading, investors took profits and rotated into ether, pushing it to a 20-month high as they looked ahead to what might come next. The SEC is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale, which is seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. Standard Chartered said in a note this week that ahead of the May decision, it expects ether to track or outperform bitcoin's pre-ETF uptrend in the comparable period. If it does, it could reach $4,000 by then, the bank added, which would equal a roughly 70% increase from current levels. \"Bitcoin remains the more popular macro asset with cross-over appeal to traditional finance, and Solana is gaining popularity as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum,\" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Arca. \"Nonetheless, Ethereum is not going away anytime soon, and it could even compete with Bitcoin if an ETF is approved, or if bitcoin investors realize they want exposure to areas of blockchain's growth that Bitcoin doesn't offer, such as stablecoins, NFTs, [decentralized finance], gaming [and] AI.\" Ethereum is continually improving and upgrading , Dorman added, which will help the network grow in line with cheaper and faster alternatives such as Solana. Its next big update, called \"Dencun,\" is expected to take place in February and is meant to make transactions on so-called Layer 2 solutions \u2014 networks that sit on top of a base network like Ethereum and exist to provide extra capacity and functionality to the network \u2014 less expensive. Ether is also poised to benefit from the popularity of altcoins , many of which run on top of the Ethereum blockchain, according to Jason Urban, the global head of trading at Galaxy Digital. \"We've seen an uptick in alt interest. \u2026 ETH is probably more poised to benefit from that\" than bitcoin, he said. \"There are going to be people that will manifest that play, especially more [traditional finance] people that might not have access or the ability to trade a bag of alts. You'll see that manifest in ETH.\" For January, ETH is heading to a less than 1% gain, while other alts are a mixed bag. Since Jan. 23, however, when bitcoin fell below $40,000 for the first time this year, they've rallied, while ETH has been stagnant. ETH is weaker during that period, while SOL has gained 14%, Polygon's MATIC rose 4% and the tokens tied to Chainlink and Cardano advanced 4% and 3%, respectively. \"If you believe in a bullish market trend like in 2020 and 2021, then it makes sense to invest in the 'fastest horse,' which are the smaller and cheaper blockchains and applications,\" Dorman said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

According to the publicly reported data, IBIT continued to increase its BTC holdings on the last day of January, adding 2,712 BTC on Jan. 31.\n\nIBIT\u2019s holdings data doesn\u2019t correspond with the information by the blockchain platform Arkham Intelligence, which on Jan. 23 identified the on-chain addresses of six spot Bitcoin ETFs, including IBIT. According to Arkham\u2019s data, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ETF holds 57,488 BTC at the time of writing.\n\nCointelegraph approached Arkham for a comment regarding the discrepancy but had yet to receive a response at the time of publication.\n\nRelated: Cboe exchange withdraws application to list Global X spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nDespite all 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs adding 3% in total holdings in January, Bitcoin has seen a significant drop in price over the past 30 days.

In late 2023, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood predicted that some investors would \u201csell on the news\u201d of spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the short term. However, the long-term perspective is still promising, according to the executive.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?"

        "content": "Spot bitcoin ETFs from the largest issuers are separating themselves from the pack of 10 that launched earlier this month, as the race for billions of investor dollars flowing into the crypto investments begins to declare winners and losers.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) have gathered $2.8 billion and $2.2 billion in assets under management, respectively, since their Jan. 11 debut, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nEach of those totals is larger than the next seven spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds combined. The ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) have $662 million and $634 million in AUM, respectively, while the rest of the pack has $307 million or less.\n\nFund Data\n\nThe outcome may not necessarily surprise anyone. BlackRock was expected to eventually take the spot bitcoin ETF crown thanks to its position as the largest asset manager in the world, as well as the largest ETF issuer in the U.S.\n\nAnd as the third largest brokerage firm with a massive asset management business of its own, Fidelity was also anticipated to be a big player in the space.\n\nIBIT, FBTC Go for the Spot Bitcoin ETF Gold\n\nAs expectations are now being met, the gap between IBIT, FBTC and the rest of the pack will likely widen. Still, when or if either of those ETFs grabs the spot bitcoin ETF crown from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is open to debate.\n\nSince its conversion into an ETF, investors have pulled $5.5 billion out of GBTC, pushing its AUM down to $21.2 billion, according to Bloomberg data. But that still leaves it 10 times bigger than Fidelity\u2019s ETF and almost eight times bigger than BlackRock\u2019s fund.\n\nThe outflows from GBTC are already slowing. Most investors who were going to swap out of the relatively-expensive GBTC and into cheaper alternatives have already done so, while arbitrageurs who bought the trust at a discount before its conversion have already locked in their gains.\n\nOn the other hand anyone interested in investing in bitcoin through ETFs probably won\u2019t choose GBTC over its competitors due to its high fees, so it\u2019s unlikely that the trust sees substantial inflows anytime soon.\n\nWhat\u2019s at Stake\n\nStill, IBIT or FBTC taking over GBTC as the largest spot bitcoin ETF will take time. Assuming prices for bitcoin stay flat, it would take almost $20 billion of inflows for either ETF to eclipse GBTC in terms of total assets.\n\nIf bitcoin prices rise, it will take even larger inflows since GBTC\u2019s AUM will disproportionately benefit from that increase (a 10% increase in GBTC\u2019s AUM is $2.1 billion, while the same increase in IBIT\u2019s AUM is only $200 million).\n\nThe task becomes easier if bitcoin prices fall. In that scenario, GBTC\u2019s AUM will decline faster than that of either IBIT or FBTC (on a dollar basis), closing the gap between the funds."

        "content": "Build on Bitcoin\n\nBOB's latest innovation, OptiMine, introduces versatile crypto economic security, extending Bitcoin\u2019s PoW strength to diverse blockchain ecosystems\n\nLONDON , Jan. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ' Build on Bitcoin ' (BOB), the Layer 2 stack developed by the team behind leading Bitcoin DeFi platform Interlay , today announced OptiMine, an enhanced Bitcoin security feature for blockchains.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptiMine is a security building block that brings Bitcoin PoW security to L2s, including ETH rollups and Bitcoin sidechains, while retaining high performance and throughput. It brings a new dimension of crypto economic security to the industry, combining the robustness of Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) with the flexibility and scalability of Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\n\n\n\u201cOptiMine allows us to enhance L2 solutions with Bitcoin\u2019s PoW security, offering a powerful tool to make rollups more robust and reduce trust in Sequencers.\u201d said BOB\u2019s co-founder, Alexei Zamyatin. \u201cYou can think of OptiMine as Bitcoin\u2019s answer to Ethereum\u2019s restaking, aligning miners with the upcoming wave of Bitcoin L2s\u201d.\n\nThe protocol has been developed in collaboration with a leading Bitcoin mining company, underlining the importance of L2 solutions for the Bitcoin mining community.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Technological Breakthrough of OptiMine\n\nOptiMine introduces a novel hybrid consensus technique called \u201cOptimistically Sequenced Merged Mining\u201d that allows L2s like BOB to inherit Bitcoin security, while being connected to other L1s like Etheruem. This dual capability is an industry first and aligns with BOB's vision of being the connecting layer between Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems. This technique not only addresses a critical gap in the blockchain space, but also effectively combats the challenge of sparse block space and rising transaction fees. OptiMine is a first step towards BOB\u2019s ultimate goal to achieve Bitcoin security for Bitcoin assets (BTC, Ordinals, BRC20) and Ethereum security for Ethereum assets (ETH, stablecoins, ERC20s) on L2s, thus uniting the strengths of both ecosystems.\n\n\n\nOptiMine's approach to crypto economic security involves:\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin PoW Security: Sequencers are nodes that collect and organize transactions for efficient processing on Bitcoin-based blockchain networks. OptiMine harnesses the full nodes run by miners, ensuring that rollup block producers, like Sequencers, are correctly creating blocks.\n\nFast Block Times: Achieving rapid block times is crucial for modern blockchain applications. OptiMine allows rollups to maintain c. 2 second block times, while the secure PoW finalization happens at slower intervals, c.1 minute.\n\nRecovery Mechanisms: OptiMine introduces fallback protocols to maintain functionality and trust, even in the face of potential Sequencer or miner failures.\n\nDecentralized Sequencers. OptiMine can also be used as a mechanism to sample Bitcoin miners into the set of active Sequencers, once a rollup has achieved Sequencer decentralization.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Necessity in Today's Crypto Landscape\n\nOptiMine represents a significant advancement in blockchain technology by seamlessly aligning Bitcoin's L2 solutions with the original Bitcoin blockchain and its miners by allowing Bitcoin miners to mine concurrently on both the Bitcoin network and BOB's L2 solutions. As such, OptiMine presents miners with additional incentives and rewards, which is especially beneficial in light of Bitcoin halvings that diminish direct mining rewards. This innovative approach elevates OptiMine's role in providing alternative revenue streams for miners, enhancing its appeal and utility.\n\nFor more information, visit: www.gobob.xyz .\n\nAbout BOB\n\n'Build on Bitcoin' (BOB) is at the forefront of blockchain innovation, offering a unique Bitcoin rollup stack that integrates Rust smart contracts, native Bitcoin libraries, and complete EVM compatibility. With the addition of OptiMine, BOB sets a new standard in blockchain security and versatility, providing a platform for developers to explore and expand the boundaries of blockchain technology.\n\nVisit: www.gobob.xyz\n\n\n\nContact Information: BOB@transformgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT: Alexei Zamyatin Co-Founder of BOB C/O Transformgroup PR 4153402792 BOB at transformgroup.com\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Firms that revealed plans for a climate-conscious spot bitcoin ETF in December are still working on getting that fund to the US market.\n\nThe product proposed by alternative investment firm 7RCC and Tidal Investments would seek a portfolio comprising 80% bitcoin and 20% carbon credit futures contracts \u201cto provide exposure to bitcoin with an environmentally responsible approach,\u201d according to a Dec. 18 filing.\n\n7RCC would be the fund\u2019s bitcoin adviser, while Tidal Investments is set to be its sponsor. The firms have not yet disclosed a fee for the fund.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETFs could actually be good for the environment\n\nThe filing came just weeks ahead of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving spot bitcoin ETFs for the first time. In all, 10 spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the US on Jan. 11. Those funds have since brought in combined net flows of roughly $1.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nThough the planned 7RCC Spot Bitcoin and Carbon Credit Futures ETF was left out of the first wave of launches, the firms behind the proposal are moving forward with their plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little bit of a different product anyway,\u201d 7RCC CEO Rali Perduhova told Blockworks.\n\nA 19b-4 document \u2014 a form set to be submitted by the New York Stock Exchange in this case \u2014 has not yet been filed for the fund. SEC approval of such a document is necessary before it would begin trading.\n\nRead more: This proposed bitcoin ETF has a twist. Would investors bite?\n\nAddressing investor concerns\n\nThe proposed offering by 7RCC and Tidal Investments would give investors another bitcoin ETF option amid the ongoing conversations around the environmental impact of BTC mining.\n\nWhile critics of BTC mining note the sector\u2019s electricity usage, proponents have highlighted miners\u2019 increased use of renewable or otherwise stranded energy, as well as helping balance power grids.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cIn no means is this targeted against bitcoin itself,\u201d Perduhova said. \u201cI think you can apply a similar investment strategy to any industry out there. You can do the same with gold mining, you can do the same with banking, you can do the same with anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we know this has been a concern for certain investors and we wanted to address it,\u201d she added.\n\nRead more: US Department of Energy demands consumption stats from bitcoin miners\n\nCarbon credits represent the reduction or removal of greenhouse gas emissions that compensate for carbon emitted elsewhere. Carbon credit futures contracts physically deliver these carbon credits.\n\nThe 7RCC fund would seek to reflect the daily changes of the price in bitcoin and the value of carbon credit futures contracts as represented by the Vinter Bitcoin Carbon Credits Index.\n\nThe index\u2019s carbon credit futures are linked to the value of emissions allowances issued under the European Union Emissions Trading System, the California Carbon Allowance, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The fund would gain exposure to the carbon credit futures portion of the index via swap agreements.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence data indicates that global assets conscious of ESG \u2014 environmental, social and governance factors \u2014 are on track to hit $53 trillion by 2025.\n\nPerduhova said climate conversations on the government level have remained prevalent at events like the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n\u201cWhen you have governments involved in that, there is a lot of pressure coming from the top, and a lot of investors need to think along those lines going forward,\u201d Perduhova said.\n\nNeena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research, told Blockworks in December that she doubted the carbon credit futures twist in this fund would entice investors. But Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, argued the proposed fund could ultimately \u201ccarve out a unique niche\u201d in the bitcoin ETF category.\n\nTimeline of launch?\n\nIt remains unclear exactly when the proposed 7RCC Spot Bitcoin and Carbon Credit Futures ETF could launch. After the New York Stock Exchange submits a 19b-4 for the proposed fund, the SEC would publish the proposal into the federal register.\n\n\n\nFrom the date it hits the federal register, the regulator has 240 days before it would ultimately have to rule on the planned product.\n\nPerduhova declined to comment on the possible launch timeline given that the SEC is actively reviewing the plans.\n\nHowever, she noted: \u201cWe\u2019re not proposing anything much different on the bitcoin side than anybody else that got approved.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Respondents included independent registered investment advisers (RIAs), as well as broker-dealer representatives, financial planners and other institutional investors.\n\nOf the surveyed advisers interested in adding bitcoin exposure to client portfolios, nearly 90% said they were waiting until after a spot bitcoin ETF was approved.\n\nRead more: SEC officially approves spot bitcoin ETFs in landmark decision\n\nWirehouses \u2014 a term for firms such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo \u2014 are usually the slowest to allocate to new offerings, said Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Services and the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cMajor firms all have investment committees, which need time to decide which of these products to approve for use,\u201d Edelman told Blockworks. \u201cMeanwhile, their legal and compliance officers must write policies governing which of their advisers can offer these products, and which of the firm\u2019s clients will be permitted to invest in them \u2014 along with how much each client is permitted to invest.\u201d\n\nWhile independent RIAs are more agile when it comes to allocating new funds, a majority won\u2019t do so immediately, Edelman added. He noted that most advisers don\u2019t fully understand crypto or blockchain technology and will have to figure out how to explain these sectors to clients.\n\n\u201cOnly after they get past that hurdle are advisers ready to tackle the big tactical questions,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cWhich clients should invest in these ETFs? What allocation is best for them? How will the advisers communicate this recommendation, and how will they respond to client questions and objections?\u201d\n\nEdelman expects financial advisers to allocate more than $150 billion into spot bitcoin ETFs in the next two years.\n\nTen spot bitcoin ETFs launched on Jan. 11. While funds by BlackRock and Fidelity lead the pack with more than $2 billion of net inflows each, outflows from Grayscale Investments\u2019 Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) have tempered the sector\u2019s asset gains.\n\nEdelman predicts the BTC funds to be on wealth manager platforms \u2014 with advisers given the ability to allocate to them on behalf of clients \u2014 over the next six to 12 months.\n\n\u201cTo assess the real success of the bitcoin ETFs, months three through 12 will be much more important than months one through three,\u201d Thorn noted.\n\nRyan Rasmussen, senior crypto research analyst at Bitwise, said some wealth managers \u2014 namely RIAs \u2014 are already investing in crypto products, with allocations ranging between 1% and 5%. Teams at such investment firms are creating a crypto sleeve in their model portfolios, he added.\n\nRead more: Financial pros mull allocation boosts to \u2018chaos-resilient\u2019 BTC: Bitwise\n\n\u201cThat should translate to meaningful inflows into these products,\u201d Rasmussen told Blockworks. \u201cFor example, if the spot bitcoin ETFs sucked up 1% of all ETF assets in the US, that would be more than $70 billion of assets under management in spot bitcoin ETFs.

Miners compete to increase their hashrate in order to have higher chances of creating new blocks and boost revenue.\n\nMiner revenue has historically swelled during Bitcoin rallies, as mining operations earn higher rewards against lagging computational costs.\n\nHowever, since early 2023 the network\u2019s hashrate has kept pace with Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nHashprice shows how much Bitcoin miners earn against computational costs. (Coinbase/Coinbase)\n\nCoinbase warned that computational costs following Bitcoin\u2019s price so closely only left a little room for continued hashrate growth, especially after the halving.\n\nThis could eventually pose security concerns to Bitcoin.\n\nHalving\n\nThe Bitcoin halving, expected in April, will slash Bitcoin mining rewards by half \u2014 potentially depriving miners of as much as 50% of their total revenue.\n\nThe event will likely prove fatal to some mining outfits, Coinbase warned.\n\n\u201cWithout significant bitcoin price appreciation, the revenue per unit of hash power could drop to all time lows following the halving in April 2024,\u201d the report said.\n\nAs miner profits narrow, they will need to sell a higher percentage of their Bitcoin rewards in order to keep afloat.\n\nThis will likely not have an impact on the market, said Coinbase, since the Bitcoin rewards will be slashed by half, cancelling the sell pressure.\n\nHowever, distressed companies may have to liquidate their sizable Bitcoin reserves in an attempt to finance future operations.\n\nCore Scientific, once the biggest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company, suffered that fate in 2022, when it sold almost 8,500 Bitcoins over the course of the year before declaring bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThe next halving will weaken the viability of independent, non-institutional miners from retaining profitability, which could further contribute to consolidation both at the miner and the mining pool levels,\u201d Coinbase said.\n\n\u201cInstitutional miners likely are better positioned to acquire distressed mining assets at a discount, have improved operational efficiency due to economies of scale, and have access to cheaper energy sources,\u201d the report added.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin fell 0.6% over the last 24 hours, falling to $42,744.\n\nEthereum is down 0.4% in the same period, at $2,298.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Bitcoin stumbled on Jan. 31 after the United States Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged and hosed down hopes of a potential rate cut in March, leading one analyst to predict trouble ahead for U.S. stocks and BTC.\n\nDuring the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference on Jan. 31, the Fed said interest rates would stay at 5.25%\u20135.50%, adding that it would need \u201cgreater confidence\u201d that inflation pressures had been dealt with before cutting rates.\n\nIG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore told Cointelegraph that the Fed\u2019s hawkish sentiment could spell trouble for U.S. equities and risk assets such as Bitcoin (BTC).\n\n\u201cUnless earnings reports tomorrow from Apple, Amazon, and Meta shoot the lights out, expect to see a further pullback in U.S. equities in coming sessions, which will weigh on other risk assets, including Bitcoin,\u201d Sycamore said.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fell a little over 2.2% following the FOMC announcement and is currently changing hands for $42,590 \u2014 though it is still up 7% for the week, according to data from TradingView.\n\nBitcoin fell 2.2% following the FOMC\u2019s decision to pause rates. Source: TradingView\n\n\u201cThe Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,\u201d the Fed wrote in a statement.\n\nThe Fed added that recent indicators pointed to \u201csolid\u201d economic expansion, listing continued growth in jobs and a reduction in the unemployment rate as evidence of strength.\n\nHowever, the Fed reiterated its hawkishness, saying that while inflation had eased over the past year, it remains at a level where rate cuts are by no means a certainty.\n\n\u201cThe economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\u201d\n\nRate cuts are often considered bullish for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies and tech stocks.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve cuts rates, it makes it cheaper to borrow capital, which increases overall spending activity and risk-on behavior in the economy.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin might drop to $30,000, but that's OK\n\nSycamore added that Bitcoin would most likely continue to trade lower due to a deterioration in risk sentiment brought about by the Fed\u2019s hawkishness.\n\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s FOMC meeting led to disappointment from those banking on a Fed rate cut in March and compounds risk aversion flows stemming from yesterday\u2019s earnings report misses from Microsoft, Alphabet, and AMD,\u201d said Sycamore.\n\nSycamore added that investors could expect a rally toward around $45,000 before returning to the mid-$30,000 region. After this, Sycamore said that he expects Bitcoin\u2019s general uptrend to resume.\n\nBig Questions: How can Bitcoin payments stage a comeback?"

        "content": "The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is demanding crypto miners report their energy consumption for the next six months after concerns about a recent increase in the price of Bitcoin, which is leading to a rush of crypto mining.\n\nOn Jan. 31, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) \u2014 the statistics agency of the DOE \u2014 said it is initiating a provisional survey to gauge the electricity usage of local crypto mining companies starting next week, with miners \u201crequired to respond with details related to their energy use.\u201d\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget greenlit the survey on Jan. 26 after an emergency request from the EIA days earlier claimed Bitcoin\u2019s price \u201cincreased roughly 50% in the last three months\u201d would \u201cincentivize more cryptomining activity, which in turn increases electricity consumption.\u201d\n\nBitcoin (BTC) rose just over 18.5% in the three months to Jan. 24, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro.\n\nPublic comments regarding crypto miner\u2019s energy use will also be collected.\n\nWe're initiating collection of data regarding #electricity use by US #cryptocurrency miners.\n\n\n\nWe'll ask about their electricity consumption so we can better understand their energy demands.\n\n\n\nhttps://t.co/gYpZgtiD6J pic.twitter.com/pQ9ULoLAAU \u2014 EIA (@EIAgov) January 31, 2024\n\nEIA Administrator Joe DeCarolis said it would \u201cspecifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.\u201d\n\nThe survey is the U.S. government\u2019s latest move to get a handle on the crypto mining industry. The country became the world\u2019s largest hub for miners looking to move operations after China banned crypto mining in 2021.\n\nLawmakers probed the mining industry in a 2022 congressional hearing over concerns about energy use and fossil fuel emissions. In early 2023, Congress called for the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the impact of crypto mining.\n\nIn 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden also floated a proposal to implement a 30% incremental tax on crypto miner\u2019s electricity costs to \u201creduce mining activity\u201d in the country.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption: A new environmental threat?\n\nBitcoin miners consumed an estimated 121.13 terawatt-hours of electricity globally in 2023 \u2014 an all-time high from data going back to 2010, according to Cambridge University\u2019s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.\n\nIn comparison, 2022 data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows the European country of Belgium consumed 93.8 terawatt-hours.\n\nThat consumption is expected to increase, with the IEA forecasting in a Jan. 25 report that crypto mining will use 160 terawatt-hours by 2026.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "title": "Could Bitcoin Fall Below $20,000 This Year? That's What Many Retail Investors Are Expecting - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Where will Bitcoin (BTC -5.14%) go from here? Now that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have obtained approval, there should be more room for Bitcoin's value to go up given that it is easier than ever to invest in it. But in the days following the approval, the cryptocurrency actually declined in value.\n\nThere aren't earnings reports or sales numbers that can help suggest where Bitcoin's value will go. Speculators play a big role in the digital currency's valuation, and that's why there can often be a great deal of volatility and risk when investing in Bitcoin. And right now, a large chunk of retail investors are expecting a significant decline in 2024.\n\nMany retail investors expect Bitcoin to fall below $20,000 this year\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Deutsche Bank, retail investors aren't overly optimistic about crypto's near-term future. More than a third of retail investors expect the price of Bitcoin to fall to less than $20,000 by the end of the year. And around 10% believe that it will finish the year between $20,000 and $40,000, suggesting a more modest decline.\n\nThere are some crypto bulls out there who believe it could rise to more than $75,000 before the end of 2024, but that is the minority, with about 10% of retail investors in the U.S. expecting it to hit those levels. And that falls to just 5% of retail investors in Europe, and even less than that in the U.K.\n\nCould this be a self-fulfilling prophecy?\n\nWhen it comes to speculation, expectations can play a large role in returns. If investors expect an investment to underperform, they could sell the asset, hoping to avoid a loss on it in the future. And if there is a large number of people holding that opinion, there could be a surge of selling, putting downward pressure on the investment -- which in this case would be Bitcoin.\n\nThere are some early signs that investors may already be cashing out. After approval of many spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, investors unloaded Bitcoin as the digital currency went in the opposite direction of where some investors might have expected it to go after the approvals (i.e., up). At the end of 2023, Bitcoin was trading at more than $42,000, but it is little changed since then.\n\nThe big test for Bitcoin could come in April\n\nAn expectation of a lower price for Bitcoin is troubling, because it could lead to more selling in the near future. But one potential catalyst that may help the digital asset's valuation is Bitcoin halving. That's when the rewards for mining the crypto are cut in half in order to limit its supply growth. After halving events, there is typically an increase in the price of Bitcoin. That's at least what has happened at previous halving events in 2020, 2016, and 2012.\n\nHowever, at previous halving events, Bitcoin's value was never as high as it is now. In 2020, when it was trading at about $8,820 on halving day, it would rise to roughly $10,940 in the 150 days after the event, a 24% gain. A similar type of move this year could push Bitcoin up to around $50,000.\n\nThe next halving event is likely to happen in April. Whether Bitcoin does indeed benefit from a big rally after could dictate how the digital currency does the rest of the year, as that momentum could carry it for months.\n\nUltimately, there isn't a reason to think halving will have such a positive effect on the price, which suggests the event may already be priced in. But given the pattern of previous halving events, it wouldn't be surprising to see Bitcoin's price jump this year -- the big question is how much.\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin today?\n\nBitcoin is a volatile and risky investment. It can be extremely difficult to try and predict where its value will go. For the majority of investors, it may not be a suitable investment option given its inherent volatility.\n\nIf you're willing to take on that risk and are looking to hang on for the long term, then it may make sense to invest in the digital asset given the approval of the recent spot Bitcoin ETFs, as that should bring in a broader pool of investors.\n\nAt the very least, investors should expect a bumpy ride, regardless of which direction you expect Bitcoin to go this year."

The question now facing advisors and investors alike when it comes to crypto is: \u2018What comes next?\u2019\n\nOn February 15, 2024 at 11:00 AM EST, Grayscale Investments, in partnership with InvestmentNews, will convene a panel to answer that question, and provide insights on how advisors should think about spot Bitcoin ETFs when it comes to portfolio construction. The webinar will also cover what advisors may want to keep in mind when discussing factors and opportunities with clients.\n\n\u201cInvestors are navigating a landscape marked by high valuations and the introduction of novel financial products, such as Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d said Zach Pandl, managing director for research at Grayscale. \u201cThis situation necessitates a nuanced understanding of how to effectively integrate these innovative products into their portfolios.\u201d\n\nPandl says these new products encapsulate assets underpinned by complex and cutting-edge technologies. As a result, investors must be adept at balancing these elements to optimize their investment strategies with underlying political uncertainty in the upcoming election year.\n\nSteven Max, analyst in investor solutions at Grayscale, adds that industry professionals can prepare for these challenges by understanding that Bitcoin has a high risk and high return potential combined with a low correlation to stocks, historically.\n\nIn Max\u2019s view, the classic 60/40 portfolio cannot produce returns comparable to the last 40 years because the long decline in inflation is over. That said, Bitcoin can help the average investor build a portfolio with attractive risk-adjusted returns over time.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETFs will likely be a cost effective and efficient way for the average household to invest in Bitcoin,\u201d said Max. \u201cIt solves all the complexities around custody and trading liquidity that investors would otherwise need to tackle.\u201d\n\nBoth Pandl and Max stress that the onus is now on industry professionals to gain a deeper understanding of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. This also necessitates an understanding as to how Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs can be incorporated into diverse investment portfolios as a unique opportunity to help improve risk-adjusted returns.\n\n\u201cJust like any asset class, crypto\u2019s characteristics may change over time, so investors should regularly reevaluate their portfolios,\u201d said Pandl. \u201cThe average investor might consider allocating about 5% of their financial assets to crypto over time, starting with a Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the upcoming webinar with Grayscale, providing essential insights on how advisors should be thinking about spot Bitcoin ETFs and what to keep front of mind when discussing factors and opportunities with clients \u2013 secure your free spot here.\n\nImportant Disclosures:\n\nInvestments in digital assets are speculative investments that involve high degrees of risk, including a partial or total loss of invested funds.

        "title": "Worst Case Scenario for Bitcoin in 2024 Still Attractive - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market capitalization, has recently cobbled together solid gains . It entered this week flirting with $50,000.\n\nIn what could prove to be good news for ETFs such as the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), some market observers believe the worst case scenario in 2024 for the crypto\u2019s price is to run to $55,000.\n\nThat implies upside of 13.6% from where bitcoin traded as of late February 11. Should that increase be realized or exceeded, it could have positive implications for the stocks residing in BLOK. Plenty of those respond positively (and negatively) to bitcoin price action.\n\nBitcoin Bulls Making Their Voices Heard\n\nBLOK jumped 9.48% last week. And in an indication that more could be in store for the ETF, some bitcoin bulls are highlighting potentially significant upside for the cryptocurrency over the course of 2024. In recent posts on X (formerly Twitter), Ki Young Ju, CEO of analytics platform CryptoQuant, said he believes bitcoin could ascend to $112,000 by the end of 2024. He sees $55,000 being the worst case outlook.\n\nJu cites the January debut of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs as a catalyst for upside. He noted that other funds can absorb outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and that the crypto itself can withstand that selling pressure.\n\nThe \u201cbitcoin market has seen $9.5B in spot ETF inflows per month, potentially boosting the realized cap by $114B yearly,\u201d noted the expert. \u201cEven with $GBTC outflows, a $76B rise could elevate the realized cap from $451B to $527-565B.\u201d\n\nJu believes that if inflows to U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs maintain current levels, the digital currency could ascend to $104,000-$112,000 by the end of the year. Even at the low end of that range, bitcoin would need to more than double from current levels. That would potentially imply substantial upside ahead for equity-based ETFs such as BLOK.\n\nOther experts, such as Blockstream CEO Adam Back, noted that the digital currency\u2019s recent price action is bullish. He pointed out that the last time the cryptocurrency traversed $48,000 to the upside, it ran to its all-time high around $69,000.\n\nIn what could be catalyst for BLOK, Back noted that bitcoin\u2019s April halving is just about 2 months away. That widely anticipated event could be the catalyst to get the digital currency to a record high or even $100,000 in advance of the halving.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Google has begun to permit advertisements featuring U.S. spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as of Jan. 29.\n\nThe company\u2019s restricted financial products policy page now reads:\n\n\u201cGoogle allows ads promoting cryptocurrency coin trusts targeting the United States, as long as the advertiser has successfully registered under Section 12 of the Exchanges Act using form 10-12g. Reporting requirements \u2026 and any other local legal requirements must also be complied with. Advertisers must also be certified with Google.\u201d\n\nThird-party reports indicate that some asset managers have already begun to advertise their ETFs with Google. One X post from WatcherGuru shows that BlackRock and VanEck spot Bitcoin ETFs now appear as sponsored links in Google search results. Another post from BITCOINLFG\u00ae indicates that sponsored links for Franklin Templeton\u2019s product appear in those results.\n\nAn update from December indicates that the policy takes effect today, Jan. 29, 2024, and has been planned for more than a month.\n\nThe same page defines crypto coin trusts as \u201cfinancial products that allow investors to trade shares in trusts holding large pools of digital currency.\u201d\n\nThat definition clearly includes various spot Bitcoin ETFs that regulators approved on on Jan. 10. Additionally, because the definition does not name Bitcoin or any other particular cryptocurrency, it will presumably allow for ads related to spot Ethereum ETFs if such a fund gains approval in the coming months.\n\nGoogle currently permits other crypto ads\n\nGoogle largely banned cryptocurrency-related advertising circa 2018 but has gradually undone those restrictions in recent months and years.\n\nIn June 2021, the company updated its policy to permit ads for some crypto exchanges and wallets in the U.S. but maintained a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and aggregation or comparison services. In July 2022, it extended similar rules permitting exchange and wallet advertisements internationally.\n\nIn August 2023, Google began to allow advertisements for blockchain-based NFT games that do not include gambling features. The company\u2019s current policy also indicates that advertisements for hardware wallets are permitted.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "The marketing around the recelty approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds will lead to more capital flowing directly into Bitcoin than that flowing into the ETFs, according to Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten. He calls this phenomenon \u201cThe ETF multiplier effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the existence of the ETFs and the credibility of these large financial firms getting into the space and validating it in the eyes of investors [...] A lot more Bitcoin will be purchased through all the other sellers around the world,\u201d Klippsten explained during an exclusive Cointelegraph interview.\n\nDespite capital outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) putting downward pressure on Bitcoin's price, Klippsten remains extremley bullish in the long term.\n\nKlippsten believes \"there is a pretty good likelihood\u201d an Ethereum ETF will be approved soon in the U.S., mainly due to the influence of Consenys and the Ethereum Fondation over U.S. regulators.\n\nWhile an ETF approval may grant Etheruem a stamp of legitimacy , Klippsten says, the second largest cryptocurrrency will still be regarded as centralized, unlike Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt will trade like a tech stock at best,\u201d he said.\n\nTo find out more on Klippsten\u2019s outlook on Bitcoin following the ETF approval, watch the full interview on our YouTube channel and don\u2019t forget to subscribe."

        "content": "Authorities reportedly confiscated Bitcoin worth $1.7 billion after a former restaurant worker attempted to buy a mansion worth about $30 million in London.\n\nOn Jan. 30, Sky News reported that Jian Wen, a Chinese national who became a British citizen in 2018, was allegedly recruited to assist Zhimin Qian in money laundering. Qian, who went to the United Kingdom under a false identity, needed help cleaning up the funds taken from an investment fraud scheme facilitated in China from 2014 to 2017.\n\nWen used to work at a Chinese restaurant in southeast London before meeting Qian. The takeaway worker lived in a room underneath the restaurant before she met her \u201cboss,\u201d whom she introduced as working in an international jewelry business.\n\nProsecutor Gillian Jones said that Wen attempted to buy luxury items and real estate in London with Bitcoin (BTC). This included a seven-bedroom mansion in Hampstead with a swimming pool. The property was on the market for $30 million, but the purchases didn\u2019t go through when Wen could not explain the source of the crypto assets.\n\nImage of the property that Wen attempted to purchase. Source: Google Street View (via Sky New)\n\nJones told the jury at the trial that Wen was not involved in the fraud committed by Qian. However, Wen is accused of converting Bitcoin into cash, luxury items and real estate on behalf of Qian.\n\nAuthorities reportedly raided a house that Wen and Qian rented and confiscated various devices containing more than 61,000 BTC, worth about $1.7 billion when it was accessed back in 2021.\n\nRelated: Couple mistakenly sent $10.5M by Crypto.com to face October plea hearing\n\nInitially, Wen claimed that the crypto she held had been mined. Then, she changed her story, saying it was a \u201clove present,\u201d presenting a deed stating that she received 3,000 BTC from Qian.\n\nWen is now on trial at the Southwark Crown Court for three counts of money laundering between October 2017 and January 2022. She denies all the charges against her. Meanwhile, Qian has already fled the United Kingdom and is still at large.\n\nMagazine: $308M crypto laundering scheme busted, Hashkey token, Hong Kong CBDC: Asia Express"
