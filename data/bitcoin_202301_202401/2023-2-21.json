        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Altcoins: Comparing Investment Opportunities and Risks - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have grown in popularity as an investment option in recent years. Although Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, there are numerous other digital currencies known as 'altcoins' that provide a variety of investment opportunities and risks.\n\nWe will compare Bitcoin and altcoins in this article to help investors make informed decisions about their crypto investments.\n\nBitcoin Is the Original Cryptocurrency\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group of individuals known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is decentralized, which means that no government or financial institution controls it. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain, which is maintained by a global network of computers.\n\nBitcoin Investment Possibilities\n\nFor years, Bitcoin has been the most popular and well-known cryptocurrency, making it a popular investment option. Bitcoin has steadily increased in value over the years, reaching an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in 2021.\n\nKeep Reading Social Media Reward Coins: A Catalyst for Widespread Crypto Adoption\n\nThe value of Bitcoin is primarily determined by demand, and it is widely accepted as a payment method by many merchants around the world.\n\nRisks\n\nBitcoin is a volatile asset, with rapid fluctuations in value. Aside from market volatility, there are risks associated with technology itself. Because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, there is no way to recover your funds if you send Bitcoin to the wrong address or fall victim to a scam.\n\nFurthermore, due to the lack of regulation surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, investors have little protection in the event of fraud or hacking.\n\nAltcoins: A Wide Range of Options\n\nAlternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, are any digital currencies other than Bitcoin. There are thousands of altcoins, each with its own set of characteristics and applications. Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, and Dogecoin are among the most popular altcoins.\n\nAltcoin Investment Possibilities\n\nAltcoins provide alternative investment opportunities to Bitcoin. Some altcoins are intended to be more efficient or functional than Bitcoin, whereas others are intended for specific applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Some altcoins, such as Ethereum, have seen significant growth in recent years and have the potential for future gains.\n\nRisks\n\nInvesting in altcoins entails the same risks as investing in Bitcoin, such as market volatility and technological risks. Furthermore, because altcoins are not as widely accepted as Bitcoin, there is less liquidity, making it more difficult to buy or sell altcoins at a reasonable price.\n\nFurthermore, because there are so many altcoins to choose from, determining which ones have long-term potential and which are scams or have no real value can be difficult.\n\nBitcoin and Altcoin Comparison\n\nThere are several factors to consider when comparing Bitcoin and altcoins:\n\nAdoption\n\nBitcoin is the most widely used cryptocurrency, with many merchants accepting it and many investors using it as a store of value. While some altcoins have gained popularity, none are as well-known as Bitcoin.\n\nVolatility\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is a volatile asset, some altcoins are even more so. It is critical to be prepared for rapid price fluctuations when investing in altcoins.\n\nCase Studies\n\nThe primary application of Bitcoin is as a store of value and a means of payment. Altcoins have a diverse set of use cases, ranging from DeFi to NFTs, so it is critical to research each altcoin's specific use case and potential.\n\nTechnology\n\nBitcoin is a well-established technology with a large and active developer community. Some altcoins have innovative technologies, but it is critical to investigate the technical details to determine whether they are viable and secure.\n\nShould I Buy Altcoins? Are Altcoins a Safe Investment or Pure Speculation?\n\nMany have wondered if altcoins are a safe investment. Over the past few years, altcoins have come and gone while BTC remains as the 'one true king of cryptocurrencies'.\n\nIn fact, there are many Bitcoin maximalists who believe BTC is the only investment one should have in the crypto universe as it will probably be the only digital currency which we\u2019ll need in the future. However, even if they believe that they might be on the right side of things in the long term, for now, surprisingly, they might be missing the forest for the trees.\n\nThe simple fact is that altcoins can be seen in many different ways and through many different lenses.\n\nEach altcoin has its own underlying projects, its problem that is trying to solve within the cryptocurrency landscape, and so forth.\n\nAs such, one can think of an altcoin as a long-term investment and buy them as an investor who believes in its project, or, as many do, as a short-term speculative investment.\n\nRegardless of your reasons, there are certain elements that you do need to be concerned about.\n\nFirst and foremost, you should define how much of your investment portfolio is going to be allocated to altcoin investment.\n\nFollowing that, it is important to do your own due diligence and thoroughly understand what the project is, what it is trying to do, and who the team is behind accomplishing said goals.\n\nFollowing that reputation risk assessment, it is also important to follow through with a market access risk analysis, meaning that you will want to stay clear of obscure coins which aren\u2019t sold on reputable exchanges.\n\nLastly, it is extremely important that you understand the technical risk behind your potential altcoin investment, namely its code and if it has been audited by a credible third party.\n\nSo, in short, yes, altcoins can present themselves as incredible investment opportunities if approached with care and proper due diligence.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies, whether Bitcoin or altcoins, entails risks as well as rewards. Because of Bitcoin's dominance as the original cryptocurrency, it is a safer and more stable investment, whereas altcoins offer higher potential returns but at a higher risk.\n\nBefore investing, it is critical to understand the various investment opportunities and risks associated with each cryptocurrency.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of cryptocurrencies is their decentralization, which means they are not controlled by the government or central banks. However, because they are not backed by tangible assets or government guarantees, they are a more speculative investment.\n\nWhen investing in cryptocurrencies, it's critical to understand the underlying technology and fundamentals that drive their value. It's also critical to stay current on market news and regulatory developments, as these can have a significant impact on cryptocurrency value.\n\nTo summarize, Bitcoin and altcoins provide distinct investment opportunities and risks, and investors should carefully consider their investment objectives and risk tolerance before investing in either.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is a safer and more stable investment, altcoins offer higher potential returns but at a higher risk. Investors can navigate the complex world of cryptocurrencies and potentially reap the benefits with careful research and a long-term investment strategy."

        "title": "Stolen crypto - UK Court of Appeal opens door to software developers' legal duties to users | Insights - Mayer Brown",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe roller coaster ride that is Tulip Trading v Wladimir van der Laan & Ors \u2013 as we have previously discussed \u2013 has taken another turn.\n\nOn 3 February 2023, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales unanimously decided to allow the appeal of Tulip Trading Limited (\"Tulip\"), reversing the prior order of the High Court, dated 25 March 2022. In particular, the Court determined that establishing whether or not certain Bitcoin developers owe a legal duty to Tulip \u2013 such that they may be compelled to assist Tulip in recovering Bitcoin lost as a result of a computer hack \u2013 is a \"serious issue to be tried\". This determination resulted in the Court of Appeal finding that the English courts do have jurisdiction over the case, as it ensured that the three part test for jurisdiction was found to be satisfied (see, e.g. VTB paragraphs 99-101).\n\nAs a result, the case is now expected to go to full trial in 2024.\n\nWhilst this decision is largely procedural, and the final position on the existence of any duties will depend on the facts as established at the full trial (e.g. the extent to which the relevant Bitcoin networks are decentralised, and whether it is technologically possible to achieve the remedy sought by Tulip), the decision is a milestone with potentially far-reaching implications for the wider crypto and blockchain world:\n\nit (re)opens the door to the imposition of fiduciary duties on software developers who \"look after\" cryptocurrencies on behalf of users / owners; it may thereby offer victims of crypto theft or fraud a route to recovery; and it indicates that the English courts remain open to adapting complex areas of law to account for fast\u2011developing technology.\n\nThe Court of Appeal Judgment\n\nIn its decision, the Court of Appeal focused on evaluating whether there is \"a real as opposed to fanciful prospect\" of fiduciary duties being imposed on the respondent developers, given the facts of the case. Whilst recognising that, in the words of Lord Justice Birss, \"for Tulip's case to succeed would involve a significant development of the common law on fiduciary duties\", the Court nevertheless found it to be clearly arguable that fiduciary duties do exist, as the software developers who look after the relevant Bitcoin networks have undertaken roles which bear at least some relationship to the interests of Bitcoin owners.\n\nThe Court of Appeal considered there to be a realistic argument that:\n\n\"[t]he developers of a given network are a sufficiently well-defined group to be capable of being subject to fiduciary duties. Viewed objectively the developers have undertaken a role which involves making discretionary decisions and exercising power for and on behalf of other people, in relation to property owned by those other people. That property has been entrusted into the care of the developers\u2026 The essence of that duty is single minded loyalty to the users of bitcoin software. The content of the duties includes a duty not to act in their own self-interest and also involves a duty to act in positive ways in certain circumstances. It may also, realistically, include a duty to act to introduce code so that an owner's bitcoin can be transferred to safety in the circumstances alleged by Tulip.\"\n\nIn concluding that there was a realistic prospect that fiduciary duties could be found to exist, the Court noted that Tulip had amended its case \u2013 moving from its position that a breach of fiduciary duties occurred when the developers did not act following a user raising a theft claim with them, to an amended position which, at its highest, asserted that the alleged duties arose where it was established (e.g. by a court with competent jurisdiction) that a user's cryptocurrency had been stolen. The Court noted that in doing so, Tulip had removed one of \"the difficulties with its case\". In assessing whether the amended case nevertheless did not stand a realistic prospect of success, on the basis that utilisation of such a court-based standard raised the risk that contradictory judgments could be attained from different courts leading to conflict of laws issues, the Court determined such a risk could not justify a finding that there is no serious issue to be tried \u2013 as the Court stated: \"[t]he internet is not a place the law does not apply.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeal also made clear that it remains open-minded to the development of this area of law in response to fast technological evolution - as Lord Justice Birss stated, \"\u2026the common law often works incrementally and by analogy with existing cases, and rightly so; but if the facts change in a way which is more than incremental I do not believe the right response of the common law is simply to stop and say that incremental development cannot reach that far.\" It will thus be interesting to see how far the common law of fiduciary duties will advance from existing principles in the final judgment, if at all.\n\nKey observations\n\nThis Court of Appeal ruling is perhaps not surprising, given the importance and complexity of the issue as to whether Bitcoin is truly decentralised and the scale of the claim \u2013 the Bitcoin in dispute having been valued at some \u00a34bn in 2021. As the Court of Appeal put it, \"[i]f the decentralised governance of bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment there is much to be said for the submission that bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property\".\n\nLeaving aside the controversy surrounding Dr. Craig Wright, the owner of Tulip, the reaction to this Court of Appeal decision within the crypto / blockchain community has been divided. On the one hand, the spectre of liability now hangs over crypto software developers in relation to certain types of losses suffered by their users; this may deter some developers/engineers from taking on roles which could conceivably entail fiduciary duties. Notably, as many blockchain networks are more centralised than the networks at the centre of this case \u2013 and greater centralisation appears to increase the possibility that fiduciary duties might exist \u2013 it is a broad selection of chain administrators that may need to consider the potential implications of this judgment.\n\nOn the other hand, this decision may be welcomed by crypto-asset investors, on the basis that it potentially provides an alternative (and more straightforward) route to redress for fraud victims. Currently, crypto owners / investors have little hope of recovering stolen crypto assets and/or private keys, which are at the mercy of the software developers/engineers.\n\nFinally, against the backdrop of the current project on digital assets undertaken by the Law Commission, the Court of Appeal recognised the possible need for statutory intervention if the law on digital assets and blockchain requires developments beyond those possible through common law. Nevertheless, the discussion in this case demonstrates that the English courts are willing to engage with these difficult subjects in order to provide greater legal clarity, as part of the UK's broader strategy to support innovation within the UK's digital ecosystem."

        "title": "Ordinals: Bitcoin Congestion Is Actually a Blessing in Disguise - nft now",
        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals are here and seemingly here to stay. But not everyone is happy about their presence. Because Ordinals increase traffic on the blockchain, seasoned HODLers and those accustomed to using Bitcoin solely for its primary purpose (transacting) have raised concerns about the congestion these digital artifacts might be causing.\n\nWith this in mind, it\u2019s no surprise that when independent developer and Taproot Wizards founder Udi Wertheimer purposefully orchestrated the largest block and largest transaction in Bitcoin\u2019s history, the keepers of tradition weren\u2019t thrilled. But to industry disruptors like him, maxing out BTC\u2019s block size and its corresponding effects aren\u2019t a cause for contention but for celebration.\n\nWhy? Because it means innovation is still possible on the world\u2019s first blockchain.\n\nBlockchain congestion: A good problem to have?\n\nIt\u2019s almost universally understood that network congestion is a problem. Congestion leads to slowed transaction speeds, increased energy demands, higher fees, and, ultimately, a decline in usability. Yet, without a problem, there can be no solution. Recently, the crypto industry witnessed Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption drop to almost 99.99 percent thanks to the long-awaited merge. But before the switch, congestion had to be tackled in other ways.\n\nEthereum survived for years before merging from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake with the help of layer two solutions like the Polygon blockchain that helped process transactions off of the mainnet. While Bitcoin surely doesn\u2019t need the same level of salvation that a merge or other overhaul might provide, with congestion increasing, layer twos may act as a saving grace once again.\n\nCurrently, blockchains adjacent to BTC, like the Internet Computer (ICP), Stacks, and others, have the potential to alleviate the issues befalling Bitcoin as a result of Ordinals. By taking transactions off the Bitcoin mainnet \u2014which can only complete seven transactions per second \u2014 as opposed to ICP \u2014 which can execute 11,500 \u2014 these blockchains help loosen the grip that Ordinals is gaining. But while this act, at face value, might read as a major win for BTC, these layer twos also stand to benefit as a result.\n\nWhile congestion can inhibit Bitcoin, it provides opportunities for developers, especially those working with layer twos, in the form of usership and liquidity. Stacks alone has already seen a significant spike in the price of its native token, STX, as a direct result of handling Ordinals traffic. And who\u2019s to say that further benefit cannot come from the current hardships being felt on Bitcoin? This is precisely the thinking of those like Wertheimer, who feel there\u2019s value in pushing boundaries.\n\nCongestion as a catalyst for change\n\nWertheimer believes that rules must be broken and the status quo must be challenged to muster up renewed interest in innovation on the Bitcoin blockchain. While he thinks that the Bitcoin community would have once agreed with this statement, he feels that it lost momentum, with the unique, creative, and humorous culture once established by early crypto adopters now transferred to the NFT space.\n\n\u201cI feel like the Bitcoin community, in the last two or three years, has been very dismissive of everything that\u2019s been happening in crypto. I think that\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s very different from what Bitcoin culture used to be,\u201d Wertheimer said in an interview with nft now. \u201cBitcoin culture used to be very open, very experimental. People were interested in trying things that were never tried before, even if they didn\u2019t know if it was going to work out.\u201d\n\nThrough Taproots Wizards, which Wertheimer launched by way of the aforementioned larger-than-life 4MB Bitcoin block, Wertheimer hopes to reignite that flame of innovation.\n\nDid you know that ordinals are not the first NFTs on Bitcoin? In fact, Bitcoin has had NFTs for nearly a decade! In 2015 Spells of Genesis tokenized the first gaming assets and in 2016 Rare Pepes gave birth to the cryptoart movement. pic.twitter.com/NibfcKxNRZ \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) February 15, 2023 BTC Ordinals opened the Overton Window for Bitcoin liquidity to participate in supporting artists and culture\n\n\n\nIf more than 45% of Bitcoiner holders take an interest in it, BTC Ordinals will be bigger than ETH NFTs\n\n\n\nThis doesn't even count supply constraints of Ordinals \u2014 trevor.btc (@TO) February 6, 2023\n\nWhile Wertheimer is undoubtedly acting to bring excitement back to Bitcoin \u2014 as illustrated by Taproots Wizard\u2019s \u201cMake Bitcoin Magical Again\u201d tagline \u2014 he says his secondary goal is to remind developers that failure is a necessary part of growth. Now seen as somewhat of an outlier of the traditional Bitcoin community thanks to the hand he played in network congestion, and one that exists between NFTs and BTC, he is hoping to communicate a simple idea: if it is possible to do something on the blockchain, why not try it?\n\n\u201cThe statement we\u2019re trying to make is: whatever the Bitcoin protocol allows us to do, we\u2019re going to do it. Even if something is potentially damaging, then by doing it, we\u2019re going to learn what the issues are, and then, if we need to, fix them,\u201d said Wertheimer. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to have software that is completely perfect. I think that a much better approach to life, and Bitcoin as well, is that failures and mistakes are going to happen, but they should be embraced because that\u2019s how you correct your path. That\u2019s how progress is made in all fields.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ordinals are far from being accepted by the greater Bitcoin community, thanks to Wertheimer\u2019s actions, new conversations are happening on the world\u2019s most secure blockchain. While some might argue against fixing something that isn\u2019t broken, as proven within Web3, stagnancy is becoming less and less sustainable. To make the proverbial omelet of the metaverse, eggs must be broken \u2014 and beyond NFTs, according to those like Wertheimer, that all starts with Bitcoin."

        "content": "'Truly a sham market': Jim Cramer says you need to ignore the 'crypto cheerleaders' now that bitcoin is bouncing \u2014 this is why and what he likes instead\n\nAfter a terrible 2022, cryptocurrencies seem to have finally found some upward momentum again. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, is up 48% this year.\n\nBut CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer isn\u2019t a fan.\n\nDon\u2019t miss\n\n'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos issued a financial warning, says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' \u2014 here are 3 better recession-proof buys\n\nRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nHere's how much money the average middle-class American household makes \u2014 how do you stack up?\n\n\u201cThe charts, as interpreted by Carley Garner, suggest you need to ignore the crypto cheerleaders now that bitcoin\u2019s bouncing,\u201d he says, referencing analysis from DeCarley Trading\u2019s senior commodity market strategist and broker Carley Garner.\n\nSome say that cryptocurrencies can be used as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, for instance, can\u2019t be printed out of thin air like fiat money. The number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million by mathematical algorithms.\n\nCramer, however, suggests using something much older to fight inflation.\n\n\u201cIf you seriously want a real hedge against inflation or economic chaos, she [Garner] says you should stick with gold. And I agree,\u201d the Mad Money host says.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019ve been following Cramer, you\u2019d already know that he hasn\u2019t been optimistic about the crypto world lately.\n\n\u201cThe manipulation higher of crypto shows you this is truly a sham market,\u201d he tweeted earlier in January.\n\nIf you share Cramer\u2019s view and want to use gold as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty, here are three ways to gain exposure to the shiny metal.\n\nBullion\n\nInvesting in gold has been considered the go-to inflation-fighting move.\n\nIt can also be a great hedge against uncertainty, as the value of gold is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.\n\nAnd because of the precious metal\u2019s safe-haven status, investors often rush toward it in times of crisis, making it an effective hedge.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first method to invest in gold is the most straightforward one: if you want to own gold, just buy gold.\n\nMost bullion shops carry a selection of gold bars and coins, so you can always find something that fits your investment needs. Just remember, if you want to invest in a large amount of gold and don\u2019t want to keep the stash at home, you will likely need to pay for storage at a vault.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable \u2014 this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth instead\n\nGold mining companies\n\nWhen the price of gold goes up, your gold bars and coins will be worth more. But gold mining companies can also benefit in such a scenario.\n\nBarrick Gold, for instance, is a gold and copper producer operating mines and projects in 18 countries in North and South America, Africa, Papua New Guinea and Saudi Arabia. In 2021, the company produced 4.4 million ounces of gold and generated net earnings of $2.0 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s also Newmont (NYSE:NEM), another heavyweight player in the gold mining industry and the only gold producer in the S&P 500. Its portfolio of assets span North and South America, Australia, and Africa. The company also produces copper, silver, zinc and lead.\n\nHigher gold prices can allow miners to earn higher revenues and profits, which could translate to higher share prices. However, each company is different so make sure to do your research and find the ones that can keep costs down and run efficient operations.\n\nETFs\n\nExchange-traded funds have risen in popularity in recent years. They trade on stock exchanges, so buying and selling them is very convenient.\n\nInvestors can use them to get a piece of the gold action, too.\n\nThe most well-known ETF in this space is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD), which is designed to track the price of gold. GLD is backed by physical gold bullion sitting at its vaults and has an expense ratio of 0.40%.\n\nThe iShares Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:IAU) is another ETF that allows investors to easily track the price of the yellow metal. It holds gold bullion \u2014 just like GLD \u2014 but has a lower expense ratio at 0.25%.\n\nThere are also ETFs that provide exposure to gold mining companies.\n\nFor instance, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. It has a portfolio of gold mining stocks, with Newmont and Barrick Gold as its two largest holdings.\n\nGDX has an expense ratio of 0.51%.\n\nA better way to buy gold?\n\nOf course, those aren't the only ways to gain exposure to the yellow metal.\n\nA Gold IRA, for example, is a type of individual retirement account that allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms, such as coins, instead of stocks, mutual funds and other traditional investments.\n\nIt\u2019s a great alternative because unlike the U.S. dollar, which has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971, gold\u2019s purchasing power remains more stable over time.\n\nOpting for a Gold IRA gives you the opportunity to both diversify your portfolio and stabilize your finances.\n\nIf you want to open a Gold IRA, there are reputable services that\u2019ll let you roll over your current 401(k) or IRA into this new account \u2014 and quickly.\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "content": "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York led a study that examined the relationship between bitcoin and macroeconomic data, finding that the two barely have a link.\n\n\u201cThe key result is that, unlike other US asset classes, Bitcoin is orthogonal to monetary and macroeconomic news,\u201d economists Gianluca Benigno and Carlo Rosa wrote.\n\nThey did flag that bitcoin seems to be slightly sensitive to consumer price index (CPI) data \u2014 a measure of inflation \u2014 however its coefficient was only 5%.\n\n\u201cIf we restrict the sample to the period 2017-2021, the CPI coefficient is no longer significant for Bitcoin, but it remains significantly different from zero for other assets,\u201d Benigno and Rosa said in the study.\n\n\u201cThis disconnect is puzzling as unexpected changes in discount rates should, in principle, affect the price of bitcoin even when interpreting bitcoin as a purely speculative asset.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the chosen asset for the study because of its popularity and because it is more \u201caccessible and liquid\u201d than other cryptocurrencies, they said.\n\nThe economists analyzed its response to broadly defined macroeconomic data points such as initial jobless claims, industrial production, retail sales, unemployment and news on inflation. Bloomberg consensus forecasts were used to compare market expectations.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s low responsiveness to macro news is in \u201cstark contrast\u201d with other assets the economists used for comparison \u2014 gold, silver, the S&P 500 and a number of bilateral exchange rates.\n\n\u201cAll other traditional assets respond to macroeconomic news with an economically large and significant coefficient,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe economists originally expected bitcoin to respond to monetary policy news as they figured bitcoin is an asset with no intrinsic value, whose current value \u201cdepends on the discounted value of its future price.\u201d\n\nSo, changes in current and future real interest rates, powered by macroeconomic events, should impact its desirability as an investment\n\n\u201cOur analysis instead shows that, while other US asset prices respond to both the target and the path of monetary policy news, Bitcoin is unresponsive to unexpected changes in the short-term rate while its reaction to news about the future path of policy is not robust,\u201d they said.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) last traded around $24,560 as of 11:00 am ET and is down 35% in the last 12 months, but up 50% in the year-to-date period.\n\nThe S&P 500, on the other hand, is down 6.5% over the past year and up 5.2% in 2023 so far.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin fixes broken democracies and fights government corruption by limiting its power to control its people, argues Bitcoin advocate and chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation, Alex Gladstein.\n\nIn a Feb. 20 interview, Gladstein argued that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin (BTC) can act as a barrier against corruption and tyranny.\n\n\"Where the democracies have broken down, I do think it\u2019s very clearly related to fiat currency, and I do think that Bitcoin fixes this in a way,\" he said.\n\nGladstein is the chief strategy officer of HRF and has served the nonprofit organization since 2007. The foundation is focused on promoting and protecting human rights globally \u2014 particularly in countries where its people live \u201cunder authoritarian rule.\"\n\nGladstein also delivers lectures on Bitcoin and the future of money at Singularity University events, according to his bio.\n\nGladstein said during the interview that Bitcoin represents free speech, property rights and open capital markets, all of which are stifling to a tyrannical government, which often needs censorship, confiscation and closed capital markets. He stated:\n\n\u201cThis is what China and Russia need to survive they need censorship, they need close capital markets and they need confiscation; Bitcoin makes it really hard for governments to impose those things on their people.\"\n\nBoth Russia and China have been hostile toward crypto in the past. The Chinese government banned virtually all crypto transactions in 2021. However, the upcoming crypto licensing regime in Hong Kong has led to speculation China\u2019s stance on crypto is softening.\n\nRussia\u2019s major crypto law, \u201cOn Digital Financial Assets,\u201d officially prohibited the use of crypto for payment purposes in 2020. The law did not ban Russians from investing in crypto, but local crypto exchanges have remained unregulated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see these dictatorial powers doing well in a Bitcoin standard; I think it becomes really hard for them,\u201d Gladstein added.\n\nGladstein's argument about crypto has echoed similar views from others in the past. Bitcoin infrastructure provider OpenNode voiced similar opinions in a 2021 post about the benefit that BTC donations had in evading authoritative crackdowns.\n\n\u201cOne of the benefits of Bitcoin is its censorship resistance,\u201d OpenNode wrote at the time.\n\n\u201cWithout any central authority to dictate who can and can\u2019t use Bitcoin, it has proven to be the currency of choice for many individuals and organizations who have been left out of traditional payment methods.\"\n\nAccording to a February 2022 investigation by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, one of the biggest reasons for embracing blockchain-based fundraising was to avoid traditional accounts being closed by financial institutions.\n\nRelated: Blockchain is the only viable path to privacy and censorship resistance in the 21st century\n\nGladstein predicts there will be many more \u201ctrigger moments\u201d in the coming years of people having \u201ctechnical and liquidity trouble with traditional financial services,\u201d which will result in more people shifting to BTC as an alternative.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a conflict or a breakdown in trade or communications, you\u2019re just gonna see a whole hell of a lot of problems, and every single one of those is like a moment that\u2019s gonna mint a new Bitcoiner out of necessity,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Over the course of Bitcoin's (BTC 1.46%) impressive run in the last 14 years, it has proved naysayers wrong time after time as it smashed through previous all-time highs. Since hitting its most recent historic high of around $68,000 in November 2021, the next hope for investors is that its price will one day reach six figures.\n\nPredictions for a $100,000 Bitcoin are common these days. But often they lack substance, evidence, or any legitimate reasoning. Let's try to change that.\n\nTo paint a clearer picture of what might be in store for Bitcoin, our analysis needs to use data. Knowing where Bitcoin has been can help formulate more-realistic estimates on where it could be headed, rather than using wishful thinking.\n\nAs we look at the data, a few things become clear. First, Bitcoin's price behavior is influenced significantly by an event known as a halving. And due to the halving's heavy influence, we can even project when the cryptocurrency will hit a particular price. Before getting into this, though, an understanding of halvings is needed.\n\nA true Bitcoin feature\n\nHalving is what helps make Bitcoin unique due to its role in mining and the creation of new bitcoins. When miners successfully mine a block, they are rewarded with freshly minted bitcoins. This is the primary way that new bitcoins enter circulation.\n\nWhen a halving occurs, it cuts the amount of bitcoins awarded to miners in half, thereby slowing the rate at which new coins enter circulation.\n\nThese halvings take place every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. The first halving occurred in November 2012 and dropped the block reward from 50 bitcoins to 25. The second was in the summer of 2016. And the most recent was in May 2020, resulting in the reward being cut from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins.\n\nWhat Bitcoin could look like by the next halving\n\nAs we analyze the data, it becomes evident that Bitcoin's price at the time of each halving is roughly 50% less than its previous all-time high. This is crucial to understand so that we can more accurately estimate where it could be headed.\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin at the time of the halving is about 50% of the previous all-time high, we can surmise that in May 2024, Bitcoin could be worth around $34,000 based on its current record high of roughly $68,000.\n\nFrom here, we need to look at what happens after the halving. With the halving reducing the rate of new coins entering circulation, Bitcoin's price tends to make its most significant gains after this as the market adjusts to a more limited supply.\n\nWhen we look at Bitcoin's performance after past halvings, two things become clear. On average, Bitcoin returns about 25% less with each new cycle, and a new record high is typically made a year and a half after the halving.\n\nSince we know that the last cycle produced a 670% return, we arrive at around a 500% increase for the coming halving. An increase of this size from our speculative $34,000 price in May 2024 would result in a new all-time high of more than $200,000 sometime in the second half of 2025.\n\nThese estimates and timelines are speculative. But unlike other predictions, this scenario takes data into account and relies on verifiable trends revolving around halvings. Until the data proves otherwise, it is all we can base estimates on.\n\nAs such, with the data's integrity still intact, buying the crypto today could prove to be extremely lucrative since its price hovers at about $25,000.\n\nShould Bitcoin behave like it has in the past and reach our projected $200,000; that would represent an increase of 700% from today's price. Even better, time is on our side: 2025 remains off in the distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Bitcoin Lightning Network growth is organic, coming from real-world adoption - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The capacity of Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network (LN) recently surpassed an all-time high of 5,000 Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe Lightning Network is a neutral protocol built on top of Bitcoin, and it currently does not have a \u201cnative\u201d token attached to it like many decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.\n\nAlthough the Lightning Network\u2019s total liquidity is less than 0.5% of the Ether (ETH) in DeFi contracts, the uptrend in Bitcoin\u2019s LN capacity versus a downtrend in the amount of ETH locked in smart contracts is encouraging for LN development.\n\nTotal ETH locked in DeFi contracts (top) and total BTC in LN channels (bottom). Source: DefiLlama\n\nWhile the liquidity on the LN has been rising consistently, the number of channels on the peer-to-peer network dropped drastically in November following the FTX collapse. It could be due to an exodus of miners operating LN nodes besides running mining clients.\n\nHowever, the likely end of miner capitulation and the rise of Bitcoin-based applications like nonfungible tokens could mark an end to LN channel capitulation. Since the start of 2023, over 2,000 new channels have been added to the network.\n\nLightning Network number of channels. Source: Glassnode\n\nA Valkyrie Investments report states that LN adoption is picking up speed in emerging markets like South America and Africa, primarily due to efforts of the LN mobile payment application Strike.\n\nIn December 2022, the firm launched an LN-based remittance service in Africa. The service offers no-cost transfers from the United States to Africans in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. Later, Strike announced a similar program in the Philippines.\n\nLN capacity and important chronological events. Source: Valkyrie\n\nMore recently, the firm announced dollar payments using LN, where users can potentially send dollars from the Strike\u2019s cash balance to savings and Visa-enabled accounts. The app will convert U.S. dollars to BTC in the background and convert to dollars at the destination. Since LN is fast and cheap, the risk due to Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility is minimal.\n\nThe cost of international payments from the U.S. can reach as high as $45 per transaction, with transfers taking hours or sometimes days. Thus, users may start preferring Strike-based payments over traditional remittance channels.\n\nA recent report from Marty Bent found that the LN payments have risen this year on one of the top Lightning Network wallets, Wallet of Satoshi. Moreover, Podcasting 2.0 \u2014 a podcasting platform that accepts LN payments \u2014 also recorded an uptick in tips sent to creators.\n\nRelated: Retail giant Pick n Pay to accept Bitcoin in 1,628 stores across South Africa\n\nNostr is boosting LN adoption\n\nAnother factor influencing the adoption of LN is the launch of Nostr. According to the protocol\u2019s GitHub page, Nostr is a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, censorship-resistant social media. The protocol allows social media applications to be built on it.\n\nDamus, a Twitter competitor, is built on Nostr and has an iOS and Android application. The idea of an open, free social media network reverberates strongly in the crypto space, with Bitcoin pioneers like Jack Dorsey and Adam Back having strongly endorsed Nostr.\n\nBesides their similarities in ideology, Nostr can boost LN adoption, as Damus has integrated various LN wallets like Wallet of Satoshi, Strike, BlueWallet and others. According to a report from LN analyst Kevin Rooke, over 600,000 users have signed up for Nostr. This could help onboard users to LN, as Nostr supports the Bitcoin payment network through Nostr Zap.\n\nWhile the LN does not have a native token, there is a potential for LN nodes to earn fees for facilitating transactions and providing liquidity. However, in its current state, the earnings are negligible. Hence, the Lightning Network\u2019s growth appears to be organic, and it\u2019s well-positioned to become the leading global payment network \u2014 as prominent personalities in the space have predicted.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "More Than Half Of Bitcoin Mining Is Fueled By Sustainable Power - Markets Insider",
        "content": "This article provides a look at my latest research, revealing how it came to be that a 2022 Cambridge Centre For Alternative Finance\u2019s (CCAF) study on Bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact underestimates the amount of sustainable Bitcoin mining going on. I also address why we can be very confident that the actual sustainable energy usage is at least 52.6% of Bitcoin\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nWhatever your position on ESG investment, the reality is that it\u2019s soaring, on track to reach $10.5 trillion in the U.S. alone. What\u2019s also true is that Bitcoin adoption cannot occur unless this $10.5 trillion of ESG funds feels comfortable that Bitcoin is a net positive to the environment.\n\nRight now, ESG investors largely don\u2019t feel comfortable that this is the case. In speaking with them, my impression is that one reason for ESG investor discomfort with Bitcoin is that the CCAF study, \u201cA Deep Dive Into Bitcoin\u2019s Environmental Impact,\u201d reported that Bitcoin uses only 37.6% sustainable energy.\n\nWhile ESG investors are generally quick to dismiss the work of Bitcoin critic Alex de Vries \u2014 debunked in an earlier Bitcoin Magazine article \u2014 I have found they are also more likely to trust the CCAF study over a Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) study that found Bitcoin uses 58.9% sustainable energy. You can understand why: The Cambridge brand says \u201creputable, independent research,\u201d while BMC\u2019s says, \u201cindustry body.\u201d\n\nIronically, being an industry body, the very thing that gives BMC access to real-time Bitcoin mining data, also made its findings easier for at least some ESG investors to disqualify. Environmental groups such as Earth Justice and journals such as \u201cThe Ecologist\u201d have been similarly quick to assume the CCAF numbers must be the correct ones.\n\nTo date, Bitcoiners have had a muted response. The result: The conversation about ESG funds getting behind Bitcoin cannot progress. Bitcoin user adoption stalls.\n\nMeanwhile, environmental groups gain more fuel to lobby governments to regulate Bitcoin mining in a punitive manner.\n\nWHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR ESG FUNDS TO SUPPORT BITCOIN?\n\nESG funds require three things before they will invest in Bitcoin projects. These are the same three things that the White House would need in order to not punitively regulate Bitcoin mining: independent, empirical data demonstrating unambiguously:\n\nHow the CCAF study came to be understated and by how much That the Bitcoin macro trend is quantifiably moving toward sustainable energy That Bitcoin is quantifiably a net positive to the environment and society\n\nThe research presented here is the answer to the first requirement for ESG investors. It won\u2019t by itself open the floodgates for institutional ESG investment, but it does knock over the first major barriers.\n\nFINDINGS\n\nThroughout 2022, I was perplexed about the consistent, 20%-plus difference between the BMC and CCAF estimates of Bitcoin\u2019s sustainable energy use. I saw both the Bitcoin community and environmental groups quote the figure that fit their narratives.\n\nBeing in the unusual position of straddling both communities, my simple question was, \u201cWho\u2019s right?\u201d\n\nI decided to research the question.\n\nWhat I realized was that the CCAF model was excluding several factors. No great detective work on my part: It says so on its website under the \u201cLimitations Of The Model\u201d section.\n\nSo, I quantified the impact of these exclusions. It turned out that the three exclusions mentioned on its website cause its model to understate Bitcoin\u2019s sustainable energy percentage by 13.6%. This explains two-thirds of the entire variance between the CCAF and the BMC model.\n\nWhen all exclusions from the CCAF model are factored in, the Bitcoin sustainable energy percentage figure is a full 15.5% higher.\n\nHere\u2019s a full breakdown of all of the CCAF model exclusions. There are nine exclusions in total: seven (in green) that increase the sustainable energy-use figure; two (in red) that decrease it. A full evaluation of each factor and the methodology used to quantify exclusions can be found on my research site.\n\nSo, in summary, the CCAF model does not factor in:\n\nOff-grid mining (impact: plus 10.8%)\n\nFlare-gas mining (impact: plus 1.0%)\n\nUpdated geographical hash rate (Kazakhstan miner exodus, impact: plus 1.8%)\n\nWith all exclusions factored in, the sustainable energy mix calculation is 52.6%. This figure represents a lower-bound estimate, so it is not incompatible with the BMC study showing 58.9% sustainable energy.\n\nHOW CONFIDENT CAN WE BE THAT BITCOIN\u2019S ENERGY USE IS OVER 50%?\n\nWe can simulate this using the revised model. For Bitcoin\u2019s true sustainable energy use to be below 50%, at least one of the following scenarios would have to be true:\n\nFour large Bitcoin mining operations secretly run off 100% coal-based energy\n\nERCOT (The operator of Texas\u2019s electricity grid) has over-reported its true renewable energy numbers by a factor of four\n\nDespite the widely-reported exodus of miners from Kazakhstan, its claim on Bitcoin mining actually increased its share of global hash rate from 13.2% to 20%\n\nI would rate the chance of any of these being true as far fetched. As for the likelihood that the true sustainable percentage of the Bitcoin network is 37.6%, there is a higher likelihood of you winning first prize in a single-ticket entry lottery where every man, woman and child in the U.S. has a ticket.\n\nWHAT DOES THIS NEW RESEARCH MEAN FOR BITCOIN\u2019S ESG NARRATIVE\n\nThree things:\n\n1. It won\u2019t stop mainstream media from quoting the Cambridge study or environmental groups from using it. But it will make a difference to how ESG investors look at Bitcoin. For the first time, Bitcoin advocates have a legitimate, data-based way to remove the roadblock that the CCAF study has for some time created in the minds of ESG investors.\n\nPast the first hurdle, proponents of Bitcoin can ask the next two big questions that ESG investors and the White House have: Is Bitcoin\u2019s macro-trend quantifiably moving toward sustainable energy? And is Bitcoin quantifiably a net positive to the environment and society?\n\n2. It also means that previous CCAF findings that appear to have used the same partial data set will need to be revisited. Specifically, we will need to revisit its findings that:\n\nBitcoin emissions are currently 58.58 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) (likely overstated)\n\nBitcoin uses less sustainable energy since the China ban (likely to show a different trend once off-grid mining is factored in)\n\nEmissions intensity may be increasing (for the same reason as the above)\n\nThe major energy used by the Bitcoin network is coal (in light of off-grid data, it is unclear if there is sufficient evidence for this conclusion)\n\nInitial calculations suggest that all four findings may be incorrect. This will need further analysis before we can say this with confidence. I\u2019ll do that in separate pieces of work.\n\n3. To the best of my knowledge, all other major industries are significantly behind Bitcoin in their use of sustainable energy. Bitcoin can legitimately claim to be leading all other industries in its adoption of sustainable energy sources. This is a very strong ESG case, because it shows an industry taking leadership in the renewable transition, which has the potential to inspire other industries by example.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that Bitcoin has achieved this feat in the remarkably quick time of just 14 years.\n\nIn summary: One of the three hurdles to institutional adoption of Bitcoin on ESG grounds effectively no longer exists. Both Bitcoin advocates and ESG investors can now feel confident that Bitcoin is predominantly sustainable.\n\nFINAL WORDS\n\nThroughout the process, I was in contact with both Alexander Neumueller, the digital assets project lead at CCAF, and Michael Saylor, the founder of BMC. Each was both encouraging and supportive of the approach I was taking.\n\nTo my knowledge, CCAF was the first to create energy and emission data for the Bitcoin network using a valid methodology and high-integrity data. I use both its energy consumption index (CBECI) and its mining map extensively in my own research and have found both the methodology and the data of these two tools to be sound. It is only the sustainable energy percentages where I found that an underestimation was occurring.\n\nWhen CCAF first started calculating the sustainable energy use of the Bitcoin network in late 2019, it was highly accurate. It is the subsequent proliferation of largely renewable-based, off-grid mining, flare-gas mining and rapid miner movement from Kazakhstan and to Texas that saw its model start to lose tune. As any quant trader can tell you, \u201ceven a great algorithm will lose tune over time.\u201d\n\nBy Daniel Batten via Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nDemographic Challenges Weigh On Russia\u2019s Military Ambitions\n\nSemiconductors Have An Emissions Problem\n\nNorway\u2019s Oil Production Dropped In January\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nThis story originally appeared on Oilprice.com"

        "content": "The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has long taken a cautious approach to Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. However, there is no need for caution anymore as the \u201cbattle has been won\u201d between fiat and crypto, according to BIS.\n\nBIS general manager Agust\u00edn Carstens, who made the claim, highlighted that \u201ctechnology doesn\u2019t make for trusted money,\u201d among further criticisms of crypto in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nCrypto has lost the argument that it's an alternative to fiat currency, the head of the Bank for International Settlements says https://t.co/xZKFHEj3b2 \u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) February 22, 2023\n\nAs the central bank for central banks, the BIS has emphasized the need for regulation and risk management in the crypto space, but claiming the crypto vs. fiat battle has been won sparked outrage, satire and corrections among the Bitcoin and crypto community.\n\nRay Youssef, CEO of Paxful and vocal Bitcoin maximalist, told Cointelegraph that it\u2019s \u201ceasy to get sucked into these battles but is all a distraction with no ROI.\u201c He continued, \u201cWe must focus on the battles in the global south and fight for every inch and every eyeball. What is happening in Nigeria now is vital for us all.\u201c\n\n\u201cWant to p*ss the clowns off? Ignore their FUD bait and focus all in on the global south and what is happening on the streets of nigeria.\u201c\n\nSaifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, brought Carsten\u2019s statement to his followers\u2019 attention, provoking condemnation and concern in the comments. Florida-based Bitcoin advocate SVN (not his real name), whose frozen bank account prompted a switch to go all in on Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph, \u201cthese people are clowns.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Lady Anarki, a Bitcoin advocate who recently closed a Bitcoin Security Education company, explained that \u201cfiat and crypto are essentially the same exact scam.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor fiat, it is nefarious elite oligarchs creating a rigged game system to enrich themselves while making everyone else poorer. Bitcoin is a technology designed with incentives and sound economic principles that enriches anyone who brings value to the world.\u201d\n\nBitcoin losing the \u201cwar\u201d for money, as Carstens explained, is another reference to the fact that Bitcoin has been declared dead, dead and dead again. The 2022 and 2023 bear market is no different, and Bitcoin advocates on Twitter seized the opportunity to mock financial experts dancing on the imaginary grave of the decentralized currency.\n\nNonetheless, Bitcoin is up over 40% from its 2022 lows, and Lightning Network adoption flourishes while the community appears increasingly vocal.\n\nWhat Bitcoin Did, the popular podcast hosted by Peter McCormack, tweeted some handy statistics to correct another inflammatory statement published by the BIS this week. Notably, from August 2015 to December 2022, the BIS explained that \u201cnearly all economies made losses on their Bitcoin holdings.\u201d\n\nBIS analysis: Aug \u201815-Dec \u201822 \u201cmajority\u2026in nearly all economies made losses on their #Bitcoin holdings\u201d\n\n\n\nFacts:\n\n-Majority of global fiat lost value to USD since 2015\n\n-USD has lost over 26% of its own value due to inflation#Bitcoin has gone up nearly 8000%\n\n\n\nFacts be sticky pic.twitter.com/mMyBzuVhWz \u2014 What Bitcoin Did (@WhatBitcoinDid) February 21, 2023\n\nAs shown, the Bitcoin price continues to trend higher despite the BIS\u2019 best efforts to the contrary.\n\nThe BIS has been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about their volatility, scalability and energy consumption. However, the BIS has researched stablecoins and spearheads the development of central bank digital currencies in partnership with several countries, juxtaposing Carsten\u2019s comment in the Bloomberg interview that tech \u201cdoesn\u2019t make for trusted money.\u201d\n\nRelated: Coinbase staking \u2018fundamentally different\u2019 to Kraken\u2019s \u2014 chief lawyer\n\nWillem Middelkoop, author and Bitcoin advocate, highlighted that the war between fiat and crypto is far from over. A cursory scroll through the comments on the original tweet from Bloomberg Crypto would suggest that the war is just heating up."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) hodlers need to watch the central banks of China and Japan as well as the United States as BTC/USD battles \u201chuge\u201d resistance.\n\nThat was the opinion of trading firm QCP Capital, which in its latest crypto market research piece, \u201cThe Crypto Circular,\u201d warned that Bitcoin faces risks far beyond the Federal Reserve.\n\nBitcoin \u201cmost direct global liquidity proxy\u201d\n\nHaving survived the latest flood of macroeconomic data from the U.S., Bitcoin is nonetheless flagging right below $25,000 as bulls run out of momentum.\n\nFor QCP Capital, there is now reason to believe that risk factors for price performance will come not just from the Fed \u2014 but China and Japan.\n\nMarket participants must now contend with such issues as China\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) as well as the U.S. equivalent, along with Japanese central bank policy changes.\n\n\u201cWhile the jury is out on BTC\u2019s value as an inflation hedge, it cannot be denied that it is the most direct global liquidity proxy, as it is not tied to any one central bank or nation,\u201d the research argues.\n\nBitcoin is sensitive to global liquidity, and when central banks inject it, this marks an incentive for growth in and of itself. That argument is already popular, with others also eyeing how \u201cliquidity junkie\u201d Bitcoin will navigate changes in central bank liquidity this year.\n\n\u201cAnd while we were focused on USD liquidity \u2014 from the Fed\u2019s QT and Reserve balance, we\u2019ve missed the massive liquidity injection by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) over the past 3 months,\u201d QCP continues.\n\n\u201cContrary to consensus, central banks have net added $1 trillion of liquidity since the market\u2019s bottom in October 2022, with the PBOC and BOJ the largest contributors.\u201d\n\nQCP refers to the dichotomy between U.S. policy and China and Japan \u2014 quantitative tightening (QT) versus quantitative easing (QE). Regardless of what the Fed does, extra liquidity in one place is all but guaranteed to trickle into risk assets such as crypto.\n\n\u201cHence, such a large injection of liquidity will no doubt find its way to crypto, even despite what appears to be the current US administration\u2019s best efforts to prevent that,\u201d it says.\n\nVersus net $1 trillion of liquidity injections, the Fed has reduced its balance sheet to its lowest levels since September 2021.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that apart from US data and Fed guidance now, which ultimately still holds the highest beta for market moves, we also have to be conscious of BOJ and PBOC liquidity injections,\u201d QCP writes.\n\n\u201cAny reversal of liquidity from these 2 sources would remove the underlying support that BTC has seen this past month.\u201d\n\nFed balance sheet chart (screenshot).

        "content": "GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. logo\n\nConversion Vertically Integrates Bitcoin Depot Hardware and Software, Significantly Reduces Operating Cost, Provides Flexibility for New Functionality\n\nBitcoin Depot Kiosk\n\nBitcoin Depot announced today that all of its roughly 7,000 kiosks have been converted to Bitaccess software, the premier software suite for Bitcoin ATM operations.\n\nATLANTA, Feb. 22, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lux Vending, LLC dba Bitcoin Depot\u00ae (\u201cBitcoin Depot\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator and leading fintech company, announced today that all of its roughly 7,000 kiosks have been converted to BitAccess Inc. (\u201cBitaccess\u201d) software, the premier software suite for Bitcoin ATM operations.\n\nBitcoin Depot previously announced in late 2022 its acquisition of a majority equity interest in Bitaccess. The completion of the conversion vertically integrates Bitcoin Depot\u2019s hardware and software, eliminating previous annual software licensing fees which accounted for over $3 million of operating costs during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. The investment in Bitaccess has also created flexibility for Bitcoin Depot to develop new lines of business involving its kiosks while providing a seamless experience between its app and Bitcoin ATMs. Bitcoin Depot\u2019s majority interest in Bitaccess has enabled Bitcoin Depot to build out its BDCheckout product and its other software and operational capabilities and has expanded its revenue streams into kiosk management software, which includes various compliance systems, transaction processing and cash management capabilities.\n\n\u201cThis is the one of the first software conversions of this scale in the industry and a major accomplishment for our company,\u201d said Brandon Mintz, CEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot. \u201cOur vertical integration strengthens our market position and fortifies our value proposition to customers and investors. We\u2019re thrilled to see the results of this endeavor streamline our operations, reduce costs, and ultimately benefit our customers.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Depot\u2019s VP of BTM Operations, Jason Sacco, and its Head of Product, Bill Knoll, led the project using in-house technical support and various third parties. Prior to joining Bitcoin Depot in 2020, Sacco and Knoll each gained over 15 years of relevant experience with a global cash ATM company, where they orchestrated a number of successful software and hardware conversions.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe streamlined the process to convert Bitcoin Depot\u2019s Bitcoin ATMs to Bitaccess software during a testing phase, which allowed us to reduce the software conversion process in the field,\u201d said Sacco. \u201cBy swapping out the existing hard drive with one preloaded with Bitaccess software we quickly completed the software conversion while avoiding certain technical issues that can happen in field conversion projects. We efficiently converted approximately the first 6,000 of Bitcoin Depot\u2019s Bitcoin ATMs in 10 weeks.\u201d\n\nBitaccess offers software support not only for Bitcoin Depot\u2019s Bitcoin ATMs but can also be deployed in other operators\u2019 Bitcoin ATMs. The feature rich software allows operators white label opportunities and the ability to reduce the number of other software-related vendors needed due to its expanded, built-in functionality relative to other products. Additionally, Bitaccess has historically charged a lower software licensing fee to Bitcoin ATM operators based on transaction volume, compared to other software providers, and offers volume discounts.\n\nThis conversion makes Bitcoin Depot one of the first companies in the industry to complete a full software conversion across more than a few hundred Bitcoin ATMs. Based on industry data only a handful of Bitcoin ATM companies are vertically integrated, meaning they own their own software and operate their own Bitcoin ATMs, but there are over 550 Bitcoin ATM operators worldwide as of February 20, 2023, according to Coinatmradar.com.1 There are currently close to 8,000 total Bitcoin ATMs using Bitaccess software, including those operated by Bitcoin Depot, which gives Bitaccess a market share of approximately 21% worldwide as of February 20, 2023, calculated based on data from Coinatmradar.com.2\n\nAbout Bitcoin Depot\n\nBitcoin Depot was founded in 2016 with the mission to connect those who prefer to use cash to the broader, digital financial system. Bitcoin Depot provides its users with simple, efficient and intuitive means of converting cash into Bitcoin, which users can deploy in the payments, spending and investing space. Users can convert cash to Bitcoin at Bitcoin Depot\u2019s kiosks and at thousands of name-brand retail locations through BDCheckout.

        "content": "The January launch of Bitcoin Ordinals created a stir within the crypto community about its place within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Users are debating whether they offer new use cases for Bitcoin or if it takes away from BTC\u2019s peer-to-peer cash system vision.\n\nNo matter the community sentiment on the Bitcoin-based nonfungibale token (NFT) issue, this did not stop Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Luxor Mining from acquiring OrdinalHub, the primary platform for Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nThe announcement came on Feb. 20, with 150,000 inscriptions (Ordinals) already made, a 15000% increase from the beginning of the month.\n\nLuxor highlighted the fact that the current state of Bitcoin Ordinals being minted and \u201cescrowed\u201d through various Discord servers has made it difficult for collectors and creators to keep track of all of the projects. It claims the OrdinalHub will tackle this issue as a \u201ccentral hub\u201d for the community.\n\nNick Hansen, the CEO of Luxor, praised the innovative qualities of Ordinals and how they can create \u201csynergies between the firm\u2019s mining pool and the OridinalHub.\n\n\u201cOrdinals have opened the door for exciting new monetization strategies for Bitcoin miners.\u201c\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin miners have already made around $600,000 from Ordinals\u2019 NFT transactions. Moreover, Bitcoin-based NFT inscriptions now take over 50% of Bitcoin block space.\n\nRelated: Will the Bitcoin mining industry collapse? Analysts explain why crisis is really opportunity\n\nOrdinalHub posted about the acquisition on Twitter on Feb. 22, to which users responded with generally positive sentiments toward the development.\n\nReally excited to see the top notch team at @LuxorTechTeam really lean into the space with this move. I've had a blast helping build parts of @ordinalhub behind the scenes. I'll see you all on the freshly launched OrdinalHub discord https://t.co/paMwrM1DT9 \u2014 cbspears \u26cf\u2699\ufe0f (@cbspears) February 21, 2023\n\nHowever, some users remained skeptical about the acquisition and the Ordinal buzz in general, saying the \u201chype might be over.\u201d\n\nOrdinal punks floor continues to fall precipitously. Arguably the most recognizable ordinals. The ordinals hype phase might be over, reality setting in. Just another 2023 PND \u2014 Doc Crypto (@doccrypto777) February 22, 2023\n\nStandard NFTs have gone through hype cycles, which was at a low by the end of 2022. However, according to a recent DappRadar report, they are slowly making a comeback after a 37% increase in transactions from December 2022 to January 2023."

        "title": "Advanced Bitcoin Chain Opens Crypto Mining - 24-7 Press Release",
        "content": "BETTER Algorithm... GREATER Earnings!\n\nSEATTLE, WA, February 21, 2023 /24-7PressRelease/ -- The Advanced Bitcoin Center is pleased to announce the official launch of its Advanced Bitcoin Chain for cryptocurrency mining. This chain utilizes a distinct algorithm that differs from those used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\n\nBy integrating Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, the Advanced Bitcoin Chain has created a more effective algorithm, allowing miners to extract up to 14,400 Advanced Bitcoin (aBTC) each day.\n\n\n\nBased on the public transaction history of aBTC since 2022, the average value of each aBTC typically ranges from $200.00 to $350,000.\n\n\n\nConsequently, mining aBTC on the Advanced Bitcoin Chain is exceptionally profitable. The aBTC miners have the potential to mine around $4.32 million to $5.04 billion worth of Advanced Bitcoin per day.\n\n\n\nCompared to traditional Bitcoin, the main features of Advanced Bitcoin can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n1) It can run normally and efficiently on a regular personal computer, unlike traditional Bitcoin, which requires a professional mining computer with unprecedented computing power to function.\n\n\n\n2) Compared to the daily power consumption of a personal computer, there is virtually no additional power consumption when running the Advanced Bitcoin Wallet for mining.\n\n\n\n3) Compared to the normal noise of a personal computer, there is virtually no additional computer noise when running the Advanced Bitcoin Wallet for mining.\n\n\n\n4) Compared to the normal heat generated by a personal computer, there is virtually no additional heat when running the Advanced Bitcoin Wallet for mining.\n\n\n\n5) The block generation speed of the Advanced Bitcoin Blockchain is 10 times faster than that of traditional Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n6) The cryptocurrency generation speed of the Advanced Bitcoin Blockchain is 16 times faster than that of traditional Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n7) The blockchain transaction verification speed of the Advanced Bitcoin Blockchain is 45 times faster than that of traditional Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n8) Compared to the 3-7 transactions per second (TPS) that can be processed by traditional Bitcoin blockchain, the TPS of the Advanced Bitcoin blockchain is around 100,000-1,000,000 transactions per second, which is more than 10,000-140,000 times faster than traditional Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\n\n9) The Advanced Bitcoin Wallet is designed to produce up to 1 billion units of Advanced Bitcoin (aBTC) over a period of approximately 190 years. This quantity represents a 47.62-fold increase over the maximum amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that can be generated through conventional Bitcoin mining equipment, which is capped at 21 million BTC.\n\n\n\nHow to mine Advanced Bitcoin?\n\n\n\nMining is the process by which new Advanced Bitcoins are generated. While it differs significantly from physical mining for precious metals like gold, the comparison does hold in that digital currency miners use computers to solve cryptographic problems and receive a reward in the form of cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nTo begin mining Advanced Bitcoin on the Advanced Bitcoin Chain, miners will require a dedicated Advanced Bitcoin wallet and a computer.\n\n\n\nDue to the advantages offered by the Advanced Bitcoin Chain, the Advanced Bitcoin Center is now offering mining opportunities to interested parties. This includes mining companies and cryptocurrency enthusiasts who have sufficient funds to engage in crypto mining.\n\n\n\nMining parties that are approved by the Advanced Bitcoin Center will be authorized to utilize its Advanced Bitcoin wallet to mine aBTC on a 24/7/365 basis.\n\n\n\nThe Advanced Bitcoin Chain, as the latest innovative blockchain in the world, commenced mining operations on February 14, 2023. It effectively combines the algorithmic advantages of both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, resulting in an impressive maximum transaction processing speed of up to 1,000,000 transactions per second. This makes it a more advanced blockchain technology compared to traditional Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe Advanced Bitcoin Wallet is a professional application developed by the Advanced Bitcoin Center in the United States to replace the high-pollution, high-energy consumption traditional Bitcoin and its blockchain with the newly lunched Advanced Bitcoin Chain. It is primarily used to mine Advanced Bitcoin, store Advanced Bitcoin, make payments with Advanced Bitcoin, and verify transactions of Advanced Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe Advanced Bitcoin Center is the developer of Advanced Bitcoin related blockchain products.

Playfulness, experimentation, innovation. Not taking ourselves so god damn seriously all the time. HAVING FUN, for Satoshi\u2019s sake. I truly believe that with ordinals we finally have a chance to do this.\u201d\n\nAustralian cocktail bar launches NFT membership program\n\nAustralian cocktail and NFT connoisseurs have a new venue in Sydney to haunt \u2014 one that allows holders of its NFTs access to additional privileges at the bar.\n\nThe Sydney-based cocktail bar, Bar Lulu, launched on Feb. 21, along with an NFT members club bar named Cryptolulu.\n\nBased in Sydney, patrons must buy the NFT member club bar on NFT marketplace OpenSea on the Ethereum network to access certain privileges.\n\nNFT Artist Credit: Arturo Rodriguez and Mark Monfort.

Australian software engineer Anthony Guerrera said it was \u201cquite simple\u201d and that he was motivated to make the fork due to a 22 Litecoin (LTC) bounty.\n\nReal Vision co-founder and CEO Raoul Pal stated on Feb. 20 that NFTs will act similarly to high-end property in the traditional economy and potentially outperform ETH during bull markets.\n\nThe former JPMorgan executive explained that NFT collections, such as CryptoPunks and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), had become status symbols, much like luxury cars and houses, and he expects that trend to continue."

Secure your seat today\n\nDevelopers are forking Bitcoin ordinals to give older proof-of-work networks such as Litecoin their first set of non-fungible tokens (NFT). Over the weekend, Bitcoin developer Anthony Gurrera forked the code behind Bitcoin Ordinals to the Litecoin blockchain \u2013 placing a copy of the latter\u2019s mimblewimble upgrade white paper to the Litecoin network, making it the first NFT on Litecoin, in effect.\n\nThe effort likely stemmed from a public bounty of 15 litecoin (LTC) tokens by one Crypto Twitter user to any developer who could fork Ordinals to the Litecoin blockchain. \u201cRules: Must work with Litecoin Core 0.21.2.1. Submit the Github repo below. First successful submission to port to Litecoin wins,\u201d Twitter user Indigo said.\n\nStory continues\n\nOrdinals Protocol, which enables users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, essentially creating Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens.\n\nAlready, one report from research firm FSInsight argues that an Ordinals-driven resurgence in development and the expansion in the total value transacted and secured over the Bitcoin blockchain should drive up its price.\n\nAs such, the Litecoin ordinals are open source, meaning anyone can make changes to the code and upgrade the code.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Ordinals are proving to be fairly successful, despite initially creating drama among purist developers in the Bitcoin community. Dune Analytics data shows over 153,000 inscriptions \u2013 a term for unique tokens on Ordinals \u2013 have been created in just over three weeks after launch, with more than 5,000 created daily on average."

Amanda has numerous interests across Bitcoin, from investments to mining, from advocacy to education. As a veteran Bitcoiner, Amanda is able to have a wider perspective on the important value Bitcoin brings to society beyond its immediate investment potential.\n\nWe discussed the unremitting importance of Bitcoin to privacy, and of privacy to democracy. With the rise of China, having a tool outside of the purview of the state is becoming increasingly important. Furthermore, Bitcoin has the potential to support global economic growth as we transition from the dollar as a reserve currency: Bitcoin has the potential to be neutral global money that can enable efficient cross-border payments in an increasingly multipolar world.\n\nWe talked about despite Bitcoin being an apolitical tool, there is significant work required to get it to resonate within the Washington bubble. Amanda set out the educational work, network building and soft permeation of DC being undertaken by the Bitcoin Today Coalition. This is a slow but vital advocacy process needed to lessen the risk Bitcoin\u2019s development within the United States is kneecapped by ignorant legislators.\n\nFinally, we covered the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s culture. Whilst \u2018number goes up\u2019 worked to gain rapid interest over previous cycles, a values-based ideology is showing itself to be critical in both widening Bitcoin adoption and defending against attacks. But culture obviously affects the internal workings of Bitcoin as much as its presentation externally. Therefore, the current debate around how radical Bitcoin should be may perhaps become a significant area of debate in the next year."

Discover SCENE\n\nSTX, the native token powering the Bitcoin-adjacent Stacks blockchain, has gained 19% overnight, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nAt press time, STX is changing hands at roughly $0.70, slightly lower from its 180-day high of $0.75, reached earlier today.\n\nOn a weekly note, STX is up a whopping 132%. The weekly gains not only handed hefty profits to short-term holders but also helped the coin regain its billion-dollar market capitalization.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite the week\u2019s positive rally, STX is still down 78% from its historical all-time high of $3.39 in December 2021.\n\nLaunched in 2017, Stacks is built on top of Bitcoin, allowing developers to build and deploy smart contracts secured by the original blockchain network.\n\nIn simpler terms, Stacks operates much like Ethereum with a link to the Bitcoin blockchain through proof-of-transfer (PoX) consensus.

        "content": "Bitcoin is the first and most important cryptocurrency created. It provides the security and payment opportunities that most banks lack and, simultaneously, allows people who don\ufffdt have the convenience of using the services of such financial institutions. China, for example, is the country with the most people without a bank account.\n\nBitcoin is the first and most important cryptocurrency created. It provides the security and payment opportunities that most banks lack and, simultaneously, allows people who don\ufffdt have the convenience of using the services of such financial institutions. China, for example, is the country with the most people without a bank account. And although China is among the countries that use Bitcoin the most, since it has no clear regulations, it has banned related transactions. Other areas, like Venezuela, struggle with their fiat currency, which is why they\ufffdve accepted bitcoin more recently.\n\nThere are still challenges for this cryptocurrency. But the BTC price remains steady, and the network is one of the best choices for businesses that want to expand their transactional resources. Some companies have already started accepting bitcoin as a payment method. From that point, many other significant organizations followed the trend, which is why we\ufffdll discuss some of them in the following paragraphs.\n\nPixabay\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft, the biggest software manufacturing company, started accepting bitcoin payments as far back as 2014, only five years after the cryptocurrency\ufffds market release. The organization partnered with BitPay, a known bitcoin payment service. The collaboration allowed customers to buy apps and games for Windows Phone, Xbox and even their Windows operating system. Microsoft\ufffds purpose was to give users more options for doing more on their devices and the cloud.\n\nBut that\ufffds not the only thing Microsoft adopted. The company also started experimenting with blockchain technology as it launched its first blockchain product in 2015 called Azure Blockchain Service, which would allow building applications in the network without managing infrastructure. Although the project was closed due to low offer interest, Windows is still testing new blockchain solutions.\n\nBurger King\n\nThe internationally successful Burger King restaurant had the first cryptocurrency test back in 2017 when the Russian subdivision of the company issued the WhooperCoin tokens in the Waves blockchain that would be offered to customers at every purchase. Although the project failed, other Burger King branches started to accept Bitcoin payments, such as in the Netherlands, Germany, Venezuela, Brazil and more.\n\nNowadays, you can buy Whoppers with Bitcoin through virtual debit cards. Lately, Burger King started to partner up with Cryptobuyer, another cryptocurrency payment processor through which the company now accepts six different cryptocurrencies in Venezuela, such as Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash.\n\nKFC\n\nAnother important business in the fast-food industry, KFC, started accepting bitcoin as payment back in 2018. It all started in KFC Canada, where customers could pay, for a limited time, for the Bitcoin fried chicken bucket that would cost a little over $27. The buckets were delivered directly to people\ufffds home addresses, while the transactions were processed through BitPay.\n\nHowever, it\ufffds not clear at the moment if the giant company still accepts bitcoin as an optional payment form, but other Yum! Brands, Inc. businesses, such as Pizza Hut, allow bitcoin payments, but only in some regions, Like Venezuela, where the Venezuelan bolivar lost almost all value.\n\nTwitch\n\nTwitch has become one of the best and most used streaming platforms, especially around the pandemic. As owners saw the potential in this organization, they allowed cryptocurrency transactions via BitPay, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Dogecoin and Litecoin.\n\nThis method is beneficial for streamers since they can accept crypto donations and support their channel. By including crypto donations, streamers address a larger audience, provide multiple options for people with different types of coins, and have the opportunity to invest or liquidate these coins. Accepting crypto transfers is done through NOWPayments, and users can generate a crypto donation link to share it with their audience.\n\nNorwegian AIR\n\nNorwegian AIR is a major low-cost airline from Norway that plans to offer Bitcoin payments. They have already set up a crypto exchange plan so that customers can purchase tickets through their payment infrastructure. However, since the company faced issues after extensive cost cuts, the bitcoin payment option might take some time to develop fully.\n\nThe business has created a Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) that would roll out exchanges in other countries. The platform was planned to integrate the company\ufffds existing rewards program so that customers could earn points by trading on the exchange. With these points, clients can swap for a discount on tickets.\n\nExpress VPN\n\nExpress VPN is known as the best online security and data protection services on the market at the moment. It\ufffds also one of the few companies clearly stating their bitcoin payment option. Customers only need to provide their email addresses to sign up for these transactions without other essential information. The company allows for bitcoin transactions through BitPay, but other electronic wallets are also accepted.\n\nExpress VPN also proves an array of cryptocurrencies people can pay with, such as Ethereum, XRP, USDC, PAX AND GUSD stablecoins. The company has already been accepting bitcoin payments since 2014, but it is constantly expanding its payment area and developing its user privacy statements.\n\nStarbucks\n\nFinally, Starbucks is among the companies that allow customers to use bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies to pay for their coffee. In 2018, the business announced its partnering with the crypto platform Bakkt. Through this process, people could convert their cryptocurrencies into US dollars. The partnership had the purpose of helping the company convert consumer Bitcoins and select other digital assets to US dollars.\n\nThe Starbucks app integrates with Bitcoin wallets, and clients state that transactions are fast. Given that the company utilizes a PoS blockchain technology powered by Polygon, this less-energy solution is also one of the most efficient. Starbucks has also explored other facilities on the blockchain to offer customers another way to engage with the web3 experience.\n\nWrapping up\n\nBitcoin has yet to become a worldwide accepted cryptocurrency but is already one of the most used by investors and regular people. Therefore, many major companies have already added a bitcoin payment option to their systems so that an extended target audience can pay with their bitcoins fast and easily. At the same time, these businesses are also using blockchain technologies to dig into web3 experiences.\n\nStay updated with all the insights.\n\nNavigate news, 1 email day.\n\nSubscribe to Qrius"

        "title": "How to build a crypto portfolio without spending any money or time trading - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Starting to invest in cryptocurrency does not necessarily require connecting with a bank account or spending fiat to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Another way to earn cryptocurrency and build a portfolio is to complete a variety of tasks on various Web3 platforms.\n\nUsing decentralized applications and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, users can earn cryptocurrency and then swap, sell or hold it in centralized or decentralized wallets without even having to spend money.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few ways to build a crypto portfolio without connecting a bank account.\n\nInteract with Web3 browsers\n\nA person without cryptocurrency knowledge might be intimidated by the process of downloading wallets and performing on-chain transactions. An alternative is simply interacting with technology, and currently, there are multiple ways to experiment with different crypto platforms. One is replacing Web2 technology with a Web3 counterpart browser.\n\nGoogle dominates the web browser and search engine space, making money off users by selling data to advertisers. The Brave browser is an alternative platform where users earn Basic Attention Token (BAT) and fully own their data while searching. Users earn from their activity on advertisers\u2019 websites, and Brave does not sponsor search engine posts, which provides users with a more decentralized search experience.\n\nCurrently, Brave shares 70% of its advertising revenue, and some users choose to sell their earned BAT on centralized exchanges or through Web3 wallets like MetaMask.\n\nSocial media content creation and free NFT mints\n\nNFTs continue to grow in popularity, and potential crypto investors can use a variety of free software to analyze the wallet addresses of successful NFT investors that minted high-value NFTs and also try to find free NFT minting and whitelist opportunities.\n\nAI Birds minting overview with notable groups. Source: DegenMint\n\nColin Helm, CEO of a free-to-play metaverse platform Caesarverse, noted the importance of free NFTs in the space:\n\n\u201cIf users follow social media and community channels closely, they can always find very generous raffles, gain some assets that improve their gameplay experience and build their crypto portfolio just from playing games they may enjoy.\u201d\n\nSome users that have worked the free minting system have generated NFTs that eventually reached a 10 ETH floor.\n\nRelated: How to do mobile cryptocurrency mining?\n\nSimilar to how NFTs require a social media base for advertising, new blockchains and protocols also require immense amounts of testing and a user base in order to ensure sustainable growth at launch.\n\nSome blockchains like Arbitrum do not have a token, but the hint of an eventual airdrop tends to attract users to the protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOn Sept. 6, 2022, 1inch users on Optimism received an airdrop of 300,000 OP for their prelaunch usage of the blockchain.\n\nFor users without the technical knowledge to use new blockchains, social activity-based airdrops could be an easier way to earn cryptocurrency. With social airdrops, users may have to follow, like and share certain accounts on social media. Users will most likely need to use a decentralized wallet like MetaMask in order to receive social airdrops.\n\nBug bounties and beta tests\n\nMany crypto and DeFi projects have set tokens aside for marketing, bug finding, beta testing and content creation tasks. Many crypto investors earn tokens by auditing, testing, and creating brand designs, marketing materials, music and other content. Lending one\u2019s skills to crypto projects is a perfect way to get started.\n\nJenny \u201cDJen\u201d Schorsch, founder of GlamJam, shared her experience regarding how she built a brand and started in crypto without upfront costs:\n\n\u201cStart by creating value for the community for free first. After you have your community, you start generating profit and assets with them. I started using NFTs for ticketing and allowed Web3 companies sponsorships for my favorite projects. Before I knew it, people were offering me crypto for participation in events.\u201d\n\nWhile most users think that a bank account and fiat currency are necessary for interacting with blockchains and cryptocurrency, this is not the case.\n\nWith a little effort, aspiring crypto investors can earn cryptocurrency and NFTs without any upfront cost, other than time.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "With close to 3,000 different cryptocurrencies in the market right now, it\u2019s clear that despite their volatile nature, they are here to stay. But did you know almost all cryptocurrencies were born from the same concept?\n\nNearly all cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology. Also referred to as the shared ledger, given its distributed nature, blockchain is considered one of the most secure digital technologies.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain?\n\nBlockchain is a list of records called blocks that store data publicly and in chronological order. The information is encrypted using cryptography to ensure that the privacy of the user is not compromised and data cannot be altered.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nInformation on a Blockchain network is not controlled by a centralized authority, unlike modern financial institutions. The participants of the network maintain the data, and they hold the democratic authority to approve any transaction which can happen on a Blockchain network. Therefore, a typical Blockchain network is a public Blockchain.\n\nAs long as you have access to the network, you have access to the data within the Blockchain. If you are a participant in the Blockchain network, you will have the same copy of the ledger, which all other participants have. Even if one node or data on one particular participant computer gets corrupted, the other participants will be alerted immediately, and they can rectify it as soon as possible.\n\nTo understand the promise of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies and their advantages over traditional (fiat) currencies, let\u2019s look at the issues inherent in fiat currency first.\n\nHow Does Blockchain Work?\n\nBlockchain is a combination of three important technologies - cryptographic keys, a peer-to-peer network, and a digital ledger. The cryptographic keys are of two types - private key and public key. Each individual or node has both of these keys and they are used to create a digital signature.\n\nThis digital signature is a unique and secure digital identity reference and the most important aspect of blockchain technology. Every transaction is authorized by the digital signature of the owner.\n\nA deal or transaction is authorized by a mathematical verification in a peer-to-peer network. This peer-to-peer network is a large group of individuals who act as authorities to reach a consensus on transactions, among other things.\n\nAll of these transactions are stored in a structure known as the digital ledger. In layman\u2019s terms, the digital ledger works like a spreadsheet containing all the numerous nodes in a network and has the history of all purchases made by each node. The information contained in the digital ledger is highly secure and the digital signature safeguards it from being tampered with. The most interesting part about this ledger is that anyone can see the data, but no one is able to corrupt it.\n\nHistory of Blockchain\n\nIn 1982, David Chaum proposed the first-ever blockchain-like protocol in his dissertation, Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups. This concept was further worked on by Stuart Haber and W Scott Stornetta in 1991, where they described the process of a cryptographically secured chain of blocks with timestamps that could not be tampered with.\n\nHowever, blockchain was first popularized by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. He improved the design using hashcash-like methods to timestamp each block without the need for a central authority or \u201ctrusted parties\u201d. These improvements were so innovative and have become the backbone of cryptocurrencies today.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nWhy Do Transactions Fail?\n\nImagine two people are making a money transaction. Now, assuming the sender has properly sent the money from his bank, there\u2019s no chance the transaction will fail, right?\n\nActually, there are several things that can go wrong, including:\n\nSomething could have gone wrong at the bank (such as a technical issue) The sender\u2019s account could have been hacked The transfer limits of the day could have been exceeded Debited from one account, never credited on the other side Issues with data\n\nHowever, none of these problems are applicable to cryptocurrencies. First, let\u2019s have a look at what cryptocurrencies are.\n\nWhat is a Cryptocurrency?\n\nA cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that can be used to verify the transfer of assets, control the addition of new units, and secure financial transactions using cryptography.\n\nOne of the cryptocurrencies\u2019 most important advantages over normal (fiat) currencies is that they are not controlled by any central authority. Without a central point of failure or a \u201cvault,\u201d the funds cannot be hacked or stolen.\n\nAs an analogy, think of the popular Microsoft Excel spreadsheet program. You can make changes to the data on your own that may differ from earlier versions of the spreadsheet that are shared with others. But if you make changes to a Google Sheets document, on the other hand, those changes also show up in every other shared copy. Similarly, the shared and distributed nature of cryptocurrencies keeps everyone on the same page.\n\nTherefore, the transparency and distributed nature of blockchain technology are what make cryptocurrencies (at least those that use the blockchain) secure.\n\nWhat Are the Types of Cryptocurrencies?\n\nThere are several cryptocurrencies available in the market right now. Some of the more popular ones are:\n\nBitcoin\n\nLitecoin\n\nEthereum\n\nZ Cash\n\nDash\n\nRipple\n\nMonero\n\nNEM\n\nStellar\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are close to 3,000 cryptocurrencies in the market\u2014a market that has become nearly saturated with options. Most experts say the vast majority of these options will eventually fail as users begin to coalesce around just a few.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nThe Bitcoin Story\n\nBitcoin was introduced in 2009 by someone or a group of people known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It aimed to solve the problem faced by fiat currencies with the help of Blockchain technology. As of 2018, there were more than 1,600 cryptocurrencies that followed the concepts of Bitcoin and Blockchain, including, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and Ripple.\n\nWhenever a sender has made a transaction, he sends Bitcoins to a receiver by submitting the transaction on a public Blockchain network of Bitcoin. The miners around the world do verifications to authenticate users. There are specific participants in the Bitcoin network who are identified as miners, and they verify the authenticity of the sender and the receiver. They also validate whether the sender has enough Bitcoins to send to the receiver and also ensure that the sanity of the underlying Blockchain network to the Bitcoin is not corrupt.\n\nOnce the miner has authenticated the transaction and verified all the parameters, the transaction is added to a block, and then that block is made part of the main Blockchain. After this is done, transactions that were associated with the block are executed. Once the transaction is complete, the block is added, and the ledgers across all the nodes are updated, thereby allowing all the participants to have the same copy of the information.\n\nFeatures of Blockchain\n\nThese are the four features of Blockchain which we are going to talk about in detail:\n\nWe have a public distributed ledger, which works using a hashing encryption.\n\nEvery block has a hash value, which is the digital signature of the block.\n\nAll the transactions are approved and verified on the Blockchain network using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm.\n\nThe Blockchain network utilizes the resources of the miners, who are there to validate the transactions for rewards.\n\nAre you interested to learn about Blockchain, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies? Check out the Blockchain Certification Training and learn them today.\n\nPublic Distributed Ledger\n\nA public distributed ledger is a collection of digital data that is shared, synchronized, and replicated around the world, across multiple sites, countries, and institutions. Now let's consider a blockchain that can be accessed by anyone in the network around the world. If someone tries to alter data in one of the blocks, everyone in the network can see the alteration, because everyone in the network has a copy of the ledger. In this way, data tampering is prevented.\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nHash Encryption\n\nBlockchain uses cryptography (see definition of \"cryptography\" above) to ensure that all the data in the blocks is kept secure from unauthorized access and is not altered. Blockchain uses SHA-256 for encryption. SHA-256 is one of the strongest hash functions available. This cryptographic hash algorithm generates an almost unique 256-bit signature for a text. Blockchain also uses digital signatures to validate users.\n\nEach user has a public and private key. The public key is used to identify the user uniquely, and the private key gives the user access to everything in the account. In the process from the sender's side, the sender's message is passed through a hash function; then, the output is passed through a signature algorithm with the user's private key, then the user's digital signature is obtained. In the transmission, the user's message, digital signature, and public key are transmitted.\n\nIn the process on the receiver's side, the message is passed through a cryptographic function to get a hash value. That hash value is compared with the hash output obtained bypassing the digital signature and public key through a verification function.\n\nAs mentioned, each block in a blockchain uses SHA-256 to encrypt and therefore secure the data. Every block has four fields:\n\nPrevious hash\u2014this field stores the hash of the previous block in the Blockchain\n\nTransaction details\u2014this field contains information regarding several transactions\n\nNonce\u2014this field contains a random value (the nonce value) whose sole purpose is to act as a variate for the hash value\n\nHash address\u2014this field contains the unique identification of the block; it is a hex value of 64 characters, both letters, and numbers, obtained by using the SHA-256 algorithm\n\nThe first three values (previous hash, transaction details, and nonce) are passed through a hashing function to produce the fourth value, the hash address of that particular block.\n\nProof of Work\n\nBitcoin uses a proof-of-work system. What is proof of work? It is a piece of data that's very hard to produce (meaning it takes a lot of time or costs a lot of money) but can be easily verified by others, and it satisfies specific requirements. With bitcoin, proof of work is a competition among miners who want to add a block to the Blockchain\u2014meaning they have to find the nonce value for the block by solving a mathematical puzzle.\n\nOnce a miner discovers a nonce value, he or she spreads the word throughout the network, and if other miners validate the claim, the miner is rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins or another form of compensation. Finding a nonce value also adds that block to the Blockchain.\n\nChoosing a nonce value is the primary objective of miners. They have to find a value that is less than the target value. If they find a value greater than the target, then their mining effort is rejected. But if they can successfully generate a hash value using the nonce that is less than the target value, then their effort is accepted. This is where the entire computational power of the miner is used\u2014to generate the hash value.\n\nFinding a nonce value requires a lot of time, money, and resources. When the nonce value is found, the miner spreads the word about finding this value, other miners attempt to validate the claim, and if it's verified, the miner gets the reward. So a miner is rewarded for being the first one to find the nonce, and that adds a block to the Blockchain.\n\nAs mentioned, as of today, the reward is 12.5 bitcoins. Every four years, the amount of bitcoin a miner can earn is reduced by half. Mining is the only way new bitcoins can be generated, and it ensures that there's a limit to how many bitcoins can exist in the market.\n\nMiners\n\nMining is the process of a miner being rewarded for finding the appropriate nonce first. Miners get paid in Bitcoins, and a successful verification is the only way the Bitcoins get added to the network. That is the concept of mining, and when a miner has completed the proof of work consensus, he is rewarded.\n\nA miner's fee is 12.5 Bitcoins for adding a block onto the Blockchain; however, the reward reduces by half every four years. When the fourth year approaches, the Bitcoin reward will go down to 6.25 Bitcoins, and miners also get the sum of all the transaction fees for a particular block.\n\nThe Walmart Problem\n\nWalmart was facing an issue where people were returning goods citing quality issues. Now, in an organization of Walmart\u2019s size and scope, it was quite a task to determine where bad products originated from within their supply chain. Their supply chain involved the following steps:\n\nTo ensure their reputation wasn\u2019t tarnished, they incorporated blockchain into their supply chain. Each event and detail within each step of the supply chain was logged. Now, in the scenario where a product was deemed bad and returned, Walmart would be able to determine where the issue with the product originated from in the supply chain.\n\nUses of Blockchain\n\nThe use of blockchain goes far beyond cryptocurrency and bitcoin. Here are some of the most common uses of blockchain in different industries:\n\nAnti-money laundering tracking system\n\nNFT marketplaces\n\nOriginal content creation\n\nReal-time IoT operating systems\n\nAdvertising insights\n\nMusic royalties tracking\n\nCross-border payments\n\nVoting mechanism\n\nSupply chain and logistics monitoring\n\nBasics to Advanced - Learn It All! Caltech PGP Full Stack Development Explore Program\n\nOther Fields That Use Blockchain\n\nThe financial services industry is an open field that uses blockchain technology extensively, but it's not the only one. Forbes mentions healthcare, crowdfunding, and ride-sharing in its article \"Eight Ways Blockchain Will Impact the World Beyond Cryptocurrency.\" Let's look at a few other fields.\n\nTravel\n\nBlockchain technology can be used for things like:\n\nTracking luggage, especially with multiple flights in one itinerary and international flights\n\nIdentifying passengers, saving time, and reducing lines and wait times\n\nMaking and accepting payments for services\n\nMusic\n\nThe rise of digital music has posed problems regarding issues like piracy and artist compensation. Blockchain can:\n\nHelp prevent piracy (illegal sharing) of music files\n\nBe used to compensate artists for purchased songs and albums\n\nCyber Security\n\nEven a giant company like Lockheed Martin is using Blockchain in its cybersecurity efforts. Blockchain can:\n\nHelp secure sensitive data, thanks to its cryptography feature\n\nEliminate the need for passwords, because users and devices can be authenticated using the public and private keys\n\nHuman Resources\n\nBlockchain technology is a natural fit for improving time-consuming and costly HR procedures. For example, it can:\n\nEliminate the need to run individual verification checks on potential employees\u2014blockchain transactions can store data regarding identity and employment history\n\nTrack payments and expenses, making things like paying taxes much easier for both employers and employees\n\nBlockchain as a Use Case in Banking\n\nBlockchain finds excellent use in banking. As of now, a user validates his identity to each bank he goes to, over and over. Is there a way we can ease the process with Blockchain? The answer is yes. We can use truffle, ethereum, ganache, and smart contracts, which are part of the Blockchain technology ecosystem, to make it work.\n\nDevelop a Bright Future in Blockchain Technology\n\nAs you can see, blockchain technology is enabling a whole new class of cryptocurrencies with unparalleled security and ease of use.

        "title": "Bitcoin token recovery is not a fork - CoinGeek",
        "content": "The Bitcoin token recovery process doesn\u2019t require a \u2018fork\u2019 of the blockchain, be it soft, hard, or sterling silver.\n\nMost of us will recall with some unease our first formal dinner, at which we were presented with what appeared to be a serious overabundance of forks. Confusion reigned until someone helpfully whispered to us that we start from the outside and move inward with each course. Relieved by this knowledge, we recovered our sense of decorum and went back to regaling our dinner companions with witty anecdotes. (Sure we did.)\n\nSimilar confusion appears to reign regarding the role\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of \u2018forks\u2019 in the process of token recovery on the Bitcoin blockchain. The recovery issue has been in the spotlight largely due to the efforts of Tulip Trading Limited (TTL) to convince a U.K. court that blockchain developers owe fiduciary and tortious duties to blockchain users who have been the victim of digital asset theft.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.K. Court of Appeal unanimously overturned a High Court decision to dismiss TTL\u2019s case against the blockchain developers, paving the way for a full trial on the issue. The judges\u2019 ruling stated that digital assets are \u201centrusted into the care of the developers,\u201d who may \u201crealistically\u201d have \u201ca duty to act to introduce code so that an owner\u2019s Bitcoin can be transferred to safety in the circumstances alleged by Tulip.\u201d\n\nTTL is owned by Dr. Craig Wright, the real-world figure behind Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous author of the 2008 Bitcoin white paper. TTL is endeavoring to recover over \u00a31 billion worth of digital assets, the private keys to which were stolen in a 2021 hack of Wright\u2019s computer.\n\nWright\u2019s original Bitcoin protocol contained an Alert Key function intended to notify Bitcoin miners to freeze tokens stolen from their rightful owner(s). But this function was permanently disabled by the developer group known as Bitcoin Core, many of whom are among those being called to task in the TTL case before the U.K. courts.\n\nWright has championed efforts to reintroduce some legal sanity to ownership of blockchain assets through the Digital Asset Recovery process. Predictably, this has earned him the usual brickbats from supporters of the BTC token that emerged from the developers\u2019 vivisection of the original Bitcoin protocol (now safely preserved in the form of Bitcoin BSV, aka BSV).\n\nLast October, the Bitcoin Association for BSV launched the Blacklist Manager software tool to permit miners to freeze digital assets on the BSV blockchain\u2014provided that a court order or equivalent documentation has been secured. Blacklist Manager is a key plank of Digital Asset Recovery, which maintains that a blockchain isn\u2019t some anarchic free-for-all space where property law doesn\u2019t apply.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that the current system\u2014in which victims of theft have to plead with exchanges or coin mixers not to allow thieves to convert stolen tokens and obfuscate the trail of digital breadcrumbs\u2014is untenable. When your hopes of recovering your property rely on dodgy exchanges like Binance\u2014a key conduit for criminal darknet marketplaces\u2014then abandon all hope, ye who transact here.\n\nFreeze, remove, reissue\n\nThe YouTuber known as Crypto Kid T.V.! recently discussed Wright\u2019s efforts with Ruadhan O, founder of Seasonal Tokens, an Ethereum/Polygon-based \u201ccyclical cryptocurrency ecosystem containing four tokens: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.\u201d The episode in question was titled \u2018Bitcoin Expert Ruadhan O On Craig Wright Going to Court With $2.5 Billion Demand.\u2019\n\nRuadhan believes the judges in the TTL case have made it plain that it is \u201cunacceptable for cryptocurrency to be beyond the law,\u201d and therefore, Wright is \u201cvery likely to succeed at getting the judges to understand how to freeze Bitcoins.\u201d But, with no disrespect intended toward Ruadhan, his \u2018Bitcoin expert\u2019 status takes a hit when he describes the process by which TTL might be reunited with its purloined assets.\n\nRuadhan references Blacklist Manager, noting that the U.K. court could order the Bitcoin Core developers to add this tool to the BTC blockchain\u2019s code. Ruadhan claims the result of this wouldn\u2019t be the movement of stolen tokens from one address to another, merely the freezing of the stolen tokens at their current address.\n\nBut Ruadhan claims that this freezing would require a \u2018soft fork\u2019 of the blockchain, which involves wrapping a rule change into a software envelope that essentially tells blockchain nodes to ignore the rule change. That would be arguably less disruptive than a \u2018hard fork,\u2019 in which disagreement over implementing software rules causes one faction to branch off into a completely separate chain with its own ruleset.\n\nBut this is a misrepresentation of (a) what TTL is proposing and (b) what is required to accomplish that proposal. No fork\u2014hard or soft\u2014is necessary. Token recovery merely freezes the stolen assets, and then they are removed and reissued at the tip of the chain, with a full audit trail, so everyone recognizes their provenance.\n\nThere have been preliminary discussions of ways to further enhance this process, including incorporating country codes into Bitcoin transactions, effectively marking them with jurisdictional tags. That could permit individual jurisdictions to determine what type of transactions can be conducted within their borders, but it would also allow more focused recovery processes based on the circumstances of the individual whose assets have been stolen.\n\nIf you (legally) build it, they will come\n\nAs Wright is forever reminding us, code isn\u2019t law; law is law. Absent that principle, digital assets will forever lurk in the financial shadows, of primary benefit to scammers, ransomware hackers, and other malefactors.\n\nWright says it\u2019s disingenuous to claim that Bitcoin was designed to be outside the law and that transactions are unrecoverable. The use case presented within the white paper focuses exclusively on small casual payments, i.e., under US$500. Just like cash, reversing transactions requires a level of proof that makes applying this to small and micro-level payments impractical. For this reason, Bitcoin is designed to be unable to be reversed at very small levels.\n\nHigher level transactions\u2014in the case of cash, those exceeding US$10,000\u2014require identity solutions and other provisioning that wasn\u2019t included in the original Bitcoin release, such as know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) standards. While the white paper stated how identity is firewalled in Bitcoin, that doesn\u2019t mean identity doesn\u2019t exist. Rather, identity is firewalled off the blockchain, in wallets and other applications outside the primary Bitcoin protocol.\n\nJohnny Jaswal is managing director and general counsel at the Toronto-based Jaswal Institute, which provides regulatory, legal, government relations, strategic, and related investment banking advisory services. Jaswal is also assisting with Token Recovery, whose mission Jaswal describes as \u201cbringing the law to digital assets to increase the retail, institutional, and enterprise adoption of blockchain structures and digital assets by fostering confidence in these powerful systems.\u201d\n\nJaswal told CoinGeek that \u201cthe suggestion that a lack of technological understanding or lost keys can lead to someone losing ownership of assets is not workable in a functioning and thriving financial system.\u201d Referencing Ruadhan\u2019s comments regarding the TTL case, Jaswal said that despite the work his group has been doing to raise awareness of the realities of digital asset recovery, \u201cmany still don\u2019t have it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most misunderstood component in the market is that, similar to the legal principles being espoused in the TTL matter, the recovery process centers on taking existing legal frameworks and applying them to blockchain technology; for example, by establishing legal ownership over an asset and implementing that ownership by mandating the enforcement of rules via the network, as stated in the Bitcoin white paper. \u2018Not your keys, not your coins\u2019 is contrary to the law and impedes the efficient operation of the market, and the work we are doing at Token Recovery is making that clear.\u201d\n\nWatch: Digital Asset Recovery on Bitcoin Explained\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Yet another victim of the \u2018crypto winter\u2019, bitcoin (BTC) miner Core Scientific, Inc., following a comprehensive review of potential alternatives and exhaustive discussions with its stakeholders, has filed for bankruptcy protection in order to implement a restructuring support agreement (RSA).\n\nCore Scientific is one of a number of crypto firms to have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent months, as well as being one of several crypto mining operations that have faltered financially.\n\nTo implement the comprehensive restructuring transaction contemplated by the RSA, the company has filed voluntary petitions for reorganisation under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nAccording to the filing, Core Scientific has approximately 1000 to 5000 creditors and its estimated assets are worth between $1bn to $10bn. The company has stated that it plans to move swiftly through the restructuring process.\n\nThe Chapter 11 filing was necessitated by a decline in the company\u2019s operating performance and liquidity suffering from the prolonged decrease in the price of bitcoin, the increase in electricity costs necessary to power the company\u2019s data centres, as well as the failure by certain of its hosting customers to honour their payment obligations.\n\nIn response to these factors, Core Scientific has actively taken steps to decrease monthly costs, delay construction expenses, reduce and delay capital expenditures and increase hosting profitability.\n\nIn a statement, the company said that during the Chapter 11 process and upon emergence, it would continue to operate its existing self-mining and hosting operations, which remain significantly cash flow positive on a debt-free basis. The company also stated that it is committed to operating normally during the implementation of its restructuring and remains dedicated to providing hosting services and self-mining in its state-of-the-art data centres.\n\nIn connection with the RSA, a debtor-in-possession (DIP) facility of up to $56m has been agreed to support the syndication of up to an additional $19m in new money DIP facility loans to all holders of convertible notes. These funds, along with ongoing cash generated from operations, are anticipated to provide the necessary financing to effectuate the planned restructuring, facilitate the emergence from Chapter 11, and cover the fees and expenses of legal and financial advisers.\n\nThe RSA is subject to a \u2018fiduciary out\u2019 for Core Scientific to pursue better alternatives. In addition, as expected, the restructuring will reduce the company\u2019s funded indebtedness by hundreds of millions of dollars and reduce annual interest expense by tens of millions of dollars.\n\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is acting as Core Scientific\u2019s legal adviser, with AlixPartners, LLP as financial adviser and PJT Partners LP as investment banker.\n\nOne of the largest publicly traded blockchain computing data centre providers and miners of digital assets in North America, Core Scientific has operated blockchain computing data centres in North America since 2017, using its facilities and intellectual property portfolio for colocated digital asset mining and self-mining.\n\nIn consultation with its advisers and a special committee of the board of directors, Core Scientific has determined that the restructuring contemplated by the RSA represents the optimal path forward and best positions the company for long-term success.\n\n\u00a9 Financier Worldwide"

        "title": "How to trade bull and bear flag patterns? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In technical analysis, a flag pattern indicates short-term price movements inside a parallelogram coounter to the previous long-term trend. Traditional analysts view flags as potential trend continuation indicators.\n\nThere are two types of flag patterns: bull flag and bear flag. While their outcomes are different, each flag exhibits five key characteristics, as listed below:\n\nThe strong preceding trend (flagpole or pole) The consolidation channel (the flag itself) The trading volume pattern A breakout A confirmation of the price moving in the direction of its previous trend.\n\nIn this article, we discuss bull and bear flag patterns and how to trade them.\n\nWhat is a bull flag pattern?\n\nA bull flag is a technical pattern that appears when the price consolidates lower inside a downward-sloping channel after a strong uptrend. The said channel comprises two parallel, rising trendlines. Kindly note that the pattern could be a wedge or a pennant if the trendlines converge.\n\nThe volume typically dries up during consolidation, implying that traders associated with the preceding trend have less urgency to buy or sell during the consolidation period.\n\nBull flag illustration\n\nThe urgency to jump in by new and old investors, or \u201cFOMO\u201d (fear of missing out), typically returns when the price breaks above the bull flag\u2019s upper trendline, thus boosting trading volumes.\n\nAs a result, analysts view strong volumes as a sign of a successful bull flag breakout.\n\nOn the other hand, lackluster volumes when the price breaks above the bull flag's upper trendline increase the possibility of a fakeout. In other words, the price risks dropping below the upper trendline, thus invalidating the bullish continuation setup.\n\nTrading a bull flag setup\n\nTraders can enter a long position at the bottom of a bull flag in anticipation that the price\u2019s next run-up toward the pattern\u2019s upper trendline will result in a breakout. The more risk-averse traders can wait for a breakout confirmation before opening a long position.\n\nAs for the upside target, a bull flag breakout typically prompts the price to rise by as much as the flagpole\u2019s size when measured from the flag\u2019s bottom.\n\nThe following Bitcoin (BTC) price pattern between December 2020 and February 2021 shows a successful bull flag breakout setup.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAs a note of caution, traders should maintain their risks by placing a stop loss just below their entry levels. That will enable them to reduce their losses if the bull flag gets invalidated.\n\nWhat is a bear flag pattern\n\nA bear flag pattern is the opposite of a bull flag pattern, exhibiting an initial downside move followed by an upward consolidation inside a parallel channel. The downside move is called the flagpole, and the upward consolidation channel is the bear flag itself.\n\nMeanwhile, the period of bear flag formation tends to coincide with declining trading volumes.\n\nBear flag illustration\n\nTrading a bear flag pattern\n\nThe following is an illustration of how to trade bear flag pattern on crypto charts.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart featuring a bear flag breakdown. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the Bitcoin chart above, the price has formed a flagpole followed by an upward retracement inside a rising parallel channel. Eventually, BTC price breaks out of the channel range to the downside and drops by as much as the flagpole\u2019s height.\n\nTraders can choose to open a short position on a pullback from the flag\u2019s upper trendline or wait until the price breaks below the lower trendline with rising volumes.\n\nIn either case, the short target is, as a rule, measured by subtracting the flag\u2019s peak from the flagpole size.\n\nRelated: What is a Doji candle pattern and how to trade with it?\n\nMeanwhile, a breakdown below the flag\u2019s lower trendline accompanying lackluster volumes suggests a fakeout, meaning the price may reclaim the lower trendline as support for a potential rebound inside the parallel channel.\n\nTo limit losses in a fakeout scenario, it is important to place a stop loss just above the entry levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

        "content": "Can I buy a house in Portugal with Bitcoin? The answer is yes, and although not very significant in number, in Portugal there are already several cases of buying and selling properties in cryptocurrencies. When it comes to real estate and bitcoin in Portugal, most sales take place south of the Tagus, namely in Lisbon and the Algarve, according to data revealed by the Order of Notaries in Portugal.\n\nLast year, according to Expresso, notaries made 13 deeds of purchase and sale of property whose payment was made in the form of digital assets. Bitcoin or ethereum were the two cryptocurrencies used as means of payment in real estate transactions, the publication also indicates.\n\nBut seven deeds were also refused, for various reasons: lack of compliance in the requirements regarding the prevention of money laundering; lack of technological knowledge to carry out the transaction; or doubts about tax rules to be applied.\n\n\"The numbers reflect that there are people willing to conduct business with cryptocurrencies in Portugal, but that there is also a lot of work to be done to have a clearer and more global legislative framework,\" Jorge Batista da Silva, head of the Order of Notaries, tells the Portuguese newspaper Expresso."

Nigeria, is the only African country to make it to the top five of the ranking according to the study.\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency betting experts cryptobetting.org combined Google Trends searches across the globe for countries searching for Bitcoin, alongside the number of Bitcoin ATMs in each country per 100,000 people and data on Crypto ownership per country. These metrics were then combined into an index to allocate each country a rating out of 100 to reveal which countries are most interested in Bitcoin.\n\nadvertisement\n\n1. United States \u2013 54.95/100.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe United States ranks as the most Bitcoin-obsessed country in the world, with a total score of 54.95. The country boasts a high number of Bitcoin ATMs, clearly indicating the growing interest in the cryptocurrency. In the United States, around 13.22% of the population owns cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin being the most popular choice among these individuals. The large number of Bitcoin ATMs, along with the high rate of ownership, places the United States among the top countries in terms of Bitcoin popularity globally. The interest and adoption of Bitcoin in the United States is a testament to the growing acceptance of digital currencies as a legitimate form of investment and financial instrument.\n\n2. El Salvador \u2013 46.19/100\n\nadvertisement\n\nEl Salvador is a unique and prominent player in the world of Bitcoin, with a total score of 46.19. The country ranks second globally on the scale of countries with the highest interest in Bitcoin, making it a standout destination for digital currency enthusiasts. What sets El Salvador apart is that it is one of only two countries in the world where Bitcoin is considered legal tender. This distinction could explain the high level of interest in the country, as evidenced by the highest global Google searches for Bitcoin originating from El Salvador. The country is also the leader in Bitcoin popularity in Latin America, with 212 Bitcoin ATMs available for use. The combination of being a legal tender and the large number of ATMs makes El Salvador a hub for Bitcoin activity and a prime example of the growing acceptance of digital currencies.\n\n3. Vietnam \u2013 35.69/100\n\nVietnam has positioned itself as a leader in terms of interest and adoption of Bitcoin, with a score of 35.69. Vietnam has the highest percentage of cryptocurrency ownership globally at 26%, while it also has 8 Bitcoin ATMs, making it easier for individuals to access and use the cryptocurrency. Vietnam\u2019s strong interest in Bitcoin has made it the most popular country for digital currency in Asia. This high level of ownership and accessibility highlights Bitcoin as a legitimate form of investment in Vietnam and the wider Asia region.\n\n4. Canada \u2013 35.49/100\n\nCanada has a strong and growing interest in Bitcoin, with a score of 35.49 therefore placing fourth on the list. Canada has a large number of Bitcoin ATMs, with 2,645 ATMs available for use, and has the second highest number of Bitcoin ATMs per 100,000 people. In Canada, 4.1% of the population owns cryptocurrency, with the majority being Bitcoin. This high number of ATMs and the growing ownership of Bitcoin contribute towards a total score of 35.49 out of 100.\n\n5. Nigeria \u2013 25.31/100\n\nNigeria is a leading player in the world of Bitcoin, with a score of 25.31, helping it rank as the fifth country most interested in Bitcoin. The country is the leader in Bitcoin popularity in Africa, and also ranks second globally for Google Trends searches for Bitcoin, further emphasizing the high level of interest and recognition of the digital currency in the country.\n\nWhere do the other countries place on the list?\n\nSwitzerland places sixth on the list and is the European country with the highest interest in Bitcoin with a score of 19.14 out of a 100, rounding out the top ten is the Philippines with 18.71, India with 17.08, Venezuela with 16.88 and lastly Austria with 16.31. The United Kingdom places 20th on the list with a score of 12.19.\n\nCommenting on the findings, a spokesperson for cryptobetting.org said: \u201cBitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency across the world and this study highlights its immense popularity, with countries from different continents placing on the list, emphasizing Bitcoin\u2019s global interest.\n\n\u201cWhile it was expected that the United States would place first in the study, it is interesting to see that El Salvador places second. This can be explained by the fact that El Salvador became the first country in the world to use Bitcoin as a legal tender.\u201d"

        "content": "As Bitcoin (BTC) attempts to put behind the effects of last year\u2019s bear market, the maiden crypto is recording a positive shift in its onchain activities.\n\nIn particular, as of February 21, Bitcoin\u2019s current demand for inscription transactions which stands at 1.14, has pushed the asset\u2019s transaction count momentum to hit the highest level since January 2021, data by crypto analysis platform Glassnode indicates.\n\n\u201cThe rapid ascent in Transaction Count reflects a significant increase in the network activity, as demand for on-chain transactions begins to return,\u201d Glassnode said.\n\nBitcoin transaction count momentum. Source: Glassnode\n\nImplications of Bitcoin\u2019s transaction momentum\n\nNotably, this is a significant development for Bitcoin, which has struggled to maintain a consistent level of on-chain activity in recent months as the general market downturn impacted the asset. In this line, the metric highlights the overall health of the Bitcoin network while offering a glimpse of what to expect, especially on the price movement front.\n\nIt is worth noting that the last time the transaction count surged, Bitcoin was building the foundation for a bull run that culminated in an all-time high of almost $69,000 in late 2021.\n\nIndeed, the renewed onchain activity corresponds with a period Bitcoin has recorded increased attention on various features. As reported by Finbold, the Taproot feature hit the highest adoption level at 13% on February 16.\n\nThe transaction craze can also be attributed to the Ordinal inscription on the network. In this case, Ordinals are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be permanently stored inside the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $24,709 with daily gains of slightly above 1%. Overall, BTC is attempting to reclaim the $25,000 position that has been touted to trigger a sustained rally toward $30,000.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe latest price movement comes as Bitcoin technical indicators point to a possible bullish momentum in the coming days. As per a Finbold report, historical data indicates that BTC is likely forming the base for a bull run for the next three years.\n\nLastly, the machine learning algorithm at PricePredications indicates that Bitcoin is likely to trade at $24,934 on March 1, 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
