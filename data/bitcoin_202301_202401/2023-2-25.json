        "title": "\"Impulsive psychopaths\" are drawn to Bitcoin and other crypto - Big Think",
        "content": "Since the invention of Bitcoin in 2009 the global cryptocurrency market has grown from nothing to a value of around US$2 trillion. From a price of US$1 in 2011, Bitcoin rose to an all-time high of more than US$63,000 in April 2021, and now hovers around the US$42,000 mark.\n\nLarge fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices are common, which makes them a highly speculative investment. What kind of people are willing to take the risk, and what motivates them?\n\nWe conducted a survey to find out. In particular, we wanted to know about the relationship between the so-called \u201cdark tetrad\u201d personality traits and attitudes towards cryptocurrency.\n\nThe dark tetrad\n\nIn psychology, the \u201cdark tetrad\u201d refers to a group of four personality traits. These are Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy (together known as the \u201cdark triad\u201d), plus sadism.\n\nThey are called \u201cdark\u201d because of their \u201cevil\u201d qualities: extreme selfishness and taking advantage of others without empathy. The dark tetrad are also often related to risk-taking behaviours.\n\nThe appeal of cryptocurrency\n\nWe identified two main areas of appeal. First, the high risks and high potential returns of crypto trading make it attractive to the kind of people who like gambling.\n\nSecond, cryptocurrencies are not issued or backed by governments like traditional or \u201cfiat\u201d currencies. This makes them attractive to people who distrust government.\n\nWhat are the personalities of crypto buyers?\n\nWe asked 566 people to complete online personality surveys as well as answer questions about their attitudes to crypto and whether or not they planned to invest in it. Of our participants, 26% reported they own crypto and 64% showed interest in crypto investing.\n\nWe measured their dark tetrad traits using standard psychological tests. We also measured traits that might connect the dark tetrad to judgements about crypto: fear of missing out(FOMO; the feeling that others are experiencing better things than you are), positivity (the tendency to be positive or optimistic in life), and belief in conspiracy theories.\n\nWhy do people want to buy crypto? It\u2019s not just about making money\n\nA common reason to invest in crypto is the hope of earning high returns. Beyond the desire to build wealth, our research shows dark personality traits also drive crypto buying.\n\nMachiavellianism is named after the Italian political philosophy of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. People who rate highly on this trait are good at deception and interpersonal manipulation.\n\nMachiavellians take a calculated approach to achieving goals, and avoid impulsive decisions. They are less likely to engage in problem gambling.\n\nMachiavellians also tend to believe strongly in government conspiracies. For example, they often believe politicians usually do not reveal their true motives, and that government agencies closely monitor all citizens.\n\nWe found Machiavellians like crypto primarily because they distrust politicians and government agencies. Many crypto supporters believe governments are corrupt, and crypto avoids government corruption.\n\nOverconfidence and positivity\n\nNarcissism is a self-centred personality trait, characterised by feelings of privilege and predominance over others. Narcissists are overconfident and are more willing to do things like make risky investments in the stock market and gamble.\n\nNarcissists tend to focus on the positive side of life. We found narcissists like crypto because of their great faith in the future, and because of their confidence their own lives will improve.\n\nImpulsive psychopaths like crypto\n\nPsychopathy is a callous, impulsive antisocial personality trait. Psychopathic people often find it difficult to perceive, understand, or address emotions due to a lack of emotional intelligence and empathy.\n\nThe reckless nature of psychopaths makes them more resistant to stress and anxiety. As a result, psychopaths like stimulation-seeking and risk-taking. They are prone to gambling and gambling addiction.\n\nWe found that impulsive psychopaths like crypto, because they fear missing out on investing rewards that others are experiencing.\n\nHow is sadism involved?\n\nEveryday sadism relates to a personality enjoying another\u2019s suffering. Sadists often display aggression and cruel behaviours. For example, sadists troll others on the Internet for enjoyment.\n\nSubscribe for counterintuitive, surprising, and impactful stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.\n\nAt first glance, buying crypto is unlikely to harm others. However, we found sadists like crypto because they do not want to miss out on investment rewards either. To them, perhaps both the pleasure from seeing another\u2019s pain and the fear of missing out are related to selfishness.\n\nUnlike narcissists, we found both psychopaths and sadists lack positivity about their prospects, which cancels out their liking of crypto.\n\nDark tetrad personality traits influence positivity, conspiracy beliefs, and fear of missing out, which in turn influence attitudes to cryptocurrency. (Wes Mountain/The Conversation, CC BY-ND)\n\nA psychological lens\n\nStudying cryptocurrency through the psychological lens of the dark tetrad offers insight into why people want to buy crypto. We are not suggesting that everyone interested in crypto displays dark tetrad traits.\n\nWe studied only a subset of people interested in crypto who do have these traits. If you happen to be a Bitcoin or other crypto holder, you may or may not exhibit them.\n\nIf you want to know how you score for dark tetrad traits, you can do the Dark Triad Personality Test and Sadism Test online.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "title": "THETA, LIDO, KLAY and EGLD flash bullish signs as Bitcoin recaptures $23K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency markets and the United States equities markets witnessed profit-booking this week as the macroeconomic data hinted toward continued rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin (BTC) is down more than 4% and the S&P 500 fell 2.7% to record its worst week of the year.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool shows a 73% probability of a 25 basis points rate hike by the Fed in the March meeting but after the hotter-than-expected inflation readings in two weeks, the probability of a 50 basis point rate hike has started to slowly gain traction.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nDuring periods of uncertainty, some coins enter a deeper correction while a few buck the trend and continue to outperform. Hence, it becomes important to select the right coins to trade.\n\nA few coins that have witnessed a shallow correction or have bounced sharply off the support have been selected in this list. Let\u2019s see their charts and determine the levels to watch out for.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin plunged below the 20-day exponential moving average ($23,391) on Feb. 24 but the bears could not build upon this advantage and sustain the price below the strong support at $22,800.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price bounced off $22,800 on Feb. 25 and the bulls are trying to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, it will indicate that the BTC/USDT pair may consolidate between $25,250 and $22,800 for a few days.\n\nThe flattening 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint also suggest a range-bound action in the near term.\n\nAlternatively, if the price slips below $22,700, the selling could intensify and the pair may plummet to the next strong support at $21,480.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA has turned down on the four-hour chart and the RSI is in the negative territory. This indicates an advantage to the bears. Sellers will try to protect the 20-EMA, and if the price turns down from this level, the likelihood of a break below $22,800 increases. If that happens, the selling may intensify and the pair may slide to $21,480.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price breaks above the 20-EMA, it will suggest that bulls are buying on dips. That could push the pair to the 50-simple moving average and keep the price stuck inside the range for some more time.\n\nLDO/USDT\n\nLido DAO (LDO) did not sustain below the 20-day EMA ($2.75) during the recent correction, which is a positive sign. Another bullish sign is the formation of the pennant near the local highs.\n\nLDO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to propel the price above the resistance line of the pennant. If they succeed, the LDO/USDT pair could start the next leg of the up-move. The pair may first rise to $3.90 and thereafter attempt a rally to $4.24.\n\nConversely, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. That could keep the price inside the pennant for a while longer. The bears will have to sink the price below the pennant if they want to signal a short-term trend reversal.\n\nLDO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe strong bounce off the support line of the pennant indicates aggressive buying on dips. Buyers will have to overcome the obstacle at the resistance line to regain control. If they do that, the pair may resume its uptrend.\n\nHowever, the bears are likely to have other plans as they will try to protect the resistance line. If the price turns down from this level, the state of equilibrium may continue for some more time.\n\nA break below the pennant could attract profit-booking by short-term traders. That may tug the price to $2.20 and later to $2.\n\nEGLD/USDT\n\nMultiversX (EGLD) turned down from the resistance line but an encouraging sign is that the bulls are trying to defend the 20-day EMA ($47).\n\nEGLD/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 54, indicating that buyers have a slight edge. The bulls will try to push the price toward the resistance line where they are again likely to face strong opposition from the bears.\n\nThis bullish view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA. That will indicate selling by the bears on every minor rally. The EGLD/USDT pair could then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($44) and later to $40.\n\nEGLD/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is falling inside a descending channel pattern. Buyers purchased at lower levels and have pushed the price to the resistance line of the channel. If this resistance gives way, the pair could rise to the 50-SMA and thereafter attempt a retest of the strong barrier at $54.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the bears have not given up. That could result in a drop toward the support line of the channel.\n\nRelated: How does the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) impact cryptocurrencies? Watch Macro Markets\n\nTHETA/USDT\n\nThe bulls are trying to arrest Theta Network\u2019s (THETA) pullback at the 20-day EMA ($1.15). Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating advantage to the bulls.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf buyers thrust the price above the downtrend line, the THETA/USDT pair could climb to the overhead resistance at $1.34. This is a formidable resistance and a break above it could open the gates for a possible surge to $1.70.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down and plunges below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term bulls may be rushing to the exit. That may start a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($1.05) and then to the psychological support at $1.\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is oscillating near the center, indicating a balance between supply and demand.\n\nA break below the triangle could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears. The pair could first fall to $1.12 and then to $1.\n\nIf bulls want to prevent the decline, they will have to quickly propel the price above the triangle. That could start a journey to $1.27 and later to $1.30.\n\nKLAY/USDT\n\nKlaytn (KLAY) is attempting to break out from a basing pattern. The price rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($0.26) on Feb. 25, indicating solid buying on dips.\n\nKLAY/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to pierce the overhead resistance at $0.34. If they do that, the KLAY/USDT pair could pick up momentum and soar to the psychological resistance at $0.50. Such a move will signal a potential trend change.\n\nIf the price turns down from $0.34, it will indicate that bears are fiercely protecting the level. That could again pull the price down to the 20-day EMA. A break below this level could indicate that the pair may spend some more time in the basing pattern.\n\nKLAY/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls arrested the pullback near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of $0.26 and started a recovery. There is a minor resistance at $0.32 but if this level is crossed, the pair could attempt a rally to $0.34 and thereafter to $0.37.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. That may enhance the prospects of a break below $0.26. If that happens, the pair may slide to $0.22.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether rose on Monday morning in Asia along with all of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, though most are still trading lower from prices a week ago. Solana led the gainers, bouncing back from a network glitch. The gains in crypto came despite the declines in equities on Wall Street on Friday following release of data showing inflation remains stubbornly high.\n\nSee related article: IMF releases crypto action plan, advises against legal tender status\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 1.70% in the past 24 hours to trade at US$23,559 as of 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, but is still down 3.15% for the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum gained 2.87% to US$1,640, reducing its loss for the week to 2.5%.\n\nSolana bounced back 3.3% to US$23.25 after resolving a technical glitch on Saturday that had slowed transactions on the Solana blockchain, according to Solana monitoring site Solana Status. The token is still down 6.5% for the seven day period.\n\nShiba Inu gained 3.6% after developers announced over the weekend a beta version of Shibarium, which is expected to reduce transaction fees and improve the scalability of the Shiba Inu blockchain. However, like other crypto, the meme token is down for the week, posting a weekly loss of 4.0%.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged 1.9% higher to US$1.08 trillion, while the total trading volume fell by 8.2% over the past 24 hours to US$34.35 billion.\n\nU.S. equities closed lower on Friday to post the worst week so far in 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.02%, the S&P 500 dropped 1.05% and the Nasdaq Composite Index posted the biggest loss of 1.69%.\n\nThe losses in equities followed the release of the personal consumption expenditures price index for January, which rose 4.7% on year and 0.6% on month when excluding food and energy prices. The index is used by the Federal Reserve to track inflation, suggesting the central bank may be more likely to keep interest rates higher for longer to slow the pace of inflation.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. The January Fed meeting minutes released last Wednesday showed policymakers agreed to moderate the size of rate increases, but warned the tightening cycle is not over.\n\nAnalysts at the CME Group expect a 72.3% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points next month. They also predict a 27.7% chance of 50 basis point hike, which has increased from 18.1% last week. The next Fed meeting to decide on interest rates will be held on March 21 and 22.\n\nSee related article: Taiwan must mandate a central authority to oversee crypto by May 16, says lawmaker"

        "title": "An Introduction to Bitcoin Ordinals - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Ordinals. Inscriptions. If you\u2019re a crypto newbie, these terms may seem foreign to you. If you\u2019ve been in crypto for long, it is also unlikely you know these terms. Yet, Ordinals have been all the rage this past month. So, what exactly are these? Today, we provide an introduction to Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nTo do so, we\u2019ll be summarizing an interview by Stephan Livera as shown below. Said interview is with Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals.\n\nWho Is Casey Rodarmor?\n\nThe interview starts off with Casey summarizing his own background. In short, he is a long-time Bitcoiner and software engineer. In his early days, he worked for big tech companies like Google and Meta. After discovering crypto, his accomplishments include:\n\nHelping Chaincode Labs as a Bitcoin core developer.\n\nCreating Agora. Agora allows users to sell files for $BTC lightning payments.\n\nHosting the San Francisco Bitcoin Developer\u2019s meetup.\n\nTo date, his biggest achievement would be the creation of Ordinals. He began working on it since early 2022. Moving forward to August 2022, he created ORD. ORD comprises a wallet and block explorer, which you can access here. On 21 January 2023, Ordinals launches and immediately gains a large user base.\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nNext, Casey moves on to explain what Ordinals and Inscriptions are. In a nutshell, this is a dual-layer project. Ordinals make up the base layer, and Inscriptions make up the top layer. With this, users can create and store digital NFTs directly on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\n1) Ordinals\n\nOrdinals is arbitrary data stored in one satoshi (sat) on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. A sat is a small fraction of a Bitcoin. To recap, 1 $BTC equals to 100,000,000 sats. Moreover, users can send/receive ordinals.\n\nAs Casey explains in his exact words, \u201cOrdinals are a convention which anyone can opt into\u201d. He states that it is \u201cjust a convention that does not exist on the Bitcoin layer\u201d. With it, \u201cyou can do things like see a sat\u2019s particular history, make sats rare and exotic, give sats names and other wacky stuff.\u201d Again, he reiterates that \u201cit\u2019s just this thing that you can convention that you can view the blockchain and pretend that individual sats have an identity and individual sats can move from UTXO to UTXO.\u201d\n\nSo, how do we modify sats? This brings us to the next layer \u2013 Inscriptions.\n\nInscriptions\n\nInscriptions refer to the addition of data to each Sat, to make it an Ordinal. Said data can be in various forms, such as:\n\nText.\n\nAudio.\n\nVideo.\n\nAudio.\n\nIn Casey\u2019s own words, inscriptions are \u201canother convention which allows you to stick content (any file returnable by a file server, or any content viewable by a browser). Content is assigned to one of the SATs in the output of the transaction.\u201d. With this, \u201cthis turns the sats effectively into a \u201cDigital Artifact\u201d.\n\nNow, you can see that each Sat has the potential to exist as an NFT. Or a Digital Artifact, as Casey puts it. Each Ordinal is also immutable and secure. This is similar in nature to Ethereum\u2019s NFTs.\n\nPros and Cons of Ordinals\n\nMoving on, Stephan and Casey went on to discuss the pros and cons of Ordinals. Starting with the bull case, Casey states the benefits of Ordinals:\n\nRepresenting art, culture and money. Casey explains that old forms of money were intertwined with art and culture. In the olden days, money was in the forms of carved beads and art. Ordinal inscriptions are its modern representation.\n\nCasey explains that old forms of money were intertwined with art and culture. In the olden days, money was in the forms of carved beads and art. Ordinal inscriptions are its modern representation. Filling market demand. Casey brings up the immense popularity of NFTs. He believes that Ordinals provide the right product-market fit.\n\nCasey brings up the immense popularity of NFTs. He believes that Ordinals provide the right product-market fit. Onboarding users to the Bitcoin network. Casey opines that Ordinals can attract more users to use Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a flip side as well. During the interview, Stephan brings up a few cons for Ordinals.\n\nFirstly, he says that Ordinals could make validating harder. Bitcoin nodes have to download more data in order to validate the blockchain. Casey acknowledges this concern. Secondly, Stephan brings up a concern if Ordinals gaining traction. More users on the Bitcoin network would equate to higher fees. Again, this is a valid point.\n\nThe Potential of Ordinals\n\nDespite the cons above, Casey provides a simple reply. NFTs are meant to be fun! Every person views NFTs differently. Some value it while others think that it\u2019s garbage. Truth of the matter is: There is a thriving market for it. So, the Bitcoin network should improve to cater to increased volume instead. It makes no sense to stifle innovation just to keep Bitcoin fees low.\n\nThe discussion then segues into the consumption of blockspace. Now, what does this mean? Let\u2019s find out more.\n\nConsumption of Blockspace\n\nCasey makes it clear that Ordinals are more secure compared to Ethereum\u2019s NFTs. This is because Ordinals exist fully on-chain. Remember what we went through earlier? Data is inscribed directly onto a Sat. With that, an Ordinal is as secure as a Bitcoin.\n\nThis is in contrast to Ethereum\u2019s NFTs. On Ethereum, NFT metadata could be stored off-chain. It could be stored on third party systems. For instance, an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or external servers. If such third parties go offline, you could lose access to your NFT.\n\nBitcoin is the most badass, resilient, immutable database on planet earth. Ordinal inscriptions are how you write files to that database. Stop asking \"why ordinals?\" if your pfp is stored in the AWS data center in Columbus, Ohio. \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) February 23, 2023\n\nWith Ethereum, NFTs also face smart contract risks. Your NFT could be lost if its smart contract is buggy or malicious. Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions address both of these risks Ethereum NFTs face. Hence, an increase in blockspace consumption here does have its own benefits too!\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, the interview was very informative. The discussion skews toward the technical side at times. Even so, it provides a great overview of Casey\u2019s project.\n\nWhat I do agree with Casey on is: Bitcoin Ordinals are here to stay. Whether you like it or not. Indeed, it\u2019s a new use-case for Bitcoin. We should embrace such new innovations, rather than fight it.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "title": "Bitcoin: Assessing whether or not a local bottom has been reached - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "CryptoQuant analyst Wedson has opined that a local top has been reached.\n\nOn-chain metrics, however, paint a different picture.\n\nCryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson has suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] price, which saw a 6% decline in the last week, may have hit a local bottom at the $24,000 price mark.\n\nWedson concluded after assessing the 350-day moving average and the 100-day exponential moving average that makes up BTC\u2019s Taker Buy Sell Ratio indicator.\n\nAccording to Wedson, with the Taker Buy Sell Ratio indicator, analysts have found that the 350-day MA and 100-day EMA can identify BTC\u2019s price trend changes.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nHe noted further that the 100-day EMA crossing a value line of one could also signal local tops and bottoms, presenting buying or selling opportunities.\n\nIn the current BTC cycle, the rally in BTC\u2019s price since the year began pushed the 100-day EMA above one.\n\nThis, according to Wedson, might have ushered in a bear cycle that might result in a downward trend in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nOn-chain price bottom markers say otherwise\n\nIn terms of identifying local price bottoms for cryptocurrency assets, some on-chain metrics have been effective in that regard. One of the most effective indicators is Age Consumed, which monitors the behavior of previously inactive coins on the blockchain.\n\nA surge in Age Consumed indicates a significant number of inactive tokens have been transferred to new addresses, indicating a sudden and pronounced change in the behavior of long-term holders.\n\nSince long-term holders and experienced traders seldom make impulsive decisions, a renewed activity of dormant coins often corresponds with significant changes in market conditions.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nA look at BTC\u2019s age consumed revealed a spike in its Age Consumed metric on 22 February, when the king coin traded at $23,700. BTC\u2019s price spent the next three days rallying to trade at $24,100, at press time.\n\nThe growth in BTC\u2019s price, which followed the surge in Age Consumed, could be taken to mean that the leading coin bottomed at the $23,700 price point, and further rallies should be anticipated.\n\nAnother indicator that might be useful in this regard is BTC\u2019s Network Profit/Loss ratio (NPL). This metric calculates the mean profit or loss of all coins that are transferred to new addresses on a daily basis.\n\nThis approach is used to identify instances of profit-taking or holder capitulation on the blockchain.\n\nDips in the NPL metric frequently indicate brief periods of capitulation by \u201cweak hands\u201d and the return of \u201csmart money\u201d to the market. This is why these dips often occur concurrently with local rebounds and phases of price recovery.\n\nThis has been the case with BTC in the past few days. Data from Santiment revealed a significant dip in the king coin\u2019s NPL on 22 February, which has since been followed by a surge in its price."

        "title": "Big Eyes Coin Could Make You A Millionaire, Just Like Bitcoin And Ethereum Did Some Years Ago - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "If you had invested in Bitcoin (BTC) when it launched in 2009, your returns could be in the millions or billions even though your initial capital was $0 because that was the cost of the coin at the time. If you got in a bit later, like when it was 10 cents in late 2010, and invested only $10, you would have been able to buy about 100 bitcoins.\n\nEven at its current low, those 100 bitcoins would be worth more than $2.4 million. Imagine if you had bought more back then.\n\nWe can do a similar calculation with Ethereum (ETH). When it launched in 2015, it first traded at $2.77 but quickly fell in value to $0.81 within 24 hours. Let\u2019s play the \u201cimagine\u201d game again.\n\nSo, if you had spent a mere $100 on day one, you\u2019d have about 36 ETH tokens, or if you bought on day two, you\u2019d have about 123 tokens. At this moment, ETH is valued at $1664.8 per token. Do the math.\n\nWhile the possibility of repeating the success of Bitcoin millionaires is slim, it is not impossible if investors get in early with their investments. Hence, Big Eyes Coin is attracting a lot of interest from smart investors who see the potential for another millionaire-making move.\n\nBig Eyes is already worth over 390%\n\nWe have seen time and again that the earlier investors buy into a cryptocurrency, the greater the profit. For most coins, there is no earlier entry point than their presale journey.\n\nRight now, Big Eyes is making huge waves as a result of how successful its presale has been, which is an indicator of how well the coin can potentially perform when it is launched to the public.\n\nFor a cat-themed meme, BIG has managed to raise $30 million in its 12th stage of the presale and can be bought for a tiny amount of $0.00049. That is still a 390 percent increase from its price of $0.0001 at the first stage. This means that those who bought it at stage 1 will profit by more than 390% of those who buy at stage 12.\n\nThere is still time to take advantage of the opportunity that BIG presents, and getting in now will still be a huge advantage for investors seeing that the presale is typically the lowest amount any coin would be bought for.\n\nBitcoin \u2013 From Zero to thousands\n\nSince its launch in January 2009, the price of bitcoin has been on a roller coaster, but the long-term trajectory has been \u201cup and to the right,\u201d as they say. The advent of Bitcoin marked the beginning of the cryptocurrency era, but it took some time before the general public became aware of it.\n\nNonetheless, it appears that cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, has emerged as the most intriguing trading opportunity in more than a decade.\n\nThe coin\u2019s value has risen from $0 to $0.40, then to $1 after a few months, and then in 2011, it went to $8 before reaching $30 in the same year. At the time, this was exciting for investors, but even the most optimistic investor had no clue just how big things were going to get. Through a few ups and downs, in April 2013, the coin surpassed $100, and barely eight days later, it was trading at $230.\n\nOver the next few years, BTC flirted with different figures, and by December 2020, BTC was closing the year at $28,949. 2021 was probably the most successful year for Bitcoin investors as the coin rose to an all-time high of $68,789 before the great crash that saw the coin lose value and end at its current price.\n\nEthereum \u2013 another crypto fairytale\n\nAfter Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. It was introduced in July 2015 and went on sale for $2.77 on August 7. The coin was worth $0.81 the following day. The price stayed below $1 until January 2016.\n\nRemember that the past few years have seen a tremendous increase in the price of digital currencies. In 2021, between January and April, the price of Ethereum increased by about 300%, and the coin surpassed $3000. Yet, even without that jump, you would still be doing well if you had purchased Ethereum at $2.77.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain the largest digital assets based on market capitalization and are known to dictate the trajectory of the entire market. However, the distribution of these cryptocurrencies is vastly different, with Ethereum having a significantly higher percentage of its supply held by whales compared to Bitcoin.\n\nIn particular, as of February 26, 2023, around 39% of the total supply of Ethereum is concentrated among large addresses, data by crypto market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock\n\nEthereum concentration by large holders. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nThis is in stark contrast to Bitcoin, where large addresses hold only 11% of the total supply.\n\nBitcoin concentration by large holders. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nIndeed, contraction by holders metric aggregates the share of circulating supply held by whale addresses, accounting for over 1% of the supply and investors or addresses holding between 0.1%-1%. The combination of the two metrics equates to the total concentration by large holders.\n\nEthereum\u2019s onchain activity\n\nEthereum\u2019s large address concentration coincides with the network\u2019s increased development activity. The staking feature remains the main highlight for the decentralized finance ecosystem following the historical Merge upgrade.\n\nAfter months of testing, investors are set to start withdrawing their staked ETH in March after the Shanghai upgrade goes live.\n\nAlthough the high concentration of Ethereum whales has different implications, it could hint at the investors\u2019 future price outlook for the asset. It is worth noting that as Ethereum undergoes significant developments, proponents still bet the asset might flip Bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, it can be argued that Ethereum is relatively cheap compared to Bitcoin, making it affordable to amass in large amounts.\n\nImplication of whale addresses\n\nThe concentration of crypto wealth in the hands of a few large holders is a controversial topic in digital asset circles. Some argue that it is a natural outcome of the market and that wealthy individuals should be allowed to hold large amounts of digital assets.\n\nOthers, however, argue that this concentration of wealth goes against the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency and could lead to market manipulation.\n\nRegardless of varied opinions on the matter, the fact remains that Ethereum\u2019s supply is significantly more concentrated in the hands of a few large holders compared to Bitcoin. This could have important implications for the future of the Ethereum ecosystem and its price.\n\nBy press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,645 with daily gains of over 4%, while Bitcoin is trading at $23,657.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
