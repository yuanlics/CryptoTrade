        "content": "A sign is seen in a stand during the Bitcoin Conference 2023, in Miami Beach, Florida, U.S., May 19, 2023.\n\nThis report is from today's CNBC Daily Open, our new, international markets newsletter. CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here .\n\nDip in markets\n\nU.S. markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was flat, but major bourses dipped slightly and ended the day in the red. Germany's DAX lost 0.1% as new data showed the country's July exports dropping 0.9% on the month and 1% year on year, adding to fears about the German economy contracting in the third quarter.\n\n'Sick man of Europe'\n\nGermany is once again the \"sick man of Europe,\" said Hans-Werner Sinn, president emeritus at the Ifo institute. The country's business activity in August contracted sharply, according to the HCOB flash purchasing managers index. Moreover, Germany's plans to be carbon neutral by 2045 poses a risk to its industry, which might cause a \"backlash\" from the population, Sinn said.\n\nMissing Xi at G20\n\nPremier Li Qiang will lead China's delegation at the G20 summit in New Delhi this weekend, said China's foreign ministry. While the ministry declined to confirm if President Xi Jinping would attend the summit, spokesperson Mao Ning didn't correct reporters who asked if Li's attendance meant Xi would not show up. Another noteworthy absence: Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNegotiating new grain deal\n\nPutin met his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, Russia on Monday. Putin reportedly said Russia is ready to renew the Black Sea Grain Initiative which allowed Ukraine to export agricultural products \u2014 but only if concessions are made to Russia as well.\n\n[PRO] Don't sleep on these stocks\n\nAdults need seven to nine hours of sleep per day. Even though 63% of U.S. adults don't meet that requirement, they are growing increasingly concerned about their wellbeing, according to a 2022 McKinsey survey. That's the start of a good dream for these sleep-related stocks."

        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia but remained below the US$26,000 resistance level, giving up much of last week\u2019s gains from a favorable court ruling on Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund application. Ether also stayed range-bound at around US$1,650, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with XRP leading the winners and Dogecoin the losers. U.S. stock futures edged down Monday morning after Wall Street closed the week higher on a cool-off in the U.S. labor market that soothed the concerns for more interest rate hikes.\n\nBitcoin gave up gains from Grayscale\u2019s victory\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.30% in the last 24 hours to US$25,958.25 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong and traded 0.46% lower for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency lost control of the US$26,000 support level on Friday and fluctuated around the mark over the weekend.\n\nBitcoin briefly reached a weekly high of over US$28,000 last Tuesday on a court ruling that required the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to review asset manager Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application, but soon gave up all the gains after the SEC delayed all pending ETF applications on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhile investors might be looking at the Grayscale v. SEC developments, it feels like the recent price action is linked to activity from the FTX wallets, igniting fear of a potential dump as some (or all) of these assets would be liquidated into fiat for expenses, repaying investors,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nA Solana-based cold wallet owned by collapsed crypto exchange FTX transferred over US$10 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including LINK, SUSHI, LUNA and YFI, to Ethereum addresses from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2, according to Arkham Intelligence data cited by blockchain journalist Colin Wu.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s prices are below their 50-day moving averages of US$28,299 and US$1,789, indicating bearishness in the prices, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in a Monday report by Matrixport.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the past month, the world\u2019s leading stablecoin USDT has lost US$1 billion in market cap and consistently traded below the 1:1 peg with U.S. dollars, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cThe decline in (USDT) market cap was first associated with a move into Bitcoin on August 8 when US$400 million was moved from USDT into BTC. But then another US$500 million appeared to have been redeemed when Bitcoin prices crashed around August 18. Liquidity leaving the ecosystem, is always negative,\u201d said Thielen.\n\nEther inched 0.17% higher to US$1,635.19 and was down 1.27% over the past seven days.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours and moved no higher than 1%. The exception was XRP, which led the winners by gaining 1.07% in the past 24 hours to US$0.5048, but remained 3.46% lower for the week.\n\nDogecoin led the losers, dropping 0.62% in the past 24 hours to US$0.06315 and stayed flat for the seven-day period.\n\nToncoin, the native token of Ton network, surged 23.86% in the past week, boosted by the network\u2019s launch of its new smart contract programming language Tact on August 22.\n\nTON stands for \u201cThe Open Network,\u201d a layer-1 blockchain originally developed by messaging service provider Telegram that withdrew from the project in 2020. TON launched the beta of its own crypto wallet service TON Space on August 10, which was integrated into the Telegram application at the very start.\n\n\u201cWith Telegram boasting a user base of 700 million, the platform presents a substantial opportunity for the distribution and onboarding of new users into the Toncoin ecosystem,\u201d said John Stefanidis, chief executive officer and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.09% to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume dropped 10.77% to US$19.78 billion.\n\nU.S. stock futures flat after Wall Street booked weekly gains\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia went higher on Monday morning, as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong kong. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged gains.\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading mixed with Dow futures and S&P 500 futures inching down while Nasdaq futures were edging higher. Wall Street closed varied at the end of regular session trading Friday, but all three major U.S. indexes booked weekly gains as Friday\u2019s labor market data eased rate hike worries. The U.S. stock market closes this Monday and will open on Tuesday,\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate rose to 3.8% in August, the highest reading since February 2022, according to the Labor Department on Friday, which could mitigate the concerns about further increases in the U.S. interest rates.\n\nGiven the uptick in unemployment rate, moderated job gains and wage growth, as well as an increase in labor force participation, \u201cthe U.S. August jobs report increases the probability that the highly data-dependent Fed will not hike again in this cycle,\u201d Mohamed A. El-Erian, an adviser to Germany-based financial services firm Allianz, tweeted on Friday.\n\nAdding to the optimistic outlook of the U.S. central bank\u2019s battle against inflation, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said on Thursday that \u201cinflation is conclusively on track toward 2% over a reasonable time frame,\u201d and that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy \u201cis already restrictive enough to get us there.\u201d\n\nThe Fed raised its interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% in July, the highest level in 22 years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said following July\u2019s meeting that the central bank will take a \u201cdata-dependent\u201d approach when deciding how to reduce the country\u2019s annual inflation below its long-term goal of 2%.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the Fed will maintain the current rate at its next meeting on September 20, up from 88% on Friday.\n\nInformation to notice in the week ahead includes the S&P\u2019s August U.S. services purchasing manager index (PMI) on Wednesday, as well as a series of Fed official speeches on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index logged its biggest weekly gains in over a month last Friday, as the country ramped up the policy supports for its ailing post-Covid economic recovery, according to Reuters on Monday. China\u2019s economic revival kit includes alleviating home-purchase restrictions in an attempt to stablize its wavering property market, as well as the country\u2019s top banks paving ways for more interest rate cuts.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Why cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are unlikely to disappear anytime soon - The Economic Times",
        "content": "I \u2019m sorry to say that Bitcoin has not been cancelled. After the FTX collapse, I had written that I was happy crypto had not been officially regulated in India. However, it\u2019s clear that apart from the taxation-based measures, there won\u2019t be a crypto ban in India, unlike, say, in China. This is fine. Crypto should not be regulated, and those who dabble in it should be left to their own devices. They should be free to go bankrupt in the manner and time they choose.At the same time, the FTX scam has not proven to be the death knell of crypto, something one could have hoped for. This implies that the cryptocurrency market may now be a permanent fixture in the global financial landscape . FTX has demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to attract billions from investors around the globe and squander it, and yet, fail to fundamentally challenge the underlying basis of cryptocurrency. The potential for profit is simply too great and too easy to attain. The prevailing opinion is that cryptocurrency is a valid asset class, and while there may be some regulatory hurdles, these will eventually be resolved. In time, another surge in value is inevitable, leading to a significant increase in the value of the surviving currencies and tokens. Consequently, a new wave of unsuspecting savers worldwide will jeopardise their finances. While many of the fringe cryptos have become irrelevant, Bitcoin has survived and has actually performed well enough for people to start getting fooled again. This year, for instance, despite the recent drops, Bitcoin is up 57%. In fact, from its low in November last year to its high in mid-July this year, Bitcoin has doubled.Any speculative asset that can randomly double and halve is well equipped to be exploited for luring newcomers. Clearly, this is the role that Bitcoin will play well from now onwards. Unfortunately, this could continue in the foreseeable future. Looking at the Bitcoin advocacy in social media, it becomes evident that the FTX crash and the post-FTX period have, in a somewhat paradoxical manner, benefited Bitcoin. The Bitcoin advocates\u2019 argument now is that if it has survived this, it will survive anything.At a rational level, it is not possible to refute this argument in a manner that will satisfy the surviving cryptomaniacs. To them, it\u2019s just the line of graph that matters. If someone\u2019s entire focus is on speculative trading without regard to the asset class, then Bitcoin serves perfectly well. In fact, it serves better than anything else because the more violent the gyrations of price, the more exciting the speculation. If something shoots up drastically and then falls as spectacularly, those who guess correctly will make that much more. This is like a drug to an addict. The crypto phenomenon cannot be understood without looking at the ordinary people who drive it. Some time ago, I read a book, Cryptostorm, written by business journalist Sundeep Khanna. It focuses almost entirely on people who got caught up in crypto. It\u2019s a very diverse set of people, with many defying our stereotypical image of cryptomaniacs.There\u2019s a small-town teacher, a hacker, a lawyer, and a student, among others. In many of these, one can see a yearning, a desire that if technology can create so many changes at such a fast pace, perhaps it can change money too. The entire crypto propaganda is based on inventing and exploiting this urge. Unfortunately for all these people, the rules of money and investing don\u2019t change. That\u2019s why this story will continue. Beyond criminal activities and ransomware, cryptocurrency is perfectly designed to take advantage of the savers, who lack the fundamental understanding about why some investments succeed and others seem too promising to be real. Human nature is invariably marked by greed, as well as the manipulation of this greed by others. That is not going to change.(The author is CEO, VALUE RESEARCH.)"

        "content": "In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, expressed her optimistic view on the intersection of Bitcoin (BTC) and artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nIn the post, Wood hinted at the transformative potential in the dynamic synergy between AI and Bitcoin, emphasizing the possibilities and positive implications the technologies hold for diverse industries and the overall economic landscape.\n\nThe convergence between Bitcoin - and AI could transform the way companies organize, causing a collapse in costs and an explosion in productivity. I was blown away by the possibilities these brilliant entrepreneurs are creating. Look for this podcast on Thursday! https://t.co/kPW92CuhFQ \u2014 Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) September 2, 2023\n\nBacking Wood\u2019s optimistic outlook is a research document published by ARK Invest titled \u201cInvesting In Artificial Intelligence: Where Will Equity Values Surface?,\u201c suggesting that both Wood and ARK Invest are assessing the significance of AI within investment strategies.\n\nThroughout the years, Wood has allocated investments to various AI-related stocks, demonstrating her strong belief in the rising technology. Wood\u2019s well-known enthusiasm for Bitcoin is evident through ARK\u2019s endeavors concerning a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Furthermore, ARK is no stranger to digital asset sector investments, with substantial holdings in Coinbase and Robinhood.\n\nRelated: Bitwise withdraws Bitcoin and Ether Market Cap ETF application\n\nThe document also highlights ARK Invest\u2019s strategies that have reaped rewards from investments in artificial intelligence tech stocks. The ARK Disruptive Innovation ETF, dedicated to AI and other pioneering technologies, outperformed the Nasdaq 100 Index, achieving a significant mid-year profit of 41.2%.\n\nWood\u2019s post, along with ARK\u2019s research, illustrates the growing influence of AI in the realm of investments. The fusion of Bitcoin and AI can potentially trigger a transformation in corporate operations, potentially reshaping productivity and cost dynamics. As investors explore fresh avenues for growth, Wood\u2019s nod to Bitcoin and AI could see more investment flowing into the two technologies in the future.\n\nMagazine: SEC calls ETF filings inadequate, Binance loses euro partner and other news: Hodler\u2019s Digest, June 25 \u2013 July 1"

        "content": "Members of the Sinaloa Cartel prepare capsules with methamphetamine in a safe house in Culiacan, Mexico, April 4, 2022. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\n\nWhat\u2019s the context? Crypto is being used for money laundering and to sell drugs online, posing a tough challenge for police fighting organized crime\n\nCryptocurrency use growing among drug traffickers\n\nBitcoin the most common payment in online drug sales\n\nMany law enforcement agencies lack crypto literacy BOGOTA/MEXICO CITY - For decades, drug traffickers carried their cash in suitcases to dodge banking controls, and the police. Today, many are also using virtual cryptocurrency wallets installed on their cellphones. When the U.S. Justice Department announced charges in April against four sons of jailed Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, the indictment said they had used \"untraceable cryptocurrency\" to launder the profits of their U.S. fentanyl smuggling operation. Known as the \"Chapitos\", the leaders of the Sinaloa cartel are accused of procuring chemicals from China to manufacture fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, in clandestine labs in Mexico for distribution in the United States. On the same day in April, U.S. authorities also announced the arrest in Guatemala of a wanted money launderer who they say worked for the cartel, accusing him of collecting $869,000 in drug profits and depositing the cash in cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nThe cases highlight how drug cartels and crime gangs in Latin America have taken up virtual currencies to launder money, receive payments and sell drugs on the darknet because law enforcement authorities are finding it harder to detect the deals, researchers and officials say. \"The technology is basically getting better and better which is making it even more difficult for law enforcement to go after these bad actors because this process provides and allows for anonymity,\" said Gretta Goodwin, a director in the Homeland Security and Justice team at the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), a congressional watchdog. Criminals use cryptocurrencies because it is an easy and efficient way to do business, particularly across borders, said Kim Grauer, a data scientist and cryptocurrency researcher. \"Cryptocurrency is really just used because it's a fast and instantaneous payment,\" said Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm. \"We are seeing a lot more cases popping up,\" she said. Cracks in regulation It is a trend organised crime groups in Brazil and Central America are also tapping into, according to a report published in the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs in March. The MS-13 criminal gang that operates in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala has been using bitcoin as a way for victims to hand over extortion payments and as payment for transporting cocaine to Mexico, the report found. It said organised crime groups are \"discovering growing cracks in the regional anti-money laundering architecture that make the switch to cryptocurrencies increasingly attractive.\" The report's co-author Douglas Farah said using cryptocurrency for laundering drug money was easier in countries with lax crypto regulation or where bitcoin is classified as a legal tender, such as El Salvador. \"Dollars can come in and out of bitcoin with no traceability ... there's zero control on bitcoin transactions, but there's no monitoring, no attempt to do anything about it,\" said Farah, who heads IBI Consultants, a U.S.-based security consulting firm, in reference to El Salvador.\n\nRepresentations of cryptocurrency exchange Binance and hard drugs are seen in this illustration taken, May 23, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Representations of cryptocurrency exchange Binance and hard drugs are seen in this illustration taken, May 23, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nTo move money through cryptocurrency platforms, criminals are taking advantage of unregulated exchanges that do not require proof of identification or registration information, said crypto intelligence company CipherTrace. In Mexico, to stop transactions being detected by authorities - who require registered cryptocurrency trading platforms to report transfers above 56,000 pesos ($3,300) - criminals buy and launder small amounts of bitcoin, found a 2021 report by the International Narcotics Control Board. Criminals operating in Latin America also hire the services of \"tumblers\" who, in exchange for a commission, mix identifiable crypto with illegal funds to make them harder to trace, according to CipherTrace. Yet most countries in the region have not updated their anti-money laundering regulations to include cryptocurrencies, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Countries with few or no compliance requirements around money laundering are proving attractive for criminals using cryptocurrency, said Goodwin from the GAO. \"They can use that to evade detection and identification by law enforcement, and we found that to be a major challenge,\" she said. 'No frontiers' The adoption of cryptocurrency in the narcotics trade also goes hand-in-hand with the rise of drug sales on the darknet - a hidden part of the internet, according to a 2021 UNODC report. It said Latin America and the Caribbean have experienced a \"sustained growth\" in the online trafficking of synthetic drugs and opioids, mostly using bitcoin - the first cryptocurrency to enter the market in 2009. In May, U.S. authorities said \"Operation SpecTor,\" which spanned three continents and aimed to disrupt fentanyl and opioid trafficking on the dark web, resulted in the seizure of $53.4 million in cash and cryptocurrencies. Drug traffickers have taken advantage of more people being online, and they also advertise drugs on dating sites and apps, such as Grindr and Tinder, the UNODC report says. Once sellers and buyers connect, communications tend to move to encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. It is a trend that increased during the COVID-19 pandemic when online platforms selling drugs grew as people were stuck at home, said Mariana Kiefer, UNODC's cybercrime Regional Coordinator for South America. \"Most online activities involved in drug trafficking are through cryptocurrencies. This is appealing to drug traffickers as they can reach more people online. The internet has no frontiers,\" said Kiefer. Crypto literate? Many virtual currency transactions are permanently recorded on public blockchains, which show all transactions between wallets, meaning police and researchers can trace transactions provided they have the right tools, software and expertise. In a 2021 study, Chainalysis was able to identify cryptocurrency addresses associated with suspected China-based fentanyl precursor sellers. It found the addresses had received more than $37.8 million worth of cryptocurrency since 2018.\n\nA breakthrough often hinges on whether it is possible to access the right cryptocurrency address that has received a payment allowing researchers to follow the money. \"We are making progress in how we are identifying these cryptocurrency addresses ... once you do, your world blows up with cryptocurrency because you have every single transaction that that address is ever associated with,\" said Grauer. But a key challenge is ensuring U.S. law enforcement and drug agencies are literate in cryptocurrencies so they understand \"what they are actually looking at,\" to build an investigation from complex databases, she said. U.S. law enforcement agencies are partnering with other experts to trace cryptocurrency payments as criminals adapt and use new technology to avoid detection, said Goodwin. \"It requires really sophisticated computer software programs, and some of the law enforcement agencies don't really have the in-house expertise that they would need,\" she said.

        "content": "El Salvador's Cuscatlan and Agricola banks have announced they will now accept Bitcoin for loan payments, paving the way for Bitcoin to be used directly for credit card debt settlements and loans, potentially setting global banking industry precedents.\n\nEl Salvador may be the most enthusiastic country to adopt Bitcoin. In addition to declaring it legal tender and investing in Bitcoin mining, the country now allows Bitcoin to serve as collateral for mortgages.\n\nTwo major banks in El Salvador, Cuscatlan and Agricola, have announced that they will now accept Bitcoin for loan payments. Customers can use Bitcoin to settle credit card debts or loans directly, eliminating the need for fiat conversion. This groundbreaking move was revealed through a tweet by Volcano Energy, a key player in El Salvador's emerging crypto landscape.\n\nThe announcement aligns with El Salvador\u2019s broader strategy to integrate cryptocurrency into its financial infrastructure. This is not just another step for Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, but a significant move that could set precedents for the banking industry globally.\n\nLegal Tender and Bitcoin Mining\n\nIn a landmark decision that garnered international attention, as reported by Blockchain.News, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele announced in June 2021 that the nation would be the first to make Bitcoin legal tender. Prior to this, Bitcoin had largely been regarded as a speculative asset, notorious for its price volatility.\n\non June, 2023, Volcano Energy, known for its renewable energy ventures, appears to be broadening its ecosystem to financial services that facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. The company has previously announced a $1 billion investment in a Bitcoin mining startup. This was part of a renewable energy initiative backed by Tether , aimed at making El Salvador a global hub for sustainable Bitcoin mining.\n\nWhile the announcement focuses on financial transactions, the sustainability angle offered by Volcano Energy shouldn\u2019t be ignored. El Salvador is already utilizing renewable resources for Bitcoin mining, and the same sustainable approach could be adopted for transactional services. As the nation attempts to make its financial system more resilient and self-reliant, sustainability may serve as a cornerstone.\n\nRegulatory and Financial Implications\n\nEl Salvador has been a forerunner in cryptocurrency adoption since it made Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021. However, this announcement from Cuscatlan and Agricola Banks, facilitated through Volcano Energy, could have far-reaching implications. It is yet to be seen how international bodies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and even US Federal Reserve will respond to El Salvador's banks incorporating Bitcoin payments for loans and credit cards.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nAs cryptocurrency becomes increasingly integrated into El Salvador's financial and energy sectors, the acceptance of Bitcoin by Cuscatlan and Agricola Banks marks a significant stride. This could pave the way for broader financial inclusivity and innovations in banking transactions, powered by renewable energy and blockchain technology. While it is too early to predict the full impact of this development, it surely positions El Salvador as a testbed for a new form of banking that incorporates cryptocurrencies.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Crypto veteran VC predicts 10-20x Bitcoin growth fueled by utility surge - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Jason Fang, founder of cryptocurrency investment firm Sora Ventures, recently offered unique perspectives on market trends and Bitcoin\u2019s untapped potential, drawn from his firsthand experience across multiple crypto cycles.\n\nFang highlighted how quickly the crypto market can pivot, noting that DeFi and NFT mania went mainstream within two years despite early skepticism. Fang believes Bitcoin development is progressing faster than many realize and will similarly surprise skeptics.\n\nRecalling the past bear markets, Fang described how the Bitcoin price plunged, and his fund dropped 80% at one point, an atypical story in crypto that year. However, Fang managed to survive as a part of only a \u201chandful\u201d of other \u2018web3\u2019 funds in Asia at the time.\n\nHowever, Fang expressed conviction in Bitcoin\u2018s resilience and indicated the panacea to its volatility, saying, \u201cIf Bitcoin goes to zero, then the entire Web3 industry goes to zero.\u201d He contrasted Bitcoin\u2019s battle-tested network to newer chains like Solana and Avalanche that haven\u2019t experienced a bear market.\n\nFrom its foundations, Fang sees Bitcoin at over $200,000 achieved through increased on-chain utility as he compared Bitcoin to Ethereum in 2017. With Bitcoin having a limited dApp ecosystem today versus Ethereum having similar numbers back when it was $80, he believes a 10-20x Bitcoin price gain is achievable as Bitcoin utility grows.\n\nIn the interview, Fang elaborated on specific areas where he expects to see expanded utility built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nHe pointed to the development of BRC-20 tokens as a major area of interest and excitement, especially in Asian crypto communities. Fang believes the first major BRC-20 project successfully launched and listed on top exchanges would spark tremendous interest and further development.\n\nBeyond tokens, Fang sees parallels to Ethereum in Bitcoin\u2019s ability to mimic many of the same decentralized finance and NFT use cases, albeit built with different technical stacks. He emphasized that while the path will diverge from Ethereum, Bitcoin will ultimately be capable of delivering similar utility to users.\n\nOverall, Fang\u2019s perspective highlights the breadth of potential he sees in Bitcoin to move far beyond just a store of value into a thriving ecosystem for new blockchain-based applications.\n\nWho is Jason Fang?\n\nFang\u2019s early exposure to entrepreneurship began in college, where he started an \u201cUber for tutoring\u201d platform despite having no formal computer science education. Driven to build his idea, Fang taught himself to code over several months.\n\nAfter graduation, Fang joined Fenbushi Capital, an early cryptocurrency venture capital firm where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin was also involved. This opportunity introduced Fang to the emerging world of blockchain technology and crypto assets.\n\nIn 2017, Fang founded Sora Ventures and began investing in Ethereum-based tokens and projects. However, when the crypto bear market hit in 2018, the value of Sora\u2019s investments dropped 80%, while many other crypto funds folded at the time, as mentioned previously.\n\nDespite this setback, Fang persevered by buying out dissatisfied investors to give Sora more time to recoup losses. He also made prudent exits during the following bull market. Thanks to Fang\u2019s persistence and strategic moves, Sora emerged in a strong position coming out of the bear market years.\n\nIn 2023, Sora has pivoted to focus heavily on Bitcoin investments, becoming the most active institutional investor in Bitcoin startups year to date. The firm led a $3 million investment in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s new crypto fund and sponsored the Bitcoin Startup Lab hackathon with $50,000, the largest Bitcoin hackathon prize this year.\n\nWhen asked why he is so optimistic about Bitcoin, Fang said he sees \u201chuge potential as it gets more developers and apps built on top of it, like Ethereum has.\u201d He believes Bitcoin\u2019s price could easily explode from today\u2019s levels as utility expands.\n\nFang advises new Bitcoin entrepreneurs that \u201cBitcoin will be a big game changer in the next wave. The use cases now are just the beginning.\u201d He encourages visionaries to get involved early and build the next generation of Bitcoin applications.\n\nFang\u2019s undeterred spirit after setbacks, sharp strategic pivots, and proactive investments in the Bitcoin ecosystem offer invaluable lessons for newcomers. His personal journey typifies the grit required to drive innovation on emerging technologies like Bitcoin.\n\nDisclosure: Sora Ventures is an investor in CryptoSlate."

        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) price correction down to $22,000 is becoming increasingly likely, as BTC derivatives have begun to exhibit bearish tendencies.\n\nThe price chart of Bitcoin leaves little doubt that investor sentiment has worsened since Grayscale\u2019s much-hyped legal victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 29 and the SEC\u2019s subsequent postponement of multiple spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) requests.\n\nThe central question remains whether the prospects of an ETF can outweigh the growing risks.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF hype is fading\n\nBy Aug. 18, the entire 19% rally that occurred following BlackRock's ETF initial filing had fully retracted as Bitcoin moved back to $26,000\n\nNext, there was a failed attempt to reclaim the $28,000 support as investors raised the odds of an ETF approval following the positive news regarding Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin trust request.\n\nBitcoin/USD price index, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nCryptocurrency investors\u2019 morale deteriorated as the S&P 500 index closed at 4,515 on Sept. 1, merely 6.3% below its all-time high from January 2022. Even gold, which hasn\u2019t been able to break above the $2,000 level since mid-May, is 6.5% away from its all-time high. Consequently, the general feeling for Bitcoin investors just seven months ahead of its halving in 2024 is certainly less positive than expected.\n\nSome analysts pin Bitcoin\u2019s lackluster performance on the ongoing regulatory actions against the two leading exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Moreover, multiple sources claim that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is likely to indict Binance in a criminal probe. The claims are based on allegations of money laundering and potential violations of sanctions involving Russian entities.\n\nRelated: Weekly close risks BTC price \u2018double top\u2019 \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nNorth Node Capital chief investment officer and Bitcoin supporter Pentoshi expressed the current conditions in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter):\n\nI think we still will eventually get some bearish Binance news vs DoJ. That should be seen as opportunity!\n\n\n\nBut overall.

Don\u2019t lose sight of the\u2026 \u2014 Pentoshi euroPeng (@Pentosh1) September 1, 2023\n\nAccording to Pentoshi, the potential gains from a spot ETF approval outweigh the price impact of regulatory actions against the exchanges. There\u2019s no way to ascertain whether such an assumption is valid, but such an analysis fails to consider that U.S. inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has come down to 3.2% in July 2023 from 9.1% in June 2022.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s total assets have been reduced to $8.12 trillion, down from the recent $8.73 peak in March 2023. This signals that the monetary authority has been draining liquidity from the markets, which is detrimental to Bitcoin\u2019s inflation protection thesis.\n\nLooking at a longer time frame, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been holding the $25,000 level since mid-March, but taking a closer look at derivatives data shows that bulls\u2019 conviction is getting tested.\n\nBitcoin derivatives show decreasing demand from bulls\n\nBitcoin monthly futures typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin one-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current 3.5% futures premium (basis rate) is at its lowest point since mid-June, prior to BlackRock\u2019s filing for a spot ETF. This indicator reflects a decreased demand for leverage buyers utilizing derivatives contracts.\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become less optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, the options\u2019 25% delta skew has recently entered bearish territory, with protective put (sell) options trading at a 9% premium on Sept. 4 compared with similar call (buy) options.\n\nBTC futures hint at $22,000 next\n\nBitcoin derivatives data suggests that the bearish momentum is gaining strength, especially since the approval of a spot ETF could potentially be deferred until 2024, given the SEC\u2019s concerns about the lack of measures to prevent a significant portion of trading occurring on unregulated offshore exchanges based on stablecoins.\n\nMeanwhile, the uncertainty in the regulatory landscape does favor the bears, as there\u2019s no way to dismiss the fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding potential actions from the DOJ or the ongoing lawsuits against exchanges by the SEC.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF applications: Who is filing and when the SEC may decide\n\nUltimately, a retracement down to $22,000 \u2014 the level last seen when Bitcoin\u2019s futures premium was 3.5% \u2014 is the most likely scenario, considering the recent inability to sustain a positive price momentum despite the heightened chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The club, based in Bedford, a market town with a population of 170,000 in Bedfordshire, England, is the passion project of local owner and Bitcoin evangelist Peter McCormack.\n\nThe host of the \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did\u201d podcast \u2014 a Bitcoin-based current affairs show that positions the cryptocurrency as a remedy for socioeconomic issues such as rising inflation and state debt \u2014 spoke animatedly on the day of the match about the changes the club has seen under his ownership, and the role that Bitcoin has played in it.\n\n\u201cTeams should care about something,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery club has a history of where it came from. It\u2019s usually the community they were in.\u201d His ownership has brought with it the international reach and decentralized philosophy of Bitcoin \u2014 a \u201cglobal community that cares about hard working people not having the fruits of their labor debased by government mismanagement of money,\u201d he added.\n\nBut financial reliance on a cryptocurrency brings with it certain complications \u2014 including market volatility and industry implosions beyond the Real Bedford owner\u2019s control.\n\nBear market\n\nMcCormack completed the purchase of Real Bedford \u2014 a South Midlands Division One side then known as Bedford FC \u2014 in April 2022 on the back of various business ventures linked to Bitcoin. He said at the time of the takeover that, with Bitcoin-backed financing, he wants to put the club in a position to rise nine tiers to the Premier League \u2014 the pinnacle of English football.\n\n3/ So what is the plan? To get our club into the Premier League, 9 promotions\u2026\n\n\u2026I am a bitcoiner, we aim big.

But in March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. Then in May that year, stablecoin platform Terra-Luna collapsed, followed by the FTX cryptocurrency exchange in November. A bear market mentality settled over the crypto industry as investors shied away from riskier assets, including Bitcoin. Prices dropped, while over US$2 trillion was wiped off the wider market.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a high of almost US$70,000, Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted to less than US$16,000 by the end of 2022. While it recovered some of that ground to trade within the US$26,000 range as of early September, analysts expect macroeconomic concerns to continue to weigh on the token\u2019s price \u2014 at least in the short term.\n\n\u201cThe main headwind for crypto is rising real interest rates,\u201d said Samuel Lee, founder of U.S.-based SVRN Asset Management, an investment advisory firm. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see a sustained resurgence until interest rates drop back down again and people forget about the trauma and folly of the last bubble.\u201d\n\nCould an extended period of crypto winter combined with further declines in the price of Bitcoin impact Real Bedford?\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t worry me because I fundamentally believe there\u2019s a far higher chance of the pound failing than Bitcoin,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cI think a more important question is: is the club sustainable if we don\u2019t keep winning?\u201d\n\nLocal link\n\nReal Bedford field\n\nAs the referee blew his whistle for the start of last week\u2019s game at McMullen Park, the realities of ninth-tier English football set in. With the music off, the fans quietened down, their cheers replaced by the sound of the wind blowing through the trees lining the ground and a motorway running opposite. It was a long way from the glamor of the Premier League.\n\n\u201cBedford isn\u2019t really known for anything,\u201d said McCormack, 44, who has lived in the town most of his life. \u201cIf a tourist comes to the U.K., most people go to London or Manchester or Bath. There\u2019s no reason to come to Bedford.\u201d\n\nMark Anderson, a local software engineer who volunteers at the club on Saturdays, was more direct. \u201cBedfordshire is basically the arse-end of the nice bits,\u201d he said, referring to the county\u2019s location north of Greater London on the periphery of some of Britain\u2019s most desirable real estate.\n\nBut it is McCormack\u2019s connection to the local area, the Real Bedford owner said, that gives him an advantage over other sporting ownership models backed by digital assets.\n\n\u201cThis has meaning to me because it\u2019s my town,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019m doing. The town of Bedford should have a team in the Football League.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to fourth-tier English football team Crawley Town \u2014 bought by U.S. crypto consortium WAGMI United in April 2022 \u2014 as an example of an ownership model without a link to the local community. WAGMI, like McCormack, promised to take the club to the pinnacle of English football. But rather than Bitcoin, they planned to use sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to build Crawley\u2019s brand and establish an international fan base.\n\nThe project got off to a promising start, earning \u00a33.5 million (US$4.4 million) from its first NFT drop. But against the backdrop of last year\u2019s turbulence in the crypto market, the new owners became increasingly involved in day-to-day footballing operations \u2014 including a brief stint on the coach\u2019s bench for co-owner Preston Johnson. The club went into a tailspin, suffering its worst finish in twelve years in the football league and narrowly avoiding relegation.\n\nWhile WAGMI United didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, Reuben Watt, Chair of the Crawley Town Supporters Alliance, said that by the end of last season, confidence in the group\u2019s ownership was at an \u201call-time low.\u201d He worried that the owners had consistently focused on pleasing NFT holders over local fans.\n\nConcern among fans appears to have sunk in. WAGMI appointed Sam Jordan, a member of the Supporter\u2019s Alliance, to the board of directors in August.\n\n\u201cI think the appointment of Sam to the club\u2019s board is a huge turning point for the club,\u201d said Watt. \u201cHad WAGMI got in someone with knowledge of English football straight away and put a fan on the board, then we would\u2019ve been in a better situation.\u201d\n\nMcCormack didn\u2019t hold back in his criticism of the Crawley owners. \u201cI think they bought it as a toy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey bought a toy under the hype, probably watched a bunch of Ted Lasso and got excited. They\u2019ve done a terrible job.\u201d\n\nHe also identified issues with the WAGMI group\u2019s association with crypto assets like meme coins and NFTs \u2014 which are fundamentally different, he said, to Bitcoin \u2014 as another flaw in its business model.\n\n\u201cThey basically want to just get people to buy crap that will lose value \u2014 which has been proven historically \u2014 whereas for us, Bitcoin is a monetary asset,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis war we see between Bitcoin and crypto is reflected in the ethos of how we run our clubs. Bitcoin is in our DNA, but we\u2019re also about building that feeling around the town that this is a community thing,\u201d he added.\n\nBitcoin backers\n\nwhT81kxU7gg7esBeHPNaCYf4 aXkds0rZ3CDdLcCpVFXzp9CXDRPsYW0Y6c9dn8ej6jiPyg3nbMizkq7sWcNQFq1YdI2s4AHRuJLfsIsCYXJVkEy tVqZeDy3CE4f3a114Gsd57XuC8QqHfZ5mEiFo\n\nLast season, Real Bedford won its division at a canter, earning promotion to the South Midlands Premier Division. Much of the financing behind that run came from large-scale sponsorship. The club has partnership agreements with a host of Bitcoin companies, including Iris Energy, a sustainable Bitcoin mining firm; Galaxy, a crypto firm dealing in corporate finance; and Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAccording to the club\u2019s records, sponsorship provided \u00a3387,900 (US$491,000) out of the club\u2019s \u00a3549,507 (US$696,000) revenue in the 22/23 season \u2014 a significant amount given that ninth-tier clubs typically only have sponsorship deals in the four to five figure range.\n\nThe revenue brought in through tie-ups with the likes of Gemini \u2014 who, according to a spokesperson, view the Real Bedford partnership as a form of Bitcoin-backed community building \u2014 allows the club to make improvements to its facilities and player welfare in a way unmatched by the league\u2019s other teams.\n\nAnd while the sponsorship revenue gives the club a huge advantage in its ability to attract players, the Bitcoin connection also acts as a magnet for attracting supporters from further afield \u2014 football fans who may not otherwise have chosen Bedford as a place to spend their Saturday afternoons.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, over 100 people have come in from other countries to watch the games here,\u201d McCormack says. \u201cWe had 12 come in from Slovakia! That\u2019s insane! And they\u2019re spending money in the hotels, in the bars, in the restaurants \u2014 that money supports our local economy.\u201d\n\nThe 256% rise in matchday attendances since the takeover has put a strain on facilities unready for the increased level of interest. The club were averaging just 40 attendees per week when McCormack took over, whereas CEO Emma Firman wrote in the week\u2019s program notes that the club is now working with local businesses to expand its designated parking for the game.\n\n\u201cOur match days are getting busier, which is exciting for everyone here at the club as more people recognise our exciting project at McMullen Park,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSustainable growth\n\nBut for all the club\u2019s progress, the club\u2019s ownership model is reliant on Bitcoin-affiliated sponsors impacted by the ongoing bear market.\n\nThe club still sits five rungs below McCormack\u2019s medium-term target of the Football League \u2014 tiers 2 to 4 \u2014 where budgets of newly promoted sides are \u00a31-3 million. Getting there will require sustained success for the next half-decade \u2014 not just for the team, but for Bitcoin-backed sponsors who will have to weather any further market volatility and declines in the token\u2019s price.\n\nCompanies across the sector have been forced to push through large-scale layoffs over the past year, with Real Bedford\u2019s main sponsor Gemini undergoing three consecutive rounds of job cuts between July 2022 and January 2023. Their spending on TV and digital advertisements alone fell from US$3.8 million to US$478,000 between May and November 2022, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cCrypto sponsor\u2019s rich marketing budgets depended on the huge crypto bubble that allowed them to raise money effortlessly,\u201d said SVRN\u2019s Samuel Lee.\n\n\u201cWith the collapse in crypto prices and waning interest in crypto, money is unsurprisingly tight. I think crypto companies are starting to realize that the payoff for expensive sports sponsorships isn\u2019t as high as they thought,\u201d Lee added.\n\nMcCormack said that he personally has little concern for a Bitcoin price drop. The U.K. economy and the pound are more vulnerable to volatility in light of the government\u2019s debt burden, he said. But he did stress the importance of achieving stability beyond a reliance on Real Bedford\u2019s Bitcoin backers.\n\ndfrkKFeDIbN5Rl X2KE5IGi543Qeb7GGim6vc 4i0IvKc3zbD0jaCDxUNRbA 3DWyUV2K Yct67s1hvuPoqI8nmUEDCBja7RNxHeGIIJ2YaQSdCaVGs OFK26ALHBBvUe xqgBZxjLBb2v2 urlfbo8\n\nOne way to do that, he said, is by growing crowds through a brand of football fans can engage with. That starts with the club\u2019s skull-heavy rebrand as The Pirates and a ramped up social media presence that leans heavily into the idea of the world\u2019s first Bitcoin-backed team as rock-n-roll disruptors.\n\n\u201cYou give people a brand of football they can support,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cWe have skulls. Skulls are f\u2013king cool. We play heavy metal when they come on the pitch. And have you seen our tunnel?\u201d\n\nBitcoin in the community\n\nThe team\u2019s brand also involves strong connections with the local area, not just through the men\u2019s team, but through community initiatives, youth and women\u2019s football. The recent FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand drew record global audiences and McCormack said he sees potential for women\u2019s football as a growth market for Real Bedford.\n\nThe club began its expansion in this area by completing a merger with Bedford Ladies and Girls FC in June. McCormack has raised the budget for the women\u2019s team, and is aiming for commercial parity with the men\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a commercial reason to do that because the town will recognize it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might come and watch, or bring their daughters to come and watch. Some people might say, \u2018oh, that\u2019s so woke\u2019 or whatever. But no, it\u2019s a commercially astute decision.\u201d\n\nMcCormack\u2019s emphasis on community building signposts a potential route for the club through the crypto winter and continuing Bitcoin bear market.\n\nUnlike Crawley, where the division between crypto backers and footballing matters has dissolved to the detriment of the club, McCormack maintains that a solid distance is kept between Real Bedford\u2019s Bitcoin financing and the team.\n\n\u201cIf you just want to come for the football, you can just have a full football experience and not have [Bitcoin] forced down your throat,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cThere\u2019s even an article on our website that says why you should not buy Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn the short term at least, Real Bedford\u2019s focus is on growing the crowds and their fan base. And that means continuing to win, regardless of where the financing comes from.\n\n\u201cThe team\u2019s job is not to care about Bitcoin; the manager\u2019s job is not to care about Bitcoin, their job is to win games,\u201d McCormack said.\n\nAt last week\u2019s game, everyone played their parts to perfection.\n\nREAL BEDFORD 9 \u2013 1 ROTHWELL CORINTHIANS."

Analysts had predicted that the SEC may not decide on an ETF until early 2024 when the final deadlines approach (listed below).\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF decision deadlines. Source: Bloomberg/Twitter\n\nJohn Glover, chief investment officer at crypto lending platform Ledn, told Cointelegraph that the ARK 21Shares \u201cverdict slated for Jan. 10 will be the first real indicator as to whether the SEC is ready to start approving these types of applications. The final deadline is up at that point, and a decision will need to be made one way or another.\u201d\n\nWhy has the SEC rejected spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past?\n\nIn its earlier rejection of VanEck\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, the SEC claimed that the Bitcoin market is not big or mature enough to sustain ETF market demand. The commission also said the price volatility and inadequate level of trading surveillance could potentially leave the market prone to fraud and manipulation.\n\nHowever, with the entrance of BlackRock, market pundits have started to believe that the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved are good.\n\nRecent: AI could revolutionize human resources, but there are risks\n\nOne of the major factors preventing a spot ETF from getting approved is the nature of the fund.\n\nA futures ETF is based on futures contracts rather than the digital asset itself, which is an important distinction. The futures markets are already heavily regulated to prevent market manipulation, thus making it easier for the SEC to approve such ETFs.\n\nAt the heart of these spot ETF rejections is the issuer\u2019s requirement to incorporate a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d with a sufficiently large and regulated Bitcoin-related market. Such agreements are integral in ensuring that the SEC can conduct exhaustive investigations in the event of any market irregularities.\n\nA Bitfinex Alpha analyst told Cointelegraph that one of the vital concerns behind the rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs is the regulator\u2019s ability to track and continuously ensure asset safety and custody. However, for that to happen, the U.S. needs more regulatory and legal infrastructure before the \u201cSEC or other involved parties would be comfortable in allowing an ETF provider to handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf not, then the entire purpose of an ETF (which is to circumvent dealing with digital asset wallets or crypto exchanges) is defeated. Thus, it would not be fair to say that spot Bitcoin ETFs do not propose manipulation concerns in the SEC\u2019s eyes. The ProShares Bitcoin ETF disapproval dated back to 2018 clarifies this very point. Another concern with regard to the document\u2019s literature was the ability of the Bitcoin market to handle the volume that would be brought in via the introduction of a spot ETF,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nThe SEC is mainly concerned about the robustness of the trading venues. The regulator oversees futures exchanges like the CME and the Cboe, and any futures ETFs will be restricted to only trading on those regulated venues. Whereas there are no SEC-regulated spot exchanges.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with the SEC\u2019s assumptions about the vulnerabilities of the spot crypto ETF market. James Koutoulas, the founder of a futures-focused hedge fund Typhon, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cI can attest that the crypto futures are far inferior to the spot in terms of tracking error. The concept that a U.S. regulator can provide adequate \u2018surveillance\u2019 against market manipulation on a global 12-figure market is delusional. So, honestly, it probably comes down to passing the buck to the CFTC rather than retaining accountability. Given the SEC has an \u2018investor protection\u2019 mandate.\u201d\n\nHe added that by continuing to reject the simplest products like a BTC ETF, the \u201dSEC keeps pushing demand for crypto offshore and unregulated players. While a BTC ETF may not be perfect, it is much safer than buying BTC with Gensler\u2019s family friend SBF [Sam Bankman-Fried] at FTX.\u201d\n\nRichard Gardener, CEO of tech infrastructure firm Modulus, believes futures ETFs have long been seen as more palatable for regulators and that the decision over a spot ETF is a matter of when not if.\n\nHe told Cointelegraph that a spot BTC ETF is \u201ccoming, sooner rather than later, and the heavy investment from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity signal this. As long as the major players are in the hunt, the industry is seen as viable in the long term, despite any short-term setbacks. If the SEC continues to refuse to act, politicians will be forced to act and develop their own answer to the crypto dilemma.\u201d\n\nEther futures ETF have more chances of approval\n\nWhile crypto enthusiasts would prefer to see spot ETFs, which would legitimize crypto as an asset class, U.S. regulators seem more likely to support futures ETFs.\n\nBloomberg analysts have predicted that the chances of approval for an Ether (ETH) futures-derived ETF are over 90%, with nearly a dozen institutions lined up for approval.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in\n\nReports in financial media suggested a high possibility of the SEC approving an Ether futures-based ETF as soon as October.\n\nThis not surprising to us, we had said they would approve Ether Futures early on in race. Nice to be validated. Now what does it mean for spot? Hard to say beyond it shows that their views/policy/tolerance can change. https://t.co/JXCxNUpj2U \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 17, 2023\n\nKen Timsit, managing director at blockchain startup accelerator Cronos Labs, told Cointelegraph that the \u201cthesis in favor of futures is that futures would enable investors to send signals about the price evolutions expected by the market, which in turn would help to dampen the volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum price and counterbalance the large price swings that we have seen recently.\u201d\n\nDoug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Asset Research, told Cointelegraph that the \u201cnear-term psychological impact would most likely give a boost to crypto markets as another proof point that regulators remain open to evolving the listed space and continued hope for the elusive spot ETF.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

Ether dipped to near the US$1,600 mark, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP posted the biggest gains while Solana led the losers. Digital asset investment products saw a minor outflow last week accompanied by a surge in trading volumes, indicating mixed sentiment among institutional investors. U.S. stock futures traded mixed ahead of regular trading following the long holiday weekend.\n\nBitcoin below US$26,000\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.57% in the last 24 hours to US$25,804.63 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 1.15%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency had been trading in the US$26,000 range since Friday. It briefly breached US$28,000 last Tuesday as an apparent victory for Grayscale Investment against the U.S. Securties and Exchange Commission boosted sentiment. That optimism has now cooled.\n\nEther dipped 0.49% to US$1,627.26, losing 1.58% over the past seven days.\n\nThe crypto market is suffering from regulatory uncertainties in the U.S., said Samer Hasn, market analyst for online brokerage XS.com, in an emailed comment.

That was a slowdown from US$168 million last week, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Despite the small outflow, digital investment products\u2019 trading volume totaled US$2.8 billion, a 90% rise on the year-to-date average.\n\n\u201cThe recent minor outflows from digital asset funds may be due to uncertainty around the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 following an initial surge of enthusiasm upon their announcement,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, it will be interesting to see how these regulatory uncertainties are balanced,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event will see the amount of new tokens issued every 10 minutes cut in half, increasing its scarcity. This is widely anticipated to produce a surge in the token\u2019s price. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024.\n\nElsewhere, crypto exchange Bybit introduced TradeGPT on Monday \u2014 an artificial intelligence-powered education tool that uses ChatGPT to generate market analysis and answer technical questions based on Bybit\u2019s real-time market data.

A PMI reading above 50 indicates a growth in business activities, while a sub-50 reading indicates a contraction.\n\nThe PMI report followed an unexpected expansion in China\u2019s manufacturing industry on September 1. But a slowdown of growth in the services industry provides more evidence of a wider economic downturn.\n\n\u201cThe marginal slowdown in the services sector\u2019s supply and demand expansion offset the improvement in manufacturing production and demand,\u201d Wang Zhe, an economist at Caixin Insight Group, told Reuters. \u201cThere was still considerable downward pressure on the economy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Japan\u2019s manufacturing PMI rose from 53.8 in July to 54.3 in August \u2014 the highest reading in three months, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA stronger improvement in new orders received by Japanese service firms underpinned an acceleration in business activity growth,\u201d Usamah Bhatti, an economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Reuters. \u201cThat said, service providers signalled a steeper increase in inflationary pressures during August.\u201d\n\nInvestors now await a decision on interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia expected later Tuesday.

        "title": "Grayscale victory, SEC delays decision on Bitcoin ETFs: Law Decoded - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On Aug. 29, crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments scored a major victory against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in its efforts to convert its over-the-counter Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a listed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The U.S. Court of Appeals Circuit Judge Neomi Rao ordered Grayscale\u2019s petition for review be granted and the SEC\u2019s order to deny the GBTC listing application be vacated. Previously, Rao said that the SEC did not \u201coffer any explanation\u201d as to why Grayscale was in the wrong.\n\nInitial enthusiasm in the crypto community about the victory was tempered by the understanding of the limits of the court\u2019s decision. \u201cSo far, every time they lose in court they just shamelessly say the judge got it wrong and pursue more shenanigans,\u201d Delphi Labs general counsel Gabriel Shapiro said. According to Zero Knowledge Consulting managing partner Austin Campbell: \u201cFor many companies, fighting back is incredibly expensive (you will win, but you\u2019ll be bankrupt when you do) or you\u2019re a financial conglomerate where the SEC can fuck up the rest of your business in the meantime. Gangster behavior.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC has postponed its decisions on six applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs. It has designated a longer period in which it may review applications from WisdomTree, VanEck, Invesco Galaxy, Bitwise and Valkyrie, as well as the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust proposed by Fidelity. The SEC will have another 45 days upon publication in the Federal Register to consider the proposed rule changes allowing the listing of the investment vehicles, giving the regulator until October to approve, deny or delay a decision.\n\nTravel Rule comes into effect in the United Kingdom\n\nCrypto asset businesses in the United Kingdom could now begin withholding certain crypto transfers to comply with the new Travel Rule for crypto that came into effect last week. From now on, if an inbound payment is received from a person or entity from an overseas jurisdiction that hasn\u2019t implemented the Travel Rule, the virtual asset service provider must make a \u201crisk-based assessment\u201d as to \u201cwhether to make the crypto assets available to the beneficiary.\u201d The same rule applies to Brits looking to send payments outside the United Kingdom.\n\nContinue reading\n\nFirst unregistered securities sales claim against NFT offering in the United States\n\nThe SEC has accused Impact Theory \u2014 a media and entertainment company headquartered in Los Angeles \u2014 of engaging in unregistered securities transactions by selling nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to investors from October to December 2021. Allegedly, it raised almost $30 million through the sales of NFTs it called Founder\u2019s Keys, which were offered in three tiers. The company \u201cencouraged potential investors to view the purchase of a Founder\u2019s Key as an investment into the business,\u201d according to the SEC.\n\nContinue reading\n\nCrypto declared a property by a Chinese court\n\nA People\u2019s Court in China published a report on the legality of virtual assets, analyzing the criminal law attributes of these digital assets. The court noted in its report that virtual assets under the current legal policy framework are still legal property and protected by law.\n\nThe \u201cIdentification of the Property Attributes of Virtual Currency and Disposal of Property Involved in the Case\u201d report acknowledged that virtual assets have economic attributes and thus can be classified as property. Although China has deemed all foreign digital assets illegal by imposing a blanket ban, the report argues that virtual assets held by individuals should be considered legal and protected by law under the current policy framework.\n\nContinue reading\n\nFurther reads\n\nKentucky regulator denies plan for subsidizing crypto mining facility\n\nBinance Australia GM \u2018really confident\u2019 regulators will side with crypto\n\nMiCA: The good, the bad and the ugly of the EU\u2019s crypto rules\n\nPioneering the future with omnichain solutions: XGo ID and TapiocaDAO share insights\n\nWill Evergrande\u2019s collapse have a silver lining for crypto?"

        "content": "Mon 04 Sep 2023 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Fenelon L.\n\nAmid alarming inflation, a new trend is emerging in Turkey: more than half the population is now embracing cryptocurrencies as a financial haven. Here\u2019s an overview of this transformation.\n\nKey points:\n\nMassive crypto adoption in Turkey following rapid inflation;\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum dominate investment choices;\n\nYoung Turkish women show growing interest in crypto.\n\nIncreased crypto adoption in Turkey amid inflation\n\nFacing unbridled inflation, Turkey is witnessing a growing infatuation with cryptocurrencies. According to a recent study by KuCoin, Turkish adoption of cryptos has soared from 40% to a notable 52% in just eighteen months.\n\nKuCoin, one of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange platforms, highlighted this development. Their study indicates that more and more Turks see crypto assets as a shield against the rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira. Faced with a lira that has fallen by more than 50% against the dollar, citizens are looking for solid financial alternatives.\n\n\u201cOur observations on Turkey, combined with other previous country studies, show that the increase in the number and percentage of crypto investors reflects a growing confidence and infatuation with cryptocurrency. This is all the more marked with the Turkish lira having lost more than 50% of its value against the US dollar,\u201d a KuCoin representative told Decrypt.\n\nHowever, Turkey is not an isolated case. Similar trends have been noticed in Brazil and Nigeria. Cryptocurrencies seem to offer a safe haven for many people in the face of depreciating local currencies. The figures bear this out: 58% of those surveyed see cryptocurrency as a long-term investment, while 37% see it as a reliable means of preserving their capital.\n\nFrom Bitcoins to women investors: Turkey redefines the Crypto landscape\n\nTurkish investors\u2019 enthusiasm for Bitcoin is undeniable: 71% of them hold BTC. Ethereum comes next, chosen by 45% of investors. While historically the world of crypto investing has been predominantly male, in Turkey the situation is changing. Today, almost half (47%) of investors in the 18-30 age bracket are women.\n\nBeyond its growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, Turkey is nurturing broader ambitions. It is also considering setting up its own central bank digital currency, the Digital Lira.\n\nIn conclusion, in the face of its economic challenges, Turkey sees crypto as a notable opportunity. More than a mere observer of the rise of cryptos, it aspires to position itself as a key player in the digital revolution with its own central bank digital currency, the Digital Lira.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies exhibited a mixed trading performance on Sunday as traders evaluated the latest U.S. jobs report.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Bitcoin BTC/USD +0.14% $25,895 Ethereum ETH/USD -0.05% $1632 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -0.42% $0.063\n\nWhat Happened: The latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report revealed some notable trends in the job market. In August, the unemployment rate edged up to 3.8%, its highest level in over a year, contrary to economists\u2019 expectations of it remaining at 3.5%.\n\nAdditionally, average hourly earnings only increased by 4.3% year-over-year, falling short of economists\u2019 projected 4.4% increase as the economy continues to slow down and pricing pressures ease. While job growth in August exceeded expectations with the addition of 187,000 jobs, it\u2019s worth noting that the job numbers for June and July were revised down by a combined 110,000.\n\nGold, Silver Or Bitcoin: What Is The Best Hedge Against Inflation?

Bitcoin\u2019s dominance serves as an indicator of the strength or weakness of altcoins. In addition to that, it is important to note that the best investment decisions are often made when one feels the least confident about them. This seems to be the case right now.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth mentioning that Bitcoin dominance is not continuing its upward momentum, but rather declining.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital said on X about the imminent risk of Bitcoin breaking down from a bearish double top pattern. According to his analysis, if a sell-off event occurs with significant trading volume, it could potentially trigger the breakdown process.\n\n\"BTC is on the cusp of validating its double top formation. A breakout on seller volume and a convincing loss of ~$26,000 followed by turning it into new resistance would confirm the breakdown.\"\n\nRekt Capital notes that Bitcoin\u2019s current price action is reminiscent of its late 2021 pattern, when it experienced a breakdown from a double top formation, signaling the end of its previous bull market.In 2021, BTC formed two distinct tops, similar to a double top, before eventually reaching a third top at a lower high.\n\nCrypto Tony said before we will see Altcoins pump 100x or 200x in the next bull run, they will tend to lay dormant for a while after putting in lows, which he expects later this year. \u201cOur job is to identify the accumulation zones and get in before the next big moves begin.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF: coming after Grayscale victory - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Last week, Grayscale won its lawsuit against the SEC over the agency\u2019s refusal to approve spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis victory could have a significant impact on the crypto market, and not just in the long term.\n\nApproval of Bitcoin ETFs following Grayscale\u2019s victory\n\nThe first consequence could be that the SEC will finally be forced to approve spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIt should be recalled that in the US, the SEC has so far only approved ETFs based on bitcoin price futures contracts, and not yet ETFs backed directly by BTC (so-called spot bitcoin ETFs).\n\nIn addition, spot bitcoin ETFs have been approved in other parts of the world, including neighbouring Canada.\n\nThe ruling by the Southern District Court of New York, which gave Grayscale the right to do so, effectively ordered the SEC to proceed with approval if all requirements and laws are met.\n\nMany believe that the SEC now has its back to the wall, with JPMorgan, for example, arguing that the agency will probably have no choice but to approve many of the applications.\n\nIndeed, the court\u2019s ruling explicitly rules out that the reasons given by the SEC so far should be considered sufficient for a rejection, and states that the SEC\u2019s stance is arbitrary and therefore implicitly unfair.\n\nIn truth, however, there is nothing to suggest that the SEC will not do as it has always done and take its time, delaying the decision as long as possible, as it did on Friday.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan\u2019s analysts say that the delay is likely to indicate that the SEC will approve several applications at the same time, in order to avoid first-mover advantages.\n\nOnce the agency is forced to make a decision, it is expected to opt for bulk approval.\n\nThe inflow of capital: the arrival of bitcoin ETFs after Grayscale\u2019s victory\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs have one feature that makes them extremely attractive to the market.\n\nAs they are backed directly by BTC, they require the physical delivery of an amount of BTC equal to the value of the shares issued.\n\nThese BTCs have to be bought on the market, so the more shares they sell, the more Bitcoin they have to buy on the market to immobilise.\n\nThis should reduce the supply on the market and probably increase the price.\n\nAccording to Anthony Pompliano, the capital inflow into the spot bitcoin ETFs can be estimated at two billion dollars, which would mean a withdrawal of up to 77,000 bitcoins from the market.\n\nPomp on CNBC: A #Bitcoin ETF will be approved in the US. It will lead to billions of dollars of inflows.\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/crUnQEsNNE \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 2, 2023\n\nWhile it is not possible to calculate exactly what impact such inflows could have on the price of BTC, it is possible that at a time like this the impact could be significant.\n\nThe shortage of supply\n\nWe are in a very strange moment.\n\nThe amount of BTC on exchanges is at its lowest level in years, partly because after the various failures of 2022, many holders realised that it would be better not to leave bitcoin on exchanges.\n\nFurthermore, exchange volumes are also very low, and these two things together mean that even a not particularly large inflow of capital can be enough to upset the precarious balance between supply and demand very quickly.\n\nThis means that a significant inflow of capital could significantly increase demand, which is currently very low, and thus put pressure on prices.\n\nHowever, there is no certainty about the timing, not least because the two billion that Pompliano refers to would not come in all at once once the ETFs are approved.\n\nThe halving of bitcoin\n\nAdd to this the fact that in April next year, less than eight months away, there will be the fourth halving of Bitcoin, which in turn is expected to reduce the supply of BTC on the market, as it will halve the miners\u2019 revenues in one fell swoop.\n\nIf the ETFs are expected to be approved by February or March 2024 at the latest, they will actually be approved just before the halving. So the $2 billion of inflows they could attract could come at the same time as the halving, or in the months immediately after.\n\nHistorically, a bull run has started a few months after the halving.\n\nThe first halving occurred in September 2012, and the bull run started in early 2013.\n\nThe second halving occurred in July 2016, and the bull run began in early 2017.\n\nThe third halving occurred in May 2020 and the bull run began in November of that year.\n\nAlthough historical data is by no means sufficient to predict the future, it is possible that a similar scenario could trigger a new bull run in 2024 if the past repeats itself.\n\nHowever, it is not known whether the market value of bitcoin will have remained stable or fallen in the meantime."
