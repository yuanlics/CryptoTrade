        "title": "Lost Passwords Lock Millionaires Out of Their Bitcoin Fortunes (Published 2021) - The New York Times",
        "content": "Stefan Thomas, a German-born programmer living in San Francisco, has two guesses left to figure out a password that is worth, as of this week, about $220 million.\n\nThe password will let him unlock a small hard drive, known as an IronKey, which contains the private keys to a digital wallet that holds 7,002 Bitcoin. While the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply on Monday, it is still up more than 50 percent from just a month ago, when it passed its previous all-time high of around $20,000.\n\nThe problem is that Mr. Thomas years ago lost the paper where he wrote down the password for his IronKey, which gives users 10 guesses before it seizes up and encrypts its contents forever. He has since tried eight of his most commonly used password formulations \u2014 to no avail.\n\n\u201cI would just lay in bed and think about it,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cThen I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn\u2019t work, and I would be desperate again.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin is up 12% this month \u2014 even though barely anybody is trading it - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nAndriy Onufriyenko | Moment | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin has rallied sharply this month \u2014 but not for reasons you might think. The world's largest digital currency has risen more than 12% since the beginning of June. On Wednesday, its price topped $30,000 to hit its highest level since April 14, according to Coin Metrics data. Market players have attributed the jump to the news that U.S. asset management giant BlackRock had filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund tracking the market price of the underlying asset. While that may be part of the reason, the outsized moved can be put down to another factor beyond the news flow surrounding large institutions taking steps to embrace bitcoin or other digital assets.\n\nThin liquidity and big players\n\nCrypto \"market depth\" has been sitting at very low levels this year. Market depth refers to a market's ability to absorb relatively large buy and sell orders. When market depth is low and big players put in orders to buy or sell digital coins, prices can move in a big way up or down, even if the orders are not that huge. Market depth is a measure of liquidity in a market. According to data firm Kaiko, bitcoin's market depth has fallen 20% since the start of this year. Bitcoin has been one of the hardest-hit cryptocurrencies in terms of market depth, Kaiko said.\n\nThe market depth of bitcoin at a 1% range from the mid price has fallen about 20% since the start of the year, according to data firm Kaiko. Kaiko\n\n\"Bitcoin's recent surge in value has largely been driven by large trades within a less liquid market,\" Jamie Sly, head of research at CCData, told CNBC via email. \"Our analysis of market orders over 5 BTC reveals an aggressive surge in market buying, suggesting large players are seeking to gain exposure to digital assets.\" \"When combining large orders with thin books, the market is subject to more volatile movements,\" Sly added. That lack of liquidity has in part been driven by the regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry from U.S. authorities. The Securities and Exchange Commission has sued major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. Low liquidity, which has been a feature of the crypto market all year, is also partly behind bitcoin's 80% year-to-date rally.\n\nRetail traders aren't back \u2014 yet\n\nAnother notable feature of the current crypto market is the low volumes being traded on exchanges. Daily trading volume in the cryptocurrency currently sits at around $24 billion, according to crypto data website CoinGecko.\n\nThat's down markedly from the more than $100 billion of overall trading volume in bitcoin during the peak of the 2021 crypto rally, when bitcoin rose close to an all-time high of nearly $69,000. Large crypto investors usually hope that an early surge in prices will be enough to tempt retail investors back into participating in the rally which ultimately boosts prices for bitcoin and other digital coins. But that hasn't happened. \"What is notable about this rally is that trade volumes overall are at multi-year lows, and we are only seeing a slight increase, which even then is far lower than levels we saw from January to March,\" Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, told CNBC. \"I think trading volumes and price volatility are two of the most telling indicators of crypto market activity. Both volatility and volumes are at multi-year lows, and even a rapid increase in price is not enough to draw traders in.\"\n\n'It's not a market for ordinary clients'\n\nIn the last bitcoin cycle, market momentum was largely driven by big, institutional names as investment banks from Morgan Stanley to Goldman Sachs set up trading desks to give their clients exposure to the digital currency. However, the market really started to break out only when retail traders started to take notice \u2014 in early 2021, people became tempted by the phenomenon that was NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and other more speculative bets. Later that year, the cryptocurrency market experienced a seismic rally, with the price of bitcoin zooming to unprecedented levels. That was in tandem with surging trading volume, which climbed from $21.2 billion at the start of 2020 to $105.4 billion on Nov. 9, 2021, when bitcoin hits its all-time high, according to CoinGecko. Today, trading volume is nowhere near where it was at the height of the 2021 crypto boom. \"Any bit of news, if it's good, then the professional traders trade \u2014 otherwise, they're not trading,\" Carol Alexander, a professor of finance at the University of Sussex, told CNBC. \"If a bit of good news like the bitcoin ETF comes, they fire the cannons upwards.\" BlackRock's ETF filing was followed by similar move from Invesco and WisdomTree, which also filed for their own respective bitcoin-related products.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Bitcoin and ether are both being manipulated in this way by the professional traders. They don't trade most of the time, they wait until there's a bit of good news,\" Alexander said. \"Then they'll sell the top and you've got a sideways market.\" Indeed, bitcoin has traded within a range this year, and attempts to burst significantly higher have been thwarted. Alexander thinks bitcoin is likely to trade within a range of between $25,000 and $30,000 for the remainder of the summer. She expects, however, that toward the end of the year, the cryptocurrency will climb toward $50,000, citing attempts from larger market players to prop up the market, with big purchases making outsized moves. \"It's not a market for ordinary clients. It's really is not,\" she warned.\n\nHas the market bottomed?\n\nVijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets at the Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX, told CNBC he suspects the latest run-up in bitcoin's price is being driven more by \"long term institutional buyers.\" Big funds and crypto-focused hedge funds are among the market participants driving the action, Ayyar added. \"I don't think this is as much of a retail push, since retail was quite flushed out during the recent pullback,\" he said. Several crypto industry insiders have expressed hopes that the market is nearing a \"bottoming\" period where it can start to rise again. The recent price action echoes activity in 2018, when both bitcoin's price and volumes were subdued for several months before beginning to rise again the following year. However, CCData's Sly said it is \"still too early to say whether the worst is over for bitcoin.\" \"The recent wave of interest from traditional financial institutions, like Blackrock, Citadel [Securities], and Fidelity instils a renewed optimism in the market,\" he said. \"Provided the wider macro environment and equity markets continue to be favorable, it is possible that bitcoin could maintain its current positive price trajectory.\" WATCH: Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king?\n\nwatch now"

It is scheduled to launch on the Chicago Board Options BZX Exchange on 27 June, 2023.\n\nThe fund looks for investment returns that are equivalent to double the return of the CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index. Investors can purchase shares of an ETF, which bundles securities like equities and commodities, to receive exposure to those securities without actually owning them.\n\nThere are two main types of Bitcoin ETFs: Bitcoin futures and Bitcoin spot. BITX will be a leveraged ETF, using Bitcoin futures as leverage to amplify the returns of a benchmark index. The news was largely applauded by proponents of cryptocurrencies, but others wondered why a simple spot ETF launched before a 2X leveraged futures offering. The BITX fund was approved by the SEC as large traditional financial institutions look to enter the cryptocurrency market recently."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\n\u2018The Great Accumulation\u2019 of Bitcoin has begun, says Gemini\u2019s Winklevoss\n\nRecently renewed optimism for an approved Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) is igniting \u201cThe Great Accumulation Race\u201d for Bitcoin, according to industry pundits. Over the past week, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree and Valkyrie have followed investment giant BlackRock in applying for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the United States Securities Exchange Commission, which some analysts believe is the reason for Bitcoin\u2019s price surge in the past days.\n\nBinance.US solves USD withdrawal issues but warns it won\u2019t last long\n\nCrypto exchange Binance.US informed customers that it has resolved U.S. dollar withdrawal issues after working with its banking partners, though it warned the relief may not last. The exchange suspended dollar deposits and notified its customers of an incoming pause to fiat withdrawal channels on June 9, amid its ongoing battle with the SEC. Binance.US has encouraged customers that have a failed withdrawal attempt to resubmit their requests. Any remaining USD balances held in customer accounts will be converted into Tether at a future date.\n\nAtomic Wallet users have been left wanting more answers, despite the decentralized wallet provider finally releasing a full \u201cevent statement\u201d about the June exploit \u2014 which some estimate has run up to $100 million in losses. In the statement, Atomic didn\u2019t point to what exactly led to the exploit, only laying out the four most \u201cprobable\u201d causes, including a virus on user devices, an infrastructure breach, a man-in-the-middle attack or malware code injection. According to the company, \u201cless than 0.1%\u201d of app users were affected, but the figure is still rebuffed by many online.\n\nUK government moves forward on financial markets bill for potential regulation of crypto\n\nLawmakers in the United Kingdom are moving forward with legislation that could help support the adoption of crypto in the country. First introduced to the U.K. Parliament in July 2022, the Financial Services and Markets Bill was aimed at ensuring the country maintained its place in the financial world following Brexit, including granting authority on digital asset regulation. The bill went through a third reading in the House of Lords, one of the final stages in passage before considering any additional amendments and being signed into law.\n\nFed sees stablecoin as form of money, wants \u2018robust\u2019 role in its oversight, Powell says\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve Board sees payment stablecoins as a form of money, Chair Jerome Powell said on June 21 when addressing Congress about the proposed stablecoin bill. Powell took a position that runs contrary to that of SEC chairman Gary Gensler. Last year, Gensler spoke at a Senate Banking Committee hearing saying that stablecoins may require registration and regulation with the SEC. Gensler has also consistently stated that all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin, are securities.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $30,697, Ether (ETH) at $1,896 and XRP at $0.49.

In a Twitter update on June 22, pseudonymous trader Credible Crypto argued that the next four months should deliver the bullish BTC price momentum needed to tackle $69,000.\n\n\u201cWhats clear with any parabolic advance is that momentum increases exponentially and peaks at the top. We can see this in both prior impulsive moves from 3k-14k and from 10k-60k,\u201d he explained. This time around, Bitcoin has delivered a successful retest of support on monthly timeframes, with $25,000 now possibly a springboard for a new \u201cparabolic advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would expect that once expansion begins (which it looks like it has) we should see monthly moves of > 10k at a time, easily. From current levels to prior ATH is a $40,000 gap. This gap should then, logically, be covered within a few monthly candles if this is a parabolic advance,\u201d he said.\n\nFUD of the Week\n\nPrime Trust can\u2019t honor customer withdrawals, says Nevada regulator\n\nPrime Trust\u2019s financial condition is \u201ccritically deficient,\u201d and the crypto custodian has been unable to honor customer withdrawals since June 21, according to Nevada\u2019s business regulator. In a cease and desist order, the regulator claimed Prime Trust\u2019s is in an \u201cunsafe or unsound condition\u201d to continue business. The company now has 30 days to respond to the order and can request an administrative hearing to contest it. The move comes a few days after its subsidiary, Banq, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States.\n\nApple removes malicious Trezor app from App Store\n\nAn apparent malicious app purporting to be crypto hardware wallet Trezor has been taken off Apple\u2019s App Store, though a quick search has revealed that other copycat apps are still lurking. After a Twitter user warned the tech company, the app was quickly removed. Fake wallet apps on Apple\u2019s App Store are nothing new. In 2021, one user reportedly lost $600,000 in Bitcoin after downloading a malicious Trezor app from the App Store.\n\nTwitter suspends memecoin-linked AI bot after Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018scam crypto\u2019 claim\n\nTwitter has suspended the account of the popular memecoin-linked, AI-powered bot \u201cExplain This Bob\u201d after Elon Musk alleged it was a \u201cscam crypto account.\u201d The bot was created by Prabhu Biswal from India and used OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model to comprehend and provide responses to tweets by those who tagged the account. It amassed over 400,000 followers before the suspension. The project was also linked to the ERC-20 memecoin Bob Token (BOB), which was launched in April.

        "title": "Trendy Brooklyn bathhouse powered by Bitcoin mining draws heated response - New York Post",
        "content": "A trendy Brooklyn bathhouse picked up steam this week when it boasted that it uses Bitcoin mining to generate heat for its pools.\n\n\u201cDid you know our pools are heated with byproduct from Bitcoin mining?\u201d Williamsburg\u2019s Bathhouse posted on Instagram, drawing hundreds more comments than usual.\n\nA video explains in a few steps how the futuristic process to mine the virtual currency goes down.\n\n\u201cStep one: mine Bitcoin. Mining uses electricity for computing power and generates heat as a byproduct,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nBitcoin mining involves solving complicated math problems with specialized software that verifies transactions in the currency, according to the financial services company Bankrate.\n\n\u201cStep two: send the heat generated by the miners to heat exchangers and heat our pools. Step three: enjoy hot pool while supporting the Bitcoin network,\u201d the video continues. \u201cThe pools absorb the heat and circulate cool liquid back to the miners.\u201d\n\nMining Bitcoin is energy-intensive and critics argue that it is bad for the environment.\n\n\u201cThis makes me like Bathhouse less,\u201d commented one user. \u201cNow I\u2019m concerned about who is mining this cryptocurrency, who is profiting from it, and whether I support that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t supporting that sh-t,\u201d said another.\n\nOthers applauded the innovation.\n\n\u201cThis is awesome,\u201d wrote one person. \u201cI pretty much never leave Manhattan but I just booked a massage.\u201d\n\n3 A Brooklyn spa announced on social media that it uses mining from cryptocurrency to hear its pools. Bathhouse/Instagram\n\n3 Pools at Bathhouse in Williamsburg are heated through cryptocurrency mining, the company shared. Bathhouse/Instagram\n\nThe company remains passionate about its business model.\n\n\u201cInstead of using electricity for an electric pool heater, we use electricity to run the miners,\u201d Bathhouse co-founder Jason Goodman told Yahoo\u2019s In The Know.\n\n\u201cThe net result is that we are essentially energy-neutral because we are powering the miners with energy we already needed to purchase to heat our pools,\u201d Goodman continued. \u201cTherefore, we are able to use this electricity \u2018twice\u2019 in a certain sense \u2026 We are able to recover a lot of our energy costs while supporting the Bitcoin network and nerding out on a fun engineering project.\u201d\n\n3 Critics say mining cryptocurrency has a negative toll on the environment. Bathhouse/Instagram\n\nThe company created a new Frequently Asked Questions section on its website to provide some more insight.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, if Bitcoin is able to have even a small percentage of positive impact that we think it might, it would be important to be open minded about it,\u201d Bathhouse explains.\n\nThe old factory-turned-massage-house opened in 2021 and features spa treatments such as massages as scrubs and has a restaurant and bar."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe recovery that began last week\u2014after U.S. inflation appeared to cool\u2014hit its stride this week as markets continued to reverberate from the bombshell of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filing an application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nDozens of companies apply for ETFs, and dozens have been rejected. To date, not a single Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved by the crypto-skeptic SEC, despite the fact that Canadian regulators have approved many of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stakes are high: a spot ETF would offer investors the chance to buy into Bitcoin and either ride the gravy train or go to hell in a hand basket, but if the latter, they\u2019ll be safe in the knowledge that their investment is protected, unlike those who purchase and store crypto directly.\n\nIf anybody has a chance of getting an ETF approved, it\u2019s BlackRock. The firm boasts an incredible $9 trillion in assets under management and has a winning score of 575-1 when it comes to getting an ETF approved by the SEC.\n\nThe news inspired two more U.S. asset managers, WisdomTree and Invesco, which have both previously applied for their own ETFs\u2014to file fresh ETF applications this week. Valkyrie followed suit shortly after.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETC) both surged this week. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency shot up 18% to its current price of $30,687, while the biggest runner up rallied 12.7% to trade at $1,893 at the start of the weekend.\n\nInvestors flooded into other cryptocurrencies this week as well. In fact, most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market cap shot up by double-digit percentages. There were no losses among the major unbacked coins.\n\nBitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ballooned a staggering 80.5% over the last seven days and currently trades for $192.90.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegulation and expansion\n\nWhile all eyes were on the SEC and big asset managers this week, there were a couple of other stories that indicated the steady adoption of crypto is continuing around the world.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) trial project backed by the Bank of England published its findings, concluding that a centrally-issued sterling-pegged digital currency could \u201cenable a robust ecosystem to foster innovation, and to help meet the future needs of a more digitalised society.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2014dubbed Project Rosalind\u2014emphasized the programmability of crypto through smart contracts, which facilitate automatic payments and enable new kinds of online transactions.\n\nOn Monday, British parliamentarians in the House of Lords (upper chamber) voted through the Financial Services and Markets Bill, a piece of legislation that proposes regulation for stablecoins, crypto and crypto promotion.\n\nThe bill has already passed the House of Commons and has made it through to the final stages: the Consideration of Amendments, where both chambers debate the proposals and tighten the screws until they both agree. The final stage requires a signature from King Charlie himself.\n\nIt was reported on Tuesday that Germany\u2019s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, applied for a digital asset custody platform license with the German finance regulator, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\n\nDuring a semiannual hearing on monetary policy held by the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee and led by Patrick McHenry (R-NC) on Wednesday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank should play a \u201crobust federal role\u201d in crypto regulation and added that Bitcoin has \u201cstaying power\u201d while implying the same about stablecoins.\n\nFinally, XRP progenitor Ripple was granted an in-principle payments license in Singapore. Ripple has long felt heat from U.S. regulators. A lawsuit against it by the SEC has been ongoing since 2020 and, like Coinbase, the company is now hedging its bets through global expansion.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Will Change Cryptocurrency Forever - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "This is wild! 6 Bitcoin ETF applications in 6 days! Bitcoin & altcoins cannot stop pumping. All of these Bitcoin ETF filings are very exciting but keep in mind that none have been approved yet. But they indeed have triggered a price rally.\n\nIs this the next big BTC bull run we all have been eagerly waiting for? Will altcoins suffer if the BTC ETF is approved? And a hunch. Could Bitcoin ETF Ruin Bitcoin? Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nBitcoin ETF & Why Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF creates a simple, legally compliant way to trade the price of Bitcoin. On Oct. 19th, 2021, marked the launch of the first U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF. And as expected, it was a hit. Within 48 hours of its launch, BITO Bitcoin ETF Becomes Fastest ETF Ever To Hit $1 Billion AUM.\n\nBut its timing was worse, the Bitcoin market began a massive slide. And that was the end of the first ETF. In fact, the SEC has rejected dozens of Bitcoin ETF applications. Then why are 6 major financial players suddenly FOMOING on BTC ETFs?\n\nWell, the reason is BlackRock. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with over $9 Trillion in assets under management applied for the BTC ETF first time ever. A historical examination reveals intricate dynamics between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and BlackRock.\n\nSo, BlackRock has a 99.86% success rate getting ETFs approved. Out of 576 ETF applications 575 were approved. Only once had an ETF it proposed rejected by the SEC in 2014. Does that mean BlackRock BTC ETF will most likely get approved? Before I answer that. Only for those who don\u2019t understand ETF fully. Let me explain it simply:\n\nWhat is an ETF?\n\nAn ETF is an investment vehicle that is publicly traded, like a stock, but tracks the performance of an underlying asset, in the case of a Bitcoin ETF, the underlying asset would be BTC.\n\nA BTC ETF will provide investors with a way to gain exposure to the value of BTC without worrying about any legal complications.\n\nGet this, a Bitcoin ETF works in much the same way as any other ETF. Investors buy shares in the ETF through whatever brokerage they buy stocks from and can trade them the same way they\u2019d trade shares in Apple or Tesla. Bitcoin ETFs track the current price of Bitcoin and should act in lockstep with Bitcoin\u2019s price swings.\n\nWhat Is the Need for a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nSo, why wouldn\u2019t investors just buy Bitcoin? For most regular retail investors, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general still look risky.\n\nBesides having unclear regulations around them, owning Bitcoin requires keeping a Bitcoin wallet and trusting crypto exchanges, which are still uncharted territory for people unfamiliar with the space and require a certain level of self-education.\n\nHolding Bitcoin places the burden of security squarely on you, making you responsible for keeping your own private keys safe (unless you want to entrust them to the exchange). This may mean buying a hardware wallet to protect purchased Bitcoin or storing private keys in a secure manner. You\u2019d also have to work out how to file taxes for sales of Bitcoin that resulted in capital gains.\n\nWith a Bitcoin ETF, investors need not worry about private keys, storage, or security. They own shares in the ETF just like their shares of stock and can gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without having to go through the hoops of purchasing and holding crypto. And to put it plainly, that is an extremely appealing proposition for many regular folks\u2014as well as sophisticated institutional investors.\n\nBlackRock \u2013 First Bitcoin SPOT ETF\n\nThe $10 trillion asset management giant BlackRock filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin Spot ETF on Thursday. This would be the first Bitcoin spot ETF in the US, and it would allow investors to get exposure to Bitcoin without actually buying it.\n\nBlackRock is proposing to use two partners to hold the Bitcoin and cash for the ETF: Coinbase Custody and BNY Mellon. The custodial arm of Coinbase is the \u201cBitcoin Custodian\u201d and it will hold all the Bitcoin to back the ETF. The Bank of New York Mellon is the \u201cCash Custodian\u201d and it will hold the investors\u2019 cash.\n\nThe SEC has been hesitant to approve Bitcoin ETFs in the past, due to concerns about the ability of large whales to manipulate Bitcoin\u2019s price and market manipulation. However, BlackRock is addressing these concerns by proposing to only use the top Bitcoin exchanges and by entering into a surveillance-sharing agreement with Nasdaq.\n\nWhen Will the Bitcoin ETF Be Approved?\n\nThe SEC is expected to take several months to review the filing. So will the price continue to rally till then? I feel yes, we could see a slight upside movement as BlackRock Bitcoin spot ETF would be a major milestone for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nIt would make it easier for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin, and it could help to legitimize the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCan BlackRock Succeed?\n\nGrayscale\u2019s spot ETF proposal was rejected last year because it tried to form a surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME Bitcoin Futures market, which the SEC did not consider closely related enough to the spot Bitcoin market.\n\nGrayscale has since sued the SEC, and judges overseeing the case have expressed skepticism over the SEC\u2019s argument. So, Blackrock said it would determine the value of the Bitcoin in its trust each day with reference to the CF Benchmarks Index.\n\nThe Index tracks the price of Bitcoin across Coinbase, Bitstamp, iBit, Kraken, Gemini, and LMAX Digital and strives for \u201cresistance to manipulation\u201d while not including \u201cany futures prices in its methodology.\u201d\n\nMany hedge funds and other investment firms have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Bitcoin ETFs in the past week\u2014 We\u2019ve seen 6 Bitcoin ETF applications in 6 days!\n\nBlackrock\n\nFidelity\n\nInvesco\n\nWisdom Tree\n\nValkyrie\n\nBitstamp\n\nThe SEC is facing a fresh wave of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from major investment firms, in the wake of BlackRock\u2019s filing:\n\nWisdomTree \u2013 ETF provider WisdomTree re-submitted an application requesting regulatory approval for the launch of the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust on Tuesday, June 20. The watchdog has previously rejected WisdomTree\u2019s attempt to release a BTC ETF, citing possible risks for consumers, such as fraud and market manipulation. Invesco \u2013 Eric Balchunas announced on his Twitter account that Invesco has renewed its efforts to launch a Bitcoin ETF in the United States. The company\u2019s first filing was in 2021 when it partnered with Galaxy Digital.\n\nInvesco was initially interested in launching a Bitcoin Futures ETF; however, it abandoned those plans at the end of 2021. Instead, it is focusing on a product that enables customers to invest in the primary cryptocurrency based on its actual market price.\n\n3. Valkyrie Financial \u2013 This services firm updated its filing for the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund on Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a fresh prospectus reflecting today\u2019s dominant crypto narrative.\n\n4. Fidelity \u2013 They said to enter the Bitcoin (BTC) ETF space soon. Other than filing for an ETF, it is being said it can buy Grayscale Investments.\n\nReal Deal??\n\nWe\u2019ve been seeing continued outflows among exchange-traded products, mutual funds, and over-the-counter (OTC) trusts. This is because of the crackdown on crypto markets by high-profile SEC lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. It labeled a slew of altcoins securities. In total, investors have pulled $423 million from funds over the past nine weeks.\n\nPeople have been feeling out of the ordinary. This happened when one of the world\u2019s most prestigious financial institutions applies for a cryptocurrency investment product. It was during a tough regulatory crackdown.\n\nCoinShares attributed the comparative trickle of outflows to BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) gambit.\n\nSenior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said this on Twitter, defending the use of the \u201cETF\u201d label, saying It\u2019s the \u201creal deal\u201d. He also pointed out that BlackRock has a nearly undefeated record when it comes to the SEC. With 575 of its ETF applications being approved. In contrast, other Bitcoin ETF applicants over the years can\u2019t say the same.\n\nAsset managers VanEck, Ark Invest, and Bitwise have all been rejected by the regulator. The issue is so contentious, Grayscale Investments even sued the SEC after it was rejected for converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. BlackRock is a serious institution and New York Mellon would be the custodian for the Trust\u2019s cash holdings\u2014another reputable financial institution. The current regulatory environment may prove difficult to manage an ETF, but the Wall Street giant doesn\u2019t just play around and certainly has the best odds yet.\n\nImpacts of Bitcoin\u2019s ETF\n\na) Price Action of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin market dominance has reached 50% for the first time in two years due to BlackRock\u2019s filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nBitcoin climbed to $30,000 for the first time since April, buoyed by The BlackRock announcement on a Bitcoin ETF and EDX Markets. The rally is backed by institutional demand!\n\nBlackRock\u2019s ETF is expected to be around $5 billion. This is certainly going to be the world\u2019s most anticipated ETF ever.\n\nPotential Impacts of Bitcoin\u2019s ETF\n\nBitcoin market dominance: The launch of the BlackRock ETF could lead to Bitcoin increasing its market dominance further. As more institutional investors gain exposure to cryptocurrency. This is because the ETF will make it easier for institutional investors to buy and sell Bitcoin, which could increase demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nHalving: The launch of the ETF could also coincide with the Bitcoin halving. Which is an event that occurs every four years when the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin is halved. This could lead to a further increase in the price of Bitcoin, as the halving will reduce the supply of new Bitcoin that is being mined.\n\nCan Really Drive up Institutional Adoption: Approval of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF could increase institutional adoption, providing a regulated and secure avenue for investors to access Bitcoin.\n\nGBTC Sees Over 400% Surge in Trading Volume\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is currently enjoying some attention from investors, and its trading volume is a testament to this fact. This follows after GBTC\u2019s trading volume spiked by over 400% within the last week.\n\nAs of June 14, the daily trading volume of GBTC was still standing at $16.1 million. But within just 5 days, following the BlackRock filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, that volume surged massively to about $80 million.\n\nIn this case, Grayscale itself can be optimistic about its proposal to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF. Although Grayscale, like many others, has had its proposal rejected by the SEC up until this moment.\n\nPlus there have been rumors earlier this week that claims Fidelity might be planning to acquire Grayscale. If that also turns out to be true, then that helps GBTC\u2019s cause with the SEC, especially with regard to Fidelity\u2019s repute as an old, traditional firm.\n\nWhatever might be the case, there is a general sense of optimism around BlackRock being successful in its bid for a spot in Bitcoin ETF. And when that happens, it is expected to pave the way for Grayscale to get its non-redeemable trust shares changed, too.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "Elevate Your Tech Prowess with High-Value Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Professional Certificate in Product Management Visit MIT MIT Technology Leadership and Innovation Visit Indian School of Business ISB Product Management Visit\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a more than one-year high on Friday, capping a week of gains helped in part by BlackRock's plans to create a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) despite heightened U.S. regulatory scrutiny on the digital asset sector.BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, filed last week to launch iShares Bitcoin Trust, an ETF that would have Coinbase Custody as its custodian as well as offer institutional investors exposure to the cyptocurrency. Crypto exchange EDX Markets, backed by investment firms Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Citadel Securities, also announced earlier this week that it will allow trading on some cryptocurrencies.The moves have revived investor interest in cyptocurrencies, which have been in the doldrums after a series of crypto company meltdowns including the sudden collapse of exchange FTX late last year.Compounding negative sentiment has been increased regulatory scrutiny, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's move this month to sue crypto giants Coinbase Global and Binance, alleging violation of its rules. The pair deny the allegations.Bitcoin has gained nearly 25% in value since BlackRock's filing. It rose as high as $31,458 on Friday, the highest level since June 7, 2022, and was last up 3.29% at $30,872.\"The dark clouds overshadowing crypto have lifted in recent days amid a burst of institutional interest,\" said Kate Laurence, general partner of Bloccelerate VC, which invests in crypto projects.\"The likes of BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Citadel throwing their hats into the crypto ring is hugely significant because it shows that institutions are very serious about the space - despite the recent regulatory crackdown.\"Investors piled into cryptocurrencies when interest rates were low, pushing the market to a peak value of $3 trillion in 2021. But they turned cautious as rates rose, with the value of the market now standing at around $1.24 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, has risen more than 16% since last week. It was up 1.63% at 1,903.20 on Friday.Some market-watchers said the SEC crackdown may be good for bitcoin, which is generally considered a commodity rather than a security, and therefore beyond the SEC's remit.\"The SEC lawsuit has created opportunities for robust, regulated players, so I'm cautiously optimistic that this BlackRock event will have some sustainability,\" said Doug Schwenk, CEO of Digital Asset Research."

Trump\u2019s account. Mr. Dorsey wondered aloud if the solution to that power imbalance was new technology inspired by the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\nWhen YouTube and Facebook barred tens of thousands of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters and white supremacists this month, many flocked to alternative apps such as LBRY, Minds and Sessions. What those sites had in common was that they were also inspired by the design of Bitcoin.\n\nThe twin developments were part of a growing movement by technologists, investors and everyday users to replace some of the internet\u2019s fundamental building blocks in ways that would be harder for tech giants like Facebook and Google to control.\n\nTo do so, they are increasingly focused on new technological ideas introduced by Bitcoin, which was built atop an online network designed, at the most basic level, to decentralize power."

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped but held above the US$30,000 threshold on Monday morning in Asia, with nearly all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies rising. The gains follow a number of traditional financial institutions showing interest in launching crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the U.S. securities regulator approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs in the country on Friday. In the NFT market, a whale has been selling off Bored Ape Yacht Clubs.\n\nBitcoin little changed\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.35% to US$30,444 over the last 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Beside Bitcoin, Litecoin was the only token on the list edging lower, dropping 1.48% over the past 24 hours but up 14.24% for the week.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the nation\u2019s first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF offered by Florida-based Volatility Shares, CoinDesk reported. The \u201c2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF\u201d is set to start trading on June 27 on CBOE BZX Exchange, according to the fund\u2019s website.\n\nThe ETF will not invest directly in Bitcoin but seek to benefit from increases in the price of Bitcoin futures contracts for a single day, according to its prospectus. The fund will correspond to two times the return of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll index.\n\nThis comes after BlackRock and WisdomTree recently filed applications with the SEC to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. The regulator has given a greenlight to a number of futures-based crypto ETFs but has not approved spot products.\n\n\u201cThe turbulences of 2022 have led to a decline in confidence in crypto-native institutions, presenting traditional financial institutions with a prime opportunity to enter the crypto market,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, New York-headquartered investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. launched euro-denominated transactions on its blockchain-based payment system, JPM Coin, Bloomberg reported on Friday.\n\nJPM Coin allows clients to transfer euros or dollars held with their JPMorgan accounts immediately and at any time of the day, unlike traditional banking transactions that usually operate during business hours.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club dump\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.25% to 2,905.28 in the 24 hours to 9:40 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index, however, is up 1.08% for the week.\n\nNFT transactions on Ethereum fell 2.49% over the past 24 hours to US$18.38 million, while transactions on the Bitcoin network surged 138% to US$3.6 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201cEthereum is still struggling with tumbling prices, especially in Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) whose average sales price remains in the low- to mid-US$70,000 range,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nOver the past few days, NFT whale Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi, has dumped dozens of his BAYC holdings. On Saturday, Machi sold 19 BAYC NFTs in one transaction on marketplace Blur for 651.56 Ether, or roughly US$1.22 million.\n\nThe floor price of BAYC stood at 37.4 Ether on Blur on Monday morning in Asia, gaining 4.18% over the past day but losing 13.52% over the past week.\n\nSales of BAYC jumped 26.11% over the past 24 hours to US$3.43 million, adding to weekly sales of US$13.11 million. BAYC was the most-sold collection for the past day and week in terms of transaction value.\n\nEthereum-based Azuki NFT transactions rose 25.68% in the past 24 hours to US$3.07 million, the highest after BAYC.\n\nAzuki\u2019s floor price on Blur rose 1.78% in the past day but was down 9.21% for the week.\n\nU.S. stock futures rise\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin. Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 10:40 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.19%, and S&P 500 futures added 0.24%. Nasdaq Futures rose 0.32%.\n\nEquity markets across Asia were mostly mixed with investors unsettled by events in Russia over the weekend when Wagner Group mercenaries marched toward Moscow in what appeared to be a rebellion against the military leadership.\n\nThe group later halted the advance, but it raised concern about instability in Russia as it may undermine the leadership of President Vladimir Putin. Oil prices rose on concern about supply disruptions from Russia, the world\u2019s third-largest producer of crude oil.\n\nIn macroeconomic developments, Japan\u2019s services producer price index rose 1.6% year-on-year in May, according to official data released Monday.\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s economy, despite being affected by factors such as past high commodity prices, has picked up as private consumption, for example, has increased moderately,\u201d the Bank of Japan said Monday in the summary of opinions of June 15-16 monetary policy meetings.\n\nOn U.S. inflation and interest rates, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank is in consensus on the need for more interest rate hikes this year.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, and a 28.1% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged at the next meeting on July 26.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "content": "For many crypto investors, this week felt like the beginning of a new era \u2013 and ironically, it was driven by the old guard of financial institutions. Bitcoin ended the week up 17.1% at $30,864.67, according to Coin Metrics, for its best week since March 17. At one point on Friday, bitcoin rose to as much as $31,412.72 , its highest level since June 8, 2022. In altcoins: the tokens tied to Solana and Cardano gained roughly 12% this week, while Polygon advanced more than 13%, as of Friday evening. These are the same tokens that were under pressure earlier this month after the Securities and Exchange Commission referred to them as crypto asset securities in lawsuits brought against the biggest exchanges \u2013 Binance and Coinbase . Meanwhile, each of the major averages posted their worst weekly performance since March. The S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell three our of four trading days this week, with the Nasdaq snapping an eight-week winning streak. \"Amid strengthening regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, bitcoin was hoisted above $30k as a number of TradFi [traditional finance] players have followed BlackRock's move to file for spot bitcoin exchange traded funds this week,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank. BlackRock filed an application for its spot bitcoin ETF June 15, spurring a flurry of fund filings from other asset managers. In this holiday-shortened week alone, institutions like WisdomTree and Invesco have filed or refreshed bitcoin ETF applications . BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin this week Meanwhile, an institutional-only crypto exchange called EDX Markets, backed by Fidelity Digital Assets, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities, announced that it has gone live with bitcoin and ether trading. And finally, JPMorgan confirmed to CNBC's \"Crypto World\" that it began allowing euro-denominated payments for corporate clients to make wholesale payments using its JPM Coin . This week's price action brings bitcoin's year-to-date gains to about 85% and advanced the cryptocurrency nearly 8% for the quarter, as of Friday evening. Still, for crypto, the period since the end of this year's banking crisis has been marked by low trading volume, even as it's moved in a positive direction recently. In the past two weeks, bitcoin's trading volume has increased 0.5% on a week-over-week basis, according to JPMorgan. That contrast could mean bitcoin hasn't attracted new money or investors into the crypto market, according to Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer. With a lot of good priced in this week, don't be surprised to see a minor pullback in the week ahead, Lau said. There isn't much on the calendar in the coming days, and investors \"may just sell the strength and wait for the next catalyst.\" From a technical point of view, Hasegawa said bitcoin's breakout \"from the two-month long descending channel is a bullish sign, especially since bitcoin's trading volume has noticeably increased, but from a macro perspective, a continued cash inflow may not be likely.\" \"Bitcoin may be able to print another leg up to around $32,000 in the short term due to technical reasons, but it feels like the current recovery has a short expiration date,\" he added."

        "title": "Crypto has a new rescuer: Wall Street - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Some of the biggest names in finance are making new bets on cryptocurrencies, adding competition and momentum to an upstart industry that is under increasing pressure from US regulators.\n\nThe world's largest money manager, BlackRock (BLK), wants to start a new exchange-traded fund that would use bitcoin as an underlying asset.\n\nTwo other sizable money managers, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab (SCHW), are backing a new cryptocurrency exchange with Citadel Securities.\n\nAnd one of the world's biggest lenders, Deutsche Bank, wants to operate a crypto custody business that would hold digital assets for its clients.\n\nThese endorsements from institutions that have a track record on Wall Street are helping to push the value of cryptocurrencies higher, especially bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest price in a year on Friday, to $31,389, after climbing above $30,000 for the first time since April. Through Friday bitcoin had risen 81% year to date.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies also surged this week, including ether (ETH-USD) and Avalanche's AVAX (AVAX-USD) token.\n\nThe total market capitalization for crypto assets reached $1.2 trillion on Friday, 14% higher than where it stood a week earlier.\n\nRising peril\n\nThis new interest from mainstream financial institutions comes at a time of rising peril for an industry that struggled to regain its footing following the 2022 implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the regulatory crackdown that followed.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month filed lawsuits against the biggest crypto exchanges in the US and the world, Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, alleging they both allowed digital currencies to trade on their platforms that should have been registered with the agency.\n\nThat stoked new concerns that it could become more difficult to trade certain digital assets. Since the beginning of 2023 the SEC has charged 15 different crypto actors with violating securities laws.\n\nStory continues\n\nA surprise turnaround in sentiment about the industry started June 15, when BlackRock, which controls more than $9 trillion in assets, filed paperwork with the SEC to create a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nSuch a fund would be tagged to the value of the original digital asset instead of merely tracking bitcoin futures. Coinbase would be the custodian for the bitcoin holdings.\n\n\"I think there's an element of \u2014 we need institutional custodians to step in and play roles and participate in digital token economies,\" BlackRock\u2019s head of strategic partnerships Joseph Chalom said Thursday at the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit in partnership with the FT.\n\nThe value of bitcoin soared on the announcement. Other institutional players such as Invesco and Wisdom Tree Investments quickly followed by renewing spot bitcoin ETF applications they had previously submitted to regulators.\n\nThe efforts still face a significant hurdle. The SEC has denied 27 prior applications to create spot bitcoin ETFs since 2013, arguing the products are vulnerable to market manipulation.\n\nWisdom Tree, in fact, was turned away in 2021. One asset manager, Grayscale Investments, is suing the SEC because it wasn't allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin offering.\n\n'Conflicts of interest'\n\nAnother catalyst for the industry came this week when a new cryptocurrency exchange that has backing from Citadel, Fidelity and Charles Schwab said it had begun executing trades.\n\nThe venture, EDX Markets, began discussing its plans in late 2022 and touting itself as an operation that would \"remove significant conflicts of interest that affect existing cryptocurrency exchanges.\"\n\nIt made the same point again last week, citing a \"non-custodial model designed to mitigate conflicts of interest.\" It won't handle digital assets owned by customers, instead running a marketplace where buyers and sellers deal with each other directly.\n\nAs part of FTX's collapse last year it was revealed that an affiliated trading firm used customer assets to make its own trades. The SEC has also alleged that Binance misused customer funds, a charge Binance denies.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nEarlier this month SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a briefing with reporters that a standard business model for crypto exchanges is \"built on conflicts,\" \"limited disclosure\u201d and \u201cat times deception.\"\n\nJamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX, said in an interview that \"FTX just validated our business model.\" What EDC is doing, he added, is \"taking the best of the digital world, 24 by seven trading, many of the innovations of blockchain and combining it with the investor protections in traditional finance.\"\n\nEDX says it will offer trading in just four cryptocurrencies\u2014bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash. None of those assets have been deemed securities by the SEC, allowing EDX to potentially sidestep some of the problems encountered by Coinbase and Binance.\n\nTogether those exchanges allow the trading of 19 digital currencies that the SEC has labeled as securities, meaning they need to be registered with the agency. In total the agency has designated 55 cryptocurrencies as securities in various lawsuits, according to data compiled by Cryptorank.io.\n\nCoinbase is fighting the suit and denies the SEC's claims. On Thursday its CEO Brian Armstrong did not sound worried while speaking at a crypto conference in New York.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. (Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images) (Steven Ferdman via Getty Images)\n\nInstead he said in the next five to seven years the Coinbase platform could turn into a \"superapp' like WeChat, which is used in Asia for everything from messaging to banking to ordering food.\n\n\"Despite some negative rhetoric, headlines, this industry is moving forward,\" he said.\n\nRoger Bayston, head of digital assets for Franklin Templeton, said the scrutiny from regulators is necessary.\n\n\"\u200b\u200bAs much as it's been bumpy, regulatory clarity really is clearing the decks for the adoption of standards that will allow capital to flow,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "title": "US Treasury yields are rising \u2014 What does it mean for Bitcoin price? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "United States government bonds, or Treasurys, have a tremendous influence across all tradeable markets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). In that sense, risk calculation in finance is relative, so every loan, mortgage and even cryptocurrency derivatives depends on the cost of capital attributed to U.S. dollars.\n\nAssuming the worst-case scenario of the U.S. government eventually defaulting on its own debt, what happens to the families, businesses and countries holding those bonds? The lack of interest debt payments would likely cause a global shortage of U.S. dollars, triggering a cascading effect.\n\nBut, even if that scenario comes to fruition, history shows us that cryptocurrencies may work as a hedge during periods of uncertainty. For instance, Bitcoin vastly outperformed traditional wealth preservation assets during the U.S.-China trade war in May 2021. Bitcoin gained 47% between May 5 and May 31 of that year, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 8.7%.\n\nAs the general public owns over $29 trillion in the U.S. Treasury, they are deemed the lowest-risk financial product in existence. Still, the price for each of those government bonds, or the yield traded, will vary depending on the contract maturity. Assuming there\u2019s no counterparty risk for this asset class, the single most important pricing factor is the inflation expectation.\n\nLet\u2019s explore whether Bitcoin\u2019s and Ether\u2019s price will be impacted by the growing demand for U.S. Treasurys.\n\nHigher demand for government bonds leads to lower yields\n\nIf one believes that inflation will not be restrained anytime soon, this investor is likely to seek a higher yield when trading the Treasury. On the other hand, if the U.S. government is actively devaluing its currency or there\u2019s an expectation for additional inflation, investors will tend to seek refuge in U.S. Treasurys, causing lower yield.\n\nU.S. 5-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice how the five-year Treasury yield reached 4.05% on June 22, the highest level in more than three months. This movement happened while the U.S. Consumer Price Index for May came in at 4.0% on a year-on-year basis, the lowest growth of inflation since March 2021.\n\nA 4.05% yield indicates that investors are not expecting inflation to drop below the central bank's 2% target anytime soon, but it also shows confidence that the 9.1% peak CPI data from June 2022 is behind us. However, that\u2019s not how Treasury pricing works because investors are willing to forego rewards in exchange for the security of owning the lowest-risk asset.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields are a great tool for comparing other countries and corporate debt, but not in absolute terms. These government bonds will reflect inflation expectations, but they may be severely constrained if a global recession becomes more likely.\n\nU.S. 5-year government bond yield vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange). Source: TradingView\n\nThe typical inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the U.S. Treasury yield has been invalidated in the past 10 days, most likely because investors are desperately buying government bonds for their safety regardless of the yield being lower than inflation expectations.\n\nThe S&P 500 index, which measures the U.S. stock market, hit 4,430 on June 16, just 7.6% below its all-time high, which also explains the higher yields. While investors typically seek scarce and inflation protected assets ahead of turbulent times, their appetite for excessive equity valuations is limited.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price data suggests bulls will succeed in holding $30K as support this time\n\nRecession risks could have distorted the yield data\n\nThe only certain thing at the moment is that investors\u2019 expectations for a recession are becoming more evident. Aside from the Treasury\u2019s yield, the U.S. Conference Board\u2019s leading indicators declined for 14 consecutive months, as described by Charlie Bilello:\n\nThe Conference Board's Leading Economic Index declined in May for the 14th month in a row.\n\n\n\n\"We project that the US economy will contract over the Q3 2023 to Q1 2024 period. The recession likely will be due to continued tightness in monetary policy and lower government spending.\u201d\u2026 pic.twitter.com/wQfy8a3DVq \u2014 Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) June 23, 2023\n\nConsequently, those betting that Bitcoin\u2019s recent decoupling from the U.S. Treasury's yield inverse correlation will quickly revert might come out disappointed. Data confirms that government bond yields are higher than normal due to increased expectations of a recession and economic crisis ahead.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin hits highest in a year as crypto rebounds from scandals - The Times of India",
        "content": "Bitcoin hit its highest level in a year amid renewed fervor for digital assets despite a slew of challenges for the industry.The original digital currency crossed above $31,013, its 2023 peak, to reach its highest level since June 2022, Bloomberg data show. The surge brought Bitcoin to as high as $31,410 before the gain was pared. The token is up by almost 90% since the start of the year, though still more than 50% below an all-time high of almost $69,000.Other cryptocurrencies followed suit, with Ether also rallying.It\u2019s a remarkable development \u2014 and show of resiliency \u2014 for a market that many had written off as being on the verge of extinction following a number of high-profile and high-impact scams and company fallouts that left the industry besmirched among investors.\u201cFrom the ardent Bitcoiner\u2019s perspective, the token\u2019s most fundamental investment thesis is playing out: inflation, monetary mismanagement, banking crises, sovereign debt anxiety, US-dollar-reserve-status questions are all playing a role in giving Bitcoiners an \u2018I told you so\u2019 moment,\u201d said Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at FRNT Financial. \u201cI would not describe rallying to new all time highs despite the challenging environment, but rather because of it.\u201dMost recently, it\u2019s been news about BlackRock Inc \u2019s shock filing for a US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that\u2019s reignited fervor for crypto , with some in the market hoping that such a product \u2014 which currently doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 gets approval from regulators. An approval \u2014 whatever its odds \u2014 would mark a win for fans who have for years longed for such an investment product.\u201cBlackRock\u2019s filing is big news for Bitcoin due to its close ties with regulators and a very strong ETF-approval track record,\u201d wrote K33\u2019s Bendik Schei and Vetle Lunde. \u201cIt\u2019s also worth noting that BlackRock would not dedicate time and resources to this filing if they did not view the probability of long-term strength from BTC, and thus strong inflows, as substantially high.\u201dThey added: \u201cAn approval would profoundly impact the market structure of Bitcoin, as it would reduce the barriers for financial advisors to offer exposure to BTC through an accessible investment vehicle with daily creations and redemptions delivered by a trusted issuer.\u201dOther recent news also reinforced crypto believers\u2019 faith in the rally. A new crypto exchange backed by firms including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets and Charles Schwab Corp. \u2014 called EDX Markets \u2014 said it\u2019s gone live. And, among other pieces of news, JPMorgan Chase & Co expanded one of the most high-profile projects to bring blockchain technology to traditional banking, introducing euro-denominated payments for corporate clients using its JPM Coin.\u201cThe effects of the so-called \u2018crypto winter\u2019 seem less persistent today than a year ago, as various jurisdictions and institutional players continue to embrace crypto-related initiatives,\u201d David Duong, head of research at Coinbase, said in a recent note.On Twitter, where a lot of crypto discourse takes place, a number of users cited FOMO \u2014 or the fear of missing out \u2014 as part of the recent price surge, whereby some investors jump into the market because they are watching others reap the benefits of the rally and want to take part in it.But the fact that the industry is facing harsh regulatory oversight has not dissipated, despite all the renewed hype over prices surging.The SEC has set its sights on the crypto space following last year\u2019s numerous instances of scams and fallouts of once-vaunted companies, including FTX and a number of lenders. It\u2019s led to a mass exodus by retail investors in particular, who have collectively lost billions of dollars in the wake of the revelations and implosions.Trading volumes have dried up as a result. In May, the combined spot and derivatives trading volumes on centralized exchanges fell more than 15% to $2.4 trillion, according to CCData. Spot trading volumes alone dropped nearly 22% to $495 billion, notching the lowest monthly reading since March 2019, the researcher said in a report.\u201cGiven the thin liquidity and the relatively scant amount of BTC available to new entrants (no eager sellers at these levels), even a tiny uptick in large investor interest would be enough to move the price,\u201d said Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto Is Macro Now\u201d newsletter.Others point out that hype around a potential spot-Bitcoin ETF has come and gone in the past, without regulators ever approving such a product.\u201cPeople are speculating BlackRock\u2019s heft in the financial markets will help them get approval. I am not quite there yet,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. \u201cThe SEC has been aggressively cracking down on the crypto space, it seems a bit early for such an about-face.\u201d"

        "content": "In this article, we delve into the current market conditions and examine the possibility of Bitcoin finding support at $30,000. Alongside this analysis, we explore the emerging platform, Tradecurve, which has been showing a bullish trajectory during the ongoing presale event. Let\u2019s start with the current conditions in the market.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCan Bitcoin (BTC) Find Support at $26K\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing significant pressure following a series of regulatory announcements this week. Consequently, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has stabilized below the critical 200-week moving average, reflecting market uncertainty in the face of these regulatory developments.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) fell to a daily low of $30,000, which marked an increase of more than $1,200 from the previous day\u2019s high. The good news is that the price has since pumped back up to above $31k \u2014 but can Bitcoin (BTC) hold and find support at this level?\n\nEven though Bitcoin (BTC) has demonstrated a certain degree of vulnerability, it hasn\u2019t been hit as hard as some major alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). This divergence can be attributed to the heavy impact on altcoins following the delisting that occurred in response to legal action taken by U.S. regulators against significant cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAs of now, the 200-week MA for Bitcoin is at approximately $31,185.77. If Bitcoin (BTC) fails to maintain this level, it could suggest a bear market for the entire crypto space. This shows the importance of Bitcoin (BTC) holding steady above $30K.\n\nWhile the SEC investigation is bad news for the crypto space and proof-of-stake coins, Bitcoin (BTC) is a different beast altogether. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin (BTC) means that no single entity can influence the market.\n\nBullish analysts note that Bitcoin (BTC) is above a number of support zones. Most notable is the $24K price level, which has acted as significant support and resistance since 2020.

        "title": "Bitcoin breaks above $30,000 after BlackRocks ETF news | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News ... - Guardian Nigeria",
        "content": "This week we have witnessed many exhilarating twists and turns in the cryptocurrency landscape. From Bitcoin\u2019s soaring highs spurred by BlackRock\u2019s ambitious venture into the crypto ETF realm to the SEC\u2019s hard-hitting scrutiny of crypto behemoths like Binance and Coinbase. We\u2019ll also shed light on the profound principles at the core of the crypto revolution \u2013 the need for self-custody and financial privacy. So, whether you\u2019re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or a curious newcomer, this exploration promises to unravel the complexities of this dynamic, ever-evolving digital asset world, reminding us why we got into this fascinating game in the first place.\n\nThis week Bitcoin, the reigning monarch of the crypto realm, scored a more than one-year high. Now, isn\u2019t that something to write home about? This dazzling climb rounded off a week of sprightly gains, credited, in part, to the charming BlackRock\u2019s scheme to roll out a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2013 right under the discerning gaze of U.S. regulators who seem to be developing a rather keen interest in the digital asset sector.\n\nBlackRock, the unrivalled titan of asset management, put forth paperwork last week to bring iShares Bitcoin Trust into existence. A shiny new ETF, with none other than Coinbase Custody as its custodian, handpicked to provide institutional investors with a taste of the tantalising world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEarlier this week, EDX Markets, a crypto exchange backed by formidable investment firms Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel Securities, declared it would enable trading on certain cryptocurrencies. While some might dub this the \u201cgame-changer,\u201d I like to think of it as a much-needed shot in the arm for cryptocurrencies, which were a tad under the weather following a string of distressing meltdowns from crypto firms \u2013 including the sudden, spectacular collapse of the exchange FTX late last year.\n\nDarkening the clouds, the digital currency market has been under the cosh of escalating regulatory scrutiny. Take, for instance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent salvo \u2013 lawsuits against the crypto titans Coinbase Global and Binance. The SEC charges them with breaking its rules, allegations that Coinbase and Binance fervently dispute.\n\nThe SEC goes after Binance and Coinbase\n\nJust as we were starting to get comfy, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with its now-famous penchant for spoiling the party, took aim at the pulsating heart of the cryptocurrency universe. What\u2019s that in their crosshairs, you ask? Why, the crypto exchange Binance and its ever-resilient founder, Changpeng Zhao.\n\nAccusing them of running a \u201cweb of deception,\u201d the SEC charged Zhao and his exchange with a baker\u2019s dozen of offences. Picture this: a classic game of cat and mouse, where the regulators, armed with their magnifying glasses, sniff out the discrepancies in the crypto wonderland.\n\nOne of the SEC\u2019s most scathing allegations is that Binance and Zhao never truly separated the US company from its US exchange spin-off. Binance.US, playing the innocent, claimed to have put up a digital wall, barring its customers from trading on Binance.com since 2019. But wait, the SEC has a twist in the tale \u2013 they allege that Binance and Zhao cleverly outwitted their own controls, enabling high-value US customers to continue trading on the Binance.com platform in secret.\n\nIt gets juicier. While Binance.US was donning the mask of an independent trading platform for US investors, the SEC claims Zhao was the puppeteer controlling this operation from behind the scenes. Among the \u2018forbidden fruits\u2019 offered to its US customers were commodity derivatives \u2013 essentially gambling chips for betting on cryptocurrency prices.\n\nIt\u2019s evident that the SEC has developed a taste for this crypto crackdown. Their resolve was only strengthened by the collapse of FTX last year, leading to charges against its founder. Now, even Coinbase has been dragged into the fray, accused of operating as an \u201cunregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency.\u201d\n\nAs we marvel at these unfolding events, one can\u2019t help but ask: does Blackrock\u2019s foray into the crypto arena have anything to do with this? A mere coincidence or something more, you decide.\n\nCore Values of Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe core ethos of cryptocurrency, if you will, revolves around the concept of not requiring intermediaries. This notion shines a spotlight on two critical practices for crypto users: self-custody and financial privacy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with self-custody. The term might seem to carry a degree of gravitas, and rightly so. It essentially means taking charge of one\u2019s crypto assets. Think of it as being your own bank, sans the brick-and-mortar facade. You\u2019re not entrusting your hard-earned digital assets to a third party. Instead, you\u2019re securing them in your personal wallet, with private keys only you control. This practice arms users with unprecedented control over their assets, a virtue that\u2019s both empowering and necessitates a heightened sense of responsibility. Moreover, it strengthens the overall integrity of the blockchain ecosystem by minimizing single points of failure \u2013 no centralized entities to fall victim to hackers or insolvency.\n\nThe second practice, financial privacy, is where platforms like Tornadocash.vn come into play. In the world where digital footprints are as revealing as physical ones, maintaining financial privacy is paramount. Tornado Cash, a non-custodial privacy solution on Ethereum, helps users achieve just that.\n\nOperating on a sophisticated principle of cryptographic anonymity, Tornado Cash obfuscates the on-chain link between source and destination addresses. When a user deposits coins into the Tornado Pool, the platform issues a proof, a cryptographic testament of the transaction. Later, a new, unrelated address can make a withdrawal using this proof, effectively breaking the link between the sender and receiver addresses. This mechanism ensures that your transactions remain anonymous and untraceable, providing a crucial layer of privacy in the otherwise transparent ecosystem of public blockchains.\n\nWhy is this necessary, you ask? Well, consider this. Blockchain\u2019s transparency, while an asset, can sometimes become a liability. Every transaction is recorded and can potentially be traced back to you, jeopardizing your financial privacy. Using Tornado Cash or similar platforms gives you an extra layer of privacy, allowing you to use your digital assets without leaving a trail of breadcrumbs.\n\nAs we delve deeper into the enigmatic world of cryptocurrencies, remember this \u2013 it\u2019s not just about riding the wave of price volatility. It\u2019s about embracing the transformative principles underpinning the technology: self-sovereignty, financial freedom, and privacy. After all, isn\u2019t that what the crypto revolution is all about?\n\n"

        "title": "ChatGPT gives 10 reasons why you should buy Bitcoin - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the dominant cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, has witnessed remarkable growth throughout the years, serving multiple purposes, including its role as an investment vehicle. Currently, advocates are pushing for its widespread adoption due to numerous compelling factors, resulting in its heightened global attention.\n\nIn light of this, Finbold sought insights from generative artificial intelligence tool (AI), ChatGPT, with the prompt \u2018Give me 10 reasons to buy Bitcoin\u2019. Below are the argument fronted by the tool;\n\n#1 Return Potential\n\nThe tool pointed out that throughout its existence, Bitcoin has witnessed remarkable price appreciation, captivating the attention of numerous investors enticed by its potential to deliver substantial returns on their investments. It is worth noting that the asset reached an all-time high of almost $69,000 in late 2021. The asset is currently attempting to exit last year\u2019s bear market, trading above $30,000.\n\n#2 Decentralization\n\nChatGPT acknowledged that Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization nature makes it appealing since the nature sets it apart from conventional financial systems governed by central authorities such as governments or banks.\n\n\u201cThis decentralized nature can appeal to those seeking financial independence and a system free from traditional institutions,\u201d the tool said.\n\n#3 Hedge against traditional financial systems\n\nThe AI tool stated that Bitcoin is widely regarded as a potential hedge against the vulnerabilities of the traditional financial system. Many astute investors perceive it as a means to safeguard their wealth from potential economic downturns, inflationary pressures, or the erosion of currency value.\n\nTherefore, by embracing Bitcoin, ChatGPT stated that these investors aim to fortify their financial positions and shield themselves from the uncertainties and risks associated with traditional monetary systems.\n\n#4 Limited supply\n\nOne of the compelling arguments was that Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply, set at a maximum of 21 million coins, serves as a reason to invest in this digital asset. According to the insights provided by the tool, the scarcity of Bitcoin has the potential to drive its value upward over time, particularly as demand continues to grow while the supply remains fixed.\n\nThis inherent ability of Bitcoin is seen as a solution to one of the inherent pitfalls of traditional financial systems, where the excessive printing of money can lead to the devaluation of the currency.\n\n#5 Store of value\n\nThroughout its evolution, Bitcoin has garnered comparisons to gold, earning the moniker \u201cdigital gold.\u201d This association has prompted ChatGPT to highlight it as a compelling reason to invest in the asset.\n\nThe finite supply and decentralized nature of Bitcoin make it highly appealing to individuals seeking an alternative asset class that possesses the potential to preserve its value over the long haul. By resembling gold in these aspects, Bitcoin offers investors the prospect of diversifying their portfolios with a digital asset that exhibits resilience and store-of-value characteristics.\n\n#6 Global accessibility\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, one reason to invest in Bitcoin is its global accessibility without the limitations imposed by geographical boundaries. This distinctive attribute facilitates seamless fund transfers and has the potential to unlock investment opportunities that extend beyond traditional markets.\n\nBy transcending the confines of geographical restrictions, Bitcoin offers investors the flexibility to participate in the digital economy and explore investment avenues previously inaccessible or constrained by conventional financial systems.\n\n#7 Increasing adoption\n\nThe tool pointed out that investors can put money in Bitcoin based on its growing adoption. The tool highlighted that Bitcoin had received recognition from various individuals, businesses, and institutions worldwide. In this case, ChatGPT pointed out that the growing acceptance and integration into mainstream finance may lead to increased liquidity and stability in the market.\n\n#8 Potential for financial inclusion\n\nAccording to the tool\u2019s insights, Bitcoin can potentially extend financial services to unbanked or underbanked individuals. By leveraging Bitcoin, these individuals can actively participate in the global economy, gain access to essential financial tools, and facilitate fund transfers more inclusively and efficiently. The efficiency offered by Bitcoin in this regard emerges as a compelling reason to consider investing in this digital asset.\n\n#9 Technological innovation\n\nThe underlying blockchain technology goes beyond cryptocurrency and holds transformative potential across diverse industries such as finance, supply chain management, and healthcare. The insights from ChatGPT emphasize that investing in Bitcoin can be driven by a desire to gain exposure to the revolutionary capabilities of blockchain technology.\n\n#10 Diversification\n\nThroughout its existence, Bitcoin has emerged as an investment product that has found its place in diverse portfolios. ChatGPT suggests including Bitcoin in an investment portfolio can offer valuable diversification benefits. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have demonstrated a relatively low correlation with traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds.\n\nThis implies that they may exhibit different behaviors in various market conditions. By incorporating Bitcoin into a well-diversified portfolio, there is a potential to reduce overall risk and enhance risk-adjusted returns by tapping into the unique characteristics and potential growth opportunities the cryptocurrency market presents.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin price hits 1-year high; Here's a buy zone if correction occurs - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged to over $31,400 on Friday, reaching its highest level since 2022, fueled by growing institutional interest in the maiden cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin briefly retracted, it has managed to maintain a trading value above $30,000 for the first time since April. This price level has proven to be a significant resistance point throughout 2023.\n\nHaving risen by over 85% in value this year, the recent rally faces uncertainties regarding the sustainability of its gains. The overall market grapples with regulatory concerns and macroeconomic factors contributing to the prevailing uncertainty.\n\nIn this line, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe expressed doubts about the cryptocurrency\u2019s ability to sustain its rally in a tweet on June 24. However, he noted that if Bitcoin experiences a minor correction to around $28,500, it will present an ideal opportunity to accumulate the asset.\n\n\u201cBitcoin made a nice high, through which it swept the yearly high. I\u2019m unsure whether we\u2019ll continue running from here, but during uptrends you\u2019ll most likely see price continuing to run rather than have deep corrections. If we have a correction, $28,500 I buy,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInstitutional interest boost Bitcoin\u2019s value\n\nThe current surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value can largely be attributed to the increasing interest from major financial institutions. Notably, BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the world\u2019s largest investment management company, recently applied to register a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nFurthermore, this week witnessed the launch of a digital asset trading platform by EDX Markets, a cryptocurrency exchange supported by renowned firms such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Citadel Securities.\n\nThese initiatives have instilled investor confidence in the crypto space, especially at a time when the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified its regulatory crackdown on crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase over the alleged listing of unregistered securities.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIn terms of Bitcoin\u2019s price analysis, as of now, it is comfortably trading above the resistance level of $30,000, with a valuation of $30,621. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin has experienced a growth of over 15%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin one-day technical analysis obtained from TradingView indicates a bullish trend. The gauges summarize a \u201cbuy\u201d sentiment at 14 while moving averages suggest a \u201cstrong buy\u201d at 13. Oscillators remain neutral, with a sentiment score of 8.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite its substantial growth this year, Bitcoin still trails behind its previous record high of over $60,000, achieved in 2021.\n\nThe cryptocurrency faced significant challenges last year due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s swift interest rate adjustments and the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. These events triggered a widespread sell-off in the crypto market, consequently impacting Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
