        "title": "BlackRock files to launch Bitcoin ETF with Coinbase and Nasdaq listed as partners - Fortune",
        "content": "In a potential game changer for crypto markets, asset management giant BlackRock is moving to launch an exchange-traded fund for Bitcoin. In an application filed on Thursday, the company sought permission to sell the currency through a vehicle called the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nThe move is significant because of BlackRock\u2019s enormous reach, and because it would allow retail investors to buy Bitcoin as shares of an ETF from an ordinary brokerage account. Likewise, it would make it easier for institutional investors, including pension funds, to hold the asset.\n\nThe ETF application states that Coinbase would be tasked with holding the trust\u2019s underlying Bitcoin as a custodian. It also states that Nasdaq would oversee the pricing data that informed the spot market price\u2014a potentially critical factor since the Securities and Exchange Commission has so far refused to permit a Bitcoin ETF, citing fears of market manipulation.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, which has been slumping in the face of regulatory pressures and hawkish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, jumped around 3% on news of the BlackRock application.\n\nWhile it has become increasingly easy to buy Bitcoin in recent years\u2014with everyone from Coinbase to PayPal to Robinhood offering it\u2014there is still no easy way to obtain it in the form of traditional shares. This has proved an impediment for large institutions, which are subject to bylaws that limit what sort of asset they may hold on behalf of their customers.\n\nCurrently, the most popular option to acquire Bitcoin in the form of shares is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which does not trade on a major stock exchange. The Grayscale trust also charges a management fee of around 2% a year, which is viewed as too high by many investors.\n\nBlackRock is hardly the first to seek to offer Bitcoin as an ETF, where fees are typically well under 0.5%. Grayscale and a number of funds have also sought permission, but have been denied by the SEC.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the BlackRock application, the company believes it will be able to succeed where other applicants have failed, in part because of its pedigree, but also because Nasdaq will be overseeing the pricing data\u2014a situation the person believes will ease concerns about the ETF manager manipulating the asset price on which the ETF is based.\n\nThe SEC last year finally granted permission for a crypto ETF, but only for futures markets\u2014a product that is significantly more complicated than a spot market ETF, and one that is more expensive for investors. Grayscale has sued the agency over this decision, saying it is arbitrary, and based on a recent federal court hearing, analysts have said the company has a good chance to prevail.\n\nThis story was updated with additional details."

        "content": "Asset management giant BlackRock took the first steps Thursday to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which has long been a point of contention between crypto advocates and federal regulators.\n\nThe firm filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust. If approved, the ETF would allow easy access for investors to get exposure to crypto in a product from one of Wall Street's largest companies.\n\n\"The Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in bitcoin rather than by acquiring, holding and trading bitcoin directly on a peer-to-peer or other basis or via a digital asset exchange,\" the filing said.\n\nThe SEC has so far resisted allowing the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The regulator is currently in a legal battle with Grayscale over whether the firm will be allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. A decision in that case is expected later this year.\n\nSeveral other firms have filed and later pulled applications to launch spot bitcoin funds. If the SEC relents, there could be a flood of those products on the market.\n\nETFs typically take months to launch after an initial filing, if they ever begin trading. The proposed BlackRock fund will likely face heavy resistance from the SEC, and the filing could be pulled before an ETF is ever launched, said Aisha Hunt, principal at asset management law firm Kelley Hunt & Charles.\n\nBlackRock's move comes during a time when crypto prices remain well below their all-time highs and the industry faces increasing scrutiny in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe SEC recently sued Coinbase and Binance for allegedly running unregistered securities exchanges. The SEC also accused Binance of commingling customer funds with its own.\n\nCoinbase is listed as the bitcoin custodian for the proposed BlackRock ETF. BlackRock has an existing strategic partnership with Coinbase. The companies announced last year that Aladdin, BlackRock's institutional investment platform, would be connected to Coinbase Prime for crypto trading and custody.\n\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the new filing.\n\nThe entrance of BlackRock into the bitcoin ETF space could be a boost to a sector that has had a rocky start over the past two years.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs first launched in 2021, but the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) is the only one that has grown to a substantial size, with about $800 million in assets. The fund has lost more than 40% on a total return basis since the launch, according to FactSet. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high shortly after BITO launched and is down more than 60% since its peak."

        "title": "Breaking Barriers: How Bitcoin is Creating Opportunities for Institutional Investors - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. The technology behind Bitcoin is known as a blockchain, which is a decentralized, public ledger that records all of the transactions on the network.\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin significant in the financial world is its unique characteristics and potential impact, one of them including decentralization. This decentralization provides several advantages, such as reducing the risk of censorship, enabling global accessibility, and fostering financial inclusion for those who are unbanked or underbanked.\n\nAnother significant feature of Bitcoin is its limited supply. Since there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, that makes it a deflationary asset. Additionally, the limited supply and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin contribute to its perceived value and the potential for price appreciation over time.\n\nUtilizing blockchain technology in Bitcoin transactions ensures transparency and immutability, thereby rendering the alteration or manipulation of transaction records a challenging task.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has gained attention as an alternative investment and a diversification tool. It has attracted interest from institutional investors, hedge funds, and even some governments. This growing acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin have led to the emergence of regulated exchanges, investment products, and services around cryptocurrency.\n\nEnrico Rubboli, the CEO of Mintlayer, told Nasdaq, \u201cInvestment firms recognize Bitcoin's potential as a store of value and inflation hedge. With its limited supply and decentralized nature, Bitcoin is seen by some as a way to preserve wealth in the face of inflationary pressures and currency devaluation. This appeal is particularly relevant given the unprecedented monetary stimulus measures central banks adopt worldwide.\u201d\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that Bitcoin also faces challenges and criticisms. Its price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and concerns about its use in illicit activities have raised questions about its stability and long-term viability as a mainstream currency. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has undeniably disrupted traditional financial systems and sparked a broader interest in blockchain technology.\n\nIt has stimulated innovation in various industries beyond finance, including supply chain management, voting systems, and decentralized applications. The potential for old institutions to change, for people to gain financial independence, and for the global economy to challenge the status quo of centralized control make Bitcoin significant in the financial world.\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin: Key players and their motivations\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin has seen significant growth, with key players from various sectors embracing cryptocurrency. These players include financial institutions, technology companies, and investment firms, each driven by unique motivations.\n\nFinancial institutions, including banks and asset management companies, have been actively exploring Bitcoin adoption. Their motivations include:\n\nDiversification and Portfolio Management: Financial institutions seek to diversify their investment portfolios by including Bitcoin. They view cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class that can potentially provide attractive returns and reduce overall portfolio risk. Client Demand and Retention: Many clients have expressed interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Financial institutions aim to meet this demand and retain their clients by offering cryptocurrency-related services and investment opportunities. Failing to address this demand could result in losing clients to competitors. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Some financial institutions view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation. They perceive Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply as features that can protect against the devaluation of traditional currencies and safeguard wealth.\n\nRubboli shared his views on institutional investors' interests in Bitcoin, telling Nasdaq \"Investment firms, including hedge funds and institutional investors, have been attracted to Bitcoin for various reasons. Firstly, the potential for significant returns has been a major motivation.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable price appreciation over the years, and some investment firms view it as an opportunity to generate alpha and outperform traditional markets. The volatility of Bitcoin, although a risk, can also provide substantial profit opportunities for those with the expertise to navigate the market.\"\n\nTechnology Companies: Technology companies, particularly those involved in payment processing and digital services, have shown interest in Bitcoin adoption. Their motivations include:\n\nInnovation and Market Expansion: Technology companies strive to stay at the forefront of emerging trends and technologies. By incorporating Bitcoin into their offerings, they can position themselves as innovative players and expand their market reach. Seamless Payments: Bitcoin's blockchain technology enables fast and secure peer-to-peer transactions. Technology companies recognize the potential for seamless cross-border payments and cost-effective remittance services by leveraging Bitcoin's decentralized network.\n\nInvestment firms, including hedge funds and institutional investors, have been increasingly involved in Bitcoin. Their motivations include:\n\nPotential Returns: Bitcoin's historical price performance and volatility have attracted investment firms seeking potentially high returns. They view Bitcoin as a speculative investment opportunity that can yield significant profits if properly managed. Portfolio Diversification: Investment firms aim to diversify their investment strategies by adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. By diversifying across different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, they can minimize risk and potentially enhance overall portfolio performance. Store of Value and Inflation Hedge: Some investment firms perceive Bitcoin as a digital store of value similar to gold. They view it as a potential hedge against inflation and a long-term investment that can preserve wealth in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin is driven by motivations such as portfolio diversification, meeting client demand, hedging against economic uncertainty, innovation, market expansion, potential returns, and viewing Bitcoin as a store of value or inflation hedge. The participation of key players from various sectors signifies the growing acceptance and recognition of Bitcoin's potential impact on the financial landscape.\n\nFuture outlook for Bitcoin and institutional investors\n\nThe future outlook for Bitcoin in relation to institutional investors is promising and evolving. Institutional investors have demonstrated a growing interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, indicating a potential shift in the financial landscape.\n\nRubboli said, \"The future outlook for Bitcoin concerning institutional investors appears promising. Institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency market has been steadily increasing, and there are indications that this trend will continue. As more institutional investors recognize the potential benefits and opportunities associated with Bitcoin, we expect to see further capital inflows into the market.\"\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin is expected to continue as more institutions recognize the benefits and opportunities presented by digital assets. This increased participation brings stability, liquidity, and credibility to the cryptocurrency market, fostering a favorable environment for Bitcoin's growth and acceptance.\n\nAs institutional investors enter the space, they contribute to the overall maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Their involvement introduces professional expertise, risk management strategies, and regulatory compliance measures. This development helps to address concerns related to security, custody, and regulatory frameworks, making Bitcoin more accessible and attractive to a broader range of investors.\n\nInstitutional investors are poised to play a pivotal role in Bitcoin's future and its incorporation into the financial landscape as the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector continues to expand and regulatory frameworks change.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nBlackRock pushed further into cryptocurrencies on Thursday by filing an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nIf the SEC approves the application, the fund would trade on the Nasdaq stock market, making it the first publicly traded spot bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nThe $9tn money manager already runs a private spot bitcoin trust that it launched last year. The ETF marks a further expansion of its partnership with embattled crypto exchange Coinbase, which would be the custodian of the fund\u2019s bitcoin.\n\nThe launch of a spot bitcoin ETF by the world\u2019s largest money manager could be a shot in the arm for cryptocurrencies after a run of bad news including the collapse of FTX last year and the SEC\u2019s decision earlier this month to sue both Coinbase and the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, alleging securities violations.\n\nBut it is not clear that the SEC will approve BlackRock\u2019s application. It has already turned down several earlier proposals from other asset managers on the grounds that the tokens trade on unregulated exchanges with surveillance and manipulation risks.\n\nThe watchdog is being sued by Grayscale over its refusal to allow the conversion of what was then the world\u2019s largest crypto investment vehicle into a listed ETF. The lawsuit contends that the SEC\u2019s decision was arbitrary, particularly because it has allowed the launch of ETFs based on bitcoin futures.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s move also comes at a time when the SEC has proposed new custody rules that would place additional responsibilities on asset managers to make sure that customer assets are kept in properly segregated accounts.\n\nThe price of bitcoin is down more than 60 per cent from its 2021 peak, but it has also bounced significantly from the lows it hit last year after FTX went bust.\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s increasing engagement shows Bitcoin continues to be an asset of interest for some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions,\u201d said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, which provides the bitcoin price that BlackRock plans to use.\n\n\u201cAn estimated 20 per cent of Americans have now owned bitcoin at some point. BlackRock\u2019s proposed ETF potentially offers the other 80 per cent an option that is altogether more familiar and accessible.\u201d\n\nBlackRock declined to comment beyond the filing. But founder Larry Fink, who was once openly sceptical of cryptocurrencies, wrote in his annual letter to investors in March that \u201cvery interesting developments are happening in the digital asset space . . . At BlackRock we continue to explore the digital assets ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAnd during its investor day earlier this week, executives touted the group\u2019s ability to launch new ETFs and offer clients a wide range of asset classes. It currently has more than 1,300 different ETFs."

The U.S. regulator has yet to approve any applications for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nLast year, BlackRock launched a spot bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the United States.\n\nThe move comes at a time when the global cryptocurrency industry has been caught in the crosshairs of the U.S. securities regulator on alleged violations of securities laws.\n\nEarlier this month, the regulator sued major exchanges Coinbase and Binance in high-profile lawsuits that reverberated through the digital assets industry.\n\n\"The fact that BlackRock, a well-respected and established asset management company, has filed for a Bitcoin ETF could be seen as a positive development in the quest for regulatory approval,\" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology group XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.\n\n\"It also shows resilience of the public's interest in crypto.\"\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would track bitcoin's underlying market price. Proponents say an ETF would give investors exposure to bitcoin without directly buying it.\n\nThe SEC rejected Grayscale Investment LLC\u2019s application last year to convert its flagship spot Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nGrayscale sued the SEC, claiming that the regulator was acting arbitrarily in rejecting applications for spot bitcoin ETFs when it had previously approved bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe SEC has also rejected proposals for spot bitcoin ETFs from firms including Fidelity, Cboe Global Markets and NYDIG.\n\nBitcoin prices closed up 2% on Thursday after the announcement. They were last at $25,506 on Friday. The largest cryptocurrency is up 54% in the year.\n\nPlans for BlackRock's ETF were reported by CoinDesk earlier in the day.\n\n(Reporting by Manya Saini and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Ankur Banerjee and Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by Devika Syamnath and Pooja Desai)"

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Thus far in 2023, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has been one of the top performing cryptocurrencies, up more than 57%. Bitcoin trades for about $26,000 after briefly breaking through the $30,000 price level earlier this year.\n\nBut Bitcoin is still nowhere near its all-time high of $68,789, which it reached in November 2021. Nonetheless, a growing number of analysts, investors, and crypto enthusiasts still think that Bitcoin will break through the $100,000 level sometime in 2024. While that price trajectory might sound outrageous, there are three compelling reasons it might just happen.\n\nBitcoin as digital gold\n\nThe core argument around Bitcoin is that it functions as \"digital gold,\" making it a good store of value, especially amid volatile economic conditions. Thus, during the banking crisis that kicked off earlier this year, investors looking for a safe-haven asset outside of the traditional banking and financial system turned to Bitcoin. And, indeed, the correlation between Bitcoin and gold has increased in 2023.\n\nIf you buy into the argument that Bitcoin is digital gold, then it's possible to make a number of forward-looking price assumptions. For example, noteworthy Bitcoin investor Michael Saylor first calculated the value of the total physical supply of gold in the world (now about $13 trillion) and then proposed a similar valuation for Bitcoin. If you divide the market cap of gold by the maximum number of Bitcoins that will ever be in circulation (21 million), it is possible to come up with a $500,000 price target for Bitcoin. And Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs used roughly the same methodology back in January 2022 to come up with a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional adoption\n\nOK, but what if you got burned by Bitcoin in 2022 and are still skeptical? Gold, after all, does not lose 65% of its value in one year. Fair enough. There's another route to the magical $100,000 price level, and it involves the long-term growth story around institutional adoption. Bitcoin, after all, is more than just a store of value. It is also a form of payment and a potential replacement for various building blocks of the modern financial system, including the U.S. dollar.\n\nNoted investor Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, has analyzed eight different use cases for Bitcoin in the global economic system. For example, Bitcoin is becoming part of the money supply of emerging market nations. And Bitcoin is also accounting for a larger and larger share of cross-border remittances. By taking a closer look at each of these eight areas, and then extrapolating growth rates going forward, Wood came up with a $1.48 million price target for Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nFinally, there's one technical event that could influence the price of Bitcoin, known as the halving. This event occurs only once every four years, and is highly anticipated by the Bitcoin community. In a halving event, the reward paid to Bitcoin miners for mining a new block on the blockchain falls by one-half.\n\nThis might not sound like a big deal (unless you happen to be a Bitcoin miner), but it has tremendous consequences for the supply and demand of Bitcoin. For one, it slows the rate of Bitcoin's supply increase over time. Secondly, it increases the relative scarcity of Bitcoin. Theoretically, the combination of these two factors should help to push up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd, indeed, that is what has happened in three previous halving events. In the last halving, which took place in 2020, Bitcoin's price exploded by 688% and eventually neared its all-time high. Well, guess what? The next Bitcoin halving is scheduled for April 2024, and investors are already putting out aggressive price targets north of $100,000 for Bitcoin. For example, Standard Chartered Bank thinks Bitcoin will hit that figure by the end of 2024.\n\nThe path to $100,000\n\nAs can be seen, there are various paths that Bitcoin can take to reach $100,000. Although the price target might sound absurdly high, especially given the current macroeconomic environment, the potential is certainly there. Of course, there are wildcard factors, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could move to regulate Bitcoin at any moment. And don't forget about the Federal Reserve, which has shown the ability to hammer the price of Bitcoin simply by hiking interest rates.\n\nThat said, I remain bullish on Bitcoin both short-term and long-term. While it is certainly a volatile digital asset, it has a long track record of market-beating performance that dates back nearly a decade. From my perspective, it is no longer a question of if Bitcoin will reach a price of $100,000, but when."

        "content": "MicroStrategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor believes the crypto industry will consolidate around Bitcoin following the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV, Saylor said regulators \u201cdon\u2019t have any love for crypto tokens\u201d and have taken a narrow perspective on what a crypto exchange should be.\n\n\u201cTheir view is crypto exchanges should trade and hold pure digital commodities like Bitcoin,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cAnd so the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a Bitcoin-focused industry, with maybe a half a dozen to a dozen other proof-of-work tokens.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance has grown in recent months, with it now making up about 48% of the crypto market, compared with 43% at the end of February, according to CoinMarketCap. Saylor thinks Bitcoin\u2019s dominance could eventually reach 80%.\n\nThat could put exchanges in a tough spot.

If Bitcoin\u2019s dominance grows, trading alongside a smaller stable of peers, that could further depress top-line numbers.\n\nCoinbase reported just $374 million in trading fees in the first quarter, compared with $1.013 billion in the same quarter last year, a decrease of nearly two-thirds. But in stark contrast to last year, when trading fees made up 86% of first-quarter revenue, this year it was just under half.\n\nSaylor brushed off any potential threat to exchanges should there be a consolidation around Bitcoin, insisting they\u2019ll still have a key role to play in the industry\u2014and in the U.S. Already, though, several exchanges and companies in the crypto space are looking abroad. Coinbase in May launched an international exchange in Bermuda, and other companies have said they\u2019re looking for a foothold in Hong Kong as China may be warming to crypto.\n\nMany institutional investors, Saylor continued, are confused or put off by the vast array of cryptocurrencies available, and they\u2019re more likely to invest in the sector if it becomes more Bitcoin-focused. Despite the cryptocurrency\u2019s 4.5% slump, to below $26,000, since the SEC lawsuits were announced last week, Saylor, long a proponent of Bitcoin, remained firm.\n\n\u201cEventually, I have confidence that the crypto exchanges will come around to realizing that Bitcoin really is the dominant asset in this space, and their business models are fine when Bitcoin goes up by a factor of 10,\u201d Saylor said.\n\nThe MicroStrategy founder has led the company\u2019s strategy of accumulating billions of dollars in Bitcoin, even as he stepped down as CEO last year. As of April, the company owned about 140,000 Bitcoin, bought at an average price of $29,803, according to Saylor. Those holdings are worth $3.6 billion as of Wednesday, down about $1 billion from their value in April."

        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nCryptocurrency prices fell after the Federal Reserve's June meeting, with bitcoin falling below $25,000 for the first time since March.\n\nOn Thursday, bitcoin was lower by more than 1% at $25,439.77, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it fell as low as $24,766.52. Ether fell more than 3% to $1,667.56.\n\nAltcoins tumbled too. Solana's token was down 2.3%, Polygon's fell 8.3% and Cardano's lost %3.5.\n\nAnd selling pressure weighed on Tether (USDT), which lost its peg to the U.S. dollar on most exchanges Thursday, falling to 99 cents in its biggest drop since November.\n\nBitcoin cut most of its Thursday morning losses in the afternoon as traders mulled the possibility of the first spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., following a CoinDesk report that BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is close to filing an application for a bitcoin ETF. The report was light on detail, however, and didn't specify how it would get exposure \u2014 whether by tracking spot bitcoin or bitcoin futures.\n\nThe initial slide began late Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve ended its June meeting and decided to leave interest rates unchanged for now, but said two more may be in store by yearend.\n\nFor cryptocurrencies, \"this has little to do with the FOMC, and more to do with thinner liquidity and weak sentiment,\" said Michael Safai, managing partner at Dexterity Capital. \"Given how thin trading volumes are at the moment, a sizable (but not massive) sell order is enough to set off liquidations.\"\n\n\"Traders are more inclined to keep their money off the table in the midst of this regulatory backlash, especially when it comes to altcoins, so there isn't going to be much new capital flowing in to buoy prices so readily,\" he added."

        "content": "The price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped below $25,000 on Wednesday for the first time since March, as the U.S. central bank announced that it would pause increases in interest rates since hiking them up consecutively for more than a year.\n\nThe dip happened dramatically late Wednesday afternoon, according to data from CoinMarketCap, and in roughly an hour, the price of Bitcoin plummeted from approximately $25,868 to about $24,902. As of Thursday morning, the price has stabilized, with one Bitcoin hovering around $24,900, an approximate 4% decline since Wednesday afternoon.\n\nEther, the native cryptocurrency for the Ethereum blockchain and second-largest token by market cap, also dropped from about $1,728 to $1,635, about 5%, per CoinMarketCap. And the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies dropped from about $1.06 trillion to now $1.02 trillion, roughly 4%.\n\n\u201cThe biggest reason for [Bitcoin\u2019s] sudden plunge yesterday was likely the Fed, where, despite pausing, it took a more hawkish tone than expected and indicated that more rate hikes are still on the table,\u201d Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told Fortune. \u201cIn addition, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the market due to the U.S. regulatory posture.\u201d\n\nRudick noted that Ether dropped before Bitcoin and the market downturn was \u201cETH-led.\u201d\n\nThe downswing of the cryptocurrency market mirrored the immediate decline of the major stock indexes after the Federal Reserve announced the pause on rate increases. The S&P 500 immediately dropped about 1%. (It then quickly rebounded before markets closed.) The Nasdaq, which is comparatively dominated by the tech stocks that Bitcoin has been previously said to mirror, also had a brief drop and rebound.\n\nThe decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price reflects how the cryptocurrency tends to react quickly to news of the Fed\u2019s decision to increase, decrease, or hold steady interest rates.\n\nIn May, for example, its price rocketed above $29,000 following the Fed\u2019s announcement that it would continue to raise rates. However, Bitcoin has since fallen more than $4,000, an approximate 14% decrease, as the U.S. government has continued to crack down on crypto, including blockbuster lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, two of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges."

Numerous issuers have thrown their hat into the same ring, and none succeeded in launching a product. However, given its status in the ETF industry at a global level, if successful, BlackRock has the potential to dominate the space, even if it doesn\u2019t achieve first-to-market status.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been consistently against spot-based bitcoin ETFs trading. They have concerns about fraud and manipulation. However, if a product were to go to market, it would be a huge success given BlackRock\u2019s industry leadership and connections with advisors,\u201d said VettaFi Head of Research Todd Rosenbluth.\n\nA Long Wait\n\nCertainly, the wait for a physical Bitcoin ETF has been long and tumultuous. More than a decade ago, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed with the SEC to launch the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. It has been a long line of rejections ever since.\n\nFirms like Fidelity, WisdomTree, and VanEck have all seen their applications to launch such a product go nowhere. And Grayscale is currently suing the SEC to be allowed to convert its $15.9 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The firm argues that the fund\u2019s large discount would disappear if it could do so, benefiting its investors.\n\nIn October 2021, ProShares scored a major victory when the SEC approved its ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the first ETF to invest in bitcoin futures. For many investors, that was the next best thing to a physical Bitcoin ETF. The fund quickly accumulated $1 billion in assets under management over the course of a couple of days. That said, nearly two years later, that amount has fallen to $823.2 million. The cryptocurrency currently trades well off the highs that it reached in 2021.\n\nThe SEC has long maintained that cryptocurrencies could be subject to manipulation and that there are not enough protections for investors. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been adamant that those issues must be addressed for the SEC to approve a physical Bitcoin ETF. But BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world and could mount a compelling campaign for approval."

The collaboration emphasizes hands-on learning and will allow participating students a chance to earn a new Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Advanced Technical Certificate through Dallas College.\n\n\u201cOur collaboration with the Texas Blockchain Council positions Dallas College as a leader in technology education for the digital economy,\u201d said Dallas College Chancellor Justin Lonon. \u201cDallas College has always been committed to providing our students with the most relevant and valuable educational experiences. This unique partnership with the TBC will allow us to stay at the forefront of technological innovation and prepare our students for the digital economy.\u201d\n\nThe partnership comes at a time when Texas is becoming a leader in bitcoin mining. Under the partnership, Dallas College will also host a unique bitcoin miner installation at Richland Campus.\n\nSteve Kinard, director of bitcoin mining for the Texas Blockchain Council, said, \u201cOur collaboration with Dallas College isn\u2019t just about installing a bitcoin miner; it\u2019s about creating an environment where students can immerse themselves in cutting-edge technology. The digital economy demands a workforce with a deep understanding of high-performance computing and blockchain concepts, and we\u2019re here to ensure that Dallas College students are ready to meet that demand.\u201d\n\nAs the future of the economy shifts towards digitalization, Dallas College is stepping up to ensure its students are prepared for the technological changes that are revolutionizing industries worldwide and working alongside industry partners.\n\nThe installation of a bitcoin miner at Richland Campus allows students to gain firsthand experience with the technology that powers the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency. Key technical supporters of the initiative include Luxor Technologies and Bentaus Mining. The Texas Blockchain Council donated the hardware at no cost to Dallas College. And 100% of the bitcoin proceeds from the operation will go to Dallas College Foundation to support its mission.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to team up with Dallas College and the Texas Blockchain Council to continue to bring education and awareness of how bitcoin really works,\u201d said Bob Davidoff, founder of Bentaus Mining. \u201cIt all starts at the academic level to provide real information regarding the technologies of the future.\u201d\n\nEthan Vera, COO of Luxor Technologies, said, \u201cDallas College is leading the way when it comes to forward-thinking adoption of bitcoin mining and the benefits it brings to the Texas grid and society. Luxor is pleased to support this institution with our full suite of software products.\u201d\n\nThe mining installation is being facilitated through a relationship with Coinbase Institutional. Anthony Basili, head of asset allocators for Coinbase Institutional, said, \u201cCoinbase is a global leader in providing trusted and compliant access to digital assets and custody solutions. I am proud to be able to support this initiative and see my hometown of Dallas leading the way.\u201d\n\nThe Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Advanced Technical Certificate is available at all seven Dallas College campuses.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether, top 10 crypto in red, Fed warning of more rate hikes - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Thursday morning trading in Asia, dropping below US$25,000 at one stage for the first time since mid-March. Ether also retreated with other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies as trading volumes dipped and the U.S. Fed left interest rates unchanged as expected, but warned of more hikes this year to tackle inflation. Ripple\u2019s XRP token fell despite the release of documents this week that were expected to help the company\u2019s defense in an SEC lawsuit.\n\nCrypto in red\n\nBitcoin fell 2.94% over the last 24 hours to US$25,062.60 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 4.69% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about US$490 billion, dipped below the US$25,000 support line to as low as US$24,902 earlier in the morning.\n\nEther fell 4.74% to US$1,652.25, posting a 9.70% loss for the week. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nCardano dropped 4.10% to US$0.2624, losing 18.57% of its value in the past seven days. Solana fell 3.18% to US$14.44 and posted a weekly loss of 22.52%.\n\nThe two tokens have been on a downtrend since being named in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit filed last week against the Binance.US and Coinbase exchanges, where the federal agency categorized the two \u2014 along with many other altcoins \u2014 as financial securities.\n\nBenjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport, said the declines are mostly the overhang from the SEC suing Binance and Coinbase.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been predominantly the altcoins that have been dropping,\u201d said Stani. \u201cBTC and, to some extent, ETH as well have been holding up better and that I think is mostly attributable to the fact that the SEC named a lot of [altcoins] as securities and that has this chilling effect.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as expected on Wednesday at 5% to 5.25% after ten consecutive hikes to curb inflation.\n\nBut in another negative for investors, Fed chair Jerome Powell said it may take years to get inflation under control, dousing expectations for rate cuts later this year and raising the likelihood of higher interest rates ahead. Stocks ended mixed.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the losers in the crypto top 10 by market capitalization, falling 7.48% to US$0.4793 on the day for a weekly loss of 7.19%.\n\nThe declines came despite the release of the so-called \u201cHinman documents,\u201d this week, a collection of previously sealed emails and pages from former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman. The notes indicate that Ether should not be categorized as a financial security.\n\nRipple Labs Inc. was sued by the SEC in December 2020 on allegations XRP was sold as an illegal unregistered security. Ripple wanted the Hinman documents made public, arguing they show the SEC itself was sending mixed and confused signals over whether cryptocurrencies were securities and failing to offer clear guidance to the industry, which is part of Ripple\u2019s fair notice defense in the case.\n\nHowever, XRP\u2019s price hasn\u2019t benefited from the release of the documents. Gabriel Shapiro, a U.S.-based attorney and the general counsel at blockchain firm Delphi Labs, wrote on Twitter Tuesday \u2014 \u201c\u200b\u200bHinman emails are a nothingburger though great for Ether. No idea why Ripple thinks these emails help Ripple\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nShapiro added that the documents were not the bombshell compared to the \u201chuge hype\u201d given to them.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap lost 2.76% to US$1.02 trillion in the last 24 hours, and the daily crypto trading volume fell 5.37% to US$31.89 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT on downtrend\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 0.86% to 2,912.74 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.64% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 0.13% to US$23.7 million, while sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, fell 4.78% over the last 24 hours to US$13.52 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThe Bitcoin network was the second largest NFT network in terms of transactions, rising 6.95% to US$4.1 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe recent buzz in the NFT community is around ERC-6551, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. ERC-6551 is the latest NFT standard for the Ethereum network that went into effect on May 7 this year.\n\n\u201cERC-6551 is introducing a standard for NFTs by unlocking their ability to be a smart wallet that can interact with different decentralized apps in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cWith ERC-6551, when you transfer an NFT, the wallet and the tokens that the NFT holds also goes with it. Basically wallets within wallets.\u201d\n\nAbout 196 million of Blur tokens worth around US$62 million, 40% of the circulating supply, are being unlocked and distributed to investors and contributors on Wednesday, U.S. time. Blur is the native utility and governance tokens of the Blur NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201c[This] will almost definitely cause a crash in price, which will impact NFT prices,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cBasically, if the token is devalued, will people still want to farm for it via trading NFTs?\u201d\n\nTransactions of Uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 topped sales by collection, selling US$3.14 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum-based BoringPunks marked second with US$1.63 million in sales, with over 20,000 transactions in the past day.\n\nU.S. equity futures edge down\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after a mixed regular trading day on Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.09%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.06% lower and Nasdaq Futures lost 0.09%.\n\nThe U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday. The rate is at its highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage last year.\n\nHowever, post-meeting comments from Powell hinted at two more rate hikes by the end of this year, while stating that rate cuts will not happen unless inflation is under control. That didn\u2019t go down well with some business leaders.\n\n\u201cThe battle against inflation is being won. This is now the time for the Fed to stop \u2013 not pause \u2013 interest rate hikes,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\n\u201cThe time lag for monetary policies is notoriously long \u2014 it typically takes about 18 months to two years for the full effect of rate hikes to filter fully into the economy,\u201d Green said, adding that excessive rate hikes could lead to a recession in the U.S.\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 25 to 26.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 30.6% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at July\u2019s meeting, while 69.4% says the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points.\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "content": "The world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is reportedly on the cusp of filing an application for a bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nBlackRock will work with Coinbase Custody, which will provide spot market data for pricing and hold the underlying assets of the ETF, a person familiar with the matter told Coindesk.\n\nBlackRock declined to comment on the filing.\n\nThe US asset manager first partnered with Coinbase last August to offer its institutional clients the ability to buy bitcoin through its Aladdin platform.\n\nIn the same month, BlackRock launched a spot bitcoin trust for its US institutional clients \u2013 the firm\u2019s first structured vehicle wrapping direct crypto exposure.\n\nBoth announcements were accompanied by statements from BlackRock detailing \u201csignificant interest\u201d in the asset class from its clients.\n\nLast March, the firm\u2019s founder, chairman and CEO Larry Fink said his firm was \u201cstudying digital currencies, stablecoins and the underlying technologies to understand how they can help us serve our clients\u201d.\n\nBlackRock previously told ETF Stream it had \u201cno plans\u201d to launch an exchange-traded crypto product.\n\nA spokesperson said: \u201cIt is worth noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve an application for a spot bitcoin ETP.\n\n\u201cIn general, any decision as to whether to launch iShares exchange-traded products (ETPs) is based on an array of factors including market and asset dynamics, regulatory considerations and client demand.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether its anticipated bitcoin ETF filing will be for a spot or synthetically replicated product \u2013 or whether the firm anticipates the SEC to remove its current ban on spot crypto ETFs.\n\nSpeaking on the possibility of a BlackRock crypto ETF, Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, previously said: \u201cIt may not be far off given they are now committed. It seems like the next logical step.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s signalled entry into the space would mark just the latest large asset manager tapping wrapped digital asset exposures.\n\nInvesco and Fidelity already have crypto ETPs in Europe.

        "title": "Bitcoin and tether sag as crypto markets face mounting pressures - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies faced renewed pressure Thursday as the industry grappled with new challenges on numerous fronts.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD), the largest digital coin, slipped 4% and fell to its lowest level in the past three months. Other major cryptocurrencies dipped, with ether (ETH-USD) and BNB (BNB-USD) falling more than 5% and a stablecoin called tether going below its crucial $1 price.\n\nThose drops dragged the total market value for all crypto assets to its lowest level since the banking turmoil began in March, according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nPublicly traded crypto companies also fell, including the stock of Coinbase Global (COIN). Other crypto stocks including MicroStrategy (MSTR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Marathon Digital (MARA) sold off as well.\n\nThe new price pressures follow assurances from the Federal Reserve that it isn\u2019t done hiking interest rates this year along with reports that crypto lending platforms Delio and Haru paused withdrawals after facing heightened requests from customers.\n\nRegulators also are turning up the heat on the industry with two new lawsuits filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission last week against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, alleging that 19 specific cryptocurrencies are securities and thus should be registered with the SEC.\n\nThose tokens \u2014 which include BNB, SOL, ADA, and MATIC \u2014 have fallen 10-14% since the lawsuits.\n\n\"Until the regulatory environment is better, cryptos might struggle here,\" Oanda market analyst Edward Moya said Thursday.\n\n'Markets are edgy'\n\nThe multiple pressure points leave the industry with another problem: a lot of sellers and not enough buyers. Major trading firms that once might have acted as market makers have retrenched over the last year.\n\nIn the last week trading volumes have fallen on Coinbase and Binance. Liquidity is also lower on Binance's US-affiliated platform, Binance.US. The amount of money available for trading on Binance's US-affiliated platform fell 75% following last week's SEC charges, according to Kaiko Research.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Everything is coming together all at once and we have thin liquidity in markets now,\" crypto investor and entrepreneur Thomas Dunleavy told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAnother sign of increased stress is the pressure on tether (USDT), the market\u2019s largest dollar-pegged stablecoin by market capitalization and trading volume.\n\nIt fell as much as 0.20% between Wednesday and Thursday, its biggest one-day drop since November.\n\nAs of Thursday at 2:00 AM New York time, the $83 billion stablecoin, which isn\u2019t supposed to fluctuate below its crucial $1 price, fell to $0.9958. It is issued by a company called Tether.\n\n\u201cMarkets are edgy in these days, so it's easy for attackers to capitalize on this general sentiment,\u201d Tether\u2019s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino said over Twitter earlier Thursday.\n\nMarkets are edgy in these days, so it's easy for attackers to capitalize on this general sentiment.\n\nBut at Tether we're ready as always. Let them come.\n\nWe're ready to redeem any amount. \u2014 Paolo Ardoino \ud83c\udf50 (@paoloardoino) June 15, 2023\n\nTether tokens are collateralized by other assets the company holds in reserves, including 85% in cash and cash equivalents such as US Treasuries, 6.5% in secured loans, and 4% in precious metals according to its March 31 reserve report.\n\nWhen the stablecoin slips below its $1 peg, \"verified\" market participants also can make a profit by buying the token and redeeming it for other currencies.\n\nHowever, in periods of heightened selling, the redemption process does not always keep up with the market.\n\nIn May 2022, the so-called \u201calgorithmic stablecoin\u201d terraUSD collapsed after slipping too far below its $1 peg, causing a rapid shift in sentiment that led to a loss in confidence for the coin by the market leading to its ultimate collapse.\n\nDuring the month of terra\u2019s collapse, Tether\u2019s Ardoino told Yahoo Finance that Tether faced heightened withdrawals as investors rushed to liquidate $10 billion worth of holdings in 11 days.\n\nDespite temporarily slipping as low as 95 cents during the period, it gradually regained its $1 price over the following weeks.\n\nToday, Ardoino struck a defiant tone on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe're ready as always. Let them come. We're ready to redeem any amount,\u201d Ardoino said in his tweet.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "Payments giant Block announced on Thursday that it will finally give the general public a taste of its Bitcoin self-custody wallet, Bitkey, in an external beta. (The company, headed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, previously conducted an in-house beta open only to Block employees.)\n\nBitkey will partner with Cash App, another Block product, as well as the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase to enable users to transfer Bitcoin directly into customers\u2019 wallets.\n\nUsers will be able to buy crypto from the two platforms when the Bitcoin-only wallet is formally launched outside beta, Lindsey Grossman, the business lead for Bitkey, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cOur strong belief is that self-custody is the best place to hold and manage your Bitcoin,\u201d she said, adding later: \u201cIf anything goes wrong with a custodial platform, you know that\u2014this industry has had a lot of ups and downs\u2014you\u2019re protected.\u201d\n\nThe step forward in the development and eventual launch of Bitkey is part of the payments giant\u2019s larger bet on Bitcoin and Web3.\n\nIn 2018, Dorsey, a Bitcoin evangelist, integrated Bitcoin buying and selling into Cash App. Formerly called Square, the company then said in 2021 that it would rebrand itself as Block, emphasizing its new focus on Bitcoin and blockchain. In 2022, the payments firm unveiled that it was developing a Bitcoin hardware wallet, with a developer sharing images of the device a month later.\n\nOn a video call with Fortune, Grossman briefly flashed the wallet, a flat hexagonal device with a fingerprint scanner that fits into one\u2019s palm. Bitkey\u2019s hardware component is one-third of a \u201cmultisig,\u201d or multisignature, setup.\n\nBlock\u2019s self-custody wallet consists of a mobile app as well as a hardware device. Courtesy of Bitkey\n\nLike multifactor authentication, where platforms like Google ask users to provide a password as well as enter a code sent to their cell phones to access their accounts, multisignature wallets require sign-offs on multiple keys to approve any transaction. To be valid, the majority of keys require sign-offs.\n\nBitkey has three keys. One is on users\u2019 cell phones, another is stored on the hexagonal piece of hardware, and Block holds the final key. To pay for coffee with, say, Bitcoin, a user needs to sign off on the transaction on both their hardware device and cell phone.\n\n(Bitkey allows wallet holders to set a floor for when they\u2019ll need to use their hardware device, Grossman, the business lead, told Fortune. In other words, only with transactions above $100, for example, will users need both their cell phone and the Bitkey device to authorize the payment.)\n\nBlock holds the final key to circumvent the tricky problem with self-custody: As with cash, if users lose their keys, they lose their crypto. (See, for example, the man searching for a key to hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin in a garbage dump.)\n\n\u201cWe are able to help you recover your wallet and recover both your mobile key through a cloud backup and then also help you get a new piece of hardware and create a new hardware key,\u201d Grossman told Fortune.\n\nTo test out Bitkey in the external beta, interested users need to fill out a short application. While Grossman declined to specify in which quarter Block plans to release the wallet, she did say the firm is aiming for later this year."

Bitcoin \u2014 the largest cryptocurrency \u2014 could provide people with a decentralized financial system that is more secure and streamlined and difficult to counterfeit.\n\nBut as bullish as people are on Bitcoin, there\u2019s been a difficult-to-ignore shadow looming over the industry: its perceived energy consumption. All cryptocurrency transactions are recorded through a process called mining. This process requires many verified crypto miners to validate a transaction by solving incredibly difficult mathematical puzzles. This acts as a way to verify all transactions in a decentralized manner, but because Bitcoin mining requires a lot of computing power, it uses a decent amount of energy.\n\nNow, a new data center is moving away from users to harness renewable energy at its source: West Texas."

        "title": "Buying Bitcoin is preferable to BTC mining in most circumstances \u2014 Analysis - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "While, intuitively, mining Bitcoin may appear like a highly profitable endeavor, research suggests otherwise.\n\nAfter discovering Bitcoin (BTC), most users go down the rabbit hole and consider whether it is better to mine or buy Bitcoin directly. They usually give up on mining due to the cost and rigor of running ASIC miners, regulatory uncertainty and the lack of technical expertise.\n\nHypothetically, if people overcome the above challenges, they could enjoy advantages such as full autonomy over their operations and diversification of their crypto investment via physical hardware instead of directly purchasing Bitcoin, but the entire venture can be risky and labor intensive.\n\nTo mine, or not to mine BTC?\n\nAn analysis by Bitcoin mining data firm Hashrate Index suggests that \u201cbuying bitcoin is preferable to mining it in most circumstances.\u201d\n\nJaran Mellerud, a Bitcoin mining analyst at Hashrate Index, calculated the projected earnings of miners in the next five years under various bullish and bearish scenarios. Mellerud found that miners will likely incur a loss even in optimistic Bitcoin price projections.\n\nMining is a dynamic business where hardware usually gets outdated within five years due to the introduction of more efficient machines in the market.\n\nFor instance, in the 2016-2017 bull market, the Bitmain S9 models were the most efficient miners. However, as more models entered the market, the S9s were phased out completely by the end of 2022, according to a recent finding by Coin Metrics analyst Karim Helmy.\n\nTwo Bitmain models in the S19j Pro and S19 XP class have dominated the mining sector in 2023. Mellerud calculated the returns assuming that the current batch of miners will be scrapped five years from now, around the 2028 Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe analysis used a constant cost of electricity of $0.07 per kWh and varied the price of Bitcoin and the network\u2019s hash rate to estimate the profit margins of the machines.\n\nIn his report, Mellerud wrote, \u201cHashrate tends to follow the hashprice, albeit with a lag during rapid bitcoin price increases.\u201d\n\nNotably, the electricity cost varies worldwide, and miners can also establish exclusive deals with energy generation companies that lock their costs for months, which may also entail a discount. Figures from a New York Times investigation revealed that Riot Platforms, a public Bitcoin miner, paid around $0.03 per kWh in Texas, while other industries paid around $0.07.\n\nMellerud said, \u201cMining is a no-brainer if you have access to electricity prices below $0.04 per kWh.\u201d\n\nFive-year projections for Bitcoin miner returns\n\nBitcoin miners are profitable only if they can recoup 100% of their capital spent in buying the machines, excluding operational costs. Any additional BTC that hardware brings to its owner is an additional gain.\n\nFor instance, if a Bitcoin-denominated investment of 1 BTC in mining rigs returns 0.9 BTC at the end of five years, buying BTC is preferable to mining.\n\nHashrate Index\u2019s analysts found that miners will return north of 1 BTC only in the most bullish scenarios, where the Bitcoin price goes on to $500,000 per token by 2028 while the network\u2019s hash rate grows 10% slower than its price.\n\nEven in situations where Bitcoin reaches $250,000 by 2028 with a modest increase in its hash rate, the miners would only recoup 83% of the initial cost at best.\n\nReturn on investment from Bitcoin miners denominated in BTC over the next five years. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nRelated: $160K at next halving? Model counts down to new Bitcoin all-time high\n\nWhile Hashrate Index\u2019s analysis relied on future projections, River Financial, a financial services firm specializing in Bitcoin mining research, looked at historical data to find out whether mining was a better option than directly purchasing BTC. River Financial\u2019s analysts found that in the last five years, owning miners was preferred 53.6% of the time.\n\nThe basis of the River Financial analysis is similar to that of Hashrate Index\u2019s report \u2014 miners make a profit if Bitcoin\u2019s price increases faster than the network\u2019s hash rate over time or if the price decreases at a slower rate than the network\u2019s hash rate.\n\nTimes when Bitcoin mining was preferred (in gray) over direct BTC purchases (in white). Source: River Financial\n\nHowever, one caveat of this analysis is that even during times when Bitcoin\u2019s price is rising faster than the hash rate, the miners may still incur a loss due to the actual price being low.\n\nBearish periods have been particularly tough on Bitcoin miners. For instance, the period toward the end of 2022 is marked as preferable, while Bitcoin miners recorded the lowest revenue levels in two years with a significant wave of miner capitulations during that time.\n\nBoth reports appear to agree that mining Bitcoin only makes the most sense right before parabolic bullish periods, with direct Bitcoin purchases being more profitable at all other times.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Both Bitcoin and Ether fell in Wednesday afternoon trade in Asia, with Ripple\u2019s XRP leading losses among the other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Other tokens in the top 10 traded mixed, with crypto exchange Binance\u2019s BNB token leading the gains amid its ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors are looking forward to the U.S. central bank\u2019s decision on interest rates to be announced later on Wednesday, with the Federal Reserve expected to keep rates unchanged at 5%-5.25%.\n\nSee related article: How American courts have become central to crypto law\n\nXRP leads losses, BNB gains\n\nBitcoin fell 0.69% to US$25,894 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost 3.40% in the past week following lawsuits brought by U.S. regulators against two of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second biggest cryptocurrency, fell 0.42% to US$1,741 over the past 24 hours, bringing its weekly losses to 7.18%.\n\n\u201cLast week and the weekend were tumultuous days for cryptocurrency markets, marked by significant declines in valuations across the board,\u201d Robert Quartly-Janeiro, Chief Strategy Officer of crypto exchange Bitrue, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThe challenges faced by Binance and Coinbase in the United States hold significant weight. Binance, commanding over 60% of the global market, and Coinbase, with 70% market share in the USA, are major participants so what happens to them naturally affects global sentiment,\u201d Quartly-Janeiro added.\n\nBNB, the native token of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange Binance, gained 4.93% to US$246 over the past 24 hours. That reduced its weekly losses to 10.95%.\n\nThe gains came after a U.S. federal judge on Tuesday denied the SEC\u2019s request to freeze the assets of Binance.US. The decision allows Binance.US to continue operating while it battles a lawsuit filed against it by the regulator last week. The SEC alleges that Binance.US failed to register as a securities exchange while offering and selling unregistered securities.\n\nThe SEC also sued Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., on similar charges.\n\n\u201cOutflows from Coinbase and Binance reached US$4 billion during the week. Crypto traders, spooked by SEC lawsuits, are withdrawing assets from exchanges en masse,\u201d Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at online brokerage firm FxPro, said in emailed comments.\n\nIn a parallel development involving the SEC and crypto, Ripple\u2019s XRP token was the biggest loser, dropping 5.36% to US$0.5013 in 24 hours and 4.93% on the week. The drop came after the so-called \u201cHinman documents\u201d were released, named after former SEC corporate finance director William Hinman.\n\nRipple Labs Inc. was sued by the SEC in December 2020, for allegedly selling US$1.3 billion in unregistered securities. The company asked to unseal documents in which Hinman said Bitcoin and Ether should not be categorized as financial securities. The comments are a major point of contention in the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple as Ripple seeks to bolster its fair notice defense.\n\nRipple\u2019s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cHinman\u2019s speech should never again be invoked in any serious discussion about whether a token is or is not a security. Unelected bureaucrats must faithfully apply the law within the constraints of their jurisdiction.\u201d\n\n14/ And finally, Hinman\u2019s speech should never again be invoked in any serious discussion about whether a token is or is not a security. Unelected bureaucrats must faithfully apply the law within the constraints of their jurisdiction. They can\u2019t \u2013 as Hinman tried \u2013 create new law. \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 13, 2023\n\nMarkus Thielen, Head of Research & Strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, feels that the crypto crackdown by the U.S. SEC opens up new opportunities for other parts of the world including Asia.\n\n\u201cI think the key difference is that in the U.S., derivatives are not really offered; only the spot market. And the derivatives market is 11 times bigger than the spot market,\u201d Thielen told Bloomberg on June 13.\n\n\u201cSo a lot of the trading already happens outside of the U.S. and I think this is why Binance got into trouble because a lot of U.S. institutions appear to be trading on the platform according to the allegations. I think to really offset the pressure from the U.S., I think Hong Kong needs to do more and I think Hong Kong can actually step into this void now,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nEven in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which gained momentum after multiple centralized finance (CeFi) collapses throughout 2022, institutional investors are looking at Asia and the Middle East.\n\n\u201cGrowth is returning to DeFi, albeit slower than last year, but interest is coming back as institutions and investors evaluate the landscape,\u201d Robert Alcorn, chief executive and Co-Founder of DeFi credit marketplace Clearpool, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the main obstacle for traditional institutions remains regulatory clarity and compliance. Significant progress has been made in this regard across Asia and the Middle East, which is likely to encourage investor participation, and we expect these regions to become the main crypto lending hubs as confidence builds,\u201d Alcorn added.\n\nIn Asia, Hong Kong\u2019s new rules for the cryptocurrency industry came into effect from June 1, as part of the city\u2019s ambition to become a global hub for digital assets.\n\nThis week, Hong Kong-based Bank of China International Holdings (BOCI) issued US$28 million worth of fully digital structured notes in the form of tokens on Ethereum blockchain. That makes it the first Chinese financial institution to issue a tokenized security in Hong Kong, according to a statement from investment banking firm UBS.\n\nThe product was developed by UBS and is available to its clients in the Asia Pacific region.\n\n\u201cWorking together with UBS, we are driving the simplification of digital asset markets and products for customers in Asia Pacific through the development of blockchain-based digital structured products, designed specifically for customers in Asia Pacific,\u201d Ying Wang, deputy chief executive officer at BOCI, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the evolution of Hong Kong\u2019s digital economy and are committed to promoting the digital transformation and innovative development of Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry,\u201d Wang added.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization fell 0.46% to US$1.06 trillion, while total market volume gained 8.59% to US$31.3 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nNFT markets slump, Snoop Dogg releases collectibles\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.63% to 2,942.34 in the 24 hours to 6.45 p.m. in Hong Kong, registering losses of 10.43% over the last seven days.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite dropped 1.24% to 1,037.33, down 6.37% on the week.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is finally reacting to the U.S. SEC\u2019s stepped-up attacks against the cryptocurrency industry,\u201d according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cEither way, it\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019re entering another new phase of the NFT market, and traders are being cautious. How low we can go, nobody knows,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume on the Ethereum blockchain dropped 3.07% to US$13.09 million in 24 hours. In stark contrast, sales volume gained 95.59% to US$5.41 million on the Bitcoin network, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nSales of uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 Bitcoin NFTs that are not part of an established collection \u2013 recorded the highest sales volume in 24 hours, climbing 87.32% to US$3.10 million.\n\nAmong other developments in the sector, entertainment icon Snoop Dogg has launched The Snoop Dogg Passport Series, a digital tour collectible.

But with regulators targeting other tokens, bitcoin's dominance will to grow to 80%, he added.\n\n\"Now I think that the public is beginning to realize that bitcoin is the next bitcoin,\" Saylor said. \"The next logical step is for bitcoin to 10x from here and then 10x again.\"\n\nHe has been a long-time bitcoin bull, and his enterprise software company has bet heavily on the token, amassing a stockpile of about 140,000 bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission asserted new pressure onto the crypto scene earlier this month, charging top exchange Binance with 13 violations of US law. Alongside this, it sued rival crypto exchange Coinbase with a failure to register under the SEC.\n\nIn the SEC's view, tokens worth $120 billion are unregistered securities, making it illegal for the exchanges to offer them.\n\nIn its lawsuits, the regulator laid out 19 tokens under scrutiny. In response, other trading platforms such as Robinhood and eToro removed a number of them.\n\nThe industry has interpreted the regulatory moves as reaffirmation that bitcoin is not considered a security and won't fall under the crackdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I mean, their view is crypto exchanges should trade and hold pure digital commodities like bitcoin,\" Saylor said of the SEC. \"And so the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a bitcoin-focused industry, with maybe a half a dozen to a dozen other other proof-of-work tokens.\"\n\nSaylor's comments are an extension of his previous take at the end of May, when he said bitcoin had bottomed out and was at the start of a significant bull run.\n\nBitcoin is expected to receive another tailwind next year. The so-called halving, which is due next in April 2024, will cut in half the rate at which new coins are released as well as the reward given to miners for their work in processing transactions.\n\nIt's done to eventually cap the token's total supply at 21 million units and is considered bullish for the price."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is copying the prelude to its 2020 breakout to an \u201cinsane\u201d extent, the co-founders of Glassnode have said.\n\nIn a tweet on June 15, Yann Allemann and Jan Happel highlighted three BTC price metrics that are anything but bearish.\n\nMetrics echo Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmajor reversals and rallies\u201d\n\nBTC/USD reached local highs of $31,000 in April but, since then, has dipped around 20%. Sentiment has taken a beating in the process, with downward price predictions becoming the norm in the intervening weeks.\n\nWhile recent events have placed additional pressure on the market, Allemann and Happel see at least three good reasons for optimism.\n\nSeveral on-chain indicators, they revealed, now look uncannily like they did in Q3 2020, just before BTC/USD beat its old 2017 all-time high of $20,000.\n\n\u201cThe resemblance to Sep 04, 2020, is insane\u2026,\u201d they wrote in part of commentary.\n\nLeading the line-up is the classic relative strength index (RSI), which measures how overbought or oversold BTC/USD is at a specific price point.\n\nDaily RSI currently measures 35, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirms. This is its lowest reading since early March, just before Bitcoin\u2019s most recent uptick, which resulted in the $31,000 peak a month later.\n\n\u201cRSI is at levels that led to major reversals and rallies,\u201d the post explained.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart on Bitstamp with RSI. Source: TradingView\n\nContinuing, Allemann and Happel flagged the Cipher B readings for Bitcoin, these coming from a collection of algorithms that converge to offer signals of, among other things, when to buy dips during bull markets.\n\n\u201cCipher b wave trends are at levels that led to major reversals and rallies,\u201d they repeated.\n\nFinally, the appropriately named Bitcoin Risk Signal is back at its Sept. 4, 2020 position. Risk Signal predicts the likelihood of a major BTC price drawdown and, at that time, saw a spike to \u201chigh risk\u201d before receding.\n\nWhat happened next was a flat Risk Signal reading for successive months, while BTC/USD broke higher.\n\nBitcoin Risk Signal chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin's price has been pinned below $26,300 since June 10, reflecting a 14.8% correction in two months. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq tech stock market index gained 13.6% in the same period, indicating that investors are not exactly fleeing to the safety of cash and short-term debt. In fact, the demand for United States government bonds has been declining for the past six weeks.\n\nU.S. 2-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView\n\nThe yield on two-year U.S. Treasurys, for example, increased from 3.80% on May 4 to 4.68% on June 14. Lower demand for debt instruments increases payouts, resulting in a higher yield. If the investor thinks that inflation will continue above target, the tendency is for those participants to demand a higher yield when trading bonds.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury is set to issue more than $850 billion in new bills between June and September. As additional debt issuance tends to cause higher yields, the market expects increased borrowing costs for families and businesses. Still, that does not explain why investors have been flocking to tech companies but avoiding Bitcoin (BTC), as depicted by the past two-month performance.\n\nEight consecutive weeks of crypto fund outflows\n\nAccording to CoinShares' latest \u201cDigital Asset Fund Flows Report,\u201d the sector\u2019s investment product outflows amounted to $88 million in the week ending on June 10. The substantial drawdown added to the ongoing eight-week streak of outflows, which now total $417 million.\n\nThe eight-week cumulative outflows for Bitcoin reached $254 million, representing approximately 1.2% of the total assets under management. Analysts at CoinShares have attributed this trend to monetary policy considerations, as interest rate hikes show no signs of slowing down, prompting investors to remain cautious.\n\nBitcoin has been trying to reclaim the $27,500 support for the past two weeks, but that might be harder than expected given the upcoming $600 million weekly options expiry on June 16.\n\nA brief Bitcoin pump above $27,000 made bulls giddy\n\nIt is worth noting that the actual open interest for the options expiry will be lower since bulls concentrated their bets above $27,000. These traders likely got excessively optimistic after Bitcoin\u2019s price gained 8% on June 6, erasing the losses that drove BTC down to $25,400.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for June 16. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.73 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $350 million in call (buy) open interest and the $250 million in put (sell) options.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $26,000 at 8:00 am UTC on June 16, only $27 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin \u2018far larger\u2019 than Binance or Coinbase, says Jan3 CEO: BTC Prague 2023\n\nBulls need Bitcoin price at $26,500 to avoid a $100 million loss\n\nBelow are the three most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on June 16 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies depending on the expiry price.\n\nThe imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $24,000 and $25,000: 0 calls vs. 6,100 puts. Bears are in total control, profiting $145 million.\n\n0 calls vs. 6,100 puts. Bears are in total control, profiting $145 million. Between $25,000 and $26,500: 1,000 calls vs. 4,400 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $100 million.\n\n1,000 calls vs. 4,400 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $100 million. Between $26,500 and $27,000: 2,200 calls vs. 2,800 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put instruments.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. This oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nStill, traders should be cautious as the bears are currently in a better position for Friday\u2019s weekly options expiry, favoring negative price moves. Thus, an eventual sharp correction below $25,000 should not be discarded.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Ether, alongside all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, also dropped amid lawsuits by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against two of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. As widely expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday. However, the Fed warned of more rate rises to come later in the year as the central bank attempts to bring inflation down to its 2% target level.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong? Singapore? Tokyo? Seoul? Dubai? The race is on for the Web3 hub of Asia | Part 1\n\nBitcoin continues slide; SEC-targeted coins drop\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dropped 3.82% to US$24,909 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong. That brought its weekly losses to 5.80%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The dip took Bitcoin below US$25,000 for the first time in the week since the U.S. SEC filed lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase.\n\nEther, the second biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, lost 6.10% to US$1,635 in 24 hours, and has dropped 11.24% on the week. Ether dropped below US$1,700 on Thursday afternoon in Asia for the first time since March 17 when it stood at US$1,667.13.\n\nSolana, Cardano and Polygon \u2013 the top three cryptocurrencies named as securities by the U.S. SEC in its lawsuits against both Binance.US and Coinbase \u2013 each dropped more than 20% over the past week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA token lost 5.76% to US$0.2561 in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization was also down 7.10% in the last 24 hours to US$8.88 billion. On June 5 \u2014 the day the SEC filed a legal complaint against Binance.US claiming crypto tokens including ADA, Solana and Polygon\u2019s Matic are securities requiring registration and regulation \u2014 that figure stood at US$13.02 billion.\n\nSolana dropped 1.87% in the past 24 hours to US$14.78.

Its market cap lost 5.92% to US$5.70 billion in that period, down from US$8.01 billion on June 5.\n\n\u201cThe status of individual cryptocurrencies has led some exchanges in specific markets to contemplate delisting some of the larger and widely followed altcoins such as ADA, SOL, and MATIC,\u201d said Robert Quartly-Janeiro, Chief Strategy Officer of crypto exchange Bitrue, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cWhat sets the current situation apart is the regulatory focus shifting from market-providing exchanges to scrutinizing individual altcoins: that\u2019s a step change. In raw numbers, the affected coins have experienced bearish performances, with Cardano dropping by 24%, Solana down by 28%, and Polygon shedding 27% in the past week. Other altcoins witnessed similar declines,\u201d Quartly-Janeiro added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the losers in the crypto top 10. It fell 6.45% in 24 hours to US$0.4697, posting a weekly loss of 9.87%.\n\nThose losses came despite the release of the so-called \u201cHinman documents\u201d this week. The documents suggests that cryptocurrencies liker Ether are not in fact securities, as claimed by the SEC. Its release was therefore widely expected to prove favorable for Ripple in its own ongoing legal battle with the regulator, which began December 2020.\n\nBNB, the native token of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance \u2014 whose U.S. operations are now the target of the SEC\u2019s regulatory clampdown \u2014 lost 4.49% in the 24 hours to US$235.83, and is down 9.66% on the week.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization dropped 3.53% to US$1.02 trillion, while total crypto market volume gained 22.04% to US$38.21 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nNFT sales drop; Sotheby\u2019s to host auction in New York\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.88% to 2,904.24 in the past 24 hours, after losing 10.77% in the last seven days.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite also dropped 1.04% to 1,029.13, and is down 6.73% on the week. Similarly, sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, dived 6.77% to US$13.47 million over the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club topped sales by collection in the past 24 hours, rising 95.90% to US$1.32 million. But, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, trading in the market is now so thin that little can be read into even such a large swing.\n\n\u201cIn general, volume is just so low, so on any given day it can be up or down a big percentage just from typical trading,\u201d he explained.\n\nAmong other developments in the industry, Sotheby\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest art auctioneer, will host Grails: Part II, a live digital art auction in New York, on Thursday. The auction will feature some of the most renowned generative artists in the NFT space. As much as US$10 million is expected to change hands over the course of the auction. Featured artists will include Art Blocks founder Snowfro, Tyler Hobbs, creator of Fidenzas, and Dmitri Cherniak, creator of Ringers.\n\n\u201cThe holy grail is the Ringers #879 (The Goose) by Dmitri Cherniak that is rumored to have bidders willing to pay well over the projected US$1-3 million sale price,\u201d Petscher said about the auction.\n\nElsewhere, SuperRare, a curated NFT marketplace for digital artworks, has introduced \u201cFragments of The Dreams: A Surrealist Vision,\u201d a new exhibition that showcases a collection of surrealist photography from SuperRare artists including Ben Zank, Brooke DiDonato, and Cowboy Killer.\n\nFounded in 2018, SuperRare has recorded over US$300 million in total sales and over US$180 million earned by artists to date, according to an emailed statement by the public relations spokesperson for the company.\n\nMeanwhile, Be., a subsidiary of Animoca Brands, and the Australian Football League (AFL) has announced the Throwbacks series. The group of AFL collectible NFTs feature well-known moments from the sport\u2019s past, highlights, and player profiles.\n\nSimilarly, Mocaverse, the Animoca Brands membership NFT collection, has partnered with Rarible, an NFT platform for creators and brands, to launch Mocaverse Marketplace. The Mocaverse Marketplace will offer 0% platform fees on native listings of its collection to the Mocaverse community, the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nAsian equities rise; European bourses, U.S. futures drop\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equities mostly rose on Thursday, after the People\u2019s Bank of China lowered medium term lending rates to some financial institutions. The central bank reduced roughly US$33.1 billion worth of one-year medium-term loans by 10 basis points to 2.65% from 2.75%..\n\nThe Shanghai Composite gained 0.74% and the Shenzhen Component Index rose 1.81%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index rose 2.17% but Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell slightly by 0.05%.\n\nU.S. stock futures dropped as of 8.30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.16%, and S&P 500 futures lost 0.36%. Nasdaq 100 Futures also dropped 0.66%.\n\nU.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.3% month-on-month in May, after a 0.4% increase in April, beating the expected 0.1% decline.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept its interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% but signaled it may raise rates later in the year.\n\n\u201cBoth core and headline inflation are coming down, but core is still pretty high. The target of 2% is still way off,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cAnd the Fed is obsessing over the tightness of the labor market as, despite the 15-month-long inflation battle, unemployment is still near record lows. As such, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if rates were hiked to 6% by the end of 2023,\u201d Green added.\n\nThe European Central Bank raised interest rates by an expected 25 basis points on Thursday to 3.5%, the highest rate since the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 dropped 0.59% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 lost 0.86% during afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\n\u201cWith inflation coming back as a key threat, coupled with the Fed\u2019s focus now firmly on bringing inflation back to the 2% target, the case for including commodities in portfolios grows stronger,\u201d Oliver Taylor, multi-asset fund manager, and Joven Lee, multi-asset strategist, at Schroders, said in a note on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMulti-asset investors should re-consider commodities as a strategic holding in portfolios. An arbitrary 10% allocation to commodities could provide a pickup of ~0.3% expected returns for portfolios with 10% expected volatility,\u201d Taylor and Lee added."

Ethereum, meanwhile, fell to $1,636, down nearly 6% from Wednesday's levels.\n\nThe slump came shortly after the Fed kept interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting, but signaled that more interest rate hikes could come later this year as central bankers continue to wage war against inflation.\n\nThe central bank's dot-plot of projected rate moves and Chairman Jerome Powell's \"hawkish pause\" spooked traders, who had been thinking going into the meeting that the Fed could be about to signal its rate-hike campaign was over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarkets are currently pricing in a 65% chance that the Fed will raise rates another 25 basis-points in July.\n\nTighter monetary policy is adding to pressures being exerted by regulators, with bitcoin and ethereum prices stumbling as the Securities and Exchange Commission looks to police the sector more tightly.\n\nBinance and Coinbase were sued this month by the SEC. The regulator's complaint states that both firms are operating illegally in the US and that they have broken rules by offering their customers unregulated securities.\n\nThe suits are part of the SEC's siege against the wider crypto industry, Binance said in a statement last week while denying the allegations. Experts told Insider that the lawsuits could set a precedent for how crypto firms are treated in the US, potentially leading to an existential crisis for the crypto industry at large."

And so the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a bitcoin-focused industry with maybe half a dozen to a dozen other proof of work tokens.\"\n\nLast week, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, the two largest crypto exchanges by market cap. A total of 19 tokens have been mentioned in the filings. Bitcoin isn't one of them. Previously, SEC chair Gary Gensler has said that bitcoin (BTC) is a commodity.\n\nSaylor's MicroStrategy began buying bitcoin in 2020 while calling the cryptocurrency a million times better store of value than gold. The company now holds approximately 140,000 bitcoin worth about $4 billion. In March 2023, Saylor lost a bid to dismiss claims that he failed to pay personal income taxes, interest and penalties due for Washington, D.C. However, the court dismissed claims that Saylor and MicroStrategy had conspired to violate the law.\n\nRegulatory clarity is going to drive #Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion & anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors.

He said the \"next logical step\" is for bitcoin to multiply 10 times in value to $250,000.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Eventually, I have confidence that the crypto exchanges will come around to realising that bitcoin really is the dominant asset in this space, and their business models are fine when bitcoin goes up by a factor of 10,\" Saylor said.\n\nRead More: MicroStrategy Founder Michael Saylor Loses Court Bid to Dismiss DC Tax Evasion Claims\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The crypto lender filed its reorganization plan on June 15.\n\nUnder the revised plan, Celsius will convert all altcoins from customers, with the exception of \u201cCustody and Withhold accounts,\u201d to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) starting from July 1.\n\nCelsius will be selling all altcoins from all customers (except Custody and Withhold accounts) starting July 1st and will be converting them into Bitcoin and Ethereum. \u2014 Celsians (@CelsiansNetwork) June 15, 2023\n\nThe new reorganization plan proposes to deal with the claims of retail borrowers through the set off treatment. The term \u201cset off treatment\u201d refers to comparing losses against profits in a given year. Losses that are not offset against income can be carried over and offset against income in later years. A Twitter user explained how the set off treatment would work for borrowers depending on the portion of the loan they have returned:\n\nIn your example, the customer took a $25k loan secured by 2 #BTC \u2014 let\u2019s say the customer has paid 20% back and thus has $20k outstanding principal.\n\n\n\nIf the set-off counts the BTC at 7/13/22 prices, the collateral would be valued at about $40k.\n\n\n\nSubtract the $20k principal from\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZCKC1xYegm \u2014 Cam Crews (@camcrews) June 10, 2023\n\nDavid Adler from the law firm McCarter & English tweeted that the restructuring proposal by Celsius could face opposition from the borrowers. He noted that the debtor (Celsius) is demanding repayment of the loans, yet it has no intention of fulfilling its contractual obligations, such as returning the collateral to the borrowers. This could be something borrowers would object to, he added.\n\n\u201cThis proposed \u2018treatment\u2019 violates every consumer lending law out there (state, federal) and the ad hoc Borrower group will be opposing this plan.\u201c\n\nAdditionally, Celsius has asked permission to appoint Chris Ferraro as the foreign representative in connection with a British court\u2019s Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations in the United Kingdom. In this way, the company\u2019s U.K. assets would be safeguarded, and the United States Chapter 11 would be acknowledged as the \u201cforeign main proceedings\u201d to organize a global resolution.\n\nRelated: Celsius adds over 428K stETH to Lido\u2019s lengthening withdrawal queue\n\nOn May 25, the Fahrenheit crypto consortium, which comprises venture capital firm Arrington Capital and miner US Bitcoin Corp, won the bid to acquire Celsius assets. At the time, Celsius assets were estimated to be worth roughly $2 billion. Under the new deal, the new company is expected to receive about $450\u2013500 million worth of liquid cryptocurrency, while US Bitcoin Corp plans to construct a 100-megawatt Bitcoin (BTC) mining plant.\n\nCelsius paused withdrawals on June 13, 2022, after the firm became entangled in bad investments and crypto contagion following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.\n\nMagazine: Tiffany Fong flames Celsius, FTX and NY Post: Hall of Flame"

It is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $26,063 swing high to the $24,818 low.\n\nBitcoin price is now trading below $25,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Immediate resistance is near the $25,200 level.\n\nSource: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe first major resistance is near the $25,500 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $26,063 swing high to the $24,818 low. A clear move above the $25,500 resistance might start a fresh increase. The next major resistance is near the $26,000 level, above which the bulls might send BTC toward the $26,500 resistance zone.\n\nMore Losses in BTC?\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price fails to clear the $25,500 resistance, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $24,800 level and the recent low.\n\nThe next major support is near the $24,500 level, below which the price might gain bearish momentum.

        "title": "Bitcoin 'far larger' than Binance or Coinbase, says Jan3 CEO: BTC Prague 2023 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Amid the panic over lawsuits against major cryptocurrency exchanges, one Bitcoin (BTC) advocate argued that the BTC market is much bigger than the one tracked by exchanges.\n\nThe total Bitcoin market is not limited to Binance, Coinbase or any other crypto exchange, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow told Cointelegraph at the BTC Prague 2023 conference on June 9.\n\n\u201cWhereas I think for Bitcoin, it\u2019s much harder to quantify how much of the market it is. It\u2019s because a lot of Bitcoin trades are block trades,\u201d Mow said.\n\nIn mentioning Bitcoin block trades, Mow referred to private trading channels that allow investors to privately negotiate and proceed with large BTC buy or sell orders. Some of the channels include peer-to-peer (P2P) or over-the-counter (OTC) deals, he noted, adding:\n\n\u201cYou kind of have this black box around Bitcoin. You don\u2019t really know how much the market is total. If Bitcoin functions as P2P, you\u2019re not going to quantifiably measure how much Bitcoin is traded.\u201d\n\nPrivate Bitcoin trading channels like P2P or OTC are not included in total BTC trading volumes on major crypto tracking websites like CoinGecko. That means Bitcoin\u2019s daily trading volume is more extensive than the $9.6 billion recorded at the time of writing.\n\n\u201cCoinGecko only tracks trades happening on crypto exchanges and does not track trades happening on P2P platforms and brokerages,\u201d CoinGecko co-founder and chief operating officer Bobby Ong told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cP2P platforms include places such as Binance P2P, Huobi P2P, Paxful, Remitano and so on,\u201d the executive noted. CoinGecko has no plans to track such platforms in the near future, Ong added.\n\nRelated: Binance.US halts trading for dozens of USDT, BTC, BUSD pairs amid SEC lawsuit\n\nApart from P2P, CoinGecko also doesn\u2019t record institutional trades on OTC, Ong said, adding:\n\n\u201cInstitutional trades that happen on exchanges that we track are recorded. OTC trades are not recorded as it\u2019s like a P2P trade but between large entities.\u201d\n\nThe new remarks from the Jan3 CEO may imply that cryptocurrency exchange moguls like Binance or Coinbase might not dominate the Bitcoin market as much as some think.\n\nIn January 2023, the Norwegian crypto research firm K33 Research \u2014 formerly Arcane Research \u2014 said that Binance handled 92% of the Bitcoin spot market in 2022. \u201cNo matter how you look at it in terms of trading activity, Binance is the crypto market,\u201d the firm wrote at the time.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether retreat; BNB leads gainers, top 10 crypto mixed - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Wednesday morning trading in Asia, remaining stuck under the US$26,000 resistance line. Ether also lost ground, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were mixed. The BNB token of the Binance crypto exchange marked the biggest gains among the top 10 after a U.S. court denied the financial regulator\u2019s request to freeze the assets of the Binance.US exchange.\n\nFear & Greed\n\nBitcoin fell 0.38% over the last 24 hours to US$25,835.15 at 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 4.87% in the last week and repeatedly failing to break through resistance at US$26,000 following the lawsuits filed last week against U.S. crypto trading platforms by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nEther dipped 0.49% to US$1,734.63, posting a 7.87%% loss for the week.\n\nBitcoin is struggling to move above $26,000 because of the fear in the crypto market and despite the optimism in equities, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at online brokerage firm FxPro said in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cThe cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index is in the Fear territory at 45 (-2 points overnight), whereas the Fear & Greed index for the stock market is at 79 (extreme greed),\u201d Kuptsikevich noted. \u201cTechnically, to break the downtrend, Bitcoin needs to overcome $27K, and a drop below $26.5K is required to confirm the downtrend. The second scenario seems more likely.\u201d\n\nOther top 10 cryptocurrencies were mixed. Binance\u2019s BNB token led winners with 4.67% rise to US$241.36, reducing its weekly loss to 14.41%.\n\nThe BNB gains came after a U.S. federal judge on Tuesday denied the SEC request for a temporary restraining order that would have frozen the assets of Binance.US, the U.S. arm of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision allows Binance.US to continue operating while it negotiates with the SEC over its compliance with securities laws. Last week, the federal agency accused Binance.US of failing to register as a securities exchange and of offering and selling unregistered securities. The SEC also filed a lawsuit against the U.S.-based Coinbase exchange. Both exchanges have rejected the allegations.\n\n\u201cAccording to CryptoQuant, bitcoin reserves on US crypto exchanges have fallen below the 50% \u2013 levels last seen in 2017. Assets are flowing to overseas exchanges due to regulatory uncertainty and recent SEC actions against Binance and Coinbase,\u201d said Kuptsikevich.\n\nIn other developments involving the SEC and crypto, Ripple\u2019s XRP token lost 0.87% to US$0.5197 for a weekly decline of 2.25% after Tuesday\u2019s long-awaited unveiling of the so-called \u201cHinman documents,\u201d named after former SEC corporate finance director William Hinman.\n\nRipple Labs Inc. was sued by the SEC in December 2020, which alleged XRP was offered and sold as an unregistered security. The company had sought the unsealing of the documents which reveal that Hinman said Bitcoin and Ether should not be categorized as financial securities. The comments are a major point of argument between the SEC and Ripple as Ripple seeks to bolster its fair notice defense.\n\nRipple\u2019s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty wrote on Twitter Tuesday that the documents show: \u201cHinman ignored multiple warnings that his speech contained made-up analysis with no basis in law\u201d and showed the SEC flip-flopped and overstepped the boundaries of its jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cUnelected bureaucrats must faithfully apply the law within the constraints of their jurisdiction. They can\u2019t \u2013 as Hinman tried \u2013 create new law,\u201d Alderoty said.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap lost 0.12% to US$1.054 trillion in the last 24 hours, while daily trading volume increased by 10.62% to US$33.75 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT market on downtrend\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 1.76% to 2,919.17 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.92% for the week.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT index is now down nearly 11% in seven days as we continue to find new lows,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThinking about what it will take to recover seems pretty daunting, as traders are pretty unsure that a recovery will even mean existing assets regain value. History tells us that it\u2019s new projects that a majority of investors\u2019 funds will go into.\u201d\n\nTotal NFT buy/sell transactions rose 3.42% to US$22.1 million, but sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, fell 3.94% over the last 24 hours to US$12.87 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThe Bitcoin network was the second largest NFT network in terms of buy/sell transactions, jumping 76.67% to US$3.8 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nTransactions of Uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 rose 69.42% to US$1.39 million.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club sales gained 25.14% to US$1.3 million.\n\n\u201cArt is still hot, with multiple Fidenzas selling for six figures recently and plenty of hype leading up to the Sotheby\u2019s grails auctions coming this week,\u201d Petscher added. Fidenza refers to a collection of 999 NFTs created by the artist Tyler Hobbs using computer algorithms.\n\nSotheby\u2019s is auctioning the Grails digital art collection on Wednesday. The collection consists of NFT artwork that belongs to the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and its NFT-purchasing fund Starry Night Capital.\n\nU.S. stock futures mixed\n\nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell (Left), Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler (Right) | Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were mixed as of 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong after equities gained for the fourth consecutive day during regular trading on Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.24%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.034% lower while Nasdaq Futures gained 0.028%.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s regular trading, the Dow climbed 0.43%. The S&P 500 added 0.69%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.83%.\n\nTuesday\u2019s U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that inflation grew at a 4% annual rate in May, compared to 4.9% in April. The CPI was the lowest yearly inflation rate since March 2021, leaving investors hopeful for a pause in the Federal Reserve\u2019s run of interest rate hikes to curb price inflation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a feel-good headline figure that will cheer investors as it will add further pressure on the Fed to pause its interest rate hike agenda,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. central bank is now 15 months and 10 consecutive rate increases into its battle to cool red-hot inflation, but markets will be expecting that the latest CPI report will now be enough to convince officials to hit the pause button,\u201d Green said.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged when it meets on Wednesday, according to TradingEconomics. U.S. rates are at 5% to 5.25%, the highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 94.2% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at this week\u2019s meeting, up from 80.4% the previous day.\n\nHowever, Green of deVere Group warned of more hikes this year \u2014 \u201cInflation is certainly coming down so far, but it is very, very gradual. It remains sticky and a long way from the 2% target, largely due to a tight labor market.\u201d\n\nFormer Fed vice chair Roger Ferguson also told CNBC last Friday that the central bank may raise rates later in the year even if it skips this time.\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty level rose 2.18% on Wednesday to an all-time high. The level changes every two weeks and measures the additional computing power a miner has to use to verify transactions on a block. A higher difficulty indicates it is more competitive to mine Bitcoin, reducing profit. The network\u2019s hashrate also increased to a record high.\n\nSee related article: What\u2019s next for crypto miners after US debt ceiling deal?\n\nFast facts\n\nThe mining difficulty reading came in at 52.35 trillion at block height 794,304 in Wednesday\u2019s adjustment. That follows a 3.4% rise in the previous adjustment on June 1, according to data from BTC.com.\n\nThe difficulty of mining Bitcoin typically rises when more miners are active, which increases the competition for rewards in Bitcoin in return for validating transactions on the network. The higher the difficulty, the less chance a miner has to secure an entire block on the chain, which in turn can reduce a miner\u2019s profitability.\n\nMining difficulty adjustments are correlated to changes in hashrate, the level of computing power used for mining.\n\n\u201cIn short, difficulty follows hashrate up or down, and hashrate is driven by the overall profitability of building and operating bitcoin data centers,\u201d Andrew Webber, chief of Digital Power Optimization that works with power producers to deploy Bitcoin mining operations, told Forkast in an emailed response earlier this month. \u201cIf Bitcoin spot price goes higher, it means larger profits for miners.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hashrate was at around 392.6 exahashes per second on Wednesday, an increase from the 375.4 exahashes recorded during the previous adjustment on June 1, data from Blockchain.com shows.\n\nBitcoin fell 3.63% to US$25,045 in the last 24 hours to 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, but it was up about 51% so far this year, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lost 5.01% in value over the past seven days.\n\nSee related article: Tether stablecoin issuer taps Uruguay for Bitcoin mining using renewable energy"

        "content": "REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--OnChainMonkey (OCM) has announced the launch of its next NFT collection, OCM Dimensions. This significant milestone brings together art, engineering, technology, and innovation to enshrine a historic first-of-its-kind generative art collection on Bitcoin. Crafted entirely from code, OCM Dimensions showcases a groundbreaking way high-quality art can be inscribed on Bitcoin while using limited block space, a challenge that others have not overcome.\n\nThese iconic designs offer a stunning view of code on each satoshi, with detailed renderings of lighting, movement, and vibrancy. These NFTs are designed specifically for Bitcoin, as they are inscribed on satoshis from January 2009 (the month Bitcoin went live). Meticulously crafted by Metagood\u2019s world-class art and engineering team, the OCM Dimensions NFTs are 3-dimensional, interactive, and dynamic, and the inscription technology used to generate them on-chain will set the standard for generative art on Bitcoin. Crafted entirely from code, OCM Dimensions showcases a groundbreaking way high-quality art can be inscribed on Bitcoin while using limited block space, a challenge that others have not overcome.\n\nBy bringing this groundbreaking collection to the Bitcoin blockchain, OnChainMonkey solidifies the platform as the undisputed home for high-value digital assets, offering groundbreaking artistic expression and true digital ownership.\n\n\"Metagood's vision for the OnChainMonkey community and the entire OCM project is to create a prosperous global nation that prioritizes financial enrichment, physical health, social connection, and purposeful impact,\u201d said Danny Yang, co-founder and CEO of Metagood, the company behind the OnChainMonkey collection. \"Our latest collection offers community members the opportunity to become early adopters of not only historic, high-quality Bitcoin NFTs, but also the most efficiently inscribed Bitcoin NFTs available today.\"\n\nOCM Dimensions is one of the first 3D NFT collections on Bitcoin and demonstrates that these engaging pieces can be issued in an efficient way that does not impact the performance of the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin users will not be affected by the launch given our efficient way of inscribing. However, bitcoin HODLERs and miners will benefit from the launch of OCM Dimensions, as it secures even more high-value assets onto the increasingly valuable Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMetagood, the creator of the OnChainMonkey collection, is a consistent leader in NFT technological innovation. Its first collection, OCM Genesis, minted the entire 10,000-strong collection on the Ethereum blockchain in a single transaction. This had never been done before and marked a milestone in NFT scalability. In February 2023, the OCM Genesis collection became the first-ever 10,000 PFP (profile picture) collection to also be inscribed on Bitcoin. In April 2023, Metagood partnered with Asprey Studio on the upcoming Asprey Bugatti Egg Collection. Metagood will be the digital asset partner inscribing digital counterparts of their luxury objets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Once again, OnChainMonkey and its partner company Metagood are revolutionizing NFTs with their groundbreaking OCM Dimensions collection, which will become the world-first 3D NFT collection to be fully inscribed on-chain on the Bitcoin network. The collection will utilize the Ordinals protocol.\n\nThe first 300 OCM Dimensions will be minted directly on Bitcoin, then the remaining collection (up to 2,000) will be minted on Bitcoin via burnable Ethereum NFTs that the first OCM Genesis NFT collection can consume over time to generate its respective OCM Dimensions on Bitcoin. Hiro Wallet and Xverse are official wallet partners of the collection.\n\nOnChainMonkey will soon be announcing an amazing new collection with the generative artist, Alexis Andr\u00e9.\n\nTo learn more about the OCM Dimensions collection, click here.\n\nAbout OnChainMonkey\n\nLaunched by the NFT company Metagood, OnChainMonkey is the first non-fungible token (NFT) profile picture collection created on-chain in a single transaction on Ethereum.

        "title": "A beginner's guide to Satoshi: The smallest unit of Bitcoin - OKX",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency to ever be created, and is now the largest by market cap. You can find it on almost any digital currency exchange. While Bitcoin was intended to act as a currency, its technological flaws make it better suited to be an investment asset. The problem with this is that 1 BTC costs a lot of money, therefore very few people can afford to buy a whole Bitcoin.\n\nLuckily, they don\u2019t have to, as Bitcoin can be broken down into smaller units. Similar to how the US dollar has a cent, Bitcoin has a satoshi \u2014 its smallest unit. This guide will tell you everything there is to know about them.\n\nWhat is a satoshi?\n\nA satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. It represents one-hundred-millionth of 1 BTC, and it was named after the mysterious creator of the Bitcoin protocol, Satoshi Nakamoto. Obviously, when Bitcoin first appeared, it didn\u2019t have the need for a smaller denomination of its currency. In the early days of Bitcoin, the price of BTC was measured in cents. However, these days, when each BTC costs thousands of dollars, it is very useful to divide it into satoshis.\n\nFortunately, even with Bitcoin\u2019s massive price appreciation, satoshis are still very affordable for crypto users. In fact, even if BTC price reached $1 million per coin, 1 satoshi would still only cost $0.01. Whether or not Bitcoin can or will ever reach that height remains to be seen.\n\nBut, the fact remains that a whole Bitcoin is still too expensive for the majority of traders. Because of that, satoshis come in quite handy, as they allow everyone to still use portions of BTC. Otherwise, Bitcoin would simply not be affordable for anyone other than the wealthy and institutional investors.\n\nHistory of satoshi\n\nThe history of satoshi starts with Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin Protocol itself. Back in 2008, when the world was struck with a financial crisis, an unknown entity called Satoshi Nakamoto emerged. To this day, it is unknown if Nakamoto was an individual, a group, a company, or something else entirely.\n\nHowever, on October 31st, 2008, Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper. This was the document that presented a decentralized network running on blockchain technology. It introduced Bitcoin as its digital currency, establishing all aspects of the project.\n\nSeveral months later, on January 3rd, 2009, Nakamoto mined Bitcoin\u2019s Genesis Block. This was, and still is, the first block in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. He created BTC so that it can be divided into smaller units. The smallest unit is one hundred millionth of 1 BTC. This unit was then named satoshi, in honor of Bitcoin\u2019s creator.\n\nThe name \u00a8satoshi\u00a8 was actually first mentioned by ribuck, a member of the BitcoinTalk forum. The user first proposed this on November 15th, 2010. Ribuck\u2019s initial idea was to use this name for one-hundredth of a BTC. However, later, he changed his mind, proposing to use the name for the smallest unit. Other members of the forum agreed, and started using the name.\n\nHow does the satoshi work?\n\nGiven that a satoshi is just a small amount of Bitcoin, it behaves exactly like BTC. It runs on Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network, and can be used for bitcoin transactions, payments, trading, and alike. Sometimes, people don\u2019t even use the name satoshi, but instead they say the amount in BTC.\n\nFor example, if you were to buy $250 worth of BTC, you can say that in two ways. You can refer to it as 0.00912295 BTC (based on the price at the time of writing). Alternatively, you can just say 912,295 satoshis. It means the same thing, and it is entirely up to the user to choose how to explain this amount. On exchanges, you will have to type it as the value of Bitcoin, since satoshi is not officially supported.\n\nHow can you use satoshis?\n\nSince a satoshi is Bitcoin, only of a different denomination, you can use them interchangeably. Satoshis do not have any advantages or flaws in comparison to BTC. The only advantage comes from the fact that a satoshi is more affordable. A whole Bitcoin is too expensive for most traders, investors, or people who use BTC for payments.\n\nAs for the actual use cases for satoshis, they can include the following:\n\nBuying and selling on nearly any digital currency exchange\n\nTrading it for other cryptocurrencies\n\nBuying products or paying for services where Bitcoin is accepted\n\nSpeculative investing\n\nBuying satoshis is also very simple. All you need to do is go to any crypto exchange, and purchase any amount of Bitcoin. To refer to our example, by buying BTC for $250, you will own 0.00912295 BTC or 912,295 satoshis. Satoshi in Bitcoin and US dollar Let's compare it to BTC and US dollars to make it easy to understand how much a satoshi is worth.\n\n1 BTC consists of 100,000,000 satoshis, and it costs $27,378 at the time of writing\n\n1 satoshi represents 0.00000001 BTC\n\nIn US dollars, the value of 1 satoshi is $0.00027\n\n$1 is (currently) worth 0.00003653 BTC, or 3,653 satoshis\n\n$10 is (currently) worth 36,526 satoshis, and $100 is worth 365,255 satoshis\n\n1 million satoshis is the same as 0.01 BTC, and is (currently) worth around $273\n\nNote that the price of Bitcoin changes constantly, which means that the dollar value of satoshi does too. In other words, 1 BTC will always be equal to 100,000,000 satoshis. However, the two will not always have the same value in USD or other fiat currencies.\n\nHow does satoshi differ from other digital denominations?\n\nMany currencies, crypto and fiat, use denominations to break down the value of the base currency. In crypto, the denominations are specific to the preferences of the cryptocurrency\u2019s designer. Bitcoin uses satoshis, as we have established. Ethereum, on the other hand, has several denominations of its own. It\u2019s similar to the penny, nickel, dime, and quarter\n\nThis makes it easier for users to trade amounts that do not require a full coin/token. Of course, their differences could be confusing for new investors, who have yet to get used to smaller denominations.\n\nWhen it comes to fractions of Bitcoin, there are several denominations to consider, including:\n\n1 satoshi, which is 0.00000001 BTC\n\n100 satoshi, called microbitcoin (\u00b5BTC), which is 0.000001 BTC\n\n100,000 satoshi, called millibitcoin (mBTC), which is 0.001 BTC\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, we have wei, which is the smallest unit of Ether.\n\n1 wei = 0.000000001 Gwei = 0.000000000000000001 ETH\n\n1,000,000,000 wei = 1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH\n\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei = 1000000000 Gwei = 1 ETH\n\nLegacy of Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin after the financial crisis of 2008, when the banks once again failed their users. To Nakamoto, they have proven that they could not be trusted with money, so he created a decentralized system. This was supposed to be an alternative for fiat currency and banking systems. Today, Bitcoin is growing into something more than just a currency. However, thanks to its design and code, it can still be used as a currency.\n\nBut, since 1 BTC is extremely expensive today, and most people cannot afford it, we turn to satoshis. The smallest unit of BTC is still affordable, being only a fraction of a cent. As of 2023, it\u2019s been over 12 years since Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared. However, his invention is still alive and conquering the world as we speak. It even kickstarted a massive industry that is growing larger and more disruptive every year. As such, BTC, as well as Satoshi, represent Nakamoto\u2019s legacy. And, with that being the case, it is quite appropriate that his name is being used for Bitcoin\u2019s smaller units.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat does satoshi mean?\n\nSatoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, representing 0.00000001 BTC. Each Bitcoin contains 100 million satoshis. This ensures that anyone can purchase any amount of Bitcoin, regardless of their budget.\n\nHow many dollars is 1 satoshi?\n\nAccording to the BTC price at the time of writing, 1 satoshi equals $0.00027. Note that, just like Bitcoin, satoshi value changes over time. This means that satoshi will not keep this value indefinitely, it will grow or drop with the market.\n\nHow many is 1000 satoshi?\n\nAs of May 2023, 1000 satoshis is worth $0.27, or 0.00001 BTC. Once again, satoshi\u2019s value changes alongside Bitcoin. 1,000 satoshis will always be worth 0.00001 BTC, but its USD value is as volatile as Bitcoin\u2019s."

        "content": "How to Buy and Sell Bitcoin in India?\n\nRegulatory concerns are not to be taken lightly, and India is no different: for example, the Indian government has said that Bitcoin can\u2019t be used as a part of the payments system. However, nobody expressly forbid people from trading in\u2026\n\nRegulatory concerns are not to be taken lightly, and India is no different: for example, the Indian government has said that Bitcoin can\u2019t be used as a part of the payments system. However, nobody expressly forbids people from trading in cryptocurrencies, as long as they\u2019re not treated as legal tender.\n\nThanks to all the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies lately, understanding how to buy and sell Bitcoin in India is critical for everyone who wants to take part in it.\n\nThere are several ways to buy, sell, or spend Bitcoin in India:\n\nOn a local or international exchange (read more about choosing one here)\n\nBy finding a local dealer on a marketplace like Localbitcoins.com and buying bitcoins from them with cash, credit card, via PayPal, etc.\n\nBy buying or selling goods or services for bitcoins.\n\nIf you would like to buy Bitcoin with cash, this can also be done by visiting the nearest Bitcoin ATM. However, at the moment there are no Bitcoin ATMs operating in India (according to CoinATMRadar.com).\n\nHow to buy or sell bitcoin in India using an exchange\n\nUsing a cryptocurrency exchange is one of the most popular and convenient ways to buy and sell bitcoin. However, due to bank-imposed (RBI) restrictions, you might not be able to fund your crypto exchange account using Indian banks. The situation has significantly affected the country\u2019s crypto landscape, even forcing to shut down some native cryptocurrency exchanges. Despite the RBI crackdown, it is still possible to buy and sell bitcoins in India.\n\nUncoin exchange in India.\n\nThe leading Indian Bitcoin exchanges are Bitbns, WazirX,Unocoin, and Koinex. Unfortunately, Unocoin does not allow for INR deposits and withdrawals at the moment, but it is possible if you use Koinex and Bitbns.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to use Bitbns, you will need to verify your account with Aadhar and PAN card to connect your bank account and deposit or withdraw cash to/from your Bitbns wallet. With Koinex, all you need to do is register on the exchange, verify your account and fund it via Loop \u2013 an Indian platform for P2P INR trades.\n\nOnce you have bitcoin, you can also use other international exchanges to trade it or sell it. The most popular ones include:\n\nBuy or sell bitcoin in India via peer-to-peer platforms (P2P)\n\nNot every bitcoin user is satisfied with the level of anonymity and security provided by online crypto exchanges. Despite their convenience, bitcoin trading remains largely popular in the peer-to-peer platforms, as they tend to offer their users more in terms of privacy and freedom.\n\nLocalBitcoins trading volume in India. Source: Coin.dance\n\nThe most popular P2P platform is LocalBitcoins. It serves as a local advertisement board for everyone who wants to buy and sell bitcoin. Once you register on the platform, you post an ad or search for local people/institutions who want to buy or sell bitcoins via your preferred methods and for your preferred price. Once you find a suitable buyer/seller, you agree on the terms of the transaction (bank transfer, Paypal, face-to-face meeting, cash, etc.). Note that not every seller is trustworthy, so be sure to check their history and reviews beforehand.\n\nPaxful trading volume in India. Source: Coin.dance\n\nPaxful is another alternative to LocalBitcoins. It works in a similar manner.\n\nBesides LocalBitcoins and Paxful, you can try decentralized P2P Bitcoin exchanges like Bisq and Cryptonex.\n\nBisq decentralizing trading platform.\n\nBisq stands out from other exchanges mentioned above, as it is a decentralized crypto exchange that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies (including bitcoin) without registration.\n\nCryptonex is another P2P crypto platform that lets you instantly exchange cryptocurrencies, INR, and other currencies using your credit/debit card. However, unlike Bisq, the service is not anonymous, and the onboarding process plus KYC/AML verification takes more time.\n\nLast but not least, you can try to buy and sell bitcoins in India using a service like WazirX. Although the platform is still in beta, it includes both crypto-to-crypto exchange and peer-to-peer trading service which lets trade INR for Tether (USDT) cryptocurrency.\n\nBuying or selling goods and services for bitcoin in India\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t purchase or sell bitcoin using the methods mentioned above, you can obtain or use your bitcoins for goods and services. Although you won\u2019t be able to spend your bitcoins wherever you like, you can check websites like Coinmap.org to discover bitcoin-friendly services.\n\nBitcoin-friendly merchants in India. Source: Coinmap.org\n\nOtherwise, you can offer goods and services for bitcoin yourself. But don\u2019t forget to check with legal authorities how you can do so according to the law.\n\nSee our other guide for more information about how to accept bitcoin as a business.\n\nThese are the methods you can use to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC) in India. Although currently there are no Bitcoin ATMs in the country, there are plenty of alternatives for how you can get BTC.\n\nDespite the unwelcome regulatory climate, more and more innovative Indian Bitcoin trading platforms are emerging, thus sparking a new wave of financial freedom, censorship-resistance, and entrepreneurship in India."

        "content": "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / June 15, 2023 / DexOrdi, the pioneering decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on Bitcoin Network, is driving innovation in the DeFi landscape on the Bitcoin network. Leveraging advanced Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, DexOrdi is revolutionizing decentralized trading with its focus on efficiency, liquidity provision, security, and user accessibility. By paving the way for a new era of decentralized finance based on the BRC-20 standard, DexOrdi is empowering traders to unlock the full potential of decentralized trading on Bitcoin Network.\n\nDexOrdi, Thursday, June 15, 2023, Press release picture\n\nThe BRC-20 standard is an experimental token standard designed to facilitate the creation and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain through the Ordinals protocol. Inspired by Ethereum's token standards, BRC-20 tokens offer unique mechanisms and functions. Although BRC-20 tokens gained considerable popularity in the first half of 2023, it is important to note that they are still in the experimental phase, requiring users to exercise utmost caution.\n\nDexOrdi is at the forefront of integrating BRC-20 tokens into its decentralized trading platform. By enabling direct trading of BRC-20 tokens with Bitcoin on dexordi and vice versa, DexOrdi provides seamless interoperability between Bitcoin-based assets and BRC-20 tokens. Moreover, BRC-20 tokens inherit the robust security features of the Bitcoin network, offering protection against double-spending and 51% network attacks.\n\nThe creation of BRC-20 tokens emerged from the introduction of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin's protocol in January 2023. This development spurred the exploration of fungible tokens on the network. In March 2023, a pseudonymous programmer named Domo established the BRC-20 token standards, enabling the minting of fungible tokens on Bitcoin. The first deployed BRC-20 token, named \"ordi,\" gained swift integration support from Bitcoin wallets. Subsequently, numerous other BRC-20 tokens were launched, some experiencing significant market capitalization and price surges by May 2023. The increasing demand for BRC-20 tokens contributed to a surge in Bitcoin transaction fees and notable congestion on the Bitcoin network.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that the BRC-20 token standard is experimental, carrying inherent uncertainties and risks. Users are advised to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging with BRC-20 tokens, considering their limited utility and the dynamic nature of their future prospects.\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem continues to evolve, DexOrdi remains committed to providing traders with a reliable and transformative platform. DexOrdi's vision is to empower users by embracing cutting-edge technologies and ensuring the security and efficiency of decentralized trading on the Bitcoin network.\n\nFor more information about DexOrdi, please visit www.dexordi.com or follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/dexordi\n\nJoin on Telegram: https://t.me/dexordi\n\nFollow on Medium: https://medium.com/@dexordi\n\nAbout DexOrdi\n\nDexOrdi is a leading decentralized finance platform on the Bitcoin network, pioneering innovative solutions for decentralized trading. With its advanced AMM technology and focus on efficiency, liquidity provision, security, and user accessibility, DexOrdi is transforming the decentralized trading landscape.

        "title": "We asked ChatGPT to write a rap song about Bitcoin by SEC's Gary Gensler - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Gary Gensler, the chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has faced scrutiny recently for his approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. He has been accused of not providing clear guidelines for digital assets while his agency takes action against prominent crypto entities such as Coinbase and Binance for listing potentially unregistered securities.\n\nCritics argue that Gensler\u2019s approach is stifling the crypto industry\u2019s growth, with opinions varied over his approach. To capture Gensler\u2019s perspective on Bitcoin (BTC), Finbold sought insights from the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform, ChatGPT, which presented Gensler\u2019s views as a rap song.\n\nInterestingly, the rap lyrics supported Bitcoin, which partly contradicts the SEC and Gensler\u2019s stance on the cryptocurrency market. In the first verse, Gensler emphasized the song\u2019s supposed theme by acknowledging that Bitcoin has made the market go wild.\n\nThe chorus stressed Bitcoin\u2019s status as digital gold, highlighting its comparison to the precious metal as a potential store of value and hedge against inflation.\n\nIt also acknowledges that Bitcoin has made investors wealthy, but it cautions about the associated risks and the importance of regulating the asset.\n\n\u201cBitcoin, Bitcoin, the digital gold, But it\u2019s a wild ride, so I gotta be bold. Investors getting rich, but risks are high, Gotta regulate this game, gotta give it a try,\u201d the chorus reads.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s revolutionary nature\n\nIn the second verse, ChatGPT proposes that Gensler would rap about Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and the revolutionary approach but also delves into its associated risks. The verse addresses issues such as market manipulation and fraud while emphasizing the importance of safeguarding investors.\n\nMoving to the fourth verse, Gensler would purportedly raps about the crucial need for transparency in the crypto sector and the necessity of regulations. However, the verse also acknowledges the significant innovations brought about by the industry.\n\n\u201cTransparency is key, we need regulations in place, AML and KYC, gotta maintain the pace. I\u2019m all for innovation, but let\u2019s not forget, We need safeguards in this crypto asset,\u201d the fourth verse reads.\n\nIn the final verse, the emphasis is on Gensler\u2019s mission to educate the masses about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It is suggested that Gensler would rap about the importance of this mission. The verse would also touch upon the role of lawmakers in shaping rules that promote fairness in the crypto sector, according to the tool\u2019s analysis.\n\nFor the bridge, ChatGPT envisions a Gensler rap song on Bitcoin that provides a general overview of the sector. The lyrics highlight the immense potential of blockchain technology and call for unity among players in the crypto industry to create a safer space while embracing innovation and protecting investors.\n\nCrypto is here to stay\n\nIn the outro, ChatGPT suggests that Gensler would emphasize the permanence of the crypto space, reinforcing the idea that it is here to stay.\n\n\u201cSo remember, my friends, crypto\u2019s here to stay, But we must proceed with caution, every single day. Gary Gensler and the SEC, we\u2019re on the case, To ensure a thriving market with a solid embrace,\u201d reads the outro.\n\nIndeed, Gensler\u2019s approach to crypto regulation has also caught the attention of lawmakers. As reported by Finbold back in April, Gensler was grilled by the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee over practices in the sector.\n\nHere\u2019s the full rap song \u2018by Gary Gensler\u2019:\n\n(Verse 1)\n\nYo, it\u2019s Gensler, SEC regulator in control,\n\nBitcoin\u2019s on the rise, but there\u2019s risks untold.\n\nDecentralized gold, disrupting the game,\n\nBut market manipulation is causing some pain.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nBitcoin, the digital gold of the town,\n\nBut we gotta regulate, put the wild ride down.\n\nInvestors getting rich, but risks are high,\n\nI\u2019m here to protect, so let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n(Verse 2)\n\nTransparency\u2019s crucial, regulations in sight,\n\nAML and KYC, keeping things right.\n\nWe need safeguards, this market needs care,\n\nEducating the masses, leveling the playing square.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nBitcoin, the digital gold of the town,\n\nBut we gotta regulate, put the wild ride down.\n\nInvestors getting rich, but risks are high,\n\nI\u2019m here to protect, so let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n(Verse 3)\n\nInnovation\u2019s fantastic, but let\u2019s not forget,\n\nFrauds and scams lurk, causing regret.\n\nCollaborating with lawmakers, shaping the rules,\n\nEnsuring fairness, protecting investors like jewels.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nBitcoin, the digital gold of the town,\n\nBut we gotta regulate, put the wild ride down.\n\nInvestors getting rich, but risks are high,\n\nI\u2019m here to protect, so let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n(Verse 4)\n\nBlockchain\u2019s potential, a revolution it brings,\n\nBut we must address the dark side it swings.\n\nCreating a safer space, where trust can thrive,\n\nBalancing innovation and keeping markets alive.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nBitcoin, the digital gold of the town,\n\nBut we gotta regulate, put the wild ride down.\n\nInvestors getting rich, but risks are high,\n\nI\u2019m here to protect, so let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n(Outro)\n\nTogether we\u2019ll build a robust crypto land,\n\nWhere investors are secure, and scams are banned.\n\nGary Gensler and the SEC, leading the way,\n\nEnsuring a prosperous market, day by day.\n\n-The End-\n\nFeatured image via Bloomberg YouTube."

        "content": "Miami \u201cbitcoin mayor\u201d Francis Suarez has a new pitch to potential voters and investors: Bitcoin President. The 45-year-old mayor released a brief video announcing his candidacy on Thursday and filed FEC paperwork officially entering him into an increasingly crowded 2024 Republican primary field. Suarez, who bills himself as an energetic, tech-friendly futurist was one of several prominent US mayors who emphatically boosted Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the lead-up to the industry\u2019s disastrous collapse last year.\n\nHe Tossed His Bitcoin, Now He Wants It Back CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video He Tossed His Bitcoin, Now He Wants It Back\n\nSuarez\u2019s announcement video shows him literally \u201crunning\u201d for president through Miami\u2019s lush city streets, making pit stops along the way at his parent\u2019s home and former elementary school. \u201cI have always been a runner,\u201d Saurez says moments before dramatically staring into the camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Miami mayor spent the remainder of the video taking a victory lap, noting an uptick in the city\u2019s economy, a \u201chistoric\u201d lowering of taxes, and lessening unemployment during his two terms. Suarez made a point to emphasize Miami\u2019s recent attraction of tech companies and investors, some of which decamped in the city after fleeing former hubs during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cToday, our city is a major technology hub,\u201d Suarez notes while weaving his way through traffic. \u201cBecause we chose to embrace innovation.\u201d Suarez\u2019s office did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat about crypto?\n\n\n\nOne area notably absent from Suarez\u2019s announcement video, however, was his embrace of cryptocurrency. Suarez was among the most vocal US politicians in 2021 singing crypto\u2019s praises, with a stated goal of transforming Miami into the world\u2019s first Web3 city. The mayor briefly explored paying residents dividends from a municipal \u201cbitcoin yield.\u201d At one point, Suarez even proposed giving municipal workers in the city the option to get paid and pay their taxes in Bitcoin. Suarez himself also revealed he would accept 100% of his own government salary in bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy wife asked me if that was a good idea, but certainly when governments are spending that kind of money that they are, when you have inflation at the point that it is, when you have rampant overspending in government and deficit spending, all of that pushes in favor of an increase in the price of Bitcoin,\u201d Suarez told Fox News in a November 2021 interview.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough it\u2019s hard to say what effect those antics had on driving up actual cryptocurrency adoption in the city, it did lead to a hefty inflow of new campaign donations sent by wealthy tech investors. The pandering also led to an influx of boom-time crypto capital into the city. In maybe the clearest example of this, Miami-Dade officials in 2021 signed a 19-year $135 million naming rights agreement with FTX to make the now disgraced cryptocurrency exchange the face of the Miami Heat\u2019s basketball stadium. The stadium revoked that name last year following FTX\u2019s sudden collapse and its founder\u2019s criminal indictment.\n\nSaurez hasn\u2019t disavowed cryptocurrencies, but he also isn\u2019t mentioning it with the same level of frequent glee as he once did. The cryptocurrency industry experienced possibly the worst downturn in its brief history last year thanks to the collapse of multiple exchanges, criminal indictments, and more than a handful of lost fortunes. Suarez\u2019s own Bitcoin salary took a plunge last year when the price of Bitcoin tanked by as much as 40% in a two-month span. The mayor still stands by the salary decision but he, like other crypto evangelists politicians, has since taken his foot off the Bitcoin hype accelerator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy salary is actually up,\u201d Suarez assured CNBC in January. \u201cIt\u2019s actually been a pretty good investment!\u201d\n\nSuarez enters the 2024 Republican presidential primary race less than one week after the front runner, former President Donald Trump, was indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal charges related to his improper storage of classified White House documents. So far, the list of contenders hoping to steal Trump\u2019s chokehold on the party is already a dozen strong and includes Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former Vice President Mike Pence, and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott along with a handful of wishful longshots."

        "title": "EOS vs. Bitcoin: Which Cryptocurrency is Right for You? - Crypto Times",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, there are two titans that stand above the rest: EOS and Bitcoin. Both have their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and investors are constantly debating which one is the better investment.\n\nBoth have their own unique advantages and disadvantages, so it\u2019s important to weigh your options carefully before deciding which one is right for you. So invest in them using an automated trading bot. Visit https://quantum-code.app/ and get started now!\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at EOS and Bitcoin:\n\nEOS: The Scalable Upstart\n\nEOS is a blockchain-based platform that was designed to be a more scalable and user-friendly alternative to Bitcoin. It uses a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, which allows for faster transaction processing and lower fees. EOS is also designed to be more developer-friendly, with a built-in set of tools and services that make it easier to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nEOS was launched in 2018 and quickly gained attention from investors and developers alike. Its market capitalization grew to over $10 billion within months of its launch, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies in terms of market value.\n\nSome experts believe that EOS could be the future of cryptocurrency, while others believe that it is simply a flash in the pan. Only time will tell which side is correct, but EOS is certainly worth keeping an eye on.\n\nHere are some of the advantages of EOS:\n\nScalability: EOS is designed to be highly scalable, meaning that it can handle a large number of transactions per second. This makes it ideal for use in applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nUser-friendliness: EOS is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use. This could make it more accessible to a wider range of users, which could lead to increased adoption.\n\nDevelopment Potential: EOS is a very developer-friendly platform, making it easy for developers to build and deploy dApps. This could lead to a Cambrian explosion of dApps being built on EOS, which could further increase its adoption.\n\nBitcoin: The Established Veteran\n\nBitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which is slower and more energy-intensive than EOS\u2019s DPoS mechanism. However, Bitcoin is also more secure, as it is more difficult to attack a PoW network.\n\nBitcoin has emerged as the leading cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization that dwarfs most of its competitors. As a decentralized digital currency that operates on a blockchain network, Bitcoin promises to provide a secure, fast, and low-cost means of transferring value across borders. Its supply is limited to 21 million coins, which gives it a scarcity that some investors find attractive.\n\nHere are some of the advantages of Bitcoin:\n\nSecurity: Bitcoin is a more secure cryptocurrency than EOS. This is because Bitcoin uses a more robust consensus mechanism, which makes it more difficult to attack the network.\n\nEstablished: Bitcoin is a more established cryptocurrency than EOS. This means that it has a larger user base and a more mature ecosystem.\n\nBrand Recognition: Bitcoin has a higher brand recognition than EOS. This means that it is more likely to be accepted by merchants and other businesses.\n\nSo, which one should you choose EOS or Bitcoin?\n\nThe answer depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency that is scalable, user-friendly, and has the potential for significant growth, then EOS is a good option. However, if you\u2019re looking for a more secure and established cryptocurrency, then Bitcoin is a better choice.\n\nUltimately, the decision of which cryptocurrency to invest in is up to you. Do your research, weigh the risks and rewards, and make the decision that\u2019s right for you.\n\nHere is a table that summarizes the key differences between EOS and Bitcoin:\n\nFeature EOS Bitcoin Consensus mechanism DPoS PoW Scalability More scalable Less scalable User-friendliness More user-friendly Less user-friendly Development potential More developer-friendly Less developer-friendly Security Less secure More secure Potential for growth More potential for growth Less potential for growth\n\nHere are some additional things to consider when choosing between EOS and Bitcoin:\n\nYour Investment Goals: If you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency to hold for the long term, then Bitcoin may be a better option. However, if you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency to trade for short-term profits, then EOS may be a better option.\n\nYour Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is a more established cryptocurrency, so it is less risky than EOS. However, EOS has the potential for significant growth, so it could be a good investment for investors who are willing to take on more risk.\n\nYour Technical Expertise: EOS is a more complex cryptocurrency than Bitcoin, so it may be a better option for investors who have some technical knowledge.\n\nAlso Read: Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe decision of whether to invest in Bitcoin or EOS ultimately depends on the investor\u2019s risk appetite, investment goals, and market outlook. Both cryptocurrencies offer unique value propositions and investment opportunities, but also come with risks and uncertainties. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each cryptocurrency, investors can make more informed decisions and build a diversified portfolio that aligns with their financial goals."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf you\u2019re on the hunt for a casual, free-to-play mobile game that pays you cryptocurrency along the way, Ethereum Blast might do the trick.\n\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say I had a \u201cblast\u201d playing through the simplistic color-matching puzzle stages, it\u2019s a decently fun diversion that can put a little bit of Ethereum or Bitcoin into your wallet while you play.\n\nBling Financial\u2019s free iOS and Android game is a simple color-matching puzzle game with a vibe that\u2019s best described as \u201csci-fi meets Ethereum.\u201d All that really means is that you\u2019ll see the familiar Ethereum symbol floating around the menus and interface here and there, and people who aren\u2019t crypto die-hards shouldn\u2019t be turned off by that modest window dressing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum Blast is a straightforward puzzler, tasking you with tapping two or more connected, like-colored stones to clear them from the board. As you clear stones, new ones fall from above to fill the space and potentially sets up larger matches that can earn you power-ups in the process. Each level provides certain targets of stones or items to clear within a limited number of moves.\n\nScreenshots from Ethereum Blast on iOS. Image: Decrypt\n\nIt\u2019s all easy to grasp and control, with simple taps used to clear blocks or activate power-ups. But it\u2019s also largely unchallenging and mostly mindless, and you'll earn plenty of power-ups to get you out of any binds. I played through nearly 50 stages and only lost once along the way. But as a simple on-the-go distraction, it\u2019s pleasant enough\u2014much like Tetro Tiles, another mobile puzzler with crypto rewards.\n\nHow much can you reasonably earn by playing? Your mileage may vary, but I earned about $0.20 worth of crypto in about two hours of play. Bling\u2019s games reward you with Bling points that you can then convert into Ethereum or Bitcoin, and then cash out to a Coinbase or PayPal account. I cashed out in ETH, but it would\u2019ve been the same USD value in Bitcoin too.\n\nIt\u2019s not much\u2014but it\u2019s more than I earned playing Bling\u2019s Bitcoin Solitaire, which earned me about $0.09 worth of Bitcoin in a two-hour span. However, your earning potential in Ethereum Blast diminishes the more you play, as the amount of Bling points offered for playing each stage appears to dwindle over time. The game may not hold your interest for long anyway.\n\nAnd to be clear, the amount of ads you\u2019ll watch to earn even pennies\u2019 worth of crypto is pretty overwhelming. You\u2019ll face a full-screen video ad after nearly each completed level, and these typically last for a minute or more before you\u2019re able to tap your way out of them. Given how short the levels are, that means you\u2019ll spend about as much time playing as watching ads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIs that worth it to make about $0.10 per hour? Honestly, I\u2019d rather spend my time playing a more engaging mobile puzzler without crypto rewards\u2014like Threes or Grindstone, or my on-and-off guilty pleasure, Candy Crush Saga. But if you\u2019re intent on \u201cstacking sats\u201d or eking out ETH while playing games, Ethereum Blast is a solid option."

        "content": "In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, the spotlight often shifts between different tokens. Today, we delve into the recent developments of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bitcoin (BTC), and introduce an upcoming project, Collateral Network, which is set to disrupt the lending industry with its presale of the $COLT token.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nShiba Inu: A Meme Token with Real-World Impact\n\nThe Shiba Inu token SHIB is witnessing a high burn rate lately. This could be the push it needs to make it big in the crypto world.\n\nShiba Inu, often referred to as the \u201cDogecoin killer,\u201d is a decentralized meme token that grew into a vibrant ecosystem. ShibaSwap, fun tokens, and an Artist Incubator are some of the exciting features of the Shiba Inu project.\n\nIn recent months, Shiba Inu has been making headlines for various reasons. The token\u2019s burn rate surged by 60%, while the new Twitter CEO showed interest in the meme coin.\n\nAll these facts indicate a bullish momentum for Shiba Inu, with analysts predicting a rally to $0.00000861 in the short term. Moreover, the memecoin could trade as high as $0.0000160 in the following weeks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing for Shiba Inu. The community recently had to alert its members about new scam methods targeting them. Despite these challenges, Shiba Inu continues to be a token of interest in the crypto market, as suggested by its price prediction.\n\nBitcoin: The Pioneer in Volatile Waters\n\nThe king of kings of the crypto world, Bitcoin, is seeing price volatility recently, due to macro events that impact all assets.\n\nBitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, has been the vanguard of the crypto market. It\u2019s a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator. Bitcoin allows peer-to-peer transactions on the network without intermediaries.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent developments have been a rollercoaster ride. With the Consumer Price Index (CPI) volatility, Bitcoin traders are bracing themselves as the BTC price taps $26,000. This focus on CPI volatility indicates the influence of macroeconomic factors on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nDespite the volatility, Bitcoin remains a significant player in the crypto space. Its resilience and adaptability have allowed it to weather various storms, reinforcing its position as a stable investment.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network: A New Era of Lending\n\nCollateral Network, an upcoming project in the crypto space, is set to disrupt the traditional lending industry. This Ethereum-based web3 peer-to-peer lending platform is designed to allow users to borrow cryptocurrencies against physical assets on the blockchain.\n\nThe Collateral Network platform addresses several problems prevalent in the current lending industry. These include difficulties in obtaining loans for non-traditional assets, outdated pawnbroking practices, limited credit options in certain countries, and the red tape associated with short-term loans.\n\nCollateral Network accepts a wide range of assets as collateral. These include real estate, fine art, vintage cars, gold, fine wines, watches, diamonds, and collectibles. This broad acceptance of assets on Collateral Network opens up opportunities for individuals who have traditionally found it challenging to secure loans against these types of assets.\n\nWith an initial starting price of $0.01 and a total supply of 1.4 billion COLT tokens, analysts predict a 3,500% price increase during the presale. The token will surge by 100x when it lists on major exchanges. The team behind Collateral Network is doxxed and KYC audited, and the token smart contract is fully audited, adding to the project\u2019s credibility.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As we cross the mid-year mark of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) has weathered a tumultuous journey. Bitcoin\u2019s value has surged by over 55% since the year\u2019s outset, bestowing millionaire status on nearly 48,000 individuals. But opportunities abound even for those who missed the boat on buying Bitcoin at its multi-year low. In the vibrant meme coin sector, MillionaireGame Coin (MG) stands ready to launch its unique millionaire-making venture.\n\nWhat is \u201cminting\u201d millionaires?\n\nMillionaireGame Coin (MG) is a meme coin on Ethereum, currently conducting its presale campaign. MillionaireGame Coin (MG) focuses on one thing: creating millionaires among its token holders. Once the presale stage is complete and the Millionaire Game begins, one lucky token holder will be randomly chosen every month to receive its millionaire prize. Buying MillionaireGame Coin (MG) thus directly increases one\u2019s chance of becoming a crypto millionaire.\n\nJust like Ethereum, which emphasizes technical prowess, the MillionaireGame Coin (MG) game will be run by smart contracts to ensure transparency and fairness. Meanwhile, a sustainable tokenomics has been designed, which can, as claimed by the team, continue the Millionaire Game for more than 50 years as long as the token market value is above $40 million and the price grows by 2%. If this happens, tons of millionaires will be born from the MillionaireGame Coin (MG) game, and MillionaireGame Coin (MG) is bound to become the next powerful whale club on the Ethereum network.\n\nRelated Reading: Game for Creating New Millionaires?\n\nHow many Bitcoin millionaires are there?\n\nWithout question, 2022 has etched its mark in the annals of cryptocurrency history as a period of turbulence. A string of project failures culminated in a severe market slump, leading to a widespread departure of investors. At its nadir, Bitcoin dwindled to a low of around $15,000. Yet, in retrospect, it is unsurprising that this bearish phase did not extend into 2023.\n\nThe early part of 2023 witnessed a remarkable rebound in Bitcoin\u2019s fortune. The tally of addresses holding a million or more soared from 28,084 in January to a whopping 47,994 at present. This equates to a stunning growth rate of 170.89% within a few short months, demonstrating a dramatic revival in the crypto landscape.\n\nDrivers of the New Crypto Millionaires\n\nThe generation of new crypto millionaires can be attributed to the turbulence in the cryptocurrency market, investors\u2019 expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, and the progress of MillionaireGame Coin (MG)\u2019s presale. The increase in the number of Bitcoin millionaires and the meteoric rise of meme coins caught off guard only those who envisioned the bearish trend lingering long beyond the market upheavals of 2022.\n\nMillionaireGame Coin (MG) has just announced the price for the stage two of its presale, with the token about to experience an 18% surge. Investors interested in the Millionaire Game should keep a close watch.\n\nMillionaireGame (MG) Mainnet: https://www.millionairegame.net/\n\nJoin Presale Stage 2: https://www.millionairegame.net/claim-discount\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
