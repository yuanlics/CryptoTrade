        "content": "Visa is Bringing Bitcoin Pollution Everywhere You Want to Be\n\nVisa is just about everywhere with its credit and debit card offerings accepted by millions of merchants around the globe and used by millions of people to make their daily purchases. Now, the world\u2019s largest payment processor is also exploring new ways for customers and businesses to use Bitcoin.\n\nVisa is just about everywhere with its credit and debit card offerings accepted by millions of merchants around the globe and used by millions of people to make their daily purchases. Now, the world\u2019s largest payment processor is also exploring new ways for customers and businesses to use Bitcoin. This support for Bitcoin contradicts the company\u2019s stated commitments to sustainability and reducing climate warming emissions because Bitcoin is an electricity hog, often powered by dirty energy. Bitcoin operations could become even worse due to adoption driven by Visa\u2019s new services.\n\nWhile Visa has extensive expertise on cryptocurrencies, the company is not putting those resources to work on cleaning up Bitcoin\u2019s pollution and climate impacts despite making strong corporate climate action pledges.\n\nHelping Grow Bitcoin\u2019s Pollution\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is primarily a speculative investment in which people bet on whether its price goes up or down. With support from Visa and other large financial services companies, that could change. Visa is making it easier for people to buy, trade, and spend bitcoin which is vital for the cryptocurrencies growth and its actual use for transactions. Visa is collaborating with crypto exchanges to let people buy their morning cup of coffee or weekly groceries using bitcoin. For example, people in the U.S. who store bitcoin in a Coinbase wallet can spend it at any merchant in Visa\u2019s vast network thanks to a card issued in partnership with Coinbase.\n\nMore widespread use and greater demand means a higher bitcoin price, which has historically contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s enormous energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. [1] Here\u2019s why: when the price of bitcoin is high, there is incentive for \u201cminers\u201d to employ more computing power and electricity in the digital guessing game to win new bitcoin and fees.\n\nMuch of Bitcoin\u2019s electricity use is generated by fossil fuels: 62% globally according to estimates from Cambridge University researchers. And dirty coal is the largest single source.\n\nBitcoin miners using more energy also puts more demand on often-strained electrical grids and uses energy that could be directed towards other socially necessary uses including the rapid expansion of electrification that is needed to address the climate crisis.\n\nPutting Dirty Bitcoin in Your Wallet\n\nVisa is one of several large financial services companies leading the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nVisa has multiple crypto-linked credit and debit cards that enable customers to spend and earn rewards in bitcoin. One such card is offered in partnership with Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States. The Coinbase card automatically converts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to US Dollars at point of sale with any retailer in Visa\u2019s network. Customers can also earn reward points in bitcoin. Visa also partnered with Crypto.com, another large crypto exchange company, to support a prepaid card that customers can load with bitcoin. This joins other bitcoin rewards debit cards like the one offered by Fold in collaboration with Visa which has reportedly rewarded over $30 million in bitcoin since launching in 2020.\n\nConcerningly, Visa is also expanding its crypto offerings around the world despite mounting evidence of Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact. The company recently launched a debit card in collaboration with EU crypto exchange Lama that allows customers to spend their bitcoin. Visa created a long-term strategic partnership with Wirex, a crypto platform and exchange company, to expand in the United Kingdom and Asia-Pacific by offering crypto debit and prepaid cards.\n\nPartnerships with crypto companies and products that enable using bitcoin have created a growing business for Visa. In the first quarter of 2022, Visa reported that customers made $2.5 billion worth of purchases on their Visa crypto cards. The company said its network of crypto wallet partners grew from 54 to 65 by early 2022, including Coinbase, Circle, and BlockFi, and that almost 100 million merchants now accept crypto, including bitcoin, on the Visa network. In February 2023, Visa leaders denied a Reuters report claiming the company was pausing new crypto partnerships and services, and reaffirmed that the company was still moving forward into the crypto sector.\n\nVisa also helps other companies adopt cryptocurrencies. And because Bitcoin has the largest market cap of any cryptocurrency, this certainly includes Bitcoin. Visa\u2019s Digital Currency Innovation Hub assists clients in understanding cryptocurrencies and creating new business opportunities and products. Visa\u2019s crypto consulting and advisory services help clients, like financial institutions and retailers, navigate the complex and changing cryptocurrency landscape. The hub also publishes public educational materials on crypto and blockchain technologies.\n\nBitcoin Reveals Visa\u2019s Climate Hypocrisy\n\nVisa has committed to reaching net zero by 2040, in line with the goals set by the Paris Climate Agreement. To accomplish this, Visa has set science based emissions reductions targets to meet a 1.5 C pathway that many see as necessary for avoiding the worst of the climate catastrophe. Visa also says the company embeds sustainability into its partnerships and initiatives, principles the company does not appear to be applying in its Bitcoin-related partnerships. Visa also offers products to increase public awareness of climate change, such as a CO2 calculator for customers to track emissions from their purchases. Yet, Visa has not done anything to account for emissions from bitcoin transactions even though researchers find that bitcoin transactions have a much larger carbon footprint than transactions using US Dollars and other traditional government-issued currencies.\n\nVisa needs to work on cleaning up Bitcoin or stop growing its Bitcoin-related services. Publicly acknowledging Bitcoin\u2019s climate problems is the first step. This is an opportunity for Visa to lead the financial services sector on climate change, sustainability, and technological innovation. We need companies like Visa to send a powerful message to Bitcoin adopters that the technology needs to innovate to align with climate goals.\n\nCryptocurrencies can operate using cleaner technologies, and with the support and creativity of companies like Visa, we can future-proof Bitcoin against a warming world.\n\nNotes"

        "content": "Bitcoin fell 1.3% in the hour leading up to 9:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, to trade at US$27,369 following the U.S. jobs report release. The world\u2019s largest economy added 336,000 new jobs in September, far exceeding preliminary expectations of 170,000 and fueling concerns that interest rates will remain high over a longer period of time.\n\nBitcoin has been trading under US$30,000 since July after surging past the mark behind the series of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund applications from some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nHopes that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would greenlight a spot Bitcoin ETF have been further boosted by Grayscale Invesment\u2019s legal victory in August. The court sided with the firm in challenging the SEC\u2019s rejection of the fund manager\u2019s application to convert its Bitcoin fund into an ETF.\n\nBut this week, Ethereum-based financial products stole the show.\n\nBitwise\u2019s Ether Futures ETFs launched on Monday, along with seven other Ether ETFs from companies including Valkyrie, VanEck, ProShares and VolShares. Ether briefly rose to a weekly high of US$1,736 on Monday, before losing the US$1,700 psychological mark on the same day. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency was trading at US$1,621 as of 9:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 0.8% in the hour following the U.S. jobs report.\n\nSee related article: Valkyrie CIO expects US spot Bitcoin ETF approval in Q2 2024\n\n\u201cApproval of the recent Ether ETFs formally signals that Ether, like Bitcoin, is not a security under U.S. laws. This non-security classification will help drive increased institutional and retail investment flows,\u201d Collin Woodward, a Web3 lawyer and president of Web3 software firm StealthTest, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe first spot Bitcoin ETF [in the U.S.] is inevitable. It\u2019s just a matter of when, and that approval actually paves the way for more Ether ETFs, including an eventual spot Ether ETF,\u201c added Woodward.\n\nBitcoin also rose to a near five-week high of US$28,434 on Monday following the launch of the Ether ETFs, gaining 4.12% before falling to the US$27,500 mark on Tuesday.\n\nSee related article: NFT creators seek alternatives after OpenSea cuts royalties\n\nNext Week: Will Bitcoin prices rise during Uptober?\n\nCrypto traders often refer to the month of October as \u201cUptober,\u201d in reference to Bitcoin\u2019s strong historic performance during the month, including setting new record highs in October 2017 and 2020.\n\nNext week, the U.S. is expected to release its Consumer Price Index data for the month of September. The inflation gauge is often used by market analysts to predict the Federal Reserve\u2019s stance on interest rates.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said that confidence in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation is increasing, along with investor appetite for the asset.\n\nSee related article: CMCC Global raises US$100 mln to launch Hong Kong Web3 fund"

        "title": "Another Eye-Catching Bitcoin Forecast - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Experienced cryptocurrency investors know that there are plenty of large, not-yet-reached bitcoin forecasts floating around. The largest digital currency has been dithering in a range of $26,000 to $30,000. And mostly on the lower end for several months now. Crypto novices may find it difficult to believe Bitcoin\u2019s best days may lie ahead.\n\nThose investors might want to take heart because some crypto experts are incredibly bullish on bitcoin and if their forecasts come anywhere close to being accurate, exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) .\n\nConsider commentary from BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. In a recent interview with YouTuber Tom Bilyeu, Hayes said he believes the dominant cryptocurrency can ascend from $750,000 to $1 million in 2026. Even the low end of that range implies a nearly 27x increase from current levels. A move that if it materializes would likely bear significant fruit for SATO.\n\nHow SATO Could Benefit\n\nSATO\u2019s correlations to Bitcoin prices are well-documented. For starters, the Invesco ETF\u2019s largest holding is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Second, crypto-correlated equities make up the rest of the fund\u2019s roster. The latter point factors into Hayes\u2019s forecast because he sees favorable macroeconomic factors propelling bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI think it will be the biggest boom in financial markets we have ever seen in human history. Bitcoin will have a ridiculous price, Nasdaq will have a ridiculous price, S&P will have a ridiculous price. Pick your stock industry,\u201d he told Bilyeu.\n\nAnother point of interest for SATO investors and those evaluating the ETF is the potential for bitcoin to benefit from tighter monetary policy around the world. Hayes offered up that thesis in the interview. A view that runs counter to the dismal price action notched in 2022 by cryptocurrencies amid an avalanche of interest rate hikes by central banks around the world.\n\n\u201cAs we get to some kind of financial disturbance and people realize that real rates are negative, if governments are growing nominal at 10%, 5%, 6%, people at the market will start buying other stuff,\u201d added the BitMEX founder. \u201cCrypto is one of those things.\u201d\n\nFor investors worried that Hayes\u2019s bitcoin forecast is overly aggressive, his medium outlook is more digestible. He expects the digital currency will remain range-bound for the remainder of this year. But he added it could ascend to $70,000 next year \u2013 a more than 2.5x jump from current levels.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel.\n\nvettafi.com is owned by VettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d).

        "title": "Thinking About Getting a Loan With Your Bitcoin? You'll Want to Read This First - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Investors are discovering new ways to put their Bitcoin (BTC -2.59%) holdings to use as the cryptocurrency becomes more widely accepted in the financial world. One such option is to use Bitcoin as collateral to secure a loan.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to move forward, there is a growing desire among holders to access the asset's liquidity without having to sell it. However, investors interested in obtaining a Bitcoin-backed loan will quickly realize that there are significant differences compared to traditional loans.\n\nHere's a detailed overview of what these loans entail to help investors make more informed decisions about Bitcoin-backed loans and the various options available.\n\nGeneral differences\n\nLike any other loan, the total value of the loan holders can obtain depends on the amount of collateral they can offer. Loans on some other assets, like some mortgage products with real estate as collateral, offer up to 97% loan-to-value (LTV), meaning they only need to offer up to 3% of the total loan as collateral. However, Bitcoin's extreme price volatility means that those seeking to leverage their holdings will face more stringent borrowing terms.\n\nActual conditions vary between lenders and depend on market conditions, but it isn't uncommon for Bitcoin loans to require LTV ratios as high as 50%. Under these circumstances, a potential borrower with $500,000 in Bitcoin could only borrow up to $250,000. Compare this to a prospective home buyer looking for a mortgage, where one might be able to borrow $485,000 toward a $500,000 home, assuming they meet specific criteria.\n\nNot only do Bitcoin loan borrowers have to pledge more collateral, but the interest rates tied to these loans are generally much higher. While the average mortgage interest rate hovers around 8% today, Bitcoin borrowers should generally expect rates to be even higher than this, at times up to 15%.\n\nAvailable options\n\nClearly, there are distinct differences to consider when looking to obtain Bitcoin-collateralized loans. But sometimes, personal conditions or financial goals warrant exploring Bitcoin loans. For those interested, there are two main routes to obtain Bitcoin loans: Centralized and decentralized lenders.\n\nCentralized lending platforms provide a more traditional approach to obtaining loans using Bitcoin as collateral. These platforms, operated by a centralized authority such as a company or bank, are usually more straightforward and accessible. Typically, users can choose to receive loans in fiat currency or in stablecoins. The advantages of centralized lenders include a less complicated process, higher loan amounts compared to decentralized platforms, and potential access to a broader range of assets for borrowing. Popular centralized options include Unchained Capital, Binance, and Bitfinex.\n\nHowever, the centralized platforms aren't without their risks. During the recent crypto winter and market volatility hit, multiple crypto lenders became insolvent, ultimately putting borrowers' assets at risk.\n\nDecentralized Bitcoin loans, facilitated through decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchains like Stacks or Wrapped Bitcoin, offer an alternative to collateralize Bitcoin without having to trust or rely on a centralized intermediary. By locking up Bitcoin, users can generate a loan in stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. This method substantially reduces counterparty risk, as the process is managed by smart contracts, providing transparency and security.\n\nLike the centralized platforms, there are some drawbacks with DeFi lenders. The interest rates on DeFi loans are often not fixed and can be highly volatile. Additionally, the DeFi space can be complex, potentially posing challenges for less experienced users.\n\nFinal considerations\n\nFor investors seeking swift access to liquidity without triggering taxable events, Bitcoin loans can present a valuable financial opportunity. However, as with any financial decision, careful consideration of individual circumstances and alignment with personal goals is crucial.\n\nWhether people are opting for centralized lenders with their established systems or decentralized platforms offering alternatives, understanding the collateralization process, loan terms, and associated risks like interest rates and potential smart contract vulnerabilities is paramount. Ultimately, the decision to leverage Bitcoin as collateral for loans demands a balance between financial objectives and risk tolerance."

        "title": "3 reasons why Bitcoin is struggling to rally above $28.5K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On Oct. 2, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) saw a 5.5% intraday increase to $28,600, but the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lost momentum as the highly anticipated launch of Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to generate significant trading volumes.\n\nWhile the recent rally into the upper end of the current price range was likely encouraging to investors, recent comments from United States Federal Reserve representatives reiterated concerns about an impending economic downturn.\n\nBitcoin demonstrated short-term strength by maintaining support at $27,200 on Oct. 3 and subsequently surged above $27,500 on Oct. 5. Nevertheless, three key trading metrics indicate a lackluster level of support. These metrics encompass spot market volumes, derivatives and confidence in the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMacroeconomic forces exert downward pressure on Bitcoin price\n\nOn Oct. 2, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr stated in New York that he anticipates a slowdown in economic growth \u201cbelow its potential\u201d due to higher interest rates constraining economic activity. He also noted that the full impact of the current monetary policy has yet to be realized. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the market is currently evenly divided on the possibility of another interest rate hike by the Fed in 2023.\n\nOn Oct. 3, the real yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys, a measure that adjusts for inflation, reached 2.47% \u2014 its highest level in nearly 15 years \u2014 according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department. This development partly explains the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) reaching its highest point in 10 months.\n\nAdditionally, Reuters reported that the U.S. has become a relatively more appealing investment destination due to its \u201cresilient economy,\u201d boasting stronger growth prospects when compared with Europe and China.\n\nBitcoin trading metrics show diminished activity for leverage longs\n\nBitcoin monthly futures typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, BTC futures contracts should typically trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe BTC futures premium continues to trade below the 5% neutral threshold, remaining in the neutral-to-bearish range. This indicates a lack of demand for leveraged long positions.\n\nAdditionally, spot trading activity on traditional exchanges has declined to levels not seen since late 2020, signifying reduced participation by institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin daily spot trading volume, USD. Source: Messari and Kaiko\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the decrease in trading volumes may be attributed to major U.S.-based trading firms, such as Jane Street Group and Jump Trading, distancing themselves from the cryptocurrency markets ahead of May 2023. Bloomberg reported that the primary reason for this shift was \u201cheightened regulatory scrutiny,\u201d which rendered the market less appealing to institutional investors.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price drops its early week gains \u2014 Here is why\n\nInvestors\u2019 expectation for a spot BTC ETF drops\n\nOne of the factors supporting Bitcoin\u2019s 68% gains in 2023 is the anticipation of approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, despite the regulator\u2019s multiple postponements, the recent launch of Ether futures-based ETFs on Oct. 2 saw lackluster demand.\n\nFurthermore, despite a favorable court ruling for the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, it continues to trade at a 19% discount compared with its Bitcoin holdings. This data indicates a lack of confidence in the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, as investors would have the option to redeem their shares at par value following the conversion.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin was unable to surpass the $28,500 resistance level, and Federal Reserve representatives warned of impending economic pressures. Consequently, the prospects of breaking above this resistance in the short term appear less than favorable.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "After sending out indications about Web5 and BitKey in June 2022, Block (NYSE: SQ) is officially launching its self-custody hardware wallet, BitKey.\n\nBenzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference, scheduled for Nov. 14, is poised to be a pivotal gathering for the digital assets community. The event will spotlight the latest trends, innovations, and challenges in the digital asset realm.\n\nWhat Happened: Global tech company Block will soon release its inaugural Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) hardware wallet, BitKey, publicly.\n\nThe goal is to provide additional layers of security and eliminating intermediary roles are the highlights of the product.\n\nThe news was announced via X. Many beta users highlighted the image of the wallet, which is like a compact hexagon. The device with a stone-like exterior also adds a fingerprint sensor increasing the layers of bitcoin security to the device. The launch comes amid the overall crypto industry facing security and governance issues.\n\nRead Now: Top Of The Crypto Pack - MetaMask Leads Crypto Wallets In Monthly Visits, Named One Of Year's Best\n\nBitKey, a multi-signature self-custody Bitcoin wallet, will feature a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools. Add, send, receive and transfer are the facilities available by BitKey. The transfer of Bitcoin to BitKey is facilitated from exchange partners \u2014 Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Cash App \u2014 safely without the conflict of standard copy and paste. Users can also buy Bitcoin through third-party partners who provide this service integrated into the BitKey app.\n\nWhy It Matters: Co-founder Jack Dorsey has emphasized the need for user autonomy over the user\u2019s Bitcoin assets. BitKey will let users securely manage their Bitcoin holdings without the interference of an intermediary.\n\nThe hardware wallet is expected to allow users to control their private keys thereby avoiding the risk of losses in customer assets.\n\nDorsey had expressed last year the idea of BitKey along with his Web5 idea, a new decentralized Web, centered on Bitcoin. Web5 will be the combination of Web3 and Web2. Unlike Web3, which relies on blockchain and tokenization technology to decentralize the network, Web5\u2019s entire dependence will be on a single network, Bitcoin, and without any intermediary who can control user data. BitKey could be the key to this new web.\n\nFind out more on Web3, Web2, and other blockchain platforms. Meet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets. Tickets are flying: Get yours!\n\nThe product disclosure comes on the heels of Jack Dorsey recently posing tech giant, Apple a question on platform X (earlier Twitter) as to why it does not support Bitcoin. Apple did not respond to the same. However, discussions on the web spread that if Apple adopts Bitcoin, it would be regarded as the queen of crypto.\n\nMajor players in the industry are also looking to onboard Bitcoin in the major financial stream. PayPal is looking to make Bitcoin into a worldwide payment network and Coinbase added Lightning support prioritizing Bitcoin.\n\nAlso Read: Ledger Teams Up With PayPal To Streamline Bitcoin, Ether Purchases\n\nImage: Flickr\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The bitcoin miner Riot raked in the record profits by reducing power use at its Texas facilities to earn energy credits from the state throughout the summer. Matthew T. Carroll/Getty Images\n\nThe Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) paid cryptocurrency mining company Riot around $2.5 million to cut its energy use in September. The payouts come after Riot announced that it made more than $31 million in payments from the state's energy grid operator during August, as an extreme heat wave pushed the grid to multiple peak demand records.\n\n\u201cSeptember represented another significant month for Riot as we were able to clearly demonstrate the value of Bitcoin mining while contributing to the stability of the ERCOT electrical grid,\u201d Jason Les, CEO of Riot, said in a Wednesday release.\n\nRiot earned the $2.5 million in energy credits in September through ERCOT's \"demand response\" programs, which offer payouts to high-power-use entities like bitcoin mining companies to cut usage during peak demand periods. ERCOT also relies on bitcoin miners like Riot to use more power during periods of excessive supply to stabilize energy prices, according to CNBC.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Colorado-based company pulled in another $11 million in power credits in September by selling prepurchased energy to the retail energy supplier TXU, per the Dallas Morning News' Irving Mejia-Hilario."

Illustration: Rafael Henrique/SOPA/LightRocket/Getty (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin's price has seen a notable increase in the past week. The rise has been driven in some part by a dynamic between short and long-term bitcoin holders, according to an analyst.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has risen by 4.5% in the past week, now changing hands at $27,602, (\u00a322,771) according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThis is a retrace from a height of $28,500, that was reached on Monday. The early October high marked a significant price point that has not been reached since August 17, 2023.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\n\"Bitcoin now finds itself in a technical range, confined between the resistance level of $28,500 and the support level of $27,100,\" CryptoQuant analyst Adam Mourad told Yahoo Finance UK.\n\nUnderlying market dynamics driving the bitcoin price\n\nThe analyst explained the underlying factors that could be at play. Mourad described a market dynamic that has developed between short and long-term bitcoin holders. He referred to on-chain metrics that demonstrated long-term holders acquiring the digital assets that are being sold by short-term holders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The supply held by short-term holders has dipped to its lowest point in nearly eight years, a level not seen since November 2015, with a value of 3.8 million bitcoins,\" the analyst said.\n\nConversely, the CryptoQuant analyst referred to on-chain data that showed the supply of bitcoin held by long-term holders has reached an all-time high, standing at 15.6 million bitcoins.\n\nHe added that long-term holders have a deeper belief in the asset and will hold and accumulate the asset. A dynamic that favours price appreciation.\n\nRead more: SBF defense in FTX trial: 'There was no theft'\n\nFormer BlackRock executive updates forecast on spot bitcoin ETFs\n\nLong-term holders of bitcoin wait in hopeful anticipation that an approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by US regulators is forthcoming.

        "title": "A Comprehensive Guide To Why Is Bitcoin Volatile - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price volatility arises from supply and demand shocks, its scarcity, and the macro environment that it is disrupting.\n\nFactors like market maturity, regulation, technology, adoption, and reduced bear market crashes may stabilize Bitcoin\u2019s volatility.\n\nPredicting Bitcoin\u2019s future price is complex due to sentiment, adoption, tech changes, and external events.\n\nVolatility offers trading opportunities, long-term investment potential, price discovery, and fosters education and awareness.\n\nWhy Is Bitcoin Volatile?\n\nIn 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the Bitcoin white paper . By 2009, the initial value of Bitcoin blockchain was only a fraction of a cent, reflecting the cost of electricity used to mine the first few million coins. However, a single Bitcoin\u2019s valuation soon rose to $0.09c .\n\nBitcoin has since come a long way providing real-time global market value through its decentralized network, allowing users to track transactions and account balances with unparalleled transparency. The cryptocurrency is governed by a protocol and open-source software which ensures security and reliability of the system.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy self-induces supply shocks called the halvings every four years, reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created enhancing its scarcity principles, making it an attractive store of value for investors. Due to its startup nature, with just a 14 year lifecycle, Bitcoin is also known for its volatility in price swings making it a highly speculative asset. Here are some reasons for Bitcoins Volatility:\n\nDemand And Supply\n\nThe prices of most commodities like precious metals are primarily shaped by the forces of supply and demand. Bitcoin\u2019s market value is mainly influenced by the supply of coins in circulation and the willingness of individuals to invest. With a predefined limit of 21 million coins that will ever exist, and 19.5 million coins currently in circulation the supply is being constricted each market cycle, also known as the halving which occurs every four years.\n\nScarcity\n\nIn the United States, there are approximately 22 million officially recognized millionaires , indicating that there isn\u2019t sufficient Bitcoin for each millionaire to possess a whole coin. Bitcoin serves as a store of value, and in times of geopolitical uncertainty, when businesses or individuals seek to protect their assets, the demand for Bitcoin will continue to rise. This heightened demand, coupled with its limited supply, can lead to significant price volatility.\n\nMarket Speculation\n\nBitcoin, being relatively new in the financial landscape, is highly susceptible to speculative trading. Traders often respond to market sentiment rather than fundamental factors, leading to rapid price swings.\n\nLack Of Institutional Regulation\n\nUnlike traditional financial markets, Bitcoin operates with minimal regulatory oversight in many regions. This absence of institutional control makes it susceptible to sudden large trades or speculative bubbles, with large upside but also extreme bear downsides, contributing to volatility.\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nInvestor sentiment can be a significant driver of Bitcoin\u2019s price swings. Positive news or endorsements can lead to price rallies, while negative developments can trigger sharp declines, reflecting its sensitivity to external sentiment factors. The halving is deemed to be a bullish event because its presence amplifies the education surrounding Bitcoins scarcity.\n\nWhale Behavior\n\nBitcoin whales, with substantial holdings, can impact the market significantly. Their buying or selling decisions can lead to cascading effects, amplifying price volatility as other investors react. For example, if each millionaire wants one coin the price of each coin will increase because each millionaire will have to outbid the other leading to volatility.\n\nExternal Events\n\nGeopolitical tensions, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic factors can influence Bitcoin\u2019s volatility. As Bitcoin is considered a hedge against traditional financial systems, any events that threaten these systems can lead to increased demand, driving up prices, or panic-selling, causing abrupt drops.\n\nLost Bitcoin\n\nVarious estimates suggest that a significant number of Bitcoins have been lost over the years due to a variety of reasons. Estimates suggest that a significant portion of the total Bitcoin supply, possibly 4 million Bitcoins or more, has been permanently lost.\n\nThese lost coins reduce the effective supply of Bitcoin in circulation, further amplifying its price volatility. As the demand for this digital asset surges, its relatively limited supply, exacerbated by the prevalence of lost coins, can result in sharp price fluctuations.\n\nWill Bitcoin Remain Volatile Over The Next 14 Years?\n\nBitcoin is likely to hold a degree of volatility that will always be present in the Bitcoin market, but the extent and nature of that volatility can evolve over time. Here are some key considerations that argue a more stable price in the future:\n\nMarket Maturity\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to mature and attract more institutional investors and widespread adoption, it\u2019s possible that its price volatility could decrease. Established financial instruments, such as futures and options markets, can also help stabilize prices by providing tools for risk management.\n\nRegulation\n\nIncreased regulatory oversight and clarity can bring more stability to the market by reducing uncertainty and deterring manipulative practices. However, excessive regulation can stifle innovation and adoption, so it\u2019s a delicate balance.\n\nTechnological Advances\n\nImprovements in blockchain technology, scalability solutions, and the development of second-layer protocols (e.g., Lightning Network) could enhance Bitcoin\u2019s utility as a medium of exchange, potentially reducing its speculative volatility.\n\nMarket Adoption\n\nWider adoption of Bitcoin in everyday transactions can reduce its dependence on speculative trading and increase price stability. As it becomes more commonly used as a currency, its price may stabilize.\n\nExternal Factors\n\nGeopolitical events, economic crises, and global financial instability can still impact Bitcoin\u2019s price, contributing to volatility. These factors are challenging to predict or control.\n\nBear Market Crashes Are Reducing\n\nThe Bitcoin chart below illustrates the historical behavior of price crashes during past bear markets, revealing the substantial percentage drops in value. In the first bear market, the price experienced an 85% decrease, followed by an 83% drop in the second one, and a 76% decline in the third.\n\nLooking ahead, there is a prevailing expectation that this pattern of decreasing percentage drops may persist in the future, potentially signifying a gradual reduction in overall market volatility along with this reduction. This trend suggests that as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin continue to mature and gain wider acceptance, they may become more resilient to extreme price fluctuations, ultimately leading to a more stable investment landscape.\n\nBitcoin Is Still In Its Infancy\n\nBitcoin is still a relatively new concept and young asset class and in the process of price discovery. Consequently, its value is subject to continuous adjustments as investors, users, and governments grapple with initial challenges and uncertainties, making it an evolving and dynamic asset class.\n\nHow Can Bitcoin Volatility Be Beneficial To The Individual?\n\nWhilst volatility can be initially viewed as a challenge it may also present itself as a huge opportunity to learn more about markets and churn out gains in the process. Some benefits behind volatility include:\n\nTrading Opportunities\n\nVolatility creates frequent price swings, offering traders opportunities to profit from both upward and downward movements. Skilled traders can employ strategies such as day trading, swing trading, or arbitrage to capitalize on these price fluctuations.\n\nLong-Term Investment In A Speculative Asset\n\nSome investors embrace Bitcoin\u2019s volatility as a long-term investment strategy. They buy and hold, believing in the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential for significant appreciation over time, despite the short-term price fluctuations.\n\nPrice Discovery\n\nVolatility assists in the price discovery process, as it reflects changing market sentiments and information. This can lead to more accurate and efficient pricing over time.\n\nEducation And Awareness\n\nThe Bitcoins market\u2019s volatility often attracts media attention, fostering education and awareness to the digital asset class and to blockchain technology.\n\nChallenges And Risks Associated With Volatility\n\nThere are some inherent risks surrounding volatility that an individual should mitigate against. These include:\n\nInvestment Risk\n\nHigh volatility means that Bitcoin\u2019s price can change rapidly, leading to significant gains or losses for investors. This risk can be a deterrent for some investors.\n\nUse As A Currency\n\nVolatility can make Bitcoin less suitable as a medium of exchange or store of value, as its value may fluctuate significantly over short periods.\n\nRegulatory And Institutional Concerns\n\nExtreme volatility can raise concerns among regulators and institutional investors, potentially leading to increased regulatory scrutiny or hesitation to invest.\n\nConsumer Confidence\n\nRapid price swings can erode consumer confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s stability and usability for everyday transactions and overall belief.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility is a hallmark of its health within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, reflecting its disruptive nature and its potential to reshape the world of finance as we know it. This dynamic characteristic draws traders, investors, and innovators, propelling the evolution of the digital asset landscape.\n\nAs such, the perception of Bitcoin\u2019s volatility varies among market participants, with its significance evolving over time in tandem with the cryptocurrency ecosystem\u2019s development.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhy Is Bitcoin Volatile?\n\nIts price is mainly influenced by supply and demand dynamics, scarcity, speculative trading, lack of institutional regulation, market sentiment and the prevalence of lost Bitcoins, among others.\n\nWill Bitcoin Remain Volatile Over The Next 14 Years?\n\nFactors like market maturity, regulation, technological advancements, increasing adoption, and a historical trend of decreasing percentage drops in bear market crashes suggest the potential for a more stable price environment in the future.\n\nHow High Can The Price Of Bitcoin Reach?\n\nPredicting the future price of Bitcoin remains uncertain and challenging. Bitcoin\u2019s price is subject to various factors, including market sentiment, adoption, technological advancements, and external events.\n\nHow Can Bitcoin Volatility Be Beneficial To The Individual?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility presents trading possibilities for profit, long-term investment potential, aiding price discovery, and fostering education and awareness."

        "content": "In the heart of El Zonte, El Salvador, a profound transformation is underway, captivating the global Bitcoin community. Bitcoin Beach, an innovative initiative, has not only changed lives but also paved the way for El Salvador's historic Bitcoin legal tender law. The documentary \"Dare to Dream: A Story From El Salvador,\" directed by Joe Delahunty, along with producer and funder Graham Rittener, unravels the true narrative behind this groundbreaking movement, dispelling myths and showcasing the transformative power of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nOn a visit to El Zonte, Rittener was inspired by the work Bitcoin Beach and Hope House were doing to improve their community. He noticed that although there is a lot of technical and macroeconomic content, there was a gap in covering the human stories behind Bitcoin, especially regarding the rise of Bitcoin Beach. Rittener, especially saw the positive aspect that Bitcoin was having in changing people's lives. He also wanted to make the content relevant not just to Bitcoiners but to the general public as a whole through qualitative stories that they could connect with.\n\nTo that end, it was important that the film took the audience through answering the question of \"what is money?\" Here, Bitcoin philosopher and podcaster Robert Breedlove, in a friendly and accessible manner, guides the audience through this complex question.\n\nThe Genesis of Bitcoin Beach\n\n\"Dare to Dream\" illuminates the origins of Bitcoin Beach, dispelling the mystery that surrounded its inception. With meticulous precision, Delahunty traces the roots of this groundbreaking movement, unearthing untold stories that led to an unprecedented financial revolution in El Zonte.\n\nThe film vividly portrays Bitcoin's potential, surpassing mere speculation. Through intimate vignettes, we witness the profound impact of Bitcoin as a tool, liberating El Zonte from violence and despair, offering a beacon of hope, and a chance for young individuals to remain rooted in their community.\n\nAs the legal tender law gained momentum, what began as a grassroots movement got entangled in political debate. The media frenzy threatened to misrepresent Bitcoin Beach, yet at its core, the project remained steadfast, apolitical, and a testament to the enduring power of community-driven initiatives.\n\nPersonal Journeys: Hopes, Dreams, and Love for Community\n\n\"Dare to Dream\" introduces us to the individuals who birthed Bitcoin Beach, giving voice to their aspirations and love for family, community, and country. Roman Martinez (Chimbera) and Jorge Valenzuela, lifelong friends turned trailblazers, candidly share why Bitcoin became a lifeline. The film also unravels the enigmatic story of the anonymous Bitcoin funder, shedding light on how Mike Peterson, in collaboration with Chimbera and Valenzuela, turned this vision into reality.\n\nDocumentary still shot provided by Joe Delahunty.\n\nThe educational efforts by Chimbera and Valenzuela went beyond Bitcoin, equipping the community with technical knowledge to navigate Lightning Bitcoin wallets and bridging the gap for an unbanked non-technical audience, tailoring the education and wallet solutions to suit unique community needs.\n\nThe educational facet became a catalyst for holistic empowerment, extending to English language classes and diverse skill-building initiatives. Surfing, soccer, art, and drama classes emerged as strategic investments in the personal development of the community's future leaders.\n\nDocumentary still shot provided by Joe Delahunty.\n\nMultifaceted Realities: El Salvador's Bitcoin Adoption\n\n\"Dare to Dream\" features the testaments of renowned figures in the Bitcoin space, providing a unique perspective on the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin adoption. Max Keiser, who relocated to El Salvador and committed significant resources, shares some of his insights on Bitcoin adoption, while Nicolas Burtey, CEO of Galoy, emphasizes the role of Lightning as a means to empower communities. The documentary also shows podcaster John Vallis conducting interviews with locals and industry players.\n\nAdditionally, the film delves into a comprehensive exploration of how Bitcoin is integrating into the fabric of Salvadoran society. It reveals a tapestry of benefits beyond digital currency, from innovative remittance methods to a burgeoning tourism boom and merchant empowerment through reduced fees.\n\nDocumentary still shot provided by Joe Delahunty.\n\nA Beacon of Possibility\n\nWhile audiences are required to pay to view the film, it was created as a non-profit project, and if the film makes any profit, 90% of the proceeds will go directly to help the educational outreach efforts of Bitcoin Beach and Hope House.\n\n\"Dare to Dream: A Story From El Salvador\" is a powerful testament to Bitcoin's potential to bring tangible change. It transcends borders, representing a beacon of possibility for a more inclusive and prosperous world. Every Bitcoiner and anyone intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin should witness this story, for it is not just about Bitcoin but about the people, their dreams, and the hope for a better future. The film is a reminder that just as Jorge and Chimbera are changing their world, we are also encouraged to dare to dream and change ours.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: \"Dare to Dream: A Story From El Salvador\" can be streamed on Apple TV, Prime Video, YouTube Movies, Google Play, Vudu, and others in the United States; Apple TV, YouTube Movies, and Google Play in Canada; Apple TV in the Caribbean; Amazon UK in the United Kingdom; and Vimeo in all other countries. If you\u2019re outside the US, Canada, and the Caribbean, you can purchase the documentary using Bitcoin.

        "title": "What is the Bitcoin Halving and Why Does it Matter? - BSC NEWS",
        "content": "During Bitcoin mining, the reduction in mining rewards is hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol and serves two main purposes: to control the supply of new Bitcoins entering circulation and to combat inflation.\n\nDemystifying Bitcoin Halving - The Core of Bitcoin's Scarcity\n\nBitcoin halving is considered one of the most significant events in cryptocurrency evolution. It involves reducing the rewards awarded to miners who play a vital role in securing the network.\n\nAs we approach the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected in April or May 2024, it is essential to comprehend the event's profound implications. This article seeks to answer the fundamental question: What is Bitcoin halving, and how it works?\n\nThe Foundation: Bitcoin's Blockchain Network\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin's underlying technology is crucial before diving into its mechanics. Bitcoin's blockchain is a complex network of computers called nodes. These nodes collectively run Bitcoin's software and maintain a comprehensive ledger of all historical transactions within the network.\n\nTransactions within the Bitcoin network undergo a rigorous validation process. Instead of being verified individually, transactions are grouped into blocks. Only when an entire block is validated are the transactions within it considered confirmed. As these transactions are validated, they become permanent additions to the blockchain, distributed among all nodes.\n\nHowever, more participating computers or nodes are added to enhance the blockchain's stability and security. While anyone with sufficient storage can become a node by downloading the entire blockchain history, not all nodes are miners.\n\nNow let\u2019s understand about Bitcoin halving and how it works.\n\nHalving Bitcoin: What is it and How Does it Work?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is a pivotal event in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies, occurring approximately every four years. This event, encoded into Bitcoin's very DNA, involves the halving of rewards for Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe fundamental purpose of Bitcoin halving is to combat inflation by preserving the cryptocurrency's inherent scarcity. In theory, the reduction in the rate of Bitcoin issuance is expected to lead to price appreciation, provided that demand remains constant.\n\nAt present, Bitcoin maintains an inflation rate of less than 2%, a figure that is set to further decrease with future halvings. Comparatively, in the US, the inflation rate for 2022 was 8%.\n\nBut how does this mechanism operate, and why does Bitcoin halving matter?\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Process\n\nIt is essential to understand Bitcoin mining in order to understand Bitcoin halving. Miners are pivotal participants who compete to add new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn order to achieve this, specialized hardware solves intricate mathematical problems, generating a unique 64-character output called a \"hash.\" Once the block is sealed, it becomes immutable and cannot be altered. As a reward for their efforts, miners are compensated with Bitcoin.\n\nSo, how exactly does the Bitcoin halving cycle function? The reward for successfully mining a block was 50 BTC at the time of Bitcoin's inception. Incentives like these were instrumental in motivating early users to join the network, even before its widespread success.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin's design incorporated a deliberate reduction in the rate of new Bitcoin creation, precisely halving it for every 210,000 blocks mined. This equates to approximately every four years.\n\nAccording to historical Bitcoin halving dates, the last three halvings occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020. The inaugural Bitcoin halving occurred in 2012, marking the reduction of mining block rewards from 50 to 25 BTC. Subsequent to this, the 2016 halving event further reduced incentives to 12.5 BTC for each block mined. As of May 11, 2020, every newly mined block generates a mere 6.25 new BTC.\n\nAnticipated in April 2024, the next Bitcoin halving will persist until roughly 2140, coinciding with the point at which all Bitcoin will have been mined.\n\nThe Purpose and Significance of Bitcoin Halving\n\nBut why does Bitcoin halving hold such pivotal significance? There are two primary reasons:\n\n1. Scarcity and Controlled Supply: Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, envisioned a digital currency with constrained and managed supply. Halving the mining rewards by half effectively diminishes the rate at which new Bitcoin is brought into existence. With escalating scarcity over time, Bitcoin becomes a deflationary asset in the long run.\n\n2. Inflation Control: Bitcoin halving plays an instrumental role in curbing excessive inflation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. By reducing the block reward, the process restricts the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the market. Controlled issuance maintains the long-term value and stability of the coin.\n\nAre you wondering why this Bitcoin halving represents a bullish trend in the crypto world? Let's find out.\n\n\u200d\n\nWhy Bitcoin Halving is Bullish\n\nMarket participants have consistently responded to halving events with fervent buying. The decrease in the inflation rate intensifies the pressure of demand, propelling Bitcoin's price upward.\n\nInterestingly, this phenomenon extends beyond Bitcoin, as other cryptocurrencies have experienced substantial gains during these periods, underlining the broader market's recognition of the bullish potential unlocked by Bitcoin halving.\n\nA Glimpse into Historical Halving Cycles\n\nNow, let's delve into the historical perspective by examining the price movements during each Bitcoin halving cycle:\n\nFirst Halving Cycle (November 2012 - July 2016):\n\nLowest Price: $12.4 (December 2012)\n\nHighest Price: $1,170 (November 2013)\n\nSecond Halving Cycle (July 2016 - May 2020):\n\nLowest Price: $535 (August 2016)\n\nHighest Price: $19,400 (December 2017)\n\nThird Halving Cycle (May 2020 - April 2024):\n\nLowest Price: $8,590 (May 2020)\n\nHighest Price: $67,450 (November 2021)\n\nAs we can see, halving events have historically correlated with Bitcoin's price surges. The anticipation of reduced supply and increased demand often generates positive market sentiment and potential price appreciation.\n\nIt is imperative, though, to bear in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results, and various factors beyond halving events contribute to Bitcoin's price dynamics.\n\n\u200d\n\nPredicting the Future of Bitcoin's Price: Insights from Experts\n\nAs the pioneer and largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin's price predictions garner substantial attention from experts and enthusiasts alike as the halving approaches. Lets delve into some of the diverse perspectives offered by prominent figures in the crypto space.\n\nBitQuant's Bullish Forecast: $250,000 Target\n\nBitQuant, a renowned social media commentator, has set an ambitious target for Bitcoin's price. According to this prediction, Bitcoin is expected to reach $250,000 after its next block subsidy halving.\n\nNo, #Bitcoin is not going to top before the halving.\n\nYes, it's going to reach a new all-time high before the halving.\n\nNo, #BTC is not going to $160K because the magnitude of every pullback is large. This means it will peak after the halving, in 2024. And yes, the target price is\u2026 pic.twitter.com/TRcEB4DFpF \u2014 BitQuant (@BitQua) September 15, 2023\n\nJesse Myers' Halving-Driven Outlook\n\nBitcoin investor and author Jesse Myers offers a more conservative outlook. Myers posits that Bitcoin will only breach the six-figure mark after its 2024 block subsidy halving. As a result, he believes that significant price movements might occur after this key milestone, as the market needs to fully \"price in\" the effects of the halving.\n\n#Bitcoin won't surge to $100k before the next halving...\n\n\n\nBecause the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is wrong.\n\n\n\nInstead, the market will price-in the changed reality over the 12-18 months post-halving. \u2014 Jesse Myers \ud83d\ude80 The Bitcoin Simplifier (@Croesus_BTC) August 14, 2023\n\nMarshall Beard, the chief strategy officer at crypto exchange Gemini, shared his optimism about Bitcoin's price trajectory. He believes that Bitcoin has the potential to surpass its all-time highs in the current year. In particular, he mentions the $100,000 figure, suggesting Bitcoin could achieve this milestone if it reaches its previous record high of nearly $69,000.\n\nPaolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer at Tether, echoes this positive sentiment. He suggests that Bitcoin could \"retest\" its all-time high of around $69,000, signaling potential for price appreciation.\n\nStandard Chartered's Research-Based Prediction\n\nStandard Chartered, a prominent British multinational bank, has recently revised its prediction for Bitcoin's price. In one of its research reports, the bank anticipates Bitcoin's price to range between $100,000 to $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nThis upward revision is attributed to the bank's belief in increased profitability for Bitcoin miners. Additionally, the bank forecasts Bitcoin to reach $50,000 by the end of the current year.\n\nBold Visions from Samson Mow and Balaji Srinivasan\n\nSamson Mow, a Chinese-Canadian Bitcoin entrepreneur and CEO of crypto firm JAN3, envisions an even more remarkable future for Bitcoin. He firmly believes that Bitcoin will surge to an astonishing $1 million within the next five years.\n\nOn the other hand, Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former technology chief at Coinbase, has taken a daring bet on Bitcoin's price. He also speculates that Bitcoin could reach $1 million or more in the coming days.\n\n\u200d\n\nBitcoin Halving's Influence\n\nThe phenomenon of Bitcoin halving is far from a mere technical adjustment; it carries significant economic implications for Bitcoin miners and the broader cryptocurrency market. As the block reward is halved, miners are compelled to reconfigure their operations to maintain profitability. This intensified competition, however, leads less efficient miners to exit the scene, which can have far-reaching effects on security.\n\nCrypto experts acknowledge the current economic landscape characterized by rising hikes and tighter monetary policies, factors that might not facilitate an immediate, sharp rebound for Bitcoin.\n\nWhile some foresee Bitcoin reaching unprecedented heights, others adopt a more cautious approach. This diversity of perspectives adds to the intrigue surrounding Bitcoin's price trajectory, making investors and enthusiasts eager to see what comes next."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is beating inflation better than the United States dollar, the U.S. Federal Reserve says \u2014 but unintentionally.\n\nIn a blog post first released in June 2022 and since updated, the St. Louis Fed compares buying eggs with BTC compared to dollars \u2014 still with surprising results.\n\nBitcoin vs. U.S. dollar: \u201cEggflation\u201d has gone nowhere\n\nBitcoin hodlers arguably have many better use cases for their BTC holdings than buying eggs, but that is the topic of a dedicated Fed blog post that attempts to demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s uncompetitive buying power versus the dollar.\n\nTo do so, its anonymous author measured the price of a dozen eggs in BTC and U.S. dollars since January 2021.\n\n\u201cThe price fluctuates quite a bit, between 2829 and 6086 [satoshis], which is much more than it did for the U.S. dollar price,\u201d the post concludes.\n\n\u201cPlus, you\u2019d need to add a bitcoin transaction fee, which has been about $2 lately, but which can spike above $50 on occasion. Hopefully, if you were making this purchase with bitcoin, you\u2019d put many many more eggs in your basket.\u201d\n\nThe charts included nonetheless show that since reaching a peak in both currencies in December 2022, the number of satoshis required to purchase the same dozen eggs has decreased more than the equivalent in U.S. dollars.\n\nBTC hodlers require 70% fewer sats for the purchase as of August 2023, the latest month for which Fed data is available, versus 58% fewer dollars.\n\nAverage price of a dozen eggs in satoshis chart (screenshot).

        "content": "Argo Blockchain is joining the list of publicly traded cryptocurrency miners whose production increased in September. One of the main players in the crypto mining sector mined 136 Bitcoin or Bitcoin Equivalents (BTC) last month, averaging 4.5 BTC per day. This represents an uplift of 34% compared to August 2023. Additionally, the company saw an uptick of 23% in mining revenue, amounting to $3.59 million.\n\nA Closer Look at Argo's September Performance\n\nArgo Blockchain's September performance was bolstered by a reduction in power costs, thanks to accrued power credits from economic curtailment. These credits have reduced the company's electricity expenses and improved its mining margins and cash flow. The boost in BTC mined is primarily attributed to fewer curtailment hours at the company's Helios facility.\n\nHowever, the growth in Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term production was slightly offset by an increase of 4% in the average network difficulty in September compared to August. Despite this, the company enhanced its mining revenue by 23%, reaching $3.59 million for the month.\n\nAs of 30 September 2023, Argo Blockchain held 32 BTC in its reserves. This is a decrease from the 49 BTC it held at the end of August. The drop is mainly due to the periodic revaluation of the company's non-Bitcoin digital asset holdings.\n\nRegarding infrastructure, Argo completed the deployment of its BlockMiner machines in September. These machines contribute approximately 0.3 EH/s to the company's hashrate capacity at its Quebec facilities. With this addition, Argo's total hashrate Hash Rate A hash rate is the measure of a cryptocurrency miner\u2019s performance and a key security metric.

In addition, Finance Magnates reported yesterday (Wednesday) that Bitfarms Ltd. Successfully mined 411 BTC, representing an improvement of 7.3% from the previous month.\n\nWhile the growth compared to August is undeniable, the results are still considerably modest when compared to September of last year. Argo's report from September 2022 shows that the company mined 215 BTC, which is 79 more than the current figure.\n\nThe same applies to the previously mentioned Bitfarms. Although the company reached its highest production rate since May in September 2023, it was still 70 BTC less than the previous year. This has led more people to question whether cryptocurrency mining is still profitable."

        "content": "The relatively lackluster performance of nine new Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has prompted analysts at K33 Research to urge a \u201crotate back\u201d into Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn an Oct. 3 market report, analysts Anders Helseth and Vetle Lunde said that it\u2019s \u201ctime to pull the brakes on ETH and rotate back into BTC,\u201d with the initial trading volume of Ether futures ETFs only accounting for 0.2% of what the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) amassed on its first day of trading in October 2021.\n\nWhile the analysts noted that no one expected to see initial trading volume on the Ether futures ETFs \u201ccome anywhere close\u201d to that of the Bitcoin futures ETFs \u2014 launched amid a raging bull market \u2014 the underwhelming first-day numbers \u201cstrongly\u201d missed expectations.\n\nDay one trading of ETH futures ETFs accounted for just 0.2% of what BTC futures ETFs amassed in 2021.

        "title": "Does Bitcoin Adoption Hinge on its Price? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's first and most well-known cryptocurrency, has received a lot of attention due to its price volatility. While its price has fluctuated dramatically, many people worry whether Bitcoin's adoption and acceptance in mainstream banking and everyday transactions are purely dependent on its price performance.\n\nThe Price Volatility of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin's path has been characterized by dramatic price fluctuations. Bitcoin's price has been a rollercoaster ride since its birth in 2009, when it was almost worthless, to its all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April 2021. This instability has drawn both ardent supporters and harsh detractors.\n\nThe Price as an Attention Driver\n\nBitcoin price increases frequently attract the attention of the media, investors, and the general public. As the price of Bitcoin rises, it makes news, attracting more participants to the cryptocurrency field. The allure of large returns has fueled speculative investment and the growth of a thriving Bitcoin trading ecosystem.\n\nValue Store Perception\n\nMany supporters claim that Bitcoin's price volatility does not detract from its attractiveness, but rather adds to it. They see Bitcoin as a digital gold-like store of value, an asset that can safeguard wealth and hedge against inflation. Price volatility is viewed as a necessary trade-off for potential long-term advantages in this setting.\n\nBitcoin Adoption Influencing Factors\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin is important, several additional factors influence its adoption and incorporation into established financial systems:\n\nThe regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies differs greatly across countries. Uncertainty or stringent restrictions might dissuade enterprises and investors, but a clear and supportive regulatory environment can stimulate adoption.\n\nInfrastructure Development: The availability of user-friendly wallets, exchanges, and payment systems has a significant impact on Bitcoin's usage in daily transactions. Infrastructure development is required for widespread adoption.\n\nMerchant Acceptance: Widespread acceptance as a payment mechanism by businesses can drive Bitcoin's adoption for day-to-day transactions. Companies that accept Bitcoin payments, such as Tesla and Square, have gotten a lot of attention.\n\nUse Cases Beyond Speculation: Extending Bitcoin's use cases beyond investment is critical. Projects aimed at facilitating remittances, microtransactions, and decentralized finance (DeFi) are driving Bitcoin acceptance beyond its traditional role as a store of value.\n\nTraditional financial organizations, such as banks and investment firms, are gradually incorporating cryptocurrencies into their offerings. The involvement of institutional investors, as well as the creation of Bitcoin-based financial products, show that acceptance is expanding.\n\nBeyond the Price of Bitcoin\n\nThe journey of Bitcoin extends beyond its price as it develops into a multidimensional asset and technology:\n\nBitcoin as Digital Gold: The story of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" emphasizes its potential as a store of value, particularly in uncertain economic times.\n\nSmart Contracts: Layer-2 solutions for Bitcoin, like as the Lightning Network, aim to enable smart contracts and microtransactions, expanding its utility.\n\nEnhancements to Privacy: Innovations such as the Taproot upgrade aim to strengthen Bitcoin's privacy features, making it more fungible and resistant to surveillance.\n\nConcerns about the environment: The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining has aroused debate, resulting in a growing interest in greener solutions.\n\nInteroperability: Bitcoin's compatibility with other blockchain networks, as well as its ability to span multiple ecosystems, may increase its acceptance.\n\nThe Importance of Price Stability\n\nWhile Bitcoin's price volatility has been a defining feature, obtaining price stability is frequently regarded as a critical step toward wider acceptance in everyday transactions. In this setting, stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies linked to a stable asset such as the US dollar, have gained popularity.\n\nBitcoin as a Volatile Asset: The price volatility of Bitcoin renders it unsuitable for routine transactions. Consider buying a cup of coffee with an asset that has the potential to dramatically increase or drop in value within minutes.\n\nStablecoins for Everyday Transactions: Stablecoins give the stability required for everyday transactions. They allow users to conduct cryptocurrency transactions while avoiding the price volatility associated with Bitcoin and other volatile digital assets.\n\nBitcoin as a Reserve Asset: The role of Bitcoin as a reserve asset or store of value is consistent with its digital gold narrative. It may not replace traditional currencies, but it may act as a hedge against economic insecurity.\n\nTrends in Adoption and Integration\n\nSeveral trends imply that Bitcoin's acceptability in the financial environment is growing:\n\nInstitutional Investment: Institutional players such as Grayscale, MicroStrategy, and Tesla have made significant investments in Bitcoin, indicating their belief in its long-term potential.\n\nPayment Gateways: Payment processors such as PayPal have integrated Bitcoin into their platforms, making it possible for users to buy, hold, and spend Bitcoin at millions of businesses.\n\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Some central banks are considering producing digital currencies that may be interoperable with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nGlobal Remittances: Because Bitcoin is borderless, it is an appealing option for cross-border remittances, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional ways.\n\nBitcoin ATMs: The increasing number of Bitcoin ATMs throughout the world makes it easier for anyone to buy and trade Bitcoin.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi): By incorporating Bitcoin into DeFi applications, users can earn interest and access numerous financial services while keeping Bitcoin.\n\nChallenges and Threats\n\nDespite its rapid expansion, Bitcoin adoption faces a number of challenges:\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty: Evolving and sometimes contradictory regulatory frameworks might stymie Bitcoin adoption, especially in strict-regulation regions.\n\nScalability concerns with Bitcoin have resulted in sluggish transaction processing times and increased fees during moments of strong demand.\n\nSecurity Issues: Hacks, frauds, and security breaches continue to endanger cryptocurrency users and exchanges.\n\nEnvironmental Concerns: The high energy usage of Bitcoin mining has sparked controversy about its long-term viability.\n\nThe Inevitable Clash: Bitcoin vs. Central Bank Digital Currencies\n\nThe clash between Bitcoin and CBDCs is an impending showdown in the world of digital finance. CBDCs, touted for their stability and efficiency, come with a significant trade-off \u2013 a pervasive data trail. Unlike Bitcoin's pseudonymous transactions, CBDCs require users to undergo identification processes similar to those of traditional banks. This data is meticulously stored on central digital ledgers maintained by central banks, creating a comprehensive record of financial activities from cradle to grave.\n\nThis data collection raises substantial privacy concerns. Governments could gain unprecedented access to citizens' personal lives, including political affiliations and lifestyle choices, fundamentally undermining data privacy.\n\nFurthermore, CBDCs redefine ownership and control over digital currency. Unlike physical cash where individuals have full discretion, CBDC users hold digital cash in their name at central banks, with the middleman always mediating transactions. If the central bank declines a transaction, users have no recourse.\n\nCBDCs grant governments the power of programmability, allowing them to impose transaction restrictions, payment constraints, or spending limits. This newfound authority can be wielded to curtail specific purchases or block financial support for dissenting voices.\n\nIn this inevitable conflict, the concept of the \"veil of ignorance\" comes into play. It prompts us to consider not only the actions of our current governments but also those of future administrations. This introspection underscores the imminent threat CBDCs pose to global freedom, requiring us to carefully weigh the cost of innovation against individual liberties. Bitcoin, designed to be decentralized and pseudonymous, champions individual financial autonomy, making it a key player in this impending clash.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin has played an important role in fueling interest and speculation, its growth and acceptance in mainstream banking and everyday transactions are influenced by a broader set of circumstances. Bitcoin's development as an asset class, incorporation into financial systems, and maturing as a technology are all critical.\n\nStablecoins and other technologies that establish price stability can pave the road for Bitcoin's practical adoption in everyday transactions. However, its importance as a store of value, digital gold, and hedge against economic insecurity should not be overlooked.\n\nBitcoin's adoption will be dependent on a delicate combination of price stability, regulatory clarity, technological innovation, and its capacity to answer real-world financial demands as it continues to evolve and adapt to the changing financial landscape. Whatever its price, Bitcoin's journey is far from done, and its impact on the world of finance is just getting started."

        "content": "In an interview with Tom Bilyeu, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, shared an insightful analysis of the future dynamics he believes will shape the Bitcoin price. At the heart of Hayes\u2019 argument is a complex interplay of global financial mechanisms.\n\nBitcoin Price May Reach $750,000\n\nHayes began by setting the stage for Bitcoin\u2019s near-term movement, stating, \u201cMy working model is that we are going to continue chopping around $25,000 to $30,000 this year.\u201d This forecast draws its foundation from the anticipation of impending financial disturbances and Hayes alluded to the consequences of negative real rates.\n\nWhen nominal rates, driven by government policies, hover between 6% to 10%, he expects a wave of diversification in investment strategies. Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, stand to gain significantly from such a shift. \u201cAs we get to some kind of financial disturbance and people realize that real rates are negative, if governments are growing nominal at 10%, 5%, 6%, though it\u2019s high, people at the market will start buying other stuff. Crypto is one of those things,\u201d Hayes remarked.\n\nDelving deeper into the dynamics, Hayes extrapolated his prediction into 2024. He mentioned, \u201cEither we face a financial crisis where rates plummet to zero, or we experience a slower increase in rates compared to government expenditure.\u201d In both scenarios, Hayes anticipates a bullish outcome for Bitcoin, seeing it touch around the $70,000 mark by the end of 2024.\n\nKey drivers, in his opinion, would be the Bitcoin halving event, an algorithmic reduction in Bitcoin rewards that traditionally impacts its price, and potential Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) launches by significant asset management giants in strategic global financial hubs, including the US, Europe, China (through Hong Kong).\n\nThe longer-term prediction, however, is where Hayes\u2019 vision becomes even more expansive. He articulated, \u201cThis is where the real fun starts. In my mental model we can go somewhere between $750,000 to $1,000,000 per Bitcoin in the 2026 timeframe. Whatever the number is, it\u2019s going to be a round number, just like Bitcoin hit $69,999. Then it is going down and gets crashed. 75% or 80%, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nHayes firmly believes that such an evolution will come amidst an unparalleled financial boom. Moreover, Hayes\u2019 analysis is not confined to Bitcoin. Drawing parallels, he suggests that this monumental financial growth will cascade across other major assets. Indicators such as the NASDAQ and S&P, he suggests, will also see record-shattering performances.\n\n\u201cI think it will be the biggest boom in financial markets we have ever seen in human history. Bitcoin will have a ridiculous price, Nasdaq will have a ridiculous price, S&P will have a ridiculous price. Pick your stock industry. [\u2026] Not just in crypto,\u201d Hayes predicts.\n\nMoney Printer To Go \u201cBrrrr\u201d Soon?\n\nOn a separate note, Hayes expressed his thoughts on the broader macroeconomic climate, specifically pointing toward the US Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy in a series of tweets on Wednesday. He conveyed a belief that if the Fed were to return to its aggressive money printing strategies, it could become a significant catalyst for Bitcoin\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nOne of Hayes\u2019 core focuses was on an emergent phenomenon in the bond market called the \u201cbear steepener.\u201d This scenario, wherein long-term bond interest rates rise faster than their short-term counterparts, often serves as a bearish indicator for stocks and riskier assets. Hayes, diving into the complexities of this pattern, remarked in one of his tweets, \u201cWhy do I love these markets right now when yields are screaming higher? Bank models have no concept of a bear steepener occurring.\u201d\n\nExpanding on potential outcomes of a rapid bear steepener evolution, Hayes highlighted the risks. \u201cThe faster this bear steepener rises, the faster someone goes belly up, the faster everyone recognizes there is no way out other than money printing to save government bond markets,\u201d he pointed out, suggesting a potential domino effect that could send Bitcoin, crypto and all financial markets soaring.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $27,619.\n\nFeatured image from South China Morning Post, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Wrapped Crypto Tokens, Explained - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is a wrapped token? Tokens are wrapped to make them usable on a different blockchain or in a particular environment to which they are not native. A wrapped token is a sort of cryptocurrency or digital asset that is backed by another coin or asset, often one that is native to a particular blockchain or network, or that is \u201cwrapped\u201d by it. But why are wrapped tokens important? Wrapped tokens are especially beneficial for cross-chain interoperability and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. They enable users to take advantage of the various features and services provided on several blockchains by allowing assets from one blockchain to be used easily on another. Depending on the exact use case and architecture of the wrapping mechanism, wrapped tokens can represent a broad variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and even nonfungible tokens (NFTs). For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is a well-known example on the Ethereum network. But what is Wrapped Bitcoin? WBTC represents Bitcoin (BTC) and enables users to communicate with Ethereum-based DeFi protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) while preserving Bitcoin\u2019s intrinsic value and characteristics.\n\nHow do wrapped tokens work? When working with platforms for decentralized applications and DeFi that utilize many blockchains, wrapped tokens are very helpful. Here\u2019s how wrapped tokens work: Asset locking A specific amount of the native coin of one blockchain (such as Ethereum) is \u201clocked\u201d into a smart contract in order to generate a wrapped token. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or a trusted entity usually keeps an eye on this locking procedure. To create wrapped tokens, the locked native coin is used as collateral. Issuance of wrapped tokens After the original cryptocurrency is locked, a corresponding number of wrapped tokens are created or released on a different blockchain (for example, a wrapped version of Bitcoin known as wBTC is released on the Ethereum blockchain). Within the ecosystem of the second blockchain, these wrapped tokens, which stand in for ownership of the locked native coin, can be freely traded.\n\nTypes of wrapped tokens Various types of wrapped tokens include wBTC, wETH, stablecoin equivalents and blockchain-specific wrapped tokens. Wrapped tokens are designed to operate in harmony with particular blockchain settings, enabling the fusion of many assets into a single ecosystem. Wrapped Bitcoin, one of the many varieties of wrapped tokens, is a prime example; it enables BTC owners to use their holdings in Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications and on DeFi platforms. The Ethereum network is similarly made more efficient via Wrapped Ether (wETH), which facilitates trading and smart contract interactions. Similarly, stablecoins can be easily used across several blockchain ecosystems because of the wrapped equivalents of stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and Dai (DAI). Additionally, some blockchains host their own wrapped tokens, such as BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon, fostering cross-chain compatibility and enabling a variety of decentralized use cases. In the constantly changing cryptocurrency ecosystem, these tokens play a crucial role in bridging the gap between blockchain networks, improving liquidity, fostering interoperability and extending accessibility.\n\nWhat are the benefits of wrapped tokens? Wrapped tokens enhance cross-chain compatibility, liquidity and asset functionality, fostering a more interconnected and versatile cryptocurrency ecosystem. In the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, wrapped tokens offer advantages. Firstly, they promote cross-chain interoperability, enabling the seamless integration of assets from many blockchains into a specific ecosystem. This improves users\u2019 access to a greater variety of assets and liquidity. Secondly, wrapped tokens can make it easier to integrate assets with other functionality. For example, wBTC can be used to integrate Bitcoin into the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. They also standardize and simplify asset interactions, making them simpler to use. Additionally, wrapped tokens encourage decentralization by giving users more power over their assets. The utility, accessibility and adaptability of digital assets are significantly increased by these tokens across a variety of blockchain networks, encouraging a more connected and dynamic crypto economy."

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals becomes a hotbed of NFT trading, will the trend sustain? - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Ordinals grew faster in its early stages than NFTs launched on other networks.\n\nBitcoin clocked the third-highest NFT trading volume in the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nA year ago, nobody would have imagined Bitcoin [BTC] becoming a favored network for facilitating non-fungible token (NFT) transactions. However, things took a sharp turn in 2023 with Ordinals emerging as one of the year\u2019s biggest success stories in the blockchain space.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nOrdinals make a fantastic debut\n\nIn simple terms, Ordinals are NFTs that can be minted directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to NFTs on Ethereum [ETH], which point to off-chain data and rely on token standards to create a collection of tokens.\n\nOrdinals focus on BTC\u2019s smallest units, satoshis. The protocol allows users to inscribe each satoshi with data. This data can include smart contracts, which are then used to enable NFTs.\n\nIntroduced in January, Ordinals saw moderate growth in the first few months. However, the ecosystem has exploded since March, with nearly 35 million inscriptions getting minted until September, as per a report by blockchain analytics firm Galaxy Research.\n\nIt was worth noting that text-based inscriptions accounted for 95% of all mints. This was despite the fact that much of the hype surrounding Ordinals was fueled by digital artifacts or image-based files.\n\nHowever, when focusing just on image-based inscriptions, Bitcoin Ordinals grew faster in its early stages than NFTs launched on other networks.\n\nAs shown below, about 1.14 million digital artifacts were minted on Bitcoin during the first 200 days of activity. In contrast, Ethereum and Solana [SOL] experienced much slower minting activity on their respective networks since the debut of NFTs.\n\nOasis of growth amidst a NFT desert\n\nThe striking feature of Ordinals\u2019 growth trajectory was that it came during the NFT crypto winter. As part of the analysis, Galaxy Research noted,\n\n\u201cDespite the broader NFT market struggling to pull itself out of a bear market, Ordinals have gained significant traction and the idea of digital artifacts on Bitcoin has flourished.\u201d\n\nIndeed, NFT trade volumes dramatically plunged in 2023, with monthly figures steadily going downhill since the peak in February. However, amidst the gloom, Ordinals scripted a winning chapter.\n\nEvidently, Ordinals constituted 18% of all NFT volumes in May. And, although dropping out of the spotlight since then, Ordinals managed to provide a big impetus to Bitcoin\u2019s NFT activity.\n\nThe payments settlement network turned into a hot spot for trading digital artwork overnight. Bitcoin clocked the third-highest NFT trading volume in the first three quarters of 2023, eclipsing biggies like Polygon [MATIC] and trailing only Ethereum and Solana.\n\nOrdinals mania pushes up transaction fees\n\nOrdinals\u2019 frenzy also propelled network activity on the Bitcoin network to unprecedented levels. As mentioned earlier, Ordinals trading volume peaked in May, boosted majorly by the bulk minting of BRC-20 tokens.\n\nFor the uninitiated, BRC-20 is a token standard that enables users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network.\n\nBecause of the high demand for blockspace, a transaction jam choked the Bitcoin mempool. In fact, Galaxy Research noted that the jam hasn\u2019t cleared for about four months.\n\nThis was the longest running streak for a backlogged mempool since the bull run-induced spike in on-chain activity in 2021.\n\nThe increase in the number of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool prompted users to bid up fees in order to jump the queue. This is because miners would most likely include transactions with higher fees into the block and ignore the ones below a certain threshold.\n\nThe findings were verified by the dramatic increase in transactions and fees displayed in Glassnode\u2019s data above.\n\nA bright future ahead?\n\nWhile Ordinals had a promising debut, they still had a long way to go. Bitcoin\u2019s minting activity in the first 200 days was significantly less than other chains. The fact that other networks had experience and a well-developed ecosystem for NFT trades helped.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nMoreover, the BRC-20 standard was found to be an inefficient method to mint inscriptions as per the report. To make it easier for users, more efficient token standards were proposed.\n\nFurthermore, a substantial push was required to place a greater emphasis on minting image-based NFTs."

        "content": "A survey revealed that 87 per cent of Bitcoin owners frequently engage in cross-border remittances, highlighting the cryptocurrency's role in international money transfers.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted by tech firm Block founded by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, gathered data from 6,600 adults across 15 countries. It unveils insights into Bitcoin ownership, remittances, and global views on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe survey's key finding is the strong link between Bitcoin and remittance activity. Among Bitcoin owners, 87 per cent are part of households involved in cross-border remittances. This underscores Bitcoin's appeal for cost-effective and efficient international money transfers compared to traditional services.\n\nAdditionally, individuals engaged in remittances are more likely to own Bitcoin, with 8.9 per cent of them reporting ownership. This suggests that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred option for economical cross-border transactions.\n\nNotably, those involved in remittances are more optimistic about Bitcoin's future, with 56.2 per cent expressing optimism compared to 27.8 per cent among non-remittance participants. This implies that traditional banking's limitations, including data privacy and costs, are more apparent to those using it, making them open to Bitcoin.\n\nThe survey, spanning various countries, revealed consistent trends in Bitcoin ownership and remittance activity, emphasizing Bitcoin's growing role in facilitating cross-border money transfers.\n\nAs global connectivity increases, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are poised to play a more prominent role in cross-border remittances. Bitcoin's potential to offer faster, cheaper, and more private transactions aligns with the evolving needs of international money transfer participants.\n\nDespite varying regulatory and economic factors worldwide, Bitcoin's appeal as a tool for remittances remains strong, making a compelling case for its continued global adoption."

        "title": "Integrating Bitcoin into Your Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) Investment Strategy - SMSF Adviser",
        "content": "Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs) have long been a preferred choice for astute investors seeking greater control and flexibility over their retirement savings. The allure of SMSFs lies in their ability to empower individuals to shape their financial futures with autonomy and precision. For many, SMSFs represent not only a retirement nest egg but a canvas upon which they paint their financial dreams.\n\nIn recent years SMSF investors have been confronted with a paradigm shift in the investment landscape. The emergence of cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin at the forefront, has ignited a financial revolution, challenging traditional investment wisdom and beckoning SMSF trustees to explore new horizons.\n\nThe ATO's quarterly statistical report for March 2023 revealed Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) have embraced cryptocurrencies, amassing an asset allocation of over AU$1.5 billion. Trustees are now actively integrating cryptocurrencies into their investment portfolios, recognising the undeniable appeal of these digital currencies. In our ever-evolving financial landscape, it's impossible to overlook the allure of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin Diversification\n\nDiversification has long been a cornerstone of sound investment strategy, and in the context of Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs), it takes on a new dimension with the advent of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Here are some compelling advantages of considering Bitcoin as a component of your SMSF portfolio:\n\nPotential for High Returns: Bitcoin has garnered attention for its meteoric rise in value since its inception. While it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, Bitcoin has demonstrated the potential for significant returns, which can enhance the growth of your SMSF.\n\nHedge Against Traditional Markets: Bitcoin has shown a degree of independence from traditional financial markets. In times of economic turbulence or inflation concerns, Bitcoin may act as a hedge, diversifying your SMSF's risk exposure.\n\nAccess to Innovative Technology: Investing in cryptocurrencies provides exposure to innovative blockchain technology. This exposure can be particularly appealing for SMSF trustees looking to align their portfolios with technological innovation trends.\n\nGlobal Accessibility: Bitcoin is accessible 24/7, and transactions can be executed across borders without intermediaries. This global accessibility can be advantageous for SMSF investors looking to diversify beyond domestic assets.\n\nNavigating Cryptocurrency Regulations for Safe SMSF Investing\n\nWhen it comes to managing your Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF), it's essential to understand the regulatory framework, especially when considering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of your investment strategy. Here is a simplified guide to help you navigate these waters securely:\n\nRegulatory Environment Surrounding Cryptocurrencies in SMSFs:\n\nIn Australia, the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies has evolved over recent years. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) provides clear guidance on how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are taxed within SMSFs. To ensure your SMSF investment in Bitcoin is compliant:\n\nComplying with the Trust Deed and Investment Strategy: Your SMSF's trust deed must allow for cryptocurrency investments, and such investments should align with your fund's investment strategy.\n\nSole Purpose Test (SPT): This test ensures that the primary purpose of your SMSF is to provide retirement benefits to its members. Your cryptocurrency investments should align with this primary purpose.\n\nOwnership and Storage: Regulations specify how Bitcoin is owned and stored within an SMSF. The Digital Currency Exchange (DCE) account needs to be setup in the name of the SMSF, and cold storage devices need to be owned by the SMSF.\n\nImportance of Adhering to Tax and Regulatory Obligations:\n\nTax Implications: Cryptocurrency transactions within SMSFs can have tax implications, including capital gains tax (CGT) when selling cryptocurrencies. A significant advantage of a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) is the favourable tax regime it offers. SMSFs benefit from a concessional tax rate of 15%, and long-term capital gains are taxed at an effective rate of 10%. This tax rate is notably lower compared to standard individual marginal tax rates.\n\nRecord Keeping: Accurate and comprehensive record-keeping is essential. SMSF trustees should maintain records of all cryptocurrency transactions, including purchases, sales, and wallet movements, to demonstrate compliance with tax and regulatory obligations. Thankfully there are many tools available to help easily keep track of your cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nAnnual Audits: SMSFs are subject to annual audits. Cryptocurrency holdings and transactions must be transparently documented and available for audit purposes to ensure compliance.\n\nChoosing the Right Cryptocurrency Exchange\n\nIn the digital realm of cryptocurrency investments within Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs), selecting the right exchange is important. The cryptocurrency market offers a plethora of options, but not all are tailored to the unique needs of SMSF investors. Here's how you can make an informed choice:\n\nSMSF Integration: It's essential that the chosen exchange supports SMSF accounts, as these are unique to the Australian investment landscape. Many international platforms may not have the capacity to create accounts specifically tailored for SMSFs, making Australian exchanges a preferred choice for these investment vehicles. Ensuring SMSF integration simplifies the process of tracking and reporting cryptocurrency holdings within your SMSF portfolio.\n\nSecurity Measures: Security should be a paramount concern. Look for exchanges with robust security protocols, including cold storage for cryptocurrencies, two-factor authentication (2FA), and regular security audits.\n\nFees: Compare fee structures across different exchanges. Pay attention to trading fees, withdrawal fees, and any other charges that may impact the overall cost of your Bitcoin transactions. A clear understanding of the fee structure will help you manage your SMSF's costs effectively.\n\nAvailable Cryptocurrencies: While Bitcoin may be the primary focus of your SMSF, having access to a diverse range of cryptocurrencies can offer valuable diversification options. Examine the exchange's offerings and verify which cryptocurrencies are available for trading. A broader selection can provide you with flexibility to explore different investment opportunities within your SMSF.\n\nUser Experience: A user-friendly platform can significantly enhance your investment experience. Evaluate the exchange's interface for its ease of use and accessibility. Check for the availability of educational resources and support channels to assist users, particularly those new to cryptocurrency investments. A well-designed and user-centric exchange can simplify the process of managing your SMSF's cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nChoosing the right cryptocurrency exchange is a critical step in your SMSF's Bitcoin investment journey. At Digital Surge, we understand the unique requirements of Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) and have tailored our services to cater to these specific needs. Our platform is designed to provide SMSF investors with seamless access to a wide range of digital assets, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards while offering a user-friendly experience.

Here, we delve into the different approaches and underscore the importance of aligning your strategy with your SMSF's overarching financial goals.\n\nDifferent Approaches to Integrating Bitcoin:\n\nLong-Term Holding: This approach involves acquiring Bitcoin with the intention of holding it for an extended period, often years. Long-term holders believe in Bitcoin's potential to appreciate significantly over time. This strategy is typically less focused on short-term price fluctuations and more on the long-term growth of the asset.\n\nActive Trading: Active trading involves buying and selling Bitcoin with the aim of profiting from short-term price movements. Traders use various strategies, including technical analysis and market timing, to capitalize on price volatility. Active trading requires a deeper understanding of market dynamics and can be more time intensive.\n\nAligning the Investment Strategy with SMSF Goals:\n\nDefine Your Objectives: Before diving into Bitcoin investments, clearly define your SMSF's investment objectives. Are you seeking capital growth, income, or a combination of both? Understanding your goals will help shape your Bitcoin strategy.\n\nRisk Tolerance: Assess your SMSF's risk tolerance. Different strategies come with varying levels of risk. Long-term holding may be less risky but requires patience, while active trading can be riskier and demands more active management.\n\nDiversification: Consider how Bitcoin fits into your overall portfolio. Diversification across asset classes can help spread risk. Determine what percentage of your SMSF's assets you want to allocate to Bitcoin.\n\nTime Horizon: Your SMSF's time horizon plays a crucial role. If you have a long time until retirement, you may be more comfortable with a long-term holding strategy. Conversely, if you're nearing retirement, you might prefer a more conservative approach.\n\nReview and Adjust: Regularly review your strategy and its alignment with your SMSF's goals. Market conditions and your financial situation may change over time which may require adjustments to your Bitcoin investment strategy.\n\nProfessional Guidance:\n\nFinancial Advisors: Consult financial advisors who are well-versed in SMSF investments and cryptocurrencies. They can provide tailored guidance based on your SMSF's unique circumstances and goals.\n\nTax Advisors: Collaborate with tax advisors to ensure that your Bitcoin investment strategy aligns with your SMSF's tax obligations and minimises tax liabilities.\n\nDeveloping a sound Bitcoin investment strategy within your SMSF requires careful consideration of your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Whether you opt for long-term holding or active trading, the key is to stay aligned with your SMSF's overarching financial objectives and to adapt your strategy as needed to achieve those goals.\n\nKickstart your Journey to Financial Diversification\n\nReady to kickstart your journey to financial diversification?
