While the notion of Bitcoin and its ecosystem is exciting, there is one event that has played a big role in defining its ecology - the Bitcoin halving. We explore the subtleties of the halving event, studying its historical context and throwing light on its impact on cryptocurrency markets.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving, also known as the \"halvening,\" is a crucial event incorporated into the Bitcoin protocol's fabric. Halvings happen every four years and they reduce the rewards given to miners for validating transactions and protecting the Bitcoin network. The phrase \"halving\" refers to how these benefits are halved during this occurrence.\n\nThe History of Halving\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, initially suggested the concept of Bitcoin halving in the cryptocurrency's whitepaper. The first halving took place in 2012 when the block reward was decreased from 50 BTC to 25 BTC per Bitcoin block. Post halving, other successive halving occurred in 2016 (lowering prizes to 12.5 BTC) and 2020 (dropping rewards to 6.25 BTC). Each halving is scheduled to occur every 210,000 blocks mined.\n\nThe Purpose of Bitcoin Halving\n\nThe fundamental goal of Bitcoin halving \u2013 similarly to how it happens with many other crypto halvings \u2013 is to keep Bitcoin scarce and to limit its issuance pace, meaning Bitcoin price will likely be affected by it. Bitcoin's rate of production lowers when the rewards for miners are reduced, making it a deflationary digital asset, and thus limiting Bitcoin inflation. This scarcity mechanism is based on the notion that as supply gets more constrained, demand may rise, affecting the value of each Bitcoin unit.\n\nWhy Miners Get Rewards?\n\nMiners are essential to the Bitcoin network because they validate and add transactions to the blockchain. They are compensated for their efforts with newly created Bitcoins as well as transaction fees paid by users. These payouts encourage miners to invest in costly hardware, devote computational power, and safeguard the network.\n\nWhat Will Happen if Bitcoin Miners Drop?\n\nThe fall in payouts caused by halving occurrences can provide difficulties for miners. Miners must optimize their processes to be lucrative when there are fewer Bitcoins to mine. If a large number of miners abandon the network owing to lower payouts, the network's security may be jeopardized. However, historical data shows that the network adapts to these changes and that miners continue to participate.\n\nWhen is the Next BTC Halving Event?\n\nThe most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in 2020, at the time of writing. The next Bitcoin halving dates are expected to occur around this year 2024, with subsequent halving occurring roughly every four years. The cryptocurrency community is looking forward to this event since it is expected to have a significant impact on Bitcoin's value and the market as a whole.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin halving events are much more than just watershed moments in the history of a cryptocurrency. They exemplify scarcity, technology, and economics. The regulated drop in rewards affects not only miners but also the broader Bitcoin economy. As Bitcoin evolves, these halving events will become increasingly important for anyone interested in the digital currency space.\n\nFAQs\n\nWill BTC halving increase Bitcoins price?\n\nWhile historical patterns indicate that Bitcoin halving events have been linked to price increases, the relationship between halving and price is complex and influenced by a variety of factors. By looking at a Bitcoin halving chart one might try to understand BTC's expected price movements.\n\nHow many Bitcoin halvings are left?\n\nThere have already been three halvings, with a fourth set to occur around 2024. The block rewards will then become exceedingly minimal.\n\nWhat date is the next Bitcoin halving?\n\nThe precise timing of the next Bitcoin halving is determined by the block production rate and mining speed. It is expected to happen around 2024, based on past trends.\n\nWhat Happens If Bitcoins Run Out?\n\nA total of 21 million Bitcoins will be in circulation. Once all have been mined, miners will only get transaction fees as incentives, significantly altering the network's incentive structure.\n\nDo other cryptocurrencies also undergo halving?\n\nYes, halving events occur in a number of other cryptocurrencies, particularly ones based on the Proof of Work consensus process. Litecoin, for example, employs a halving method similar to that of Bitcoin.\n\nHow often Halving Occurs?\n\nBitcoin halving events occur every four years, or when 210,000 blocks are mined. This assures a gradual decrease in supply over time which is why many BTC enthusiasts almost seem to have a Bitcoin halving countdown."

        "content": "In the past decade, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index have risen 166% and 270%, respectively. Those are solid gains, to be fair, but they don't hold a candle to the world's oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's (BTC -0.44%) value has skyrocketed 4,830% in the past 10 years, translating to an annualized return of 74% per year. This means that a relatively small $4,000 investment 10 years ago would've made you a millionaire today.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how Bitcoin became one of the best financial assets to have owned, as well as what's in store.\n\nBecoming a legitimate financial asset\n\nAfter the first transaction was processed in 2009, Bitcoin was just an interesting niche computer program that software developers were drawn to. This \"internet money,\" which built upon previous technological breakthroughs, allowed two people anywhere in the world to instantly transfer value to each other without the need for an intermediary. This wasn't possible before.\n\nWhat's interesting about Bitcoin's rise was that it was first mainly driven by retail adoption, which isn't surprising, because its tiny early market value didn't provide the liquidity necessary for larger pools of capital. This is different from other financial assets, which usually start with institutional interest, with those who are closer to the actual market- and deal-making, like in equity markets or real estate, only reaching the average investor as development progresses.\n\nAfter nearly 15 years in existence, Bitcoin is slowly becoming a legitimate financial asset, if it isn't there already. Its current market cap of more than $500 billion is similar to major corporations like Visa and Eli Lilly. There are lots of businesses building financial infrastructure and tools to support Bitcoin and make it easier to access. It has the attention of regulatory agencies and politicians. And huge asset managers want in on the action with recent applications to create spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the path of Bitcoin's monster return certainly hasn't been a smooth ride. That's because like other cryptocurrencies, it's extremely volatile. Bitcoin has seen its price crash by 30% or more numerous times. The volatility has decreased as the asset has gotten more valuable, but it still trades like a growth tech stock, something investors just have to deal with if they want to own it.\n\nWhere's Bitcoin headed?\n\nIt's probably true that the next 10 years likely won't result in the same gains that Bitcoin registered in the past decade. If it did generate an annualized return of 74% between now and August 2033, Bitcoin's market cap would total a whopping $125 trillion, with the price of a single coin being greater than $6 million. While the strongest believers would be happy with this outcome, I think it's best to temper expectations.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Bitcoin makes for a poor investment today. I believe it can still beat the stock market over the long term. As I noted above, there's much greater institutional interest. With higher demand coming from huge amounts of capital, coupled with Bitcoin's fixed supply cap, the price is poised to rise. And I think that regulatory clarity will prove to be a positive factor because it will bring in investors who might've been hesitant to own Bitcoin.\n\nThe most realistic outcome I see playing out is that Bitcoin simply becomes a more popular store of value among not only individual and institutional investors, but also corporations and even governments. My confidence stems from the fact that in its entire existence, Bitcoin has never been hacked, not to mention that it's weathered multiple price drawdowns only to come roaring back. As a result, I don't see it going away anytime soon. In fact, I'd be surprised if its value isn't much higher 10 years from now."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether stable after last week\u2019s nosedive; XRP leads crypto gains; U.S. stock futures mixed - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia to trade slightly above the US$26,000 support level, after sliding over 10% for the week. Ether also moved higher but remained below US$1,700 following last week\u2019s losses. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP led the winners, despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moving to challenge a June court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped as NFT marketplace OpenSea said it will stop enforcing creator royalties from August 31. U.S. stock futures traded flat after Wall Street logged weekly losses at close of trading Friday.\n\nBaby steps upward for cryptos after painful few days\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.28% in the last 24 hours to US$26,178.36 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, logging a weekly loss of 10.68%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency hit a two-month low of US$25,409.11 on Friday, but held position above the US$26,000 support level over the weekend.\n\nA cool-off of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype in the U.S. could be behind the retreat of the token. That\u2019s the view of James Butterfill, head of research at European alternative asset manager CoinShares.\n\n\u201cThe surge in June, spurred by BlackRock\u2019s application for SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF, led to a noticeable spike in prices,\u201d said Butterfill in a report released Friday.\n\n\u201cHowever, markets are now coming to terms with the realization that an immediate SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is unlikely. It\u2019s noteworthy that current Bitcoin prices have stabilized around levels observed before this announcement,\u201d he added.\n\nThe low volume and volatility in Bitcoin, a rise in U.S. treasury yields, as well as concerns over China\u2019s ailing economy contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s sharp weekly decline, the CoinShares report found.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for the markets in the forthcoming months presents a blend of opportunities and challenges. It\u2019s anticipated that the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking rates further in September,\u201d Butterfill said.\n\nA dovish shift in Fed policy could provide a boost to Bitcoin\u2019s prospects, he added.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, investors are eagerly awaiting the SEC\u2019s verdict on the Grayscale ETF and BlackRock applications in September. Anticipations are that decisions on both applications might be postponed, potentially leading to investor disappointment,\u201d Butterfly said.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether moved up 0.85% to US$1,683.57 but remained 8.50% lower for the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. SEC could approve several ETFs based on Ethereum futures by October 2023, Bloomberg reported on Friday citing unnamed sources. Investment firms Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares have all applied for Ethereum ETF licenses.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, but all posted weekly losses. Cryptocurrencies have seen a total liquidation of US$24.91 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nThat\u2019s a considerable decrease on the daily losses posted last week during a calamitous downturn in the crypto market. On Friday alone, traders liquidated over US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies, including US$851.94 million in long positions \u2014 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise. On Monday, long position liquidations stood at US$6.89 million for the past 24 hours, according to data from crypto information platform CoinGlass.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the winners, gaining 3.96% to US$0.5408 but plunged 13.76% for the week.\n\nIn the on-going legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres on Thursday granted the SEC permission to appeal an earlier judgement in favor of Ripple Labs. That ruling in late June found that the technology firm\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws.\n\nIn a Saturday tweet, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said the SEC should not be allowed to appeal until the conclusion of the case. He said that, even if an appeal is granted, \u201cthe case should still continue and the appeal should run in parallel.\u201d\n\nYes. A party that loses on any claim or issue in their suit is entitled to appeal any adverse rulings at the conclusion of the suit. The SEC is asking for permission to appeal here because the suit is not complete yet for any party.\n\n\n\nYou can see why there would be a rule like\u2026 \u2014 David \"JoelKatz\" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 18, 2023\n\nRipple will have until September 1 to respond to the SEC\u2019s appeal motion.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.45% in the past 24 hours to US$1.06 trillion, while trading volume fell 13.09% to US$21.67 billion.\n\nOpenSea NFT marketplace to stop enforcing creator royalties\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.08% in the past 24 hours to 2,327.91 as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, and fell 5.94% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the index for Solana moved higher.\n\n\u201cThe catalyst for this (NFT index drop) was OpenSea\u2019s decision to get rid of royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, in a YouTube video uploaded Sunday.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced on Thursday it would stop enforcing creator royalty fees, making them optional. The change will take effect from August 31. The platform will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\n\u201c(The mandatory royalty fee on OpenSea) was meant to empower creators with greater control over their Web3 business models, but it required the buy-in of everyone in the Web3 ecosystem, and unfortunately that has not happened,\u201d wrote OpenSea in the announcement.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s move received criticism from commentators. In a tweet Friday, Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and an investor in OpenSea, described the decision as a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that would hurt the industry.\n\nNot collecting and paying royalties on NFT sales is a HUGE mistake by @opensea. It diminished trust in the platform and hurts the industry. And I say this as an @opensea investor @DevinFinzer \u2014 Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 18, 2023\n\nYuga Labs, the creator of NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), responded to the news in a tweet Saturday saying it will gradually wind down its support for OpenSea. \u201cYuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work,\u201d the company said.\n\nOn @opensea's decision to sunset their Operator Filter. pic.twitter.com/ahc155WWkX \u2014 Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) August 18, 2023\n\n\u201cWhat I think will happen is they either reverse their decision, or Yuga Labs may end up launching their own NFT marketplace,\u201d said Forkast Labs\u2019 Petscher on Sunday. While the impact of the decision is only just being felt, he added, it will \u201cchange the landscape of NFTs.\u201d\n\nTotal NFT trading volume gained 15.60% in the past 24 hours to US$14.76 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana and Polygon blockchains all logged increases, while Cardano\u2019s volume dipped.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based BAYC saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, which rose 45.30% to US$2.02 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Polygon-based DraftKings ranked as the second and third largest collections by 24-hour trading volume.\n\nIn terms of single NFT sales, BAYC #8585 sold at over US$255,000 on Sunday, making it the most expensive NFT traded in the past 24 hours. However, its former holder purchased the NFT at over US$1 million in October 2022.\n\n\u201cThis seller took a huge loss on this NFT,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThat explains the rising average sale price but also the declining profits.\u201d\n\nChina policy stimulus lacks punch\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed on Friday and booked losses for the week.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes traded mixed on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng logged losses, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved up.\n\nIn the U.S., investors await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed\u2019s annual summit is attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s thinking on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cWe view the event as a good opportunity for Powell to start laying the ground for the next step in the Fed\u2019s policy guidance: no longer focused on how many hikes to expect, but rather on rates remaining \u2018higher for longer,'\u201d analysts at Canadian investment bank TD Securities said in a note viewed by Reuters.\n\nIn July, the Fed raised the interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% \u2014 the highest level since January 2001. Powell said in a statement following the decision that the U.S. central bank will \u201ctake a data-dependent approach\u201d in determining its future monetary policies. It did not indicate if there are more hikes in the cards or how long the Fed would keep up its tightening cycle.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 11.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.\n\nU.S. data to watch in the week ahead includes U.S. chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s second-quarter earnings report, as well as S&P Global\u2019s purchasing manager indexes (PMI). Both are set for release Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s central bank cut its one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.45% from 3.55% on Monday morning. However, it kept the five-year LPR unchanged at 4.2%, according to the state media Xinhua News Agency.\n\nThe stimulus measure was smaller than the analyst expectation of two 15-basis-point cuts to both the one-year and five-year rates. Commentators said China\u2019s central bank may need to act more decisively to soothe growing fears of a recession.\n\n\u201cUntil more forceful policy responses are made available to backstop the contagion risk, we believe Chinese stocks will settle in a lower trading range than we previously envisaged,\u201d Goldman equity strategists wrote in a note viewed by Bloomberg.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "title": "Bitcoin mines could be used for energy storage | FT Tech - Financial Times",
        "content": "You can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player\n\nIt's shaken up the financial industry and inspired legions of devotees. But Bitcoin mining is extremely energy intensive, requiring powerful computers to run for days on end, solving complex mathematical problems in order to keep the Bitcoin system running. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have found the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is roughly equivalent to that of countries like Sweden, Norway, and Pakistan.\n\nAnd while Bitcoin bashers have labelled the digital currency a climate villain, one novel strategy being looked at is using crypto mining as a form of energy storage by converting stranded renewable energy into Bitcoin. Wind and solar energy can be unpredictable, with supply often exceeding immediate demand. As a result, grid-connected renewable energy sources often have to pause operations if they're producing too much energy, energy which can't be stored.\n\nOthers are not as convinced. Regulators in Sweden said even if Bitcoin could run on renewable energy, the country needs those energy sources for essential services. But Bitcoiners contend wind and solar farms are often located in remote locations, and electricity does not transmit efficiently over long distances. Bitcoin mines, however, can be located close to renewable projects.\n\nBitcoin mines could also tap into the wind, solar, and battery projects that are ready to produce energy but are still waiting to be connected to power grids. That's 1,300 gigawatts in the United States alone. Bitcoin is already being used to offset excess energy produced by several global fossil-fuel energy producers. US-based ConocoPhillips is selling stranded gas into Bitcoin miners in the Bakken, an oil-abundant region in the United States, while Exxon has agreed to redirect gas that would otherwise be wasted to mobile Bitcoin mines. TEPCO, Japan's biggest electric power company, is the first major player to send excess renewable energy into Bitcoin mining.\n\nCrypto miners also stand to benefit from arrangements like these, as pressure to lower their energy consumption grows. In 2022, New York State imposed a moratorium on fossil fuel-powered Bitcoin mines, and an ongoing regulatory crackdown on digital assets poses fresh challenges to the industry. Last year, President Biden also signed an executive order on digital assets and said the United States must take strong steps to reduce the risks they create when it comes to climate change and pollution. Another reason why major crypto miners are keen to find greener energy sources for their operations and lower their carbon footprint."

        "content": "A Chinese government official has been sentenced to life in prison for illegitimate business operations related to running a 2.4 billion Chinese yuan ($329 million) Bitcoin (BTC) mining enterprise and for unrelated charges of corruption.\n\nAccording to local media reports, the Intermediate People\u2019s Court of Hangzhou City sentenced Xiao Yi, a former member of the Jiangxi Provincial Political Consultative Conference Party Group and vice chairman, to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power on Aug. 22.\n\nThe corruption charges stem from non-crypto-related activities of bribery from 2008 to 2021. The abuse of power charges, dating from 2017 to 2021, stem from providing financial and electricity subsidies to Jiumu Group Genesis Technology, a firm based in the city of Fuzhou that at one point operated more than 160,000 Bitcoin mining machines.\n\nProsecutors say that Yi \u201ccovered up\u201d the mining operation by instructing relevant departments to fabricate statistical reports and adjust the classification of electricity consumption. From 2017 to 2020, Jiumu\u2019s electricity consumption accounted for 10% of Fuzhou\u2019s total electricity consumption. \u201cYi pleaded guilty and repented, actively returned the stolen funds, and all the bribes and their profits have been seized,\u201d wrote the ruling magistrate of the Hangzhou People\u2019s Court.\n\nCurrently, China bans all forms of cryptocurrency transactions, exchange operations and fiat-to-crypto onboarding but has stopped short of prohibiting outright ownership. In an Aug. 3 decision, a Chinese court ruled that a $10 million Bitcoin lending contract was invalid based on the country\u2019s Bitcoin ban with no possibility of legal debt recovery. On Aug. 14, a Chinese national was sentenced to nine months in prison for helping an acquaintance purchase Tether (USDT), profiting $20 from the transaction.\n\nFormer Chinese government official Xiao Yi awaits sentencing.

        "title": "If You Invested $100 in Bitcoin 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There could be some overlap between the properties of cryptocurrency and stocks, but certain differences are stark and persistent. Among them is volatility, as even Bitcoin (BTC -0.43%), the cryptocurrency with the biggest market cap, is prone to sharp and sudden drawdowns.\n\nCryptocurrency is supposed to be the people's money, and I'd hate to see anyone take an unnecessary loss from trading Bitcoin. So, if you're reeling from recent events in the crypto-sphere, I offer you a quick dose of perspective on the power of doing absolutely nothing. For example, a $100 Bitcoin investment five years ago would be worth $370 today.\n\nBitcoin's brutal battery\n\nAfter resting comfortably at $29,000 for a solid month, Bitcoin took a breathtaking drop to $26,000 the other day. That's a 10% cliff dive in just a few days. But unlike investors in the realm of stocks, Bitcoin traders can't cite an earnings report or a disappointing product launch as a cause for the drop.\n\nAsking why it happened is a natural response, but it might only lead to frustration in this instance. The general consensus seems to be that the Bitcoin sell-off was prompted by the one-two punch of hawkish-sounding statements from a Federal Reserve Board meeting (\"... most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy.\") followed by a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's SpaceX had sold its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe financial press needs something to talk about during a slow, low-volume summer for stocks, and the Bitcoin rout provided ample fodder for commentators.\n\nStay small, and just HODL\n\nSo, all of a sudden, folks are worried about SpaceX's crypto holdings (or lack thereof). In their panic, they apparently forgot that financial behemoth BlackRock is working on getting approval for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nNow, that's newsworthy. BlackRock's clout is considerable, its pockets are incredibly deep, and a spot Bitcoin ETF would truly be a game changer. BlackRock's crypto involvement matters much more than SpaceX's trades. It may even, perhaps, be more essential than the Fed's economic outlook, which can change from one meeting to the next.\n\nIf these considerations aren't helping you sleep at night, feel free to take a glance at Bitcoin's history of drawdowns. If you're going to HODL (hold on for dear life) with calm and confidence, you'll need to make volatility your friend (or at least a roommate you can live with).\n\nAfter all, Bitcoin has had multiple drawdowns of 30% or more. I can't make any guarantees about the most recent pullback from around $69,000, but previous crashes invariably resolved with new Bitcoin bull markets.\n\nIn addition to learning one's history, it certainly helps to maintain small positions with cryptocurrency. Thus, a mere $100 stake in Bitcoin five years ago, when it was trading at around $7,000, would have resulted in an immediate 50% crash as the digital coin fell to $3,500 in early 2019. But then, turning a $100 investment into $50 shouldn't be too painful for most investors.\n\nFast-forward to the present, and with Bitcoin's price gyrating wildly but landing near $26,000 from the starting point of $7,000, that $100 investment would now be worth approximately $370. That's an impressive return on one's capital, just for having sat on one's hands for half a decade. It's true that you could have cashed in your Bitcoin position for $980 at the very peak in October 2021, but that's an unrealistic target and almost everyone missed it. Patient ownership over the long term beats quick-draw day trading almost every time.\n\nUltimately, the events concerning SpaceX, the Fed, and even BlackRock shouldn't be of life-changing consequence to investors who are willing to stay small and extend their time frame.\n\nAnd just remember that a dose of perspective is an effective sleep aid for headline-harried HODLers when Bitcoin bends and buckles."

        "title": "Bitcoin spot ETF: What are the odds of approval? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Questions are swirling about whether or not the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin ETF (BTC-USD). Yahoo Finance Crypto Reporter David Hollerith explains that eight companies have filed for approval since BlackRock (BLK) did so back in June. Hollerith explains the situation, stating \"The SEC has several opportunities from here to either approve, deny or push off approval for these applications.\" Hollerith notes that many argue that Bitcoin is \"not regulated enough and too manipulatable\" as reasons for pushback against the potential spot ETF.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, a lot of speculation has surrounded the chances of a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved, given how much scrutiny the sector is feeling from regulators. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith to discuss this more. David, we know that-- we've been hearing a lot about the potential for this, but not seeing any companies quite make it to the finish line just yet.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Hey, Rachelle. Since BlackRock's filing, which happened earlier this summer, there's been eight other companies who've refiled applications to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, and that's included ARK Invest, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Invesco.\n\nAnd now, the SEC has several opportunities from here to either approve, deny, or simply push off approval for these applications. They can't push off approval after six months from now. That's when we'll have a definite decision about whether or not the agency would be OK with listing these products.\n\nBut that being said, earlier this month, ARK Invest application was pushed off approval, and the deadline for these other applications from the other asset managers are coming at the beginning of September. And John Reed Stark, who is a former attorney for the SEC's enforcement division, weighed in on this at the beginning of-- or excuse me, the end of last week. And he had said, he puts the chances at slim to none.\n\nStory continues\n\nStark, obviously having worked for the agency, does know a lot about the enforcement division, and his thoughts are that the Bitcoin spot market is too-- it's a little bit too not regulated enough and a little bit too manipulable, which has been the argument in past years for a why there's been no approval.\n\nBut a lot of people have really come out around the BlackRock filing. And Bloomberg's ETF team-- Bloomberg Intelligence's ETF team, which has been more bullish on the prospects of approval in the coming six months has said, the question is really what could BlackRock know that these other filers didn't know at the time?\n\nThey added a surveillance sharing agreement, which has been taken as a new addition to this. And potentially, people have said that might be what will make the change for the SEC to approve it. But at this point, it is still pretty unclear about how things could go. We're looking at the Grayscale lawsuit with the SEC, which we're expecting a verdict on any week now. And that's expected usually on a Tuesday or a Friday is when these verdicts come out.\n\nAnd obviously, Grayscale is trying to convert their GBTC product into an ETF. And that's been a long battle. So we could see some more clarity into the SEC's thinking with that verdict or at least with what they have to do next, depending on the judge's interpretations. But we're not expecting it to be a clear path for ETFs either, given that the verdict could mean a few different things.\n\nBut that being said, Bloomberg's team, which again, I said, has been a little bit more bullish, has said the odds of a Bitcoin spot ETF, they've placed it at around 65% at this point. So that's much better than it was before BlackRock filed for the product.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, you figure if BlackRock can't make it, what chance does some of these smaller companies have indeed? But thank you for getting us up to speed. And we will be taking a look at those enforcement actions as well. Our very own David Hollerith. Thanks so much."

        "content": "Cash App, a multipurpose financial app, offers various capabilities, including money transfers, investment options and cryptocurrency purchases. Serving as a comprehensive financial tool, Cash App provides users the capacity to handle transactions, invest in stocks, and explore digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The app aims to streamline financial tasks and assist users in navigating the modern financial landscape.\n\nWhat is Cash App?\n\nCash App, created by Block Inc (formerly Square Inc), is a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment service offering stored value services resembling deposit accounts. This innovative platform empowers users to access financial services without incurring the standard fees that accompany traditional banks.\n\nAs a non-banking financial solution, Cash App enables individuals to transfer and receive money, pay bills, file taxes and invest in stocks, complemented by the convenience of debit cards. With a sizable user base of 51 million individuals, Cash App offers an alternative to buying and selling Bitcoin on crypto exchanges.\n\nThe app\u2019s expansion began in 2018, opening the doors to cryptocurrency transactions limited solely to Bitcoin and cementing its place as one of the prominent mobile payment apps available in the United Kingdom and the United States. Starting from 2023, Cash App users can conveniently monitor their Bitcoin transactions to streamline tax reporting using the TaxBit integration, simplifying the process of calculating taxes for BTC holdings.\n\nBuy Bitcoin with Cash App\n\nBefore initiating the process of purchasing Bitcoin through Cash App, several preliminary steps are essential to ensure a smooth experience. Firstly, install the Cash App and create an account. Then, link the Cash App account to a checking or bank account. Once this link is established, Bitcoin purchases can be made. Additional security verification may be needed to enable investment features of Cash App, including buying Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to be aware that Cash App only enables Bitcoin transactions, and its investing balances are not Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)- and Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)-insured. However, there is limited Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) coverage of fiat investing balances. As you embark on the journey to buy Bitcoin on Cash App, remember these fundamental prerequisites for a hassle-free transaction process.\n\nSteps to buy Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nLaunch Cash App and log in to your account.\n\nEnsure that your Cash App account has sufficient funds. You can add money to your account using your linked debit or credit card or receiving direct deposits.\n\nTap on the \u201cInvesting\u201d section located at the bottom of the screen.\n\nLook for the \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d option and tap it to proceed.\n\nEnter the amount of Bitcoin you wish to purchase or use the slider to select a specific amount.\n\nEnter your PIN and review the transaction details, including the current BTC price and any applicable fees.\n\nTap the \u201cBuy\u201d button to confirm your instant Bitcoin purchase.\n\nAuto Invest Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nThe Auto Invest feature can be utilized on Cash App to schedule recurring Bitcoin purchases that correspond to one\u2019s preferences. By streamlining the accumulation of BTC over time, this function eliminates the necessity for manual transactions. This feature allows users to allocate a portion of their paycheck to Bitcoin consistently and spread out Bitcoin purchases to mitigate price fluctuations.\n\nSteps to set up Auto Invest on Cash App:\n\nAccess the \u201cBitcoin Investing\u201d screen and tap \u201cBuy.\u201d\n\nClick the drop-down menu labeled \u201cChange Order Type.\u201d\n\nChoose a frequency \u2014 daily, weekly or every two weeks \u2014 and tap \u201cDone.\u201d\n\nOpt for a preset amount or customize by tapping \u201c...\u201d and entering your desired amount.\n\nPress \u201cNext,\u201d keeping in mind that there\u2019s a $10 minimum for Auto Invest purchases.\n\nConfirm your selection to set up automatic investments.\n\nCash App fees for purchasing Bitcoin\n\nCash App may impose fees for Bitcoin transactions depending on transaction size, and the current mid-market price of Bitcoin will apply to the purchase. The app also includes a spread, resulting in paying slightly more than the market value for the Bitcoin or selling slightly below market value.\n\nThe margin may differ when purchasing Bitcoin using Cash App compared to selling it. The margin and prices can also vary from what is advertised on other marketplaces.\n\nDuring transactions with Bitcoin, Cash App will impose two types of fees: One of them is the service fee, and the other is an extra fee based on the price volatility across exchanges in the United States. The fees will appear on the confirmation of the trade before completing the transaction. In this way, if there is a disagreement with the final price, the option not to proceed is available.\n\nWho can buy Bitcoin with Cash App?\n\nTo buy Bitcoin on Cash App, users must fulfill specific requirements. To use the application, a person needs to be at least 18 years old and over the age of maturity in their residence state. Additionally, they must be individuals, not businesses or other entities, and use the service for personal use only. Cash App is available in the U.K. and the U.S., and all 50 U.S. states can access the platform to purchase Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, complete anonymity might not always be attainable. Certain government-issued or digital currency transfers may request users to provide personal information, such as their name, phone number, address, taxpayer identification number, birth date, email, government identification number and bank account details. Additionally, users may also be asked to disclose their money source and employment information.\n\nGet Bitcoin with Cash app via Bitcoin Boost\n\nAnother way to get Bitcoin on Cash App is to earn it. The Bitcoin Boost function enables you to accumulate Bitcoin with each Cash Card transaction. Upon selecting a Bitcoin Boost and purchasing a Cash Card, the earned Bitcoin is automatically added to your Bitcoin balance.\n\nSteps to implement a Cash app Bitcoin Boost\n\nAccess the \u201cCash Card\u201d tab on your home screen.\n\nTap \u201cSave with Boost,\u201d choose a Boost and then click to add Boost.\n\nCash App does not charge any fees on Bitcoin Boost. For transaction-specific Bitcoin earnings, refer to your \u201cActivity\u201d tab and tap the relevant Cash Card transaction.\n\nSecurity and safety measures offered by Cash app\n\nCash App complies with PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Level 1, the highest security compliance standard for merchants that accept payments. As a user, this implies that your data is secured and encrypted.\n\nWhile Cash App provides a convenient way to buy Bitcoin, it\u2019s essential to prioritize security. Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) and using a robust and unique password for your account to protect your Bitcoin wallet and transactions.\n\nBy enabling 2FA, requiring a PIN to transfer cash and activating alerts for account activity, you may increase the security of your Cash App account. If your card is lost or stolen, it\u2019s possible to deactivate it to prevent fraudulent charges. Also, avoid sharing sensitive information with anyone and be cautious of potential scams related to cryptocurrency purchases.\n\nDrawbacks to buying Bitcoin via Cash App\n\nWhile Cash App provides an alternative platform to buying Bitcoin, there are some drawbacks to consider. Firstly, if you are an investor interested in diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond Bitcoin, Cash App falls short, as it only offers the option to buy Bitcoin and does not support other cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional brokers, Cash App\u2019s investment options are limited, restricting your ability to explore various digital assets.\n\nMoreover, it is essential to note that, unlike traditional banks, Cash App\u2019s Bitcoin and investing balances are not insured by the FDIC or FSCS. This means that your funds held within the app are not protected in the same way as they would be in a bank account. However, investing balances may be covered by SIPC in some cases. Also, in the U.S., Cash Card offers your account benefits from FDIC coverage, ensuring security for up to $250,000 of your Cash App account balance.\n\nTherefore, exploring dedicated crypto exchanges may be more suitable for investors seeking a more comprehensive range of investment options and the security of FDIC insurance."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. BNB, the native token of Binance, has been trading near its yearly low since reports emerged last week about the termination of the partnership between the cryptocurrency exchange and its U.K. payments partner.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin falls below US$26,000 following Evergrande\u2019s bankruptcy\n\nBitcoin and Ether fall along with all top 10 cryptos\n\nBitcoin traded at US$26,088 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after falling to a two-month low of US$25,409 last Friday.\n\nEther inched down 0.11% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,665 and was down 9.57% during the past week.\n\nAccording to Phillip Lord, president of the crypto payment app Oobit, the crypto market needs more clarity on Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications to start gaining momentum.\n\nThe SEC delayed a decision on approving the spot Bitcoin ETF application of Ark Investment Management on Aug. 11, following a 21-day public consultation, a week before the agency announced that it will delay its decision on the pending Bitcoin ETF applications to 2024. The agency has accepted a total of six spot Bitcoin ETFs for review.\n\n\u201cThe upward momentum will be reinvigorated once the fog of the [Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s] saga will be dispersed,\u201d wrote Lord.\n\nBNB fell 2.17% over the past 24 hours to US$208 on Tuesday, close to its yearly low of US$207 registered on Monday.\n\nBinance has reportedly placed euro withdrawal limits in Europe on Sunday, due to mounting issues with its payments partners. Binance announced in June that it will change its euro banking partner, Paysafe Payment Solutions, from Sept. 25. On Aug. 17, London-based payment processor Checkout.com ended its partnership with the exchange due to concerns over money laundering and compliance. Binance contested these reasons, suggesting they might pursue legal recourse.\n\nBinance isn\u2019t the only exchange facing hurdles. CoinDCX from India announced layoffs of approximately 70 employees, about 12% of its workforce.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.17% to US$1.05 trillion while trading volume increased 22.14% to US$28.02 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nOpenSea\u2019s optional royalties sink Forkast 500 to new bottom\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.61% to 2,315.99 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and declined 6.77% during the week. The index hit a new all-time low of 2,313.63 points on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is finding new lows, but also new highs at the same time. The Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects a tremendous loss of value this year which has accelerated this week following OpenSea\u2019s announcement that they\u2019re moving away from forced royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced on Thursday it would stop enforcing creator royalty fees, making them optional. The change will take effect from August 31. The platform will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose for a second consecutive day, up 27.42% to US$10.26 million, boosted by the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), that rose 190% to US$3.46 million. Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales also rose 49.18% to US$648,285, but DeGods sales fell 17.35% to US$418,395 according to CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cA perfect example of losses sellers are realizing is Bored Ape #8585 which sold yesterday for US$255,000 at a US$750,000 loss. It last sold one year ago for 777 ETH or just over US$1 million,\u201d said Petscher, adding that we\u2019re in a period of NFTs shaking out.\n\nDraftKings, a Polygon-based NFT project, fell to become the fourth-largest collection across all chains after its 24-hour sales fell 56.21% to US$3.46 million. Polygon\u2019s 24-hour sales fell 45.50% to US$7.96 million, but the Forkast POL NFT Composite inched up 0.03%, as the only Forkast Labs index in the green for the day.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures rise, Hang Seng starts recovery\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities rose as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posting gains.\n\nThe Hang Seng climbed 0.94% on Tuesday, escaping its near nine-month low hit on Monday, mainly boosted by gains in the tech sector.\n\nThe annual inflation rate in Hong Kong edged lower to 1.8% in July, from 1.9% in the previous months, beating market expectations of 2%. The falling inflation failed to lift investor sentiment.\n\nMajor U.S. stock futures also rose on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all increasing. The Nasdaq was boosted by an 8.47% surge in Nvidia share prices that rose to US$469, after HSBC raised its price target to US$780, ahead of the chip maker\u2019s earnings report tomorrow.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are anticipating Tuesday\u2019s earnings reports from BHP Group, Lowe\u2019s Companies, Medtronic and Baidu.\n\nInvestors are also looking ahead to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remarks at the central bank\u2019s annual symposium on Friday, for signs of the Fed\u2019s future monetary decisions.\n\nSee related article: Singapore\u2019s Stablecoin framework, Australia\u2019s crypto landscape & Binance shuts \u2018Connect\u2019"

        "content": "Jacobi Asset Management\u2019s decision to launch a spot bitcoin ETF on Euronext Amsterdam this week has proved to be a stroke of marketing genius amid the ongoing heated debate in the US.\n\nThe Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF (BCOIN) is listed on Euronext Amsterdam and regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC), which changed its rules to approve the structure in October 2021.\n\nIt is important to note that only professional investors in the UK and Netherlands with over $100,000 can access the bitcoin ETF, which is an alternative investment fund (AIF), and it will not enjoy the same distribution rules as other UCITS ETFs or exchange-traded products (ETPs).\n\n\u201cGuernsey is offshore so not as tightly regulated as the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) or Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) but it has a strong history in financial services,\u201d Shane Coveney, partner at Dillon Eustace, told ETF Stream.\n\n\u201cIt is not a UCITS product but an AIF so professional investors will get direct exposure to spot bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHowever, this has not halted the deluge of media coverage over the past few days highlighting how Europe beat the US in launching the first spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nLast week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) again delayed its decision to approve or reject a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s move to file for a spot bitcoin ETF in June led many industry commentators to predict the US regulator would greenlight the structure, however, investors must continue to wait.\n\nUS investors can only currently invest in bitcoin futures ETFs while European investors, in contrast, have been able to access spot bitcoin via exchange-traded notes (ETNs) since 2018.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to see Europe moving ahead of the US in opening up bitcoin investing for institutional investors who want access to the benefits of digital assets,\u201d Martin Bednall, CEO of Jacobi Asset Management, said.\n\n\u201cUnlike other products in the European market which are debt instruments, our fund owns the underlying assets directly.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of the launch last year sparked a war of words between many crypto ETP issuers in Europe who warned the structure was created solely in order to gain a \u201cPR advantage\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is all a marketing ploy which plays off of the whole US saga,\u201d Townsend Lansing, head of product at CoinShares, told ETF Stream. \u201cThe Jacobi product is an AIF and therefore not available for general public distribution.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason why issuers do not select this product structure \u2013 whether for crypto or other ineligible assets such as gold. It does not offer any meaningful benefits, has limited chance of proper liquidity and is very difficult to distribute.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bednall said the AIF structure is a \u201cbetter product with greater investor protection\u201d.\n\n\u201cInvestors are free to choose between the different product structures, but, all else being equal, I know the majority would always choose a fund over a note,\u201d he added.\n\nJacobi AM\u2019s launch has certainly created a lot of media hype but time will tell whether its ETF will be a success. As always, investors will vote with their assets."

        "title": "Global Central Banks' Take on Bitcoin: Mixed Signals Abound - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "In the middle of the continuing fintech revolution, Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, has caught the global financial community's fascination as well as anxiety. As the digital currency's popularity grows, central banks throughout the world are struggling with its ramifications, generating a variety of responses that reflect a landscape of contradictory signals.\n\nThe Bitcoin Evolution\n\nBitcoin has evolved from a fringe digital curiosity to a mainstream asset that occupies the attention of governments, organizations, and individual investors since its birth in 2009. Because of its decentralized structure, borderless transactions, and ability to disrupt traditional banking, Bitcoin is both a revolutionary technology and a source of worry.\n\nA Global Overview of Diverse Approaches\n\nCentral banks all across the world are looking at Bitcoin with a mix of interest, skepticism, and regulatory anxiety. These techniques represent the tangled web of technology, finance, and the regulatory structures that govern them.\n\nPositive Attitude: Possibilities and Innovation\n\nSome central banks see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as symbols of technical development and creativity. They recognize the potential benefits of blockchain technology, which serves as the underlying infrastructure for cryptocurrencies, in improving financial efficiency and security. These financial institutions are investigating how blockchain might be used to speed payment systems, cut transaction costs, and increase transparency.\n\nPragmatic Regulation: Balancing Risk and Innovation\n\nOther central banks have taken a more cautious approach, focusing on regulatory frameworks that balance innovation and risk management. They recognize the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies while highlighting the importance of protecting consumers, ensuring market integrity, and preventing illegal activity such as money laundering and fraud. This strategy aims to capitalize on the beneficial characteristics of cryptocurrencies while limiting any negative implications.\n\nConcerns and Skepticism: Volatility and Stability\n\nCentral banks are concerned about Bitcoin's extraordinary price volatility. Bitcoin's volatile pricing makes it difficult to utilize it as a steady medium of exchange or a reliable store of wealth. This volatility can pose investment risks and impede its acceptance as a mainstream currency.\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\n\nCentral banks are responsible for monetary policy and financial stability. Because of its decentralized design and limited supply, Bitcoin is impervious to standard monetary policy tools such as interest rate changes. This independence raises concerns about how central banks will govern their economies if Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies become popular.\n\nRegulatory Difficulties: A Global Patchwork\n\nThe global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is anything but uniform. Central banks are navigating a wide range of legal and regulatory environments, from those that encourage cryptocurrency use to those that explicitly prohibit it. This hodgepodge of legislation makes cross-border commerce, international cooperation, and regulatory harmonization difficult.\n\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital currencies issued by central banks.\n\nCentral banks are also investigating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which are digital representations of a country's national currency. The goal of CBDCs is to combine the efficiency of digital transactions with the stability and regulatory oversight provided by central banks. CBDCs, while not the same as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, have the potential to revolutionize the digital payments ecosystem.\n\nChina's Leadership in CBDCs\n\nChina has assumed a leading role in the CBDC space, piloting the digital yuan in multiple places. The digital yuan, also known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), is a government-backed program aiming at increasing financial inclusion, lowering transaction costs, and consolidating the central bank's control over the monetary system.\n\nChina is \u201cleading the way\u201d when it comes to CBDCs, says Crypto Council for Innovation's Yaya Fanusie.\n\n\n\nHe speaks with @kaileyleinz on \u201cBloomberg Crypto\u201d https://t.co/ipX3d51wnU pic.twitter.com/Yqc5N0HoOp \u2014 Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) February 28, 2023\n\nThe Broader Consequences\n\nThe central banks' position on Bitcoin extends beyond the digital currency itself, touching on basic issues like as the future of money, financial stability, and the function of central banks in the digital era.\n\nThe Clash of Titans: Are CBDCs and BTC on a Collision Course?\n\nThe emergence of CBDCs is poised to reshape the landscape of digital finance, setting the stage for a potential showdown with the reigning titan of the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nCBDCs carry the weight of government backing and regulatory frameworks. Their introduction promises increased financial inclusion, streamlined transactions, and enhanced transparency. As governments worldwide explore CBDC implementation, they hold the potential to establish a more controlled and regulated digital currency ecosystem.\n\nOn the opposing side stands Bitcoin, the pioneer and poster child of decentralized cryptocurrencies. With its fixed supply, borderless nature, and independence from traditional financial systems, Bitcoin has earned the loyalty of a dedicated global community. Its unique attributes have positioned it as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a hedge against traditional market volatility.\n\nThe impending clash between CBDCs and BTC revolves around centralization versus decentralization. CBDCs operate within existing financial frameworks, offering governments greater control over monetary policies and transactions. In contrast, Bitcoin's decentralized nature promotes financial autonomy and privacy, but also poses regulatory challenges.\n\nThe outcome of this clash remains uncertain. CBDCs possess the advantages of legitimacy and government backing, likely appealing to mainstream users and institutional investors. However, BTC's core value proposition lies in its independence from centralized control, making it a beacon for those who value financial sovereignty.\n\nAs both CBDCs and BTC continue to evolve, they could coexist as parallel options in the digital finance arena, catering to distinct preferences. Yet, the competition for dominance could intensify as governments seek to exert control over the digital financial landscape while Bitcoin loyalists advocate for decentralized freedoms.\n\nThe battle between CBDCs and BTC epitomizes the broader tension between centralized authority and decentralized innovation. Whether they converge, collaborate, or collide, their interaction will significantly influence the future of money, finance, and the very concept of value in our increasingly digital world.\n\nThe Transformation of Financial Landscapes\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin has compelled central banks to reconsider their duties and how they engage with traditional financial systems. The potential for digital currencies to transform payment systems, cross-border transactions, and government-citizen relationships is leading central banks to rethink how they can adapt and innovate.\n\nStandardization and global cooperation\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies are decentralized, global cooperation and regulatory standardization have become more difficult. Collaboration is essential for establishing standard policies that protect consumers, prohibit illegal activity, and facilitate cross-border trade. To ensure a peaceful and efficient global financial ecosystem, central banks must negotiate this problem.\n\nConclusion: An Exciting Journey Ahead\n\nThe worldwide central banking community's reaction to Bitcoin is varied, reflecting the many factors that go into welcoming innovation while maintaining stability. Central banks will continue to evolve their posture as the world grapples with the ramifications of digital currencies and blockchain technology, reacting to the dynamic interplay of technological breakthroughs, regulatory imperatives, and the ever-changing financial landscape.\n\nThe road ahead is fraught with uncertainty, but it also has the promise of reshaping finance for the better, ushering in a new era of digital innovation and financial inclusivity."

Analysts say disappointment from the stalemate on U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications has impacted sentiment. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index continued its downward slide in the wake of NFT marketplace OpenSea\u2019s decision to stop enforcing creator royalties. U.S. stock futures traded lower after Wall Street closed mixed on Monday.\n\nETF logjam and low liquidity damaging sentiment\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.10% in the last 24 hours to US$26,133.35 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, expanding its weekly loss of 11.12%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency dropped to a low of US$25,846.09 just after midnight, but rallied to reclaim US$26,000 as the night progressed.\n\n\u201cAs the beginning of the week turned positive for traditional markets, crypto markets seem to \u2014 for now \u2014 be back in stagnation mode,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cMany investors were understandably spooked by last week\u2019s rapid rise in volatility and the subsequent price fall, which now means that a positive mood will only be just enough to keep crypto markets where they are.\u201d\n\nFor some analysts, last week\u2019s rapid decline in the price of Bitcoin is a correction for price increases since June caused by ETF hype in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe recent turmoil led BTC price to trading levels that mirror the ones preceding the Blackrock filing for their BTC Spot ETF,\u201d Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note.\n\n\u201cThe fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) which lasted a few weeks after the filing seems to be now disappeared, waiting for news on the matter,\u201d Greco added.\n\nStory continues\n\nLow liquidity in the crypto market also contributed to last week\u2019s slide. Limited trading volume is driving market makers \u2014 which typically absorb sudden fluctuations in supply and demand and help provide a more predictable trading environment \u2014 to wind down their activities and wait for a better time to fully resume operations.\n\nGSR Markets, described by Greco as \u201cone of the most important market makers,\u201d has recently gone through two rounds of layoffs in response to worsening market conditions. Greco pointed out that before GSR, influential market makers Jane Street and Jump took similar actions citing difficulties with the state of the market.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dropped 0.84% to US$1,667.73 and moved down 9.55% for the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower over the past 24 hours. Polygon\u2019s Matic token led the losers. It dropped 3.53% to US$0.5589 for a weekly loss of 17.81%.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an outflow of US$55 million in the week ending August 18. That followed a US$29 million inflow the previous week, according to a CoinShares report released Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is in reaction to recent media highlighting that a decision by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission in allowing a U.S. spot-based ETF is not imminent,\u201d the company wrote in the report.\n\nBitcoin-linked investment products saw the majority of last week\u2019s outflow, totaling US$42 million. Ethereum, Polygon, Litecoin and Polkadot also recorded outflows, while XRP-linked inflows totaled US$1.2 million.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.62% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume rose 35.31% to US$29.31 billion.\n\nNFT marketplace Recur to shut down\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.41% in the past 24 hours to 2,319.54 as of 10:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, falling 6.69% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum Solana and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the Polygon index moved higher.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects a tremendous loss of value this year which has accelerated this week following OpenSea\u2019s announcement that they\u2019re moving away from forced royalties,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nOpenSea, one of the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplaces, announced last week it will stop enforcing creator royalty fees from August 31, but will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.\n\n\u201cYuga Labs, Animoca, and even Mark Cuban came out with statements calling the move a mistake for the digital economy and creators. Sentiment may be at a low point this year now and as one might expect, prices are tumbling,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nThe average NFT sales price in the week ending August 20 dropped to US$26.26, the lowest since August 2020 and down over 78% from the start of the year, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cNow the flipside is that NFT transactions hit an all time high last week,\u201d said Petscher. Participation matters a lot to me, and seeing 3,702,180 transactions tells me NFTs have reached a new height.\u201d\n\nAmid rising transactions and sliding prices, sellers posted about US$9.5 million in losses last week, CryptoSlam data shows.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume edged up 0.49% in the past 24 hours to US$13.60 million. Volumes on the Ethereum, BNB Chain and Cardano blockchains logged increases, while the Solana, Polygon and Bitcoin volumes dropped.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. It rose 60.15% to over US$2.04 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Ethereum-based Mutant Ape Yacht Club ranked as the second and third largest collections by 24-hour trading volume.\n\nElsewhere, NFT marketplace Recur announced on Saturday it would gradually shut down by November 16.\n\nToday, with heavy hearts, we must share some difficult news.\n\n\n\nAfter much contemplation and consideration, we\u2019ve decided to deprecate the RECUR platform, effective November 16, 2023.\n\n\n\nLearn more: https://t.co/5NbiTQSAGo \u2014 RECUR (@RecurForever) August 18, 2023\n\nThe decision came less than two years after a US$50 million funding round investment raised the platform\u2019s valuation to US$333 million.\n\n\u201cUnforeseen challenges and shifts in the business landscape have made it increasingly difficult for us to continue providing the level of service and dedication that we have always strived to maintain,\u201d said Recur in a Twitter thread on Saturday.\n\nAll eyes on Nvidia\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading lower as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. indexes closed mixed at the end of regular session trading Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logging gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average booked losses.\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia were mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index dipped, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged gains.\n\nAI chipmaker Nvidia spearheaded a rally in the technology sector on Monday. The U.S. tech giant posted gains of 8.5% after HSBC raised its price target for the U.S. firm\u2019s stock to US$780, the second highest on Wall Street.\n\nNvidia \u2014 whose share price has surged three times higher since the start of the year on the back of booming interest in artificial intelligence \u2014 will release its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been covering tech since 1994 and I have never seen an environment where you are so dependent on one company to deliver,\u201d Inge Heydorn, partner at investment firm GP Bullhound, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cAI is really the last pillar of growth and everybody is depending on it. If Nvidia shows weakness, we could be in for quite a substantial correction in the market,\u201d Bullhound added.\n\nMeanwhile, investors await U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed-held annual summit will be attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell\u2019s speech could provide insights into the Fed\u2019s thinking on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThe Fed and investors will soon pivot from a focus on how high the policy rate will go to a concern about how long they will stay at that level \u2014 and what the implications are for a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 scenario,\u201d Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at financial services firm Northern Trust, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIn our view, Powell will want to stay on message, and will try to push back against a growing market consensus that rate cuts are on the 2024 horizon,\u201d said Nixon.\n\nThe U.S. interest rate currently sits between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 15.5% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, up from 11.5% on Monday.\n\nIn China, investors are assessing Beijing\u2019s latest round of policy stimulus. Analysts suspect Monday\u2019s smaller-than-expected interest rate cut by the central bank may not be enough to stop a slide toward recession.\n\n\u201cThe small injection of stimulus by China\u2019s central bank in the ailing economy has proved largely underwhelming given the scale of the challenges erupting across sectors, but it has given investors hope there could be more to come,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at U.K.-based financial service firm Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) holdings owned by speculators are nearly 90% in the red after the \u201cflash crash\u201d to $26,000, new research says.\n\nIn the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Week On-Chain,\u201d analytics firm Glassnode reveals the true cost of last week\u2019s BTC price dip to newcomers.\n\nShort-term holders \u201cincreasingly sensitive\u201d to BTC price\n\nWhile only totaling around 10%, the drop in BTC/USD seen toward the end of last week upended market sentiment.\n\nAs BTC price predictions focus on $25,000 and even lower, the dust is settling on a trading environment accustomed to months of sideways behavior.\n\nArguably, nowhere is this more visible than among short-term holders (STHs) \u2014 the more speculative end of the hodler spectrum.\n\nGlassnode defines an STH as an entity holding onto BTC for 155 days or less. Its counterpart is the long-term holder (LTH), more widely referred to as a classic \u201chodler.\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of the 2.56M BTC held by STHs, only 300k BTC (11.7%) is still in profit,\u201d the research states.\n\nBitcoin STH supply profit and loss chart (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, the overall share of the BTC supply in the hands of STHs is at multiyear lows. That said, the past week has dramatically reshaped profitability among the cohort, which previously functioned as a framework for the BTC trading range.\n\nThe STH aggregate breakeven point, known as realized price, currently sits above $28,500.\n\nBitcoin STH/LTH cost basis (realized price) chart.

        "title": "Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC): Overview and Examples in Crypto - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC)?\n\nA hashed timelock contract (HTLC) is a type of smart contract used in blockchain applications. It reduces counterparty risk by creating a time-based escrow that requires a cryptographic passphrase for unlocking.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that the person receiving the funds in a transaction has to perform two actions to access the funds: enter the correct passphrase and claim payment within a specific timeframe. If they enter an incorrect passphrase or do not claim the funds within the timeframe, they lose access to the payment.\n\nKey Takeaways A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) reduces counterparty risk in decentralized smart contracts by effectively creating a time-based escrow that utilizes a cryptographic passphrase.\n\nThis type of smart contract requires the receiver of a payment to acknowledge it within a certain period of time or forfeit it.\n\nPayments using HTLCs are conditional and so have efficiency benefits for blockchain transactions. This property makes HTLCs a fundamental tool used by the lightning network.\n\nUnderstanding Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs)\n\nA Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) uses several elements from existing cryptocurrency transactions. For example, HTLC transactions use multiple signatures consisting of a private and public key to verify and validate transactions. However, two elements distinguish HTLC from standard cryptocurrency transactions with smart contracts\u2014the hashlock and the time contract.\n\nHashlock\n\nThe first element is the hashlock. A hashlock is a hashed\u2014or cryptographically scrambled\u2014version of a public key generated by the person that initiated the transaction. The associated private key is then used to unlock the original hash.\n\nIn HTLC, the initiating party generates a key and hashes it. The hash is stored in a pre-image, which is revealed during the final transaction. HTLCs are programmed to expire after a certain period passes or a specific number of blocks are generated, creating a known termination date and time.\n\nTo conduct a transaction using HTLC, both parties need to open channels with each other. This is generally done using a wallet, an exchange, or both.\n\nTimelock\n\nThe second important element of HTLC is a timelock. Two different timelocks are used to set time constraints on contracts generated using HTLC. The first one is CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV). It uses a time base to lock and release cryptocurrency. This means that time constraints are hardcoded, and coins are released only at a specific time and date or a specific height of block size.\n\nAtomic swaps\u2014cross-chain trading between cryptocurrencies\u2014 are often achieved using HTLCs. Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s lightning network (LN) also employs HTLCs.\n\n\n\nThe second one is CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). It is not dependent on time; instead, it uses the number of blocks generated as a tracking measure to determine when to finalize a transaction.\n\nThe Process in a Hashed Timelock Contract\n\nSuppose Alice wants to exchange her Bitcoin for Litecoin from Bob. A typical HTLC transaction between them takes place as follows:\n\nAlice generates a hash from her Litecoin private key and sends it to Bob. She also generates a pre-image of the hash by creating a nominal transaction. This pre-image will help her validate and finalize the transaction. Bob also generates a hash from his key and sends it to Alice. In addition to this, he creates a pre-image by conducting a nominal transaction (in Litecoin). Once Alice receives Bob\u2019s Litecoin transaction, she signs it using the original key that is already available with her in the pre-image. Bob does likewise on his end, using his private key to unlock Alice\u2019s transaction. Once Alice and Bob enter their keys and agree to the transaction, the smart contract executes it. Neither can change the transaction once it executes, which removes the possibility that one could trick the other by quickly canceling the exchange.\n\nWhat Is a Timelock Contract? A timelock contract is a smart contract embedded in a blockchain that executes a transaction at a specific time. They are used in hashed timelock contracts and payment channels where specific payment times are needed.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Have Smart Contracts? Initially, Bitcoin's blockchain was not able to execute smart contracts. However, the Taproot upgrade in 2021 allowed the blockchain to use smart contracts in transactions.\n\nWhat Is a Smart Contract? A smart contract is a program stored on a blockchain that executes when specific conditions are met.\n\nHow Much Does a Smart Contract Cost? On the Ethereum blockchain, a smart contract deployment takes gas, which costs Gwei (a lower denomination of ether). Depending on the complexity of the contract, it can cost billions of Gwei to deploy a smart contract. Less complex contracts like a simple exchange are much cheaper.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "title": "Renewable energy Bitcoin mining company powers up in Sweden - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Sweden has welcomed a hydro-powered Bitcoin (BTC) mining data center.\n\nGenesis Digital Assets Limited (GDA), a mining and data center company with over 400 megawatts (MW) of power generation worldwide, has opened a new data center in Sweden, driven by the country\u2019s burgeoning renewable energy surplus.\n\nThe new operation is located in the far north of Sweden, where hydroelectric power dominates the grid. Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, founder and executive president of GDA, told Cointelegraph that the new data center is located near the Porjus Hydroelectric Power Station:\n\n\u201cGiven the proximity to the hydroelectric power station, we expect all of our electricity consumption to be powered by renewable energy.\u201d\n\nThe total capacity of the data center is approximately 8 MW and is expected to result in a hash rate of approximately 155 petahashes per second. GDA explained to Cointelegraph that there are 1,900 Bitcoin mining machines deployed in the Porjus data center.\n\nAs reported by Jaran Mellerud, a business developer at Luxor Mining and a frequent Cointelegraph contributor, Sweden produces almost all of its electricity from nuclear and hydropower, particularly in the north.\n\nMellerud, who hails from nearby Norway, explained that renewable energy is also abundant:\n\n\u201cSweden is an electricity powerhouse, generating the fifth-most electricity per capita globally in 2021.\u201d\n\nGDA\u2019s strategic expansion is part of a broader trend in the Northern European Bitcoin mining landscape. Christian Anders, founder of BT.CX \u2014 a Swedish Bitcoin exchange dating back to January 2012 \u2014 told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin mining is not very common due to high energy prices.\n\nHowever, the Nordics are a class apart, Anders told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cSweden, Finland and Norway have a surplus of energy and negative energy prices from time to time, and primarily renewable energy in the form of hydropower in a remote location which is hard to distribute.\u201d\n\nUntapped, stranded and renewable energy are popular ingredients for Bitcoin mining, as they tend to be the cheapest. Mirakhmedov explained, \u201cSweden also has abundant clean energy sources, which is an important factor we consider in our operations.\u201d\n\nPorjus is in the far north of Sweden where renewable energy is abundant.\n\nMoreover, while sentiment among some Scandinavians is negative toward Bitcoin, Anders told Cointelegraph that energy companies are coming around to Bitcoin mining\u2019s utility: \u201cThe CEO of the largest energy producer in Sweden, Vattenfall, is pro-Bitcoin mining and its use case for grid balancing.\u201d Stabilizing electricity grids with Bitcoin miners is also growing in the United States.\n\nTim Carra, head of Nordic at GDA, expanded on the point in correspondence with Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cWith abundant energy sources, a pro-innovation environment and a strong educational system that results in a great culture of innovation, we believe that Sweden is one of the best countries in the world to mine Bitcoin and expect to further invest in this beautiful region moving forward.\u201d\n\nGDA concentrates the majority of its power generation in Texas in the United States, where one facility consumes 300 MW of electricity. The new Swedish operations complement a new GDA facility in South Carolina and demonstrate that there are still some attractive, untapped potential mining destinations around the world. Anders chimed in:\n\n\u201cThere is also a market opportunity in Spain/Portugal, which gets cheap energy from Africa and its domestic solar production, where prices also are very cheap from time to time. BT.CX is working with renewable Bitcoin miners to offer a way to offset your Bitcoin holdings.\u201d\n\nAs Anders alludes to, the generation of new Bitcoin consumes considerable amounts of electricity. The European Central Bank has reported that Bitcoin mining has a significant carbon footprint.\n\nStats from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. Global energy consumption is estimated at 25,000 terawatt-hours, according to the IEA.\n\nHowever, while it\u2019s often portrayed as an energy-guzzling and carbon-intensive industry, Bitcoin mining consumes just 149.95 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, or less than 0.7% of global energy, according to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance.\n\nRelated: Tether invests in El Salvador\u2019s $1B renewable energy project\n\nMeanwhile, renewable energy, including hydro, continues to dominate the global Bitcoin mining energy mix. Neighboring Norway, for example, contributes roughly 1% of the Bitcoin hash rate and is 100% renewable, while the new GDA installation in Sweden is another green energy Bitcoin miner.\n\nUltimately, Anders concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s super cool that more miners are coming to the Nordic European countries to help us with this mission.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "title": "Bitcoin, ether stabilise after last week\u2019s nosedive from ETF cool-off - South China Morning Post",
        "content": "\u201cThe surge in June, spurred by BlackRock\u2019s application for SEC approval of a bitcoin ETF, led to a noticeable spike in prices,\u201d said Butterfill in a report released Friday.\n\nA cool-off of bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype in the US could be behind the retreat of the token. That is the view of James Butterfill, head of research at European alternative asset manager CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.3 per cent in the last 24 hours to US$26,178 as of 07:30am in Hong Kong, logging a weekly loss of 10.7 per cent, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency hit a two-month low of US$25,409 on Friday, but held position above the US$26,000 support level over the weekend.\n\n\u201cHowever, markets are now coming to terms with the realisation that an immediate SEC approval for a bitcoin ETF in the US is unlikely. It\u2019s noteworthy that current bitcoin prices have stabilised around levels observed before this announcement,\u201d he added.\n\nThe low volume and volatility in bitcoin, a rise in US treasury yields, as well as concerns over China\u2019s ailing economy contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s sharp weekly decline, the CoinShares report found.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for the markets in the forthcoming months presents a blend of opportunities and challenges. It\u2019s anticipated that the US Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking rates further in September,\u201d Butterfill said.\n\nA dovish shift in Fed policy could provide a boost to Bitcoin\u2019s prospects, he added.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, investors are eagerly awaiting the SEC\u2019s verdict on the Grayscale ETF and BlackRock applications in September. Anticipations are that decisions on both applications might be postponed, potentially leading to investor disappointment,\u201d Butterfly said.\n\nAlong with bitcoin, ether moved up 0.8 per cent to US$1,683 but remained 8.5 per cent lower for the past seven days.\n\nThe US SEC could approve several ETFs based on Ethereum futures by October 2023, Bloomberg reported on Friday citing unnamed sources. Investment firms Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares have all applied for Ethereum ETF licenses.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, but all posted weekly losses. Cryptocurrencies have seen a total liquidation of US$24.91 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nThat is a considerable decrease on the daily losses posted last week during a calamitous downturn in the cryptocurrency market. On Friday alone, traders liquidated over US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies, including US$851.94 million in long positions \u2013 positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise. On Monday, long position liquidations stood at US$6.89 million for the past 24 hours, according to data from cryptocurrency information platform CoinGlass\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the winners, gaining almost 4 per cent to US$0.5408 but plunged 13.8 per cent for the week.\n\nIn the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres on Thursday granted the SEC permission to appeal an earlier judgment in favour of Ripple Labs. That ruling in late June found that the technology firm\u2019s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws.\n\nIn a Saturday tweet, Ripple\u2019s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said the SEC should not be allowed to appeal until the conclusion of the case. He said that, even if an appeal is granted, \u201cthe case should still continue and the appeal should run in parallel.\u201d"

        "title": "Regulatory Shifts: How Recent Government Actions Impact Bitcoin - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, legislative events have a huge impact on the trajectory of digital assets such as Bitcoin. Governments around the world have been negotiating the complex environment of crypto legislation in recent times, affecting both the market and its participants. These legislative reforms have generated debate about Bitcoin's future and wider acceptance. We dive into current government moves that have impacted the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding the Regulatory Environment\n\nBecause of the unique and borderless character of cryptocurrencies, governments have struggled to categorize and regulate them. Recent actions by many countries demonstrate the diverse approaches being pursued. Regulatory frameworks are being developed to strike a balance between innovation and investor protection and financial stability.\n\nThe Chinese Government's Cryptocurrency Crackdown\n\nChina, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, struck the market a huge hit by imposing stringent regulations on crypto activity. The country's crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading has resulted in a huge shift in the global mining scene. While this caused short-term difficulties, it drove mining businesses to relocate to more favorable areas, diversifying hash power distribution.\n\nEl Salvador Continues to Play Out its Risky Bitcoin Move\n\nTwo years ago, El Salvador proclaimed Bitcoin legal tender in a ground-breaking step that prompted both enthusiasm and trepidation. The Central American country's audacious move heralded a new era in the integration of cryptocurrency into established financial systems. This judgment has significant ramifications for cross-border payments, remittances, and financial inclusion, shedding light on Bitcoin's possibilities beyond speculative speculation.\n\nEurope's Changing Position\n\nEurope has approached cryptocurrency legislation in a varied manner. The European Union imposed Anti-Money Laundering (AML) restrictions on cryptocurrency platforms, demanding more stringent consumer verification procedures. Moreover, the Digital Euro project seems to be inevitable at this point.\n\nFurthermore, some governments, such as Switzerland, have embraced cryptocurrencies by giving legislative certainty and encouraging innovation, whilst others are wary due to worries about consumer protection and market integrity.\n\nThe United States: A Juggling Act\n\nIn the United States, regulatory debates have veered between cautious monitoring and encouraging innovation. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to debate whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities, while other regulatory agencies focus on anti-money laundering and consumer protection concerns. Regulation clarity may create a more stable climate for institutional investors to enter the market.\n\nThe Effects of Bitcoin Market Dynamics\n\nThe development of the regulatory landscape has sent waves across the Bitcoin market dynamics. Price movements frequently correlate with regulatory news, emphasizing the interaction between government actions and investor sentiment. As observed in the aftermath of large announcements, regulatory uncertainty can contribute to increased volatility.\n\nHowever, when regulatory systems improve, they may be able to minimize some of the dramatic price swings by instilling stability and legitimacy. With clearer laws, institutional investors, who are frequently wary of uncertainty, may find a more tempting entry point into the market.\n\nBalancing Innovation and Security\n\nWhile some claim that strict restrictions inhibit innovation, others say that precise guidelines can help crypto players live in a more secure and transparent environment. Finding the correct balance between protecting investors and promoting innovation is a challenge that governments must address.\n\nBitcoin's Long-Term Implications\n\nThe influence of regulatory changes on Bitcoin's future is multifaceted. Clearer laws may boost Bitcoin's legitimacy as a legitimate asset class, luring mainstream investors. Furthermore, regulatory compliance may open the way for Bitcoin-based financial products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be approved.\n\nExcessive regulation, on the other hand, has the potential to hinder innovation and drive some participants to more liberal countries. To ensure that the essence of decentralization and financial inclusivity that cryptocurrencies promise is not hampered, a delicate balance must be maintained.\n\nA Countermeasure Against Central Bank Digital Currencies\n\nThe rise of CBDCs has spurred discussions about individual financial autonomy and privacy. In contrast, Bitcoin emerges as an appealing solution for those seeking to evade the implications of CBDCs. BTC's decentralized nature and robust security features present a compelling alternative.\n\nBTC's decentralized blockchain infrastructure stands in contrast to the centralized control of CBDCs. This decentralization empowers users to transact without intermediaries, preserving financial privacy and autonomy. Additionally, BTC's security track record, rooted in its decentralized architecture, makes it a reliable choice compared to the potential vulnerabilities of centralized CBDC systems.\n\nGlobal accessibility is another advantage of BTC. While CBDCs might struggle with cross-border transactions and interoperability, Bitcoin's borderless nature ensures seamless international transactions, enabling financial inclusion on a global scale.\n\nWhile the decision hinges on individual preferences, Bitcoin provides a powerful option for maintaining financial control and independence in an evolving digital landscape.\n\nExperiencing the Unknown\n\nThe regulatory landscape will undoubtedly shift as the bitcoin market evolves. Governments must adjust their frameworks to the rapid pace of technology changes while protecting their financial systems. Interactions between governments, blockchain technology, and decentralized financial networks are unknown territory, with implications for the future of finance.\n\nFinally, the importance of recent government moves on Bitcoin cannot be overstated. The problems of integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional financial institutions are highlighted by regulatory developments ranging from outright bans to creative acceptances. Bitcoin's future is at the crossroads of these regulatory decisions, which must strike a balance between innovation, security, and investor protection. The crypto community is keeping a careful eye on how governments continue to clarify their stance, expecting how these regulatory moves will ultimately shape the route forward for Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem."

        "title": "BlackRock has more to lose from a BTC price crash pre-Bitcoin ETF - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Numerous theories emerge whenever the price of Bitcoin takes a sudden and steep dive. The usual suspects include government regulations, the possibility of exchanges manipulating prices, Bitcoin (BTC) whales manipulating prices, overleveraged traders and some conspiracies involving Tether (USDT).\n\nSEC kicks Bitcoin ETF can down the road\n\nBetween Aug. 15 and Aug. 18, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a significant 12% decline. This occurrence followed a familiar pattern, prompting a variety of reasons put forth by analysts and experts.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the lack of transparency among exchanges, verifying whether a specific entity influenced the price movement remains a challenging task.\n\nOn Aug. 11, Ceni, a co-founder of Ceni Capital, made a prediction that turned out to be partially accurate. Ceni predicted a Bitcoin price lower than $29,000, anticipating the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would postpone its decision regarding the ARK Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSEC Delays Decision on Ark Invest\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF Application, Calls For Public Input-8 week delay for BlackRock to manipulate the market. 29k should break soon cheap stats for holders and institutional investors. pic.twitter.com/pcBhOho0Ax \u2014 CENI\u2b1b\ufe0f(,) (@ceni0718) August 11, 2023\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that the prediction didn\u2019t specify the timing of this event or the exact support level. As a result, the statistical foundation for this hypothesis becomes less certain.\n\nNonetheless, Ceni has pointed to BlackRock as a potential instigator of Bitcoin\u2019s crash, a claim that warrants thorough investigation.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF is not a short-term deal for BlackRock\n\nThe idea that BlackRock might benefit from a lower Bitcoin price before launching a spot Bitcoin ETF is not as straightforward as it may seem. While the concept of a lower Bitcoin price leading to increased profitability upon ETF launch might be intuitive, there are several reasons why this might not align with BlackRock's broader interests.\n\nFirst and foremost, BlackRock has built a reputation as a respected financial institution based on its commitment to market stability and investor confidence. A sudden and substantial drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value could undermine the overall credibility of the cryptocurrency market, something BlackRock would aim to avoid. The priority of maintaining the market\u2019s legitimacy might outweigh any immediate gains resulting from a low Bitcoin price.\n\nSecondly, obtaining regulatory approval plays a critical role in launching any financial product, especially within the cryptocurrency domain. The SEC meticulously assesses the potential for market manipulation and safeguards for investor protection. Engaging in activities that could be construed as price manipulation could jeopardize BlackRock's chances of securing the necessary regulatory approvals for its ETF offering.\n\nLastly, instilling investor confidence is of paramount importance when introducing any investment product, particularly a novel one like a Bitcoin ETF. A sharp Bitcoin price drop could erode trust among investors, not only in the asset class itself but also in the ETF.\n\nTherefore, BlackRock's interest likely lies in launching the ETF during a period of positive sentiment, where investors feel confident about the potential for future gains.\n\nIf not BlackRock, who's to blame for the BTC price drop?\n\nThe next possibility often considered when trying to explain a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price is the idea that the government will regulate the cryptocurrency sector. The motivation to regulate would be driven by a desire to reduce demand to make the U.S. dollar stronger.\n\nUsually, these theories suggest that steps would be taken to control stablecoins and exchanges that are located outside the United States. Market analyst Joe Kerr talked about this on X (formerly Twitter):\n\nTinfoil hat time:\n\n\n\nSell Government Bitcoin to Coinbase to suppress price.\n\n\n\nGet Binance to defend BNB by selling their Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nDrain Binance\u2019s cheap Bitcoin and sell it to coinbase.\n\n\n\nBinance goes broke & Coinbase has the majority of exchange Bitcoin (SSA req achieved).\n\n\n\nApprove\u2026 \u2014 Joe Kerr\u26a1 (@Boomstick44) August 18, 2023\n\nWhile this theory is interesting, there are challenges and factors that make it seem less likely. First, it\u2019s possible to somewhat track government wallets, but analysts should remember that governments usually have only a small part of all the Bitcoin, so their influence on the whole market is limited.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin speculators are underwater on 88% of their BTC bags \u2014 Research\n\nBetting against the BNB price and other nonsense\n\nNext, the idea of betting against the price of BNB (BNB) might not be as simple as it sounds. To bet against BNB, traders would need to borrow it, but they can\u2019t do that on platforms that follow regulations.\n\nMoreover, by checking Binance's transparency page, a person can see in real-time whether the exchange's Bitcoin wallets are getting smaller compared to other exchanges.\n\nBitcoin balance on exchanges (total), in BTC. Source: Glassnode, @jimmyvs24\n\nThis could suggest unusual things like the improper use of customer money or financial problems. Actual data from these observations is more important than just guessing, as it gives insight into how well the exchange is doing.\n\nUltimately, most of these theories make assumptions and simplify things, ignoring how complex cryptocurrency markets, exchanges and regulations are.\n\nThe real results could be very different from what\u2019s suggested, so while the public might never know the truth for sure, a person can at least dismiss such theories as BlackRock crashing Bitcoin before a spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin price holds $26K as derivatives data hints at end of volatility spike - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In the past few months, Bitcoin traders had grown used to less volatility, but historically, it\u2019s not uncommon for the cryptocurrency to see price swings of 10% in just two or three days. The recent 11.4% correction from $29,340 to $25,980 between Aug. 15 and Aug. 18 took many by surprise and led to the largest liquidation since the FTX collapse in November 2022. But the question remains: Was this correction significant in terms of the market structure?\n\nCertain experts point to reduced liquidity as the reason for the recent spikes in volatility, but is this truly the case?\n\nBTC surged 70%+ in 2023, yet the \"Alameda gap\" - liquidity dip post FTX and Alameda Research collapse - remains, supported by low volatility.\n\n\n\nRead full analysis here: https://t.co/kVslgLQtpL pic.twitter.com/g8Ac7udBl7 \u2014 Kaiko (@KaikoData) August 17, 2023\n\nAs indicated by the Kaiko Data chart, the decline of 2% in the Bitcoin (BTC) order book depth has mirrored the decrease in volatility. It\u2019s possible that market makers adjusted their algorithms to align with the prevailing market conditions.\n\nHence, delving into the derivatives market to assess the impact of the drop to $26,000 seems reasonable. This examination aims to determine whether whales and market makers have become bearish or if they\u2019re demanding higher premiums for protective hedge positions.\n\nTo begin, traders should identify similar instances in the recent past, and two events stand out:\n\nBitcoin/USD price index, 2023. Source: TradingView\n\nThe first decline took place from March 8 to March 10, causing Bitcoin to plummet by 11.4% to $19,600, marking its lowest point in over seven weeks at that time. This correction followed the liquidation of Silvergate Bank, a crucial operational partner for multiple cryptocurrency firms.\n\nThe subsequent significant move occurred between April 19 and April 21, resulting in a 10.4% drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price. It revisited the $27,250 level for the first time in more than three weeks after Gary Gensler, the chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, addressed the House Financial Services Committee. Gensler\u2019s statements provided little reassurance that the agency\u2019s enforcement-driven regulatory efforts would cease.\n\nNot every 10% Bitcoin price crash is the same\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures generally tend to trade with a slight premium when compared to spot markets. This reflects sellers\u2019 inclination to receive additional compensation in return for delaying the settlement. Healthy markets usually see BTC futures contracts being traded with an annualized premium ranging from 5 to 10%. This situation, termed \u201ccontango,\" is not unique to the cryptocurrency domain.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures premium, March/April 2023. Source: Laevitas\n\nLeading up to the crash on March 8, Bitcoin\u2019s futures premium was at 3.5%, indicating a moderate level of comfort. However, when Bitcoin\u2019s price dipped below $20,000, there was an intensified sense of pessimism, causing the indicator to shift to a discount of 3.5%. This phenomenon, referred to as \"backwardation,\" is typical of bearish market conditions.\n\nConversely, the correction on April 19 had minimal impact on Bitcoin's futures main metric, with the premium remaining around 3.5% as the BTC price revisited $27,250. This could imply that professional traders were either highly confident in the soundness of the market structure or were well-prepared for the 10.4% correction.\n\nThe 11.4% BTC crash between Aug. 15 and Aug. 18, reveals distinct dissimilarities from previous instances. The starting point for Bitcoin\u2019s futures premium was higher, surpassing the 5% neutral threshold.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures premium, August 2023. Source: Laevitas\n\nNotice how rapidly the derivatives market absorbed the shock on Aug. 18. The BTC futures premium swiftly returned to a 6% neutral-to-bullish position. This suggests that the decline to $26,000 did not significantly dampen the optimism of whales and market makers regarding the cryptocurrency.\n\nOptions markets confirm lack of bearish momentum\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused pro traders to become more risk-averse. In short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the delta skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a -7% skew.\n\nRelated: Why is the crypto market down today?\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nData indicate excessive demand for call (buy) BTC options ahead of the Aug. 15 crash, with the indicator at -11%. This trend changed over the subsequent five days, though the metric remained within the neutral range and was unable to breach the 7% threshold.\n\nUltimately, both Bitcoin options and futures metrics reveal no signs of professional traders adopting a bearish stance. While this doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee a swift return of BTC to the $29,000 support level, it does reduce the likelihood of an extended price correction.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCredible Crypto pointed out the market fractals\n\nHowever, fractals are not adequate per our analysis\n\nBitcoin is likely headed further down in the near-term\n\nAfter reaching $31,400 the price of Bitcoin started moving sideways before making a sharp downturn of almost 20% in the recent market crash. Still, the price is up by 68% since November 21, and on a macro level, we are still in an uptrend.\n\nThis type of sharp downturn was seen in late February to early March, and yet the price made a new high. Looking at the market structure and some fundamentals, many have maintained their bullish outlook.\n\nAmong those is a crypto analysis, popular on Twitter, Credible Crypto , who took it to the platform to discuss his stance. According to him, the price structure is similar to that of March to August 2020, just right before Bitcoin took off to a new all-time high.\n\nIn this analysis, we will cover this possibility and re-examine his analysis.\n\nCrediBULL Crypto Analysis\n\nIn his Twitter post , Credible Crypto analyzed the market structure and pointed out the market fractality. First saying that both of these structures \u2013 from April to present, and from March to August 2020 are sideways in essence.\n\n\u201cRanging structures occurring after a clean/clear impulse (uptrend) and near vertical rally off a major low- which makes me believe that the goal here is re-accumulation- and so technical context is the same,\u201d Credible Crypto said in his Twitter post .\n\nHe interprets this as the accumulation range from which, if the price breakout, it will be poised for massive price spikes as we saw in 2020 when Bitcoin increased by 200% at first, to its $16,000 \u2013 $18,000 range, and then proceeded to make further advances.\n\nThis scenario will get invalidated if the price of Bitcoin continues to move to the downside below $24.800. If this level gets broken, lower targets could be seen, and the fractal structure he is referring to would be broken as well.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nAs we have pointed out in our previous analyses, there are two scenarios in play for the price of Bitcoin, but in both, we are expecting near-term downside movement. We have either seen the start of the bull cycle on November 21, when this increase began, or we have seen a corrective three-wave move from June 18 last year. In both cases, this upward movement ended in July.\n\nThis is why we are either expecting a corrective ABC that will establish the first bull market higher low in the zone between $22,000 \u2013 $20,000, or a move for the final bear market low, potentially in the zone of $11,000.\n\nIn Elliott Wave theory, market fractality is highly important, and examining the mentioned fractals according to the Credible Crypto, they are not the same. His referred sideways zones are not to be compared, primarily because of their context. In March 2020, we saw a large 50% decrease following a recovery of 170% to the same levels, which all occurred in a matter of 66 days and formed a V shape which is usually seen in the market bottoms.\n\nIn contrast, the recent zone he pointed to be fractal with the mentioned one is after the rise of 100% and lasted for 145 days. This is more of a sign of struggle but also indecision, meaning that investors are slowly waiting to see a decisive move, but there isn\u2019t anyone pushing the price. This is why we have seen a sharp decline, amplified but long liquidations.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs per our chart analysis, we will see further lows, below the invalidation point of $24,800 of the Credible Crypto scenario. His fractal comparison is inadequate, and the likelihood of the price of Bitcoin heading for a 200% surge is very small, although not impossible.\n\nNow that the price is in a freefall, it first needs to establish strong support in order to shoot back up. From the support level it reaches, we are going to reexamine this possibility, but for now, the chance is slim to none.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

Some industry observers are pointing towards the likelihood that the owner could be a centralized exchange, and Gemini has been floated as a potential candidate.\n\nGemini has transferred bitcoins to the new address bc1q\u2026.59v2 in the past 3 months. It currently holds 118,000 bitcoins, or about 3.08 billion U.S. dollars. It is currently the third largest bitcoin holder. The first and second largest Bitcoin addresses are Binance Cold Wallet\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 22, 2023\n\nSome members of the Crypto Twitter community have suggested that the wallet might be linked to BlackRock, the largest asset management in the world. The foundation for this theory lies in the timing of the wallet transactions with BlackRock\u2019s recent filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF product last month.\n\nBitcoin is down by 1.2% in the last 24 hours and has experienced a decline of over 11% throughout the week, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nNodal Power has secured a substantial $13 million funding round to continue converting methane gas produced by landfills into electricity, which is then dispatched to local electricity grids as renewable power.\n\nNot all of that energy will be sold, however. Some of it will be used directly by the firm to secure the blockchain through clean Bitcoin mining.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is a secondary tool we use when grid economics aren't as favorable,\u201d said Matthew Jones, Nodal Power\u2019s co-founder and chief operating officer, told Decrypt. \u201cWe currently only do Bitcoin mining in our data centers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMethane, a potent greenhouse gas resulting from organic matter decomposition in landfills, largely contributes to global warming. That\u2019s because research suggests that it is 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide.\n\nNodal Power captures and repurposes this leaked methane gas by combusting it in a generator to produce power. This reduces carbon emissions when compared to simply flaring off the methane, making a profit from an otherwise wasted resource while keeping the atmosphere cleaner.\n\nCurrently, Nodal Power operates two mining data centers in the US, with plans for a third in early 2024. The first and largest site, located in the \u201csouthwest US,\u201d primarily exports electricity to the local power utility, while the second site, situated in the \u201cmountainous western region,\u201d powers 500 miners for 40 petahashes per second (PH/s) of capacity.\n\nThe third site, backed by the $13 million funding, will mirror the second site in terms of power, mining capacity, and location.\n\n\u201cProbably noteworthy that our largest facility is the smallest Bitcoin deployment because a majority of the time we dispatch the electricity to the grid instead of using it ourselves,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIncreasing awareness of how much of a climate hazard landfills are, and that power generation is the best use in most caseshttps://t.co/TICnOf3IyB ... problem is 75% of landfills can't sell to the grid so must use that power onsite If only we had a user of that power onsite \u2014 Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) August 22, 2023\n\nWhile most of that power is then sold to the grid like a \u201ctraditional power plant,\u201d practical considerations force 75% of landfills to use that methane on site, according to Daniel Batten, co-founder of CH4 Capital. Batten\u2019s $400 million fund invests in companies that intend to use landfill gas to mine Bitcoin.\n\nA recent KPMG report suggested that the volume of flared methane in the U.S. and Canada could potentially power the entire Bitcoin network."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency-related stocks including Riot Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT), Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA) and Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) gapped down on August 18 on news that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX had unloaded all its bitcoin.\n\nAll those stocks were already significantly lower for the month of August, as cryptocurrencies were falling. While some analysts expect a crypto rebound in the not-so-distant future, others see the stock languishing for longer.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price fell by 1.94% on August 18, to $26,109.90, after rallying in July.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Musk has sold bitcoin; last year, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) sold $936 million of the digital currency. In the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings report, it said the value of its digital assets was $184 million, the same as in the previous two quarters.\n\nRiot Platforms, Marathon Digital and Coinbase have similar trading patterns: Each stock broke out of a base in June or July, rallied to its best levels in over a year, then began pulling back the week ended July 21 as the price of bitcoin fell.\n\nRiot Platforms\n\nBuried deep in the notes of Riot\u2019s 10Q, the official regulatory filing of its most recent quarterly results, you\u2019ll find details regarding a power supply contract with Texas energy provider TXU Energy Retail Co., to sell electricity to power the Lone Star State.\n\nThat\u2019s a small source of revenue, but it hints at the company\u2019s diversified operations, at a time when the crypto-mining industry is facing low prices for its core asset.\n\nThe company also derives revenue from providing engineered electrical equipment products to third-party customers, and offers data-center hosting for institutional customers.\n\nRiot, whose market capitalization is $1.938 billion, had a revenue increase of 5% in the most recent quarter, following three quarters of earnings declines. The company has not yet posted a profit, and analysts have no expectations of that in the next two years.\n\nMarathon Digital\n\nAccording to regulatory filings from the Fort Lauderdale, Florida company, Marathon\u2019s strategy is to produce and hold bitcoin, after paying for cash operating costs of production, as a long-term investment.\n\nLike Riot Platforms, Marathon is also looking to expand and diversify income sources.\n\n\u201cWe may also explore opportunities to become involved in businesses ancillary to our bitcoin mining business as favorable market conditions and opportunities arise,\u201d the company says.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, reported on August 8, Marathon significantly narrowed its loss to 13 cents a share, an improvement over the year-earlier loss of $1.94 a share.\n\nIn May, the company received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, pertaining to alleged securities laws violations. That news didn\u2019t appreciably harm the stock, which continued forming a base that it cleared on June 23.\n\nWith shares down 32.90% in the past month, the stock is not actionable at this time. Sure, value-seekers will eventually swoop in, but the timing of that could be tricky, as the stock\u2019s downside momentum is strong.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase, the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, is the largest holding in two of Cathie Woods\u2019 Ark ETFs: The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKF) and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA: ARKW).\n\nThe latter fund has been selling shares in recent weeks, but Coinbase still comprises 8.73% of fund assets.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $17.36 billion, Coinbase is in a different position than smaller bitcoin companies. Its business model doesn\u2019t involve mining bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. That arguably allows it more flexibility and increased ability to weather downturns in the price of underlying digital assets.\n\nIts second-quarter earnings report, issued on August 3, showed the company has been trimming expenses, and emphasizing recurring revenue in the form of subscriptions and services. The latter includes custodial fees for holding assets, as well as interest income. It\u2019s the first time trading didn\u2019t constitute the bulk of quarterly revenue.\n\nWhile Coinbase successfully weathered the debacle facing fellow exchange FTX, it, too, has fallen under regulators\u2019 scrutiny. In January, it agreed to pay New York State $50 million to settle allegations that it violated money-laundering laws. As part of that deal, Coinbase also invested $50 million into a state regulatory compliance program aimed at stopping future incidents.\n\nThat\u2019s a hefty payment, as the company\u2019s most recent quarterly revenue totaled $707 million.\n\nAs with the smaller bitcoin-related stocks that tumbled on the SpaceX news, it\u2019s best to keep an eye on Coinbase if you\u2019re thinking about a purchase, and give yourself some extra insurance as it begins turning higher again.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The precious resource has fueled economic, financial, and political development across these nations.\n\nHowever, with an international shift toward renewable energy and sustainability, many Middle Eastern countries, such as the United Arab Emirates and Oman, are now shifting their economic powers towards the new age of trade.\n\nOman is now taking strides toward a shift to digital assets. The nation has recently announced its hefty investment in processing machines and mining centers, signaling a new dawn of economics in the nation.\n\nUAE Pushes Crypto Forward\n\nAs of April 17th, the Securities And Commodities Authority (SCA) AND UAE Central Bank started accepting applications from companies intending to provide cryptocurrency services within the country.\n\nFurthermore, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), described as \u201cthe world\u2019s first, tailor-made Virtual Asset regime\u201d released its Full Market Product (FMP) Regulations.\n\nThe regulatory framework explains in detail how the government plans to govern crypto market conduct, licensing, company operations, and cybersecurity. Moreover, FMP regulations pinpoint regulations meant for VARA-licensed companies.\n\nNow, the UAE is on the hunt for crypto institutions that deviate from VARA regulations, tightening up control of the industry to protect local customers.\n\nDubai\u2019s crypto regulator struck a $2.7 million penalty on OPNX, a venture by Three Arrows Capital founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, for alleged violations in promoting virtual assets.\n\nOPNX was found to collect personal information on Emirati customers, which is not permitted under VARA. As a result, OPNX was served a cease and desist directive from the regulating body.\n\nHowever, OPNX UAE customers still found promotions and marketing messages from OPNX after the directive was served.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates and adjacent Middle Eastern nations such as Oman aim for an assertive entry into the digital asset space through a slew of vast investments and continuously updated market regulations.\n\n$370 Million For Hosting & Mining\n\nEngineer Said Hamoud, Oman\u2019s Minister of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology (MTCIT), led the inauguration of The Afaaq for Advanced Technologies data hosting and crypto mining center on August 13th.\n\nImplemented by Exahertz International, the center is valued at 135 million Omani Rials (about $370 million). The center is also the country\u2019s second-largest venture into the space, with the first being Al-Madina Al-Khadraa, which is valued at around 150 million Omani Rials.\n\nEngineer Hamoud highlighted the significance of the investments that total 285 Omani Rials as a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d in the country\u2019s journey towards digital transformation. The minister also pointed out the potential for job creation following the emergence of the industry in the Middle Eastern country.\n\nThe minister also commented on Afaaq, calling it \u201ca leading player in the data hosting and processing sector, and we are confident that they will be a valuable asset to Oman\u2019s digital economy\u201d.\n\nSam Ferdows, CEO of Moonwalk Systems and Strategic Partner of Exahertz International revealed plans to create a wider network of blockchain-based data centers in Oman. He also stated that operations have already reached 11 megawatts of power and over 2,000 machines. Finally, he predicts operations will reach 15,000 machines by October to cover different centers around Oman.\n\nFerdows also states that the company will be providing knowledge and expertise as part of the implementation process."

The filing purports to dismantle many of the plaintiff's claims, the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund said in a statement on Monday.\n\nWright claims to own 111,000 Bitcoin that were allegedly stolen from the Mt Gox exchange. The defense notes that Wright lacks any documentation showing ownership of the missing Bitcoin, and accuse him of fabricating the limited documents provided to the court.\n\n\u201c[We] seek to have this claim struck out on the ground that it is a fraudulent claim and an abuse of process,\u201d Timothy Elliss, an attorney with Enyo Law LLP, said in the filing. \u201cThey seek disclosure and other case management directions to enable this threshold issue of fraud to be determined as a preliminary issue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA preliminary issue application is a legal tool that aims to resolve specific issues before a trial by addressing key points and potentially saving time and money for those involved in the proceedings.

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Bitcoin ordinals, a prominent type of non-fungible token (NFT), have faced a staggering drop in their trading activity. DappRadar, a leading analytics platform, revealed that Bitcoin ordinals transactions plummeted by a significant 97%, totalling 20,571 in mid-August. The NFT's trading volumes, a critical indicator of user engagement, experienced a jaw-dropping decline of 98% since May.DappRadar's data, disclosed on August 17, portrayed a grim picture of the Bitcoin ordinals market. The sales, which soared to a zenith of $452 million in May, dwindled to approximately $3 million by August 14. The situation raises concerns over the long-term viability of Bitcoin-based NFTs. While DappRadar highlighted the substantial decrease in sales volume and transaction count, it underscored the need for further analysis to determine whether this decline is merely a \"temporary setback\" or a systemic issue.However, DappRadar emphasised the need for additional time to gauge the implications of this decline accurately. While market dynamics can contribute to fluctuations in sales volume, the consistent decline in transaction count raises broader concerns. The report suggested that the dwindling transaction count might reflect reduced trader engagement with Bitcoin ordinals, potentially impacting the long-term relevance and sustainability of these NFTs in the growing NFT space.This sudden drop in Bitcoin ordinals NFT trading volume comes after a bustling second quarter, during which trading volumes and user activity experienced a substantial surge compared to this year's first quarter. However, the sustainability of the ordinals market is at a crossroads due to the divided outlook within the Bitcoin community regarding the role of NFTs on the network.While Ethereum and other blockchains have integrated NFTs with little controversy, the Bitcoin community appears divided. Some consider Bitcoin \"digital gold,\" emphasising its role as a store of value, while others question the integration of NFTs onto the Bitcoin network.The upcoming months are anticipated to play a pivotal role in determining the fate of Bitcoin-based NFTs. The industry will closely watch whether Bitcoin ordinals rebound from this setback, or the coin potentially reverts to its original function as a store of value as the NFT landscape evolves.As the crypto realm navigates these shifts, stakeholders and enthusiasts alike are left with crucial questions about the future trajectory of Bitcoin-based NFTs and their role in the rapidly transforming world of digital currencies and decentralised finance."

        "title": "Bitcoin 4 Year Cycle Explained: What Can Traders Expect? - AMBCrypto Blog",
        "content": "In the realm of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the undisputed king. Intricately tied to its reign is a unique phenomenon known as the \u201cBitcoin 4 year cycle.\u201d This cyclic event holds significant sway over Bitcoin\u2019s price movement and can influence trading decisions.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we delve into the mechanics of this cycle, covering everything you need to know. Moreover, we will examine what traders can anticipate from it.\n\nNavigating the Bitcoin landscape\n\nBTC, a decentralized digital currency, operates on a technology called blockchain. This network involves \u201cnodes\u201d or computers running Bitcoin\u2019s software that validate transactions.\n\nEach transaction is individually approved and added to the existing blockchain, a public ledger. A subset of these nodes are \u201cminers,\u201d who participate in the validation process, also known as \u201cBitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nUnveiling the BTC mining process\n\nBitcoin mining is a crucial aspect of Bitcoin\u2019s operation. Miners, using their computational power, solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. The Bitcoin network employs a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Work (PoW).\n\nMiners compete to solve the problem first, and the winner is rewarded with BTC. This reward system forms the crux of the Bitcoin 4 year cycle.\n\nIf you\u2019re a crypto enthusiast, don\u2019t miss out on the latest details on Shibarium.\n\nThe Bitcoin 4 year cycle explained\n\nThe Bitcoin 4 year cycle refers to a recurring pattern of price fluctuations that Bitcoin experiences approximately every 4 years. This cyclical pattern is intrinsically linked to the process of Bitcoin halving, a built-in feature of Bitcoin\u2019s code that halves the mining reward every 210,000 blocks, roughly every four years.\n\nThe first halving occurred in 2012, reducing the block reward from 50 to 25 bitcoins. Subsequent halvings in 2016 and 2020 further reduced the reward to 12.5 and then 6.25 bitcoins, respectively. The next anticipated halving is in 2024 when the reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoins.\n\nDissecting the phases of the Bitcoin 4 year cycle\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what this cycle has historically looked like:\n\nPhase 1: Halving event\n\nThis is where it starts. The halving mechanism is designed to slow the rate of new Bitcoin creation over time, ultimately capping the supply at 21 million.\n\nPhase 2: Bull phase\n\nSometime after the halving (often several months), the reduced supply of new BTC entering the market starts to have a noticeable effect. Coupled with increasing demand, the price of BTC begins to rise.\n\nThis initiates a bullish phase where the price increases significantly. Media attention, fear of missing out (FOMO) from retail investors, and institutional interest can amplify this effect.\n\nPhase 3: Parabolic peak\n\nAfter a period of strong growth, the price increase often becomes parabolic. Historically, this has led to a sharp and unsustainable price spike, marking the peak of the bull market.\n\nPhase 4: Bear phase\n\nFollowing the peak, there\u2019s typically a significant correction. Prices can drop dramatically from their highs, leading to a bearish phase that can last for months or even years.\n\nThe decline often shakes out speculators and is marked by reduced media attention, pessimism, and often a focus on technology and infrastructure growth rather than just price.\n\nPhase 5: Accumulation phase\n\nAs the bear market bottoms out, a quieter accumulation phase often begins. During this time, long-term believers in the technology (often called \u201chodlers\u201d) and savvy investors accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices, setting the stage for the next cycle.\n\nPhase 6: Pre-halving anticipation\n\nAs the next halving event approaches, there\u2019s often renewed interest and speculation about its potential effects on the price. This can sometimes lead to a pre-halving rally. Then, the cycle repeats with the next halving.\n\nWhat can traders expect from the Bitcoin 4 year cycle?\n\n1. Increased publicity and awareness\n\nHalving events tend to attract media attention, which can lead to increased public interest in Bitcoin. New traders and investors may enter the space, potentially leading to higher trading volumes and volatility.\n\n2. Speculative activity\n\nAs with any significant event in the crypto world, speculation can run rampant. Traders might try to anticipate the price movement before the halving and react quickly to any changes afterward. This speculative activity can introduce volatility in the market.\n\n3. Shift in network security\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin doesn\u2019t increase in tandem with the halving, and mining becomes less profitable, some miners might shut down their operations. This can lead to a temporary decrease in the network\u2019s hash rate (the total computational power used to mine and process Bitcoin transactions).\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty adjustment mechanism would eventually make mining easier, inviting miners back into the network and restoring security.\n\n4. New investment opportunities\n\nThe halving could create new investment opportunities in Bitcoin mining and other related businesses. Traders should be aware of these opportunities and do their research before investing.\n\n5. Long-term valuation thesis\n\nThe reduction in Bitcoin\u2019s issuance rate can make the asset more scarce over time, potentially supporting a long-term valuation thesis. Investors who believe in Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition might see the halving as a confirmation of its decreasing inflation rate.\n\n6. Sentiment analysis\n\nGiven the attention and discussions around halving events, traders might also monitor sentiment in the market. Positive sentiment could potentially bolster bullish movements, while negative sentiment might have the opposite effect.\n\nStrategies for profiting from the Bitcoin 4 year cycle\n\nLong-term holding (HODLing)\n\nBuy and hold : The simplest strategy involves purchasing Bitcoin at what you believe is a low point in the cycle (often during the accumulation phase or the bear market) and holding it through the entire cycle.\n\n: The simplest strategy involves purchasing Bitcoin at what you believe is a low point in the cycle (often during the accumulation phase or the bear market) and holding it through the entire cycle. Dollar-cost averaging: Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, you can spread out your purchases over time. This reduces the impact of volatility and can lead to a better average entry price over time.\n\nSwing trading\n\nBuy the dip : During the bull phase, there can be significant corrections (or dips). Some traders aim to buy during these dips and sell on recoveries.\n\n: During the bull phase, there can be significant corrections (or dips). Some traders aim to buy during these dips and sell on recoveries. Sell the peak: If you believe the market is approaching a parabolic peak or is overextended, you might decide to sell a portion or all of your holdings. Knowing Technical price analysis, how to trace Bitcoin address and On-chain movements can help you make informed swing trades.\n\nFutures and options trading\n\nExperienced traders can use derivatives like futures and options to hedge their holdings or profit from price movements. However, these instruments can be risky and are not recommended for beginners.\n\nDay trading\n\nDay trading entails purchasing and offloading Bitcoin daily to capitalize on brief price shifts. Moreover, day traders use technical analysis and market news to identify profitable trading opportunities.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin 4 year cycle can be a powerful tool for traders and investors. By aligning your trading strategies with the phases of the cycle, you can potentially profit from Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and trading it carries significant risks. Always do your own research and consider seeking professional financial advice before making any investment decisions.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nInstitutions are \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the SEC\u2019s lack of decision-making regarding an ETF, according to the most recent report from CoinShares, prompting a widespread sell-off by large entities totalling an impressive $55 million worth of digital asset outflows in the past seven days.\n\nAs James Butterfill, head of research for CoinShares wrote, \u201cDisappointment from SEC ETF decisions has impacted sentiment,\u201d with Bitcoin\u2019s outflows reversing last week\u2019s purchases worth $27 million.\n\nButterfill explained to Decrypt that this sudden downturn appears to be caused by an \u201coverhyped market\u201d that realized a Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t as imminent as it once seemed. He added that \u201cfears of a Chinese-based economic downturn\u201d haven\u2019t helped.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the analyst, the summer doldrums are in full effect, with low trading volume plaguing the market. With $2.3 billion in daily volume versus $11 billion at the beginning of the year, these numbers have left the market \u201cmore vulnerable to larger trades,\u201d said Butterfill.\n\nCanada and Germany marked the week for solid selling by institutions in their territories, with $35 million and $11 million respectively. The sole exception was the land of the Red Cross, Switzerland, clocking $3.5 million worth of inflows.\n\nLast week\u2019s institutional outflows were not limited to only Bitcoin (BTC), which currently trades at $25,910 according to Coingecko.\n\nMost altcoins suffered a drop in buying interest by institutions, with Ethereum (ETH) witnessing $9 million worth of selling. Along with the second largest crypto by market capitalization, Polygon (MATIC), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) suffered outflows of under $1 million.\n\nBulls continue to lead the way for Ripple (XRP), as the fifth largest cryptocurrency notches 17 straight weeks' worth of inflows, marking $1.2 million in the past seven days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe numbers provided by CoinShares align with the surprise flash crash in crypto prices last week.\n\nDigital assets saw blood in the streets after Bitcoin shed nearly 11% of its value, and dipped to prices it hadn\u2019t seen since the beginning of June. A cascade in liquidations ensued, with over $800 million wiped from the total market capitalization.\n\nAccording to Coingecko, Ethereum currently changes hands at $1,656, a 10.5% drop on the week, along with the majority of blue-chip crypto assets recording double digit losses for the past seven days.\n\nNevertheless, Butterfill told Decrypt he \u201cexpects volumes to rise\u201d with the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium and the Federal Reserve's potential decision on interest rates.\n\nIt definitely appears that Institutions are siding with the bears as the crypto market continues to hold its breath for a much-anticipated (and much-awaited) spot Bitcoin ETF, and for the markets to find something to hold onto."

        "title": "What are peer-to-peer payments, and how can they work offline? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is a peer-to-peer payment protocol, and how does it work? Peer-to-peer (P2P) payment protocols are sets of rules and standards that enable transactions directly between two parties without intermediaries like banks or payment processors. P2P payment protocols increase security with cryptographic encryptions and provide lower transaction fees, as there are no intermediaries involved. Blockchain-based P2P protocols are widely used in the crypto ecosystem. Users who wish to utilize P2P payments create a wallet and connect it to their chosen platform through a generally streamlined process. Sending funds is a seamless process: Just enter the amount and the recipient\u2019s wallet address, then press send. After the transaction is initiated, validators verify and add the transaction to the block \u2014 a decentralized ledger containing all blocks of data, which is where the \u201cblockchain\u201d name comes from. The recipient can freely use or transfer the received funds afterward.\n\nIs Bitcoin truly a peer-to-peer protocol? Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin (BTC), labeled the original cryptocurrency as \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash\u201d in its white paper. However, that definition needs a deeper look. In true P2P payment systems, the sender and the receiver should be able to perform the transaction without any intermediaries. In Bitcoin\u2019s case, blockchain nodes, called \u201cminers,\u201d act as mediators. Users can\u2019t transact without an internet connection, as Bitcoin needs to connect to the miners for mediation to process the transaction. Therefore, it\u2019s more accurate to say that Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer network rather than saying it is a peer-to-peer payment protocol itself.\n\nWhy did Satoshi Nakamoto describe Bitcoin as \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash\u201d? In the context of Bitcoin\u2019s P2P network, \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d refers to the individual nodes connecting directly to each other to share information and validate transactions. The \u201celectronic\u201d part is because Bitcoin isn\u2019t a physical currency like traditional cash and exists only in the digital space. Nakamoto emphasized Bitcoin\u2019s use as an everyday transaction currency by calling it \u201ccash,\u201d referring to the widely accepted and easily transferable form of money, used by most people worldwide. Nakamoto envisioned Bitcoin as a replacement for traditional fiat currencies.\n\nWhat about other digital payment systems? Every digital payment system used today employs intermediaries for transactions. Banks, which mediate bank transfers, are the most common. For credit card systems, credit card issuers are the intermediaries in transactions between the card owner and the merchant through a point-of-sale (POS) device. Both the credit card and the POS device are linked to the credit card company\u2019s system. So, in the event of a system shutdown, all credit card users will be unable to pay for a haircut or purchase coffee. This is called a single point of failure, where all users rely on a sole system for their daily payment requirements.\n\nWhat would it take for CBDCs to be considered peer-to-peer? A central bank digital currency, simply known as CBDC, is a digital form of a country\u2019s fiat currency issued and regulated by the central bank. Crucial to achieving financial inclusion, offline payments play a key role in CBDCs\u2019 case. CBDC holders need to be able to transact with each other even when there is no internet connection. This is especially important for people with lower income levels who may not be able to afford an internet subscription, enabling them to use CBDCs offline. The most distinctive aspect of physical cash is its P2P payment functionality, which allows people to exchange value without intermediaries. If digitizing and replacing paper-based cash is the goal, preserving this vital feature while offering offline payments is paramount.\n\nWhat is machine-to-machine commerce, and how can it benefit from P2P payments? In the near future, Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart electric cars and smart fridges will pay each other automatically, paving the way for machine-to-machine (M2M) commerce. For example, electric cars will charge themselves at charging stations, and refrigerators will order food and drinks as needed. CBDCs can be used to facilitate these M2M transactions in a safe environment, as they are already government-issued and regulated. IoT devices can be connected to their owner\u2019s wallets, enabling them to make authorized purchases autonomously. The M2M commerce market is expected to grow from $37 billion in 2023 to $57 billion by 2032, nearly doubling itself in value \u2014 a growth that comes with a significant load in terms of transactions. In the age of M2M commerce, the world will need an infrastructure that can support billions of transactions per second. Having an intermediary only adds more fatigue to the payment network. A true P2P payment system will be essential to meeting the needs of the potential volume of M2M commerce.\n\nDo we even need these peer-to-peer protocols? Yes. P2P protocols support smart contracts and blockchain, which assist automatization and decentralization. As the transactions are \u201cpeer-to-peer,\u201d a P2P protocol would also enhance security and privacy while making it easier for entities to transact across borders and overseas, promoting globalization and adoption. They offer lower transaction costs and process transactions faster by removing third parties. If finance is to be kept on par with the current standard, where everything is slowly being digitized, achieving true peer-to-peer facilitation is pivotal.\n\nIs there a true peer-to-peer payment solution available? Sovereign Wallet, an identity-based blockchain technology company focused on digital asset management and identity solutions, provides a true peer-to-peer solution with its flagship product, MetaMUI. MetaMUI is a peer-to-peer protocol featuring offline payment, direct cross-border payment and scalability to cover M2M commerce without intermediaries. MetaMUI facilitates payments without a need for an internet connection. Source: Sovereign Wallet The integration of MetaMUI could allow CBDCs to transact without internet access. Users of the MetaMUI CBDC could also directly transfer funds to those in other countries using different MetaMUI CBDCs, without any settlement currencies or regulatory barriers getting involved. In its chain code, MetaMUI leverages edge computing, which refers to data processing and computation closer to the data source, such as IoT devices, instead of centralized servers or the cloud, which decelerates the process. By implementing edge computing, the MetaMUI CBDC can execute smart contracts in a P2P manner directly between devices, enabling it to be used in M2M commerce."

Similarly, significant alternative cryptocurrencies like Ethereum fell 9.7%, Ripple lost 16.9%, Solana crashed 13.3%, and memecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu declined nearly 16%.The broader market was already in a bear phase, but Bitcoin faced an 8% plunge on August 18 as Elon Musk's SpaceX reportedly divested its Bitcoin holdings, akin to Tesla.SpaceX had accumulated $373 million in Bitcoin during 2021-2022.\"Bitcoin's fall below $26,000 last week was the biggest decline for BTC in almost over a year,\" said Siddhartha Gupta, SVP, business and strategic alliances, CoinDCX.Simultaneously, investor concerns were heightened by the US Federal Reserve's July minutes suggesting possible interest rate hikes. Moreover, large Bitcoin holders selling off their investments in the futures market and China's second-largest property developer, China Evergrande, filing for US bankruptcy, added to the uncertainty to the economic landscape.\"Market sentiments changed very quickly after the Tesla news and then there was a bunch of negative news which just kept adding to the prevailing uncertainty. It looks like bearish sentiment will remain until there is more regulatory clarity,\" said Vishal Gupta, a Noida-based crypto investor.Many Indian cryptocurrency investors have halted their investments following a 30% tax on crypto earnings enforced by the government. Nonetheless, a minority continues to retain their holdings, though sudden market downturns are compounding the prevailing pessimism.\"Due to unfriendly policies of the government, I have sold most of all the crypto I held. It's not looking good for crypto or any risk asset that is non-productive, does not produce cash flow. Rising interest rates will hit speculative assets the hardest,\" said Ashwin Nadar, an avid Mumbai-based crypto tracker.Dhruvil Shah-SVP of technology, Liminal, a wallet infrastructure and custody solutions platform, said the regulatory uncertainty dampens the enthusiasm within the digital asset community and results in a liquidity crunch in the market.\"The second half of 2023 has been a phase of price correction across digital assets, including Bitcoin. The short-term outlook for BTC looks bearish as BTC can correct even further into the 20-25k range in the short term. We can expect some green shoots by the end of September or the beginning of October this year,\" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, India's second longest-running digital asset exchange.Despite the prevailing circumstances, a modest level of trading persisted on Indian crypto exchanges throughout the past week."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Follows This 1930\u2019s Chart, Why BTC Could Keep On Falling - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Volatility is back for the Bitcoin price and the crypto market, but it currently favors the bears as value tumbles in the past few days. The nascent sector was moving sideways, but a liquidation cascade forced prices into critical support levels, but the worse might yet come if BTC fulfills a prophecy.\n\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin price trades at $26,100 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the price of BTC corrected back to $26,000 after its lost support at the high of its current levels.\n\nIs The Worst Yet To Come For The Bitcoin Price?\n\nBloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Senior Commodity Analyst Mike McGlone shared an analysis on social media platform X. Therein, the analyst classified Bitcoin as one of the \u201cbest-performing assets in history,\u201d the cryptocurrency rose from $100 to around $70,000 in less than ten years.\n\nAt the same time, McGlone pointed out the similarities between the Bitcoin price chart and the 1930s stock market chart. During this period, the US economy went through one of its worse history leading to a series of economic reforms.\n\nComparing both sectors, McGlone forecasted a potential drop in the Bitcoin price once the US Federal Reserve (Fed) turns its monetary policy around. As seen in the chart below, the financial institution has raised interest rates to slow down inflation.\n\nAs a result, BTC\u2019s price has declined as liquidity leaves financial markets and uncertainty increases. Unlike popular belief, the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst expects the cryptocurrency to dip further if the Fed loses its monetary policy. McGlone explained:\n\nOne of the best-performing assets in history and a leading indicator \u2014 Bitcoin \u2014 appears similar to the stock market in 1930. Statistician and entrepreneur Roger Babson began warning about elevated equity prices well before economist Irving Fisher proclaimed a \u201cpermanently high plateau\u201d in 1929. The Fed tilts our bias toward a stance similar to Babson\u2019s.\n\nThe analyst above focuses on the increasing potential benefits for investors getting out of BTC and into government-based financial instruments, such as US Treasury notes which are currently yielding 5%. As long as this environment continues, BTC shows \u201cmostly downward biases,\u201d as the analyst concluded.\n\nOn short timeframes, the price of BTC continues to trade sideways, licking its wounds from last week\u2019s liquidation cascades. The last time the cryptocurrency experienced a similar price action was in late 2022, and it took several weeks of sideways price action before a recovery was possible.\n\nCover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "What to expect from Bitcoin in the future? - Times of Malta",
        "content": "The future of Bitcoin is hard to predict because of its prominence as the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. Bitcoin has been gaining wider acceptance as a form of digital currency and a store of value. As more companies, institutions, and individuals adopt it, the demand and utility of Bitcoins are likely to increase. Governments around the world have been developing regulations for cryptocurrencies. The regulatory environment could shape Bitcoin's future by either fostering its growth or imposing restrictions that might affect its popularity and usage.\n\nWill Bitcoin gain momentum and rise in 2023?\n\nThe question everybody would like the answer to: will Bitcoin rise in value? The Bitcoin price has seen a remarkable turnaround in the first half of 2023, surging by 55%, possibly signaling the end of the crypto winter. However, the cryptocurrency's price momentum has recently stalled, leaving traders uncertain about its future trajectory. In January 2023, BTC began its turnaround, gaining an impressive 83% by April 10th, reaching a high of $31,035. This milestone also marked a breakthrough above a crucial resistance level at $30,000, albeit briefly. Since April, Bitcoin has been trading sideways and downward, fluctuating between support at $27,000 and resistance at $30,000. The coin experienced consecutive lower lows, with occasional breaks below the support level.\n\nAt the start of the year, 2023 seemed like a potential breakout year for Bitcoin prices, with its 83% growth in just four months attracting investors seeking an inflation-proof asset similar to gold, given the continued high inflation. However, Bitcoin's momentum waned due to cooling inflation and higher interest rates, prompting investors to shift from holding BTC to holding treasury bills. Moreover, increased regulatory scrutiny of the crypto market spooked many institutional investors, leading to reductions in their digital asset holdings.\n\nPresently, Bitcoin's Fear and Greed Index stands at 44, reflecting fear in the market, a significant change from a month ago when it indicated greed at an index of 66. This index considers various factors such as volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment and search trends. The negative news surrounding Bitcoins has manifested in its price action, with the coin struggling to maintain a break above the key $30,000 resistance level and instead trending downward, repeatedly testing support at $27,000. For more information, everything you need to know about bitcoin can be found here.\n\nCan the Bitcoin price reach $100,000 by 2023?\n\nBitcoin has experienced a remarkable rally of over 80% since the beginning of the year, surpassing many other major assets and delivering substantial returns to those who bought during dips. For Bitcoin to achieve this magical milestone, it would need to show an upside of 270%, reaching the level of $100,000 from its current value. Considering the BTC price chart, potential support levels are identified at $25,175, $21,525, and $18,650. While Bitcoin's slide may temporarily pause around the $25,175 level, this weak support is unlikely to hold in the long term. The $21,525 support appears to be more robust and could potentially serve as a stable price point for Bitcoins. In a worst-case scenario for Bitcoin investors, the coin might test its support at $18,650 or even revisit its 2022 low of $15,760.\n\nCan the Bitcoin orice reach $1,000,000 by 2025?\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts often have ambitious and sometimes seemingly impossible predictions for the cryptocurrency. Following this recent mini-bull run, discussions have emerged suggesting that BTC could potentially reach a level of $1 million by the year 2025. This hypothetical figure of $1 million has been echoed by several prominent figures in the crypto space. For that to happen, the world would have to experience a hyperinflation, which would weaken the value of the dollar, leading people to turn to Bitcoin as a hedge against currency depreciation. Some crypto experts believe that while it can reach $1 million in the coming years, they find it unlikely to happen so soon, such as in 2023 or within 90 days. Others suggest that such an extreme prediction might take around 10 years to materialize, if at all. As with any speculation regarding Bitcoin's future price, it's important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly unpredictable, and multiple factors can influence its value over time.\n\nOr, will we see a Bitcoin crash in 2023?\n\nWhile some investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin's future, there is another group of investors, corporates, and large institutions who hold a contrasting view and firmly believe that Bitcoins might face a decline in the near future. They perceive the recent rally as a \"bull trap\" rather than a genuine \"bull run.\" Experts argue that the backdrop of rising interest rates and tighter monetary policy may hinder Bitcoin's sharp rebound in the near future. In such uncertain markets, investors may be less inclined to invest in or buy risky assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, some long-term BTC holders might choose to sell their positions, leading to additional downward pressure on the markets.\n\nWhat is the worst case scenario for Bitcoin?\n\nOn the bearish side of the Bitcoin argument, there are investors who firmly believe that digital currencies, including Bitcoin, are fundamentally worthless. It's important to note that this worst-case scenario is pessimistic, just as the best-case scenario is overly optimistic. The likelihood of these doom-and-gloom factors materializing is slim, just as the chances of all the pieces aligning perfectly for a Bitcoin utopia are improbable. As with any investment, especially one as volatile and unpredictable as Bitcoin, it's crucial to be aware of potential risks.\n\nThose holding this viewpoint expect the Bitcoin token to eventually lose all of its value, and this could happen in several ways:\n\nGlobal government ban\n\nGovernments worldwide unite against Bitcoin transactions, leading to its effective reduction in value to $0.00. If the digital coin becomes inaccessible for usage, trading, or ownership, it would lose all worth.\n\nMade obsolete by a new, better technology\n\nA new digital currency with superior technology could emerge, rendering Bitcoin mining obsolete overnight. The introduction of a more advanced solution offering tighter security, faster transactions, enhanced privacy protections or even lower energy consumption could deal a significant blow to Bitcoin's value.\n\nCatastrophic technical error\n\nA major flaw in Bitcoin's underlying technology could be discovered, compromising the network's security. For instance, if the transaction system is found to be vulnerable to attacks by quantum computers, it could severely impact investor trust, leading to a sharp price drop.\n\nEnvironmental impact \u2013 Bitcoin's massive energy consumption\n\nContinued rise in Bitcoin's energy consumption may draw increased criticism and potential regulatory restrictions due to environmental concerns. This could result in a loss of market trust and value for Bitcoin mining.\n\nA more realistic scenario for Bitcoin\n\nThe outlook for the Bitcoin network, taking a more practical and realistic approach, acknowledges the speculative nature of previous utopian and dystopian reviews. It recognizes that cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, will experience both positive and negative developments in the coming years. While the potential for reshaping global financial markets is evident, the path forward is expected to be challenging and unpredictable.\n\nThe following are the key points in this middle-road perspective:\n\nRegulation uncertainty\n\nGovernments worldwide will continue to grapple with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, leading to a tug-of-war between acceptance and restrictions. This regulatory uncertainty may cause periods of extreme market volatility as the industry responds to regulatory news.\n\nIncreased usage over time\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to see increased adoption by businesses and consumers, but the process will be gradual. Some entities may remain hesitant due to concerns about volatility, transaction costs, and regulatory issues. However, the overall trend toward greater acceptance of cryptocurrencies is expected to persist.\n\nMany competing cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin will face stiff competition from other cryptocurrencies that offer various advantages, such as faster transaction speeds, lower fees and improved privacy features. While Bitcoin remains the dominant player, its long-term position is not guaranteed, and rival cryptocurrencies may challenge its prominence.\n\nTechnical improvements in Bitcoin\n\nThe Bitcoin network will likely undergo further enhancements, although these improvements may be gradual and subject to controversy. Implementing changes to the Bitcoin protocol requires consensus among miners and node operators, making major upgrades challenging to achieve. For instance, the shift from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake validation, like Ethereum did, raises questions about Bitcoin's maximum coin cap and potential vulnerabilities to competitors.\n\nContinued high Bitcoin volatility\n\nBitcoin's price is expected to remain volatile, with significant price swings being a norm rather than an exception. As the market matures, this volatility may decrease, but in the meantime, expect roller-coaster fluctuations.\n\nConclusion\n\nVarious perspectives and forecasts about the Bitcoin network abound, ranging from bullish to bearish. The future direction of Bitcoin remains uncertain and can only be determined with the passage of time. Notably, Bitcoin has earned a reputation for its ability to bounce back from challenges. Despite long-standing predictions of an impending burst in the Bitcoin bubble by seasoned experts over the last decade, the cryptocurrency continues to be highly regarded and has proven instrumental in generating significant wealth for many investors.\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is being provided solely for promotional and informational purposes and should not be construed as investment, tax or legal advice."

        "content": "September is well-known as a negative month for Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price performance, having only shown monthly gains in September 2015 and 2016. For all other years, the coming month was marked as historically favorable for the \u2018bears\u2019, instead of the \u2018bulls\u2019.\n\nHistorical data retrieved by Finbold from Coinglass shows Bitcoin\u2019s price performance in September for each year since 2013:\n\n2013: -1.76%\n\n2014: -19.01%\n\n2015: +2.35%\n\n2016: +6.04%\n\n2017: -7.44%\n\n2018: -5.58%\n\n2019: -13.38%\n\n2020: -7.51%\n\n2021: -7.03%\n\n2022: -3.12%\n\nBitcoin Monthly returns (%) from 2013 to 2023. Source: Coinglass\n\nNow, the market is trying to figure out what to expect for 2023\u2019s September, considering that BTC had close to two years of a \u2018bear market\u2019, and positive expectations for a coming \u2018bull market\u2019 are growing as the Bitcoin halving approaches for 2024.\n\nHow will Bitcoin perform in September 2023?\n\nInterestingly, the only two years that September was a positive month for Bitcoin, were low-volume years of price consolidation for the leading cryptocurrency, also following two negative months for BTC in August.\n\nAlthough interesting, there are no patterns in \u2018price consolidation years with losing Augusts, equals to September gains\u2019. 2014 was also a year with low volatility when Bitcoin showed losses of -17.55% in August and was the worst year for September\u2019s BTC, with a -19% red 1-month candlestick.\n\nSomething similar happened in 2019, as for a price consolidation year, with a negative August for Bitcoin, followed by the second worst year for September\u2019s BTC, registering losses of over 13%.\n\nWith a lack of historical patterns, most price predictions using this inconclusive data are highly speculative, presenting a high risk for decision-making. Investors must understand all other factors that worked to determine BTC\u2019s results for each month in each different year.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is consolidating at $26,045 (+0.37%) by press time, with a 24-hour volume lower than 3% of BTC\u2019s market cap, with a $12 billion exchanging volume out of a $506 billion market capitalization. Marking a period of extremely low liquidity for all cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the time of publication, August is a losing month for Bitcoin, with around 11% in losses.\n\nThe price-performance for the leading digital asset in both August and September will depend on further developments related to Bitcoin, as well as the general sentiment on the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Do You Go for USD 20,000 or USD 30,000? - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we analyze the situation of Bitcoin and see what the technical indicators are signaling about the future price of BTC in USD.\n\nAfter the latest dump that led BTC to register -7% in a single day, the outlook for the king of the crypto market seems to be less than reassuring.\n\nHowever, some data tell us that uncertainty still reigns in the air and there are still chances for a bullish rally.\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together.\n\nBitcoin price analysis: two downside factors for the crypto price in USD\n\nLast Thursday, Bitcoin recorded one of the largest daily declines of the entire 2023, losing 7.33% in 24 hours and seeing $2,100 evaporate from its price.\n\nAt the moment, the king of the crypto market scores around $26,000, with some technical indicators signaling the high probability of new declines to come.\n\nOf these, the most iconic and also the most fundamental is that of the 200-day moving average, which shows us that Bitcoin has closed below it for the first time in more than five months.\n\nUsually the upward or downward break of this indicator serves as a strong signal for the crypto\u2019s future price action.\n\nThe last time we witnessed BTC close below the 200 daily SMA, in December 2021, there were several weeks of dumps, with the average acting as resistance for brief bullish moves.\n\nHowever, when the indicator was broken to the upside with a daily close above 20,000 in January 2023, the bulls took over until July.\n\nLooking at the current situation, unless BTC quickly regains the lost ground by establishing the last movement as a \u201cfake,\u201d we can easily imagine new declines for the crypto asset\u2019s price.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily chart of the price of Bitcoin (BTC/USDT)\n\nOn the derivatives market front, the indicators are no more positive than before.\n\nOn 17 August, the day of Bitcoin\u2019s big dump, more than $386 million in long positions were liquidated among the futures trading venues of the Binance, Bybit, Okx, Huobi, BitMex, Deribit, CoinEX, and Bitfinex exchanges.\n\nIf we take as reference not only BTC but all other cryptocurrencies we can observe liquidations of about $1 billion, higher even than those recorded during the collapse of FTX in November 2022.\n\nBitcoin just saw one of its largest daily liquidations by volume in history.\n\n\n\nStarting at 4:30 PM yesterday, #Bitcoin fell 7.5% in 20 MINUTES, erasing $42 billion in market cap.\n\n\n\nThis mass-liquidation event involved more outflows in 1 day than during the FTX collapse in November\u2026 pic.twitter.com/KmVNkXoOLw \u2014 The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 18, 2023\n\nOpen interest in digital gold has definitely shrunk since the last price slide, with the metric briefly falling from $10.53 billion to $8.38 billion, a difference of more than $2 billion in aggregate value.\n\nThis basically means that a lot of interest in managing highly speculative positions has waned after the latest burn taken by traders, who are most likely considering less risky investments.\n\nAlso very interesting to note is how since May 2022 the 10.5-11 billion open interest has acted as resistance for much of Bitcoin\u2019s bullish excursions, which was promptly pushed back to those levels resulting in subsequent declines in the metric.\n\nAt the same time, the 6.5 billion level proved to be good support for prices, which began to rise each time the value was touched.\n\nEven on the last occasion, after the BTC dump, the open interest was rejected strongly to the current $7.9 billion.\n\nSince there is still room, we will most likely see Bitcoin fall in price for the next few weeks with a parallel decline in the total value of open positions in derivative markets.\n\nThe trend should sooner or later mark an upward break.\n\nThe time frame, however, may still be very long before this happens.\n\n\n\nOpen interest chart on Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n\n\nA look at the dominance of the king of the market and on-chain data\n\nDespite the very delicate situation for Bitcoin, there is also some data that signal a positive environment for future prices of the cryptocurrency, which could likely remain below $25,000 until the end of 2023.\n\nFirst, BTC dominance moved in an unusual way during last week\u2019s price drop: usually when there are dumps of this type dominance tends to rise strongly.\n\nThis time we observed the exact opposite with the indicator losing 1% in a short time.\n\nThis means that altcoins have withstood the shock and that many investors are confident about movements in the coming months and have preferred to hold their positions.\n\nSupporting this argument is also the matter of market volumes: even though the liquidations in the crypto markets were comparable to what happened during the FTX crash, we cannot say the same about the capital moved in these trials, which were about 7 times lower.\n\nWhen the real money inflows arrive within the market, we may be able to decree with \u201ccertainty\u201d the future direction of BTC prices.\n\n\n\nDaily chart dominance Bitcoin (BTC)\n\n\n\nAnother positive factor for Bitcoin concerns a piece of on-chain data, namely that of the 7-day average of the network hash rate.\n\nIn fact, a few days ago we witnessed a new all-time high for this metric, which presents us with a positive context in the world of miners, who are increasingly increasing their share of computing power.\n\nThe more hashrate there is, the greater the security and stability of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nMoreover, a growth of this figure can be interpreted with a constant interest by certain players to grab a share of the network\u2019s power, aware that this could bring excellent profits in the future.\n\nMoreover, this morning the sum of all holders owning more than 1 BTC reached a new ATH according to Glassnode\u2019s data, reaching a total of 1,015,299 addresses.\n\nThis figure, like the previous one regarding the hash rate, is also illustrating a situation that is far from negative for the virtual currency, in which real smart money is accumulating market share ahead of the next bull run without taking current dollar prices into too much consideration.\n\nIf you are a true Bitcoiner, what matters at the end of all is not the profits and losses you are recording, but the amount of coins you possess within your wallets.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 #Bitcoin $BTC Number of Addresses Holding 1+ Coins just reached an ATH of 1,015,299\n\n\n\nPrevious ATH of 1,015,241 was observed on 20 August 2023\n\n\n\nView metric:https://t.co/s7tx1xxyz3 pic.twitter.com/DsYGzzLEhV \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 21, 2023\n\nBitcoin price: are we more likely to see $20,000 or $30,000 first?\n\nAfter analyzing the previous technical and on-chain indicators, we can try to draw conclusions about Bitcoin\u2019s overall situation on the future price front.\n\nThe question of whether we will see $20,000 or $30,000 first is not easy to give a definite answer.\n\nHowever, we can conclude on the fact that we will probably observe more declines in the short term.\n\nIn any case, we could easily hold well above $20,000, where there is a strong support area that converges near the January pump, where volumes and liquidity were far greater than current values.\n\nIndicatively, given the performance of the crypto markets as a whole, we can say that even on the other side of the coin we won\u2019t be seeing so easily $30,000 as the short-term price for Bitcoin.\n\nWhat seems more feasible is that until the end of the year, prices will fluctuate between the two extremes, never breaking up or down unless very important events occur.\n\nTo stay on track, it will be important to monitor developments in the Chinese markets, where after the collapse of Evergrande there could be other cascading defaults, as well as the upcoming decisions of the US Federal Reserve regarding interest rates on government bonds.\n\nUntil the end of 2023 we should not expect major gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but from 2024 onward we can finally smile again as we did in 2021."

        "content": "In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, the relative strength index (RSI) serves as a valuable tool for investors and traders to gauge the momentum of an asset. A recent development has set the stage for a significant market event, as the Bitcoin (BTC) daily RSI has plummeted to levels not seen since the COVID-19-induced crash in March 2020.\n\nRSI, a widely used technical indicator, measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings above 70 typically indicating an overbought condition and readings below 30 suggesting an oversold condition.\n\nThe recent drop in Bitcoin\u2019s daily RSI below the 20-mark has raised eyebrows in the cryptocurrency community. This level of oversold territory hasn\u2019t been witnessed since the turbulent days of the pandemic-induced market crash in March 2020, when the entire financial landscape was gripped by fear and uncertainty.\n\n#Bitcoin Daily RSI is now the most oversold since the Covid Crash in March 2020. pic.twitter.com/OULTwMFl2A \u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) August 21, 2023\n\nMarket analysts and enthusiasts are now closely watching this RSI movement as it could signal a potential turning point in Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory. Historically, extreme oversold conditions have often preceded significant price rebounds, leading to speculative discussions about the possibility of a bullish reversal in the coming weeks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s essential to approach these indicators with caution. While oversold RSI levels can offer insights into potential price reversals, they are not foolproof predictors. Cryptocurrency markets are notorious for their unpredictability, and a multitude of factors, both macroeconomic and technological, can influence their direction.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is changing hands at the price of $26,013, representing a decline of 0.34% on the day, an 11.53% loss over the past week, as per the data retrieved on August 21.\n\nElsewhere, renowned cryptocurrency analyst Michael van de Poppe has turned the spotlight onto Bitcoin dominance, pointing out a trend that could reshape the landscape of the digital currency market. According to Poppe\u2019s observations, Bitcoin dominance has been on a steady decline, raising the possibility of a noteworthy altcoin rally.\n\nPoppe\u2019s analysis focuses on the technical aspect of Bitcoin dominance. He highlights that Bitcoin dominance recently tested the significant 200-week moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA). Following this test, the dominance percentage has experienced a downward trajectory, indicating a potential shift in market dynamics.\n\nMVP 200-week MA and EMA. Source: Michael van de Poppe\n\nThis downward trajectory, as outlined by Poppe, could persist over the forthcoming months. Such a trend implies that alternative cryptocurrencies, often referred to as \u201caltcoins,\u201d might outperform Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation and market capitalization growth. This phenomenon could signal a broader diversification in the cryptocurrency market as investors seek to explore other promising projects beyond the dominant Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Poppe acknowledges a crucial caveat in his analysis. He suggests that his thesis of altcoins outperforming Bitcoin would be invalidated if Bitcoin reclaims the 200-week MA and EMA. This scenario would likely lead to a resurgence in Bitcoin dominance, potentially stifling the anticipated altcoin rally.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
