        "title": "Cryptocurrency investors eagerly awaiting SEC ruling on bitcoin ETFs - CNBC",
        "content": "Crypto investors are eagerly awaiting an imminent ruling from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that will likely approve the trading of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, more than a decade after initial attempts were rejected.\n\n13 companies have filed for a spot bitcoin ETF:\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nArk/21Shares Bitcoin Trust\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust\n\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF Trust\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust\n\nGlobal X Bitcoin Trust\n\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF\n\nFranklin Templeton Digital Holdings Trust\n\nPando Asset Spot Bitcoin Trust\n\nHow the SEC will proceed\n\nThere are two components to the applications:\n\n1) A 19b-4 filing, which is a form used by exchanges to inform the SEC of a proposed rule change. In this case, a rule change is required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 because a spot bitcoin ETF is a new product, and the exchanges \u2014 NYSE, Nasdaq and Cboe \u2014 must provide rules to explain how the product will trade. The SEC must approve the rule changes before the product can trade. This is the filing that is facing a deadline of Jan. 10 for the Ark/21Shares Bitcoin Trust.\n\n2) Approval of S-1. This is a filing to register a new security with the SEC, in a document that provides information about the specific security. In this case, each company filing for the spot bitcoin ETF has differences in the way the product might be structured. In the case of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, an S-3 filing must be approved, which is a simplified security registration form for businesses that have met other reporting requirements.\n\nIt's widely anticipated that once the 19b-4 filings are approved, the SEC will separately approve the S-1 applications of all the ETF applicants at once. However, because the applications are different, that is not a slam dunk. The SEC may decide to approve some, but not all, of the S-1s.\n\nWide spread in fee\n\nWith 13 companies filing for a bitcoin ETF, all of which are similar products, there is substantial interest in what the fee structure will look like.\n\nFidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund has announced it will charge 39 basis points, or 0.39%. Invesco's Galaxy Bitcoin ETF has set its expense ratio at 59 basis points, which are waived for the initial six months and the first $5 billion in assets. Ark/21Shares and Valkyrie will charge 80 basis points.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust currently charges 2% but has said it's committed to lowering the fee once its application to convert to a bitcoin ETF is approved.\n\nOther applicants have not yet announced their fee structure.\n\nIt is unclear who the main regulator of the crypto industry is\n\nAll this happens against the backdrop of SEC Chair Gary Gensler's long-running fight with the crypto industry.\n\nGensler has fought several court battles against major crypto players, including a losing battle against Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which won a case against the SEC last summer. In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the SEC had already approved a futures-based bitcoin product and that it failed to explain why it had refused to approve a spot-bitcoin product. The court said, in essence, the futures and the spot market are \"like\" products. If the SEC approved one, it logically had to approve the other.\n\nBitcoin has been ruled to be a commodity, but with the exception of ether, there are no such rulings on other cryptocurrencies. In the absence of clear federal rules, the SEC has taken to regulation by enforcement to demonstrate that many cryptocurrencies are securities, and it therefore has regulatory authority over much of the crypto industry.\n\nThere is an outstanding case against Coinbase , the largest U.S. crypto exchange, where the SEC alleges that the company violated rules requiring it to register as an exchange. In that case, the SEC has alleged that some of the crypto assets traded on Coinbase are securities and fall under the SEC's purview.\n\nThe SEC sued Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao last June, alleging that Binance and Zhao \"engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law,\" according to Gensler.\n\nThe case is ongoing, but in November, the U.S. Department of Justice settled different charges against Binance and Zhao, wherein Zhao pleaded guilty to money laundering violations and agreed to pay a $50 million fine and step down from his role as the company's chief executive. Binance also accepted the appointment of a government monitor to oversee the business.\n\nARK Invest's Cathie Wood will be our guest on \"Halftime Report\" at 12:35 p.m. Monday, and on \"ETF Edge\" on Monday at 1:10 p.m.-1:30 p.m. ET on ETFEdge.cnbc.com."

        "title": "Unpacking the bitcoin ETF frenzy - Axios",
        "content": "The headline from Fortune's Jeff John Roberts says it all: \"The crypto world is losing its mind over when bitcoin ETFs will arrive.\" Why it matters: Pretty much every major price increase in bitcoin in recent months has been chalked up to anticipation that the long-awaited day will soon arrive when investors will be able to buy funds directly tied to the spot price of the OG cryptocurrency.\n\nBy the numbers: Bitcoin is up 162% over the past year, and currently trades at about $45,000 per coin. It was worth less than $30,000 as recently as October.\n\nThe big picture: It's not immediately obvious why the arrival of bitcoin ETFs would cause a huge spike in demand for bitcoin.\n\nThere are already lots of ways of getting exposure to bitcoin on the stock market, if you want it, from closed-end funds owning bitcoin (GBTC) to ETFs tracking bitcoin futures (XBTF) to companies that are mostly just piles of bitcoin (MicroStrategy) to companies that are plays on the future of crypto more broadly (Coinbase).\n\nInstitutional and retail investors alike have many ways to buy bitcoin directly if they want to do so, and to hold it with trustworthy custodians.\n\nRetail investors also don't generally get sent 1099 forms on their crypto trading profits, and as a result often don't report those profits on their tax returns. Any trading profits in a bitcoin ETF, by contrast, will be fully taxed.\n\nThe other side: In between institutional and retail sit a huge mass of private bankers, investment advisors, and wealth managers, including roboadvisors.\n\nMost of these outfits \u2014 who in aggregate control trillions of dollars in private wealth \u2014 might be perfectly happy allocating a small percentage of a client's portfolio to bitcoin in theory, but don't want to deal with a whole new layer of custodianship and reporting. A simple-to-understand ETF would make buying bitcoin a lot easier, and therefore more common.\n\nIntriguingly, while the bitcoin world broadly considers bitcoin ETFs to be just around the corner, only 39% of advisors believe such a thing will be approved this year.\n\nAt the moment, only 19% of them are allowed to buy bitcoin for client accounts.\n\nThe bottom line: Bitcoin ETFs will have to rapidly accumulate a lot of assets in order to justify the kind of price appreciation we've seen over the past year. Then again, bitcoin is an asset without any real fundamentals, which means its price can \u2014 and does \u2014 go just about anywhere."

        "title": "Bitcoin: four reasons why the price should surge in 2024 - The Conversation Indonesia",
        "content": "The year 2023 will be remembered as turbulent for cryptocurrencies, with numerous important developments that ultimately helped to \u201cclean up\u201d the space to potentially make it more attractive to mainstream investors. Notably there was the conviction of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for fraud.\n\nTop exchange Binance also reached a US$4 billion settlement (\u00a33.1 billion) with the US treasury department over money-laundering charges, which saw CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao agreeing to step down and pay a US$50 million fine.\n\nMeanwhile, regulators continued cracking down on other operators, but potentially lost one of their key cases against the industry after a US court ruled that the XRP token, one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, was not a security (meaning a tradeable financial asset like shares or bonds).\n\nThis means its creator, Ripple, did not break the law by selling it on exchanges. Viewed as a test case for the majority of cryptocurrencies, the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently appealing.\n\nWhile all this was happening, the bitcoin price rose away from the lows of late 2022. It started the year at US$16,000 and ended comfortably above the US$40,000 threshold.\n\nSo what does 2024 look like for this sector and what key events are on the horizon?\n\n1. ETFs\n\nThe SEC may finally be about to greenlight a type of investment vehicle known as an exchange traded fund (ETF) for the general or \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin market. ETFs already exist for everything from oil to the FTSE 100 to even regions and countries. They track the underlying asset, creating an easy way for people to invest without having to buy the asset directly.\n\nUntil now, the only ETFs permitted for crypto in the US have been for the futures markets. These niche markets are concerned with where investors think crypto prices are heading in future.\n\nBitcoin price 2021-24\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would likely encourage mainstream investors to buy exposure to this market, while potentially attracting banks to actively participate too. Bitcoin could be offered by financial advisors and there would no longer be a need for investors to hold the asset itself or face difficulties like crypto exchanges, coin storage and so on.\n\nThere are various reasons why many commentators think the SEC may now end its opposition to such an ETF. For one thing, the list of applicants includes Blackrock, the biggest investment house in the world, along with various other major players.\n\nAlso, digital asset group Grayscale won an important case against the SEC in 2023, which had been blocking its attempt to convert its US$17 billion bitcoin futures ETF, GBTC, into a spot version. This has forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s application too.\n\nFurther, Hong Kong\u2019s regulatory authority has announced it is open to spot bitcoin ETF applications and has laid down guidelines permitting several varieties. As well as the basic model that we may soon see in the US, where investors would buy into bitcoin ETFs with dollars, Hong Kong is open to a second variety known as \u201cin-kind\u201d.\n\nThis would make it possible to convert shares in a bitcoin ETF into bitcoin and vice versa, allowing more flexibility and potentially attracting more institutional investors into the space.\n\n2. Interest rates\n\nJerome Powell, chair of US central bank the Federal Reserve, has indicated that interest rates may have peaked, and that the Fed is likely to cut them during 2024. Similarly in the UK, leading mortgage lender Halifax has cut its lending rate in expectation of a Bank of England rate cut.\n\nIf interest rates are cut or even stabilise in 2024, it could make bitcoin (and other digital assets) more attractive to investors, since its limited supply makes it a hedge against traditional currencies losing value over time.\n\nMore generally, rate cuts prompt investors to look for higher investment returns, and cryptocurrencies have delivered here too.\n\nAsset class returns since 2011\n\nIn addition, the US and other economies may enter a recession in the later half of 2024 due to the lagged effects of the interest rate hikes.\n\nEqually, we saw a number of bank failures in 2023, predominantly in the US. In the event of a recession or more bank problems, governments may be forced to provide stimulus packages and print more money. This would further devalue currencies and make bitcoin still more attractive.\n\n3. The halving\n\nA big event for bitcoin in 2024 is the so-called \u201chalving\u201d. Bitcoin runs on an online ledger known as a blockchain, in which entries are validated by \u201cminers\u201d using arrays of computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Miners are paid in bitcoin for completing a set of transactions known as a block, and the protocol stipulates that their reward per block halves every 210,000 \u201cblocks\u201d (roughly every four years).\n\nThe reward began at 50 bitcoin in 2009 and is expected to fall from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin around the middle of April 2024.\n\nThis decrease entails fewer bitcoin sold on the market, which tightens supply and may squeeze out the least efficient miners, significantly reducing the computer power used by the network. The three previous halvings have prompted dramatic bull runs, while also driving up the prices of digital assets more generally as investors take more risks in the space.\n\nHalving effects\n\n4. Blockchain developments\n\nThe bitcoin network saw a number of technological advancements in 2023. This has included enabling a new and a unique form of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) known as ordinals, and also a new standard called BRC-20 that makes it possible to create new cryptocurrencies on the network. Until now, NFTs and new cryptocurrencies have mostly been issued on other blockchains such as ethereum.\n\nWe are also seeing growing adoption of the Lightning network, a layer above the bitcoin blockchain that enables much faster transactions. All these changes are resulting in increased demand for bitcoin, which in turn may lead to higher prices.\n\nIn sum, there\u2019s a strong case for being bullish about bitcoin\u2019s price in the year ahead. Commentators\u2019 predictions range from US$60,000 to US$500,000 by year end. Our own belief is that though the road may be bumpy, 2024 could well see increased adoption of cryptocurrencies, which will drive prices beyond the current US$40,000 mark."

        "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014Dennis M. Kelleher, Co-Founder, President, and CEO, issued the following statement on the filing of Better Markets\u2019 Supplemental Comment Letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in response to multiple proposed rule changes filed by national securities exchanges seeking to list and trade shares in spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs).\n\n\u201cThe approval of spot bitcoin ETPs would be a historic mistake almost certainly leading to massive investor harm. The immense and unrelenting fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin market means that approving these products would expose millions of American investors and retirees to the very harms that the SEC exists to prevent. It would also undoubtedly lead the crypto industry to claim or imply that their products are now approved by the United States government. The crypto industry will almost certainly flood Americans with marketing propaganda suggesting that the SEC\u2019s action legitimized crypto, giving false comfort to retail investors. The SEC must not facilitate the financial carnage that will follow if the crypto industry is allowed to repackage, add a veneer of legitimacy to, and widely disseminate a financial product that is little more than a socially worthless gambling chip.\n\n\u201cDenying the proposed rule changes is required under the law. The statute clearly provides that the rules of an exchange must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and protect investors and the public interest. The potential for fraud and manipulation in the spot bitcoin market is so great that an exchange cannot permit the listing and trading of a spot bitcoin ETP and still comply with those requirements. Moreover, the surveillance-sharing agreements proposed by the exchanges amount to window-dressing that cannot adequately detect or address the rampant fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin market.\n\n\u201cAs a result, it would be a profound legal error and a policy travesty for the SEC to approve the proposed rule changes. It would expose countless hardworking Americans to the risks inherent in investing in bitcoin. Those risks have not only been obvious over the last three years but have materialized repeatedly, resulting in billions of dollars of losses. The fact that the investment vehicle will be an ETP will not protect investors; if anything, the supposed protections related to the ETP will also provide false comfort to unsuspecting investors who fall for marketers\u2019 claims that the SEC has approved if not endorsed the product. The value of their investment will be subject to the same risks of fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin market as investors who hold bitcoin directly. The SEC must not subject investors to these risks.\u201d\n\nYou can find the full comment letter here.\n\n###\n\nBetter Markets is a non-profit, non-partisan, and independent organization founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to promote the public interest in the financial markets, support the financial reform of Wall Street and make our financial system work for all Americans again.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe writer is a former investment banker and author of \u2018Power Failure: The Rise and Fall of an American Icon\u2019\n\nThe cryptoworld has been abuzz in recent weeks about the likelihood that the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon greenlight a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe idea that such an ETF will soon be offered to hungry, if misguided, US investors has helped provide a year-end kicker to the remarkable rally in bitcoin from the depths of its latest \u201cwinter\u201d in late 2022. It became one of the best performing investments of 2023, rising around 160 per cent over the past year to nearly $44,000.\n\nThat is quite a turnaround given the crypto world has been on the ropes reputationally often during the past year or so. Not only has there been the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX and the criminal conviction of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, but also its chief rival Binance agreeing to pay $4.3bn in penalties related to money laundering and breaching international sanctions. That was one of the largest corporate penalties in US history. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao also pleaded guilty to failing to protect against money laundering and resigned from his position.\n\nBut if you think about it, there has already been a way for investors to play the bitcoin rollercoaster for years: by buying, or selling, the stock of enterprise software company MicroStrategy which has hitched its fortunes to bitcoin, rendering its sales of enterprise software somewhat irrelevant to its stock market valuation.\n\nUnder a strategy driven by the company\u2019s 58-year-old, MIT-educated executive chair Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has been buying bitcoin since 2020. \u201cDue to its limited supply, bitcoin offers the opportunity for appreciation in value if its adoption increases and has the potential to serve as a hedge against inflation in the long term,\u201d it said at the time. MicroStrategy is thought to be the largest listed holder of bitcoin in the world. The company owns 189,150 bitcoins, purchased over the years at an aggregate price of around $5.9bn, as of the end of December.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s software operations have brought Saylor into the regulatory spotlight. In 2000, he agreed to pay $8.3mn plus a $350,000 penalty to settle SEC charges of materially overstating software revenues and earnings. But when bitcoin was riding high, say around November 2021, when its price hit $69,000, he drew a lot of attention. He even bedazzled Tucker Carlson for more than an hour about the wisdom of the cryptocurrency before the television anchor was defenestrated from Fox.\n\nSaylor is a true believer, and an articulate one at that. His interviews about bitcoin are lengthy and spellbinding. He speaks in complete paragraphs. You come away from listening to him convinced that bitcoin is the next great innovation in the financial world. And then, you step back, give it a thought or two and remember that Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, said of cryptocurrency, \u201cIf I was the government, I\u2019d shut it down.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy executive chair Michael Saylor: \u2018We\u2019re kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF\u2019 \u00a9 Bloomberg\n\nSaylor relinquished the role of the CEO of MicroStrategy in August 2022 to become executive chair after yet another bitcoin plunge. At the time, the company had reported cumulative impairment losses of nearly $2bn on its digital assets since acquisition.\n\nBut thanks to the run-up in the price of bitcoin in 2023, MicroStrategy\u2019s hoard is now worth more than $8bn, giving the company a gain of some $2bn on its investment. Not surprisingly, MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price also outperformed in 2023, up more than 330 per cent for the year. Its market value of around $8.8bn means that investors are valuing its software business at around $800mn. (That is still hefty given MicroStrategy made a small pre-tax profit of around \u00a313mn on revenues of $371mn in the nine months to September 30, after taking into account share-based pay but excluding impairments on its digital holdings.)\n\nSo MicroStrategy is essentially a play on bitcoin and has been for years. In other words, there\u2019s been no need to wait for the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF, it seems to me. Saylor himself told CNBC: \u201cWe\u2019re kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF.\u201d\n\nThe problem with bitcoin isn\u2019t that there hasn\u2019t been a way to speculate on it. The problem with bitcoin is that it\u2019s all about speculation. We don\u2019t need new ways to speculate on the cryptocurrency. What we need, if bitcoin is going to be the saviour its advocates want us to think it is, is a use for bitcoin.\n\nWhen it can be used to buy and sell the things we want, as seamlessly as fiat currency, that\u2019ll be the game changer. The real excitement for bitcoin won\u2019t come from the SEC authorising new ways to speculate on it, but rather when there\u2019s more to it than just speculation.\n\nThis article has been amended to correct the year in which MicroStrategy started buying bitcoin to 2020."

Nakamoto also likely mined a high number of other blocks in the network\u2019s early days but it\u2019s unclear exactly how many.\n\nWhile theoretically, Nakamoto could still be holding onto their private keys to access these wallets and could move or return the funds, the general consensus is that this would be unlikely to happen. This is because funds from wallets associated with Nakamoto, including funds held in the Genesis block, have not moved since Nakamoto\u2019s disappearance in Dec. 2010.\n\nWhen Nakamoto disappeared, the Genesis wallet only contained the 50 bitcoin that was mined when it was created. Over time, more funds were sent to the wallet and its balance rose to 72 bitcoin in late 2023. With the latest transaction, the current balance is now 99.67 bitcoin, worth $4.3 million.\n\nThis is a drop in the bucket for Nakamoto though. Estimates are that they control as much as 1.1 million bitcoin, currently worth $47 billion \u2014 on paper, that is."

        "content": "After a solid 2023, cryptocurrencies have started this year on a high. Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most prominent cryptocurrency, has particularly been on a dream run over the past couple of months and the rally is set to gain pace in the coming months as multiple positive developments have given investors\u2019 sentiment a boost.\n\nBitcoin rallied past $43,000 in December 2023, and on Jan 2, it surged past the $45,000 mark for the first time since April 2022. Although the cryptocurrency retreated from its 21-month high, it hovered around $44,200 on Jan 4.\n\nOver the past three months, Bitcoin has rallied more than 61%. The Federal Reserve didn\u2019t hike interest rates in its last three FOMC meetings in 2023 after raising interest rates by 525 basis points, as its aggressive monetary tightening campaign has seen inflation decline sharply.\n\nCooling inflation has also raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon end its monetary tightening campaign and start cutting rates this year, which could be as early as in March. Higher interest rates have adverse effects on growth-focused sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso, investors are optimistic about the imminent approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This approval is expected to have a significant positive impact, providing strong support to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nInvestors are currently looking forward to the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC as early as the first half of 2024.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. COIN offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy. COIN provides a main financial account for consumers in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto asset transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications and accept cryptocurrencies securely as payment.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase Global\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 92%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 16.7% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 14.4% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2.

Through PYPL, users can use cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services from online merchants. Additionally, PayPal\u2019s mobile wallet platform, Venmo, also allows users to engage in cryptocurrency buying and selling activities.\n\nPayPal Holdings\u2019 expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 20.6%.

        "title": "2 Major Risks Investors Should Know Before Buying Bitcoin in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's hard not to be bullish on Bitcoin (BTC -9.11%) in 2024. Last year, Bitcoin was up more than 150% and soundly outperformed every major market benchmark. At a recent price of $45,000, Bitcoin was trading at its highest level since April 2022. On top of all that, anticipation is growing over the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and what that might mean for the future price of Bitcoin.\n\nBut that doesn't mean an investment in Bitcoin is without risk. In fact, there might be two major risks investors are overlooking.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe first risk involves the imminent launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market. Over the final months of 2023, this looked like a slam-dunk certainty, with many expecting the SEC to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF in early January. After all, more than a dozen Wall Street firms have submitted ETF applications, and they have been carefully updating and amending these applications as needed.\n\nBut the latest word in the crypto markets is that the SEC might delay any approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF until there is a more comprehensive regulatory framework in place for crypto within the United States. Obviously, this would be devastating news for Bitcoin investors, given that much of the recent run-up in price has been driven by anticipation around approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMoreover, even if the SEC approves a spot Bitcoin ETF, there's still the matter of what will happen to the price of Bitcoin. If you believe in efficient markets, then much of the expected price bump that Bitcoin is expected to get after official approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF may already be priced in. That might be a shock to some investors, who are likely assuming that official SEC approval sometime in January is automatically going to send the price of Bitcoin soaring.\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, the price of Bitcoin might actually decline in the short term. That's due to a well-known market phenomenon called \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\" In short, investors buy ahead of anticipated news of a major event. Then, once the event actually occurs, they sell, in order to take profits. So if you're expecting a major bounce in the price of Bitcoin in early 2024, you might want to readjust your expectations.\n\nThe arrival of institutional investors\n\nThe other risk involves the sudden influx of many new institutional investors into crypto at one time. Right now, everyone is focused on the potential tsunami of new money flooding into Bitcoin, which is almost certain to prop up the price of Bitcoin. The basic thinking here is that these institutional investors will be looking to allocate 1% or more of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Given that the largest of these investors manage trillions of dollars in assets, this could result in billions of dollars eventually flowing into Bitcoin.\n\nBut what's actually going to happen to Bitcoin over the long haul? Remember -- Bitcoin is not just a financial asset, it is also a technological innovation that relies on a vibrant blockchain ecosystem. Crypto executive Arthur Hayes, for example, thinks that the entry of large institutional investors into crypto will \"completely destroy Bitcoin.\" As he points out, the biggest institutional investors are in the \"asset accumulation game,\" and their goal will be to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible.\n\nAs Wall Street goes into asset accumulation mode, it could transform Bitcoin from a dynamic, thriving blockchain with multiple use cases into a lifeless blockchain where nothing interesting ever happens. A large percentage of the world's Bitcoin will essentially be locked up in a vault on Wall Street, doing nothing. In a worst-case scenario, Bitcoin miners will simply stop mining Bitcoin because it is no longer profitable, and Bitcoin as we know it, says Hayes, will simply \"vanish.\" The race will then be on to find the next great cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.\n\nYes, Bitcoin, but which way to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nTo make sense of all this, I've been keeping my eye on what the \"smart money\" is doing ahead of the arrival of the new Bitcoin ETFs. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, appears to be searching for the best investment vehicle for Bitcoin. At year-end, Ark Invest sold shares in Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%), which is viewed as a Bitcoin proxy stock, and also sold shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -5.76%), which is trying to convert into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Ark Invest then bought shares of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO -5.59%), which tracks the performance of Bitcoin using futures contracts (and not spot Bitcoin).\n\nThus, the decision of whether or not to invest in Bitcoin is slightly more nuanced than you might assume. It's up to you as an investor to decide (a) if Bitcoin is right for you and, if so, (b) what the best way to invest in it will be going forward. Heading into 2024, the primary choice is shaping up to be one between spot Bitcoin (Bitcoin bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges) and a spot Bitcoin ETF."

        "content": "Bitcoin hit a peak value of around $68,000 in November 2021. But by November 2022, it had lost more than 75% of that value following the collapse of FTX, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time. And now, it's bounced back up again.\n\nEven with a regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges in the past year, the price of bitcoin rose steadily through most of 2023, and now sits at around $43,610 \u2014 a nearly $18,000 increase in value since September.\n\nOther popular cryptocurrencies have followed a similar trajectory in what has been a remarkable turnaround for an industry battered by scandal. But why now?\n\nInvestors have been buying cryptocurrencies ahead of the much-anticipated approval of the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which is expected later in January.\n\nPending approval, a slew of investment firms are expected to offer ETFs, most notably Blackrock, the largest asset management firm in the world.\n\nAn ETF is an investment fund that tracks the price of an underlying asset or index \u2014 in this case, bitcoin.\n\nThe advantage of a bitcoin or crypto ETF is that it would offer a way for investors to benefit from the price movements of bitcoin without owning the cryptocurrency directly.\n\nIf approved, cryptocurrency ETFs are expected to be traded on traditional SEC-regulated exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, according to CoinDesk.\n\nThat would open up the cryptocurrency market to a wider array of buyers who don't use cryptocurrency exchanges already. In anticipation of ETF approval, investors have been piling back into the market, which has driven up the price of bitcoin.\n\n\"It really opens the door for all kinds of demands. And if demand goes up, price goes up,\" says Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. Boneparth holds investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are other factors at play, too. The Federal Reserve has signaled that its interest rate hike cycle is over, an encouraging sign for the economy as inflation continues to fall. This has made riskier assets like crypto more attractive to investors.\n\nAnother factor is bitcoin's \"halving,\" which is expected in April. Halving is a built-in mechanism related to bitcoin mining that periodically reduces token supply. Decreasing the supply of bitcoin is expected to further stoke demand.\n\nTo break it down, the factors behind the recent surge in bitcoin prices are \"60% bitcoin ETF, 20% halving and 20% economic conditions,\" says Boneparth.\n\nHowever, \"be mindful about the relentless upward [price] movement over the past few months,\" says Owen Lau, executive director at financial services company Oppenheimer & Co. \"A lot of the good news appears to have been priced in.\""

        "content": "Print this page\n\nLet\u2019s begin the year with a bang! By which I mean I\u2019ve decided to allocate some money to a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) if one becomes available soon. Emails to the usual address.\n\nI made up my mind while running along the Exmoor coast last week, steep cliffs plunging into the surf. Many readers will say that\u2019s where my retirement savings will end up. But, as I wrote last summer, it\u2019s time to take more risk.\n\nAnd there is no bigger investment story right now. Google searches for \u201cbitcoin ETF\u201d have tripled over the past week. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency started 2024 by trading 7 per cent higher. Since October add a zero.\n\nThe catalyst is the expectation the Securities and Exchange Commission is about to give the green light to multiple spot applications (you can already buy ETFs holding bitcoin futures contracts). Bloomberg reckons there\u2019s a 90 per cent chance approval will be given by January 10.\n\nThat\u2019s almost as precise as my mate Chris. Before setting off on my jog he told me there was a 98 per cent chance of bitcoin prices doubling this year. Even if he is half right, you don\u2019t need my second-year statistics course at Cambridge to know that\u2019s a nailed-down 50 per cent return.\n\nI would be mad to miss out. And, besides, I\u2019ve changed my view on the suitability of bitcoin ETFs for retail punters. It used to worry me that they seem to fail at least two SEC tests when it comes to investor protection and market integrity. It still does.\n\nTake safe custody. No one can \u201csteal\u201d an ETF, of course, and gangs don\u2019t have a clue where you hide your \u201ccold wallet\u201d \u2014 if you prefer to hold bitcoins offline. The digital wallets ETFs will use are also secure.\n\nBut thieves can raid the biggest and most popular exchanges \u2014 and have done \u2014 undermining prices. Remember that the sole purpose of a spot ETF is to track a price. It therefore doesn\u2019t matter if off-exchange coins are safe.\n\nThe more you think of bitcoin as an investment, whether in an ETF or not, its many flaws don\u2019t differ hugely from most of the other regulated assets you own happily\n\nThe integrity of the whole system can be violated. It\u2019s a bit like being comfortable that your Apple shares are secure with a custodian, even though Gru from Despicable Me can make the retail stores disappear with a ray gun.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs fail another crucial test too: whether the underlying market can be monitored to a sufficient degree to prevent fraud or manipulation. This is mainly why previous SEC applications were rejected.\n\nSure, blockchains are permanent ledgers. But bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and can involve multiple addresses. It\u2019s irrelevant that an ETF is transparent if the assets it holds are not.\n\nIn addition, so-called \u201cwhales\u201d dominate ownership, with 0.25 per cent of addresses holding 80 per cent of total bitcoin supply, according to Bitinfocharts data. Whoever invented bitcoin is thought to own 1.1mn coins.\n\nThat\u2019s roughly a 20th of the total supply to date \u2014 and there are at least five wallets holding around 100,000 coins each, according to Arkham Intel. The scope to move prices, it seems to me, is massive \u2014 and that\u2019s before we even consider fraud.\n\nAll that said, the more you think of bitcoin as an investment, whether in an ETF or not, its many flaws don\u2019t differ hugely from most of the other regulated assets you own happily.\n\nRegarding ownership concentration, bitcoin\u2019s pales beside Bernard Arnault\u2019s 48 per cent stake in LVMH, let alone his majority voting share. Mark Zuckerberg owns 13 per cent of Facebook, as does Elon Musk of Tesla. Those guys move prices each time they blink.\n\nAnother reason people say bitcoin has no place in serious portfolios is because it doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 just ones and zeros with no intrinsic value. But I own plenty of invisible assets in my other funds that are only worth what others are willing to pay for them.\n\nFor companies in my FTSE 100 fund, for example, the tangible book value only accounts for 45 per cent of the total net asset value. In other words, the majority of the ETF doesn\u2019t exist either \u2014 company brand names, goodwill and the like.\n\nThat bitcoin produces no income is also cited as a problem. It is therefore nothing more than a speculative asset. So what? Gold, vintage cars and undeveloped land are the same. By that definition, so is the house or flat you live in.\n\nWhat is more, a fifth of stocks in the S&P 500 did not pay out a dime last year either \u2014 some never do, including Facebook, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon. Finance theory tells us we shouldn\u2019t care about dividends anyway.\n\nThis relates to another concern I don\u2019t share: that bitcoin is therefore impossible to value. You don\u2019t need an income stream to value assets \u2014 ask any art dealer. With the same vertical supply curve as a one-off painting \u2014 19.6mn of the maximum 21mn bitcoins are already circulating \u2014 demand sets prices.\n\nBesides, what isn\u2019t hard to value? Analysts are routinely wrong about every asset class, while the majority of active fund managers underperform. In Europe, for example, more than 90 per cent of active equity funds now trail their benchmarks over a decade, based on S&P Dow Jones data.\n\nFinally, I like the fact that bitcoin\u2019s correlation with the major asset classes is less than 0.25 \u2014 it\u2019s going to be the mad uncle in my portfolio. Sure, it also has an annualised volatility approaching 50 per cent (don\u2019t all relatives?) but as returns are so high, risk/adjusted returns remain attractive.\n\nSo come on SEC, have some fun why don\u2019t you! Or at least be consistent \u2014 there are loads of ways my savings can crash into the sea that you already approve of.\n\nThe author is a former portfolio manager.

        "title": "Coinbase valuation rests on bitcoin ETF approval - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nCoinbase was the financial dark horse of 2023. The crypto trading platform\u2019s near 400 per cent surge in stock price trounced tech peers, exceeding even Nvidia\u2019s 249 per cent gain.\n\nMuch of that rise can be attributed to excitement about positive regulatory action. Speculation is rife that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve exchange traded funds that invest in bitcoin directly. Coinbase stands to benefit by acting as custodian of bitcoins held by ETF funds.\n\nBitcoin cheerleaders hope that such vehicles will broaden the investor base and fuel a price rise. Bitcoin prices rose 160 per cent in 2023. This week they climbed above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022.\n\nYet even as investors pile into Coinbase shares and bitcoin prices rise, trading activity on the platform remains relatively subdued. The number of monthly transacting users stood at just 6.7mn at the end of the third quarter, down from 8.5mn a year ago. Trading volume slid by more than 50 per cent over the period, while total transaction revenue was a fifth lower.\n\nFourth-quarter results, due in February, should show an uptick. But this has already been baked into Coinbase\u2019s valuation. Despite seven consecutive quarters of losses, the company trades on 16 times revenue, up from 1.6 times a year ago. Larger and more profitable exchange operators Cboe and the London Stock Exchange are on 5 times and 6 times respectively.\n\nTo its credit, Coinbase has diversified its revenue. Half now comes from subscription and services, which include its custody services, interest-earning assets and staking. Still, its fortunes are tied to bitcoin\u2019s wild swings and regulatory attitudes towards crypto \u2014 two factors outside its control.\n\nA decision on regulatory approval for spot bitcoin ETFs could be delayed. In the meantime, Coinbase is in its own fight with the SEC, accused of illegally running an unregistered securities exchange. It has failed to push the SEC to clarify whether digital assets are securities. Having enjoyed a surprising resurgence from a tumultuous 2022, Coinbase could struggle to hold on to its rich valuation this year."

        "title": "MicroStrategy's Bold Bitcoin Bet: Risks, Rewards, and Future Outlook - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Business intelligence expert MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.06%) still runs a successful software business. I know, that's easy to forget in an era where founder and chairman Michael Saylor is leaning heavily into buying Bitcoin (BTC -8.48%) -- it makes sense to think of MicroStrategy as an alternative way to own the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nLet's take a look at MicroStrategy's Bitcoin business. Does the software division even matter anymore?\n\nMicroStrategy's Bitcoin focus\n\nSaylor isn't shy about the importance Bitcoin holds in MicroStrategy's operations. The recent third-quarter report started with two Bitcoin-related bullet points before moving on to traditional financial metrics such as revenue and growth trends on the software side. Searching that document, you'll find 28 mentions of \"Bitcoin\" and just 15 instances of \"revenue\" or \"revenues.\"\n\nFor instance, the company added 6,067 Bitcoins during the third quarter, boosting the total holdings to 158,400 coins as of Oct. 31, 2023. I'm sure there are more Bitcoins on that balance sheet by now; MicroStrategy just hasn't posted any updates since then.\n\nThe coins were acquired at an overall cost of $4.69 billion over a three-year period. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings are worth $6.99 billion at today's market price.\n\nMichael Saylor looks like a genius in times like these, when Bitcoin's street price is higher than the average purchase price. You'll see it in MicroStrategy's stock price, too. The stock rose 355% over the last year, thanks to a 157% increase in Bitcoin's market price.\n\nMicroStrategy's stock: Riding the Bitcoin roller-coaster\n\nThe reverse is also true, of course. When Bitcoin is down, MicroStrategy reports financial losses and the stock price drops. Michael Saylor becomes a headline-writing punching bag under those circumstances.\n\nAll in all, owning MicroStrategy stock has been a solid proxy for holding Bitcoin directly since Michael Saylor's digital investment started. The price swings aren't always exactly aligned but the long-term relationship is pretty clear:\n\nMind you, the software operation serves as a solid foundation for this exploration of digital assets. MicroStrategy's software license sales rose 16% year over year in the third quarter, along with a 28% uptick in subscription service revenue.\n\nThere is clearly a robust demand for the company's business intelligence tools, which now includes a generative AI interface to help clients make the most of the underlying data analysis tools. MicroStrategy's platform is integrated with the leading cloud computing platforms and the customer list includes household names such as Sony, Walt Disney, and Visa. This Tableau rival is no joke.\n\nThe software business you forgot\n\nSorry about the whiplash risk, but here's another plot twist. Despite the healthy results in MicroStrategy's business intelligence software, the company is investing all of the resulting profits in more Bitcoin -- and then some.\n\nHere's one way to look at it. MicroStrategy generated $11.5 million of cash from operations in the first three quarters of 2023. The cash profits were culled from $372 million of top-line revenues in the same period.\n\nAnd Saylor's crew raised $824 million of extra cash by selling freshly printed stock shares. The number of issued shares rose by 35% over the last year, diluting the value of existing shareholder stakes by the same amount. These market-moving effects are accounted for in the price charts above, which goes a long way toward explaining how a company that keeps buying more Bitcoin effectively moves in tandem with the digital currency itself. MicroStrategy's cash-raising efforts undermine the benefits for stockholders.\n\nBut that's what it takes to keep the Bitcoin flow going. The company invested another $688 million in digital assets across the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nMicroStrategy's promising but risky stock\n\nThere you have it. MicroStrategy has become a Bitcoin wallet with a successful but hugely overshadowed software business. The rise and fall of Bitcoin's value dictates how MicroStrategy's business performs as a whole, and you already saw how that translates into a Bitcoin-synchronized price chart.\n\nSo if you expect big things from Bitcoin in the long run, but your brokerage only offers traditional asset classes like stocks and exchange-traded funds, MicroStrategy can serve as a substitute for the real thing. You might also expect the charting lines to separate in the long run as MicroStrategy's need to raise additional cash goes away -- a possible effect of sustained Bitcoin price gains.\n\nThen again, MicroStrategy's all-in tactics also add a lot of risk. This crypto winter may be thawing, but what if the next gets even colder and lasts longer? Or, even worse, what if Bitcoin never turns out to be the future of financial assets at all? MicroStrategy's balance sheet could collapse in a hurry.\n\nIn other words, MicroStrategy may look like a pound-for-pound Bitcoin alternative but both the potential upsides and the downside risks are highly amplified versions of the original cryptocurrency. Personally, I prefer owning actual Bitcoin tokens or a simpler alternative such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Feel free to dabble in MicroStrategy's stock, just be careful out there."

        "title": "Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC -9.11%) soared by more than 150% last year, investors are now looking far and wide for cryptocurrencies that might be able to outperform Bitcoin in 2024. One intriguing candidate is Ethereum (ETH -9.51%), which is still the world's second-most valuable cryptocurrency with a whopping $270 billion market cap.\n\nWhile Ethereum might not get the same hype as Bitcoin, it's certainly worth a closer look, especially if some of the catalysts expected to push Bitcoin higher fail to materialize. Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nJust about everyone agrees that investor anticipation of a new spot Bitcoin ETF is the key factor pushing Bitcoin higher right now. The underlying logic makes sense: A new regulated financial product for investing in Bitcoin should attract money from both retail and institutional investors. If institutional investors with trillions of dollars of assets under management allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, that could result in literally tens of billions of dollars flowing into Bitcoin. That would almost certainly cause the price of Bitcoin to soar.\n\nBut there are several problems with that argument, says JPMorgan Chase (JPM -1.78%). In a December research note to clients, JPMorgan Chase specifically pointed out that much of the hype around the Bitcoin ETF might be undeserved. For one, spot Bitcoin ETF products exist elsewhere in the world (in both Canada and Europe), and they have experienced relatively weak demand. What's to say that the U.S. market will be different?\n\nMoreover, there are other Bitcoin investment products to choose from right now. Popular choices include Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -5.76%) and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO -5.59%). So instead of huge flows of new money into Bitcoin, we might just see a reshuffling of money out of existing Bitcoin investment products and into the new spot Bitcoin ETF. The net impact, in that case, would not be nearly as great as some are now predicting.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nThe second major catalyst for Bitcoin is the approaching halving event. This event, which occurs only once every four years, is coming up in April, and it's likely to be one of the most talked-about developments in the crypto market this year. In three past halvings, the price of Bitcoin has soared, and many investors are expecting the same to happen again. In fact, some are now predicting that Bitcoin could push through the $100,000 mark by the end of the year.\n\nBut keep in mind that a growing number of influential voices on Wall Street think that much of the Bitcoin halving's impact might already be priced in. If you buy into the efficient market hypothesis, which says that all publicly available information is already factored into prices, then maybe the halving will be a non-event.\n\nAfter all, the entire market knows when the halving is going to take place. There are websites with clocks counting down the seconds. And the entire market has plenty of historical data to work with. Granted, the crypto market may not be as efficient as the equity market at pricing in information, but it's safe to say that every major Wall Street firm is aware of the implications of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe case for Ethereum\n\nWhile Ethereum may not have the same kinds of catalysts as Bitcoin, it is working on significant improvements to its overall blockchain architecture. Ethereum has not really delivered on everything it originally promised for The Merge, when it transitioned to a much more energy effective network. This year might be an opportunity to reassure investors that everything is still on track. If these improvements lead to lower fees, faster transaction speeds, and higher overall throughput, it could make Ethereum much more attractive to investors.\n\nMoreover, Ethereum is more likely to benefit from increased development activity in crypto than Bitcoin. That's because Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, is active in just about every major niche of the blockchain and crypto world, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, the metaverse, and Web3. During the long crypto winter that set in during 2022, many of these areas went into hibernation. But in a crypto spring, they could come back to life.\n\nAnd the better buy is...\n\nI've tried to make a compelling case for Ethereum, but if forced to choose between Bitcoin and Ethereum, I'm still going with Bitcoin. Yes, the new spot Bitcoin ETF might be overhyped. And yes, the Bitcoin halving cycle might be underwhelming this time around. But with so much institutional investor support behind it now, Bitcoin is closer to going mainstream than at any time in its history. If there's just one crypto to buy in 2024, it's Bitcoin."

        "content": "The long-awaited potential approval of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States could mean the market sees Bitcoin supply suddenly drop as funds snap up as much as they can, some market observers have predicted. With prominent firms like Ernst & Young expecting U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval to trigger massive demand from institutions, will the financial giants behind these ETFs leave any actual Bitcoin on the market for the rest of us?\n\nA U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETF could bring up to $30 billion of fresh cash into Bitcoin, crypto entrepreneur and investor Lark Davis estimated in September 2023. In such a scenario, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers would buy up about 50% of all Bitcoin on crypto exchanges to back their ETFs, he projected.\n\nEstimates are that a spot Bitcoin ETF would bring 20-30 billion of fresh cash into Bitcoin. That would buy about half of all coins on exchanges at current prices.\n\n\n\nFor reference here is what happened to gold when it got its first ETF approved on US markets.\n\n\n\nHistory repeating? pic.twitter.com/CBNvZgMq18 \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) September 4, 2023\n\nBut buying as much Bitcoin as possible would likely get tricky for anyone, several industry executives and analysts agree.\n\n\u201cTheoretically, a company or government could attempt to buy a significant amount of Bitcoin, but acquiring all Bitcoin in circulation is highly impractical, and we still have a significant, unreleased supply of Bitcoin,\u201d Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald told Cointelegraph. Wald noted that Bitcoin\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million coins, from which 1.4 million BTC are yet to be mined. She added:\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and the fact that many holders might refuse to sell at any price create a natural barrier against monopoly.\u201d\n\nMatt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise \u2014 another spot BTC ETF applicant alongside Valkyrie \u2014 also believes that no one could theoretically establish a monopoly on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe scarcity principle \u2014 a well-established economic principle \u2014 tells us that the price of a scarce good will rise to meet demand,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cIn other words, if someone tried to \u2018corner Bitcoin,\u2019 the price would rise and rise and rise as more and more reluctant sellers were met,\u201d the exec added. However, Hougan conceded that someone could still corner a significant amount of Bitcoin.\n\nJan3 CEO Samson Mow echoed Hougan\u2019s stance, expressing confidence that it would be difficult to buy all Bitcoin in circulation due to extremely high prices fueled by products like a spot Bitcoin ETF. \u201cThe price people are willing to sell increases when there are fewer coins available for sale,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to Mow, BTC holders will have to think hard about whether they should sell their Bitcoin, given the depreciation risks of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro. He said:\n\n\u201cSo as funds buy more BTC and increase their assets under management, it will become harder and harder to find willing sellers.\u201d\n\nDespite high competition among potential spot Bitcoin ETFs, these funds are unlikely to try to buy all the Bitcoin in circulation, according to David Gerard, author of the book and crypto blog Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain.\n\nRelated: \u2018Likely rejection\u2019 or smooth sailing? Experts weigh in on potential spot Bitcoin ETF\n\n\u201cETFs are part of using Bitcoin as a dollar derivative. The issuer doesn\u2019t care about the cryptocurrencies at all; they care about the dollars they can get from them,\u201d Gerard told Cointelegraph. He added:\n\n\u201cLots of holders have way more Bitcoin than there are actual dollars trying to buy \u2014 the markets are thin.\u201d\n\nAlthough many industry watchers expect spot Bitcoin ETFs to fuel massive demand and thus positively affect the BTC price, some execs like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believe that successful ETFs could \u201ccompletely destroy\u201d Bitcoin. According to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, some investors might \u201csell on the news\u201d of spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the short term.\n\nMeanwhile, some believe that the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. could have little to no impact on markets, as multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs have been trading for years in other parts of the world, such as Canada.\n\nHowever, the size of U.S. capital markets is so large that this comparison may be irrelevant, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The crypto market has never seen an injection of capital of this potential magnitude, as Balchunas and other analysts predict.\n\nSource: Eric Balchunas/X (formerly Twitter)\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US"

        "title": "3 Crypto Predictions for 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a brutal crypto winter in 2022, the resurgence that swept through the crypto asset class in 2023 was more than refreshing. With signs that a bull market might be looming ahead, 2024 is shaping up to be a year for the history books.\n\nWhile they might seem outlandish, here are three predictions for the upcoming year. Remember, this is crypto -- stranger things have happened.\n\nIt's still Bitcoin's year\n\nLet's cut to the chase: Bitcoin (BTC -9.11%) might have a better 2024 than it did in 2023. With the first prediction for the new year, Bitcoin should hit a new all-time high.\n\nLast year, Bitcoin's rise could be attributed to the anticipated approval of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and fresh interest in novel use cases like Ordinals, a Bitcoin-based equivalent of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nWhile these two catalysts helped renew sentiment across the crypto market, they will likely prove to be minor accelerants compared to what 2024 has in store. The most influential development pushing Bitcoin toward an all-time high is the upcoming halving. Hardwired into Bitcoin's code, the halving reduces Bitcoin's inflation rate in half roughly every four years. Currently sitting at 1.75%, in April of this year it will fall to 0.85%.\n\nHistorically, halvings have been significant drivers of price appreciation as demand must adjust to a diminished inflation rate. In years that a halving occurred, Bitcoin has grown by more than 128% on average. A jump of this magnitude would put Bitcoin's price at $99,000 -- a new all-time high.\n\nTo take it a step further, this halving will be unlike any other. For most of Bitcoin's history, the rate of freshly mined supply more or less kept up with demand. But that shifted recently. Currently, only 2.3 million coins are available on exchanges for purchase, a level not seen since 2017. As a result, the upcoming halving will be the first time in history that there are fewer available coins than at the previous halving. With an unprecedented supply shock inbound, don't be surprised if Bitcoin hits six figures in 2023.\n\nThe Bitcoin renaissance continues\n\nCategorized as a Layer 2 blockchain since it operates in tandem with a Layer 1 blockchain, Stacks (STX -9.25%) unlocks Bitcoin to take on new use cases and realize its true potential as the foundation of a decentralized economy.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the popularity of Ordinals sparked interest in building Bitcoin-based solutions, allowing it to take on use cases beyond just a store of value. As general interest transformed into a movement, Stacks became a natural beneficiary with its Bitcoin compatibility and rose more than 200% in 2023. Yet this is just scratching the surface of what may come in 2024.\n\nScheduled to go live in April, the Nakamoto Release will unveil novel functionality that allows Bitcoin holders to swap their Bitcoin for a new asset, sBTC, and then use that token across the DeFi economy. Once finishing their DeFi activities, holders can seamlessly redeem their sBTC for the original BTC. Since sBTC's price is pegged to BTC, there is no slippage, and best of all, the exchange process is done in a decentralized and secure fashion through the use of smart contracts, preserving Bitcoin's distinct characteristics.\n\nFor the second prediction of 2024, expect Stacks to double in value and become a top 20 most valuable cryptocurrency. With the Bitcoin renaissance gaining steam, Stacks is in an ideal position to continue growing and claim the spotlight.\n\nEthereum is overdue for a run\n\nWhile Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies rode waves of momentum in 2023, Ethereum (ETH -9.51%) more or less watched from the sidelines. It still jumped an admirable 80% but paled in comparison to other notable altcoins like Solana, which made gains of more than 900%, and Avalanche, which jumped 250%.\n\nBut this might change in 2024 as Ethereum is scheduled to get another critical upgrade. Known as EIP-4844 and expected to be released in the second half of the year, the upgrade will reduce transaction costs and boost throughput to 100,000 transactions per second, effectively solving two of the main challenges hampering Ethereum's maturation. Building off of The Merge from 2022, a previous upgrade that switched the blockchain from proof of work to proof of stake, EIP-4844 is just one out of a series of upgrades that aims to \"grow Ethereum until it's powerful enough to help all of humanity.\"\n\nDespite its lackluster performance in 2023, Ethereum remains the premier blockchain for novel use cases of cryptocurrencies such as decentralized finance, NFTs, yield farming, and more. When considering the added benefit EIP-4844 will bring to the ecosystem, my third prediction for 2024 is that it should be the year that Ethereum reminds the crypto world that it is the undisputed home of decentralized finance and makes a run of historic magnitude."

        "content": "Arbitrum (CRYPTO: ARB) is among the leading large-cap cryptocurrencies in the market this week. As of 1:45 p.m. ET, Arbitrum has surged 27.2% since last Friday's close and is one of the only top cryptos to have reached a fresh all-time high this past week.\n\nFor mega-cap cryptos, it's been a rather ho-hum week. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), for example, ended the week up 3.7% and down 3.4%, respectively. Hence, the outsize interest in names like Arbitrum.\n\nHere's what investors are watching closely when it comes to this Layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution right now.\n\nArbitrum passes Ethereum in decentralized exchange volume\n\nThe big headline that drove an incredible amount of interest in Arbitrum relative to other top cryptos over the past week is a surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume on the Arbitrum network. Earlier today, Arbitrum pushed past Ethereum to process a 24-hour trading volume of $1.83 billion, making this the leading platform in terms of daily DEX volume.\n\nArbitrum's surge in trading volume was very noticeable, with overall volume increasing more than 32% over the past week. Ethereum's corresponding volume dropped nearly 5% over the same period. Arbitrum's infrastructure, which includes using optimistic rollups to improve speed, scalability, and cost on its network, appears to be striking a chord with traders. In the highly competitive market for DEX market share, Arbitrum is not so quietly rising in the ranks.\n\nTo make things better, Arbitrum also announced record-high total value locked (TVL) metrics this week. The project's overall TVL surged past the $2.5 billion mark for the first time, surpassing Layer-1 network Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) in the process.\n\nAdditionally, Orbit (a Layer-3 project providing developers with the ability to build applications on Arbitrum) announced this week that ARC-20 tokens can now be used for transaction fees. This added benefit for Orbit's individual blockchains and corresponding decentralized applications appears to be spurring overall ecosystem growth for Arbitrum.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat now?\n\nArbitrum appears to be firing on all cylinders. The network's lower-cost, higher-throughput ecosystem is clearly one developers are looking to build upon and users are flocking to. So long as these fundamental metrics continue to improve, this project could certainly continue to see momentum well into 2024.\n\nNow, some of Arbitrum's transaction volume surge can be attributed to a meme token-driven frenzy in recent months. Most conservative investors wouldn't bet the farm on that continuing, and at some point, I think the fuel this catalyst is providing will run out.\n\nThat said, Arbitrum's infrastructure and value as a scaling solution are being validated in a big way by the market. For those betting on growth within the Ethereum ecosystem (with the majority of the spoils in terms of volume going to scaling solutions like Arbitrum), this is a crypto to keep your eye on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ARB right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ARB, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ARB wasn't one of them.

        "title": "BlackRock layoffs coming as firm matures, ESG pullback and Bitcoin ETF approval - Fox Business",
        "content": "BlackRock, the world's largest money management firm, plans to announce layoffs in the coming days of about 3 percent of its global workforce, Fox Business has learned.\n\nThe job cuts of around 600 employees, which have yet to be reported, are being described internally as routine, according to a source familiar. Last year, BlackRock did a similar round of layoffs gauged on employee performance metrics, the source added.\n\nShares of BlackRock rebounded in 2023, up 6 percent after falling 21 percent in 2022. New customer money into BlackRock's solid Exchange Traded Fund business exploded last year with $187 billion of inflows into the products that follow a basket of securities and trade like stocks on major exchanges.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BLK BLACKROCK INC. 809.12 -16.92 -2.05%\n\nOn Wednesday, BlackRock is expecting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for its new Bitcoin \"spot\" ETF \u2014 the first time a crypto investment product tracking the daily price of the world's most popular digital coin will be approved by securities regulators to trade on a public stock market. Other asset managers are also expecting approval for their ETFs.\n\nBLACKROCK, STATE STREET FACE SUBPOENAS IN HOUSE ESG PROBE\n\nA BlackRock spokesman would not comment on the layoffs. BlackRock is scheduled to announce fourth quarter earnings on Friday.\n\nOne possible impetus for the layoffs is that BlackRock, after years of wild growth in assets under management or AUM, is settling into a more mature phase in its business. Analyst consensus for earnings in its fourth quarter projects a 2.46 percent decline year-over-year to $8.71 a share.\n\nBlackRock finished the third quarter of 2023 with $9 trillion in AUM though the firm has seen significant asset declines since it reached a peak of more than $10 trillion in 2022 amid wobbly financial markets. The decline in assets also came as BlackRock became a political lightning rod over its embrace of Environmental Social Governance investing, or ESG, which directs investment dollars into public companies in the sustainable energy space, or those that are taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint and advocate corporate governance measures such as boardroom diversity.\n\nDECEMBER JOBS BREAKDOWN: WHICH INDUSTRIES HIRED THE MOST WORKERS LAST MONTH?\n\nThe firm has been de-emphasizing its ESG business in the U.S. amid the controversy, Fox Business has learned. U.S. portfolio managers are no longer required to consider ESG metrics when not using ESG funds. In 2023, many so-called green investment funds have seen declines in asset amid weak performance as investments in sustainable energy products fail to produce significant returns.\n\nCompany founder and CEO Larry Fink told Fox Business he won't use the mention of the letters E-S-G any longer because of the controversy it has stirred up in political circles.\n\nUS ECONOMY ADDS 216K JOBS IN DECEMBER, BEATING EXPECTATIONS\n\nAs top Republicans, including several running for the GOP presidential nomination, have attacked BlackRock and ESG, those running pension funds in red states have yanked about $6 billion from BlackRock funds as a form of protest.\n\nNoticeably quiet from the BlackRock bashing is the GOP front-runner, former President Donald Trump. One reason may be because BlackRock once managed Trump's fortune, estimated in the billions of dollars. In 2017, Trump said of Fink: \"Larry did a great job for me. He managed a lot of my money. I have to tell you, he got me great returns.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nPeople close to BlackRock tell Fox Business that savings from the job cuts will be used to expand into growth businesses such as technology investing and investing in so-called alternative products as opposed to stocks and bonds.\n\nESG, meanwhile, remains a big business with BlackRock's foreign customers, including large sovereign wealth funds in Europe and the Middle East. Mark Wiedman, head of BlackRock's client business, speaking at a recent event sponsored by the news outlet Semafor, called ESG \"a demand from clients,\" with around $1 trillion in pure sustainable assets being managed by BlackRock."

        "title": "The African village mining Bitcoin - UnHerd",
        "content": "Bondo is a scattered cluster of villages in a remote region of Malawi near the border with Mozambique. It sits in the foothills of Mount Mulanje, where residents rely on their feet for transport and a few crops to feed their families. Yet unlike in most places in this impoverished country, when night descends they can now switch on lights, stoves and televisions in their homes.\n\nFor electricity has arrived in Bondo. Three turbines were installed in a micro-hydro scheme exploiting the fertile region\u2019s rainfall. And the impact has been life-changing for the 1,800 homes so far connected to a mini-grid. Children can study after dark, so now have a better chance of passing the exams for secondary school rather than having to leave aged 11. Drugs and food can be stored in fridges, so villagers do not have to make the 12-mile trek to the hospital and can produce batches of food or drinks to sell at market. Cooking the evening meal is three times quicker \u2014 and far less destructive to the environment \u2014 without the need to collect firewood.\n\nOne group of women giggled when I asked if they had televisions and watched football in their homes. \u201cBefore, our husbands would say they were going off to watch football when they were really walking out with other women. Now they can no long claim they are going off for football,\u201d Bertha told me. The senior chief told me they had never dreamed of having energy supplied to the villages, with a dozen maize mills, many small enterprises, schools, shops and churches also connected to the grid. \u201cWhen you move around Bondo you see happy people \u2014 and that\u2019s because of electricity.\u201d\n\nYet the big surprise in Bondo is not simply the supply of energy to such an isolated community, in a country where only one in eight citizens has access to grid electricity and on a continent where almost half the 1.2 billion population still lack this life-changing supply. The real eye-opener is the stack of 32 computers inside the concrete pump shed. This innovative mini-grid \u2014 located more than two hours from Malawi\u2019s second city of Blantyre along bumpy roads and tracks that can become impassable in a torrential downpour \u2014 is mining Bitcoin to fund its operation.\n\nIt is a smart idea. The computers used to create valuable new Bitcoin tokens and validate transactions consume around the same amount of energy as a medium-sized country such as Sweden would generate. Hence the stinging critique of how this cryptocurrency wastes the planet\u2019s precious resources. This initiative flips that narrative by using Bitcoin mining to fund energy in parts of Africa that are too poor or remote to merit connection to grids, but which do have plentiful supplies of potential power sources. Mining soaks up the excess energy of these renewable plants. And this delivers not just electricity but a powerful jolt to to drive development in the local economy.\n\nThe concept comes from a Kenyan firm, Gridless, set up in 2022, whose backers include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. There are four other sites in Kenya and Zambia and plans for scores more across the continent. Its aim is to demonstrate how Africa could play a central role in countering the conventional belief that Bitcoin, now 15 years old, is used simply for risky speculation and dodgy transactions. Instead, it backs those who claim it will lead to more inclusive financial systems as it usurps the control of dysfunctional governments and manipulative central banks.\n\nIt will also release the community from reliance on foreign handouts to survive. The Bondo power plants were built by Mount Mulanje Conservation Trust, a local group trying to protect the mountain region\u2019s unique bio-diversity, and were initially supported by finance from aid and development agencies \u2014 but now Bitcoin covers the running costs. This offers a commercial incentive that does not rely on altruism or subsidies to deliver power to remote regions, while exploiting energy waste at times of low use such as overnight.\n\nMalawi, one of the world\u2019s poorest nations, provides a powerful case study in the failures of aid. As former development minister Rory Stewart said in a lecture at Yale, Britain gave \u00a34.5billion over half a century to this southern African country corroded by corruption and bad governance, yet it ended up \u201cif anything, poorer than it was when we started\u201d.\n\n\u201cBitcoin can prevent Bondo becoming the sort of white elephant that you see across Africa, built by aid groups and then abandoned,\u201d said Erik Hersman, chief executive of Gridless. He admits that he is \u201cnot a big fan\u201d of the sector. \u201cThey come in with low-cost loans and grants to finance all these schemes that they say will pay their way in 30 years but the sums never add up. This is a new way to finance development.\u201d\n\nMalawi also demonstrates another reason why there is rising interest in Bitcoin in Africa: people are seeking a safer home for their cash than local currencies. Prices rose sharply after its currency was devalued two months ago by 44% against the US dollar \u2014 the second decrease in value of the kwacha in 18 months. Many African countries on the continent have suffered also from catastrophic inflation, while official currency conversion rates can be significantly lower than street rates.\n\nOne Kenyan entrepreneur told me she turned to the cryptocurrency after seeing her savings constantly eroded even in a country with lower than average inflation for the continent. \u201cI was trying to save to buy a house but kept finding my sums declining. I wanted more stability so tried Bitcoin, and then found it had other uses,\u201d said Marcel Lorraine, founder of Bitcoin DADA. Her clients include a trader of alternative health products in a Nairobi street market, who found it much cheaper to use than changing currencies after being introduced to it by a Nigerian customer and is now hoping it will provide a stable platform for building her business to obtain a shop.\n\nWhile Warren Buffet dismissed Bitcoin as \u201cprobably rat poison squared\u201d and the economist Paul Krugman has compared it to a Ponzi scam fuelled by libertarian fantasies and \u201ctechnobabble\u201d, devotees see it as a liberating force due to the decentralised design created by its mysterious and pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, has even applied to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that may open up the market to the US wealth management industry.\n\nCertainly Bitcoin, for all its fluctuations, can seem comparatively reliable if you live in Africa \u2014 or indeed many other parts of the planet, from Argentina to Lebanon. \u201cThis is what I have seen everywhere,\u201d said Peter McCormack, who travels the world for a Bitcoin podcast. \u201cHere is an alternative to gold and property for a middle class that has some money and patience, but is seeing expenses and costs rise while savings decline in value. And a strong middle class helps build a strong economy by driving consumer spending, reducing reliance on the state and driving innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has also become a helpful tool for activists and journalists in dictatorships, since it makes it far harder to track funds. In Togo, a West African state run by one despotic family since 1967, it is used to channel cash to opposition and civil society leaders despite the freezing of bank accounts. Bitcoin has been instrumental in delivering donations to Alexei Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation in Russia and the pro-democracy movements in Belarus and Myanmar.\n\nAlex Gladstein, chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation and author of a book arguing that Bitcoin offers freedom from archaic monetary systems and political strife, believes the cryptocurrency is especially exciting for Africans, since they suffer \u201call kinds of financial repression\u201d. He points out there are 45 currencies on the continent \u2014 with 15 still controlled by France \u2014 with high transaction fees on conversion deals that are largely processed by Western firms with heavily-fluctuating rates. \u201cBitcoin provides an escape and an alternative for Africans while its use is less limited than some people think,\u201d he says. \u201cEntrepreneurs there have figured out how people without the internet can use Bitcoin, which is frankly remarkable.\u201d\n\nThis agility is typical of the technological innovation exploding across Africa, driven by a young, rapidly growing and increasingly well-educated population. \u201cThe beautiful thing about Bitcoin is that it is a bottom-up technology and its adoption has been genuine at all levels,\u201d said one key figure at the second African Bitcoin Conference in Ghana at the end of last year.\n\nOnly time will tell if Satoshi\u2019s invention will turn out to be a bubble with bad consequences or, as optimists believe, a driver of profound change in the world. The fraud conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, who ran one of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, and admission of money-laundering by the boss of another major exchange has hurt the reputation of cryptocurrencies for many in the West. But Bitcoin certainly seems to offer something positive in societies scarred by autocracy, colonialism, military coups and woeful governance \u2014 as seen with those computers in a concrete shed in rural Malawi turning water into streams of cash to fund electricity."

Discover SCENE\n\nAnalysts are weighing in on what happens next as the financial world awaits the first Bitcoin ETFs to be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2014especially as filings started to move forward late Friday.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart said on Twitter, \u201c[BlackRock\u2019s] 19b-4 amendment is in too. Expect to see 11 of these this evening.\u201d\n\nThere's the first 19b-4 amendment filing! Here we go. https://t.co/dz01aborw7 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 5, 2024\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSure enough, by 6 p.m. ET on Friday, all of the Bitcoin ETFs filed their 19B-4 forms with the SEC.\n\nOkay, done for the night. All 11 of these #Bitcoin ETF filers are still in the Cointucky Derby pic.twitter.com/6i8wFaWZVe \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 5, 2024\n\nOrganizations like stock exchanges or investment firms file 19b-4 with the SEC to propose rule changes. The form details the changes and reasons, undergoes public review, and awaits SEC approval.\n\n\u201cWe've been hearing that the SEC has been working with the issuers on their 19B-4s,\u201d Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said in an earlier interview with Rug Radio. \u201cThey're going back and forth on drafts. So that's why we've seen S-1 get updated. But the 19B-4s edits have gone right to the SEC. They haven't been refiled.\n\n\"So when we see those refiled, we'll know that the SEC has signed off on them as being final,\u201d he continued.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring a Friday Twitter Spaces interview with Rug Radio Balchunas suggested that once the SEC begins approving Bitcoin ETFs, the asset class could be worth billions.\n\n\u201cA couple of billion will be a solid New Year for any category, but I'd be a little more optimistic than that, like maybe $10 billion in year one,\u201d Balchunas said. \u201cIt's the short-term that is hard to predict here. In the medium term, we do see this, maybe in the ballpark of [$30 billion] to [$50 billion] over three years. And then maybe it settles to where gold is at about $100 billion over five to ten years.\u201d\n\nDriving Balchunas\u2019 bullish statement was the number of high-profile investment companies filing Bitcoin ETF applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the largest investment firm in the world, BlackRock.\n\n\u201cThis is where I think I'm more optimistic because Blackrock has these model portfolios. And they have well over $100 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if they put even 1% into this new ETF as an allocation, that's a billion dollars.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETFs track the current price of Bitcoin and should act in lockstep with Bitcoin's price swings, giving investors exposure without the need to buy and store the digital asset.\n\n\u201cI would say the ETF is a long bridge between those those two worlds, which is again why it's so interesting and fascinating.\u201d Balchunas said.\n\nBalchunas also noted the damage done to the market by the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the subsequent arrest, trial, and conviction of founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\n\u201cWhile FTX scared smaller fish out of crypto, the bigger fish are in the lake, which is what these ETFs are,\u201d Balchunas said, adding that big fish don\u2019t bite right away. \u201cThey\u2019re harder to please, and they sniff around the bait. You don\u2019t get them right off the bat like you do the small fish, but when the bites come, they should be bigger and more substantial, but I don\u2019t see a crazy feeding frenzy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBalchunas predicted that in the future, cryptocurrency trading is expected to become more cost-effective and efficient, with significantly lower transaction fees. This fee reduction will starkly contrast with the higher commissions charged by current platforms like Coinbase.\n\n\u201cFive to ten years from now, even two years from now, is you're gonna have a really cheap, very liquid [market], liquid meaning when you trade it, it's only one basis point, so that makes Coinbase commissions look like highway robbery.\u201d\n\nBalchunas also highlight the potential gains from the anticipated involvement of reputable brands and the regulatory approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he said will add credibility and trust, emphasizing the changing views of retail investors.\n\n\u201cRetail investors don\u2019t have the FOMO they did in 2021,\u201d Balchunas said.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "BitMEX, the world\u2019s leading crypto derivatives exchange, is sending Bitcoin to the Moon on January 8 at 02:18 am ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. Working in partnerships with Astrobotic, Bitcoin Magazine, and Oxcart Assembly, the mission\u2019s success will prove the potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology in creating a truly borderless financial system beyond Earth, in addition to the inaugural Western soft lunar landing since NASA\u2019s Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The Bitcoin carried on the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan rocket, and integrated onto Peregrine-1, commercial lunar lander, is scheduled to reach the Moon in late February (tentative arrival date: February 23, 2024).\n\nAfter an Earth orbit, Vulcan rocket will launch and place Peregrine-1 on a lunar trajectory outside of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where Peregrine-1 will power on and continue to the 7-week of lunar orbit phase. A live broadcast is available on NASA TV upon registration: https://shorturl.at/twyCI.\n\nStephan Lutz, CEO at BitMEX, added, \u201cThe mission is a momentous achievement in space exploration, representing the first step of creating a monetary system for a space economy. Perfectly preserved for future generations, the Bitcoin on the Moon is a time capsule that captures one of the most significant human innovations and technological advancements. This decisive leap forward is just the beginning of a new era. I\u2019m excited to see what lies ahead for decentralised finance where financial systems transcend earthly boundaries and empower individuals across the cosmos.\u201d\n\nBitMEX\u2019s physical Bitcoin, weighing 43 g and loaded with 1 BTC (equivalent to approximately US$45,000 as of January 8, 2024) is amongst the 201 payloads from governments, companies, universities, and NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative to travel to the lunar surface. Engraved with a public address (1MoonBTCixFH3XTrWRCbMpK23o74nQrA1Q) and a private key, this will be the first-ever financial asset sent to the Moon. The Bitcoin will remain on the lunar surface with Peregrine, where BitMEX invites the crypto community and future generations to interact with the physical coin, whether on Earth or in space, enabling individuals to send personal messages and their own satoshis to the Moon. Noteworthy payloads from the crypto community also include a copy of the Genesis Block from Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nBen Usinger, Head of Community at BitMEX, who also spearheaded the promotion of the mission said, \u201cWe are thrilled about the launch, thanks to the dedication of like-minded partners who share our commitment to pushing the boundaries of exploration. We hope our pursuit to expand the horizons of technology and finance will inspire a new generation of innovators and pioneers to reach for the stars. Fostering a future where cryptocurrency and space exploration go hand in hand, paving the way to explore uncharted territories and fuel the evolution of Bitcoin beyond Earth.\u201d\n\nIn celebration of this historical journey, there will be a trading competition with prizes during the orbit phases.

        "content": "Data shows the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has remained positive since the start of the year, a sign that institutional traders may be buying.\n\nBitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Is Still At Positive Levels\n\nCryptoQuant community manager Maartunn explained in a Quicktake post that there has been significant demand for Coinbase since the start of 2024.\n\nThe indicator of interest here is the \u201cCoinbase Premium Gap,\u201d which keeps track of the difference in the Bitcoin prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance. This metric can tell us how buying and selling behaviors differ between the two platforms.\n\nWhen the value of this indicator is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than that on Binance right now. Such a trend implies the former is either receiving a higher amount of buying pressure or a lower volume of selling pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, the negative metric suggests Binance is observing a higher buying pressure compared to Coinbase as the price listed on it is higher.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past week:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had been negative during the last couple of days of December, but since the start of the new year, the metric has flipped green.\n\nThe indicator had shot up alongside the rally towards $45,000, a sign that users of Coinbase fueled the move. Interestingly, the metric remained positive during the crash a couple of days back, implying the platform continued to see relatively high buying pressure.\n\nNot long after the crash, the Coinbase Premium Gap started climbing and has since reached some notable levels. What has followed this rise in the metric is the recovery that BTC has accomplished.\n\nThis would again imply that Coinbase users are driving the bullish price action. But who are the Coinbase users? As Maartunn notes, \u201cit\u2019s widely recognized that Coinbase is a preferred platform for U.S. institutional investors.\u201d\n\nBinance, on the other hand, receives more global traffic, so the Coinbase Premium Gap can provide information about how the buying pressure from American traders differs from that of world users.\n\nAs the metric has been positive recently, the US institutional investors could be accumulating currently (at least concerning what investors worldwide are doing).\n\n\u201cThis has sparked speculation about whether MicroStrategy is acquiring additional Bitcoin or if these purchases are part of preparations for an ETF approval,\u201d says the analyst. \u201cWe should have more clarity soon, as the ETF decision date is rapidly approaching.\u201d\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $43,800, up almost 3% over the past week.\n\nLooks like the price of the asset has been slowly making recovery | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com"

        "content": "The crypto world is ever-evolving, with each passing day bringing new trends and predictions. Among the recent buzz is the potential skyrocketing of Bitcoin due to rising liquidity and the steadfast performance of Cardano and Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). For those wondering how to get into cryptocurrency or which crypto to buy today for long-term gains, here\u2019s a closer look.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Potential Surge: More Than Just Numbers\n\nBitcoin, often termed the king of cryptocurrencies, has always been a focal point for investors and enthusiasts alike. Dan Tapiero, a prominent figure in the crypto realm, has projected that Bitcoin could surge past $200,000 by May 2024. This bullish forecast isn\u2019t just based on mere speculation. The impending BTC liquidity increase, coupled with the anticipated approval of the first batch of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, paints a promising picture.\n\nShould these ETFs, backed by mainstream finance giants like BlackRock, come into play, Bitcoin\u2019s accessibility to institutional investors would be unparalleled. Such a development not only bolsters Bitcoin\u2019s standing in the financial sector but also solidifies its role in the future of finance.\n\nCardano\u2019s Steady Ascent\n\nWhile Bitcoin takes centre stage, Cardano (ADA) is making waves of its own. As one of the top altcoins, Cardano has showcased resilience amidst market volatility. Recently, its recovery trajectory has been noteworthy, especially in the wake of bullish market sentiments surrounding potential Bitcoin ETF approvals. Trading at $0.65 at press time, ADA has consistently proven itself as one of the best coins to invest in.\n\nA closer look at Cardano\u2019s charts reveals a symmetrical triangle pattern, a bullish indicator hinting at potential upward movement. With major developments like the Chang hard fork slated for 2024, the Cardano ecosystem promises excitement and growth, making it a top crypto to buy for many.\n\nRebel Satoshi ($RBLZ): The New Contender\n\nIn the bustling world of cryptocurrencies, Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) has emerged as a noteworthy player. Garnering attention with its recent presale, which saw over 89 million $RBLZ sold and raising an impressive $1 million, the momentum behind Rebel Satoshi is palpable.\n\nBuilt on the robust Ethereum network, Rebel Satoshi stands tall as the best meme coin and one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. Its security is further underscored by its smart contracts, which have undergone rigorous auditing by the esteemed firm Source Hat. For those on the lookout for altcoins to buy, Rebel Satoshi\u2019s presale phase presents an opportune moment. As it exceeds the $1 million mark, investing in Rebel Satoshi now could prove rewarding in the long haul.\n\nA Dynamic Crypto Landscape Awaits\n\nThe cryptocurrency landscape is undeniably dynamic, with assets like Bitcoin, Cardano, and Rebel Satoshi constantly reshaping investor portfolios. As liquidity drives Bitcoin\u2019s potential surge and Cardano solidifies its position, Rebel Satoshi emerges as a promising contender for the discerning investor. Whether you\u2019re a crypto beginner or a seasoned trader, staying informed and seizing the right opportunities remains key in this ever-evolving market.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram"
