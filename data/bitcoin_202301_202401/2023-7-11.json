        "content": "Climate Pledges vs. Bitcoin Investments: Unveiling the $1.5 Billion Dollar Climate Bomb\n\nClick here for the full report\n\nWashington, DC (July 11, 2023)\u2013Greenpeace USA\u2019s new report exposes the financial institutions driving Bitcoin\u2019s climate destruction.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, CitiGroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express have collectively invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin mining, along with providing numerous services and investments to their customers, the report finds. Investing in Bitcoin\u2019s Climate Pollution: Big Finance is Betting on Dirty Bitcoin, released today, finds that these companies\u2019 Bitcoin investments contradict their climate commitments and the demands of science and justice.\n\nBitcoin, referred to by some as a \u201cclimate bomb,\u201d devours energy at an alarming scale, rivaling nations like Chile and Denmark; most of this energy comes from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. Coal-fired power plants slated to be closed have been kept open or even reopened to power bitcoin mining. Financial institutions are accelerating the clock on this carbon time bomb by collectively investing over $1.5 billion dollars in the mining industry and mainstreaming broader adoption. Bitcoin\u2019s climate pollution needs to be addressed immediately before it becomes a bigger problem.\n\nJoshua Archer, Greenpeace USA\u2019s Bitcoin Project Lead, said: \u201cThere is no CEO of Bitcoin. But JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock, and all of the companies we investigated have the power and resources to push for a change to the code that would eliminate nearly 100% of Bitcoin\u2019s energy use. This is a rare opportunity to eliminate a massive amount of fossil fuel use without needing to replace it with another energy source. But instead of calling for this common sense change and leading us toward a green future, financial institutions are making a risky gamble on Bitcoin at the expense of climate and communities. By investing in mining companies, creating new avenues for Bitcoin transactions, and building new services to bring Bitcoin to a broader clientele, they are operating in contradiction with their own climate pledges. We invite them and other stakeholders to the table to plot a future for Bitcoin that\u2019s compatible with a just, habitable planet for all.\u201d\n\nAll nine companies have made climate pledges or set ESG goals, yet all fail to address the glaring pollution problem posed by Bitcoin. Some have even publicly criticized Bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact, but continue to discreetly invest in and expand their Bitcoin portfolios.\n\nTo learn more about the role of financial institutions in supporting Bitcoin\u2019s climate problem, read Greenpeace USA\u2019s Report here.\n\nOur scorecard ranked asset manager BlackRock and bank JP Morgan Chase as the worst when it comes to Bitcoin. Both emerged as prominent supporters of Bitcoin by actively investing in mining companies and Bitcoin investment products. Despite their sustainability commitments to reduce carbon emissions, neither company has taken action to address Bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact.\n\nGreenpeace USA\u2019s investigation exposed a glaring contradiction, as influential figures like Blackrock CEO Larry Fink and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who have both denounced Bitcoin and claimed to be climate champions, are now deeply entrenched in substantial Bitcoin investments. At the World Economic Forum in January 2023, Dimon famously mocked cryptocurrency as a \u201cwaste of time\u201d and Bitcoin as a \u201cdecentralized Ponzi scheme\u201d and a \u201chyped-up fraud.\u201d That these key players have embraced Bitcoin raises serious concerns about the integrity and seriousness of the financial service industry\u2019s commitment to addressing climate change.\n\nArcher added: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have ESG goals and climate pledges \u2014 financial institutions must enforce them and live up to their promises. These financial institutions should follow through on their commitments and take responsibility for the significant consequences their business operations have in the real world. The impact of their inaction on pressing issues like Bitcoin\u2019s pollution problem can be far-reaching and contribute to more severe climate change.\u201d\n\nIf these C-suite executives genuinely prioritize combating the climate emergency and achieving their net-zero emission targets, it is imperative for them to acknowledge publicly the issue at hand. Greenpeace USA calls on them to push for fundamental changes in Bitcoin\u2019s code, ensuring it becomes a force for positive change rather than a contributor to climate degradation. By taking a stand, they can demonstrate true leadership in aligning financial power with environmental stewardship.\n\nMultiple attempts were made to contact executives from all nine financial institutions. Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock, and CitiGroup were willing to engage in conversations about Bitcoin pollution, but to date these discussions have yielded limited results. Fidelity, Vanguard, JPMorgan Chase, American Express, and Goldman Sachs ignored or refused Greenpeace USA\u2019s efforts to engage them on this issue.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe methodology involved selecting financial companies from the banking, asset management, and payment processing sectors based on their involvement with Bitcoin, considering their size and influence in the industry. The report examined investments and exposure through share and bond holdings in Bitcoin mining companies and the provision of services and products related to Bitcoin. Data was collected from public filings, news sources, and Bloomberg Terminal. The report acknowledges the challenges of tracking Bitcoin investments and quantifying the scope and size of Bitcoin-related services.\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], 631-404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nLAGOS, PORTUGAL \u2014 In the small coastal town of Lagos in the heart of Portugal's southern Algarve region, Didi Taihuttu begins most days on the rooftop of his villa \u2014 an unassuming home with rustic charm set atop a hill that slopes up from the Atlantic Ocean. The Mediterranean sun bounces off the bright white stucco walls of the house, illuminating the orange terracotta roof and casting a glow over Taihuttu, who sits on a plastic chair tucked under a round table of the same make. The Dutch patriarch of the Bitcoin Family drinks black coffee and pores over cryptocurrency price charts on his MacBook Pro as he decides which trades will begin his day. \"We just need a few thousand per month to live on so our performance is not really important to us,\" Taihuttu tells CNBC from his deck overlooking an expansive stretch of cobalt-colored water, cliff-backed beaches and bougainvillea.\n\nTaihuttu's family home in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nTaihuttu's self-effacement and modest surroundings belie the 45-year-old's success. In 2017, Taihuttu, along with his wife and three kids, liquidated all their assets, trading a 2,500-square-foot house and most of their earthly possessions for bitcoin and a life on the road. This was back when the price of bitcoin was about $900. Bitcoin is currently trading at over $30,000, down from an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in November 2021. Those extreme price swings have helped grow the Dutch family's crypto nest egg. For seven years, the investor has regularly been swapping his bitcoin for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins to capitalize on the volatility in the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency. When Taihuttu thinks bitcoin is reaching a bull market peak, he trades his bitcoin into stablecoins such as tether, USDC and DAI. When it appears as though bitcoin is touching cycle lows during a bear market, he starts buying it back. So far, Taihuttu says the gamble is working out great thanks to a market indicator he created himself dubbed the Didi BAM BAM.\n\nDidi Taihuttu in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nTaihuttu's indicator considers a mix of inputs, including directional trading data and moon cycles. It has guided all of Taihuttu's investing decisions since he built it before the Covid-19 pandemic. \"From mid-November to the start of December 2022, we saw the first signs the bear market was completely over,\" said Taihuttu. \"It was confirmed in January 2023 when the long flag appeared in the model.\" He added, \"People should have been buying bitcoin already, because every bitcoin you bought at $16k, it's at $30k now, so that's almost 90% upside.\" The father of three says his bitcoin investment is up about 50% since the bottom of the most recent bear market. The Taihuttus declined to share with CNBC the current dollar amount of their crypto investment in aggregate. But Taihuttu did disclose that they had fully bought back into bitcoin by the time the coin surpassed the $19,000 price threshold, so they're \"not doing so bad.\" It also helps that the nomadic family's primary domicile is in Portugal \u2014 Europe's ultimate crypto tax haven. \"You don't pay any capital gains tax or anything else in Portugal on cryptocurrency,\" said Taihuttu. \"As long as you don't earn cryptocurrency for providing services in Portugal, you're in the clear.\" \"That's a very beautiful bitcoin heaven,\" he said.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Didi Taihuttu in Lagos, Portugal. Didi Taihuttu\n\nHow the BAM BAM indicator works\n\nWhen Taihuttu began day trading tokens, he initially turned to traditional predictive metrics such as the stock-to-flow model and the Mayer Multiple \u2014 a measure calculated by dividing the current price of bitcoin by the 200-day moving average to help identify frothy moments in the market when an asset's value eclipses its intrinsic value. But spending the time reading the tea leaves of all these somewhat-related measures didn't seem like a particularly productive use of his time, so Taihuttu decided to create his own proprietary blend of the best indicators on the market. \"It's not just enough to know which indicators go into a formula,\" explained Taihuttu. \"What you can't see is the calculus and the code that implements over the stock conditions. Those calculations display in charts.\" Beginning in 2019, Taihuttu started to incubate and perfect a custom-built predictive trading tool that would weigh multiple technical indicators \u2014 plus a bit of astrology \u2014 and then spit out real-time insights into potential price swings. \"It's a combination of Bollinger Bands, Lower and Upper Bands, NMA, Red/Green Ribbon, NormStoch, RSI, Price Oscillator, Plot, MACD, Cross, Chande Momentum Oscillator, RSI-EMA, Full Moon and New Moon,\" explained Taihuttu, naming a dozen of the most popular market signals that crypto traders watch when they make investment decisions. \"Short and long signals and confirmation signals are shown on the charts when it could be a great moment to buy or sell,\" continued Taihuttu.\n\nThe Taihuttu family in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the technicals that underlie the model: Bollinger Bands focus on price volatility over time. The model consists of a simple moving average line with two standard deviation lines known as the Upper and Lower Bands . Price moves outside those outer bands can indicate whether an asset is oversold, or vice versa.\n\nfocus on price volatility over time.

Didi Taihuttu\n\nThen there are the intangible price influencers such as moon phases. \"I'm not saying it always affects the price of bitcoin, but the moon influences a lot,\" said Taihuttu. Taihuttu has found that when there is a full moon or a half moon, people tend to trade more. \"They tend to buy more, they tend to sell more,\" he said. \"Maybe it's a coincidence, but if you look at the chart, you can see that mostly at the full moon, depending on where we are in the cycle, there's a dump or a pump.\" Taihuttu added that the lunar phases also typically sync with the opening and closing of bitcoin's monthly puts and options. \"So, if we are in the top of the Bollinger Band in combination with a full moon, then you know that we are going to run,\" continued Taihuttu, suggesting a market sell-off is imminent.\n\nLosing his edge to ChatGPT\n\nTaihuttu used to sell the Didi BAM BAM indicator to traders but says he will soon give the trading tool away to selected bitcoin evangelists to help spur adoption. But he also admits his business model is disappearing. \"Anyone in the world can now go into ChatGPT and tell them, 'Write me an indicator based on the moving averages and this cycle or that cycle. And write me a script that I can implement into TradingView and then they can make their own indicators,''\" explained Taihuttu. \"I'm losing business there.\"\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards The \"Bitcoin Family\" in Thailand. Didi Taihuttu\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence is a specific form of AI that is able to produce content from scratch. The systems take inputs from the user and feed them into powerful algorithms fueled by large datasets to generate new text, images and video in a way that can appear almost human-like. AI captured the spotlight following widespread public adoption of OpenAI's GPT language processing technology. ChatGPT, which uses massive language models to create human-sounding responses to questions, has ignited an arms race among some companies over what is seen as the next \"paradigm shift\" in tech. While ChatGPT isn't able to deliver a querent a trading algorithm in Pine Script, which is TradingView's programming language, the technology does challenge the role of investment advisers. In March, Goldman Sachs' chief information officer, Marco Argenti, told CNBC the bank is experimenting with generative AI tools internally to help its developers automatically generate and test code. More recently, in May, Goldman spun off the first startup from the bank's internal incubator \u2013 an AI-powered social media company for corporate use called Louisa. The push into AI is part of a larger effort by CEO David Solomon to expedite the bank's digital makeover. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, is using it to inform its financial advisors on queries they may have. The bank has been testing an OpenAI-powered chatbot with 300 advisors so far, with a view to ultimately aid its roughly 16,000 advisors in making use of Morgan Stanley's repository of research and data, according to Jeff McMillan, head of analytics and data at the firm's wealth management division. Taihuttu uses ChatGPT himself, but more for writing articles about subjects such as bitcoin and the Lightning Network. But he notes that while it is a productivity hack, the output doesn't necessarily rank highly in search results. \"They will still find out that it's ChatGPT,\" he says. \"But it's still saving you a lot of time.\" \u2014 CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report."

        "content": "It\u2019s time to party like it\u2019s 2021! Or it feels that way if you put faith in a new report by Standard Chartered, a U.K. multinational bank that predicts the price of Bitcoin will climb to $50,000 this year and all the way to $120,000 by the end of 2024. The figures are an upward revision of an earlier bullish report by the bank and would amount to a 300% jump from its current price of around $30,000.\n\nI confess it\u2019s fun to write this\u2014if only because, after 18 months, one gets tired of reporting on regulatory crackdowns, collapsing prices, and the arrest of leading industry figures. In light of recent events, it\u2019s worth remembering crypto is not some scam but a 15-year-old project whose most high-profile asset\u2014Bitcoin\u2014is receiving bullish endorsements from major banks. (Goldman Sachs predicted $100,000 Bitcoin in early 2022.)\n\nI\u2019ve covered this industry for a decade now and believe two things are true. First, things are never as good as they seem during the bull markets\u2014blockchain is never going to transform humanity\u2014but nor are things as bad as they seem during bear markets.\n\nSecond, the price floor for Bitcoin (and possibly Ethereum) during a downturn will always be higher than the previous one. For instance, the price sunk to around $16,000 following the FTX debacle last year. Compare that with $3,000 after the popping of the 2017 bubble or $300 in 2014 after the Mt. Gox hack.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this price floor trend is a new Moore\u2019s Law. Only that it\u2019s much easier to imagine Bitcoin at $120,000 than at $10,000. Meanwhile, take note the analyst gnomes at Standard Chartered aren\u2019t pulling figures out of thin air, but are basing their prediction on a sensible thesis.\n\nThe thesis is that Bitcoin miners are making more profits, so they will sell fewer of the tokens they mine to raise cash. Fewer tokens dumped on the market means more scarcity, and that means higher prices. This scarcity trend is also going to accelerate during the next \u201chalving\u201d event in 2024, which will see the number of new Bitcoins minted every day drop from around 900 to more like 450. By the time that occurs, a lot of the scarcity will be priced in, but until then it\u2019s easy to see how the price will climb.\n\nSo will Bitcoin reach $120,000 by Dec. 31, 2024? I have no idea. Plenty of things could happen before then to deliver a major price shock to the crypto markets. Imagine, for instance, if Tether depegged or Binance collapsed or governments came together to bank crypto. But for now, the bank\u2019s prediction looks like a sound one\u2014and it\u2019s more likely the party will begin over again than get shut down for good.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase shares continue to soar in light of BlackRock's recent ETF Bitcoin application, but several analysts have expressed skepticism that the SEC will grant it.

It has evolved from an intriguing notion to a recognized asset class over time. Comparisons of Bitcoin and gold as value storage have gained popularity, with numerous important elements contributing to this impression.\n\nLimited Stock: One essential feature that Bitcoin and gold have in common is their limited quantity.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is programmed with a maximum quantity of 21 million coins, creating digital scarcity.\n\nDecentralization: Both assets operate via decentralized networks. Gold is not controlled by any single entity or government. Similarly, Bitcoin runs on a decentralized blockchain, which limits the influence of central authorities.\n\nWhen compared to actual gold, Bitcoin's digital nature provides it extraordinary portability. The convenience of transferring Bitcoin across borders and conducting digital transactions outweighs the difficulties of dealing with actual gold.\n\nBitcoin is divisible, allowing it to be divided into smaller parts and hence accommodate microtransactions. Gold, on the other hand, is typically exchanged in bigger denominations.\n\nInflation Hedging: Bitcoin and gold are frequently used as inflation and economic instability hedges. During times of economic instability, investors commonly turn to both assets to protect and maintain their money.\n\nThe Similarities of Bitcoin and Gold\n\nThe idea of Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" is supported by various similarities between the two assets:\n\nScarce Supply: Both Bitcoin and gold are based on the concept of scarcity. For millennia, gold's scarcity in the Earth's crust has been known, whereas Bitcoin's mathematical restriction of 21 million coins instills digital scarcity.\n\nBitcoin and gold both have a reputation for being safe-haven assets. Investors frequently flock to them during economic downturns and to protect their capital from the corrosive effects of inflation.\n\nDecentralization: The decentralized nature of Bitcoin's blockchain, as well as the lack of centralized authority, contribute to the perception of its independence from state influence.\n\nBitcoin and gold both derive their value from their fundamental properties. The attractiveness of gold is due to its shine, conductivity, and historical significance, but the value of Bitcoin is due to its cryptographic technology, decentralization, and usability as a digital money.\n\nBitcoin and Gold Distinctions\n\nHowever, it's crucial to grasp the features that define Bitcoin apart from gold:\n\nKeep Reading South Africa Navigates Crypto Regulations: To License 60 Firms This Month\n\nPhysical vs. Digital: Perhaps the most evident contrast is the materiality of gold and the digital nature of Bitcoin. Gold exists in the actual world, requiring secure storage and transit, but Bitcoin is a fully digital asset, stored in virtual wallets.\n\nTangibility: Gold is a physical item with a millennia-long history of being utilized in jewelry, industry, and currency. Bitcoin lacks this tactile existence and is just a digital ledger entry.\n\nIndustrial and Decorative Use: Gold serves practical applications in numerous industries and is loved for its ornamental appeal. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no industrial use and is not utilized for decoration.\n\nVolatility: Bitcoin's price volatility outperforms gold's. While this volatility provides trading opportunities, it also increases investor risk.\n\nRegulatory Environment: Bitcoin operates in a constantly changing regulatory environment. Governments throughout the world are debating how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies, but gold faces less regulatory hurdles.\n\nIs It Too Soon to Call BTC Digital Gold?\n\nBitcoin has been trading steadily around the $35,000 level, while the broader cryptocurrency market saw some ups and downs.\n\nSome are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge, akin to traditional assets like gold, against the backdrop of economic uncertainty. The growing understanding of the United States' dire fiscal situation and Bitcoin's role as a hedge is driving this sentiment. With the U.S. national debt exceeding $33 trillion and unfunded liabilities amounting to around $170 trillion, the need for quantitative easing, or money printing, is inevitable, potentially leading to the devaluation of the dollar. In this environment, Bitcoin is seen as \"gold 2.0,\" providing protection against these financial headwinds.\n\nWhile Bitcoin's status as a hedge is gaining traction, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile. Traders continue to take profits after a broader crypto rally, leading to fluctuations in various tokens. Despite the volatility, some believe the overall outlook for Bitcoin and the crypto market is promising.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may still face pullbacks and volatility, the idea of it as \"digital gold\" is gaining momentum, with some seeing it as a key asset to hedge against uncertain economic times. Whether it can fully live up to this role remains to be seen, but Bitcoin's resilience and continued presence in the financial landscape indicate that the debate is far from over.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinally, the comparison of Bitcoin and gold as stores of value is based on their similar qualities, such as restricted supply, decentralization, mobility, divisibility, and roles as inflation hedges. Differences between the two assets include materiality, tangibility, industrial application, volatility, and regulatory monitoring.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has characteristics similar to gold's attractiveness, it remains a distinct digital entity charting its own way in the world of finance and investing. Investors and enthusiasts should approach both assets with an appreciation of their unique characteristics and roles in a diversified portfolio.\n\nThe discussion over whether Bitcoin is actually \"digital gold\" is expected to continue, reflecting cryptocurrencies' continued evolution and role in the global economy."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) that once belonged to the Silk Road is on the move \u2014 about four months after the US Department of Justice (DOJ) sold millions of dollars worth of it on Coinbase.\n\nA string of transactions involving Silk Road bitcoin was waiting to be confirmed Wednesday morning. Altogether, 9,825 BTC ($302.2 million) queued for sending by addresses tied to the DOJ.\n\nThe addresses are directing the bitcoin to unused addresses. The DOJ has shuffled its Silk Road stash before, so it\u2019s too soon to say it intends to be sold immediately.\n\nStill, authorities offloaded 9,800 BTC in March directly to US-based platform Coinbase for $21,800 per token, generating $215 million.\n\nAt the time, officials said they intended to sell an additional 41,500 BTC ($1.27 billion) seized from Silk Road hacker James Zhong across four batches.\n\nBitcoin is today worth $31,600 after shedding a few hundred dollars after word of the transfers first broke.\n\nSilk Road, one of the first marketplaces powered by bitcoin payments, went dark in October 2013 as US authorities arrested founder Ross Ulbricht. He was charged the following year and eventually sentenced to consecutive life sentences plus 40 years without parole.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s pending Silk Road transactions are currently facing a confirmation delay, potentially caused by inadequate transaction fees. (The transactions were later confirmed.)\n\nOne had been waiting 20 minutes at time of writing, another for more than 40 minutes, with both blocks unconfirmed. The DOJ appears to have only allocated a meager sum, only $8 in fees, for these transactions. Bitcoin blocks are processed on average once every 10 minutes.\n\nThe last time the department sold coins connected to the Silk Road, the US government paid more than $215,000 in transaction fees, officials said in court filings.\n\nA portal tracking bitcoin seized by the US government shows the Feds have missed out on $5.6 billion by selling BTC rather than holding it.\n\nUpdated Jul. 12, 2023 at 11:09 am ET: Two transactions were confirmed after around an hour. A third transaction is still pending after almost two hours. Code is law.\n\nUpdated Jul. 12, 2023 at 11:31 am ET: The third transaction was finalized after around two hours and five minutes.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Can banks push Bitcoin to clean up its act? - The Verge",
        "content": "It\u2019s time for banks and asset managers to start pushing Bitcoin to clean up its pollution, Greenpeace argues in a new report. The environmental organization wants to see Bitcoin change its code to slash energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s a big ask, but Greenpeace argues that financial institutions could have an outsize influence on the Bitcoin network through its business dealings.\n\n\u201cThe report focused on nine major financial institutions that are providing the glue that keeps the Bitcoin ecosystem together,\u201d says Joshua Archer, who leads Greenpeace USA\u2019s Bitcoin campaign. \u201cFinancial institutions have an important responsibility, but they\u2019re currently ignoring the severity of the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report focused on nine major financial institutions that are providing the glue that keeps the Bitcoin ecosystem together\u201d\n\nThose financial institutions \u2014 including BlackRock, Vanguard, JPMorgan Chase, and others \u2014 controlled shares in Bitcoin mining companies that were valued at more than $1.35 billion in April 2023, according to Greenpeace\u2019s report. Many of the financial companies are also expanding their services to make it easier for customers to deal in Bitcoin. That could increase the cryptocurrency\u2019s already hefty environmental footprint, the report says. Crypto companies are facing a storm of scrutiny from regulators after FTX\u2019s spectacular collapse. Democrats are also pressing companies on Bitcoin\u2019s impact on power grids and climate goals. Despite those headwinds, Bitcoin\u2019s emissions can still rise every time its price rallies.\n\nBitcoin is by far the most polluting cryptocurrency. That\u2019s not just because it\u2019s the biggest by market cap but because of the way the blockchain validates transactions. Bitcoin miners run data centers full of specialized machines that solve complex puzzles around the clock. They earn new Bitcoin this way, but all that puzzle-solving comes with energy and environmental costs. The cryptocurrency uses about as much electricity annually as the country of Sweden.\n\nGreenpeace isn\u2019t asking these companies to divest from Bitcoin. Instead, it\u2019s pushing for the blockchain to switch to a new way of validating transactions that gets rid of energy-sucking puzzles. That\u2019s what the second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, did last year \u2014 drastically slashing its energy consumption and emissions in the process.\n\nThere\u2019s been resistance to do the same thing with Bitcoin, though. Miners have already invested in their equipment and would be hard-pressed to throw it all away, for one. And to make the switch, every node on the network would need to be on board. That\u2019s a tough sell for folks who might have bought into Bitcoin in the first place because it\u2019s supposed to be decentralized \u2014 theoretically free from any single institution telling them what to do.\n\nGreenpeace makes the case that financial institutions actually do hold sway. BlackRock is a leader in the pack when it comes to asset managers\u2019 support for Bitcoin, according to the Greenpeace report. Its shareholdings in 18 Bitcoin mining companies were valued at more than $595 million in April. The report also \u201cdraw[s] a direct line from BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin mining investments to the revival of fossil fuel infrastructure.\u201d For example, BlackRock is the biggest institutional shareholder in Greenidge Generation Holdings, a company that uses a previously shuttered gas power plant almost exclusively to mine Bitcoin.\n\nAmong banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the leading Bitcoin supporter, according to the Greenpeace report. It controlled shares in 17 Bitcoin mining companies valued at more than $26 million in April and offers different products and services to help customers invest in Bitcoin. That contradicts the bank\u2019s goal of helping the world reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the Greenpeace report says. And Chase hasn\u2019t been transparent about whether it includes emissions from Bitcoin in its carbon accounting \u2014 a problem for the financial sector overall, Archer says."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could finally change its tune regarding spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds. A notable rally in the largest cryptocurrency fueled speculation. And data indicate large institutional players are increasing their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThat could prove impactful for equity-based, crypto-related exchange traded funds, such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) . Actually, it already is as SATO is higher by a staggering 147% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nBitcoin has been trending higher over the past several weeks as a slew of traditional asset managers, including some of the biggest names in the ETF industry, filed applications for spot biotin ETFs. And that\u2019s a sign credible money managers and fund issuers see long-term viability in it. As such, fund holdings of the digital asset are approaching 696,000 coins.\n\nWhy It Matters to SATO\n\nSATO follows the Alerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts, and ETPs Index. And the bulk of its 35 equity holdings engage in crypto mining. This industry correlates to the prices of the assets mined.\n\nSo the higher Bitcoin prices go, the more benefits SATO holdings accrue. A clear, efficient avenue for higher Bitcoin prices is for more institutional buyers to enter the market. But not only do they buy in size, they bring credibility to an asset class that\u2019s long faced doubts and concerns regarding volatility and excessive speculation by smaller investors.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, though, recent news of new entrants into Bitcoin underscores the staying power of this asset class more broadly. And many investors view this as a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity,\u201d Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nGrayscale is the company behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) . And that Bitcoin-backed index is SATO\u2019s largest holding at a weight of 15% and is a prime candidate to convert to the ETF wrapper, should the SEC approve spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOther data points confirm institutional adoption and retailer investors holding Bitcoin for longer periods, including a declining number of Bitcoin on public exchanges. Both could be pivotal in establishing near-term price support for the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cAs the decline in inflows and supply unfolds, another intriguing trend emerges. Institutional fund accumulation, as observed by CryptoQuant. Institutional investors, including hedge funds, investment firms, and cryptocurrency private funds, are currently actively increasing their holdings of Bitcoin,\u201d reported Newsbtc.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nvettafi.com is owned by VettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d).

        "content": "My first journalism job was so long ago that we were required to capitalize Blockchain.\n\nDoes looking at Blockchain (look, I did it again) capitalized in the middle of a sentence like that make you uncomfortable?\n\nIt makes me uncomfortable.\n\nThankfully, we\u2019ve since moved on as a society. We now recognize blockchain as just another technology, so it has naturally lost its need for that capital \u201cB\u201d.\n\nBitcoin, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t seem to carry the same simplicity.\n\nYou\u2019ll see both Bitcoin and bitcoin in the wild, seemingly changing form as one hops among the various media.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear that \u201cbitcoin\u201d is a currency, so it is left uncapitalized, like dollars, yen, euros, krona. But \u201cBitcoin\u201d is the formal name of the network \u2014 thus, it needs that proper noun capitalization.\n\nOh, wait! \u201cBitcoin\u201d is both a network and a currency, so it must always be capitalized. But then \u201cbitcoin\u201d needs to match \u201cblockchain,\u201d so it definitely must never be capitalized. Yet \u201cbitcoins\u201d isn\u2019t a word, since \u201cyens\u201d isn\u2019t a word, so \u201cbitcoin\u201d can also be plural.\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cbitcoins\u201d has to be a word, because \u201cdollars\u201d is a word, so \u201cbitcoin\u201d can\u2019t really be plural.\n\nThis type of semantic dispute may only be interesting to grammar freaks and die-hard crypto enthusiasts, but the confusion \u2014 and frustration in both camps \u2014 speaks to the industry\u2019s broader language dilemma.\n\nTo put it bluntly, crypto has a really hard time being understood, and it\u2019s entirely its own fault.\n\nTo on-chain or not to onchain\n\nCrypto Twitter, per usual, hosted the latest crypto language debate this week.\n\nA small group of enthusiasts (read: tiny, fewer than 100 followers) is attempting to raise enough money to buy a billboard next to Mirriam Webster\u2019s headquarters that reads \u201conchain is a new word.\u201d\n\nCrypto Twitter pedants went, well, a little nuts in response.\n\nNot over whether minting NFTs of a simulated \u201conchain\u201d dictionary definition is a waste of money, but whether one should write \u201conchain\u201d rather than \u201con-chain\u201d in a pitch to America\u2019s oldest dictionary publisher.\n\nBlockworks wasn\u2019t immune to the irresistible allure of this burning question. When I attempted to ask colleagues about their thoughts regarding on-chain vs onchain, the resulting opinions were so cacophonous I couldn\u2019t finish my sentence.\n\nEveryone seems to be sweating the little stuff rather than addressing the bigger issue: No one knows what the hell we\u2019re talking about most of the time.\n\nBecause crypto naming conventions are even sillier than Baby Gronk, the new Drip King, getting rizzed up by Livvy.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s baffling that crypto spends any time arguing about such matters when the names of some of the industry\u2019s most public-facing companies are just as confusing.\n\nTo list a few: Consensus, ConsenSys, BlockFi, Blockfolio, The Block, Blockworks (sorry), Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, Coinbase, Coingecko, CoinMarketCap\u2026you get the picture.\n\nWe weren\u2019t so smart about names in the beginning, and it\u2019s starting to catch up to us. With each new crypto innovation \u2014 Ordinals, Ethscriptions, staking, stacking, yield farming \u2014 we\u2019re actually moving further away from developing a lexicon that anyone besides us can actually understand.\n\nIn this fast-moving tech environment, it\u2019s crypto builders (rather than any linguists) who have the responsibility of naming new technologies. And they are failing.\n\nYes, there are few words and phrases that have successfully made it from the closed crypto inner sanctum to the mainstream. Last fall, Merriam Webster\u2019s new words list included metaverse, altcoin and unbanked.\n\nSo it\u2019s not too much of a longshot to imagine that onchain could actually make it in Merriam\u2019s next new words round (especially considering how unbanked also has no hyphen).\n\nWe just have to ask ourselves \u2014 how much does all this really matter?\n\nEven if we are somehow finally able to straighten things out and make some of these terms dictionary-official once and for all, we\u2019re still left with one linguistic mess after another. Like, how can a rollup be optimistic? Does it always have to have a cheerful disposition, or can it feel a little blue sometimes?\n\nCryptocurrency, and the various new inventions it brings, exists through the creation of a new language. And with the exception of a handful of cool Easter Egg names like market maker Wintermute (named after the sentient AI in William Gibson\u2019s sci-fi novel Neuromancer), crypto language is still in the stage of undecipherable inside baseball.\n\nIn fact, Merriam-Webster ironically doesn\u2019t even have the \u201ccorrect\u201d definition for the very word \u201ccrypto\u201d the way that the crypto industry uses it.\n\nFlip to the \u201cC\u201d section and you\u2019ll find this definition for crypto: \u201ca person who adheres or belongs secretly to a party, sect, or other group.\u201d\n\nHonestly, sounds about right.\n\nI don\u2019t care much about tech, I don\u2019t care a whole lot about finance, either. I care about writing stories and watching weird things unfold. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve ended up in crypto.\n\n\n\nBut because I\u2019m missing that passion for what crypto and blockchain are all about \u2014 finance, tech, privacy, yadda yadda \u2014 I\u2019m going to write instead about what I am actually interested in. Everything about crypto that has very little to do with crypto.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what this column will be about. All the tangential stories that come out of the blockchain and crypto space, what I think about them, and how I navigate it all as a skeptical former Russian literature major.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s precisely my perch as an outsider that lets me do what I do: Opine on all sides of any crypto issue, no strings attached, no skin in the game.\n\n\n\nIf you want to talk crypto with me, let\u2019s go off topic."

However, it now says the fund is \u201con track\u201d to launch this month, having decided that last year \u201cthe time wasn\u2019t right\u201d following the Terra Luna cryptocurrency crash in May 2022 and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse in November.\n\nThe asset manager says \u201cdemand has shifted since last summer\u201d.\n\nIn Europe all digital assets exchange traded products so far have been structured as exchange traded notes, rather than funds.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nEach ETF shareholder owns a portion of a fund\u2019s underlying shares, while investors in ETNs own a debt security, not the underlying assets.\n\nJacobi has made much of the fact that it is launching an ETF rather than an exchange traded note.\n\nPeter Lane, co-founder and chief operating officer of Jacobi, told Ignites Europe last year that structured note issuers were guilty of \u201cmisuse\u201d of the ETF term.\n\n\u201cThere has been so much misinformation and misuse of the term ETF by [ETN] issuers, presumably to obfuscate the risks that are inherent in acquiring and investing in ETNs,\u201d he said.\n\nJacobi said its ETF, unlike ETNs, cannot be leveraged or use derivatives, which could otherwise lead to \u201csignificant counterparty risk\u201d.\n\nThe fund has been authorised in Guernsey, a jurisdiction that offers \u201ca number of advantages\u201d to help the launch of a bitcoin fund, said David Crosland, a partner in offshore law firm Carey Olsen.\n\n\u201cAs a specialist fund servicing jurisdiction that is not subject to the inherent inflexibilities of being an EU member, Guernsey was able to move quickly to adapt to support this launch,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c[Guernsey\u2019s] flexibility and willingness to understand the complex detail has allowed the promoter to launch a fund vehicle that benefits from regulated fund status when other European jurisdictions are unable to do so,\u201d Crosland added.\n\nMichael O\u2019Riordan, founding partner of ETF and digital assets consultancy Blackwater Search and Advisory, said the regulatory challenges of launching a bitcoin ETF in Europe were \u201cvery large\u201d as bitcoin was not considered an eligible asset under Ucits rules.\n\n\u201cHowever, in practice, apart from some structural differences, the ETF and the ETP are quite similar,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs an industry, we have not done a good job at distinguishing each and as a result there is a lot of confusion in the market as to which is which,\u201d O\u2019Riordan added.\n\nNet flows into European digital assets ETPs over the past 18 months amounted to $483mn, including inflows of $398mn in the third quarter of 2022 alone, according to data from Coinbase and Bloomberg.\n\nAssets in European digital assets ETPs stand at \u20ac4.3bn, having peaked at \u20ac10.5bn at the end of 2021, according to Ignites Europe analysis of Morningstar data.\n\n*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "content": "00:00\n\nLet's talk, first of all, about the reason that you've had to move your target on Bitcoin back, $250,000, you now say, by 2025. What has been holding Bitcoin back you think the most? I wasn't when I predicted it because I was at 4000. So it's gone to 30,000 in that time. And I wasn't really expecting the U.S. bureaucracy to be this aggressive. And I thought that maybe they would be recognizing that they've got to compete with the rest of the world. They've got to provide a platform from which entrepreneurs can can flourish. And by having this regulation, by enforcement that the SCC has been professing and driving, it's really driving all the great entrepreneurs out. And I think that that is that has hurt the Bitcoin price. But but Bitcoin is here to stay. It's a great it's a great system, it's a great currency, it's a great way to operate. I can't wait until I can raise a fund all in Bitcoin, invest it all on Bitcoin. And my my portfolio companies all pay their employees and suppliers all in Bitcoin and have taxes all paid in Bitcoin and have the waterfall all fall into people's bitcoin wallets because then there's no accounting, there's no auditing, there's no bookkeeping. It's all done on the blockchain and it's all honest and it's all straight. And I think that that is going to be that's going to bring society to an anthropological leap forward. It's going to be an amazing time and I can't wait for it. I guess I thought that it was going to happen a little sooner than it did. I also thought retailers would recognize that they can save 2% by accepting Bitcoin, and I thought they'd recognize that sooner. But that hasn't happened yet, and I think it's going to happen about the right time, about the same time as that happening. And maybe we'll get my price target then. Tim, a lot of you know, a lot of the OG Bitcoiners have sort of given up on the transactional piece of it on the currency side of it, looking at it more as a store of wealth like digital gold, why are you still pushing that that use case and how would it work? Would you use the Lightning Network or some other software patch to make it faster and more efficient? Yeah, I think when people talk about using Bitcoin as a store of value and that that being the only use, what they're missing is that the Lightning Network can operate on chain. So all these people who talk about Bitcoin using too much energy or it's too slow or whatever, they're missing that. When you move it off to the Lightning Network and maybe with open Node or whatever, it can do 5000 transactions a second and it doesn't require a lot of energy. And and I think that as the software starts being built for the smart contracts on Bitcoin, when ETFs are more targeted toward Bitcoin, they're calling for calling them ordinal, not ETFs, foreign entities. Yes, there were a lot of credibility and BlackRock guys are going to be doing it, but the nav ts, one CnF, ts or ordinal become a part of Bitcoin. And when when it does start focusing around Bitcoin, I think you're going to start seeing the real flourishing of Bitcoin. And and I think FDX sent us a very strong message that we don't want centralized currencies of any kind and we don't want I mean, we don't want a central bank, we don't want centralized currencies of any kind because they can be controlled by one person and that one person can take us off a cliff."

        "content": "$30 trillion worth of capital could suddenly unlock for the Bitcoin market if a Bitcoin spot ETF is approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nThat is the estimated amount of assets controlled by financial advisors in the U.S., who would be willing to get exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated exchange-traded fund.\n\n\"ETF is the format in which the boomers and the financial advisors prefer their investments delivered in\u201d, Balchunas explained in an exclusive Cointelegraph interview.\n\nBlackrock's application for a Bitcoin spot ETF last month sparked a new wave of optimism around the crypto market which led other major firms such as ARK Investment, Valkyrie, and Fidelity to file their own applications for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe involvement of Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, was enough to raise the chances of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval from 1% to 50%, according to Balchunas.\n\n\"They're very smart and they don't just throw filings out willy nilly\u201d, the analyst said. \"They clearly see something out there that they think they can get through the regulators\u201d, he added.\n\nTo find out more about the implications of the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF filing, watch the full interview on our YouTube channel, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "title": "Mt. Gox repayment date looming: Is Bitcoin in trouble? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "While the cryptocurrency community is actively discussing the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024, another potentially big market event is happening this year.\n\nThe trustee of the hacked Bitcoin (BTC) exchange, Mt. Gox, is set to finally repay the exchange\u2019s creditors by the end of October 2023. If that happens, the cryptocurrency market could be significantly affected in several ways, some industry observers agree.\n\nFounded in 2010, Mt. Gox was once the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world, estimated to facilitate around 70% of all BTC transactions before its implosion.\n\nThe now-defunct exchange lost 850,000 BTC \u2014 4% of all Bitcoin to be issued \u2014 in a security breach in 2014. The event made Mt. Gox one of the biggest cryptocurrency bankruptcies of all time, with creditors yet to be repaid nine years later.\n\nAs the current Mt. Gox repayment deadline is scheduled to occur in roughly three months, Cointelegraph has reached out to some crypto executives to find out what to expect from the anticipated Mt. Gox repayment.\n\nWhat will the investors do once they get their Bitcoin back?\n\nThe repayment of Mt. Gox will be a unique event, which is certain to have a significant impact on the market, WhaleWire founder and CEO Jacob King believes.\n\nAfter losing all their Bitcoin almost 10 years ago, most creditors are likely to sell at least part of their BTC once they finally get it back, King told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cThis influx of sell orders could create a downward pressure on prices and potentially lead to a market downturn,\u201d he said. King also mentioned multiple prolonged delays in the Mt. Gox repayment process, which has already caused a sense of \u201cdisillusionment among investors, eroding their confidence in the market.\u201d\n\nThe WhaleWire CEO continued:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question of, what will the investors do? Over the last year, we\u2019ve seen more sells than buys, and many of those who lost on Mt. Gox have moved on past crypto. The chances they hold for more years, after everything that happened, is highly unlikely.\u201d\n\nSome of the Mt. Gox creditors themselves admit that the Bitcoin market may face some selling pressure once the repayment is done. However, many claimants are likely to continue to hodl, as one trader who described himself as a Mt. Gox creditor told Cointelegraph. He stated:\n\n\u201cWhen we get our coins, I think we\u2019re all going to hold. But when the news hits the world that these coins are going to be released, people who have coins but who are not the claimants are going to sell for fear of the price going down.\u201d\n\nHow much will be repaid?\n\nMt. Gox expects to repay a total of more than 10,000 crypto creditors from all over the world by the end of October. Despite the exchange losing 850,000 BTC, Mt. Gox will only repay part of the total losses from the hack because the firm could only recover some of the funds.\n\nAccording to online reports, Mt. Gox will reimburse its creditors 142,000 BTC ($4.3 billion) and 143,000 in forked cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), worth roughly $40 million. The bankrupt exchange will also reportedly pay out 69 billion Japanese yen ($510 million). Payments will be made using a combination of fiat currency and cryptocurrencies, with each payout coordinated individually with each investor.\n\nThe repayment of Mt. Gox funds will be a massive event, Whale Alert co-founder Frank Weert agrees. But the way it influences the market will depend much on how the funds are released and how the media report it, the exec told Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cWe are sure some will be glad to be able to finally cash out, but we doubt it will cause a massive sell-off,\u201d he stated. When asked whether the crypto industry has ever seen a similar event, Weert said that there hasn\u2019t ever been an event on such a scale so far.\n\nSome major creditors, including Bitcoinica and MtGox Investment Funds, reportedly chose to have their bankruptcy recovery funds paid out in Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to data from the Mt. Gox balance bot on Twitter, the Mt. Gox trustee holds 135,890 BTC on all known addresses at the time of writing.\n\nTotal current balance on all known addresses* of the MtGox Trustee: 135890.98002134 BTC.\n\n\n\n-0.00043187 BTC have been moved away from these addresses since 2018/05/10. $BTC #bitcoin #mtgox mt.gox mt gox\n\n\n\n2023-07-11T09:19:03.239Z UTC \u2014 MtGoxBalanceBot (@MtGoxBalanceBot) July 11, 2023\n\nMt. Gox Bitcoin repayment amount is close to Michael Saylor\u2019s BTC holdings\n\nWhile many crypto enthusiasts believe that Mt. Gox repayment will be a massive event, some skeptics are confident that any potential effects will likely subside quickly.\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin that is to be handed back to Mt. Gox creditors is comparable to the holdings of Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, who holds at least 152,333 BTC ($4.52 billion).\n\n\u201cEither way, it doesn\u2019t seem like a lot,\u201d Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan told Cointelegraph. Referring to the current worth of Bitcoin to be repaid, Greenspan emphasized that the current daily on-chain volumes are much bigger.\n\nRelated: $30B stolen from crypto ecosystem since 2012: Report\n\n\u201cDaily on-chain volumes are at an average of $12 billion, exchange volumes are reportedly in the neighborhood of $18 billion per day,\u201d he noted, adding:\n\n\u201cSo this is certainly something the market can absorb in a relatively short time frame. I would assume there may be some sell pressure due to the speculation around this event. Many people don\u2019t know basic math.\u201d\n\nGreenspan also stressed that Mt. Gox\u2019s Bitcoin will be distributed to lots of people, which could be very good for the network as a \u201cmass-distribution event.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of OGs that will be reactivated. Some of them will sell and wash their hands, but I bet many will be staunch advocates of self-custody,\u201d he added.\n\nThe exec also expressed optimism about the potential repayment, stating that Mt. Gox-related FUD has been \u201cplaguing the market\u201d for many years, and it will be \u201cgood to see it finally put to bed.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

Discover SCENE\n\nThe U.S. government is moving its Silk Road Bitcoin stash again.\n\nCrypto wallets belonging to the Department of Justice on Wednesday moved $300 million in BTC to new addresses in two transactions.\n\nThe feds hold Bitcoin that's been seized from criminals and sometimes move it around. In the past, they've done so because they intend to sell it\u2014but not always.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is likely this stash comes from its biggest seizure yet: In November 2021 cops took $3.36 billion in BTC after hacker James Zhong confessed to stealing digital assets from the illegal Silk Road marketplace.\n\nThe feds have since been selling the crypto bit by bit; in March, they sold $215 million-worth of the \"digital gold.\" At the time, they said they plan to dump another $1.1 billion.\n\nSilk Road was an online black market which mostly sold illegal drugs before authorities shut it down in 2014.\n\nJames Zhong pleaded guilty last year to wire fraud after the government alleged that he manipulated the Silk Road transaction system in 2012 to pocket 50,676 Bitcoins.\n\nHe kept the stash hidden for 10 years until it ballooned to a value of $3.3 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday's movements show that the government-controlled wallets sent a total of 9,825 Bitcoin\u2014worth $301 million at today's prices.\n\nThe crypto community tends to keep an eye on big and well-known BTC holders because when they move large amounts of funds, it impacts the price of the asset, according to experts.\n\nPrevious movements\u2014or even suspected movements\u2014have sent the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap into a nosedive. The price of BTC briefly dropped at 8:30am New York time, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThe asset has since climbed again and was at the time of writing trading for $30,777 per coin, a 0.8% 24-hour rise."

        "title": "What Will Make MicroStrategy Sell its Bitcoin, and Would it Crash the Market? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\n\n\nAn investor\u2019s note from Bernstein note that MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC strategy comes with risk.\n\nMicroStrategy holds over 150,000 BTC used as collateral for loans.\n\nAn extreme market crash could pressure the company to sell if it has to fulfill debt obligations.\n\nAn investor\u2019s note from private wealth management firm Bernstein has unpacked a potential scenario that would force MicroStrategy to sell some of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe business intelligence firm has been converting most of its corporate treasury to Bitcoin (BTC) in a move led by CEO Michael Saylor over the past two years. The company holds over 150,000 BTC, valued at $4.5 billion, of which some tokens have been used as collateral for loans.\n\nAccording to Bernstein\u2019s note, which has grabbed headlines, MicroStrategy plans to continue raising debt into the future, which could lead to a potential scenario where it would have to liquidate its BTC holdings. This would require \u201cextreme price corrections\u201d coinciding with the company\u2019s debt expiry in 2025.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would see the value of MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC holdings fall below its debt obligations. This would lead to its corporate structure coming under pressure from \u2018spring forward\u2019 clauses.\n\n\u201c2028 due debt does have liquidity covenants which could spring forward the debt to 2025/26\u201d, the report added.\n\nAdopting Bitcoin\n\nMicroStrategy is somewhat of a trailblazer for the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Saylor initiated the firm\u2019s BTC acquisition strategy after announcing the company would convert its treasury to Bitcoin in 2020.\n\nThe company would go on a spree of Bitcoin investing, starting with a $250 million buy order for 21,454 BTC in August 2020. The company now holds over 152,000 BTC as of July 2023, valued at $4.5 billion at an average price of $29,600.\n\nMicroStrategy also announced a $1.05 billion loan in February 2021 that matures in 2027 that it used to continue its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. This is part of the debt the company is carrying that could lead to a potential sell-off scenario which Bernstein has highlighted.\n\nWould MicroStrategy Crash Bitcoin Price?\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are significant for a single entity and exceed the 142,000 BTC owed to creditors of the infamous, defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox.\n\nAs CCN previously explored, there has been similar speculation about the potential impact of the return of the 142,000 BTC to former Mt. Gox\u2019s users and whether that amount of liquidity would drive Bitcoin\u2019s value down.\n\nQuantum Economics founder and seasoned cryptocurrency market analyst Mati Greenspan said that the value of Mt. Gox\u2019s BTC is not even as significant as daily trading volumes:\n\n\u201cDaily on-chain volumes are at an average of $12 billion, and exchange volumes are reportedly in the neighborhood of $18 billion per day. So this is certainly something the market can absorb in a relatively short time frame.\u201d\n\nWhile the comments were aimed at Mt. Gox creditors BTC holdings, the fairly similar value provides a good measuring of what would transpire if MicroStrategy were to sell some BTC."

        "title": "Grayscale calls out SEC over spot bitcoin ETF denials - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Several large investment managers have recently submitted applications to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale Investments has been trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF since 2016 and has yet to get approval. Now, its calling out the Securities and Exchange Commission over its approval of a leveraged bitcoin futures ETF. Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein joints Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his company's efforts to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, Bitcoin has soared over the last month on hopes that regulators are going to finally approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. We're looking at gains of just about almost 17% in the price of Bitcoin getting a boost after BlackRock filed paperwork with the SEC last month sparking a new wave of optimism and several institutions followed.\n\nWhile Grayscale has been trying to get approval for a spot market ETF since 2016, its last request was denied. Now the company is calling out the SEC. For more on this, we want to bring in Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale Investments CEO.\n\nMichael, it's great to see you. And I want to bring up the letter that you recently sent. And we have a full screen here to show exactly what you are laying out. You sent a letter to the DC Court of Appeals questioning the SEC's decision to approve a leveraged Bitcoin future ETF after previously denying a spot Bitcoin ETF. So lay out your case here and why these two decisions don't add up.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Absolutely. Well, it's great to be back on the show. I would say that this really comes down to the core argument. When the SEC denied our application to convert GBTC into an ETF, we immediately filed a lawsuit challenging that decision.\n\nAnd the argument that really underpins that is that the SEC has approved, not one, but several Bitcoin futures-based ETFs-- futures are a derivative of that underlying spot market-- but continued to deny, including GBTC, spot Bitcoin applications from coming to market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd those arguments were presented to the court. We believe that they're common sense and compelling arguments. But the SEC now has gone on and continued to even go further into this arbitrary behavior by now approving a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF which, in the actual prospectus itself, outlines that that's an even riskier product, right?\n\nAnd so we do feel here that investors should have choice, right? They should be able to use Bitcoin futures ETFs. They should be able to use spot Bitcoin ETFs, really whatever's going to fit their mandate as an investor.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Michael, why do you think the SEC has been so reluctant. I mean, what's your read on what is driving or what's motivating the SEC to put the brake?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I can really only point to what they've said in their denials, right? The SEC has been looking for a market that is surveyable, a market that maybe has the qualities and characteristics of other markets that they're used to seeing.\n\nThat being said, there are new conversations being had around surveillance-sharing agreements and other types of constructs that maybe the SEC will be persuaded by, but time, I think, will tell.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Michael, many though are looking at the approval of the leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF as a positive step forward given the fact that then maybe this makes it a little bit more likely that the SEC is going to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, do you share in that view?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I think there's been a recent wave of ETF applications that have come in and part of that optimism really does revolve around the GBTC lawsuit. We've been transparent with the market that we expect a decision from the court sometime. It could be as soon as over the next few weeks, but probably by the fall the latest.\n\nAnd so there's a lot of issuers that have been looking at-- Not only has GBTC kind of laid the groundwork and become a place where many investors have gotten their Bitcoin exposure, but it's now the framework upon which they're basing their operations, their disclosure, et cetera. So they believe that that, in fact, could be a catalyst if a favorable outcome is reached, there.\n\nAnd it continues to show that investor interest and appetite for this asset class isn't going away and the continuation of Bitcoin futures, Bitcoin-leveraged futures ETFs, these are all additional access points that investors now have.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Michael, it's been what? More than eight months now since we saw really just the collapse of FTX. And there were a lot of concerns, conversations around that time about what the future of crypto will look like.\n\nI mean, you've got institutional names now trying to get in with the spot Bitcoin ETF and really the opportunity is there as well. But what do you think has evolved in the thinking within the crypto space and does that ultimately strengthen the case for investment into something like Bitcoin?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: You know, it's great to think about that timeline in perspective, because you're right. It was only six, eight months ago that the narrative around crypto was that it was being left for dead or it was a passing fad or investors were fleeing it. And what we've said is it's actually quite the opposite.\n\nYou know, this is my and Grayscale's third crypto winter. And we've continued to reiterate. It's a great time to build. And it's a time when crypto gets challenged and really demonstrates its resiliency. And so you've seen continued optimism, additional institutional investors coming to the space.\n\nAnd assets like Bitcoin are some of the highest returning assets of the year. And so it really does show the staying power of the asset class and that additional narrative from some of these incumbent legacy financial institutions is a really important construct for investors to keep in mind as well.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Michael, we do see the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF. How much of-- is that a game changer here for the industry just in terms of wider adoption and given the fact that many investors, you would think, want maybe some exposure to crypto, but they're more comfortable going that ETF route?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Exactly. I think the ETF wrapper is a tried-and-true product model that investors are used to for commodities, segments of the market, et cetera. And I think all of the issuers filing know there's a lot of pent-up demand.\n\nAnd so whether you're looking at GBTC or any of the other products looking to come to market, there are trillions of dollars on the sideline-- even just in the financial advisor market-- that are looking for a convenient solution to give their clients exposure to Bitcoin, so we do think it could be a material moment for Bitcoin to say the least.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: OK. To be continued there. Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein, good to have you on today.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Thank you."

        "title": "Mt. Gox Repayment Coming in October: What Will Happen to Bitcoin Price - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMt. Gox creditors are set to receive payouts in October 2023.\n\n142,000 BTC, currently worth $4.3 billion, are set to return to general circulation.\n\nAnalysts believe it could influence the market price of Bitcoin.\n\nIn just three months\u2019 time, $4.3 billion worth of Bitcoin is set to be paid out to creditors of the defunct, infamous Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe trustee in charge of recouping funds from the exchange closed final creditor registration in preparation for the reimbursement of user BTC holdings in April 2023. A statement from attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi tipped October 31 for the processing of some payments to creditors.\n\nSome 20,000 creditors are looking to receive funds that were lost in the collapse of Mt. Gox, which became the most infamous cryptocurrency exchange failure between 2010 and 2020 before the likes of FTX imploded.\n\nTotal current balance on all known addresses* of the MtGox Trustee: 135890.98002134 BTC. -0.00043187 BTC have been moved away from these addresses since 2018/05/10. $BTC #bitcoin #mtgox mt.gox mt gox 2023-07-11T09:19:03.239Z UTC \u2014 MtGoxBalanceBot (@MtGoxBalanceBot) July 11, 2023\n\nWhile an official number is yet to be confirmed by Mt. Gox , an estimated 142,000 BTC are held by the trust, valued at around $4.3 billion as of July 2023. Twitter bot MtGoxBalanceBot tips the known addresses of the Mt. Gox trustee to hold 135,890 BTC.\n\nGiven the substantial amount of Bitcoin set to be repaid to creditors, as well as the significant appreciation in the value of the holdings of Mt. Gox users since the exchange went defunct, a potential offloading of recouped BTC onto various exchanges is touted to influence the price of Bitcoin later this year.\n\nTotal Repayment Less Than BTC\u2019s Daily Trading Volume\n\nThe biggest talking point ahead of the looming Mt. Gox creditor payout is the potential price impact the event will have on Bitcoin across the world. As initially reported by Cointelegraph, some analysts believe that the repayment program might not be as influential as it is being made out to be.\n\nQuantum Economics founder and seasoned cryptocurrency market analyst Mati Greenspan said that the amount of BTC that is set to be returned simply pales in comparison to present-day trading activity.\n\n\u201cSome will HODL. Some will sell. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t really matter since the total Mt. Gox repayment is marginally less than BTC\u2019s daily trading volume,\u201d Greenspan wrote on Twitter.\n\nSome will HODL. Some will sell. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter since the total Mt. Gox repayment is marginally less than BTC's daily trading volume. Thanks @coindanslecoin for including my quote, and I'd like to reiterate\u2026 \"most people don't know basic math.\" https://t.co/s6cgvbtaYV \u2014 MatiGreenspan.sats (@MatiGreenspan) July 11, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, analysts from the popular YouTube channel CryptoBanter suggest that cryptocurrency markets take a bearish turn in the lead-up to the Mt. Gox repayment date, the potential for a sizable portion of BTC being sold off on markets might have a compounding negative effect on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nEXPECT A 30% Bitcoin & 50% Altcoin DUMP IF THIS PLAYS OUT! https://t.co/R0UPOqNsaw \u2014 Crypto Banter (@crypto_banter) July 10, 2023\n\n22,500 Creditors Recognized, Claims Amount to $18.6 billion BTC\n\nA report published by Blockchain Research Lab (BRL) in August 2022 highlights that a total of 22,560 individual creditors were recognized by the Mt. Gox trustee.\n\n20,658 of the creditors have made claims in BTC while 11,868 made fiat currency claims. The report tipped the claims to be valued at $18.6 billion in BTC and Bitcoin Cash as well as $48 million in US dollars.\n\nInterestingly, Mt. Gox founder Mark Karpeles indicated that the exchange had 1.1 million active accounts in 2013, meaning that only 2.1% of all active accounts filed and received claims.\n\nBRL suggests that many accounts might not have had substantial holdings at the time of Mt. Gox\u2019s bankruptcy filing as a possible reason for this low percentage.\n\nThe report also noted that the average claim for Mt. Gox Bitcoin creditors is ~39 BTC, which is valued at $1.1 million as of July 2023. Creditors can expect to receive double that amount, given that they\u2019ll receive an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) tokens following the hard fork of the latter blockchain from the Bitcoin core network."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Tuesday morning trading in Asia to hold above US$30,000, helped by U.K. bank Standard Chartered Plc predicting the token will reach US$120,000 by the end of 2024. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also moved higher, with Polygon\u2019s Matic token spearheading the rally. U.S. equity futures also gained in the Asia time zone on Tuesday after Federal Reserve officials said the bank\u2019s monetary tightening cycle is drawing to a close.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin gained 0.79% over the last 24 hours to US$30,392 as of 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently fluctuated around the US$30,000 line but prices turned softer late last week on mixed signals about the likelihood of approval for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds. The token is still sitting on a weekly loss of 2.35%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nHowever, some optimism returned to Bitcoin\u2019s pricing outlook after Standard Chartered bank predicted in a Monday report the token would reach US$50,000 by the end of 2023 and US$120,000 at the end of the following year, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event to take place next April, scarcer Bitcoin supply could drive up prices and in turn prompt miners to hoard the token, the Standard Chartered report said. \u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAnother plus for prices: cryptocurrency-linked investment products saw net inflows of US$136 million in the week ending July 7, marking the third consecutive week of inflows and fully correcting the prior nine weeks of outflows, according to European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares on Monday.\n\n\u201cBitcoin remains the focus amongst investors, with inflows totalling US$133m last week, while short-bitcoin saw outflows of US$1.8m, its 11th consecutive week, further demonstrating investors favour the asset over altcoins at present,\u201d wrote CoinShares in the report.\n\nEther rose 1.00% to US$1,880, but like Bitcoin it\u2019s coming off softer prices and is still down 3.80% for the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged gains in the past 24 hours with the exception of Dogecoin and Solana\u2019s SOL, which both dipped but the declines were within 0.5%.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic led the winners, jumping 6.97% to US$0.7356 and adding 3.33% for the week. \u201cSome positive on-chain signs for the 12th ranked market cap asset include rebounding network growth, decreasing supply on exchanges, and low profit taking,\u201d said crypto data tracker Santiment in a tweet on early Tuesday, adding the token is on a \u201cmini-run.\u201d\n\nMatic\u2019s recent run up comes as Polygon Labs unveiled its Polygon 2.0 roadmap on June 30, vowing to become the \u201cValue Layer of the Internet\u201d and on Friday appointed the firm\u2019s former chief legal officer Marc Boiron as its new Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHowever, the token has had a rough ride in 2023, down about 2%, and has plenty of ground to make up on peers such as Solana, which has jumped 115% so far this year. Polkadot has gained 18% in the same period\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization moved up 0.81% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume surged 70.03% to US$33.54 billion.\n\nNFT volumes skid amid low floor prices\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.20% in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,745.16. Forkast\u2019s Solana, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indices also fell, while Ethereum\u2019s index rose.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 9.41% to US$25.36 million, according to Cryptoslam data. The volume on the Ethereum blockchain dropped 2.39% to US$15.67 million, while Bitcoin volume fell 39.97% to US$4.22 million.\n\n\u201cPrimarily a red or even day across collections in regards to floor prices,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cTraders seem to be out of liquidity and most are accepting the idea that the NFT market will continue to decline.\u201d\n\nBy collection, trading volume in Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection topped the list, edging up 2.96% to US$2.16 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. The Bitcoin-based $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs and uncategorized Ordinals inscriptions ranked the second and the third.\n\nThe floor prices of BAYC and Mutant Ape Yacht Club edged higher in the past 24 hours, while Azuki and the Captainz moved around 1% lower. All four NFT collections have seen their floor prices slide 20% to 60% in the past month, according to data from NFT analytics platform WGMI.io.\n\nBlur Blend, the NFT lending platform of NFT marketplace Blur.io, started to support Azuki Elementals and Elemental Beans on Tuesday. The two NFT collections are spin-offs of Chiru Labs\u2019 Azuki, which have been criticized by some holders for being too similar to the original Azuki collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki Elementals and Elemental Beanz were both added to Blur\u2019s Blend lending protocol, and both saw their prices decrease as traders sold possibly to exit farmed collections,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cPerhaps they sense fear of further floor price decreases with gamified trading.\u201d\n\nAn end to rate hikes?\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, following on from gains in all three major U.S. indexes in regular Monday trading.\n\nU.S. equities received a boost from comments by several Federal Reserve officials on Monday, indicating that while more interest rate hikes are needed to curb inflation, the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening cycle is drawing to an end, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMy view is that the funds rate will need to move up somewhat further from its current level and then hold there for a while as we accumulate more information on how the economy is evolving,\u201d said Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta J. Mester on Monday. The Fed was \u201ccloser to the end of our tightening phase than the beginning,\u201d she added.\n\nMost main stock indexes across Asia benefited from the optimism on Wall Street, with China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all moving higher on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Citigroup downgraded the outlook for U.S. stocks to neutral on Monday on expectations for a retreat in growth stocks and a recession in the fourth quarter of the year, according to Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for June comes out Wednesday, offering the latest insight into the pace of U.S. inflation. Financial giants including BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are also set to report their second-quarter earnings this week.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on July 26 to make its next move on interest rates, which now sit between 5% and 5.25%, The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase this month, and a 7.6% chance for the Fed to leave the rate unchanged.\n\nIn China, the People\u2019s Bank of China and National Financial Regulatory Administration said in a joint statement on Monday they would take measures to stabilize the country\u2019s property industry, which include encouraging financial institutions to extend property firms\u2019 outstanding loans through negotiations. The signal was welcomed by investors and drove up shares of property developers, according to Bloomberg on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, July 11, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ault Alliance, Inc. (NYSE American: AULT), a diversified holding company, (\"Ault Alliance\" or the \"Company\"), announced today that it plans to explore a pathway that will allow it to issue a special dividend payable in Bitcoin to stockholders. The Company intends to collaborate with regulatory authorities, its transfer agent and others, which may include a trusted custodian, to determine what is required in order to pay a special dividend in Bitcoin.\n\nThe planned dividend would be paid from Bitcoin generated by the Company\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, BitNile, Inc. (\"BNI\"). As previously announced, BNI issued an unaudited update on its Bitcoin mining operations reporting BNI\u2019s mining operations is currently operating at an operational hash rate of 2.1 exahashes per second with approximately 9,000 of its Bitcoin miners at its Michigan data center and 10,000 Bitcoin miners that are being hosted through its strategic collaboration with Core Scientific, Inc. The annualized gross value of Bitcoin currently being mined utilizing BNI\u2019s miners is more than $55 million, or approximately 1,800 Bitcoin, based on current market conditions, including a current trading price of Bitcoin at $30,400 and a mining difficulty of 50.65 trillion.\n\nAult Alliance remains dedicated to its core mission of driving innovation and delivering exceptional value to its stockholders. With the increasing popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies, Ault Alliance recognizes the potential of Bitcoin as a valuable asset for its stockholders. The idea of potentially issuing a Bitcoin dividend is aimed at providing a forward-thinking approach to stockholder value enhancement. By leveraging its Bitcoin mining operations, Ault Alliance seeks to provide an alternative investment opportunity and potential long-term value appreciation for its stockholders.\n\nAult Alliance is also exploring ways to facilitate the effectuation of its conceptual design for stockholders who may not be familiar or comfortable with receiving a dividend in Bitcoin itself. Ault Alliance would, with the intention of addressing the preferences of all of its stockholders, accomplish this objective by offering its stockholders as of the ex-dividend date a choice of receiving actual Bitcoin or a cash payment equal to the dollar value of the Bitcoin as of such ex-dividend date.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"By exploring a possible Bitcoin dividend, we aim to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and provide additional value to our stockholders,\" said Milton \"Todd\" Ault III, Founder and Executive Chairman of Ault Alliance. \"We believe that cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, hold tremendous potential for the future, and we want our stockholders to benefit from this exciting opportunity.\"\n\nIn order to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and promote transparency, Ault Alliance will be working closely with relevant regulatory authorities throughout the process. The Company is committed to adhering to the highest standards of corporate governance and regulatory compliance in all its operations. At this time, the Company has not declared a dividend and there can be no assurances that it will declare a dividend payable in Bitcoin or a Bitcoin-denominated cash payment, if at all. The Company has not yet determined what procedures would be required to permit stockholders to receive a dividend in Bitcoin, and even if the Company is able to pay a special dividend in Bitcoin, there are no guarantees that all stockholders will be permitted by their local governmental bodies to receive the dividend in Bitcoin.\n\nAult Alliance notes that all estimates and other projections are subject to the volatility in Bitcoin market price, the fluctuation in the mining difficulty level, the ability to build out and provide the necessary power for miners, and other factors that may impact the results of Bitcoin mining production or operations.\n\nFor more information on Ault Alliance and its subsidiaries, Ault Alliance recommends that stockholders, investors, and any other interested parties read Ault Alliance\u2019s public filings and press releases available under the Investor Relations section at https://www.ault.com/ or available at https://www.sec.gov/.\n\nAbout Ault Alliance, Inc.\n\nAult Alliance, Inc. is a diversified holding company pursuing growth by acquiring undervalued businesses and disruptive technologies with a global impact.

        "content": "In the latest episode of The Market Report, Cointelegraph analyst and writer Marcel Pechman discusses Standard Chartered bank\u2019s $120,000 Bitcoin price expectation based on the halving impact. According to the report, increased miner profitability due to a pre-halving rally would \u201creduce the net BTC supply.\u201d\n\nPechman, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t acknowledge the thesis, given that the mining difficulty will continue to increase and the news confirming Riot Platform\u2019s investment in new ASIC equipment. In fact, the mining difficulty increased by 73% in the last 12 months, while the Bitcoin (BTC) price increased by 58%.\n\nRegarding the $50,000 Bitcoin year-end price prediction, Pechman believes the number is too optimistic, given the low odds of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by then. However, if the ETF is approved within the next six months, an estimated $5 billion potential inflow could catapult Bitcoin\u2019s price above $70,000.\n\nFor 2024, Pechman increases his odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval to 30%, while Bloomberg analysts expect even higher chances at 50%. Given the sheer size of BlackRock and Fidelity, Pechman believes a $10 billion inflow in the first couple of months following the ETF launch is feasible, suggesting Standard Chartered\u2019s $120,000 expectation could be on the conservative side.\n\nThe expectation of an ETF approval may impact the pre-halving rally, according to Pechman, who also explains why investors may be anticipating the movement. Consequently, the pre-halving effect may get longer or shorter if investors dump before the event happens. Pechman\u2019s recommendation is to avoid the fear of missing out or FOMO. If you missed an entry spot, traders should either wait for the dollar cost average or sit and wait.\n\nLastly, Pechman analyzes the latest Glassnode on-chain analysis report on re-accumulation at $30,000. According to Pechman, \u201creturn to mean\u201d is also widespread in traditional markets. When investors are lost without the necessary conviction to move the price, they will refer to the previous two-year or three-year average levels.\n\nTo hear more about Pechman\u2019s strategy for the Bitcoin halving and the impact of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, listen to The Market Report, exclusively on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining difficulty reached an all-time high of 53.91 trillion units after the latest difficulty adjustment on July 12. It is a measure of how difficult it is to mine Bitcoin (BTC) blocks.\n\nThe blockchain adjusts its difficulty every two weeks to maintain its processing time of 10 minutes. When the network\u2019s processing power increases, it adjusts to make mining challenging, reducing the profitability for individual miners.\n\nThe latest adjustment will add to the pressure on miners, who have been selling off their mined BTC since June. Some analysts suspect that the lack of miner accumulation has likely restricted an uptrend in the BTC price.\n\nWith the latest difficulty adjustment, the profitability of medium- and small-scale miners will likely drop into negative territory, forcing them to temporarily turn off some of their ASIC hardware.\n\nThe potential capitulation of weaker miners could finally enable larger miners to accumulate Bitcoin, which may reduce the mining selling pressure.\n\nAre miners close to capitulation?\n\nThe hash ribbon indicator, created by independent analyst Charles Edwards, tracks the 30- and 60-day moving averages (MAs) of the network\u2019s hash rate. When the 30-day MA falls below the 60-day MA, it is a signal that miner capitulation may be occurring, meaning unprofitable miners are moving out.\n\nThe two lines are marginally close to a crossover, and the increase in difficulty may finally provide the catalyst for the capitulation of weaker miners.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart with the hash ribbon indicator. Source: TradingView\n\nThe exodus of weaker miners would bring more rewards for the more efficient miners, potentially allowing them to save a portion of their output instead of selling.\n\nCan Bitcoin push higher after miner selling ceases?\n\nRecently, miners were seen unloading record amounts of BTC to exchanges. According to a K33 Research report, publicly listed miners sold 100% or more of their output in May.\n\nMonthly updates on Bitcoin sold by public miners in 2022. Source: K33 Research\n\nIn June and July, as well, the 30-day cumulative transfer volume of BTC from miner wallets to exchanges spiked to a six-year peak, suggesting that miners likely continued to unload their Bitcoin at an alarming rate.\n\n30-day cumulative volumes of BTC transferred from miners to exchanges. Source: Bitcoin Magazine\n\nThe one-hop supply of miners from Coin Metrics, which represents the total amount held in wallets that received coins from mining pools, also dipped to one-year lows. It shows that miners have been uploading more coins than their production output.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin\u2019s pre-halving rally may start soon \u2014 Here\u2019s why\n\nOne-hop supply of miners. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nWhile miners have resorted to selling, the supply distribution data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment shows that Bitcoin whales did the opposite.\n\nThe most prolific BTC investors, often known as whales and sharks and marked by addresses holding between 10 to 10,000 BTC, have increased their holdings by $2.15 billion since June 17.\n\nOn top of that, Bitcoin held by exchanges has fallen below 2017 levels, suggesting that investors are moving the BTC off exchanges and that Bitcoin's illiquid supply is growing.\n\nWhile the accumulation of Bitcoin among whales has previously pushed the price of BTC higher, this time, it has remained suppressed in a narrow range between $29,500 and $31,500, which could partially be due to miner selling pressure.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Hut 8's Bitcoin production for the period equated to an average daily production rate of approximately 3.7 BTC. This figure marked a modest increase from the 103 Bitcoins mined in August.

This decline has led analysts to question the profitability of Bitcoin mining, especially in the face of challenges like increasing competition and regulatory changes.\n\nHut 8's Q2 revenue plummeted from USD $44 million in the same period last year to USD $19 million, marking a steep decline of 56% year-over-year. This is a reflection of the company's struggles during the quarter. In addition, the company's Bitcoin mining output saw a significant reduction of 58%, with only 399 Bitcoins mined in the quarter.\n\nHut 8 faced various operational challenges during the quarter that contributed to its revenue and mining output decline. The company reported a drop in profit from mining operations, which drastically fell from USD $14.9 million in the second quarter of 2022 to USD $3.2 million."

        "title": "Better Bitcoin Stock: Riot Platforms vs. Marathon Digital - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%) and Marathon Digital (MARA -2.43%) are two of the largest pure play Bitcoin (BTC -0.11%) miners in America. Both stocks hit their all-time highs in 2021 as Bitcoin's price skyrocketed, but they stumbled over the past two years as rising interest rates crushed the cryptocurrency market.\n\nI compared these two stocks last June and called Riot the better buy because it faced fewer regulatory headwinds and had a healthier balance sheet. Riot's stock has risen nearly 150% since then, while Marathon's stock has advanced about 80%. Let's see why Riot outperformed Marathon -- and if it's still the better bet on the Bitcoin market.\n\nSimilar business models, similar challenges\n\nRiot and Marathon weren't originally Bitcoin miners. Riot was once a medical device maker called Bioptix, while Marathon was originally a patent holding company. Both companies abandoned those original business models, ordered thousands of top-tier Antminers from Bitmain, and rebranded themselves as pure play Bitcoin miners.\n\nRiot had deployed 95,904 miners by the end of June, which gave it a total hash rate capacity (or the overall efficiency of its mining operations) of 10.7 EH/s (exahashes per second). Just over a year ago, it had claimed it could deploy 120,150 miners to generate a total hash rate capacity of 12.8 EH/s by January 2023.\n\nMarathon had deployed 149,900 miners as of July 1, with a total hash rate capacity of 17.7 EH/s. However, that also missed its own target of deploying 199,000 miners to generate a total hash rate capacity of 23.3 EH/s by \"early 2023.\"\n\nRiot and Marathon both adopted a more conservative approach toward expanding their mining fleets as rising interest rates made Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related stocks a lot less appealing. Adverse weather conditions also boosted energy prices in recent months and forced both companies to mine fewer Bitcoins -- even as Bitcoin's price rose by 40% over the past 12 months. From May to June, Riot and Marathon mined 32% and 21% fewer Bitcoins, respectively, on a month-over-month basis.\n\nAfter initially hoarding their mined Bitcoins, both companies started to liquidate some of them to raise fresh cash over the past year. In June, Riot sold 400 of the 460 Bitcoins it mined, while Marathon sold 700 of its 979 mined Bitcoins.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2023, Riot held $129 million in unrestricted cash and $202 million in Bitcoin on its balance sheet, while Marathon held $114 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $380 million in Bitcoin holdings.\n\nMarathon still has the same old weaknesses\n\nRiot and Marathon seem fundamentally similar, but only Marathon is being actively probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2021, the SEC started to probe Marathon's joint venture with Beowulf Energy, which had been established to secure favorable energy rates for its data centers in Hardin, Montana. The SEC took issue with Marathon's usage of its own restricted shares instead of cash to fund that deal. This May, Marathon disclosed that it had received another SEC subpoena related to that joint venture. If Marathon is forced to end its partnership with Beowulf, its energy costs could surge.\n\nMarathon also ended its latest quarter with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.3, mainly due to the $733 million in convertible notes on its balance sheet, while Riot had a much lower ratio of 0.1. That higher leverage could make Marathon less appealing in this volatile market.\n\nBoth companies racked up steep losses last year\n\nRiot's revenue surged from $12 million in 2020 to $213 million in 2021, then grew another 22% to $259 million in 2022. However, its net loss widened from $14 million in 2020 to $15 million in 2021, then ballooned to $510 million as the crypto winter dragged on and energy costs soared. But for 2023, analysts expect its revenue to rise 46% to $379 million as it narrows its net loss to $146 million.\n\nMarathon's revenue soared from $4 million in 2020 to $159 million in 2021, but declined 26% to $118 million in 2022. Its net loss more than tripled from $10 million in 2020 to $37 million in 2021, then widened to a staggering $687 million in 2022. But on the bright side, analysts expect Marathon's revenue to more than triple to $424 million in 2023 as it brings two new plants online and launches a new joint venture in Abu Dhabi. It's also expected to generate a net profit of $33 million.\n\nThat ambitious expansion -- funded by a lot of the cash it raised through its recent convertible note offerings -- could offset many of its aforementioned weaknesses.\n\nThe valuations and verdict\n\nRiot trades at seven times this year's sales, while Marathon has a lower ratio of 6. I'd rather directly buy Bitcoin than either of these capital-intensive Bitcoin miners right now, but Marathon is still a better pick than Riot for four simple reasons. It's holding more Bitcoin, it has a bigger fleet of miners, it's executing bolder expansion plans, and its stock is cheaper."

A breakout either way is very likely in the coming days as July awaits several macro events, [including] the U.S. Consumer Price Index and the U.S. Producer Price Index this week followed by the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision in the last week of July,\u201d Minal Thukral, executive vice-president of growth and strategy at CoinDCX, India\u2019s first crypto unicorn, told Forkast in an emailed response on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe can expect volatility coming in the second half of July with the upcoming events and BTC mostly staying range bound since last week,\u201d Thukral added.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank on Monday projected Bitcoin prices would reach US$50,000 by the end of 2023 and US$120,000 in 2024.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Bitcoin halving has proven to be the biggest driver for the start of a bull run as this happens every four years where the supply for Bitcoin reduces by 50%, increasing demand which leads to price rise,\u201d Thukral said.\n\nThe next halving is scheduled for April next year, with the pre-halving buildup already reflecting the Bitcoin price increase.\n\nBitcoin prices also received a boost after several traditional finance (TradFi) companies, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise, filed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. last month.\n\n\u201cAlthough the approval is still pending with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, if approved this will make it easier for mass adoption for users,\u201d Thukral said.\n\n\u201cOver-the-counter (OTC) trading reached a one-year high in June, surging by 60% in the past quarter alone. These OTC trading deals are now more popular with institutional investors, indicating BTC is becoming a preferred investment option,\u201d he added.\n\nDigital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia said on Wednesday that its analysis of global exchange traded products (ETPs) with digital assets as underlying collateral, has expanded by 76% in assets under management (AUM) year-to-date amid renewed interest by investors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an upward trend so far this year, and that\u2019s attracting capital,\u201d Fineqia chief executive Bundeep Singh Rangar said in an emailed statement. \u201cRecent ETF filings in the U.S. signals a revival of interest among financial institutions.\u201d\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency, gained 0.35% to US$1,889 in the past 24 hours, but dropped 2.38% on the week.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with BNB \u2013 the native token of world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance \u2013 gaining the most. BNB rose 1% to US$249 in the past 24 hours and gained 2.64% on the week.\n\nKTX.Finance, a decentralized perpetuals exchange on BNB Chain, said on Tuesday it has raised US$4 million seed round financing led by Hashed. Other participants in the round include AlphaLab Capital, CRIT Ventures, KuCoin Ventures, among others. KTX.Finance \u2013 incubated by ByteTrade Lab \u2013 went live last month on BNB Chain and said it has achieved US$40 million in trading volume from more than 600 traders.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 0.66% to US$1.2 trillion while market volume decreased 19.9% to US$26.45 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nNew Ethereum-based collections gain\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.04% to 2,704.29 in 24 hours to 6.25 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 2.6%.\n\nIn the same period, the Forkast ETH NFT Composite slipped 0.1% to 929.15, after losing 1.51% on the week.\n\nTotal sales volume on Ethereum declined 5.41% to US$14.98 million while those on the Bitcoin network fell 41.61% to US$3.12 million in the past 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nBy collection, the Bitcoin-based $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs topped the list but fell 12.57% to US$1.84 million. Parallel Avatars, an Ethereum-based NFT collection for Web3 sci-fi game Parallel, launched on July 11, ranked second with its sales volume rising 94.77% to US$1.59 million.\n\nStation3 Patron, another newly-launched Ethereum NFT collection, ranked fifth with its 24-hour sales volume rising 71.32% to US$902,779.\n\n\u201cAmong the current use cases of NFT, while collectibles is still finding its feet, there are other use cases that show more sticky traction. Sorare NFTs are used as part of game play (fantasy sports) and have shown considerable sticky volumes and traction,\u201d said Thukral of CoinDCX.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is cracking down on NFT scams. Moroccan national Soufiane Oulahyane has been indicted by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York for allegedly creating a lookalike of NFT marketplace OpenSea to obtain unauthorized access to cryptocurrency and NFTs. In September 2021, Oulahyane stole approximately US$450,000 worth of cryptocurrency and NFTs from a victim in Manhattan, according to a Monday statement by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nU.S. stock futures, European bourses gain; Asian equities mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equity markets were mixed on Wednesday, ahead of the highly-anticipated U.S. consumer price index report due later on Wednesday that is expected to offer some relief on the need for further rate hikes.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite, Shenzhen Component and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dropped on Wednesday while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened as of 8 p.m. in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures all in the green.\n\nAnnual inflation in the U.S. is expected to slow to 3.1% in June, the lowest since March 2021. The June inflation, along with the producer price data due on Thursday, will give insight into what could be the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move on interest rates.\n\nSeveral Fed officials said on Monday that more interest rate hikes may be needed to bring the annual inflation rate below 2%. However, there were also those who noted that an end to the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening cycle is in sight.\n\nThe central bank will meet on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates, which are currently between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nU.S. financial giants including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and BlackRock will also release their second-quarter earnings later this week to kick off the reporting season.\n\nEuropean bourses gained on Wednesday ahead of the latest U.S. inflation data announcement. The benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rose during Wednesday afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\n(updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBig-time financial institutions\u2019 involvement in Bitcoin solidifies crypto\u2019s position as a valid investment\n\nBlackRock was never supposed to be the first spot ETF\n\nWas it really all about transparency or was the SEC just not sure about Bitcoin?\n\nCrypto, specifically Bitcoin, has been around since its inception in 2009. People have traded back and forth using the token, whether to buy pizza or services over the internet. For the longest time, regulating bodies didn\u2019t take the technology and its potential seriously.\n\nBitcoin In The Government\u2019s Crosshairs\n\nGovernments started to take Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seriously when users started utilizing them for purposes that were deemed unfavorable. Whether it was cases in which crypto was used to purchase illegal substances or others in which financial entities would evade taxes.\n\nThings, however, took a serious turn when crypto-run businesses started causing damage to the financial wellbeing of citizens and governments alike. The FTX collapse really caught the attention of regulators at a whole new scale, simply because it caused billions of dollars in losses.\n\nEver since, regulators have been extra strict on the industry, going on the offensive against any private organization that may pose the threat of creating an FTX-like situation. While Terra\u2019s and Celsius\u2018s collapses did occur, causing even more billions of dollars in damage, regulating bodies have stayed vigilant and somewhat aggressive against crypto.\n\nWall Street Loans Credibility To Bitcoin\n\nNow, crypto, most specifically Bitcoin, is witnessing a phoenix-like revival due to corporate interest. The involvement of major financial corporations such as BlackRock, ARK, and Fidelity in crypto brings the promise of governmental and private regulation of the market.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin now has a better chance to receive a green light to grow and increase in utility as a payment option. So, as the trend goes, Bitcoin is looking optimistic in both value and regulation.\n\nNot Wall Street\u2019s First Attempt At Crypto\n\nWay before BlackRock, Fidelity, and co, Grayscale Investments had the crypto market to itself. Establishing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the company manages $19.1 billion in assets.\n\nInterestingly, Grayscale filed to convert GBTC to an ETF in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange. However, after stalling for a long time, the SEC rejected Grayscale\u2019s application last June, citing that the proposal lacked sufficient anti-fraud guarantees.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision was questioned not only by Grayscale but also by other governmental entities . Following the news, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC on the matter, yet no solid decision was taken thus far.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein celebrated the emergence of financial institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity in the crypto space.\n\n\u201cTo see literally the largest asset manager in the world publicly commit to advancing their crypto efforts only lends validity to the asset class and the staying power that it has,\u201d said Sonnenshein.\n\nThe Grayscale CEO is perhaps more optimistic about his company\u2019s ETF application now that BlackRock and co seem to be on their way to getting SEC\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re successful in that challenge there\u2019s actually billions of dollars in investor capital that would be unlocked through that.\u201d\n\nWill Bitcoin Stay \u201cDecentralized\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s fair to start looking at Bitcoin optimistically as an option for investment, as signs are showing toward a more stable future for the token. It\u2019s equally fair to assume that Bitcoin will likely increase in value in the future following Wall Street\u2019s involvement in the market.\n\nIt is somewhat fair to also assume that Bitcoin will fall under a lot more restrictions as such corporations will continue to build their own fortifications to avoid potential collapses on their investments.\n\nWith that in mind, the token that was once celebrated for being so decentralized people used it to buy pizzas online, is likely to be regulated by the same powers that controlled the traditional financial world that led people toward decentralized tokens in the first place. On top of that, regulating bodies are likely to add more regulatory constraints to tokens such as Bitcoin, effectively treating it as any other TradFi investment."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAccording to analysts, the next pre-halving surge for Bitcoin might start within the next four months\n\nNearly all of the largest Bitcoin investors saw an increase in their share values of more than 80% in just 30 days\n\nIt is anticipated that the price of Bitcoin will continue to rise both before and after each Bitcoin halving, as it has in the past\n\nThe imminent Bitcoin halving is expected to provide equities with a focus on Bitcoin\u2019s new momentum, including Michael Saylor\u2019s tech company MicroStrategy.\n\nBerenberg Puts Bullish Price Target For Microstrategy\n\nBerenberg Capital Markets, a New York-based investment company with a $430 price objective for MicroStrategy (MSTR), outlined its rationale for having a strong outlook in its research report.\n\nThe analysts assert that MicroStrategy derives most of its worth from the 152,333 Bitcoin it has on hand as of June 28 and add that a rally for the Bitcoin halving could result in a big price increase for its shares.\n\n\u201c[It] is our expectation that the price of Bitcoin will repeat its historical pattern of rallying both ahead of and following each Bitcoin halving.\u201d\n\nLast Bitcoin ETF decision deadline: 3/19/24 Bitcoin halving estimate: 4/16/24 \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/8zxcp8TQsh \u2014 Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) July 10, 2023\n\n\u201cIf the historical pattern established by the first three bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now,\u201d the report says\n\nThe 50% reduction in BTC issuance rate due to the April 26, 2024, Bitcoin halving would drastically slow the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAs Berenberg points out, the price of Bitcoin has increased by at least 682% over previous rounds of halving. The price of Bitcoin circled at $12 on November 28, 2012, when the first halving occurred.\n\nIts price reached its peak at $1,164 367 days later.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s supply follows a \u201cpredetermined path,\u201d the researchers pointed out that the entire demand for Bitcoin needed to be assessed before anybody could estimate the \u201cpotential magnitude\u201d of a future rise.\n\nAs evidence that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is increasing, the report used the recent jump in spot Bitcoin ETF applications from some of the world\u2019s \u201clargest and highest-profile\u201d asset managers.\n\nAccording to TradingView statistics, MicroStrategy shares are currently trading for $407.17, having increased by roughly 180% since the start of 2023. In the meantime, the cost of Bitcoin has risen by 84% since the year\u2019s beginning.\n\nMicrostrategy \u2013 the Biggest BTC Holder\n\nA few weeks ago, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance was set to reach 80% in the long term as regulators crack down on other assets; MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor then confirmed that MicroStrategy is the largest public holder of BTC.\n\nSaylor explained that since 2020, Bitcoin has been the sole institutional-grade investable asset in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, according to MicroStrategy\u2019s view. According to him, Bitcoin is a digital commodity that is accepted universally and internationally.\n\nSaylor thinks that stablecoins, crypto securities, and crypto derivatives do not have a \u201clegitimate path forward\u201d in the eyes of authorities. In its actions against Binance and Coinbase, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared 19 cryptocurrency assets as securities last month.\n\nCompanies Who Are the Biggest Bitcoin Holders\n\nMicroStrategy, Inc.\n\nThe company\u2019s investment had an entry value of $3.975 billion. The company holds approximately 152,333 BTC . Saylor is optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential and sure that the investment would be profitable.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings\n\nMarathon is a cryptocurrency mining corporation with a market cap of $225 million as of today and 12,538 Bitcoins with an entry value of $150 million. The shares jumped 81.35% in the last month.\n\nCoinbase Global Inc.\n\nCoinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, is no stranger to the Bitcoin community. With an entrance value of $173.7 million and a current worth of $201.6 million, the corporation currently has approximately 9,000 BTC. In the last month, the shares of the crypto exchange jumped over 60%.\n\nSquare Inc.\n\nWith an entrance value of $220 million and a current worth of $179.8 million, the financial services and mobile payment company currently possesses 8,027 BTC . Similar to Coinbase, Square has made a modest investment in Bitcoin compared to other companies on this list, but it is obvious that Square believes the cryptocurrency market has potential. The jump within the last 30 days was around 7%.\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp.\n\nAnother cryptocurrency mining business that has diversified its holdings by purchasing Bitcoin is Hut 8. Approximately 9,136 BTC is held by the corporation. The shares of this company skyrocketed within the last 30 days by more than 95%.\n\nBlockchain Hive\n\nA cryptocurrency mining business called Hive Blockchain has operations in Sweden and Canada. With a current worth of $69.2 million, the corporation now possesses approximately 3,091 Bitcoin. Blockchain Hive shares jumped almost 90% in the last month.\n\nNEXON Co., Ltd.\n\nJapanese video game developer NEXON has been in business since 1994. At the time of writing, the corporation has 1,717 BTC, valued at $38,458,825 on the market. Bitcoin is one of the non-gaming sectors that NEXON has invested in as part of its diversification strategy. With a market valuation of more than $20 billion, the corporation is in a good financial position.\n\nVoyager Digital LTD.\n\nA Canadian cryptocurrency dealer named Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The corporation has 1,239 BTC as of March 2023, valued at $27,752,175 at today\u2019s market rates.\n\nBinance\n\nData tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows the balance held in Binance\u2019s wallets has increased by more than 52,000 BTC ($1.5 billion) in four weeks, taking the tally to 692,880 BTC. The global tally (coins held on all centralized exchanges) has increased by more than 27,000 BTC.\n\nDespite concerns voiced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), CEO Changpeng Zhao has confirmed the company\u2019s support for Voyager\u2019s acquisition by Binance US.\n\nConclusion\n\nPublic firms are becoming more aware of the benefits of Bitcoin investments and holding, and astute investors can participate without abandoning the stock market. Investing in any of the aforementioned businesses will give you indirect access to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThese top 10 players have proven they are willing to investigate investment opportunities and take calculated risks in the ever changing bitcoin market. What remains to be seen is how these businesses will modify and develop their investing strategies once Bitcoin firmly establishes its status as a mature asset."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAfter the summit in Miami, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. invested up to $250,000 in Bitcoin\n\nHis comments in May that he was not an investor in Bitcoin disagree with the most current investment disclosure\n\nKennedy is a fervent supporter of Bitcoin and has received backing from some well-known figures in the cryptocurrency world\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democratic presidential contender, admitted to owning a sizeable quantity of Bitcoin after originally denying it and giving the cryptocurrency to his wife. Nevertheless, his campaign claims that there is no conflict of interest.\n\nNo Conflict of Interest in Owning BTC\n\nKennedy gave a keynote speech at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami in May and lauded Bitcoin, saying the network should be nourished and safeguarded. He added that Bitcoin donations would be accepted for his campaign. But he also made it clear to conference attendees that he did not own Bitcoin and that his support for the asset did not constitute investing advice.\n\nKennedy also compared his position to that of the current U.S. president and cited Biden\u2019s proposed 30% excise tax on cryptocurrency miners, arguing it would require a \u201cinvasive surveillance apparatus to monitor what is happening in individual computers\u201d and would be unwise to set such a precedent.\n\nKennedy\u2019s family does, however, appear to have between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin in a brokerage account as of June 30, according to a financial declaration acquired by CNBC. According to the report, which does not specify when the transaction was made, Kennedy\u2019s family earned less than $201 from the purchase.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, Kennedy\u2019s campaign manager, commented that there was no conflict of interest and that the purchase happened following Kennedy\u2019s supportive comments about Bitcoin in Miami.\n\nFollowing the article\u2019s publication, Kennedy\u2019s campaign initially informed the public that the Bitcoin belonged to Kennedy\u2019s wife, Cheryl Hines, who is well-known for her work on the television program \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201d Later, a Kennedy campaign official clarified that they were wrong and that Kennedy actually did own the Bitcoin investment.\n\nOld Bitcoin Proponent\n\nWhile Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have both made an effort to court the Bitcoin vote, Kennedy has been a steadfast backer of Bitcoin among Democratic contenders.\n\nKennedy has tweeted less frequently about Bitcoin since Miami, and the subject was not brought up during his lengthy one-on-one interview with Twitter CEO Elon Musk last month. Nevertheless, Kennedy has occasionally continued to support the oldest cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin, he claimed on June 27, \u201cis not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, but it also points the way toward a future in which governmental institutions are more open and democratic.\u201d\n\nAs president, I will make sure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is inviolable.

According to a recent Echelon Insights study, 65% of people would support Biden over Kennedy, who would be chosen by only 14% of respondents.\n\nWhat Other Presidential Candidates Think of Bitcoin (Crypto)?\n\n\u201cNo fundamental value,\u201d \u2013 Joe Biden, Democrat\n\nJoe Biden, the current president of the United States, launched his reelection campaign on April 25. He is currently the likely favorite to be the Democratic Party\u2019s choice for president.\n\nThe 2023 Economic Report of the President, which includes a section on cryptocurrency for the first time since it started in 1950, may best capture Biden\u2019s perspective on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe purpose of this section was to refute the \u201cPerceived Appeal of Crypto Assets.\u201d It suggested that many of cryptocurrency\u2019s \u201ctouted\u201d benefits are unattainable and that \u201cmany of them have no fundamental value.\u201d\n\nBiden has advocated against what he calls \u201ctax loopholes\u201d for cryptocurrency and even opposed a deal with Republicans to raise the debt ceiling because, in his words, it protected \u201cwealthy tax cheats and crypto traders.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value. They\u2019re telling us. pic.twitter.com/BM6JGMEFeq \u2014 President Biden (@POTUS) May 9, 2023\n\n\u201cNot a Fan of Bitcoin\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump, a Republican\n\nOn November 15, 2022, the former president turned NFT salesperson Trump threw in the towel on his non-consecutive reelection bid. According to recent polling, he is the Republican nominee with the most support.\n\nCryptocurrencies, according to Trump, \u201cmay be fake\u201d and are \u201ca disaster waiting to happen.\u201d Additionally, he has stated that Bitcoin \u201cjust seems like a scam\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t like it \u201cbecause it is another currency competing against the dollar.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a tweet in July 2019 that he was \u201cnot a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\u201d and that their value was \u201cbased on thin air.\u201d However, Trum seems to be loving NFTs as his wife Melania has recently introduced a fresh line of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on famous American sites.\n\nI am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.

        "content": "Bitcoin prices are edging towards the $31,000 mark. Illustration: Omar Marques/SOPA/LightRocket/Getty (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) prices whipsawed on Wednesday edging up towards the $31,000 (\u00a323875.74) mark as US CPI data came in hot.\n\nBy 3.30pm in London, it was up around 1% on the day to trade at $30,760 having fallen slightly earlier.\n\nNew data showed that US inflation cooled off sharply in June. The CPI rose 3% from a year ago, the slowest rate for more than two years. The report was surprisingly upbeat and will form future rate hiking cycles for the Fed.\n\n\"Cold as ice \u2013 that is the number that comes to mind when you look at the US CPI data,\" said Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets. \"This is the lowest number since the pandemic, and this is certainly good news for the economy, but it is important to keep in mind that this is still a transitory situation. But overall, traders are cheering this event, and while futures have moved higher, the dollar index has lost more momentum.\"\n\nMeanwhile, ether (ETH-USD) also rose around 1% to trade at $1,895.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe moves come following a positive market prediction from British bank Standard Chartered (STAN.L) bank on Monday. Analysts projected that Bitcoin prices would reach $50,000 by the end of 2023 and cross the $120,000 mark in 2024. This is an upward revision from the $100,000 it predicted in April.\n\n\"We now think this estimate is too conservative, and we therefore see upside to our end-2024 target,\" the report said, citing increased bitcoin miner profitability as one of the factors that will drive the price.\n\nWatch: Vanguard Adds Exposure to Bitcoin Mining Companies\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "title": "Will the Rally in Bitcoin Mining ETFs Last in 2H23? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The year 2023 has so far seen Bitcoin mining companies exceed the performance of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). The cryptocurrency is up about 84% so far this year (as of Jul 10, 2023).\n\nMeanwhile, Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI, Crypto Industry Innovators ETF BITQ, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF SATO and Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITS added about 244.8%, 172.2%, 161.4% and 124.8%, respectively, so far this year (as of Jul 10, 2023).\n\nThis divergence in price performance is primarily attributed to a less-hawkish Fed which helped growth stocks like bitcoin miners. Increased transaction fees, prominent issuers\u2019 interest in launching a bitcoin ETF also acted as drivers in boosting those stocks. If these were not enough, the leveraged beta effect, which tends to boost mining stocks more than the underlying asset, played a key role.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of interest rate hikes left investors wondering if mining stocks can maintain their upward trajectory in the second half of the year. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper.\n\nFears of Higher Rates Weigh on Crypto Stocks\n\nThe Fed's efforts to curb inflation through interest rate hikes have caused uncertainties for high-risk assets like digital currencies. In past one week, bitcoin remained almost flat. While this decline may be a short-term correction, a resilient U.S. labor market strengthens rate hike expectations, alarming Bitcoin's future.\n\nWhat Are Silver Linings?\n\nBlackrock, WisdomTree and Invesco Plan to Launch Bitcoin ETFs: The filing of spot ETF applications by renowned asset managers fueled a growing interest in cryptocurrencies from institutional and corporate clients. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been in denial for a Bitcoin ETF for long, the filings represent a significant step towards widespread adoption. The world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock\u2019s plans to launch a bitcoin ETF in June influenced the entire space. Two other large investment firms now joined the queue, WisdomTree and Invesco.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraditional Finance Giants Explore Crypto Space: Renowned financial institutions, including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel Securities, have partnered to launch EDX Markets, a crypto exchange platform. EDX Markets, which had faced delays due to regulatory uncertainty, has finally listed major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: Institutions such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which were against virtual currencies before, have started implementing them into their systems. This is a sign of growing acceptance among institutional investors.\n\nFavorable Regulations in the Cards?Though the SEC\u2019s stance toward cryptocurrency has been adverse so far, back-to-back efforts in launching an ETF from reported issuers stirred speculation that such intuitional initiatives might compel legislative institutions to figure out how to classify and regulate them.\n\nPositive Outlook for Bitcoin Mining Companies: Bitcoin mining stocks are well-positioned for growth. Mining companies have been making expansion moves, increasing their hash rates, and planning to acquire more mining machines. Such companies include Hut 8 Mining, Riot Platforms and Cleanspark. In fact, bitcoin hash rate hit a new all-time high amid weakening prices.\n\nBitcoin Having Expected in 2024: Halving events, which occur about every four years, lower the mining rewards by half. The resulting shortage of newly mined BTC has historically played a crucial role in driving price rallies. As the having event looms in 2024, traders are tightening their belts for a new cycle. So, there is high chance of an upward momentum for Bitcoin.\n\nCheaper Valuation: Last year, bitcoin was thrashed as rising rates weighed on speculative and growth investments. This has helped the crypto block to bounce back with all force.\n\nSustainability Parameter: Cryptocurrencies are being promoted as an eco-friendlier investment. Sustainability concerns are in vogue lately as the global investing world is concerned about climate change.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of top cryptocurrency bitcoin could reach $50,000 this year and $120,000 by the end of 2024 Standard Chartered said on Monday, predicting the recent jump in its price could encourage bitcoin \"miners\" to hoard more of the supply.Standard Chartered published a $100,000 end-2024 forecast for bitcoin back in April on the view the so-called \"crypto winter\" was over, but one of the bank's top FX analysts, Geoff Kendrick, said there was now 20% \"upside\" to that call.\"Increased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\" Kendrick said in a report.Bitcoin's price has leapt 80% since the start of the year but its current level of just over $30,200 is still less than half the $69,000 it peaked back in November 2021.Trillions of dollars were wiped from the crypto sector in 2022, as central banks hiked rates and a string of crypto firms, such as the FTX exchange , imploded. This year's collapse of a number of traditional-style banks though has fed the rebound.Standard Chartered said the rationale for its predicted price rise was that miners who mint the 900 new bitcoins produced each day around the world would soon need to sell fewer to cover their costs - mostly electricity to power super-computers.Kendrick estimated that miners have recently been selling 100% of their new coins. If the price hits $50,000 though, they would probably only sell 20-30%.\"It is the equivalent of miners reducing the amount of bitcoins they sell per day to just 180-270 from 900 currently.\"\"Over a year, that would reduce miner selling from 328,500 to a range of 65,700-98,550 - a reduction in net BTC supply of roughly 250,000 bitcoins a year.\"Next April or May the total number of bitcoins able to be mined each day is also set to halve due to an inbuilt supply and issuance mechanism that gradually limits supply to maintain its appeal.Predictions of sky-high valuations have been commonplace during bitcoin's past rallies. A Citi analyst said in November 2020 that bitcoin could climb as high as $318,000 by the end of 2022. It closed last year down about 65% at $16,500."

Discover SCENE\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most popular video games can now earn players Bitcoin, thanks to a new Minecraft integration facilitated by Bitcoin-centric payments startup, Zebedee.\n\nSatlantis, a Bitcoin-themed Minecraft server operated by community members, has integrated Zebedee\u2019s Lightning Network-enabled gaming tech, letting players earn Bitcoin for playing. It works with the Java edition of Minecraft on computers, and players can withdraw their earnings to the ZBD wallet app on iOS or Android.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s an unofficial integration of Bitcoin tech that isn\u2019t endorsed by Minecraft developer Mojang or publisher Microsoft. The Satlantis server is broadly inspired by the leading cryptocurrency, with gameplay elements inspired by Bitcoin mining rigs and mining pool collectives, plus the ability to boost your mining \u201chash rate\u201d to have a better chance of winning Bitcoin in-game.\n\n@Minecraft, meet #Bitcoin \ud83d\udfe7\ud83e\udde1 Introducing @PlaySatlantis, where you can earn real bitcoin in the world's most popular game.

Satlantis is giving out over 1 million satoshis per week, according to Zebedee, which is 1% of a Bitcoin\u2014in other words, it\u2019s just over $300 total per week worth of Bitcoin. A satoshi is the smallest unit of measure for a Bitcoin; each Bitcoin contains 100 million satoshis.\n\nBut that\u2019s pretty typical for games and apps that reward players with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. Games like Sweet Bitcoin and Ethereum Blast that Decrypt has reviewed typically pay out about a few cents\u2019 worth of cryptocurrency per hour of play.\n\nIn addition to various mobile games that use Zebedee\u2019s gaming tech, the firm also previously launched specialized Bitcoin-earning servers for another major traditional gaming smash: Valve\u2019s squad-based shooter, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Zebedee enabled Bitcoin wagering and rewards in that game back in 2021.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t the first time that Minecraft has crossed paths with Bitcoin, either. Years back, a now-shuttered server called BitQuest let players find and collect small amounts of Bitcoin, which could be spent in-game. Other fan-run Minecraft servers have experimented with NFT and crypto integrations in the past.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Microsoft plans to crack down on such integrations. In July 2022, the tech giant announced that it planned to ban NFTs from all Minecraft servers, stating that NFT-based token-gated features are \u201cnot inclusive of all our community and create a scenario of the haves and the have-nots.\u201d\n\nOne year later, Microsoft still hasn\u2019t updated Minecraft\u2019s terms and conditions to reflect the expected NFT ban. In June, however, a Microsoft representative confirmed to Decrypt that Minecraft still plans to follow through with the move.\n\nDespite Minecraft\u2019s NFT ban not yet becoming official, some fan-run servers and derivative projects either shut down or changed course. NFT Worlds, a project that sold NFT-based land plots for a dedicated Minecraft server, ultimately opted to create its own similar game instead.\n\nMinecraft\u2019s original news post about the planned ban also mentioned \u201cother blockchain technologies,\u201d which could include cryptocurrency. A Satlantis representative suggested to Decrypt that it is unconcerned, given that larger, more established servers already violate Minecraft's end user licensing agreement (EULA).\n\n\"The EULA is quite restrictive actually, but from our research, it seems to be more of a defensive contract that Mojang can use in case of any issues that an individual server runs into,\" they said. \"They do not seem to enforce it unless compelled to, as there are many large servers with 10,000+ players that go against said rules.\"\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to include comments from Satlantis."

Despite these setbacks, Argo is enhancing its total hash rate capacity and signals a stronger outlook for the future.\n\nArgo Blockchain\u2019s Bitcoin Production Falls in June\n\nIn June 2023, Argo mined 139 Bitcoin or Bitcoin Equivalents, averaging 4.6 BTC daily. This represents a decrease of 17% from the 5.6 BTC mined each day in May 2023. During the previous month, the total number of tokens mined was 173 BTC.\n\nJune\u2019s decline is attributed to increased network difficulty and a scale-down of operations at the Helios facility in Texas. While this curtailment limited the number of Bitcoin mined, Argo anticipates additional cash inflows from specific power trading activities that Helios' operator previously undertook.\n\nThe Company's revenue in June totalled $3.84 million, marking a drop of 19% from May 2023's figure of $4.75 million.\n\nKeep Reading South Africa Navigates Crypto Regulations: To License 60 Firms This Month\n\nDespite declining production and revenue over the past month, ARGO shares on Wall Street are at relatively high levels. The company tested the April highs during yesterday\u2019s (Tuesday\u2019s) session, closing the day at almost $30 per share.\n\nSource: Yahoo Finance\n\nEnhancements to Hash Rate Capacity\n\nAs noted on 30 June, Argo held 44 BTC. The firm maintained its total hash rate capacity at 2.5 EH/s and began to equip its Quebec facilities with new BlockMiner machines. Once fully operational, these machines are projected to boost the company's total hash rate capacity by 12%, raising it to roughly 2.8 EH/s.\n\nDespite the short-term challenges reflected in the report in June, the company's efforts to bolster its mining capacity underline a strategic response to an increasingly competitive cryptocurrency mining landscape.\n\nCryptocurrency Winter Hurt the Company\n\nUnaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2023 from Argo Blockchain were published last month. Argo reported a significant boost in revenue in Q1 2023, which saw an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter of 2022, totalling $11.4 million. Regardless of this growth and an adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million, the company sustained a net loss of $8.7 million.\n\nWhat is more, the company's 2022 financials revealed a contrasting picture. The publicly-listed mining firm reported a year-end revenue of $58.6 million, marking a substantial decline of 36%. The year saw the company suffering a net loss of $240.2 million. This situation is primarily influenced by the falling value of cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies By using cryptography, virtual currencies, known as cryptocurrencies, are nearly counterfeit-proof digital currencies that are built on blockchain technology.

After a record-breaking 2021, they earned $6 billion less, which was mainly due to the ever-increasing difficulty of mining.\n\nArgo appears to be regaining stability even with the adverse net results. Despite the threat of bankruptcy, a decisive agreement with Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., a finance company with expertise in digital assets, successfully averted the impending closure and set Argo back on track."

        "content": "The Mining Future\n\nDUBAI, UAE , July 11, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Mining Future, a leading provider of Bitcoin and crypto mining hosting services, is spearheading the evolution of the mining industry by offering cost-effective hosting solutions and unparalleled accessibility to crypto enthusiasts worldwide. With the cryptocurrency landscape rapidly evolving over the past couple of years, The Mining Future has emerged as a frontrunner in the industry, revolutionizing the way mining operations are conducted.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina, the USA, and the EU have long dominated the Bitcoin hosting and crypto mining scene, but rising costs and regulatory challenges have led miners to seek alternative jurisdictions. In this context, The Mining Future has strategically established its headquarters in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to capitalize on the country\u2019s ambitious vision to become a global leader in the crypto industry. The UAE\u2019s commitment to fostering crypto-friendly regulations, inviting startups and miners within its jurisdiction, and making significant investments to secure its position as a hub for crypto companies have been instrumental in The Mining Future\u2019s decision to choose the UAE as its base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that the UAE\u2019s proactive approach to regulation and its commitment to supporting the growth of the crypto industry aligns perfectly with our vision for The Mining Future,\u201d said a spokesperson of The Mining Future. \u201cBy operating from the UAE, we can offer our clients a secure and reliable hosting environment while tapping into the country\u2019s thriving crypto ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to their presence in the UAE, The Mining Future is expanding its operations by opening two new state-of-the-art data centers in the Dominican Republic and in Kuwait. This move reflects the company\u2019s commitment to securing clean energy sources and providing its clients with significantly lower rates than the market average. The Mining Future\u2019s dedication to finding optimal energy solutions ensures that Bitcoin mining hosting operations remain environmentally sustainable while maximizing profitability for miners.\n\nStory continues\n\n\n\n\n\nOne notable aspect that sets The Mining Future apart from its competitors is its emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity. The company\u2019s commitment to democratizing the Bitcoin mining network is evident in its policy of accepting a minimum order quantity (MOQ) of just one miner, compared to the industry-standard MOQ of >10 miners. This approach empowers individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their geographical location, to participate in the Bitcoin mining network and contribute to its decentralization.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further enhance the customer experience, The Mining Future offers a wide range of ASIC and GPU miners, including popular models . By maintaining transparency throughout the purchasing and hosting process, The Mining Future ensures that clients are equipped with the necessary knowledge and support to make informed decisions. The company\u2019s dedicated customer service team provides personalized assistance and consulting services to support both experienced miners and those new to the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs The Mining Future continues to expand its global presence, their current and new data centers with available capacity in Dominican Republic, Dubai and Kuwait provide an ideal hosting environment for miners seeking cost-effective solutions. Compared to the average hosting costs in China, the USA, and the EU, The Mining Future offers highly competitive rates without compromising on the quality and reliability of their services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Mining Future:\n\nFounded in 2021 by Gilbert Corbella and Miquel Angel Corbella, also known as the Corbella Brothers, The Mining Future FZCO was born out of a quest for a solution in a post-pandemic world where traditional investment avenues no longer provided sufficient returns to combat rising inflation. Recognizing the potential of Bitcoin mining as a lucrative investment opportunity, the Corbella Bros set up their own mining operations farm in Georgia, Europe, overcoming numerous challenges along the way. Eventually, their dedication and perseverance paid off, leading them to achieve financial independence.\n\nWith newfound financial freedom, the Corbella Bros embarked on a mission to share their success and transform the perception of Bitcoin mining. Acknowledging the industry\u2019s tarnished reputation and prevalent scams, they set out to destigmatize Bitcoin mining and make it transparent, accessible, and reliable for everyone. The Mining Future FZCO not only aims to cater to experienced investors but also offers retail investors the opportunity to acquire high-performing assets and enjoy regular passive incomes with the most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\nDriven by the vision of empowering individuals on their journey towards financial independence, The Mining Future FZCO strives to be the catalyst that propels investors towards their goals. By providing a trustworthy and profitable avenue for investment, the company aims to revolutionize the perception of Bitcoin mining and redefine its role as a viable and rewarding opportunity.\n\nWebsite: https://www.theminingfuture.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nOrdinals have already increased activity on the BTC blockchain while maintaining low fees\n\nBRC-69\u2019s creator\u2019s dream of creating an \u201cinternal internet\u201d might come true\n\nOrdinals are coming to Ethereum\n\nOrdinals, NFTs on the BTC blockchain made the headlines last week as it adopted a new protocol named BRC-69. The protocol utilizes a method called Recursive Inscription which allows users to make the most of the space provided on each block.\n\nOrdinals are now back in the headlines for their staggering success. Crypto analytics firms are reporting a huge increase in transaction rates on the BTC blockchain while maintaining transaction fees.\n\nWith such mass technology adoption, is it possible to achieve the dream predicted by BRC-69 creators?\n\nA Busy Day On The BlockChain\n\nAccording to Dune , Ordinals saw 385,920 inscriptions over the weekend, making it the second-busiest day ever for Ordinals. The busiest day for the NFTs was May 7th, which saw around 400,000 inscriptions.\n\nThe huge surge of activity on the blockchain is likely due to the introduction of BRC-69, a technology that allows users to bypass the 4-megabyte limit on each block. More importantly, the Dune dashboard recorded the average transaction fee to be around 2.5 BTC, which is a huge discount from previous inscription fees.\n\nBRC-69 Tl;Dr\n\nEvery block allows 4 megabytes of data to be stored. With the BTC blockchain gaining more users, blocks are becoming more scarce, and transaction fees are increasing over time.\n\nThe idea behind BRC-69 lies with recursive inscription. Recursive Inscription uses coding lines that allow blocks to retrieve information from other blocks. So, users may now use most of their block to store new information and utilize a fraction of the storage memory to insert an inscription that recalls data from another block, effectively giving it access to eight megabytes of data instead.\n\nThe technology doesn\u2019t just allow the recollection of data from a single block but from whatever number of blocks utilize recursive inscription. So, if 300,000 blocks use Ordinals BRC-69, a user may use recursive inscription to retrieve data from all of them, accessing Gigabytes of data through a mere 4-megabyte block.\n\nWTF are recursive inscriptions? Here is everything you need to know: Earlier this year the Ordinals Protocol introduced the ability for anyone to inscribe files fully on-chain onto Bitcoin. These inscriptions are self-contained and unaware of the other files that had been\u2026 pic.twitter.com/O3jt6lhaxT \u2014 Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) June 12, 2023\n\nA New Bitcoin-based Internet?\n\n\u201cWe can think even bigger, though. What if lots of people upload lots of packages of code? So now there is a huge repository of packages for developers to build on top of. This would unlock powerful use cases that could never be done in under 4 MB. The most complex pieces of software are just a bunch of code compiled together, after all.\n\nNow it becomes possible to put a complex 3D video game on-chain on Bitcoin fully. The sky is the limit. Bitcoin is essentially getting an internal internet where every file can request data from the other files on Bitcoin,\u201d \u2013 reads the tweet above.\n\nEssentially the technology creator dreams of a Bitcoin-based network of information that would use recursive inscriptions to allow the creation of huge programs based on a single block.\n\nWith increased interest in Ordinals, BRC-69 is increasing the likelihood of such a future.\n\nORDI and OXBT, have partnered with Emblem to bring BRC-20 tokens to the Ethereum blockchain. While it is yet to provide a bridge for recursive inscription, it definitely increases the potential for such a future.\n\n\u2b1b\ufe0f\ud83d\udfe7 $ORDI and $OXBT MEGATHREAD \ud83d\udfe7\u2b1b\ufe0f \ud83d\ude80 VAULTING IS NOW LIVE \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udd38 How to Mint\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Where to Trade\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Vaulting Mechanics\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Details, Info, Integrations, and Partnerships pic.twitter.com/AANoZjTVxs \u2014 Emblem Vault (@EmblemVault) July 6, 2023"

        "content": "Grayscale Investments has reached an agreement with New York-based investment firm Fir Tree Capital Management over its Bitcoin Trust.\n\nAccording to a July 11 announcement from Fir Tree, Grayscale agreed to provide additional documentation related to its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) after Fir Tree filed a lawsuit in December 2022. The complaint against Grayscale aimed at having the asset manager stop plans to turn its GBTC trust into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and provide documentation on its relationship with Digital Currency Group, Grayscale\u2019s parent company.\n\nFir Tree claimed that roughly 850,000 retail investors had been \u201charmed by Grayscale\u2019s shareholder-unfriendly actions\u201d based on the firm\u2019s lack of a redemption program from GBTC into cash or crypto. In addition, its legal team said Grayscale attempting to launch a spot crypto ETF could \u201ccost years of litigation, millions of dollars in legal fees, countless hours of lost management time, and goodwill with regulators.\u201d\n\nRelated: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust nears 2023 highs on BlackRock ETF filing as buyers step up\n\n\u201cOnce Grayscale provides Fir Tree with the GBTC documents that it has agreed to produce under this agreement, we will be able to further investigate Grayscale in order to determine our appropriate next steps, which may include filing additional litigation against Grayscale, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and their respective directors, officers, and advisors, or others who should be held accountable for destroying billions of dollars of GBTC\u2019s market value,\u201d said Fir Tree.\n\nGrayscale filed a legal challenge against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June 2022 after the regulator denied an application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF. The lawsuit is ongoing, with the SEC having not approved any spot crypto investment vehicle despite applications pending from BlackRock and other investment firms.\n\nMagazine: Get your money back: The weird world of crypto litigation"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) discount shrank to its lowest level in a year, hitting 26.7% of its NAV on July 6.\n\nThe amelioration comes amid a wave of exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. and the settlement of a lawsuit against one of its shareholders.\n\nOne GBTC represents the smallest unit of Bitcoin held by a U.S.-based trust. Currently, it holds BTC worth $19.07 billion. GBTC was last trading at a discount of 27.8% on the price of spot Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe GBTC shares have traded at a discount to Bitcoin\u2019s market value since February 2021, reaching lows of nearly 50% in December 2022.\n\nThe primary reason for the discount in GBTC is that it is a closed-end fund, which means that investors cannot redeem GBTC for the underlying Bitcoin, making it challenging to track the fair market price and reducing its demand.\n\nThere are several alternative investment products like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which closely tracks BTC price and has seen increasing demand since its launch last year.\n\nGBTC also charges an annual management fee of 2%, which slowly eats into the principal value.\n\nGrayscale: ETF or redemptions\n\nGrayscale has attempted to convert its trust fund into an ETF to enable redemptions at Bitcoin\u2019s market price, however, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied approval so far.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe firm sued the SEC to contest SEC\u2019s rejection in court. The verdict of the lawsuit is expected to arrive this fall.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF filing on June 16 revived the market\u2019s hope around an ETF approval, with hopes that approval could come for Grayscale too.\n\nThe GBTC discount dropped from around 44% before BlockRock\u2019s filling to 26.7% in less than a month.\n\nGBTC discount rate on BTC market price. Source: Coinglass .\n\nAnother factor promoting GBTC demand is the possibility of opening redemptions regardless of ETF approval amid scrutiny by a meaningful shareholder of Grayscale, Fir Tree Partners.\n\nFir Tree Partners had filed books-and-records litigation against Grayscale in 2022, accusing them of mismanagement and conflicts of interest.\n\nYesterday, the trust fund settled outside court, agreeing to produce certain books and records in response to Fir Tree\u2019s demand.\n\nFir Tree argues that Grayscale\u2019s management has not acted in favor of its shareholders by limiting redemptions. They wrote Grayscale \u201cfailed to address our continued concerns about GBTC\u2019s structure and the unavailability of redemptions.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Grayscale, failed to repay a $630 million loan to Genesis, and U.S.-based Gemini filed a lawsuit against DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert accusing them of fraud related to their Genesis offerings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe events have increased the urgency among GBTC shareholders like Fir Tree to enable early redemptions, with the firm writing that it is now time for Grayscale and DCG \u201cto facilitate GBTC share redemptions.\u201d"

        "content": "A third straight week of positive digital asset inflows has fully corrected nine previous weeks of outflows for the market, according to a report from CoinShares published on July 10.\n\nThis week\u2019s inflows registered $136 million. Bitcoin (BTC) funds continued their trend of holding the anchor position, with 98% of the inflows coming into BTC. The other 2% mostly came into Ether (ETH), multi-asset holdings and a handful of altcoins.\n\nFund flows for the week ending July 7. Source: CoinShares\n\nAfter nine weeks in which digital asset outflows outpaced inflows, this third consecutive week of positive movement brings the current streak\u2019s total to $470 million. According to CoinShares, this total fully corrects for the previous outflow streak.\n\nThis brings the last 3 consecutive weeks inflows to US$470m, fully correcting the prior 9 weeks of outflows.\n\n\n\nTrading turnover has slowed though, which might be explained by the seasonal effects, where lower volumes are typically seen during July and August.\n\n\n\n2/6 pic.twitter.com/4uyvrY0aRP \u2014 CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) July 10, 2023\n\nBitcoin inflows showed no signs of slowing down this past week after posting yearlong highs in the previous two. As Cointelegraph previously reported, BTC inflows for last week were $123 million. This week adds $10 million, bringing the two-week inflow haul for BTC alone to $256 million.\n\nThis continues Bitcoin\u2019s crypto market dominance by extending its total market cap from last week\u2019s 51.46% to a reported 51.66% share as of July 11.\n\nIn other good news for hodlers, blockchain equities inflows reached a yearlong high of $15 million. This more than doubled last week\u2019s $6.8 million, which snapped a nine-week outflow streak of its own, according to CoinShares.\n\nHowever, there may be some indication of equilibrium on the horizon, as overall liquidity appears to be down. According to the report, trading volume has hit a \u201cseasonal low,\u201d imitating cycles from previous years that saw low liquidity in July and August.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin supply shock will send BTC price to $120K \u2014 Standard Chartered\n\nDespite the continuing positive news surrounding inflows, some investors appear to be getting nervous over the lack of a clear trend.\n\nPositive sentiment generated by the expectation that one or more companies would finally receive authorization from the United States government to offer BTC as a spot exchange-traded fund may be tapering off as the process wears on.\n\nThere also remains an air of uncertainty, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s ongoing litigation against Binance and Coinbase continues with no clear sign as to how the courts will decide.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "title": "Bitcoin ATMs - What You Need To Know - Dataconomy",
        "content": "Way back in 2009, when Bitcoin was first introduced to the digital market, excited investors often found themselves on the receiving end of ridicule and teasing. Shouts of \u201cYou\u2019re buying thin air\u201d, and \u201cWhy are you wasting your money on nonsense\u201d could sometimes be heard, but over the years, this cryptocurrency has more than proven its worth, with Bitcoin being so in demand that the price has skyrocketed and early buyers have even found themselves being able to retire thanks to the value of the crypto. It\u2019s become so popular that there are even ATMs dotted around to transact with Bitcoin, but what are they and how do they work?\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ATM?\n\nMost banks will have ATMs set up to provide a quick and convenient way for their customers to access their accounts, withdraw money and check their balance. Bitcoin ATMs are different in the sense that instead of withdrawing, they provide the option to insert cash and have it exchanged into this form of cryptocurrency.\n\nThis can be done in a wide selection of locations, with options for multiple currencies to be exchanged, with USD being the most popular option.\n\nAs almost $11 billion Bitcoin is traded with in every 24 hour period, these ATMs have made it easier to take part in peer to peer trades, as well as marketplace exchanges.\n\nHow can these machines be used?\n\nWith a Bitcoin ATM, everything is digitized, meaning that once the cash has been inserted, the steps that follow are straightforward whilst ensuring safety and security. In most cases, the cash will need to be applied first and then the user will have the option to log in using their Wallet ID, or a QR code directly from their smartphone.\n\nDepending on the currency being transacted with, the current market\u2019s exchange rate will be displayed, for example as 1 USD to BTC and the trader can choose to accept, or receive their cash back. The process was intentionally designed to be streamlined so as to avoid any potential drops in Bitcoin value from hour to hour.\n\nWhy might a Bitcoin ATM be used?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why people may choose to use an ATM for Bitcoin \u2013 from topping up their wallet ready for a trade, right through to taking advantage of a sudden reduction in crypto value.\n\nThe option can be ideal for both long-term and short-term traders, too, as once deposited, the cash exchanged will immediately transfer into BTC, allowing the sum to be stored, or traded away as soon as required, and without any delay.\n\nWhat is needed to use a Bitcoin ATM?\n\nWith more than 63,000 Bitcoin ATMs throughout the United States alone, traders will find at least one accessible within convenience stores, malls and other locations.\n\nIn order to use the machine, the trader will first need cash, and access to their Bitcoin wallet ID.\n\nThe machine has a small slot for paper cash to be inserted, and this will need to be done one bill at a time. Each time a bill is approved, the machine will register the amount. Once the transaction is complete, a button on the touchscreen can be pressed and a new image will load providing details on the currency exchange rate as defined by the market at that time.\n\nThe ATM is maintained under strict supervision, allowing it to retrieve data securely from a global server, which in turn provides up-to-date currency values on the spot.\n\nThe Wallet ID can be added, or the QR code can be scanned by the built-in camera, or alternatively by tapping the sensor on compatible machines, and the user will then have the option to complete their transfer once the credentials have been accepted.\n\nAre these machines safe to use?\n\nYes, in fact, they use some of the most advanced encryption software available, surpassing the technology of certain banks.\n\nHuman error is one of the leading contributors of issues arising, however, and these machines are not impervious to fraudulent activities, and so caution is always advised.\n\nThere is also a small fee to consider when using these ATMs, often between 13 and 15% of the total transaction value. For instance, when transferring $100 USD into Bitcoin, the machine\u2019s software will retain anywhere between $13 and $15.\n\nOther fees can apply, such as flat fees, or currency conversion fees \u2013 but this will all be detailed on the device itself.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nBitcoin ATMs provide a safe, secure way to access a Bitcoin wallet, review an account\u2019s balance, or simply insert a cash currency and have it exchanged into BTC with minimal fuss. They are ideal for traders that don\u2019t currently have access to an app, or want to take advantage of a decline in BTC value. Additionally, they are frequently maintained for peace of mind and some models even have options to make payments to other Wallet account holders, making them ideal for quick transactions on the go, or when Bitcoin is the preferred method of payment and a wallet needs to be topped up.\n\nFeatured image credit: Unsplash"

        "content": "Litecoin\u2019s Strong Performance Before \u2018Halvening\u2019 Fuels Optimism for Bitcoin Rally\n\nLitecoin. Source: Adobe\n\nBitcoin (BTC) investors are closely watching the performance of Litecoin (LTC), another proof-of-work token, as the flagship cryptocurrency gears up for its upcoming \u201chalvening\u201d event.\n\nThe term \u201chalvening\u201d refers to the protocol-backed reduction in rewards for miners who successfully solve puzzles and add blocks to proof-of-work tokens like Litecoin and Bitcoin.\n\nThe Litecoin blockchain is poised to go through the halvening process in another 21 days, which is scheduled for August 1, 2023.\n\nThis reduction is designed to limit the number of tokens issued and has already caused a surge in Litecoin\u2019s price.\n\nOver the past month, the price of Litecoin has risen by 22%, while its 12-month performance shows an impressive 81% increase.\n\nThis performance has bolstered the confidence of Bitcoin investors who believe that the upcoming halvening event for Bitcoin, scheduled for April 2024, will have a similarly positive impact on the price of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin Price has Historically Reacted Positively to Halvenings\n\nBitcoin has historically experienced price increases following its halvenings, which occur every four years.\n\nThe reason for this trend lies in the fundamental principles of supply and demand.\n\nWith fewer new coins being minted, the existing supply becomes scarce. And as demand from investors and users continues to grow, this scarcity drives the price higher.\n\nThe first halvening in 2012 saw Bitcoin\u2019s price rise from around $12 to over $260 within a year.\n\nSimilarly, the second halvening in 2016 witnessed a surge from $650 to almost $20,000 by the end of 2017.\n\nThe most recent halvening occurred in May 2020 when the reward per block was reduced from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoins. While the immediate impact on the price was not as dramatic as previous halvenings, Bitcoin started an upward trend shortly after, reaching new all-time highs in 2021.\n\nBitcoin has also performed well since the start of the year.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, Bitcoin was trading at around $16,000. It has nearly doubled since then, recently hovering around $30,000.\n\nThe cryptocurrency hit a 52-week high last month after BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application to create a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe filing by the world\u2019s largest asset manager also spurred a surge in ETF applications, with other firms, such as Fidelity, Valkyrie, and Invesco, submitting applications.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Litecoin received a significant boost when EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by Citadel Securities, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab, announced that it would include them among the four tokens available to its customers at launch.\n\nNevertheless, as the countdown to Bitcoin\u2019s halvening in 2024 begins, industry watchers will be closely monitoring Litecoin as an indicator of what may lie ahead for the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency."

Where do these buyers currently stand at various price points, and how will the upcoming price movement impact their holdings?\n\nRead Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBitcoin accumulation at different range\n\nAs we examine the price movements of Bitcoin over the past year per Glassnode, an interesting pattern emerged. Initially, the cryptocurrency began the year at around $16,500, and during that period, approximately 637,000 BTC were purchased. The purchase accounted for roughly 3.71% of the total BTC in circulation.\n\nAs time progressed, and by the time March arrived, Bitcoin experienced a surge in price, reaching around $26,800. Approximately 523,000 BTC were acquired during this period, comprising 3.05% of the total supply.\n\nCurrently, around 592K #Bitcoin has a purchasing price of $30.2K the current spot price. This suggests small price fluctuations in either direction will send 3.45% of the circulating supply into a position of profit or loss respectively. ?

It\u2019s worth noting that approximately 592,000 BTC have been purchased at this price level, which accounted for approximately 3.45% of the total supply. What does this signify?\n\nIt implied that the BTC held by those who make up 3.5% of the total supply could swiftly transition from being profitable to incurring losses or vice versa, depending on the direction in which the price moves.\n\nLong and short-term Bitcoin holders hold at profit\n\nAnalyzing the Bitcoin 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) revealed an interesting trend. As of this writing, the 30-day MVRV was approximately 4.78%. This indicated that holders within this timeframe were currently holding their assets at a profit. This metric further suggested that even those who purchased their holdings at the current price range were still in a profitable position.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that these particular Bitcoin holders are also the ones most susceptible to the impact of price fluctuations in any direction.\n\nFurthermore, when the longer-term BTC MVRV was examined, specifically the 180-day MVRV, it became evident that holders within this timeframe enjoyed even greater profits. As of this writing, the 180-day MVRV was 11.9%. This indicated that these holders had amassed significant gains and were better positioned to withstand a price drop. Moreover, should the price of Bitcoin rise, they stand to benefit even more from their investments.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nBTC sees a positive trend\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $30,600 on a daily timeframe. While it had a profit of less than 1%, it was noteworthy that this marked the second consecutive day of trading in profit. Presently, Bitcoin was exhibiting an upward trend following its recent price movement.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator indicated a bearish divergence. Despite the bearish divergence, the Relative Strength Index indicated a bullish trend."

        "content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Standard Chartered Bank is ramping up its bullish Bitcoin prediction, targeting as much as US$120,000 (S$161,000) by the end of 2024 \u2013 almost quadruple the current price \u2013 as increasingly cash-rich miners reduce their sales of the token.\n\n\u201cIncreased miner profitability per BTC mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d StanChart analyst Geoff Kendrick wrote on Monday, using the abbreviation for the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process in which miners use powerful computers to validate transaction data on the Bitcoin blockchain, keeping the network running and earning the token as a reward.\n\nThey profit by selling the awarded Bitcoin into the market. When Bitcoin prices are higher, miners can cover costs selling fewer Bitcoin, holding on to more in the expectation of higher prices in the future.\n\nBold Bitcoin price predictions are nothing new. Among the most bullish is from Ark Investment Management founder Cathie Wood, who doubled down on her prediction that Bitcoin will hit US$1 million by 2030 as recently as November.\n\nStanChart forecast in April that Bitcoin could reach US$100,000 per coin by the end of 2024. This underestimated the impact that higher miner profitability would have on reducing the supply of Bitcoin in the marketplace, it now says, and expects the price to hit US$50,000 by the end of 2023 before jumping to as much as US$120,000 next year.\n\n\u201cAt recent prices, they (miners) have been selling 100 per cent of new BTC; at US$50,000 we think they would sell 20 per cent to 30 per cent,\u201d Mr Kendrick wrote.\n\nAdding to supply pressure is an upcoming \u201chalving\u201d in 2024, a preprogrammed event that will reduce the supply of Bitcoin rewards available to miners from about 900 a day to about 450. Occurring every four years, it keeps Bitcoin below its limit of 21 million tokens.\n\nBitcoin, the crypto sector\u2019s largest asset, was trading at US$30,309 as at 1.40pm in New York. Its 83 per cent gain in 2023 still leaves it well below its record high of nearly US$69,000 in November 2021.\n\nIts recent jump coincided with a raft of filings for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States, including an application by BlackRock, which has a near-pristine record of filing for and receiving approval for such funds.

        "content": "Dubai: The high price of a single Bitcoin has often made the crypto investment beyond the reach of most investors worldwide. This is why there has been a lot of interest in finding alternative ways to invest in Bitcoin and reduce the risks that come with directly buying the top cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is one such alternative. With it, investors can get exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to go through the trouble of setting up a wallet or dealing with erratic exchanges. But they are not without risks, flag industry experts.\n\nWhat are crypto ETFs? Cryptocurrency exchange traded funds (ETFs) track a single cryptocurrency or a basket of different digital tokens and currencies.\n\n\u201cBy buying shares of a Bitcoin ETF, you can gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin, but investors looking to utilise ETFs to access cryptocurrencies are not necessarily getting what wanted,\u201d explained Brian Deshell, a UAE-based cryptocurrency trader and analyst.\n\n\u201cInvestors should be convinced that by investing in a regulated product like a Bitcoin ETF, their money will be safe. However, it\u2019s not proven to be effective as means to exponentially grow your money in the crypto market. Moreover, there has hardly been any progress in regulatory approvals.\u201d\n\nInvestors should be convinced that by investing in a regulated product like a Bitcoin ETF, their money will be safe.\n\n10 years since launch, but hardly any progress\n\nIt was in mid-2013 when the first approval was sought for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. Although it\u2019s been a decade since the first application for an ETF was made, the US is still waiting for the first Bitcoin ETF product. The reason being the securities regulator isn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin ETFs have existed for some time outside the US, in Canada, Europe, and elsewhere in the world, they have failed to attract large investor interest,\u201d added Deshell. But why has interest suddenly sparked again in the investment?\n\nIn the last few weeks, over half a dozen new applications for a Bitcoin ETFs were filed in the US to the securities regulator. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, and US-based Fidelity Investments were the latest firms to apply.\n\nWhile any regulator worldwide has yet to approve such an ETF \u2013 despite receiving numerous applications \u2013 there is now more optimism the regulator will approve one because some of the previous concerns are assumed to have been addressed in recent filings, top investment bank JPMorgan noted recently.\n\nETF doesn\u2019t always mean a safer investment\n\n\u201cWhy investors are not convinced with Bitcoin ETFs as an investment is because they are not able to profit as much as those who buy Bitcoin directly. Bitcoin ETFs do not currently own Bitcoin itself as regulators are concerned that Bitcoin is traded on non-regulated crypto exchanges,\u201d added Deshell.\n\n\u201cInstead, Bitcoin ETFs own companies and other ETFs that are related to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. There is also the added risk of ETFs trading on the market, which adds to their volatility. In that case, mutual funds fare better as they are not traded directly on a stock exchange.\u201d\n\nAlthough a Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t a direct investment in cryptocurrency, it\u2019s still risky due to the exposure to Bitcoin, opined Brody Dunn, an investment manager at a UAE-based asset advisory firm, who went on to explain why.\n\n\u201cThose that may have been waiting to invest in Bitcoin ETFs and thought that this was the thing that\u2019s going to make it incredibly safe for them, without really doing the due diligence, that\u2019s where the concern is,\u201d cautioned Dunn.\n\nAlthough a Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t a direct investment in cryptocurrency, it\u2019s still risky due to the exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nBig investors may profit more from crypto ETFs\n\nThough Dunn notes that the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF is good for the overall Bitcoin and crypto market, he warns that it may not benefit investors individually.\n\n\u201cAn ETF is going to drive more of that institutional money in, but they\u2019re going to make a ton of money,\u201d he added. \u201cIt does help the market, but what about the average investor? It\u2019s supposed to help them, but that\u2019s not necessarily what is happening here.\u201d\n\nCrypto experts like Deshell, along with some others in the crypto community, agree with Dunn. Some argue that the major firms involved in a potential ETF investment, including hedge funds and providers, would benefit more than individual investors.\n\n\u201cDirect exposure is the best way for a new investor to get into Bitcoin,\u201d Dunn added. \u201cBitcoin ETF is just a product to help hedge funds and other middlemen make more money, and newbie investors shouldn\u2019t be buying without understanding.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETF is just a product to help hedge funds and other middlemen make more money, and newbie investors shouldn\u2019t be buying without understanding - Brody Dunn, an investment manager\n\nBottom line: Good to buy Bitcoin ETFs now?\n\n\u201cIf you don't want to actively manage your crypto investment, but you want a way to diversify your portfolio with a high-risk, high-reward asset, a Bitcoin ETF is a better option than directly buying Bitcoin,\u201d said Deshell.\n\nAmong the several benefits of Bitcoin ETFs, the key perks are low cost of ownership, being able to diversify your crypto investments, while having somebody with knowledge of the market to manage them, which also enables you to save time picking crypto tokens.\n\n\u201cAlso, owning crypto ETFs saves investors from costs like network charges and transaction fees. An ETF provider is responsible for the safety of the fund, offering a sense of security to investors. These are factors that should drive you to invest. But it isn\u2019t always that straight-forward,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETFs are now observed to amplify volatility in prices and create risks for investors if the fund is a large share of the market. Recent trends suggest that ETFs can exacerbate price movements and create additional volatility when they have a large footprint in the underlying asset.\u201d"

        "title": "Sector Report: Liquid Staking - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Executive Summary: Ethereum staking has attracted almost $35 billion since December 2020. With low barriers of entry, Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) account for over 30% of the total staked ETH. Lido Finance, the leader, has $13 billion worth of ETH in its staking pools.\n\nAs liquid staking becomes more popular than ever, we explore this sector in detail and provide a balanced investor thesis. We also take a closer look at other alternatives to Lido, like Rocket Pool, Coinbase cbETH, StakeWise, and Frax Ether.\n\nIndustry Overview\n\nThe rise of liquid staking protocols was driven by the launch of the Ethereum Beacon Chain in December 2020. When the world\u2019s second most popular blockchain switched from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, it created exciting new opportunities for crypto users to stake their crypto to generate additional income.\n\nHowever, the initial requirements put staking beyond the reach of smaller crypto investors. To run a staking node, an investor needed to commit at least 32 ETH, for a minimum lockup period of 2 years. Liquid staking protocols were created to get around these limitations, and make staking accessible to anyone with ETH.\n\nAccording to Coincarp.com, there are an estimated 233 million ETH holders today. With their ability to democratize staking and make it more accessible, liquid staking protocols tap directly into this massive user base. Not surprisingly, these protocols have attracted over $17.8 billion worth of ETH in just over 2.5 years.\n\nThe sector received a major boost in April 2023, with the activation of the Shapella upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain. It marked the culmination of Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake and ended the lockup period for staked tokens. The freedom to withdraw staked tokens at any time has further increased the interest in ETH staking. And since running a node still requires 32 ETH, liquid staking protocols continue to be a great option for smaller crypto investors.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the popularity of liquid staking protocols is the prospect of unlocked liquidity through native tokens. Users who stake ETH on these protocols receive an equal amount of a native token whose value is linked to ETH. For example, when you lock ETH into Coinbase, you receive a new token called cbETH in return. These tokens can be further invested in DeFi projects, while the underlying ETH continues to earn staking rewards.\n\n(Note: like all derivatives, there is a danger that the staking token could collapse, making it difficult to get your ETH back.)\n\nWith over 7.16 million ETH staked, Lido is the dominant player in the liquid staking space by a wide margin. The protocol enjoys a commanding 74.17% share of the market, as it was an early mover. Coinbase Wrapped Staked Ether and Rocket Pool are the other main players, with 1.1 million and 762,000 staked ETH, respectively.\n\nLiquid staking protocols continue to enjoy sustained interest from users, equaling decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in total value locked (TVL). The TVL of all DEXs is around $17.47 billion as of this writing, equal to the combined TVL of all staking protocols, according to CoinTelegraph reports.\n\nEven as the money keeps pouring in, storm clouds loom large on the horizon of liquid staking and DeFi in general. Regulators in the US are taking an aggressive stance towards major crypto platforms in the aftermath of the collapse of FTX and Terra/LUNA. With lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase and a new bipartisan bill in Congress, plenty is happening on the regulatory front. Future developments in this space could profoundly alter the course of cryptocurrencies and liquid staking protocols.\n\nTop Liquid Staking Projects\n\nProject TVL Market Share Market Cap (circulating) Assets Staked (annualized) Revenue Commission Rate (on rewards) Lido $13.23b 74.17% $1.90b $12.33b $68.40m 10% Coinbase Wrapped $2.11b 11.42% N/A $2.16b N/A 25% Rocket Pool $1.41b 7.90% $921.25m $1.30b N/A 14% Frax Ether $439.53m 2.47% N/A $397m $1.65m 10% Stakewise $167.92m 0.94% $21.31m $166m $976k 10%\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nMark Twain said, \u201cWhen everybody is digging for gold, it\u2019s good to be in the pick and shovel business.\u201d While everyone is searching for yield from ETH staking, it\u2019s good to be invested in the businesses that provide them with the tools to do so.\n\nCrypto investors have three opportunities:\n\n1) They can stake ETH with these services, receive the companion token, then sell the token back when they want to claim the \u201cinterest.\u201d For example, you stake your ETH with Lido, receive stETH in return, then unstake it when you want to claim the rewards.\n\n2) They can stake ETH, receive the companion token, then reinvest the stETH elsewhere. You stake your ETH with Lido, receive stETH in return, then reinvest the stETH in other Web3 product. (Higher risk, potentially higher reward.)\n\n3) Or they can simply buy the project\u2019s token, which is like investing in the underlying \u201ccompany.\u201d For Lido, just buy and hold LDO for the long term.\n\nThe latter is the picks-and-shovels play, betting that the yields on staking protocols will turn these leading projects into a key piece of the long-term financial infrastructure.\n\nWe believe these platforms have a promising future, as the staking rewards from ETH typically range from around 4.00% APY in staking pools to as high as 8.00% for validator nodes. As a set-it-and-forget-it source of income, ETH staking is superior to savings accounts and competes on favorable terms with even US treasury bond yields. However, the potential risk is still far greater with crypto holdings, as we\u2019ll see below.\n\nRisks of Liquid Staking\n\nLiquidity Risks\n\nAll liquid staking tokens suffer from high liquidity risk. This is a direct result of low supply when compared to the actual cryptocurrency involved (ETH, in most cases). Many of the trading markets for staking tokens may also be poorly developed with low trading volumes, further reducing the holder\u2019s ability to quickly sell the tokens at a favorable price.\n\nDeFi Market Risks\n\nThe entire rationale of investing in liquid staking hinges on its ability to free up funds for DeFi protocols. And DeFi investing is an incredibly high-risk/high-reward endeavor. Although potential rewards are often astronomically high, with APYs above 20%, the risks are also high. If you lose your staking tokens, you automatically lose access to the ETH held on the liquid staking protocol.\n\nValidator Risks\n\nInvestors in liquid staking pools rely on third-party validators to bring in the staking rewards. If the validator is inefficient, error-prone, or in rare instances malicious, it could result in losses for the participants in the staking pools. The losses can range in severity from a minor decrease in reward APY to wholesale forfeiture of invested ETH through a penalty called \u201cslashing.\u201d\n\nLegal Risk\n\nMajor regulators around the world, particularly in the EU and the United States, are starting to crack down on cryptocurrency projects and businesses. There are also concerns that the exchange of ETH for an ERC-20 token could be considered a taxable event. Now, the SEC is arguing that liquid staking protocols fall into the category of securities, and could be subject to strict regulations.\n\nWho\u2019s Investing: Institutional Backing\n\nLiquid staking protocols are generally geared toward smaller crypto investors. Given the immense possibilities of the retail market, these protocols have received considerable backing from institutional investors.\n\nLido leads the pack here as well, having received over $160 million in funding across multiple rounds from major investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Dragonfly Capital, and Paradigm. Coinbase Wrapped Ether is a protocol owned by the CEX Coinbase, a major entity with a market cap of $12.49 billion in 2023.\n\nRocket Pool is a fully decentralized protocol that received seed funding from Consensys Capital in the early days of 2018. Since then, it has largely remained operational without seeking any external funding.\n\nStakewise has also received funding to the tune of $2 million to date, from investors like Blockdaemon and Boldstart Ventures. Finally, the Frax Ether protocol is operated by Frax Finance, a blockchain company specializing in stablecoins.\n\nTop Liquid Staking Protocols\n\nLido (LDO)\n\nTVL: $13.26b\n\nAssets Staked: $12.33b\n\nDaily Active Users: 451\n\nLDO Price: $2.22\n\nTwitter Followers: 145.9k\n\nLido was the first ever non-custodial staking protocol for ETH. It launched soon after the Beacon Chain and has dominated the sector ever since. Lido accounts for 29% of the entire ETH staking market.\n\nThe native staking token on Lido is called stETH. The protocol charges a standard 10% fee on staking rewards. LDO is the governance token on the protocol. Holders can vote on the future trajectory of upgrades and features on the protocol.\n\nLido has grown massively after the Shapella upgrade, but all that growth comes at a price. With a small pool of around 30 validators, the project is becoming increasingly centralized. And as it gains even more market share in staked ETH, some think this centralization could pose a threat to Ethereum\u2019s decentralized architecture.\n\nAccording to Vitalik Buterin and other major figures associated with Ethereum, protocols should ideally not exceed 15% to 20% in their share of the ETH staking market. Lido is double that limit and shows no sign of slowing down. Consequently, it may not be the best option for staking from a long-term sustainability perspective.\n\nCoinbase Wrapped Staked Ether (cbETH) Coinbase Wrapped Staked Ether (cbETH)\n\nTVL: $2.14b\n\nAssets Staked: $2.16b\n\nDaily Active Users: N/A\n\nDAO Token Price: N/A\n\nTwitter Followers: 5.8m\n\nCoinbase is the leading U.S. crypto exchange, launched in 2012 by Brian Armstrong. The exchange announced its liquid staking protocol in June 2022. The token representing staked ETH on the platform is called cbETH.\n\nThe protocol has managed to rapidly increase the number of users since launch. Although Lido is beyond reach at this point, Coinbase has posted impressive growth to capture the second spot ahead of older, more established protocols like Rocket Pool.\n\nSince it is owned by a centralized exchange, the protocol does not have a DAO or governing token. Apart from cbETH, Coinbase has also launched a liquid staking protocol for institutional investors with the ERC-20 token lsETH.\n\nRegarding the future of the protocol, Coinbase is currently facing a lawsuit from the SEC and its future remains a bit unclear at the time of this writing. The prospects of the staking protocol will hinge heavily on the outcome of the lawsuit.\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nTVL: $923.51m\n\nAssets Staked: $1.30b\n\nDaily Active Users: 56\n\nRPL Price: $47.51\n\nTwitter Followers: 42.2k\n\nAmong the major liquid staking protocols, Rocket Pool is the only one that ticks all the boxes of a truly decentralized, non-custodial protocol. It has over 2,000 validators and anyone can become one, unlike Lido which relies on a limited pool of validators. However, it is much harder to use.\n\nThe protocol also has additional steps in place to protect stakers from poorly performing validators. The DAO of the protocol uses a governance token called RPL. The ERC-20 token used to provide liquidity to stakers is called rETH.\n\nFor users who care about decentralization, there is no better choice than Rocket Pool in liquid staking. However, the protocol is held back by its relatively higher fees (15%) and slightly lower returns than other platforms.\n\nIn terms of future growth, Rocket Pool is relatively well-placed. It doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the blockchain and has a high proportion of validators. The main threat here is future regulations, which is a common issue for all such protocols.\n\nFrax Ether (FXS)\n\nTVL: $446M\n\nAssets Staked: $397M\n\nDaily Active Users: 27\n\nDAO Token Price: N/A\n\nTwitter Followers: 72.7k\n\nOutside the top 3, the liquid staking protocols all have TVL under $1 billion. Frax Ether is the leader of the chasing pack with a TVL above $400 million. It was launched by Frax Finance, a decentralized finance protocol specializing in partially algorithmic stablecoins.\n\nFrax Ether protocol uses a unique (and rather complex) model for its staking process. It involves a dual-token system made up of sfrxETH (interest-bearing token) and frxETH (farming token).\n\nThrough the innovative system, Frax Ether promises higher APY rewards than its competitors. But in terms of popularity and growth, it faces an uphill battle against protocols like Lido. However, the data does show a steady growth trajectory for Frax.\n\nOne detraction is Frax Finance\u2019s former association with algorithmic stablecoins. The Frax community voted in February 2023 to move away from algorithmic stablecoins entirely and focus on fully collateralized versions instead. Our opinion is that was the right move to build trust and confidence.\n\nStakeWise (SWISE)\n\nTVL: $171m\n\nAssets Staked: $166m\n\nDaily Active Users: 8\n\nSWISE Price: $0.0803\n\nTwitter Followers: 10k\n\nLaunched in 2021, StakeWise is a smaller liquid staking protocol on the Ethereum and Gnosis blockchains. The founders and developers of the project are based in Tallinn, Estonia. The protocol uses an overcollateralized staking derivative called osETH.\n\nThe developers are currently testing V3 of StakeWise, a monumental upgrade that will revamp a lot of its features and make the protocol more friendly towards solo stakers. The vision of StakeWise developers is to combat the growing centralization within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nUsers who deposit ETH in StakeWise\u2019s Vaults get an overcollateralized token called osETH in exchange. This token will grant access to DeFi projects and apps. A successful V3 upgrade has the potential to improve StakeWise\u2019s appeal among stakers who seek decentralized protocols.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nLiquid staking has proven attractive in recent years because it allows users to earn two rewards at the same time: staking rewards and DeFi rewards. You earn staking rewards by locking up your ETH, and you can earn DeFi rewards by re-investing the corresponding token.\n\nBut with the new EU MiCA laws and the SEC crackdown on CEXs in the United States, there is a high degree of uncertainty on the regulatory front. Any investment decision should take into account the potential impact regulations could have on crypto, especially liquid staking protocols, from a tax and legal perspective.\n\nIf you really want to invest in these protocols, the better play may simply be to buy and hold a little bit of the underlying governance token (i.e., buying LDO to invest in the Lido \u201ccompany\u201d).\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the blockchain revolution!

        "title": "Bitcoin mining - a catalyst for economic growth? - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining \u2013 a catalyst for economic growth?\n\nBitcoin presents a unique opportunity for the United Kingdom. Its potential goes beyond being a decentralised form of payment; it can drive renewable energy development, create jobs, and generate tax revenue.\n\nBy understanding the value and potential of Bitcoin, the UK government can position itself as a leader in the evolving digital payment space.\n\nThe global market for the Bitcoin mining industry alone is valued at $1.92 billion (\u00a31.53 billion) and is predicted to rise to $7 billion (\u00a35.56 billion) by 2032. However, the UK currently holds a meagre share of 0.23% in Bitcoin mining, lagging behind smaller nations.\n\nIt is crucial for the UK government to recognise the economic growth potential within this sector and take action to attract investment and foster job creation. By doing so, the UK can tap into this emerging market and establish itself as a significant player in Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe environmental advantage\n\nContrary to popular misconceptions, Bitcoin mining can be an ally to the UK\u2019s renewable energy ambitions. The country faces the challenge of intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, which necessitates overbuilding the supply to ensure a consistent energy flow.\n\nBitcoin miners can play a crucial role by co-locating with renewable energy plants, monetising surplus power, and providing an ideal demand response. By maximising the utilisation of renewable energy sources, Bitcoin mining can contribute to a greener energy grid and help reduce emissions.\n\nRegulation for success\n\nTo unlock the potential of Bitcoin mining and attract large-scale miners, the UK requires clear and effective regulation. The country\u2019s contacts with large Bitcoin mining entities emphasise the need for regulatory clarity and highlight the interest in utilising the UK\u2019s wasted and stranded energy.\n\nBy treating Bitcoin mining on par with data or AI computer centres, the UK can create a conducive environment for miners to thrive. A prime example of innovative mining solutions is Scilling Mining, which uses agricultural waste to power miners, directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBy embracing such practices, the UK can position itself as a global leader in sustainable cryptocurrency mining.\n\nMitigating wind energy challenges\n\nThe UK faces challenges in efficiently harnessing wind energy due to limitations in the power transmission network.\n\nThe curtailment of wind turbines on the windiest days costs the National Grid \u00a3215 million annually, ultimately burdening consumers through higher energy bills. However, strategically locating Bitcoin mining operations near wind farms can provide a solution.\n\nBy absorbing excess energy during peak production, Bitcoin mining can optimise wind energy utilisation and generate additional revenue. This symbiotic relationship between wind energy and Bitcoin mining can address grid infrastructure limitations while bolstering economic growth.\n\nThe road to a greener future\n\nEmbracing careful regulations that encompass Bitcoin mining and AI compute centres can lead the UK towards a greener future. Beyond fostering job creation and generating tax revenue, this approach can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCutting methane (CH4) emissions, in particular, is crucial for slowing down climate change, and the UK\u2019s significant sources of CH4 include the oil & gas industry, landfills, and agriculture. By implementing sustainable Bitcoin mining practices, the UK can make significant strides in reducing emissions from these sectors.\n\nIt is important to recognise that Bitcoin\u2019s energy use should not be compared to that of a single country, as it is a global network.\n\nComparing it to the energy consumption of individual countries can be misleading. In reality, Bitcoin uses only 0.22% of global energy, highlighting its relatively low energy footprint compared to larger countries like China and the US.\n\nUnderstanding this perspective is crucial to accurately assess the energy impact of Bitcoin and its potential role in a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe security level of the Bitcoin network has experienced a significant increase of over 200% (211% more mining power added) since 2017.\n\nRemarkably, during this period, the emission intensity of the network, which measures greenhouse gas emissions per kilowatt-hour (KWH), has actually decreased by 4%.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy embracing Bitcoin mining, the UK can unlock opportunities for economic growth, renewable energy development, and emissions reduction.\n\nWith the right regulatory framework and strategic partnerships, the UK can position itself as a leader in sustainable cryptocurrency mining.\n\nIt is time to recognise the value and potential of Bitcoin, harness its benefits, and pave the way for a greener and more prosperous future for the United Kingdom."

        "title": "Vanguard: investment in Bitcoin mining - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Yesterday, it was revealed that Vanguard has increased its investment in Bitcoin mining companies Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Blockchain.\n\nThe Vanguard Group and increased exposure to Bitcoin mining\n\nThe Vanguard Group (often just called Vanguard) is one of the world\u2019s largest investment companies.\n\nIt is based in the US, and has about $7.7 trillion in assets under management.\n\nVanguard was founded in 1975 in Pennsylvania, and to date is the largest provider of mutual funds, and the second largest provider of ETFs after BlackRock\u2019s iShares.\n\nIt also offers brokerage, educational account services, financial planning, wealth management, and trust services.\n\nIn addition, several mutual funds managed by Vanguard have ranked among the top US mutual funds by assets under management, and along with BlackRock and State Street it is considered one of the big three index fund managers with a dominant role in the US.\n\nA special characteristic is that since it is owned by the funds it manages, it is actually owned by its clients.\n\nBitcoin mining and Vanguard\u2019s commitment\n\nThe company began investing in Bitcoin mining in 2020, which was before the last big bull run.\n\nIn particular, it invested by buying shares in mining companies, such as Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Blockchain.\n\nA couple of days ago these two companies released documents revealing that Vanguard has increased its investment in the companies.\n\nRegarding Marathon Digital Holdings, the document reveals that Vanguard now owns as many as 17.5 million shares, or 10.31% of the total.\n\nIt is therefore not the single largest shareholder, but it now holds a significant enough share to be the single largest shareholder in the company, ahead of even BlackRock.\n\nAs for Riot Blockchain, the other document reveals that Vanguard now owns as many as 17.9 million shares, or 10.24% of the total. Again, it is not the single largest shareholder, but the single largest shareholder in the company, also ahead of BlackRock.\n\nIt is worth noting that not only is it now by far the single largest shareholder in both companies, but also that the second largest shareholder is BlackRock, which is the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\nThis means that industrial Bitcoin mining is of great interest to investment funds.\n\nInvestments in Bitcoin mining\n\nAnother particularly interesting fact is about Vanguard\u2019s increased investment in these two companies.\n\nIn fact, thanks to the latest investment, the company has increased the number of shares it owns in Marathon Digital Holdings from 10.97 million to 17.5, an increase of almost 60%. In contrast, as for Riot Blockchain, it increased from 15.2 million to 17.9 million shares, an increase of 18%.\n\nThese are therefore significant increases, which may sound strange in view of next year\u2019s halving.\n\nIndeed, with the halving of spring 2024, the reward received by miners who manage to validate a block is halved from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, and this will inevitably reduce miner earnings.\n\nIt is precisely because of this that the competition will get tougher, given that Bitcoin mining is a competition, which will probably drive smaller miners out of the market in favor of larger ones.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings and Riot Blockchain are in fact among the largest US miners, and the world\u2019s largest computing power dedicated to this activity is concentrated in the US.\n\nParadoxically, therefore, it could be companies like Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Blockchain that stand to gain the most from the halving, thanks in part to new, more efficient machines that, requiring large investments, will be within the reach of these giants in particular.\n\nAt this point, Vanguard\u2019s decision to increase its exposure to Bitcoin industrial mining is not all that surprising.\n\nThe impact on the price of BTC\n\nWhile this news in itself might not have any significant impact on the price of Bitcoin, the reasoning behind it might suggest that traditional finance giants like Vanguard expect new increases.\n\nThen again, it is no coincidence that the company entered the industry precisely in 2020, which is the year of the previous halving, before the last big bullrun was triggered.\n\nFor example, Marathon Digital Holdings\u2019 stock price in the past three years has risen 1,900%, while Riot Blockchain\u2019s stock price has risen 725%.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, today in pre-market both are up slightly.\n\nGiven that these increases are due precisely to an increase in the value of Bitcoin, it is possible to imagine that Vanguard\u2019s further investments reveal the company\u2019s hope that it will again be able to make money from them, even and especially from further increases in the value of the price of BTC."
