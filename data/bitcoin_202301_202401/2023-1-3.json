        "title": "Happy Birthday, Bitcoin: Top Cryptocurrency Turns 14 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Bitcoin fans celebrated the top cryptocurrency's 14th year on Jan. 3 with swarms of birthday posts on social media, signaling the digital asset's resilience even after a prolonged slump in value.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways The genesis block of Bitcoin (BTC) was mined on Jan. 3, 2009; that date in 2023 marked its 14th birthday.\n\nThe asset and its blockchain technology have had a profound impact on the world and survived multiple challenges.\n\nAdoption of Bitcoin continues to increase, with more companies and countries buying in to the asset.\n\nThe crypto community has celebrated the occasion, predicting many more years of growth for Bitcoin.\n\nA Humble Start\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the famed and mysterious Bitcoin creator, mined the first block of Bitcoin on Jan. 3, 2009.Nakamoto received 50 BTC as a reward for the genesis block\u2014a holding that would be a massive sum by today\u2019s standards for the token's value.\n\nHis reward can't be spent because Satoshi didn't send the transaction from the genesis block to the global transaction database. It is unclear whether this was intentional.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's Price History. Investopedia / Hugo Lin\n\nSurviving Many Challenges\n\nPredictably, a novel asset such as Bitcoin would, at some point, encounter resistance and obstacles. And it did, on several occasions, especially during its early years. Bitcoin\u2019s price tumbled in some particularly notable incidents\u2014but its highs continue to outshine the lows. The theme of the cryptocurrency\u2019s ability to recover strongly after bear markets began to cement themselves during those early years.\n\nThe very first Bitcoin transaction took place in October 2009 when a Finnish computer science student named Martti Malmi sold 5,050 BTC, giving each coin a valuation of $0.0009.\n\nOne of the most notable early real-world transactions occurred in 2010 when the now-famous Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. At today\u2019s value, that would work out to about $167.3 million. The purchase has become a crypto community event is marked on May 22 as Bitcoin Pizza Day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Bitcoin reached a $1 valuation, which happened in February 2011. Shortly afterward, the asset's price climbed to $10 and then to $30, leading to a leap of 30 times for that year. In 2013, it crossed $1,000 per token.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin\u2019s $1,000 mark pales compared with its more recent valuation levels. The all-time high of just under $69,000 was reached in 2021. While it may be much lower than that now, many investors are optimistic, especially given the continued broadening of adoption.\n\n\n\nA Rapid Explosion in Adoption and Awareness\n\nOne of the reasons there is growing optimism about Bitcoin is the fact that adoption and awareness don't seem to be stagnating, even as the asset's price does. From the launch of the world\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM in 2013 to the fact that the Bitcoin symbol was encoded in Unicode, an international encoding standard that assigned unique symbols for use in different languages across various platforms and programs, the cryptocurrency has found a place in the public consciousness.\n\nThen came the initially slow, but now rapid, parade of companies investing in or accepting Bitcoin for payment. That list includes Tesla, Block, and MicroStrategy, to name a few. These companies have played a big part in boosting awareness of Bitcoin and persuading those on the fence about Bitcoin to try it.\n\nBitcoin also has made advances on a governmental level. El Salvador famously made Bitcoin legal tender, and it continues to bet on the asset. More recently, the Central African Republic also named Bitcoin as legal tender, much to the surprise of some of the world\u2019s authorities.\n\nTwitter Community Celebrates\n\nThe crypto community on Twitter always erupts into celebration when Bitcoin's birthday arrives, from the average retail investor to the most prominent names holding the asset.\n\nFor example, this Jan. 3, \"Bitcoin maximalist\" and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy (MSTR) Michael Saylor called Bitcoin ''Digital Gold'' on Twitter. Bitcoin \"Maxis\" believe that Bitcoin is the only digital asset that will be needed in the future. Prominent \"Ethereum Maxi\" Evan Luthra tweeted about how Bitcoin's birth permanently changed the world.\n\nAlso on Bitcoin's latest birthday, one of Ukraine's largest pharmacy chains, ANC, announced that it now will accept Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nOf course, recently, the price of BTC hasn\u2019t been much to celebrate. Bitcoin trudged through the 2022 holiday season below $17,000. However, it started the new year on a slightly more optimistic note, which investors will hope could be the start of a bull run.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin's short life has been eventful. The cryptocurrency is likely to encounter many more years of growth, and steadily expanding adoption will do much to encourage that. Bitcoin\u2019s 14th birthday is just another milestone in what could play out as a long life for the groundbreaking financial asset.\n\n"

        "title": "How much did I lose on my 2022 bitcoin investment? It's complicated - ZDNet",
        "content": "Getty Images\n\nThis was supposed to be an easy article to write. In January of 2022, I spent a few bucks investing in bitcoin. My plan back then was to wait a year, and then write an article (this one, in fact) showing how much I gained (or lost) over the course of the year. It was to be stunt writing at its best.\n\nSpecial Feature The Tech Trends to Watch in 2023 Learn about the leading tech trends the world will lean into over the next 12 months and how they will affect your life and your job. Read now\n\nBut that's not how its turning out. Oh, sure. I lost a huge percentage of my investment. But I can't just throw bitcoin (or even cryptocurrency in general) under the bus and claim that crypto is a bad investment. That's because a wide range of investments (especially tech) plummeted in 2022.\n\nWe're way beyond the scope of a \"correction,\" where the market adjusts for an unexpected bout of exuberance. But we're not at the legendary (but not necessarily true) tulip craze either, where investors get their comeuppance for believing in some bonkersly stupid investment idea.\n\nNo, we're at the beginning of 2023 and much of the market has tanked. This isn't a tulip or crypto or craze sort of story. Instead, it's a story about the vagaries of investment and how you need to be careful where you put your hard-earned money.\n\nMy bitcoin journey\n\nOn January 1, 2022, I bought $50 worth of bitcoin through PayPal. That was an interesting process all on its own. It cost me a buck fifteen in fees to make the purchase, so all-in, I spent $51.15 to embark upon this grand experiment.\n\nSee also:\n\nWithin minutes, I lost 25 cents. After one night, my losses amounted to a whole 32 cents. But, of course, that was just the beginning.\n\nI next checked in seven days later and my investment had dropped again. This time, I was down a total of $7.08, for a 13.84% drop. I checked again at the end of January, and my holdings had dropped again. In three weeks, my losses doubled. I was down $14.38, for a total drop of 28.11%.\n\nThen, I waited. I gave it a full six months. Exactly six months into my bitcoin investment, I checked into my vast holdings. As of July 1, my $50 was worth $20.30. My portfolio had lost 60.31% of its value.\n\nNow, we're at a full year. I haven't looked at the value of my bitcoin since July. Let's check it together. I'm about to login to PayPal and take a look.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nWell, that's interesting. My bitcoin investment lost 60.31% percent of its value in the first six months of my holding it. But it lost only another 5.63% in the second six months. My bitcoin investment is now worth only a paltry $17.42.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nConsidering how volatile it was during the first six months (and especially the first month of 2022), it's been remarkably stable these last six months.\n\nThe rest of the story\n\nNow is the time when I expected to mock bitcoin. After all, losing 60.31% of your investment in six months is a terrible loss. I expected to discuss how it would be better to invest in something that wasn't totally fake, yada, yada, yada.\n\nBut life isn't that simple.\n\nOkay, look. I'm about to start discussing stock values and investments, so a massive disclaimer is in order. I am not a stocks or investment expert. I'm not telling you any of this to give you investment advice. I'm just reporting on behavior based on publicly available data. So, before you go betting your money on anything I talk about, think again.\n\nFrankly, beyond the fifty bucks I gambled away on bitcoin, I have no other investments. I'm not big on gambling. Since I don't have confidence in my ability to spot a sure thing, I've avoided investing in stocks and crypto altogether. End disclaimer.\n\nLet's get back to the whole crypto investment theme. To do that, we need to take a pause and look at the news of the day.\n\nWhen the markets closed for the final time in 2022 on Friday, investors were shaken by how much of a beating they'd taken overall. CNBC reported, \"Stocks fall to end Wall Street's worst year since 2008.\"\n\nIf you look at the major indexes (the Dow, S&P, and NASDAQ), all were down for 2022. These are aggregated indexes of companies across industries and, as such, reflect business performance overall.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nBut these are index stocks, which means their value is representative of the movement of all their members. If some members do great, but most do poorly, then the entire index will trend down.\n\nThe biggest tech stocks did particularly badly in 2022. Apple lost 26% of its value, Amazon lost almost half, and Meta (Facebook) dropped almost 65%. IBM, on the other hand, did particularly well.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nStocks across other industries had more varied performance. Retailers like Home Depot and Walmart lost value, but health providers and oil companies continued to grow in value. This list is far from comprehensive, but it helps showcase that parts of the economy did rather well, even as investment performance in tech -- particularly the top tier big names -- didn't do as well.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nSo, the top-line conclusion is simple. Investing is something of a gamble. You could gain a lot. For example, if you'd invested $1,000 in Exxon Mobile at the beginning of the year, you'd have $1,802 today.\n\nBut if you'd invested that same $1,000 in Tesla last January (and yes, we all know the whole Twitter/Musk story is part of this), you'd have only $349 left.\n\nBut you can't blame all of tech stock's loss on Musk. A thousand dollars invested in Facebook a year ago would have been worth only $357 today.\n\nDavid Gewirtz/ZDNET\n\nThis is why investing seems like gambling to me. Last January, I considered my bitcoin investment to be an experiment for the benefit of ZDNET readers. I thought there was a (very) slim chance I might make a few bucks, but I was pretty convinced I'd lose a few instead.\n\nBut had you asked me whether my bitcoin investment was more chancy than, say, an investment in Tesla, I would have told you \"sure.\" After all, bitcoin is all magic rainbows and unicorns. It's imaginary currency and nothing is real. On the other hand, Tesla makes fine cars and has factories and technology and such.\n\nThe idea that a thousand dollar investment in Tesla stock on January 1, 2022 would have the same value on January 1, 2023 (within pennies) of a thousand dollars invested in Bitcoin would have seemed ludicrous.\n\nAlso: Elon Musk's Tesla has sold 75% of its Bitcoin: Here's why\n\nAs I said, you can't blame it all on Elon Musk, no matter how much he seems like a comic book villain. A thousand bucks invested in Facebook last January is worth just a few bucks more than a thousand dollars invested in bitcoin, and Musk had nothing directly to do with that collapse.\n\nTiming matters, of course. Back in the day, I actually started my first company using the profits I made from an Apple stock investment. But had I made that investment in Apple in 2022, I wouldn't have had any profits to use to start much of anything.\n\nInvestment is about (hopefully) buying low and selling high. It's not about buying according to a calendar entry. So no sane investor would buy on January 1, 2022 and plan on selling on January 1, 2023. Instead, a good investor would expect to hold onto an investment until it's time to sell. That concept became such an issue of controversy among crypto enthusiasts, though, that a misspelling of the word \"hold\" launched a mocking meme for traditional investment strategy, HODL (hold on for dear life), in response.\n\nSo, what does it all mean?\n\nI started this experiment at the beginning of 2022 expecting to show you that cryptocurrency was a much less reliable investment than more traditional investment vehicles. I'm ending 2022 showing you that it's all a crap shoot.\n\nMy experiment was, essentially, a data gathering expedition that didn't come home with reliable results. I can't tell you to avoid crypto. I can't tell you to invest in crypto. I can't tell you to avoid stocks. I can't tell you to invest in stocks.\n\nWhat I can tell you is this: if you have no idea, don't risk your money. Unless you know a lot more about stocks and investment and crypto than I apparently do, hang onto your cash or invest it in whatever is considered safe these days. That's probably something like mutual funds, but at this point, I wouldn't feel comfortable making any kind of recommendation.\n\nDo your research. Ask around. Listen to your gut. And definitely don't invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nThat said, I have a good overall feeling about 2023. Have a great year, folks!\n\nHow are you feeling about cryptocurrency investments after 2022? What are your plans for 2023? Let us know in the comments below.

        "title": "Bitcoin Halvings Are Bull Market Things \u2014 Will This Time Be Different? - Blockworks",
        "content": "This bear market is brutal. Top cryptocurrencies are down more than 70%, dramatic bankruptcies have left potentially millions out of pocket and bitcoin miner capitulation looks more likely by the day.\n\nBut just how brutal? Previous boom-and-bust cycles add perspective.\n\nBlockworks analyzed bitcoin price data stretching back to 2010 \u2014 when bitcoin (BTC) was worth a fraction of a dollar \u2014 to model exactly how long each bull and bear market lasted.\n\nThe current bear market has lasted 335 days, so far, dating back to Feb. 3, 2022. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 55% since, from nearly $36,300 to a low of $15,550.\n\nWe\u2019re not quite in the territory of the longest bitcoin bear market on record. That title belongs to the previous big bear, a 390-day stretch between Feb. 21, 2018 and Mar. 18, 2019. Bitcoin tanked from $10,250 to a local bottom of below $3,200 over that period, a 70% drop.\n\nOur methodology: We mapped existing definitions for the start of a bear market from the traditional finance world. So, a bear market begins when an asset trades 20% below its recent high for more than two months.\n\nRiffing on this metric, a bear market ends when an asset trades 20% above its recent low for one month or more. And, for the purposes of this (basic) exercise, a bull market begins as soon as a bear market is no more.\n\nGreen is for bull, red is for bear | Chart by David Canellis\n\nIt\u2019s an imperfect model for crypto bear markets overall, considering we\u2019ve only charted bitcoin. But considering BTC persists as the ecosystem\u2019s bellwether asset, it serves as a decent guide.\n\nBut here\u2019s what it does mean: We\u2019re around two months shy of the longest bitcoin bear market.\n\nEver.\n\nNot like the other bears\n\nTo Peter Eberle, chief investment officer at crypto investment firm Castle Funds, bitcoin is in a stronger position now than in previous prolonged down periods.\n\nSo much leverage has already been unwound across the board by defunct crypto lenders and exchanges, and embattled firms have already liquidated quality assets, such as bitcoin and ether, to meet redemptions.\n\n\u201cA big difference that we have seen between the bear market of 2018-2019 is how this time institutions did not back away from projects that they were building,\u201d Eberle told Blockworks. \u201cIn 2018, most institutions building BTC infrastructure just gave up because they believed the industry was dead. This time they may have put the brakes on some projects, but they did not abandon them.\u201d\n\nIn making his care, Eberle highlighted major moves forward from the likes of Fidelity, which launched commission-free crypto trading for retail clients last November. BNY Mellon also shared plans to custody bitcoin for clients.\n\n\u201cThese two developments have enormous implications, but were overshadowed by the FTX fraud,\u201d Eberle said.\n\nDreams of endlessly cyclical bull runs are dampened by dreary economic factors. Increased rates to curb inflation mixed with slowed spending and ongoing war in Europe uniquely overshadow our current bear market.\n\nBull run returns are getting smaller every cycle | Chart by David Canellis\n\nTo Vivek Raman, head of proof-of-stake at research unit BitOoda, this bear market\u2019s first punch was a resulting paradigm shift in macro markets, to which previous cycles didn\u2019t have to contend.\n\nMarkets transitioned from an era of easy monetary policy since the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 low rates and high liquidity \u2014 to one of higher rates, rising cost of capital and stricter monetary discipline, Raman said.\n\n\u201cAs a result, assets that thrived in the former environment were high growth and not necessarily high cash flow \u2013 we saw tech companies soar, valuations from [venture capitalists] soar, and this permeated into a lot of crypto assets performing very well without underlying fundamental value.\u201d\n\nThose perks are long gone, thanks to the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate hikes. Raman reasoned the Fed is likely to slow or pause additional increases to renormalize the economy by tamping down soaring inflation. But there have been \u201cthriving bull markets in eras of higher rates,\u201d according to Raman, including periods of the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nLex Sokolin, chief cryptoeconomics officer at ConsenSys, told Blockworks that investors are largely risk-averse and waiting for a recession. That makes relying on consumer discretionary spending or stimulus-led savings to bail out crypto prices difficult, he said.\n\n\u201cInstead, we will need to see organic growth from Web3 and real economic activity,\u201d Sokolin said. \u201cOne of the most relevant metrics would be smart contract usage, which is the core value proposition of Web3 \u2014 automated economic protocols.\u201d\n\n450 days to go until Bitcoin halves\n\nOne cycle theory posits that bitcoin bears and bulls are tied to its halving schedule. Every four years, block mining rewards are reduced by 50% \u2014 slashing issuance as bitcoin approaches its 21 million supply limit.\n\nEvery single halving has occurred during the early innings of a bull market leading up to a significant run one year later.\n\nThe one in 2016, when bitcoin was worth a few hundred dollars, preceded a major charge to $20,000 in late 2017. And when Bitcoin halved in 2020, the asset was worth around $9,000 \u2014 by Nov. 2021, it traded close to $70,000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving \u2014 a date difficult to pin down \u2014 is right now expected sometime in April of 2024. That gives Halving-Truthers at least half a year more of depressed market action before their pre-programmed bullishness triumphantly returns.\n\nAn end to the bitcoin bear market can\u2019t come soon enough for miners, whose livelihoods are inextricably linked to the protocol\u2019s halving schedule. Katie Talati, director of research at investment firm Arca, told Blockworks that capitulating miners wielded much larger influence over the price of bitcoin last cycle.\n\nSo, too, did Asian crypto markets, anchored in more than 70% of the bitcoin hash rate being housed in China at times. The West has been increasingly dominant in the bitcoin market ever since China\u2019s renewed crypto crackdown in 2021.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that factor into bitcoin\u2019s price,\u201d Talati said. \u201cThe halving definitely has an impact because it changes a lot of those factors, it changes the economics of the game and makes production more expensive.\u201d\n\nFourth time\u2019s the charm? | Chart by David Canellis\n\nTalati\u2019s take is that bitcoin is going to go back up at some point \u2014 along with Eberle and Raman. But Talati sees a future where something more tangible, such as demand for Ethereum block space, may one day determine overall crypto market sentiment, making ether crypto\u2019s bellwether digital asset over bitcoin.\n\nIn the meantime, all eyes are on what contagion might still remain from FTX, Eberle said.\n\nMore companies could well go bust before this bear market wraps, according to Raman \u2014 which could mean further downward pressure from ensuing asset liquidations.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part isn\u2019t determining whether we will have another bull market \u2013 all markets will be cyclical \u2013 but it\u2019s knowing when the bear cycle will end, since each bear market has different circumstances,\u201d Raman said.\n\nHe pointed to signs of a macro bottom: Fed pausing its rake hikes, normalized inflation and restarting moderate monetary stimulus.\n\nA crypto bottom: apathetic sentiment (worse than the current \u201cattack and anger\u201d phase, in which most people forget about crypto altogether) and renewed institutional capital (ETH staking withdrawals could do the trick), as well as new users and use cases, plus regulatory clarity.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget the 2024 halving, \u201csince BTC halvings tend to coincide with new bull markets.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "The Genesis Block: The First Bitcoin Block - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The Genesis Block was simply the first block of bitcoin (BTC) to be mined. You might see it called Block 0 or Block 1.\n\nIt\u2019s still there today and will remain there as long as any computer runs the Bitcoin software. Every node in the Bitcoin network can go and look at it, even though it now sits at the other end of a chain hundreds of thousands of blocks long. That\u2019s the point of the blockchain.\n\nA block is a collection of transactions that get validated all together. The transactions in a block get added at once to the chain, which is the complete history of legitimate transactions using bitcoin. Every blockchain has a genesis block, just as every regular chain has a final link. People care especially about the first Bitcoin block because Bitcoin was the first blockchain and remains the largest cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nThe number of transactions in a Bitcoin block is variable, but these days it\u2019s generally between 1,000 and 2,500. On the other hand, the time blocks take to get validated or \u201cmined\u201d is consistently around 10 minutes. This schedule is built into the software: If blocks are mined too quickly, the validation hurdle contrived to keep the network secure and ensure the mining process is competitive automatically gets harder, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the Genesis Block contains the first set of bitcoin transactions to be validated. In fact, there was only one transaction, which was the distribution of the 50 BTC reward for mining the block to a certain address. Miners are still rewarded today, though the reward has since declined to 6.25 BTC. In the case of the Genesis Block, there was only one person who knew about bitcoin to mine it: the original cryptocurrency\u2019s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSatoshi (almost certainly a pseudonym) mined the Genesis Block on Jan. 3, 2009. That was three months after he or she published the Bitcoin white paper in an online cryptography forum. People now call Jan. 3 \u201cGenesis Block Day.\u201d\n\nThe first Bitcoin block\n\nSatoshi made the Genesis Block special in a number of ways. For one thing, the 50 BTC reward was sent to an address from which it can never be recovered. On a technical level, the 50 BTC transaction wasn't recorded as such in the same way as later transactions. That\u2019s why any attempt to spend those coins would fail. Satoshi never commented on the reasons for that.\n\nIn a still more mysterious move, Satoshi wrote a message within the standard lines of data attached to the block. It was a headline from British newspaper The Times:\n\nThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\n\nAgain, Satoshi never explained this. But others have read heavily into the choice. One of Satoshi\u2019s aims in creating Bitcoin might have been to save people from having to hand money over to a bank as an alternative to stashing cash under their mattress. In 2009, the great recession was in full swing. Some people had gone to their bank only to find their money was gone. Other people found their pensions had gone the same way. Many think it is no coincidence that Satoshi chose that particular headline to write into the Genesis Block. This was supposed to be the beginning of the end of people relying on banks so much that the government had to rescue them from their own mistakes using taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nWhether Satoshi\u2019s comment was targeted mainly at banks or governments or both remains a topic of debate among Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nAnother theory is a little more mundane. The inclusion of a headline from that day proved that the code wasn't written before that day. Satoshi might just have wanted to dispel any suggestion he had mined the block in advance to give himself some advantage as its creator.\n\nSatoshi might have had all these things in mind. Barring a spectacular unmasking, we will never know for sure.\n\nIt is also peculiar that the second Bitcoin block was mined on Jan. 9, a whole six days after the first one. Remember, Bitcoin blocks are supposed to take 10 minutes to mine. There could be lots of reasons for the outlier block time. The algorithm that adjusts the difficulty of mining to maintain the 10 minutes only kicks in every two weeks or so. But the fun theory is that Satoshi was consciously echoing the six days that God takes to create the world in the Book of Genesis.\n\nHow are Bitcoin blocks different today?\n\nBitcoin blocks have changed a lot since 2009. They contain thousands of transactions, instead of one. They take 10 minutes to mine. Miners are rewarded with 6.25 BTC, after three \u201chalvings\u201d of the reward, which occur roughly every four years on a predetermined schedule. As of December 2022, there were more than 750,000 blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain. They form an unbroken sequence, each specifically referencing the previous one, stretching all the way back to the Genesis Block.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "What will Bitcoin become when it\u2019s all grown up? - Forkast News",
        "content": "This week, Bitcoin is celebrating its 14th birthday. As the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world eases into teenhood, it faces a future that, while seemingly tainted with uncertainty, is also brimming with endless possibilities.\n\nAfter all, it was the genesis of Bitcoin in 2009 that birthed the emerging technology of blockchain and marked the start of the decentralization revolution across the globe. With blockchain and cryptocurrency having cemented their place in the mainstream, and Bitcoin even likened to gold due to its utility as a store of value \u2014 its potential for growth is evident to all.\n\nBut much like every coming-of-age story, what lessons might the industry learn from its tumultuous journey thus far, and what can we look forward to in a new world that is discovering meaning and sense?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s birth: a story of hope\n\nAmid what was arguably one of the most devastating financial crises in history, public distrust of central governments and financial institutions grew to an all-time high following the colossal collapse of Wall Street behemoth Lehman Brothers in 2008 \u2014 but from the ashes rose Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of a person or group of individuals who brought forth Bitcoin, a trustless model for electronic cash transactions.\n\nNakamoto\u2019s white paper painted a rosy and hopeful picture of the future at a time when loss and distrust were rampant in the financial world. At the heart of it all, Bitcoin was created to solve long-standing issues that had plagued the financial system by offering anonymity and transparency in peer-to-peer payments \u2014 effectively eradicating the need to go through intermediary parties like banks that we had deemed to be \u201ctrustworthy\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d prior to the Wall Street fallout.\n\nIndeed, interest was piqued with Bitcoin\u2019s first financial use case \u2014 when hungry programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas from fast food chain Papa John\u2019s. But when more use cases beyond commercial transactions emerged, the world sat up and listened. Bitcoin did not just promise a better future \u2014 it delivered \u2014 when crypto began to solve wider socioeconomic issues across the globe.\n\nConsider the oft-quoted example of people in the Philippines pivoting to crypto game Axie Infinity as a source of income when the Covid-19 pandemic hit \u2014 despite teething problems such as the numerous controversies surrounding the game, its sheer ability to lift communities out of poverty is undeniably encouraging. Or look no further than the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Day Organization\u2019s efforts to empower women \u2014 who also form the majority of the world\u2019s unbanked population \u2014 financial inclusion could in fact become a reality for historically marginalized communities. It is apparent that crypto is blossoming into a legitimate asset class with the potential to radically reset the financial landscape.\n\nA teenager with growing pains\n\nAlas, adolescence is never an easy phase. Much like the mood swings and identity crises that any teenager experiences, Bitcoin has experienced wild market swings and has even had its very existence called into question. Beyond price volatility, many have cited its enormous energy consumption \u2014 at 91.4 Twh, the network can power all of Finland for an entire year \u2014 as the single biggest issue the legacy network has to solve. On the other hand, others have argued that its consensus mechanism allows for the realization of Nakamoto\u2019s vision for a decentralized, democratic financial ecosystem.\n\nAt the same time, even more challenges abound for the wider crypto space. Whether it\u2019s due to greed, hubris, or pure misfortune, what we had believed to be \u201cindustry heavyweights\u201d like Three Arrows Capital and FTX have single-handedly destroyed investor confidence and faith in crypto with their respective Lehman moments \u2014 ironically reminiscent of the financial crisis the asset class emerged from.\n\nWith bad actors threatening to spell the end for Bitcoin and the crypto industry, where do we go from here?\n\nThe path to maturity: boundaries beget safety and stability\n\nAs the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to develop and mature, but we need to rally together as a community to support the growth of the nascent industry on all fronts. We need constant innovation, we need visionaries in the space, but most of all, we need boundaries.\n\nWhen parameters are established by regulators and policymakers, innovators can develop and experiment with emerging technologies in a stable, sustainable manner and within safe confines. Without clear regulatory frameworks, innovation will only introduce risks to the ecosystem and eventually suffocate its own growth. Thankfully, we are making some headway to counter this possibility across Asia. Most recently, Hong Kong announced the framework of a new regulatory regime for digital assets to combat money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and Japan continues to adjust its crypto laws to suit dynamic market demands.\n\nDespite the loss of trust in the aftermath of the recent crypto crash, continued institutional buy-in also serves as a reminder that it was centralized entities that first failed \u2014 not crypto\u2019s underlying technology.\n\nAt the end of the day, the lessons we have learned from Bitcoin\u2019s short 14-year history will go on to shape the future of digital finance. For the long-term viability of crypto, it would be vital for measures that embed accountability, regulatory discipline and general responsibility to come into play, lest we forget Bitcoin\u2019s provenance and its altruistic promise to recreate the financial world to be one that is democratic, safe and inclusive."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's biggest and most popular cryptocurrency is celebrating its 14th birthday today. On January 3, 2009, the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis block, was mined by the pseudonymous developer(s) known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Cryptocurrencies are by-products of the blockchain technology.\n\n\"Despite challenges, Bitcoin has continued to thrive and has become an alternative to the centralised financial world. As Bitcoin turns 14 years old, it is worth reflecting on the incredible journey that it has been on thus far and the many innovations that it has inspired. Here's to hoping that the next 14 years are just as exciting for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency world,\" said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX.\n\nCryptocurrencies had a harsh 2022 after reaching record highs late last year, buffeted by everything from the Fed\u2019s policy tightening to the implosions of the Terra/Luna ecosystem, hedge funds Three Arrows Capital and exchange FTX.\n\n\u201cBitcoin turns 14 years old today. Being the front runner in this fast-maturing asset class, Bitcoin had a roller coaster ride. From being exchanged for a couple of pizzas to giving people ambitious hopes of buying Lamborghinis with their holdings to more rational adoptions, such as investment products by financial institutions, Bitcoin has come a long way. We are witnessing a modern financial revolution led by Bitcoin. With nations drafting legal frameworks around the usage of cryptocurrencies, the coming times are going to be milestone moments for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency ecosystem,\" said CEO and Co-founder, Edul Patel, Mudrex.\n\nBitcoin, which is currently trading over $16,500 level, is down by three-quarters from its record high of $69,000 that it had hit in November 2021.\n\n\u201cWe will see a lot of regulations in 2023 and the years to come and the markets will mature and become stable. All these moves will penetrate Bitcoin more and more in the global economies. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin will prove it to be the most trusted on the in the future as compared to other crypto currencies which are very much centralized,\" said Amanjot Malhotra, Country Head - India, Bitay.\n\n\u201cLooking at the historical growth of Bitcoin, we find that it has thrived victoriously through multiple bull and bear market cycles. According to data from Glassnodes, close to 60% of circulating Bitcoin hasn't moved in a year. This shows that the trust in the asset remains rock solid. We are confident that Bitcoin will continue to emerge victorious and see greater heights in future,\" said Raj Karkara, COO, ZebPay.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "Why Bitcoiners don't want to be lumped in with other cryptocurrency enthusiasts - Texas Standard",
        "content": "The downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX cryptocurrency exchange has brought a lot of focus to the inner workings of the crypto marketplace, even among folks who hadn\u2019t previously paid much attention to this world.\n\nThe FTX crash also exposed rifts among crypto enthusiasts, some of whom say that Bitcoin \u2013 the cryptocurrency that started it all \u2013 should not be viewed in the same light as FTX, or linked to what they believe to be less stable currencies.\n\nSlate associate writer Nitish Pahwa wrote about the divide between Bitcoin and other parts of the crypto world. He told Texas Standard that Bitcoin \u201cmaxis\u201d or maximalists, believe other cryptocurrencies are too closely connected to the traditional finance system Bitcoin was instituted to avoid. Listen to the story above or read the transcript below.\n\nThis transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:\n\nTexas Standard: What did you see as the significance of the FTC\u2019s failure for the crypto industry overall? I mean, if you had to put your finger on what the significance was, what would you say?\n\nNitish Pahwa: I think there are several planes of significance, but to really harp on the biggest ones, I think one \u2013 it was just a huge shock to a lot of people over the past couple of years who finally got interested in cryptocurrency because Sam Bankman-Fried, the man at the center of it all, had presented himself as this very ethical, very smart, very savvy operator who was doing a lot of fundraising through cryptocurrency for the greater good of the world. And then it turns out he may have been just doing a lot of the same fraud as anybody in the traditional financial system. We obviously don\u2019t know yet. The criminal charges and civil charges are ongoing, but it is definitely plausible.\n\nAnd as for other parts of the crypto world, especially the Bitcoiners, the ones who have been sticking firm to Bitcoin from the very beginning \u2013 they view this as a vindication of their principles, because they never wanted to see their technology or the very concept of their Blockchain-based digital currencies reach a level that it had with Sam Bankman-Fried. They wanted it to be its own thing. So when they see this particular flame out, they\u2019re looking at this like, \u201cokay, this is why we were right all along.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, the term \u201cBitcoin\u201d sometimes gets used sort of generically like \u201ccrypto,\u201d but \u201cBitcoin\u201d actually refers to a specific currency that started in 2008. What, then, was happening with FTX and can Bitcoin be sort of walled off from FTX\u2019s failure?\n\nYeah, Bitcoin really kicks off 2008-2009 after the financial crisis. It\u2019s envisioned as a peer-to-peer currency with a certain amount of coins in existence, a certain amount of blocks from which to mine those coins, and done in a way where a lot of people are cut in at all times running their own systems for mining and working together in Bitcoin trades. Now crypto, on the other hand, has become this umbrella term for everything else that Bitcoin has basically led to or inspired. And so that means any other big digital currencies that are not named \u201cBitcoin,\u201d or any of these big exchanges or companies like FTX that are now very much enmeshed within the traditional financial system. They\u2019re publicly traded on the stock market and they\u2019re gaining typical venture capital investment and such.\n\nBut Bitcoiners always want to stay outside the traditional financial system \u2013 or as they call it, \u201cTradFi\u201d \u2013 because they viewed TradFi as being responsible for disasters like the financial crisis or myriad other economic crises before them. So they don\u2019t want Bitcoin to get caught up in the way that it has through exchanges like FTX. But then of course it is businesses like FTX through their aggressive publicity marketing, partnering with celebrities like Tom Brady and so on, that ended up getting more attention to this world.\n\nWell, now, of course, Bitcoin has not emerged from this unscathed, even though I hear what you\u2019re saying and I understand what the community is doing when they\u2019re drawing the distinctions. But Bitcoin was already way down in 2022. What sort of headwinds do they face now with confidence among the population at large sort of being hammered and shattered?\n\nSo you\u2019re absolutely correct that Bitcoin has been affected a lot by economic travails from the hike in interest rates, general stock market crashes, tech layoffs, you name it. A lot of people do trade or store Bitcoin on these exchanges, which, to really generalize and oversimplify it a bit, do kind of operate like banks. You store some currency in there. It\u2019s supposed to be backed by collateral. They\u2019re doing some other lending. And in return for your investment, you\u2019re supposed to get a pretty decent yield percentage. Now, for all this, there are a lot of people who held Bitcoin and did not want to just stick to the traditional system. They wanted to try to see what they could do with Bitcoin on all these other exchanges. And so when these exchanges have been hit, Bitcoin\u2019s value falls as well. And right now, Bitcoin is definitely not doing well.\n\nThat being said, a lot of \u2018maxis\u2019 \u2013 the term for Bitcoin maximalists \u2013 will tell you that this is not as bad a crash that they\u2019ve seen before. There\u2019ve been plenty of Bitcoin crashes over the years and their mantras are always, \u201chold on for dear life, buy the dip because eventually it\u2019ll still pan out.\u201d I do not foresee the currency regaining a ton of its value anytime soon, but I also don\u2019t see it totally going away because its hardest adherents are going to keep their faith in it.\n\nWell, I also wonder how much FTX has turned the spotlight on Bitcoin and the possibility of government regulation.\n\nOh, absolutely. There is going to be some regulation for sure. The White House is weighing in, Congress is weighing in from both sides of the aisle. There definitely has to be something that comes out of this, because with Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s downfall, now, there\u2019s a lot of scrutiny on lawmakers who got donations from him. And they\u2019re going to be very eager to prove that they were not just like stooges on his behalf. And this could be anything with regard to fraud control or just designating whether like a certain digital currency is a commodity or a security or some other sort of financial instrument. But I\u2019m like 99% positive that there will be some sort of government action on cryptocurrency in the new year.\n\nIs Bitcoin now liberated to move forward independent of FTX or not so much?\n\nOh, that\u2019s a great question. Yeah. I think there\u2019s definitely going to be a chill and I think a lot of the Bitcoin maximalists are going to take the opportunity to really push for their way of things. How convincing that is going to be, I have no way of knowing. That being said, I do think crypto\u2019s and Bitcoin\u2019s reputation as a whole is definitely shattered, at least for a little bit, and we\u2019ll see what it actually takes for them to recover in any conceivable way."

Why this incredible lack of volatility? This is true, but I'm just looking at the graph. You know, the big graph. Abigail, your correspondent, was showing just before the break, it was it was really fascinating when you look at it on that big scale like that, because you see what we've been pointing out for years and years, which is that you get these big trends with crept up and down and up and down these big waves that last for a few years and then back down and then another one and another one. And you know, we can't go on forever and ever. Right. We're not gonna be sitting here in hundreds of years time with with the same kind of pattern of waves. But it has held firm really well so far and is reflected in a really interesting report I read from the man group just before Christmas, which showed that a trend following strategy performed on Bitcoin and a theorem has outperformed buy and hold. It's been extremely effective. Really? That's what I've been doing for years and years. I buy as each new trend begins. And then once there's all the froth. And you always know when you're at the frothy time because everybody is going crazy about crypto. And that's the time I always start to think about selling. And, you know, so far that has worked several times in a row, as I say. You can't be sure that it will continue to work forever. But so far, always the waves. OK. So once we get out of this period of status, is it more likely we get a break to the up or downside, in your view? Glenn? Well, look, we can't definitively say that we've had the very last bit of downward movement, certainly loads of old chain data and and the various indicators that we use to try and see where we are in a cycle are telling us that we are pretty much at the bottom. But I know from past experience that even when the indicators tell you you're at the bottom, you might get one more lurch downwards. I mean, we've got a huge lurch downwards. You might remember, in 2020, just before the bull market began, because the pandemic caused everybody to panic and everybody rushed out of stocks and crypto. But then they rushed back into crypto in the big, big bull market began. So, yeah, as I say, you can't rule out another lurch downwards. But as I say, as a trend follower, I tend to wait until I see, you know, really clear signs that we're back at the beginning of an upward trend. For example, my personal account, I didn't really start buying until we got to about ten thousand dollars. And in 2020, the price had previously gone as low as I think about what was it, three or four thousand dollars? So I waited quite a while. I missed quite a lot of upside, but gotten with plenty more upside to go, of course. Glenn, what do you refer to? They they were rushing out and then rushing back into crypto. Who realistically are we talking about or are we talking about retail or are we talking about institutions? Is there still institutional buy in after all of the turmoil we have seen? There's no love of institutional buying right now, but I can pretty much guarantee that there will be again, simply because it's on their menu now. It's on their radar. And the report that I mentioned from Man Group here, of course, is huge asset manager was was very positive about the idea of crypto as an asset class. And the report even suggested actually that if you don't invest in crypto in the longer term, then you are in a sense exposed to it in a negative way. Because companies that you are exposed to might be pushed out of the market eventually by crypto will block chain based competitors. So, you know, that report was suggesting that that you kind of need to have exposure. I hope I'm not paraphrasing them too much, but that was what I took from it. Glenn, is it important to get regulation, you know, for for crypto or Bitcoin specifically because this crypto currency, it felt like was invented to circumvent that kind of centralized government control? Like, do we even want it? I want to see a lot more skepticism generally during the bull phase. I mean, we're never short of skepticism during the bad phases. But some people like the next guy that you've got coming on, Stephen Dale, who is kind of shouting about the negatives during the bull market. Nobody was listening to him then. They're all listening to him now, of course. But it's too late for that during the bull phases. We need people to look at things like Luna when you have 20 percent yields being offered on people's money. You know, I was looking at that at the time. People were asking me about it and I was thinking about something very suspicious. I don't know if there's a problem with the code, but 20 percent yield, you know, if it's in traditional finance, you would start asking serious questions. And the same needs to happen in crypto. People just shouldn't get too overexcited on the upside."

        "title": "Tax attorney breaks down the MicroStrategy Bitcoin sale - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy made headlines ahead of New Year\u2019s Eve as the sale of a portion of its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings drew the attention of industry experts and critics.\n\nA regulatory filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 28 detailed the first time the firm sold some of its BTC since its high-profile adoption of the preeminent cryptocurrency as its primary treasury asset.\n\nMicroStrategy made waves in the industry in 2021 as it began amassing significant holdings of BTC, with founder Michael Saylor touting the asset as a superior store of value to fiat currency as a primary reason for the move.\n\nGiven Saylor\u2019s role as a staunch Bitcoin proponent over the past two years, MicroStrategy\u2019s decision to sell some of its BTC drew attention across the industry. However, the company\u2019s SEC filing outlines clear intent to generate a tax benefit.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s subsidiary MacroStrategy bought 2,395 BTC for approximately $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21 at an average price of $17,871 per BTC. It then sold 704 Bitcoins on Dec. 22 at an average price of $16,776 per Bitcoin for $11.8 million, highlighting its intent to reduce its tax bill:\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph reached out to international tax attorney and CPA Selva Ozelli to unpack MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin sale and the reasoning behind it. As she explains, selling cryptocurrencies for a profit in America would require the payment of capital gains tax:\n\n\u201cSome investors choose to reduce their capital gains in a given tax year by selling some of their digital assets at a loss. This is called tax-loss harvesting.\u201d\n\nOzelli said that the practice is common for individuals in the cryptocurrency space, given that assets like BTC are treated as property by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and subject to capital gains and losses rules:\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the wash sale rule, which prohibits selling securities at a loss and reacquiring them within 30 days does not apply. Because crypto is not a security, there is no crypto-specific wash sale rule.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy made use of this exception, reacquiring 810 BTC for approximately $13.6 million in cash just two days after realizing a loss on the sale of a portion of its holdings.\n\nOzelli highlighted the volatility of cryptocurrency market prices as an opportunity for retail and institutional investors to realize and harvest capital losses. The challenge lies in identifying assets that present the greatest opportunity for tax savings:\n\n\u201cThe difficult part for investors is identifying which of the digital assets in their portfolio have the highest cost basis (original purchase price) when compared to the current market price.\u201d\n\nNonfungible tokens (NFTs) also present another avenue to reduce tax liabilities. Renowned DJ Steve Aoki has been selling a variety of NFTs on OpenSea, with his activity publicly viewable on his verified profile.\n\nReports speculate that Aoki may have been looking to carry out tax-loss harvesting. Cointelegraph has reached out to the DJ\u2019s publicist to ascertain the reason for the sale of hundreds of NFTs from his extensive collection."

        "title": "Key bitcoin developer calls on FBI to recover $3.6M in digital coin - Ars Technica",
        "content": "One of the prominent developers behind the bitcoin blockchain said he has asked the FBI to assist him in recovering $3.6 million worth of the digital coin that was stolen from his storage wallets on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nLuke Dashjr is a developer of the Bitcoin Core, an app that runs 97 percent of the nodes making up the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Core derives from the software developed by the anonymous bitcoin inventor who uses the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. That software was called simply Bitcoin but was later changed to Bitcoin Core to distinguish it from the coin. Dashjr has been contributing to the Bitcoin Core since 2011 and has long championed the concept of decentralization that the cryptocurrency was founded on.\n\n\u201cWhat the heck, FBI?\u201d\n\nOn New Year's Day, Dashjr took to Twitter to report that his entire bitcoin holdings\u2014worth roughly $3.6 million\u2014were \u201cbasically all gone.\u201d He said the hack stemmed from the compromise of a PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key that he used to ensure that his downloads of Bitcoin Core and a smaller app known as Bitcoin Knots weren\u2019t laced with malware. He said all his computers were compromised and urged people to hold off downloading new versions for the time being.\n\n\u201cSo to be clear: DO NOT DOWNLOAD BITCOIN KNOTS AND TRUST IT UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you already did in the last few months, consider shutting that system down for now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDashjr didn\u2019t respond to an interview request.\n\nIn the same thread, the developer said he had contacted the FBI and police but hadn\u2019t received a response.\n\n\u201cWhat the heck @FBI @ic3. Why can't I reach anyone???\u201d he wrote. \u201cI paid those taxes and the police don't care. What a scam.\u201d\n\nDashjr said the wallets compromised were both hot\u2014meaning accessible over the Internet\u2014and what he believed were cold\u2014meaning they were hosted on a device not connected to the Internet. He didn\u2019t elaborate, but it appears he was theorizing that one or more computers he used was infected and that the hackers could then obtain the funds stored on them. It\u2019s hard to make sense of that, however, since a wallet stored on an Internet-connected device is, by definition, hot.\n\nThat problem aside, the theory might be consistent with a breach Dashjr reported in November. During that incident, the developer said, the hackers \u201cbypassed my software-side security measures by rebooting the server off an unknown storage device. For about 5 minutes it was running some other system.\u201d The hackers then installed two or three remote-shell backdoors.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot that doesn\u2019t add up to the events Dashjr has reported. Without more details, it\u2019s hard to come to any firm conclusions. One takeaway, however, is clear, as evidenced by one of the most influential bitcoin developers calling on law enforcement to recover his stolen digital coin: The notion that cryptocurrencies provide a decentralized platform that cuts out established authorities is nothing short of a pipe dream."

        "content": "Last year was a difficult time for crypto investors, with billions being wiped out of the cryptocurrency market and the collapse of major exchange FTX dampening sentiment toward digital assets.\n\nThe fallout saw people losing their life savings overnight, with more than a million people and businesses reportedly owed money by FTX.\n\nIn light of the events of 2022, major financial regulators in the U.S. have come together for the first time to warn banks about the risks involved with being tied to the unpredictable crypto industry.\n\nIn a joint statement on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency sounded the alarm over the risks crypto assets posed to banking organizations.\n\n\u201cThe events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector,\u201d the agencies said. \u201cThese events highlight a number of key risks associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants that banking organizations should be aware of.\u201d\n\nLast year, cryptocurrencies across the board suffered a widespread selloff that became known as the Crypto Winter, with more than $200 billion wiped off of the market in a single day back in June. Some experts have predicted the phenomenon could last through 2023 and possibly into 2024.\n\nThe selloff, exacerbated by the implosion of major crypto exchange FTX in November, led to speculation over whether the world is witnessing \u201cthe end of crypto,\u201d with some heralding FTX\u2019s collapse as the cryptocurrency market\u2019s \u201cLehman moment.\u201d\n\nAs well as warning lenders about the \u201csignificant volatility\u201d of crypto markets, U.S. regulators urged financial institutions on Wednesday to be wary of the risk of fraud and scams within the crypto sector, as well as legal uncertainties relating to ownership rights and a lack of robust risk management and governance practices at cryptocurrency firms.\n\nAlso among the regulators\u2019 lengthy list of risk factors surrounding the crypto sector was a warning of a \u201ccontagion risk\u201d resulting from issues like opaque lending, investing, funding, service, and operational arrangements.\n\nThey added that there were heightened risks associated with decentralized networks, which included vulnerabilities related to cyberattacks, outages, lost or trapped assets, and illicit finance.\n\n\u201cIt is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,\u201d regulators cautioned.\n\nWhile they noted that banks in the U.S. are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing services to customers operating in the crypto sector, issuing or holding crypto-assets was \u201chighly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\u201d\n\n\u201cBanking organizations should ensure that crypto-asset-related activities can be performed in a safe and sound manner, are legally permissible, and comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those designed to protect consumers (such as fair lending laws and prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices),\u201d officials said.\n\n\u201c[Banks] should ensure appropriate risk management, including board oversight, policies, procedures, risk assessments, controls, gates and guardrails, and monitoring, to effectively identify and manage risks.\u201d\n\nWhat do banks think of crypto?\n\nWall Street banks are divided on the merit of cryptocurrencies, particularly in the wake of a turbulent 2022.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a renowned crypto skeptic, has likened investing in cryptocurrencies to buying useless \u201cpet rocks.\u201d\n\nHowever, JPMorgan\u2014like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs\u2014has a dedicated group for focusing on cryptocurrency.\n\nDeutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America have invested in crypto staffing divisions in recent years, according to CNBC, while Standard Chartered, UBS, and BNY Mellon had invested millions in crypto assets by 2021, Business Insider reported.\n\nOthers have taken a far more wary approach.\n\nHSBC, for example, said in 2021 that it would refuse to process cryptocurrency payments in Britain.\n\nWhile many lenders have jumped on the crypto bandwagon in recent years, many have warned that investors in the market could still be in for further pain.\n\nIn a research note at the end of last year, Standard Chartered\u2019s global head of research, Eric Robertsen, warned that investors could be caught off guard by a \u201csurprise\u201d Bitcoin plunge that would send the digital asset a further 70% lower in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan\u2019s analysts believe that its bottom is still yet to be reached, with the bank predicting in November that it will drop to around $13,000 while the crypto market suffers a \u201ccascade of margin calls.\u201d"

        "content": "We\u2019re going to dive into a long-term crypto play using a LEAPS options trade in just a moment, but first, tell me if you\u2019ve heard this scenario before. Crypto prices are at all-time highs, having generated triple- or quadruple-digit returns for traders and investors. Online message boards proclaim that it\u2019s \u201cup only\u201d season and new millionaires are being minted seemingly every day.\n\nThen, the unthinkable: prices collapse, exchanges fail, crypto \u201cblue chips\u201d lose 60%, 70%, 80% of their value.\n\nYou\u2019d likely assume that the story I\u2019m writing is the story of the 2022 market, replete with Ponzi tokens, SBF\u2019s incestuous self-dealing, and a crypto bloodbath that dragged the price of Bitcoin (BTC) down 74% in a year.\n\n[text_ad]\n\nHowever, I\u2019m also writing the story of the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange in 2014, which saw BTC lose 85% of its value, falling from just over 1,100 to a low of 178 in January of 2015.\n\nI\u2019m also writing the story of the crypto winter of 2018, which saw Bitcoin prices collapse 84% in a year.\n\nThis is all just a way to say that we\u2019ve seen this before. History doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\n\nSo, you may be wondering, what happened to Bitcoin prices next?\n\nWell, in the calendar year following the 2015 bottom, Bitcoin was up 143%. After two years, it was still up 117% from the bottom.\n\nA year from the 2018 low saw prices 136% higher. After two years, BTC was up 650%.\n\nNow, a lot of the criticism leveled at crypto and DeFi (decentralized finance) proved true last year. Scams and fraud were rampant. Much of the technology simply tried to financialize software that didn\u2019t need financializing.\n\nBut the best use case that exists right now, uncensorable money, remains a valuable tool. There are documented instances of women in Afghanistan using crypto to store money while fleeing the Taliban.\n\nConsider this hypothetical as a counterpoint to a competing offering that\u2019s been floated by central banks globally: a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Issued by central banks but recorded in a digital blockchain. This is currently being explored for cross-border settlement and not individual use, but a White House policy framework has already documented the government\u2019s interest in using a CBDC to promote equitable financial market participation and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine they start offering a tax discount to incentivize the adoption of the digital currency, say, a federally funded 1% sales tax discount on any transaction using CBDC. Easy enough to track on the blockchain, so the federal government could repay states for lost sales tax.\n\nThis hypothetical leaves aside the legal/legislative/policy considerations but is a useful thought exercise.\n\nNext, imagine that the political party that you disagree with the most takes power. Now, we have widespread adoption of CBDC and people we don\u2019t agree with in power. So, since it\u2019s tough to pass legislation banning whatever it is that appeals to the base\u2014abortion, red meat, GMO foods, whatever (your ideology doesn\u2019t matter)\u2014they simply turn off your ability to spend your CBDC on whatever it is they oppose. Essentially holding political opposition hostage by their purse strings. Democrats in control? Can\u2019t donate your CBDC to the RNC or spend it on factory-farmed foods. Republicans in control? Can\u2019t donate your CBDC to the DNC or Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis is not a policy judgment, just a case for the rumors of crypto\u2019s death being greatly exaggerated.\n\nA LEAPS Options Trade in Bitcoin\n\nIf you\u2019re not a crypto devotee but are interested in speculating on a recovery in the price of Bitcoin, there are attractively priced LEAPS going out as far as January 17, 2025, in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). The 10 and 12 strikes each have four-digit open interest, which helps keep the bid/ask spread reasonable, and last traded at $4.33 and $3.65, respectively.\n\nMore sophisticated investors who are willing to deal with higher volatility and lower liquidity can also find value with deeper-in-the-money LEAPS, like the lower-volume 5 strike. The 5 strike last traded at $6.38; a buy of the 5 strike and a sale of the 10 strike would be a $2.05 bull call spread that would be worth $5 upon expiration if BITO stays above 10.\n\nSystemic Risks to the LEAPS Options Trade\n\nIf this were a simple equity trade it would look like a no-brainer, but a BITO LEAPS option isn\u2019t just a simple equity trade.\n\nThe fund invests in futures contracts to replicate the price performance of Bitcoin, rather than holding Bitcoin directly. The costs of those contracts are not prohibitively high, but in the event of a two-year sideways market for cryptocurrencies, contract costs alone would likely drag prices of the ETF lower.\n\nAlso, after the collapse of FTX and Alameda, there have been increasing calls for regulation and oversight. While the government can make holding Bitcoin illegal (it happened with gold), monitoring direct investment in self-custodied Bitcoin could prove too tall a task for the U.S. (just as it has with China). But it would be much more straightforward to simply shut down BITO and force liquidation, should the regulatory winds ever blow that way.\n\nAs you can see from the chart below, there\u2019s not much momentum behind BITO, and the fund is still below its 50-day moving average and well below the 200-day.\n\nHowever, longer-term investors with an appetite for risk could see strong returns if Bitcoin comes out of this bear market the way it has in the past.\n\nTo learn more about Cabot\u2019s favorite stocks this month, click here to download your free report.\n\n[author_ad]\n\n"

        "content": "According to a recent report by Hash Rate Index, publicly-listed Bitcoin (BTC) miners took on more than $4 billion worth of debt during the run-up to the crypto bull market. Mesmerized by rising prices, industry rushed hand over fist to purchase Bitcoin application-specific integrated circuits miners on easy credit.\n\nHowever, in today's context of Bitcoin price collapse, skyrocketing electricity prices, lower market prices for mining rigs, and record-level mining difficulty, 2022 became an extremely difficult year for sector players. That said, some are holding on better than others.\n\nTop 10 publicly-traded Bitcoin miners by liabilities | Source: Hashrate Index\n\nOn Jan 3, Bitfarms announced that the company sold 1,755 BTC during Dec. 2022 for total proceeds of $29.9 million. The firm then used this amount to pay down $16.5 million in its BTC-backed facility, along with $2.0 million in equipment-related indebtedness.\n\nBitfarms also managed to renegotiate miner purchasing agreements leading to extinguishing $45.4 million without penalty while establishing a $22.4 million credit for pre-paid pre-paid deposits to be applied against future purchase agreements. The company mined 5,167 BTC ($86.1 million at the time of publication) for all of 2022 and had an outstanding debt balance of $47.0 million at the year's end.\n\nThe same day, Stronghold Digital Mining announced that it reached an exchange agreement to convert $17.9 million of its debt into preferred stock bearing a face value of $23.1 million. The preferred stock would bear no interest nor dividends, and would, in turn, be convertible into common stock (with negligible par value) at a conversion price of $0.40 per share, which is near the stock's market value of $0.44 at the time of publication.\n\nOthers were not as fortunate. Cointelegraph previously reported on Dec 21 that Greenidge signed a $74 million debt restructuring agreement with creditor NYDIG. The deal, if executed, would provide credit relief at the cost of restructuring the company from an independent Bitcoin miner into a hosting site for NYDIG's Bitcoin mining rigs. Similarly, Core Scientific, one of the largest players in the sector, managed to secure a $37.4 million loan but nevertheless is undergoing bankruptcy.\n\nNot all Bitcoin miners embarked on credit-fueled expansion strategies. On Jan 3., Digihost announced that it increased BTC production by 60% year over year. The company said it has no debt other than a vendor-take-back mortgage on its Alabama facility in the amount of $934,500. Cointelegraph also previously reported on Dec 21 that German Bitcoin miner Northern Data said the company had no financial debt while expecting $204 million in revenue for 2022."

        "content": "Shorting is a strategy to bet against falling asset prices. In its original form, investors wanting to short a stock had to borrow that stock from a counterparty. In return, they had to pay interest to the counterparty. The investor then sold the borrowed stock on the open market in the hope of buying it back at a lower price at a later time. After buying the stock back, the investor returned them to the original owner. The profit was the difference between the stock\u2019s selling and buying price minus the interest rate paid for borrowing the stock.\n\nToday, shorting is often done with future contracts. Futures are contracts between two parties that agree to exchange an asset at a predefined price and at a specific date in the future. In crypto though, most futures contracts are so-called perpetual futures. Instead of agreeing to exchange an asset on a specific date, the two parties simply take the current asset price and agree to pay each other the difference. If the asset price increases, the party holding the long position gets paid the difference to the agreed-upon start price by the party being short. However, when the asset price falls, the process works in reverse and the long party has to pay the difference to the party holding the short position. In addition, perpetual futures don\u2019t have an expiration date but run until one party cancels the contract.\n\nThe payments are happening in real time (every second) and the future contract can be canceled by either party at any time. To ensure that each party is always solvent and able to carry out their payments no matter how strong and fast the market moves, both parties have to deposit collateral \u2014 the so-called margin. Should the market move against one party and diminish its collateral below a minimum threshold, the party will receive a margin call with the request to deposit more collateral. Should the party not be willing or able to deposit more collateral, the future position will be automatically closed. This ensures that both parties are able to fulfill their contractual obligations at all times and neither party falls into debt."

        "title": "After a year of collapses, cryptocurrency\u2019s future in the balance - Roll Call",
        "content": "Spectacular cryptocurrency failures in 2022 have raised the stakes for the industry amid questions about the enduring viability of a technology that advocates say has the potential to revolutionize finance.\n\nThe crypto market lost trillions in valuation last year, spurred by the crash of the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD in May and the failure of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges, in November. With a total global market cap once put at close to $3 trillion, the industry now has a value that CoinMarketCap, a site that tracks prices, puts closer to $800 billion.\n\nIn Congress, where the industry once had a vocal contingent of backers, the hostility is now louder, with calls to severely restrict cryptocurrencies or ban them entirely.\n\nDespite the setbacks, crypto is still a cultural phenomenon, Nicole Valentine, fintech director of the Center for Financial Markets at the Milken Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cI do think that there still will be dinner table conversations around crypto,\u201d Valentine said. \u201cFor one thing, people still have a fear of missing out. \u2026 We should be asking ourselves questions about how we\u2019re developing and building this industry. I don\u2019t see it dying, and I don\u2019t see it losing its cultural interest at this point.\u201d\n\nAccording to a December report from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the number of people who transferred funds into a crypto-related account tripled during the pandemic, rising from 3 percent of the population in 2020 to 13 percent in June 2022.\n\nCrypto companies and exchanges had failed in the past, either through hacking or theft, but the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin Terra last year led to widespread losses among firms that previously appeared sure-footed.\n\nMain Street investors, drawn to the promise of high rates of return, suddenly found their investments worthless. At the time of its collapse, Terra was the largest algorithmic stablecoin, a digital asset designed to always maintain a value of $1 through market incentives rather than through backing by cash or securities.\n\nTerra and its sister coin Luna lost billions of dollars within a few days. The failure of FTX was even more abrupt, following assurances of safety by the company and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Well-established firms had put their money in FTX.\n\nU.S. authorities say Bankman-Fried misappropriated billions in customer funds deposited with FTX and steered the money to personal uses, to make political contributions and to repay billions of dollars in loans owned by Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried, who resigned when FTX filed for bankruptcy, was indicted in December.\n\nTwo of Bankman-Fried\u2019s colleagues, former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Zixiao \u201cGary\u201d Wang, pleaded guilty to criminal charges on Dec. 21 and are cooperating in the investigation, according to the U.S attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams.\n\nCharges, including those from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, accuse Wang and Bankman-Fried of diverting customer assets to the affiliated Alameda Research, which Ellison used for improper trading activity. The customer funds also went toward \u201clavish real estate purchases and large political donations,\u201d the SEC said.\n\nBankman-Fried, who previously testified in front of lawmakers seeking what many call sweetheart regulatory treatment, is free on $250 million bail.\n\n\u2018Crypto money spigot\u2019\n\nIn a world based on facts, the failures of 2022 would have been the end of crypto, according to Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of Washington-based nonprofit Better Markets.\n\n\u201cThe only reason that 2022 wasn\u2019t the end of crypto is because of the access and influence crypto has bought on a bipartisan basis,\u201d Kelleher said in an interview.\n\nBankman-Fried and other employees contributed $71.5 million to campaigns and political action committees in the midterm cycle, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Individuals associated with FTX companies donated at least $44.2 million to Democratic candidates and affiliated political action committees and at least $23.7 million to Republican candidates and PACs.\n\nThe Justice Department says at least some of that activity was improper, charging Bankman-Fried with violating campaign finance laws, though the indictment against him lacks specifics.\n\nBloomberg News reported Dec. 29 that Bankman-Fried met with senior White House officials at least four times in 2022.\n\nCrypto lobbyists, too, have increased spending on Capitol Hill. Lobbying spending attributable to the crypto sector quadrupled from $2.2 million in 2018 to $9 million in 2021, according to a March report from consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.\n\nKelleher said lobbying in Washington is picking up in the face of the crisis, citing crypto exchange Binance\u2019s move on Dec. 20 to increase its engagement with policymakers by joining the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a crypto trade association.\n\nBinance said in a post on its website that it will participate in \u201cresearch, roundtables, working groups and discussions with policymakers and regulators to help bring sensible policies that benefit society and users.\u201d\n\nKelleher said that \u201conce the crypto money spigot shuts down completely, then you will start to see a very different view coming out of the power centers of Washington.\u201d\n\nThe industry\u2019s lobbying or efforts with trade groups have come a long way in the past several years and represent a maturation, said Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute.\n\nSchulp said it was a good sign that the sector is ferreting out its own bad actors and setting internal standards, regardless of where political contributions are being made. She also predicted that crypto will be less visible in pop culture than in 2022, a reference to celebrity endorsements last year by the likes of NFL quarterback Tom Brady and his ex-wife, model and businesswoman Gisele B\u00fcndchen, and comedian Larry David.\n\n\u201cI think that we will see less of the kind of dramatic entrance in pop culture that we saw over the past year,\u201d Schulp said.\n\nBrett Quick, head of government affairs at the Crypto Council for Innovation, said the industry is looking at the setbacks as a chance to regroup. She said Bankman-Fried\u2019s actions, if the charges are true, have been illegal for 100 years and have nothing to do with the technology of crypto.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if we had regulators with oversight into the markets and into the firms operating within them, then it would vastly mitigate the possibility of some of these bad actors being able to access consumers and investors,\u201d she said.\n\nMark Cuban, a prominent investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA franchise who has said he was an early adopter of crypto, said in an email that the technology is \u201cabout applications\u201d and will always be, a reference to smart contracts and other uses. Smart contracts are self-executing when certain conditions are met and are seen as a way to avoid the need for a central authority.\n\n\u201cNone of that has changed,\u201d Cuban said. Cuban was an early investor in FiscalNote, the parent company of CQ Roll Call.\n\nWhether that is enough to conserve any of the industry\u2019s momentum remains to be seen.\n\nThe Milken Institute\u2019s Valentine, who said she owns a fractional share of bitcoin for research and analysis purposes, was on a plane in November and said someone sitting next to her struck up a conversation about crypto.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m sitting on the sidelines and I\u2019m going to wait until I think it\u2019s safe to get in,\u2019\u201d Valentine said. \u201cFor investors that have a high-risk appetite, come on in. For those that are a little more risk-averse or they\u2019re not as risky, I would say, yeah, take your time and get to know the industry.\u201d\n\nCaitlin Reilly contributed to this report."

        "title": "Here's how Bitcoin promotes global financial inclusion, according to Prince Philip of Serbia - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The fundamental aspects of Bitcoin (BTC) continue to power global financial inclusion, financial privacy and autonomy in conflict-affected nations despite difficult macroeconomic and cryptocurrency market conditions over the past year.\n\nThese are the key takeaways of an in-depth interview with Prince Philip of Serbia and Yugoslavia conducted by Cointelegraph Brasil\u2019s Cassio Gusson as 2023 gets underway.\n\nPrince Philip Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 shared his thoughts on the sector as he joined Jan3 as its chief strategy officer. The Bitcoin technology company seeks to drive the adoption of the preeminent cryptocurrency and was founded by Bitcoin proponent Samson Mow in 2022.\n\nIn April 2022, Jan3 announced a partnership to help develop El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin City and has since opened up an office in the BTC-friendly nation, according to Prince Philip. The company also intends to provide guidance and services to other nations looking to adopt Bitcoin in some capacity.\n\nPrince Philip told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin remains important as the preeminent cryptocurrency, with its technological specifications allowing for the emergence of a fairer monetary system and individual sovereignty of wealth:\n\n\u201cBitcoin, specifically, has the potential to promote financial inclusion because of its decentralized nature, which makes it resistant to censorship and manipulation.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly important for individuals or communities without access to financial institutions or those residing in countries with unstable or corrupt governments and institutions.\n\nPrince Philip also highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s ability to \u201cbank the unbanked,\u201d given its low barrier to entry. Any person with a smartphone can download a Bitcoin wallet and gain access to \u201cbasic banking services,\u201d which has become extremely relevant in emerging economies:\n\n\u201cIssuing a checking account with a minimum balance, a checkbook, a debit card, is simply too expensive for low-income consumers in the developing world, and for the banks themselves.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Prince Philip highlighted that Bitcoin has no branches, correspondent banking relationships nor employees. Stablecoins are becoming equally useful in developing nations where people want to save in the U.S. dollar:\n\n\u201cBitcoin and stablecoins have the potential to provide much-needed financial inclusion to people in countries with limited or no access to traditional banking services.\u201d\n\nBoth options provide a secure, cost-effective means to send and receive payments, even in remote areas with limited infrastructure. The confines and regulations of traditional banking are also removed, giving people access to some sort of financial facility where traditional services are not accessible.\n\nConflict-affected nations are also prime candidates for Bitcoin adoption, according to Prince Philip. Bitcoin facilitates cross-border transactions, offers financial privacy and autonomy, and promotes economic development:\n\n\u201cThis can be particularly useful in countries with authoritarian governments or a history of conflict, where individuals may be concerned about revealing their financial information or being subject to censorship or seizure of assets.\u201d\n\nEl Salvador has established itself as the banner carrier for sovereign Bitcoin adoption after becoming the first country to recognize BTC as legal tender in June 2021. While there are some teething problems remaining \u2014 as Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall outlined after a recent visit to the nation \u2014 El Salvador is a living example of what nation-led Bitcoin adoption looks like.\n\nPrince Philip believes that more countries should allocate a portion of their national treasury to Bitcoin, highlighting the established moniker of digital gold. There are tangible results being realized in the country as well, which Prince Philip describes as an example for other nations to follow:\n\n\u201cAlready we\u2019re starting to see the economic benefits of the Bitcoin policies, including accelerated GDP growth, tourism, new businesses being established and many other intangible markers.\u201d\n\nWhile Bitcoin is positioned as a driver of financial freedom, Prince Philip gave a cautionary comment on the development of central bank digital currencies. He cited caveats and limitations to nation-controlled CBDCs, which could be used to place restrictions or outright blocks on people\u2019s money."

        "content": "After a shocking year for Bitcoin (BTC), public miners will focus on strengthening balance sheets and minimizing costs this year, according to industry analysts.\n\nBitcoin mining cost minimization will likely lead public miners to either go private or merge with other companies in 2023, Hash Rate Index\u2019s Bitcoin analysts Jaran Mellerud and Colin Harper predicted.\n\nIn a blog post titled \u201c10 Bitcoin mining predictions for 2023,\u201d the analysts pointed out that public miners are burdened with strict reporting requirements, such as spending millions of dollars on annual reporting.\n\nAfter many Bitcoin mining stocks plummeted 90% in 2022, public miners could significantly reduce administrative costs by going private or merging with others to share the costs.\n\nAlongside predicting that 2023 will become the year of Bitcoin miners\u2019 merge, Hash Rate Index also forecasted a massive restructuring year in the Bitcoin mining industry. The analysts are confident that strengthening balance sheets will be a top priority for Bitcoin miners in 2023 as they fight to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nThe analysts noted that the unsustainable debt levels of some Bitcoin miners will force them to proceed with debt restructuring as the only option. Debt restructuring can imply negotiating lower interest rates or extending the due dates of the debt, the authors added.\n\nAccording to the analysts, Bitcoin miners will also increasingly hedge risks in 2023 by utilizing Bitcoin mining derivatives, including those allowing miners to sell their future hash rate for a specific hash price. \u201cWe will see a trend commencing of miners seeking to hedge everything that can be hedged, just like what is expected in more mature commodity-producing industries,\u201d Mellerud and Harper stated.\n\nAs for broader industry predictions, Hash Rate Index also predicted that the ongoing Bitcoin bear market will likely come to an end in 2023, referring to historical BTC price cycles. However, a full-scale bull market will not commence until traditional finance firms are ready to move into Bitcoin, which would take another one or two years, according to analysts.\n\nBitcoin hash rate growth is also likely to slow down in 2023, while mining equipment will become even cheaper, the analysts predicted.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners see mixed successes in tackling debt-fueled overexpansion crisis\n\nHash Rate Index\u2019s Bitcoin mining predictions come amid the crypto mining industry going through a major crisis fueled by Bitcoin losing about 60% of value in 2022. As many as 100% of public mining companies have been forced to sell almost all cryptocurrency that they mined in 2022 in order to survive the crypto winter."

        "content": "When cryptocurrency prices were on a tear during the COVID-19 pandemic, with prices peaking in November 2021, a Dallas businessman started looking for a way to benefit from the surge without accepting the high risk.\n\nWes Cummins started Applied Blockchain, now called Applied Digital, which rents out data center space to crypto miners and other players who need a lot of computing power. The company operates on long-term fixed-rate contracts to add more predictability to the business, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt takes some risk out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf our customers all go bankrupt, eventually there\u2019s a risk to us. But it takes the day-to-day price volatility out. And it takes the technology risk out if someone comes out with a new, really great miner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApplied\u2019s first active site in Jamestown, N.D., has created 33 full-time jobs with an average annual salary of $67,000 plus benefits, said Cummins, who sold Dallas-based investment adviser 272 Capital LP to B. Riley Financial Inc. in August 2021.\n\nBusiness Briefing Become a business insider with the latest news. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn the next few months, two more sites are expected to come online, including a 200-megawatt, 16-building site in Garden City that is fully contracted out by five customers and will also include a wind farm. The site, which has been delayed by the regulatory approval process in Texas, will need about 40 full-time employees.\n\nThe second upcoming site is a 180-megawatt facility in Ellendale, N.D., that has been contracted out to one large customer, Marathon Digital Holdings, a Las Vegas-based digital asset technology company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur expectation to be at near 500 megawatts of capacity by early 2023 is unchanged,\u201d Cummins said in a call with investors in October.\n\nThe company scouts for sites in locations with attractive power prices so it can rent out to customers for a lower cost, Cummins said.\n\nOnce these two sites are turned on in early 2023, the company expects to generate roughly $100 million in profit per year, which will equate to revenue in the $300 million to $350 million range, Cummins said. Applied Digital, which trades on the NASDAQ, reported a net loss of $4.5 million and revenue of about $7 million for the June to August period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApplied Digital is still seeing high demand for space in its facilities, but the customers have shifted a bit, Cummins said. Several of them are companies that provided loans to miners for buying equipment. Now that some of those miners can\u2019t make their payments, the lending companies have repossessed the equipment and are hosting it in an Applied Digital space, Cummins said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApplied Digital and other competitors benefited from China cracking down on crypto mining in mid-2021, which forced some miners to find space elsewhere. But the company changed its name from Applied Blockchain to Applied Digital in November to reflect its ability to host a broader range of customers than just crypto miners.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see strong demand from cryptocurrency customers, but we believe diversifying our customer base and revenue stream will be of long-term benefit to our shareholders,\u201d Cummins told investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom left, Applied Digital CEO Wes Cummins, executive vice president of operations Regina Ingel, executive vice president of finance Saidal Mohmand and chief financial officer David Rench. (Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)\n\nWith the crypto meltdown this year, Applied Digital found another way to profit off the industry by creating a fund to acquire distressed crypto assets like servers that are selling for 90% less than they were a year ago, he said. The fund will buy the distressed equipment to run in an Applied Digital hosting facility. The bitcoin that the machines mine will be returned to fund investors, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a way to let institutional investors like family offices come into a space in a way that looks familiar to them, by investing in a fund,\u201d he said.\n\nCummins said he\u2019s expecting a few more bankruptcies in the crypto space in 2023, as well as some consolidation. Right now, Applied Digital has no plans to add any more sites for bitcoin mining, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt has definitely been a struggle for the industry,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cI think if bitcoin goes up in 2023, which I think it will, the one prediction I\u2019m really confident on is that it won\u2019t be without a lot of volatility.\u201d"

        "content": "The bitcoin miner formerly known as Riot Blockchain has rebranded itself as Riot Platforms.\n\nRiot Platforms said in a Tuesday (Jan. 3) press release that the new name reflects the fact that it is diversifying its business while remaining driven by bitcoin.\n\nAlready active in bitcoin mining and data center hosting, the firm is continuing to expand and diversify its operations and aims to become a leading bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform, according to the press release.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant milestone for Riot and comes as a result of our unique strategic position in the market,\u201d Riot CEO Jason Les said in the release, adding that the company recently added to its bitcoin mining data center capacity by acquiring Whinstone U.S. and enhanced its electrical component engineering and supply chain capabilities by purchasing ESS Metron.\n\n\u201cThe scope and scale of our businesses continues to expand, and this rebranding better reflects our position as strategic allocators of capital to increasingly broaden the scope of our bitcoin-focused operations,\u201d Les said in the release.\n\nBloomberg reported Tuesday that the company had been a maker of diagnostic machinery for the biotech industry called Bioptix before changing its name to Riot Blockchain in 2017 and becoming one of the biggest bitcoin miners in the U.S.\n\nDuring 2022, as the price of bitcoin dropped and several companies in the crypto space went bankrupt, the value of Riot Blockchain\u2019s shares plunged 85%, according to the report.\n\nIn April, at a point where the firm\u2019s shares were down 35%, and several other publicly traded companies that focus on the crypto market were down as well, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that companies serving the market were suffering more during the downturn than the market\u2019s underlying commodity.\n\nAnalysts told the WSJ at the time that stocks of crypto-mining companies were down because they tend to be owned by individual investors who generally trade in and out of shares more than institutional investors.\n\nRiot said in its Tuesday press release that Riot and Whinstone U.S. will brand together under Riot Platforms, Riot\u2019s electrical equipment manufacturing business will continue to operate as ESS Metron and Riot\u2019s common stock will still be listed on Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticket symbol RIOT.\n\nIn addition, Riot will continue to seek opportunities to expand across its business lines, according to the release.\n\nFor all PYMNTS crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto Newsletter."

        "content": "The Ethereum network eclipsed Bitcoin in terms of total transaction volume last year, though the king of crypto has managed to retain its crown when it comes to online search interest.\n\nAccording to data from Nasdaq and Ycharts shared on Reddit on Jan. 2, there were 338% more Ether (ETH) transactions in 2022 (408.5 million) Bitcoin (BTC) ones (93.1 million).\n\nETH vs BTC transaction volumes - Nasdaq/Ycharts via Reddit\n\nThe values shown in the chart are in millions of transactions, with the average daily transactions at around 1.1 million for ETH and 255,000 for BTC.\n\nHowever, transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were steadier and more periodic than on Ethereum, which experienced much more volatility in transaction volumes. This was due to spikes in demand at certain times such as NFT launches and other gas-guzzling events such as XEN minting.\n\nEthereum\u2019s heftier transaction volumes have continued into the new year, with the Ethereum transaction count on Jan. 2 reaching 924,614, a 300% increase compared to Bitcoin\u2019s 229,191 on the same day, according to Bitinfocharts.\n\nETH vs BTC transaction volumes \u2014 Bitinfocharts\n\nThe analyst who posted the metrics said he was \u201cskeptical about people saying that a flippening could happen someday,\u201d adding that those advocating for it have reason to do so now.\n\nA flippening occurs when one chain surpasses a higher-ranked one for the same metric, in this case, transactions and activity.\n\nThe charts also do not include layer 2 transactions, which would put Ethereum even further ahead of Bitcoin for this metric. According to L2beat, the number of L2 transactions per second actually surpassed those on layer 1 Ethereum in mid-October and has remained above it ever since.\n\nRelated: Why the battle for low or no transaction fees really matters\n\nHowever, while Ethereum may be ahead in transaction and activity terms, Bitcoin remains the most-searched cryptocurrency online.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a newsletter from \u201cIn Bitcoin We Trust\u201d revealed that BTC attracted the most attention on the Google search engine in 2022, with 28.4 million monthly Google searches across the world.\n\nThe report concurred with Cointelegraph, which reported on Dec. 23 that Ethereum did not make second or even third place for search popularity. These spots were occupied by memecoins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) respectively.\n\nEthereum, in fourth place, had 3.8 million global monthly searches, according to the data."

        "content": "Let\u2019s face it \u2013 it\u2019s tough to be in crypto right now. While the broader market has been pummeled by challenges like inflation and rising rates, the crypto industry, already in a crypto winter, has suffered some high-profile scandals and setbacks. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a role for crypto in future portfolios, and crypto engineers are still finding ways to innovate \u2013 with one possible case for Bitcoin optimism found, surprisingly, in methane emissions.\n\nMethane, while less outright harmful than carbon dioxide, still is contributing to global climate change \u2013 but while it\u2019s burning, it could also be reused to mine Bitcoin, getting more bang for each fossil fuel buck. That\u2019s according to recent research from ARK Invest, which shows that as firms haven\u2019t sunk costs into flared systems en masse, vented methane could be used at well sites to mine Bitcoin.\n\nThe electricity generation required to mine Bitcoin via venting would also cost much less than it does currently for public Bitcoin mining companies, and when assuming no supply issues for hardware, Bitcoin miners could undercut \u201cpure play\u201d miners by using vented methane.\n\nThat could increase the return on investment for oil and gas fields and also unlock a new phase for Bitcoin mining writ large, supporting firms like Coinbase (COIN) which could see heightened traffic. Already down from crypto\u2019s struggles, ARK Invest has been buying the dip on COIN, with the stock weighted at 6.9% in the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) and 4.7% in the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).\n\nARKF charges 75 basis points and actively invests in firms poised to benefit from fintech advances in services like mobile payments, the blockchain, and customer platforms. ARKW meanwhile charges 88 basis points for its active investing, looking at companies set to benefit from advances in cloud computing, big data, AI, and more.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have taken a wallop lately, and that\u2019s true. That doesn\u2019t mean that the tide of innovation has stopped, with reusing vented methane one case for Bitcoin optimism to watch moving forward in ETFs like ARKF and ARKW.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Disruptive Technology Channel."

        "content": "The bitcoin network came into existence Jan. 3, 2009, spawning the cryptocurrency market industry.\n\nAmong other things, the peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash equivalent system promised to replace fiat, revolutionize commerce on the internet, and render redundant those financial institutions (FIs) serving as trusted third-party intermediaries by establishing cryptographic proof as the foundation of payment.\n\nFourteen years later, it is primarily those \u201cother things\u201d that have set off a sprawling, investor-centric crypto industry, on-chain Web3 offshoots like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as well as informed public and popular opinion of the digital asset class as primarily a volatile investment vehicle rather than a means of mass commerce.\n\nFiat, or non-commodity backed government issued legal tender, is still very much around. Fiat still drives commerce on the internet, and the role of FIs and central authorities with regard to payments has only grown more important as digital transformations sweep across industry landscapes and consumers increasingly use digital wallets to pay for goods and services.\n\nBut in achieving the primary monetary goal set out in its original white paper, a contemporary pulse check on bitcoin and its applications shows they have so far come up well short.\n\nThe Rise of a by-Product Industry\n\nEmbedded in that first minted on-chain block, the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0) was the text, \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nThe text has been interpreted by industry observers as a snide comment on instability caused by fractional-reserve banking. It references a day-of headline from The Times of London. As stated in its white paper, bitcoin was born of the failures of the 2008 financial crisis and intended to use technology to prevent those mistakes \u2014 and other issues seen as endemic to the traditional finance system \u2014 from happening again.\n\nInstead, some observers say, the crypto industry today operates a lot more like the fractional-reserve banking system than it does the traceless, trustless, technically secure architecture for global alternative transactions that was promised.\n\nIf bitcoin was supposed to be a reinvention of money, the cryptocurrency industry by-products it spawned have been embraced most by speculative investors.\n\nWhile some merchants and consumers flirt with crypto payments for everyday goods and monthly bills, it is the massive, centralized trading exchanges that have come to dominate the industry landscape, and define it through their successes and failures.\n\nElectronic Cash\n\nAs economist David Evans wrote for PYMNTS in the past, one of the benefits of physical cash is it doesn\u2019t require intermediaries. Cash also represents, for many purposes, an entirely anonymous way to transact.\n\nIn a pared downs sense, these were the primary qualities the yet-to-be-unmasked bitcoin founder, known only by the pseudonym \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto,\u201d hoped to replicate by creating an internet-based, decentralized public-ledger-grounded, alternative fiat.\n\nAs a cash equivalent meant for the digital landscape, bitcoin\u2019s early days were regrettably plagued by illicit use by holders of the assets who used the digital currency to purchase contraband on \u201cdark web\u201d marketplaces such as the infamous silk road.\n\nCryptocurrencies more broadly, beyond just bitcoin, continue to be a popular tool for global money laundering.\n\nMore legitimate, state-sanctioned efforts to leverage bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in developing nations are stalling or flat-out failing.\n\nInstead, dozens of governments and central banks around the world are currently exploring the feasibility of designing and launching their own digital currencies rather than relying on blockchain native cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlthough bitcoin was founded with the stated goal of transparency, anonymity and individual economic liberty from governmental oversight, critics argue the inverse appears to be happening, noting that state-based surveillance of citizens is more likely to increase in this arena while at the same time, individual privacy and financial liberty among digital currency users looks set to erode.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Next 14 Years\n\nHistorically, successful payments businesses have tended to have exponential growth in their early years, driven by a positive feedback loop that saw widescale adoption, trust and usage of their platforms. As the theory goes, as more merchants and consumers want to use a payment method, other merchants and consumers will accept and use it, leading to increased uptake.\n\nThis has not been the case for bitcoin, as the crypto industry has become centered on leveraged arbitrage, trading and given rise to its own cottage industry of investment vehicles and platforms, many of which have failed. At the same time, bitcoin as a payment alternative remains an ongoing, will-it-won\u2019t-it experiment while other crypto currencies, like litecoin, attempt to shoulder in and prove their own marketplace viability.\n\nTime is running out for bitcoin to realize its ambitious goal of one day replacing money itself, and belief in that premise appears to be dropping entirely in some corners of the financial industry as the asset matures.\n\nDepending on who you ask, bitcoin is either headed to $1,000,000 or set to suffer a further 70% reduction in value \u2014 a sentiment that seems to sum up bitcoin\u2019s prospect as a payment method. Few want the value of their currency to be based purely on what another person thinks it is worth.\n\nFor all PYMNTS crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily Crypto Newsletter."

        "content": "Even cryptocurrency\u2019s most accomplished tech wizards apparently aren\u2019t immune from the occasional wallet-draining hack. Luke Dashjr, one of the original core developers for Bitcoin, claims that someone swiped hundreds of BTC from his accounts late last year\u2014leaving him to start 2023 with nothing but an empty wallet and a heart full of woe.\n\nThe Biggest Crypto Heists of 2022\u2026So Far CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video The Biggest Crypto Heists of 2022\u2026So Far\n\nDashjr, who has worked for the Bitcoin Project for the past twelve years, took to Twitter on Sunday to lament the apparent hacking episode. While seemingly distraught, the dev didn\u2019t initially offer much explanation as to how any of this was supposed to have happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter allegedly thieving Dashjr\u2019s personal coin bounty, the hacker supposedly funneled the money to another crypto address, where the assets currently sit. The wallet shows a total of some 216.93 BTC, equivalent to some $3.6 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Dashjr, a cybercriminal managed to get ahold of his PGP key, which then led to a compromise of his hot wallet. PGP, which stands for \u201cPretty Good Privacy,\u201d is a popular security program designed to protect web users via encryption. PGP is typically used to encrypt certain kinds of sensitive information, though it isn\u2019t entirely clear in this instance how a compromise of Dashjr\u2019s key would have enabled the hacking episode.\n\n\n\nMany Twitter users responded to Dashjr\u2019s claims with sympathy, offering condolences for his stolen millions. However, more than a few people weren\u2019t so sure about the developer\u2019s claims. Most were just perplexed as to how something like this could actually happen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDo you a sense of what really happened? Can you share some insights that may help others?\u201d one user asked, to which Dashjr merely replied: \u201cNo idea.\u201d\n\nAnother user questioned why: \u201cHow [does] PGP key lead to losing Bitcoin?\u201d Dashjr responded: \u201cEverything is compromised.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother incredulous user posted: \u201cI don\u2019t buy this. You of all people should have at least some basic Opsec [operational security], and you are leading us to believe you kept over 200 BTC on a hot wallet?\u201d\n\nSome pointed out that tax season was fast approaching. At least one Twitter user accused Dashjr of perpetrating a \u201cboating accident.\u201d Boating accidents are tax avoidance schemes, in which a token holder claims to have lost their digital money to hackers but, in reality, maintains control of the funds and is merely trying to avoid the snooping eye of financial regulators. There is no evidence that this is what Dashjr is doing, though many details of what exactly happened to his money remain unclear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGizmodo reached out to the crypto developer for comment and will update this story if he responds.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if Dashjr would be the first crypto acolyte to get his coinage boosted. Last year showed that there was seemingly no end to the financial mayhem that could be wrought by cybercriminals who targeted the crypto industry. If this incident is any indication, it seems like 2023 won\u2019t be much different."

        "content": "The Australian city of Coolangatta has gotten its first Bitcoin ATM with integrated Lightning Network capabilities. The new ATM has been installed at The Strand shopping center in Coolangatta and is now available for use by the public.\n\nA Bitcoin Lightning ATM works quite similarly to traditional Bitcoin ATMs but saves significant time because of the instant transaction capabilities of the layer-2 Lightning solution. It also allows for purchasing very small amounts of Bitcoin (BTC), mostly in satoshis \u2014 the lowest denomination of Bitcoin, with 1 satoshi equal to 0.00000001 BTC.\n\nAt the moment, cryptocurrency ATMs settle transactions on the blockchain directly, but this has restrictions of its own. For instance, operators had to adapt to batching transactions when miner fees on the Bitcoin network considerably increased between 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn practice, this means that even though a user purchases BTC via an ATM, it is not immediately transmitted to them. Operators have processes in place that wait for other ATM network users to utilize the machines before grouping and sending out transactions for several users at once in one bulk transaction. This problem can be resolved to a significant extent with the help of the Lightning Network.\n\nUsing Lightning, the transaction becomes immediate because the operator doesn\u2019t need to batch the funds \u2014 as soon as cash is inserted, the user receives payment via the Lightning Network. While there is still a debate over whether the fees will be significantly reduced, they will likely be lower than an on-chain payment.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ATM installations record low in May, biggest drop since 2019\n\nThe recent installment of the Lightning-enabled Bitcoin ATM in Australia comes in the wake of the country overtaking El Salvador to become the fourth-largest Bitcoin ATM hub in the world. Australia had 216 ATMs stepping into 2023.\n\nAccording to Coin ATM Radar, the total number of crypto ATMs worldwide is currently 38,602, out of which 6,071 ATMs were installed in 2022 alone."

        "title": "Satoshi Nakamoto Mined the 1st Bitcoin Block 14 Years Ago - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "At press time, the market cap of the entire crypto-verse is $807.63 billion. This billion-dollar [formerly trillion-dollar] industry began with only one cryptocurrency, Bitcoin [BTC]. The asset set the stage for countless other cryptocurrencies to follow suit over time. However, Bitcoin has been the pinnacle of the digital asset revolution. But where did it all start?\n\nThe \u2018Genesis Block\u2019 opened doors to the very first set of Bitcoins. Satoshi Nakamoto formulated the genesis block exactly 14 years ago on January 3, 2009. On this day, the first batch of 50 BTC was mined into existence.\n\nWhat is the hype around Bitcoin\u2019s Genesis Block?\n\nApart from the fact that it was the origin of Bitcoin, a message from the creator of BTC, Satoshi Nakamoto is what makes this block stand out. Over 90 percent of BTC has already been mined and the blocks that followed suit came with no message. After mining the first set of Bitcoins, Nakamoto wrote in the code of the block,\n\n\u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what this line is all about, it was taken verbatim from the headline of a London Times article published on January 3, 2009. It reportedly described how the British government had bailed out banks.\n\nAlthough Nakamoto never explicitly stated what the message meant, many assumed that it was a reference to the reason behind the creation of Bitcoin. BTC was rolled out for a plethora of reasons. Financial freedom was one of the primary objectives. The above message is likely to show how Bitcoin bypassed middlemen and banks that Nakamoto believed to be dishonest and unreliable in favor of developing a more democratic form of money.\n\nIn addition to this, the above message has been the only form of communication from Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Nakamoto mined Bitcoins for several years following the creation of the Genesis Block. However, in 2011, Nakamoto disappeared and hasn\u2019t moved his stash of Bitcoins over the past 10 years.\n\nBlock 1 or Block 0?\n\nThe meaning of genesis by the Merriam-Webster dictionary is that it is \u201cthe origin or coming into being of something.\u201d Therefore, it is common to assume that the genesis block is Block 1 of the Bitcoin blockchain. However, it is actually Block 0.\n\nOwning to its block height, or how far it is from the very first block in the blockchain, the Bitcoin genesis block, which was once known as \u201cblock 1,\u201d is now typically called \u201cblock 0\u201d by existing users.\n\nBlock 1, the next block, wasn\u2019t mined until January 9, six days later. The average timestamp difference between blocks is ten minutes, therefore this is unusual.\n\nHowever, several explanations for the delay were put forth. Several speculated that Nakamoto spent a total of six days mining the first block to verify the stability of the Bitcoin system.\n\nHere\u2019s how Bitcoin\u2019s Genesis Block was mined\n\nSince nobody even knew it existed at the time, and it wasn\u2019t worth anything in any fiat currency, Nakamoto mined the first block on a CPU without any competition.\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin was more of an experiment than a currency or a store of value asset. These blocks were placed at difficulty 1, which is extremely low compared to the current bitcoin difficulty, therefore it would be quite simple for existing miners to solve them.\n\nAdditionally, it was only after a year that BTC garnered traction.\n\nWhat\u2019s the current status of Block 0?\n\n50 bitcoins that could not be utilized or were never spent were included in the Bitcoin Genesis Block. Certain individuals assume it was on purpose. However, a few others claim that this was a mistake that Nakamoto made.\n\nNevertheless, the rewards from the block were transferred to the address, 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. The address now has more than 66 BTC in it, of which 50 are still unspent."

        "content": "There is little agreement among Bitcoin\u2019s commentators over the last few weeks, with crypto execs, research analysts and billionaire investors offering wildly different takes on what's in store for Bitcoin for the year ahead.\n\nOne crypto exchange founder expects Bitcoin (BTC) to spike to $40,000 by the summer, while a Bitcoin billionaire has renewed his bullish $250,000 BTC price prediction for the year.\n\nErik Voorhees \u2014 $40,000 by the \u201csummer\u201d\n\nErik Voorhees, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, was optimistic about a potential recovery of Bitcoin\u2019s price during an interview with Bankless on Jan. 2, stating he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if Bitcoin (BTC) hit \u201clike $40K\u201d by the \u201csummer.\u201d\n\nVoorhees noted that if his prediction were to come true that would be \u201c2.5X\u201d from its current price of $16,666, which he said is a \u201cgreat return.\u201d\n\nThe crypto executive couldn\u2019t pinpoint the timing of the next bull run, only saying it would come sometime within the next \u201csix months to three years.\u201d\n\nHe shut down the idea that it could take as much as \u201c10 years,\u201d however, arguing that if that happened it would mean the whole \u201cthing [...] probably failed.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Voorhees said that the macro environment, interest rates and the tightening of monetary conditions are big factors in how the crypto market will play out this year.\n\nHe also acknowledged that the reputation of crypto from outsiders is \u201cjust trash\u201d but those commentators will also be the ones to be \u201cblindsided\u201d when the next rally happens.\n\nVoorhees said that whether we are in a bull or bear market, we are \u201cin the middle of a revolution right now.\u201d\n\nTim Draper \u2014 $250,000 by April 2024\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin billionaire investor Tim Draper has continued to knuckle down on his $250,000 Bitcoin prediction via his most recent Twitter post on Jan. 1, showing he even has it printed on a T-shirt.\n\nDraper first made the bold $250,000 Bitcoin price prediction during a speech at his own Draper University in San Mateo in April 2018.\n\nAt the time, he said he was looking into what he described as a \u201ccrystal ball,\u201d saying he was \u201cthinking\u201d of $250,000 for a Bitcoin by 2022.\n\nDraped said people would perceive those that believe in the prediction as \u201ccrazy,\u201d but reassured his audience it would happen and be \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\nIn his most recent tweet, Draper conceded that his \u201c$250K by 2022\u201d prediction was \u201coff by a bit\u201d but said he believes it \u201ccertainly\u201d will happen before the Bitcoin halving, which is set for April 2024 according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nHis bullish prediction was however met with varied comments on Twitter, with one user tweeting that they had \u201clost interest\u201d in the price of Bitcoin since Celsius stole the \u201cone Bitcoin\u201d they had, another tweeted \u201cyou have high hopes,\u201d while another predicted that it is \u201cunlikely\u201d to even go \u201cabove $30K in 2023.\u201d\n\nMike McGlone \u2014 $100,000 by 2025\n\nDraper\u2019s comments could be seen as particularly bullish even among Bitcoin supporters.\n\nIn September, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone \u2014 who has been optimistic about the future of Bitcoin in the past \u2014 tapped the crypto to only reach $100,000 by 2025.\n\nHe's made that prediction once before, during an interview in October 2020 where he said Bitcoin is \u201con track\u201d to hit \u201c$100,000 by 2025.\u201d A year later, he stood by that prediction in an interview with Kitco News, saying it\u2019s only a \u201cmatter of time\u201d to get to \u201c$100,000.\u201d\n\nHe saidthe reason for this is that supply is still \u201cgoing down,\u201d while adoption and demand are \u201cstill increasing.\u201d\n\nStandard Chartered \u2014 $5,000 in 2023\n\nIn December, United Kingdom-based banking firm Standard Chartered predicted Bitcoin could drop to as low as $5,000 in 2023 as one of the possible \"financial-market surprises\" of the year.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 5 report from CNBC, rising yields and a plunge in tech stocks could lead to an acceleration of a Bitcoin sell-off, causing further bankruptcies and collapses in crypto and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets.\n\nHowever, the author of the investor note, Eric Robertsen \u2014 the firm's global head of research \u2014 noted that this was an extreme prediction that fell outside its own baseline views and outside of market consensus.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Jack: \"I try to think more about when than where\" for price\n\nWhile some crypto industry figures have been confident enough to share their Bitcoin forecasts for the years ahead, others have been more reserved in sharing their thoughts on the subject.\n\nCo-founder and managing partner of digital asset management platform Nexo, Antoni Trenchev, recently explained to Cointelegraph that there are \u201cmany factors\u201d that can influence the price of Bitcoin.\n\nAlex McCurry, CEO and co-founder of blockchain solution provider Solidify.io, told Cointelegraph on Jan. 3 that \u201cBitcoin is a completely unpredictable asset.\u201d\n\nThe uthor of the best-selling book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, hasn't made any price predictions in recent months either, despite frequently posting about Bitcoin on his Twitter page.\n\nIn December, Kiyosaki said he was investing in Bitcoin and is \"very excited\" about it due to it being classified as a commodity much like gold, silver and oil, unlike other crypto tokens which he said have been classified as securities."

        "content": "Erik Voorhees \u2013 CEO of ShapeShaft and an outspoken proponent of bitcoin \u2013 believes it could take between six months and three years before the next crypto bull run occurs.\n\nHe also predicted that the primary cryptocurrency could surge to $40,000 by the summer, representing a 140% increase compared to current valuations.\n\n\u2018It Won\u2019t be Ten Years\u2019\n\nIn a recent interview for Bankless Shows, Voorhees argued that the reigning crypto winter will not last for another decade. However, if this is the case, then \u201cprobably the whole thing failed,\u201d he added.\n\nThe American thinks crypto could enter into a bull run as early as half a year since \u201cthat\u2019s generally how long it takes people\u2019s minds to start changing and speculative cycles to return.\u201d\n\nHe believes the volatility of the market in the near future will depend on multiple key factors, including the interest rates announced by the Federal Reserve, the macroeconomic environment, and the implementation of possible regulations.\n\nIf conditions improve, bitcoin could soar to $40,000 by the summer. Assuming his forecast comes true, this would result in 2.5X profit for investors who decide to enter the ecosystem now:\n\n\u201cIt also has a lot to do with the macro environment. As long as interest rates are held high and monetary conditions are tighter, it\u2019s going to be a headwind. That\u2019ll start changing in early to mid [2023]. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if bitcoin was at like $40,000 by the summer. That wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all. And that\u2019s like 2.5X from here. So it\u2019s a great return.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoorhees touched upon some severe catastrophes that shuttered the industry in 2022, such as the collapse of centralized organizations (with FTX, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, and Voyager Digital). He advised consumers to protect themselves by relying on self-custody methods:\n\n\u201cBut that lesson is really the one because if the majority of crypto funds and crypto wealth reside with intermediaries: A) we will never escape the regulation that this stuff is meant to escape, and B) we will never escape the need to trust humans.\u201d\n\nOther Predictions\n\nSome estimate that the prolonged bear market for bitcoin will end in 2024 when the next BTC halving will occur. One proponent of that thesis is Mark Yusko \u2013 CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management \u2013 who said:\n\n\u201cThen when we get to summer, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll get the next speculative move, and guess is that will come in anticipation of the next halving in 2024.\u201d\n\nHunter Horsley \u2013 CEO of Bitwise \u2013 believes the next bull run will happen this year, adding that price declines are a great opportunity for people to increase their exposure to the primary digital asset."

        "content": "In a recent piece titled \u201cCrypto will be fine,\u201d former CoinDesker Brady Dale noted that even though crypto has taken a beating throughout the year that was, there are some indicators that remain bullish. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate (how much computational power is directed towards securing the network) remains steadfast.\n\n\u201cIf the industry were dying, these miners should be winding down. They aren't,\u201d Dale wrote. Indeed, according to Blockchain.com data, Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate is just a ways off its all-time high set in November, 2022.\n\nThis article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hashrate rose steadily over the past 12 months even as the network\u2019s token, bitcoin, lost over two-thirds of its value. For many, this is a sign of faith in the long term success of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency network.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s more to the story than a single statistic. As Compass Mining\u2019s Zack Voell (another ex-CoinDesker) detailed in a Monday report, the bitcoin mining industry took a series of beatings in 2022.\n\nIn his catalog of \u201call of the bad things that miners suffered,\u201d Voell found that at least four executives of major mining firms resigned over the year, six lawsuits have been filed against mining companies \u2013 for reasons stretching from breach of contract to zoning rule violations \u2013 and stocks for publicly-traded mining companies are in the doldrums.\n\nAdditionally, two mining companies, Core Scientific and Compute North, filed for bankruptcy while Celsius and BlockFi, two bankrupt crypto lending firms with sizable mining wings, are likely going to have to restructure their operations. Another two mining companies, Marathon and Argo, are also at risk of declaring bankruptcy.\n\nRead more: Inside Core Scientific\u2019s Prearranged Bankruptcy\n\nThe situations vary by firm, but the main causes of the issue stem from BTC\u2019s depressed price and, often, poor treasury management. My colleague George Kaloudis simplified the picture by saying that over the last few years many mining companies pursued accelerated growth strategies financed by debt and other investments while often choosing to hold onto their mined coins.\n\n\"Many miners acted too deterministically,\" projecting bitcoin would hit $100,000, Juri Bulovic, head of mining at crypto mining and staking firm Foundry, which is owned by CoinDesk\u2019s parent company, Digital Currency Group, told CoinDesk\u2019s Eliza Gkritsi. The situation worked well when bitcoin\u2019s price was rising and the cost of financing expansion was cheap \u2013 two things thrown off course amid macroeconomic uncertainty and rising interest rates.\n\nAlready, outside firms have been stepping in to backstop losses and inject much-needed capital into the lagging professional mining sector. Galaxy Digital struck a $100 million deal with Argo, Binance has spun up a fund for distressed miners and just today investment giant BlackRock committed $17 million to bankrupt bitcoin miner Core Scientific.\n\nAlthough the mining sector is in a precarious position \u2013 fueled in part by unprecedented deployment of state-of-the-art mining equipment order and deployed during the heady days of 2021, when bitcoin hit a high of $69,000 \u2013 the industry isn\u2019t likely going to be wiped off the map. In addition to battle-tested firms deploying better treasury management, there are also a line of new financing options coming online \u2013 like derivatives options from Two Prime, which could allow miners to hedge their risk over mining bitcoin in a similar way as in other commodities markets like oil.\n\nMore capitulation and bankruptcies could come, and unprofitable miners may be taken offline. But considering the global sprawl of the mining industry, the sectors\u2019 committed activist investors and supporters and the growing importance of mining within the hydrocarbon and wider energy sector mining will remain. And the business might be better for its recent troubles.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

A report from CryptoCompare showed Binance\u2019s overall year-end crypto market share was 66.7%. Coinbase (COIN) came in second with a relatively tiny 8.2%.\n\n\u201cRetail crypto could enter a dark age that takes forever to exit\u201d should Binance fail, said Edward Moya, senior analyst at Oanda. \u201cBinance is too big \u2026 It is not healthy to have so much of the trading volume concentrated with any one exchange.\u201d\n\nChatter about the solvency of Binance increased significantly after the collapse of FTX, and the exchange did suffer some outflows for a short period, though things have stabilized since. A market share this high could become problematic for the industry if Binance were to encounter any issues, whether regulatory or mistrust from users.\n\nBinance is currently under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department over compliance with anti-money laundering laws and sanctions. The exchange also recently lost its auditor, Mazars Group, which announced a pause in its work with crypto exchanges looking to produce proof-of-reserves."

        "title": "Research: Bitcoin UTXOs grow despite bear market - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are often referred to as the fundamental building block of Bitcoin. As the Bitcoin network is built on an accounting model based on unspent outputs, they can be used to measure the overall state and growth of the network.\n\nChanges in the cumulative value settled through UTXOs, their number, and the percentage of them in profit or loss can indicate where the network stands and where it\u2019s heading.\n\nWhat are UTXOs?\n\nPut bluntly, an unspent transaction output is the amount of BTC that remains after every transaction. Every time a Bitcoin transaction takes place, existing inputs are deleted and new outputs are created. Outputs that aren\u2019t spent immediately become UTXOs tied to the sender.\n\nFor example, if an address with a balance of 1 BTC wants to send a transaction of 0.4 BTC, the transaction will break up the balance into two separate outputs: the 0.4 BTC paid to the receiver, and the 0.6 BTC that\u2019s left behind. The 0.6 BTC is \u201cunspent,\u201d returned to the sender, and becomes a UTXO that can be used as an input in later transactions.\n\nAlmost all Bitcoin transactions end up using unspent transaction outputs. Only transactions using a single unified data byte \u2014 i.e. transactions in increments of whole numbers \u2014 don\u2019t generate UTXOs. However, these transactions are rare enough that they can be ignored when looking at unspent output data.\n\nCryptoSlate\u2019s analysis of Bitcoin UTXOs showed that there has been continuous growth in the total number of UTXOs since 2018. The rising number of unspent outputs defied every instance of price volatility and continues to grow through the ongoing bear market. Positive growth in the UTXO set indicates increased network usage, while negative values show a contraction in network usage.\n\nData from Glassnode showed that the total set of Bitcoin UTXOs reached its all-time high in the first days of January, counting over 136 million UTXOs.\n\nThe persistent growth in the UTXO set shows that the network has been growing despite the bear market. Crypto winters have historically been periods of stagnating network growth, as low prices and uncertainty push many users out of the network. On the other hand, bull markets have historically triggered periods of fast network growth, as an increase in speculators drives the overall network usage up.\n\nUTXOs can also help determine future market momentum.\n\nLooking at the price stamp assigned at the time of the creation of each UTXO and comparing it to BTC\u2019s current price shows which outputs are in profit and which are in loss.\n\nAs of Jan. 3, around 100 million of UTXOs are in profit. This means that 70% of all unspent transaction outputs ever created have transacted with BTC below its current price. An above-average count of in-profit outputs has historically been associated with positive market momentum.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still too early to tell when the positive price action might occur. The 1-year rolling Z-Score of UTXOs in profit has last been positive at the end of 2021, suggesting that the bear market might continue well into 2023."

        "content": "On January 13, 2009, the genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain was mined by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, marking the first time in history that a completely digital and decentralized currency went online. In the 14 years and three halvings since, Bitcoin has grown to become one of the most important financial instruments, clearly demonstrating that a non-central bank-controlled currency is capable of challenging the established monetary order.\n\nWith that in mind, what important events have taken place in the last 14 years, and how has Bitcoin price fared through the ups and downs? What can we expect from Bitcoin going forward? Read along to find out the answer to these questions and more.\n\nOn its 14th birthday, Bitcoin\u2019s message rings louder than ever\n\nThe first Bitcoin transaction was sent by Satoshi Nakamoto to American cryptographer Hal Finney, along with a message criticizing government and bank actions in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWith the growing macroeconomic turmoil and the failure of central banks to keep up with inflation problems \u2013 in large part due to the unprecedented growth in money supply during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s artificially capped coin supply and decentralized network can be seen as the leading alternative to traditional, inherently inflationary fiat currencies.\n\n10 most important Bitcoin milestones\n\nBitcoin has reached numerous major milestones and faced several considerable obstacles over its nearly decade-and-a-half-long history. Here are 10 events we believe have had the biggest impact on Bitcoin so far:\n\nBetween its third halving on one end and FTX filing for bankruptcy on the other, Bitcoin has seen some remarkable market activity over the last couple of years.\n\nWhat can we expect from Bitcoin going forward? With the fourth Bitcoin halving approaching and favorable historical price data in play, our Bitcoin price prediction algorithm forecasts BTC price to grow by over +150% and break $40,000 in the next year. We\u2019ll explore that in more detail in the following section.\n\nBitcoin has never closed in the red zone 2 years in a row: Will the trend continue?\n\nBitcoin price decreased by over -60% over the span of the last 12 months. However, there is a strong bullish precedent in play that could spell a major trend reversal in the coming months.\n\nFor starters, Bitcoin has never closed in the negative two years in a row. Granted, there is a relatively short set of historical price data to work with. However, roughly speaking, Bitcoin has operated on 3 years of growth followed by 1 year of market retracement periods, at least so far.\n\nBitcoin price % Change Year-over-Year Jan 3, 2011 - Year 2 $0.295 No available data Jan 3, 2012 - Year 3 $4.88 +1,544% Jan 3, 2013 - Year 4 $13.40 +175% Jan 3, 2014 - Year 5 $818 +6,004% Jan 3, 2015 - Year 6 $284 -65% Jan 3, 2016 - Year 7 $429 +51% Jan 3, 2017 - Year 8 $1,044 +143% Jan 3, 2018 - Year 9 $15,079 +1,344% Jan 3, 2019 - Year 10 $3,844 -74% Jan 3, 2020 - Year 11 $7,317 +90% Jan 3, 2021 - Year 12 $32,878 +349% Jan 3, 2022 - Year 13 $46,424 +41% Jan 3, 2023 - Year 14 $16,729 -64%\n\nBitcoin has never closed in the red zone for 2 years in a row.\n\nThe main reason for this \u201c3 to 1\u201d cycle lies in the fact that Bitcoin halvings are scheduled to take place every 4 years. When a Bitcoin halving is triggered, BTC miners receive only half the reward that they were receiving before the halving. The next and 4th BTC halving \u2013 slated to occur between February 2024 and June 2024 \u2013 will see the miner reward rate drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, BTC investors are excited about upcoming halvings as they are seen as a positive influence on the Bitcoin price. Case in point, preceding halvings have always been accompanied by storing price growth, as can be seen from the Bitcoin halving chart down below.\n\nBitcoin halvings have been one of the most important BTC price drivers.\n\nThere is no question that Bitcoin, along with most crypto and traditional assets, performed quite poorly last year. With more interest rate hikes slated for 2023, financial markets and crypto assets could continue crashing, at least in the upcoming months.\n\nHowever, there is a clear chance of recovery in the cards, highlighted by the cyclical nature of Bitcoin\u2019s price and its correlation with periodical Bitcoin halvings. This has made Bitcoin one of the most popular long-term crypto investments."

        "title": "A Bet on Bitcoin is Gambling on the Whales - SchiffGold",
        "content": "A Bet on Bitcoin is Gambling on the Whales\n\nby SchiffGold 0\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been suspiciously stable following the epic collapse of FTX less than 2 months ago The whales are defending the Bitcoin price at $16,000 waiting for interest to flood back into Bitcoin It\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger hype train than 2021 which means Bitcoin may not make a new all-time high\n\nAn Artificial Market\n\nThe Bitcoin market has completely flat-lined since Nov. 9. This was directly after the FTX collapse, which I wrote about back in November. In that analysis, I mentioned how I had been raising concerns before the collapse about how quiet the Bitcoin market had looked over the summer of 2022.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Three Arrows and Luna collapse, the Bitcoin market had been seeing major weakness from November 2021 up through May 2022, falling from $67k to $30k. This weakness actually helped perpetuate the collapse of Luna and Three Arrows.\n\nThe collapse in Luna and Three Arrows then caused the price of Bitcoin to drop below $20k. Looking like it could drop to $10k in short order. However, immediately following the drop below $20k, the market stabilized until the FTX collapse. That pushed the price down another 20% to the $16k region.\n\nSince FTX collapsed, the market has gone even quieter. The price has been bouncing between a very tight range of 16.5k and 17.5k for almost two months now.\n\nThe chart below shows this price action compared to the S&P 500. While the S&P has continued to bounce around the last two months, Bitcoin has gone incredibly quiet. This seems extremely unlikely after such a major event unless interested parties are in the market defending the price.\n\nFigure: 1 SPY vs BTC\n\nOne of the primary metrics used to evaluate price fluctuations is volatility. This is the standard deviation of the price, annualized. The chart below shows the volatility of the S&P and Bitcoin going back to early 2021.\n\nAs can be seen, the volatility in Bitcoin is consistently above the S&P 500 by a wide margin. Bitcoin tracked around 75% whereas the S&P was around 15%. It should be noted that the volatility lines below are actually correlated, as the S&P became more volatile so did Bitcoin. That remained true until the Fall of 2022.\n\nThe 30-day rolling volatility in Bitcoin plunged in October and actually dipped below the S&P volatility for a brief period on Oct. 24 . When FTX happened, volatility spiked, but it was very short-lived. On Dec 7th, the 30-day vol of Bitcoin was 77%. This plunged to 32% on Dec 12th as the trading period around FTX faded past 30 days. 30-day rolling Bitcoin volatility finished the year at 27%, dipping below the 28% low seen before the FTX spike.\n\nThink about this! After each successive collapse, the market becomes more stable and less volatile. It\u2019s not even seeing a price rebound as rumor/speculation becomes fact. You would expect either a price rebound if the bad news had been priced in or further selling if the market had not anticipated an event.\n\nFigure: 2 SPY and BTC Volatility\n\nThis would be like the stock market flat-lining directly after the collapse of Lehman or the Covid lockdowns (the market actually saw massive turnarounds). One might argue that this is proof that Bitcoin is becoming more mature and cleaning out the deadwood. But this does not make sense because markets do not stabilize in the wake of such uncertainty. They become more volatile! This is especially true when surrounding markets also increase in volatility.\n\nThe chart below plots the difference between the S&P and Bitcoin volatility shown above. At the end of December, Bitcoin and the S&P volatility were separated by only 1,100 bps. Over the past 3 months, as the S&P has become more volatile, Bitcoin has become less volatile. How is this possible? Especially in the wake of an epic exchange collapse, how does the price of Bitcoin just flat-line?\n\nThe answer: the Bitcoin whales are supporting this market. They have put a floor around $16,000 and are defending that floor. Why? Because it is easier to defend a floor than drive the recovery after a big fall. If the price were to drop to $10k it would take more effort to get back to $16k than simply defending $16k. Furthermore, if the market looks stable, then holders will be less tempted to sell. If the market were to drop below support, it could create a cascading selling event, imploding the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThis is not just speculation either. A recent paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found rampant market manipulation in the smaller and less regulated exchanges. Kitco provided a good summary of the findings last week.\n\nFigure: 3 Volatility/Standard Deviation\n\nThis drop is even more surprising around the holidays when Bitcoin typically picks up in volatility. In fact, Bitcoin just saw its least volatile December since 2012! The S&P however, just saw its most volatile December since 2018.\n\nThis does not make any sense. FTX collapse and a volatile stock market should be driving volatility higher in Bitcoin not lower. It is a flat market because the whales have their thumbs on the scale.\n\nFigure: 4 December Volatility\n\nThe whale\u2019s best bet is to stabilize the price and let the market consolidate at a high price point. They hope that if they can bide their time at a higher price point, it will be easier to blast the price higher once (if?) interest in Bitcoin returns.\n\nRight now, the whales just want the market to go into hibernation at a high price point and consolidate there. It\u2019s working too. The chart below shows the Google Trends for both Bitcoin and Ether. They are both at lows last seen in November 2020.\n\nFigure: 5 Price and Volume\n\nThe chart below shows even more evidence of a market that is waning in interest. Trade volume has gone nearly straight down after peaking on November 23rd. 30-day average rolling volume is now at the lowest level since May, before the Luna blow-up, Three Arrows Collapse, and FTX collapse. We are less than 60 days from the FTX collapse and yet trade volume is simply evaporating.\n\nFigure: 6 Price and Volume on Log Scale\n\nAnother dataset to consider is the Comex futures market. Bitcoin futures started trading in 2017. Open interest has actually stayed relatively flat since September 2022.\n\nFigure: 7 Comex Open Interest\n\nThe flat open interest was in the face of futures trade volume plummeting in December to the lowest level since August 2021. The futures market is a reflection of institutional interest, and this market is also getting quiet.\n\nFigure: 8 Comex Volume\n\nThe CFTC breaks down open interest into different categories in its Commitment of Traders (COT) reports. That report shows that the net position of longs has actually stayed relatively stable. The only change over the past several months came on the short side as Dealers took over some of the Lev money shorts positions.\n\nFigure: 9 CFTC Net Long Short Contracts\n\nWhile the Asset Manager position above looks relatively stable. the chart below shows the notional amount of open contracts. Looking at the two charts together shows that Asset Managers have sat in their positions and watched their position value collapse from $1.45B to $408M since October 2021. This represents a 72% fall in value in just over a year.\n\nThe Asset Managers have been crushed, yet they are still holding on. Another round of selling could cause the Asset Managers to finally throw in the towel and sell. Not only would this crush the price but it would nearly wipe out the Bitcoin futures market.\n\nAs of December, Asset Managers hold 93% of the net long position in Bitcoin. If they cut bait and run, the futures market will see open interest completely crash. This is another reason why the whales are defending the price so hard. If the institutions leave, they might not come back.\n\nFigure: 10 CFTC Net Long Short Notional\n\nFinally, we can look at the Grey Scale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) premium/discount to gauge where market sentiment is at the moment. The current GBTC discount is approaching 50%. This means that you can buy Bitcoin at half the price if you use GBTC!\n\nFigure: 11 GBTC Premium and Discount\n\nThe chart below uses the GBTC discount and premium to derive a market-implied price. The current market implied price is right around $9k. This is the lowest level since April 2020!\n\nFigure: 12 GBTC Implied Price\n\nWhat\u2019s the point?\n\nIn the wake of the epic FTX collapse, the Bitcoin market has gone extremely quiet. Way too quiet , especially given the volatility seen in the general stock market. The explanation is the whales defend the price.\n\nIf the whales let the price fall back below $10k, it would take a massive effort to reinflate the bubble. Think about how Bitcoin got to $60k. In 2021 you had:\n\nThe Fed pumping trillions of dollars Every asset in the world surging in value Non-stop coverage of Bitcoin across every media platform The surge in the NFT market\n\n\n\nEverything went right and the whales could ride the wave, unloading their Bitcoin on the new entrants. 2021 was peak Bitcoin though. How do you generate more hype than 2021 to sucker in any new investor? This is the problem the whales face, there won\u2019t be another catalyst that will enable them to dump their Bitcoin on the next round of suckers.\n\nTrue believers keep talking about Bitcoin winters and how they all eventually end with each summer brighter than the previous. It\u2019s brighter because each summer has seen greater interest and hype. Unfortunately, if you were not a buyer in 2021, and you aren\u2019t buying this dip\u2026 you probably won\u2019t be buying in the future.\n\nThe whales are waiting for the winter to end, but it\u2019s more likely this winter will never end for Bitcoin. Given the challenges ahead in 2023, it\u2019s time for astute investors to convert digital nothing into hard currency. Physical supply shortages in precious metals are a real thing , unlike the superficial supply constraint of Bitcoin.\n\nI am in no way predicting an imminent collapse of Bitcoin. But the market is way too quiet. How much support can the whales offer? Are you willing to bet big on the whales continuing to defend the current $16k level?\n\nFurthermore, the next Bitcoin catalyst will likely spark more selling. This could be another exchange collapse, or even something breaking the general stock market causing money to flee risk assets. If the $16,000-floor breaks, it could be a quick move down to $10k as the whales run out of firepower. This type of manipulation and dependence on a few big players does not exist in other markets. If you trust a few whales to protect your gamble on a digital token barely 10 years old, then so be it. Otherwise, consider something with a much longer track record and far more stable: buy some gold!\n\nData Source: Tiingo , Coin Market Cap , and the Block\n\nSome of these views and charts can be accessed through the Exploring Finance Portfolio Builder tool\n\nGet Peter Schiff\u2019s key gold headlines in your inbox every week \u2013 click here \u2013 for a free subscription to his exclusive weekly email updates.\n\nCall 1-888-GOLD-160 and speak with a Precious Metals Specialist today!"

        "title": "Happy birthday to a 'giant Ponzi scheme', from bitcoin's accidental co-creator - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIt\u2019s 14 years exactly since the launch of bitcoin and one big mystery remains unanswered: why is the front page headline of a UK newspaper from Saturday, January 3, 2009, baked into the code of the first bitcoin block?\n\nJanuary 3 has become Independence Day among those who fear centralisation, with the genesis block their digital Liberty Bell. Hiding a bank bailout reference in bitcoin\u2019s foundation stone was more than a timestamp or lorem ipsum, they reason; it was Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s way of telling the world that crypto meant freedom. No more reckless government intervention in monetary policy, no more debasement of fiat to save private enterprises, etc.\n\nThis is not a view shared by Francis Elliott, former political editor of The Times, who wrote the story. Crypto is \u201cnothing more than a giant Ponzi scheme\u201d and \u201can absolute scam\u201d, he told FT Alphaville.\n\n\u201cI first heard about my connection [to bitcoin] maybe six, seven maybe eight years ago* when people started tagging me on Twitter. They all thought it was really cute that I\u2019d only just found out,\u201d he said, emphasising the back half of the sentence by adopting a Californian accent.\n\nElliott said he has never bought crypto. Nor has he considered turning his accidental fame into a career as a crypto influencer. He also, when prompted, denied being Satoshi.\n\nNevertheless, coinbros would often find him online and offer him \u201cbits of bitcoins\u201d that he deposited in a wallet created specifically for the purpose. These unprompted donations amounted to \u00a31500 at the market peak, which was around when he cashed out after gifting \u201cabout \u00a310 each\u201d in tokens to his sons.\n\nElliott offers no explanation as to why his slightly speculative story about UK bad bank proposals became embedded in crypto\u2019s alpha block.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those stories I was relieved was right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an OK source but . . . well, it was a Christmas New-Year story. I\u2019ve no idea why [Nakamoto] used that piece or who he is. Perhaps he knew something we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBecause of its place in crypto history, copies of The Times from January 3, 2009, have held their value better than most cryptocurrencies. Back-issue websites and online auction houses show zero availability. The \u201cGenesis Block Newspaper\u201d market quotes asking prices of up to $1.3mn and claims \u201conly eight verified copies\u201d exist, which might ring false for anyone who has ever visited a UK library.\n\nHas Elliott kept a souvenir copy?\n\n\u201cI did get the front page framed, but I lost it,\u201d he said.\n\n* A Twitter search pins the exact date of discovery to December 18, 2013."

        "content": "Zion, a new social media app on the blockchain, is starting to gain momentum. By bringing base features people need from a social app, Zion might become one of the first web3-based social media platforms. Mainly focusing on communication and payments, Zion could be a future super app (similar to how Elon wants to turn Twitter into \u201cX\u201d or WeChat).\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nLike Web3 wallets, Zion allows anyone to log into any site on the web without creating an account while having their preferences intact, as your preference data is not erased but is owned by you. Zion team explained how it works, \u201cWhen you join Zion, you will be assigned a new DID as well as a user name. This DID will be secured by a 12-word seed phrase to ensure your privacy and security. Zion has no access to these cryptographic private keys.\u201d\n\nFeatures of Zion\n\nZion mainly offers three features:\n\nFirst, the app shows communities with various interests, like chess, Porsche lovers, or conservationists. This allows the user to find people who have similar interests to them. Conversations are in the shapes of threads that feel \u2018personal and contextual.\u2019\n\nFocused on safety and security, they offer an encrypted chat function.\n\nAs expected from any app trying to be a \u2018super app,\u2019 payments are essential to enable in-app purchases and be used as part of revenue by taking a percentage from the money transfers. They use Bitcoin Lightning Network to accomplish this.\n\nWhat is perhaps most exciting about this app is its true peer to peer network. The data produced on this app isn\u2019t stored in any central server but is based on cryptographic keys and signatures, meaning is owned and reachable solely by the user. One of the best symptoms of this is cutting out the manipulation of algorithms. The decentralized node acts as a secure, private server, accessible only by your private key, giving people full custody over their data.\n\nZion launched its first version in August 2021 and the second in June 2022. In an official release, Zion said the v2 would use a Decentralized Web Platform from Block, Jack Dorsey\u2019s company, formerly called Square, and will be built in Web5 (web2+web3=web5).\n\nHow to Join\n\nThe wait list for Zion is available on its official site. The app can be downloaded on both iOS and Android.\n\nThe product will be rolled out in stages. Currently over 60k people have joined the waitlist."

A number of well-known firms within the industry have either declared bankruptcy or are in the midst of wide-ranging restructuring plans to avoid it.\n\nIn late December Core Scientific, which was once one of the industry's largest Bitcoin miners, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Texas.\n\nThat same month, Bitcoin miner Greenidge announced that there was \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its capacity to continue as a business, saying that its Board of Directors was actively discussing the possibility of voluntary bankruptcy amid complex plans for debt cancellation."

        "content": "Bitcoin, a highly innovative, completely decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency, has seen an exponential rise in prominence and usership since its inception in 2009. Owing to its wide variety of uses, it enjoys unique advantages over both fiat currency and commodities.\n\nHowever, in recent years, while Bitcoin has become increasingly popular, it has also gained many detractors. One of the charges leveled against Bitcoin is that it has a substantial negative environmental impact. But this charge is simply exaggerated at best, and downright false at worst.\n\nAside from relying on, let\u2019s say controversial, data, the question of negative impact is relative to positive impact, a phenomenon that doesn\u2019t grab as many headlines.\n\nThe many ways in which Bitcoin can be part of the future of clean energy are often overlooked, and when it comes to Bitcoin\u2019s energy usage, the picture isn\u2019t nearly as negative as the media makes out.\n\nMoney requires energy\n\nThere is no question Bitcoin requires a lot of energy and computing power to operate, but its detractors are entirely missing the point. Money, or pretty much anything in this world, inevitably requires energy, and a sound monetary system is eminently worth investing resources to protect.\n\nMoney, the primary means by which we store and transmit value, has a longstanding link to energy. Indeed, many items used as early forms of money existed as unforgeable physical evidence of the expenditure of time and energy required to create them.\n\nThis is similar to how commodities such as gold are used as stores of value in modern times, due to relative scarcity and the energy involved in mining. In these monetary systems, the value expended is proportionate to the value people get from using it.\n\nBitcoin follows a concept similar to this, but with one very important difference \u2014 a finite supply. As with any sound store of value, Bitcoin serves as a proof of work, but while gold is extracted from the earth, Bitcoin is a proof of digital work carried out by specialized software.\n\nThis contrasts significantly with fiat money, which is merely printed as and when governments please, without proof of work to back it up. Lacking scarcity, fiat money is subject to inflation, which acts as a stealth tax on people\u2019s savings. At present, given the high inflation rates, it makes sense that more and more people are looking to alternatives such as Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin mining incentivizes energy efficiency\n\nAs with traditional mining, Bitcoin mining is a costly operation. While there is certainly a reward for miners, this comes at a price. The cost of mining Bitcoin varies significantly from place to place, depending on the cost of electricity.\n\nConsequently, Bitcoin miners have a clear profit incentive to use energy efficiently and sparingly. They also have an incentive to conduct their operations in countries or regions with optimal infrastructure and cheap energy, which is often renewable energy.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s potential for innovation in terms of optimizing energy efficiency is a factor that has been overlooked by the studies preferred by those determined to vilify Bitcoin as an enemy of the environment. In recent years, the percentage of the Bitcoin industry running on renewable energy continues to increase, standing at around 58.5 percent in late 2021.\n\nThe U.S. dollar has a far larger carbon footprint\n\nIn stark contrast to Bitcoin miners, the fiat monetary system has no such incentives to optimize efficiency. This is particularly true of the U.S. dollar, which, after having its link to gold severed by President Nixon in 1971, subsequently became heavily linked to the global oil industry.\n\nStarting with Saudi Arabia following negotiations in 1974, OPEC nations agreed to the global oil market being denominated in dollars, and to trade being conducted in dollars. This created a constant demand for the U.S. dollar. The deal also meant the United States would have to offer military aid and equipment, and become heavily invested in the Middle East in order to ensure access to cheaper oil.\n\nClose ties between the interests of the U.S. government and the global oil industry over the past number of decades has served to subsidize one of the most environmentally damaging forms of energy. The development of renewable energy may well have unfolded very differently in the absence of the U.S. dollar\u2019s interests being so closely linked to those of the oil industry.\n\nHow much energy does Bitcoin use?\n\nOne of the primary studies making alarmist claims about the unique environmental evils of Bitcoin has been criticized for having made a number of incorrect assumptions. In particular, the inclusion of unprofitable mining rigs should cast serious doubts over the findings, as any rational miner would switch these rigs off more than 99 percent of the time.\n\nThe assumptions made by the original study would, if true, mean that Bitcoin miners were losing billions of dollars in revenue. Taking this into account, the carbon emissions of Bitcoin mining were deemed by others to have been overestimated by a factor of 4.5.\n\nCritics promote the idea that Bitcoin accounts for an unacceptably large proportion of the world\u2019s energy consumption. However, it actually represents less than 0.1 percent of global energy usage.\n\nIt is estimated that Bitcoin currently has at least 100 million users worldwide. Yet, even if it was adopted as a payment system by over a billion people, this share of the world\u2019s energy consumption would still not be expected to exceed one percent. A flawed reasoning put forward by critics is that the increase in Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption as more people begin to use it will follow a linear pattern, when this is not the case.\n\nMoreover, to put Bitcoin\u2019s annual energy consumption into perspective, it is less than is consumed by either Christmas lights in the U.S. alone, digital advertising, or the cruise ship industry, yet it is consistently subject to unique scrutiny and misplaced condemnation.\n\nOn a fundamental level, to single out Bitcoin ahead of other more costly energy uses implies a belief that Bitcoin, hard money in cyberspace, is of a lesser value to decorative lights or cruise ships, even if Bitcoin has a far broader user base.\n\nBitcoin miners are driving innovative solutions\n\nBitcoin miners are able to relocate to any suitable location. As such, they are in an ideal position to exploit stranded energy assets. Some of the innovative ways in which Bitcoin miners operate involve, among others, feeding off waste energy and operating reserves from power plants.\n\nFor instance, in Canada, Bitcoin miners have been able to make use of otherwise wasted energy by channeling waste gas from an oil well in order to power Bitcoin mining computers.\n\nBy using this waste gas, the Bitcoin miners are actually able to reduce carbon emissions rather than add to them. Similar solutions can be made for other sources of energy, such as drawing geothermal energy from volcanoes in El Salvador.\n\nSo much of the world\u2019s energy is waste energy, produced during hours of low demand. Issues arise in terms of transmitting energy across space and time. Much of the energy consumed by the Bitcoin network is energy that would not otherwise be available for consumption elsewhere. Instead, it would simply go to waste. Bitcoin is providing huge opportunities to harness energy that would otherwise be wasted or stranded.\n\nEven for those uninterested in owning any Bitcoin, one of the strongest arguments in favor of embracing Bitcoin\u2019s innovative potential is how it strengthens the power grid. Beyond its credentials as a store of value, Bitcoin can also play a role in mitigating the impact on power infrastructure during crises such as natural disasters.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin mining operations contribute to creating a more resilient power grid as they can be used as excess power reserves. This means that, if needed, they can contribute additional power to the grid even when power generation capacity is compromised.\n\nOverall, accusations that Bitcoin is destroying the environment appear completely baseless when taking a proportionate look at its energy consumption, especially relative to the value and revolutionary potential it presents. Moreover, market incentives for miners to use energy sparingly coupled with the innovative ways to make use of wasted energy while strengthening the power grid only further add to Bitcoin\u2019s green credentials.\n\nFor more content on Bitcoin and the environment, be sure to check out our video below.\n\nIf you are interested in Bitcoin, decentralization, and innovations in technology more broadly, be sure to check out our annual LibertyCon Europe.

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nAccording to data from Nasdaq and Ycharts, the Ethereum network had a higher total transaction volume compared to Bitcoin in 2022. Specifically, there were 338 percent more transactions on the Ethereum network (408.5 million) than on the Bitcoin network (93.1 million). The average daily number of transactions on Ethereum was around 1.1 million, while the average daily number of transactions on Bitcoin was 255,000. Despite this, Bitcoin has remained more popular in terms of online search interest.Transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network were more consistent and regular compared to those on the Ethereum network, which saw more fluctuations. This was attributed to times of increased demand, such as during the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other activities that required a lot of gas (a measure of the amount of computing power needed to perform a certain action on the Ethereum network), such as the minting of XEN.Ethereum has continued to have higher transaction volumes in 2023, with the number of transactions on the Ethereum network on January 2 reaching 924,614, which is a 300 percent increase compared to the Bitcoin network on the same day (229,191).The person who shared the data on Reddit expressed scepticism about the idea that the Ethereum network could surpass the Bitcoin network in terms of transaction volume and activity, a phenomenon known as a \"flippening.\" However, they noted that those who advocate for a flippening now have more reason to do so, given the current transaction volumes. A flippening occurs when one blockchain surpasses another in a particular metric, such as transaction volume or activity.Although Ethereum may currently have higher transaction and activity levels, Bitcoin remains the most searched crypto online. On January 1, data from \"In Bitcoin We Trust\" showed that Bitcoin had the highest number of monthly Google searches globally in 2022, with 28.4 million searches. Ethereum did not even come in second or third place in terms of search popularity. These spots were occupied by memecoins Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, respectively. According to the data, Ethereum was in fourth place with 3.8 million global monthly searches."

        "content": "Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF), a cryptocurrency mining company, has published its latest Bitcoin mining update for December 2022 and the entire year. While the publicly-listed miner produced 50% more cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies By using cryptography, virtual currencies, known as cryptocurrencies, are nearly counterfeit-proof digital currencies that are built on blockchain technology.

The term, cryptocurrency derives from the origin of the encryption techniques that are employed to secure the netw Read this Term than it did in 2021, it increased its BTC sales to cover ongoing operating costs and liabilities.\n\nBitfarms Closes 2022 with Production Increase\n\nAccording to the press release published on Tuesday, Bitfarms mined 496 BTC in December, compared to 453 mined last month and 363 mined in the same period a year earlier. The newest production number translates to a significant year-over-year increase and visible growth of available computing power.\n\nThe available Bitfarm's hash rate has doubled over the year, rising from 2.2 exahashes per second (EH/s) reported in December 2021 to 4.5 EH/s today.\n\nFor the entire of 2022, the number of BTC mined reached 5,167, growing 49.6% compared to the 3,453 reported for 2021. This means that the company mined more than 14 BTC daily during the last year. The average for December came in at 16 BTC, the equivalent of $265,600 per day, considering market prices as of 31 December 2022.\n\nKeep Reading OKX Joins Growing List of Crypto Exchanges with Singapore's MPI License\n\n\"With the 496 BTC mined in December, our total 2022 BTC mined reached 5,167, up 50% over 2021. We averaged 16.0 BTC mined per day during December. In the month, we deployed new miners and underclocked our least cost-efficient miners. This improved their efficiency by 15%, resulting in a reduction of nearly 4 MW of power consumption and representing substantial cost savings,\" Ben Gagnon, the Chief Mining Officer of Bitfarms, said.\n\nBitfarms Mining Operations\n\nIn December, Bitfarms temporarily suspended Quebec farm operations in support of the local community amid the onslaught of extreme winter, restoring some 4,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of power to the local grids. Such energy curtailments occur every winter and are a normal part of the miner's operations.\n\nHowever, the company has expanded its operations at two other farms, providing access to additional electrical power and mining potential.\n\n\"In December, we energized the remaining portions of The Bunker and Garlock farms, executing our Canadian expansion plan two and one-half months ahead of schedule,\" Geoff Morphy, the CEO of Bitfarms, said.\n\n\"We have positioned ourselves for strategic growth with minimal cash outlay in 2023.\"\n\nBitfarms Sees Higher Production with Lower Revenues\n\nAlthough the publicly-listed miner was able to increase its Bitcoin production significantly, the overall financials seemed to deteriorate in 2022. According to the financial report for the three months that ended 30 September 2022, revenue stood at $33.2 million, falling from $44.8 million reported in the same period a year earlier.\n\nNet loss in the third quarter was $84.8 million after the company earned $23.7 million a year earlier. In the first nine months of 2022, the miner's loss reached $222.2 million. The main reason for the deepening loss is the rapidly falling prices of the major cryptocurrencies.

In November, it redistributed 853 BTC, while the number rose to 1,755 BTC. By comparison, only 35 BTC had been sold a year earlier. However, the company managed to repay the loan secured in BTC fully."

        "title": "Dear Elon Musk: Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin has the ability to scale - CoinGeek",
        "content": "The following letter, originally written by Bryan Daugherty (Director of Blockchain Policy at Bitcoin Association for BSV), was sent to Elon Musk (business magnate, investor, and current CEO of Twitter). The author has granted permission to publish this letter publicly in the hope that it will reach a wider audience and attempt to gain the attention of Elon Musk.\n\nDear Mr. Musk,\n\nI hope this letter finds you well and in good spirits. As a highly respected innovator in the tech industry, I wanted to express my admiration for your work and the many ways in which you continue to contribute towards the advancement of society, both culturally and technologically.\n\nBased on your public statements, it seems that we have differing viewpoints when it comes to the utility of blockchain technology, specifically proof-of-work consensus mechanisms for data and financial interchange.\n\nUnbeknownst to most in the digital asset space, including some of the foremost experts, Bitcoin has the ability to scale, as originally expressed by Satoshi Nakamoto in April of 2009: \u201cBitcoin can already scale much larger than [Visa] with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling.\u201d\n\nNavigating the complex landscape of social crypto influencers, Ponzi schemes, and illegal security offerings can be difficult, but it is important to understand that blockchain technology represents a different type of opportunity\u2014one that is less volatile and speculative, and mirrors some of the greatest technological leap\u2019s humanity has experienced, albeit without the same level of fanfare.\n\nIn terms of whether proof-of-work can scale, the answer may not be as complicated as the journey to understand it. Since block #556767 was mined on November 15th, 2018, BSV developers have been breaking proof-of-work scaling barriers which were once believed to be inconceivable.\n\nMNP, a prominent accounting, tax, and business consulting firm in Canada, has conducted extensive research on the topic of Bitcoin and has recently published two reports on the importance of the original Bitcoin protocol, the impact of changes to the popular BTC version on its capabilities, and how the competing version, BSV, has been able to harness the native scaling capabilities that were present when the system was first released.\n\nUnbounded scaling enables new possibilities in the realm of microtransactions, IPv6 compatibility, extreme data efficiency, verifiable identity, and secure critical infrastructure, providing a great opportunity for innovators like yourself to capitalize on the most efficient, resilient, globally stable, and secure data distribution model.\n\nAs an example, SpaceX could use IPv6 in combination with BSV to transmit financial transactions securely and efficiently with its customers for its internet service. Tesla could use BSV to trace the origin of materials in its supply chain management, track and maintain vehicles, trade energy, or even utilize IPv6 to enable secure communication between vehicles, charging stations, and other devices. In addition, utilizing BSV blockchain as a cybersecurity solution, it is possible to protect the internal network of every company against unauthorized access or data breach.\n\nThis is due to Bitcoin\u2019s native ability to monetize, manage, and secure data. Often overlooked by most, Bitcoin is the fusion of data (bits) and coin (finance). With the capability to currently handle over 50,000 transactions per second, it is now possible to send micropayments, monetize data, transfer data, and capture an immutable time-stamped audit trail of all activity on a network.\n\nThe UTXO model of Bitcoin makes it scalable and capable of parallel processing, enabling almost instantaneous, real-time payments with settlement times of just seconds and fees that are a fraction of a cent (less than 1/5000th of a penny). The potential uses and benefits of Bitcoin are virtually limitless.\n\nOne of the key advantages of using BSV as the underlying infrastructure on a platform like Twitter, is the potential to allow users to earn micropayments for their content. By utilizing BSV-based tokens, loyalty points, or digital assets, users can be rewarded for producing high quality content that is valuable to the community. This not only encourages users to create higher quality content, but it also helps to establish a more sustainable business model for the platform.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, using a scalable blockchain like BSV could also give users greater control over their data. With traditional social media platforms, users have little say in how their data is used or who has access to it. By storing user data on the BSV blockchain, users can have greater control over who has access to their information and how it is used.\n\nFurthermore, a BSV-based social media platform could also have a native marketplace for users to create, buy, and sell digital assets, as well as monetize content such as art, music, and blogs. This would open up new revenue streams for both the platform and its users.\n\nUsing a blockchain like BSV could also enable in-app payments, allowing users to make purchases easily and securely within the app. This could be particularly useful for purchasing premium content or accessing exclusive features such as with Twitter Blue.\n\nFinally, I wanted to applaud your efforts in respect to the Twitter Files. It is of utmost importance that transparency and accountability is a high priority for social media platforms, especially in light of increasing levels of cyber-bullying and fake accounts.\n\nOverall, I believe that the adoption of a blockchain like BSV has the potential to revolutionize social media platforms like Twitter and bring numerous benefits to both the platform and its users. I hope that you will consider this perspective and the potential for these technologies to improve the user experience and business model of Twitter.\n\nI would like to request the opportunity to further discuss the potential benefits of the BSV Blockchain, as well as to invite you to the London Blockchain Conference on May 31- June 2nd at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London. This conference will showcase innovative technologies and businesses working to transform industries and build the new internet of value. I truly believe it would be a valuable opportunity for you to see for yourself the potential of this technology and would be honored if you were my VIP guest.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBryan W. Daugherty \u2013 CCI, CBI, SME\n\nPublic Policy Director \u2013 Bitcoin Association for BSV Blockchain\n\nWatch: London Blockchain Conference 2023 brings government enterprise onto the blockchain\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "14 years since Genesis Block: The world still needs Bitcoin's original vision - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Happy Genesis Block Day! January 3 is the 14th anniversary of Bitcoin\u2019s Block Zero, its anchor in time. That time, in 2009, was one of economic turmoil\u2014and the aftershocks from that turmoil are still rocking our world in 2023.\n\nBut first, a reminder of how the \u201cGenesis Block,\u201d as Block 0 has come to be known, is not like other Bitcoin blocks.\n\nFirstly, the Genesis Block was never \u201cmined\u201d like every other Bitcoin block. That started with Block #1 when Satoshi Nakamoto released the software on SourceForge. The hash from Block #0 was done with different software and hard-coded into the original Bitcoin protocol.\n\nAs the man behind the \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d name, Dr. Craig S. Wright, tells it, Block #1 was mined six days after the Genesis Block. The Bitcoin software \u201cfell over\u201d after machines on Dr. Wright\u2019s rural server farm patched and rebooted, requiring a trip to the farm and urgent reconfiguration before the network could begin its 14-year (so far) journey for real.\n\n\u201cThe network forked and split, and it was a big mess to say the least,\u201d Dr. Wright wrote.\n\nWhenever someone on Twitter asks, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t Craig Wright spend Bitcoins from the Genesis Block?\u201d it\u2019s a sign that person knows nothing about Bitcoin. It\u2019s impossible for anyone to \u201cspend\u201d those coins.\n\n\u201cI always find it strange to see how people react as if 50 bitcoin in the genesis block mattered,\u201d Dr. Wright wrote in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe so-called lost bitcoin from the genesis block do not exist as spendable bitcoin; it is an anchor. The problem people have when they look through glasses tainted with greed is that they don\u2019t see the simple facts, but rather paint the scenario with one of their desire. The first thing to remember is that there were no bitcoin sales in January 2009. Bitcoin was a system that cost money to run and create, and yet had no value. When asked about the lost value of the genesis block, the calculation is simple: 50 bitcoin times zero.\u201d\n\nChancellor is still on the brink\n\n\u201cChancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d was the Times headline. Satoshi hid in the first block\u2019s coinbase hash as a timestamp to prove there had been no mining on the Bitcoin network before he released the software to the public.\n\n\u201cThe Chancellor will decide within weeks whether to pump billions more into the economy,\u201d the original article in the Times said. In 2009 these seemed like desperate measures, and they were. Since 2009, though, governments across the Western world have indeed pumped billions, even trillions more, into their economies. Satoshi was making a statement on irresponsible government interventions in the economy and their eventual erosion on markets.\n\n\u201cThey actively sought to incentivise bad behaviour and push in typical Keynesian style the problem down the road. It would be a bigger problem, but it would be someone else\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nWell, now it\u2019s 2023, and it has indeed become someone else\u2019s problem: Ours. Western economies are currently struggling with high inflation, unemployment, and even food and energy shortages as they lurch from one crisis to another.\n\nTo give some idea of the tumultuous economic times we live in: The U.K.\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the Genesis Block was Alistair Darling, who held the office for just short of three years. In the decade following Darling\u2019s tenure, three other men held the job. However, in 2022 alone, there were four different Chancellors\u2014and three of those were in the second half of the year.\n\nIf Satoshi\u2019s hidden message in the Genesis Block was a call for less intervention and more honesty in the monetary system, we\u2019re sorry to say that only Bitcoin still stands as a representation of that honesty.\n\nEven Bitcoin became corrupted in the years following 2009, with BTC and the Core developers (along with most exchanges) still \u201cpassing off\u201d BTC as the real Bitcoin. It\u2019s not. And despite years of thefts and scams in the digital asset world, proponents still argue a form of the old \u201ccode is law\u201d cliche.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, a.k.a. Craig Wright, is still battling that corruption today. Only BSV still follows the original Bitcoin protocol rules as they existed in 2009, and hopefully, someday, the wider world will recognize it as such. Code-law is increasingly taking a back seat to human law also, and Dr. Wright is currently arguing in the courts to implement proper procedures (in both code and law) for asset recovery.\n\nHis success there would offer Bitcoiners protection against large-scale scams and thefts, at least. If you can prove you own the coins to a judge, they could and should be yours again, no matter who holds the keys.\n\nJust like the economy at large, Bitcoin is a long-term struggle against the worse aspects of human nature. In 14 years, it hasn\u2019t eliminated dishonesty and bad decisions, and it probably won\u2019t\u2014but it does offer the world a better alternative to the systems we currently have.\n\nWatch: Dr. Craig Wright on TEDx Talks\u2014Decentralisation\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "During a year plagued by crises such as the collapse of FTX and Celsius, data shows that crypto exchange Binance has emerged as the clear \u201cwinner\u201d of 2022 according to Arcane Research.\n\nA Jan. 3 report from Arcane highlighted that Binance saw its market dominance soar throughout 2022. As of Dec. 28 last year, it had captured 92% of the Bitcoin (BTC) spot market and 61% of the BTC derivatives market by volume:\n\n\u201cThere are no other evident \u2018winners\u2019 of 2022 other than Binance when it comes to the crypto market structure and market dominance. No matter how you look at it in terms of trading activity, Binance is the crypto market.\u201d\n\nBinance\u2019s BTC spot market dominance was 45% at the start of 2022 meaning that it more than doubled, while its share of the BTC derivatives market increased by almost one third.\n\nReal BTC daily volume vs Binance spot volume vs Binance market share. Source: Arcane Research.\n\nThe \u201cspot trading volume\u201d is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin being transacted on spot exchanges on any given day.\n\nThe report suggests the increase in Binance\u2019s BTC spot market dominance predated the fallout of the second largest exchange by volume FTX, and began to surge after it removed fees for certain trading pairs on Jul. 7, 2022.\n\nThe exchange also made some notable acquisitions to boost its global coverage in 2022 such as the Japanese trading platform Sakura Exchange BitCoin and Indonesian digital currency brokerage firm Tokocrypto.\n\nBinance has been one of the few exchanges to increase the number of staff it employs over the year while its peers such as Kraken and Coinbase have been forced to lay off staff during the current crypto winter.\n\nRelated: Tribulations and triumphs: The biggest surprises in crypto of 2022\n\nLooking ahead to 2023, Arcane predicted in a Dec. 30 report that Binance would implement trading fees again in 2023 which would lead to a \u201cnormalization of the market dominance.\u201d\n\nAs noted in a Jan. 3 report from digital asset data firm CryptoCompare, removing fees allows exchanges to attract customers but they \u201cmust be wary to remain profitable\u201d and \u201ccannot employ this strategy for long periods of time without hurting their bottom line.\u201d\n\nBinance could also be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny in 2023 \u2014 particularly relating to its native token BNB (BNB) \u2014 as following the fallout of the FTX empire, there has been an increased focus on crypto regulations globally.\n\nAnalysis from Bitcoin advocate Nic Carter suggested while Binance\u2019s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has been vocal about his support for exchanges providing proof-of-reserves (PoR), the PoR provided by Binance was incomplete as \u201cit only covers Bitcoin, which only represents 16.5% of their client assets.\u201d"

What is OKX P2P Marketplace, and how does it work?\n\nOKX P2P Marketplace is a platform that allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using various payment methods, including PIX. It operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, meaning buyers and sellers can directly trade without the need for a central authority.\n\n2. What is PIX, and how is it different from other payment methods?\n\nPIX is a real-time interbank payment system developed by the Brazilian Central Bank that allows instant and secure financial transactions between individuals and businesses. It is a relatively new payment method in Brazil, but it has already gained significant adoption and is expected to become the primary payment system in the country. One of the main benefits of PIX is that it allows for faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional methods such as bank transfers.\n\n3. Can I buy Bitcoin (BTC) anonymously with PIX on OKX P2P Marketplace?\n\nWhile it is possible to buy Bitcoin (BTC) anonymously on some platforms, OKX P2P Marketplace requires users to undergo identity verification and link their PIX accounts to buy BTC with PIX. This is to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations and to protect against fraud. However, once you have completed the verification process, you can buy BTC with PIX on OKX P2P Marketplace without revealing your personal information to the seller.\n\n4. Is there a fee for buying Bitcoin with PIX on OKX?\n\nWhile OKX P2P Trading does not charge a fee for the purchase of Bitcoin, there may be fees associated with using PIX to complete the transaction on OKX. These could include fees charged by PIX for processing the payment. Therefore, it is essential to carefully review all fees before completing a transaction to ensure you are aware of the total cost.\n\n5. Is it safe to buy Bitcoin with PIX on OKX P2P Marketplace?\n\nOKX P2P Trading takes security seriously and employs several measures to protect its users, including KYC verification, secure authentication, encryption of sensitive data, and regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. It is recommended to only trade with users with a good reputation on the platform and to carefully review the terms of a trade before agreeing to it. While OKX takes steps to ensure the safety and security of its users, as with any online transaction, there are always risks involved. To protect yourself, only trade with reputable sellers and always use a secure payment method, such as PIX."

        "content": "The streak of bankruptcies and price declines has dampened glimmers of positive progress. But Bitcoin just turned 14 today. January 3 is known as Bitcoin Genesis Day for the first block of BTC ever mined by Satoshi way back in 2009, which paved the way for the cryptocurrency as we know it today.\n\nThe first block on the network hosts a single transaction \u2013 the 50 BTC block reward \u2013 sent to the pseudonymous creator(s) for mining it. The BTC mining rewards are yet to be touched.\n\nSince the creation of Satoshi\u2019s revolutionary monetary system and its intrinsic currency, a lot has changed.\n\n\u2018Chancellor on the Brink of Second Bailout for Banks\u2019\n\nThe Genesis block essentially reflects Satoshi\u2019s rejection of the centralized infrastructures of the current fiat system. The developer, instead, believed in decentralized pillars that were cryptographically secured in a mathematically verifiable digital system.\n\nClearly, the old system was failing, shaking people\u2019s faith in banks. Building a new one without all of the controls and perils meant that coincided with the climactic unraveling of the global economy was a major milestone.\n\nSatoshi did not stop there. Before mysteriously disappearing, they covertly coded into the genesis block with an \u201cEaster Egg.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\n\nThe above text is a headline for an article in the edition of The [London] Times about the British government\u2019s failure to stimulate the economy after the 2007-08 financial crisis. The message was clear. The creation of genesis block on the same day as news of an imminent bank bailout is certainly symbolic.\n\nBitcoin was designed to serve the exact purpose that financial institutions, which are considered too big to fail, failed to do. Unlike traditional banks, Bitcoin cannot be bailed out. There is no middleman, no third party, nor any sort of corporate entity to meddle between the asset and the consumer.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Consistent Popularity\n\nNo amount of doomsayers and mainstream media declaring Bitcoin dead can actually make the blockchain stop. The crypto-asset has experienced four major bull/bear cycles since its inception.\n\nMore than a decade later, Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency option, despite the creation of thousands.\n\nData from Nasdaq and Ycharts, as shared on Reddit this week, revealed that there is no dethroning the king coin any time soon. While Ethereum recorded more than fourfold with 408.5 million ETH transactions in 2022, Bitcoin still remains the most searched crypto. It even reported a steadier transaction volume in its network than its rival."

        "content": "Prevailing Crypto Winter Wipes Over 70,000 Bitcoin Millionaires During Entire 2022\n\nThe world of Bitcoin (BTC) has produced several millionaire success stories, as early adopters of the cryptocurrency have seen their investments pay off significantly. However, the recent volatility experienced by Bitcoin has resulted in millionaire holders suffering significant losses.\n\nIn particular, according to data acquired and calculated by Finbold as of January 2, 2023, the number of Bitcoin millionaire addresses stood at 28,007, representing a drop of about 71.73% or 71,085 addresses from January 2, 2022. At the start of last year, the number of millionaire addresses stood at 99,092.\n\nElsewhere, in January 2022, the number of addresses holding $1 million worth of Bitcoin stood at 90,902 to record, a year-over-year (YoY) drop of 73.33% to 24,208 in the first month of 2023. At the same time, addresses with at least $10 million worth of Bitcoin stood at 8,190 in January 2022 before plunging by 62.5% to 3,799 in January 2023.\n\nNotably, most Bitcoin addresses hold between $100 and $999 worth of BTC at 13.47 million as of January 2023, representing a drop of about 13.33% YoY from 15.63 million. The second largest group of Bitcoin holders accounts for at least $1,000 worth of BTC at 5.33 million as of January 2023, while in 2022, the figure stood at 6.54 million.\n\nBear market wipes out Bitcoin millionaires\n\nThe research report identified some of the contributing factors to the drop in the number of Bitcoin millionaire holders. According to the research report:\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to fall, many investors have seen their holdings significantly devalue. Therefore, the drop in millionaire addresses highlights how far the crypto market has fallen from the 2021 bull run. The slump correlates with the asset's volatility which has been a highlight of 2022, plagued by a combination of several factors such as regulatory scrutiny, turbulent markets, macroeconomic factors, and fraud-related incidents like the FTX crypto exchange crash and the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem crash.\u201d\n\nIndeed, commentators believe Bitcoin can recover as the crypto market undergoes an extended phase of volatility. At the same time, there is skepticism that the market will reclaim the previous highs.\n\nRead the full story with statistics here: https://finbold.com/bitcoin-millionaires-2022/"

        "title": "Will This 'Gap' Pull Bitcoin Down To $9.6k In 2023? - Watcher Guru",
        "content": "The past month has been quite monotonous for Bitcoin. The largest crypto asset has mostly remained sandwiched in the narrow $1000 range between $16.3k-$17.3k in the said period.\n\nHowever, traders have gradually started stepping back into Bitcoin\u2019s arena. A recent report from Arcane Research pointed out that the CME open interest climbed towards the end of last year. As shown below, CME\u2019s OI surged above 80,000 BTC in December 2022. Yet, it has not left behind any directional cues. Pointing out why, the report noted,\n\n\u201c\u2026 the growth has been accompanied by a flat futures basis. Thus, it is challenging to infer any directional information related to the recent increase in active institutional participation.\u201c\n\nCME Gap Dictates Bitcoin\u2019s Movement\n\nThe CME gap is quite an interesting trading notion. Technically speaking, it is the difference in the futures contracts\u2019 trading price of the new week\u2019s open when compared to the previous week\u2019s close.\n\nThe CME market, on its part, is not open all the time\u201424/7*365\u2014like the spot crypto market. It follows the usual exchange working hours and also closes on holidays. As a result, the formation of gaps on its chart is not very uncommon.\n\nOn December 31, 2022, Bitcoin CME futures closed at $16.52k. Post the New Year break, it opened at $16.66k, and as a result, a gap was formed. On most occasions in the past, CME gaps have been bridged within a few days. Having said that, it should also be noted that there remains a few unfilled gaps from the previous decade as well.\n\nAs shown below, the latest gap was filled a few hours back by Bitcoin. Right after closing the gap, the asset reversed its course and started making upward strides. At press time, BTC was trading at $16.845k on CME.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nWhat Next?\n\nDespite the recovery initiated, many from the space feel that the asset\u2019s price has not yet bottomed out. At this juncture, it is interesting to note that Bitcoin has an unfilled gap of around $9.6k-$9.7k from 2020. As a result, there are high odds of the price falling down to this level to do the unfinished job of closing the gap before heading higher.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nA recent Twitter poll conducted by analyst Benjamin Cowen pointed out that the community majorly expects the asset to bottom in the $10k-$15-k bracket. Of the 17.7k votes received until press time, more than 53% of them chose the said option. The rest remained divided. Even so, respondents were positive that the said CME gap will be filled by Bitcoin.\n\nEveryone knows that BTC is gonna fill that CME gap at 9k \ud83e\udd21 \u2014 Figure it out! (@I9aVicI_7a5) January 4, 2023\n\nAnother scenario that could later pan out during the year is the asset heading to $28k and $36k to eventually fill other gaps created last year. Either of the said level could perhaps be the high for 2023.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nTechnical and Fundamental Analyst \u2018Mikybull\u2019 is on the same page and expects something similar to materialize this year."

        "content": "On January 3, 2009, the anonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, launched the Genesis Block \u2013 the first block in the Bitcoin Blockchain. The event at the time wasn\u2019t celebrated \u2013 it was arguably considered a blip in the long history of cryptography and digital currency \u2013 but today we know the Genesis Block was one of the most important things to happen in the history of cryptocurrency.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what the Genesis Block was and why it was important \u2013 even vital \u2013 to the growth of cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is a genesis block?\n\nA blockchain ledger can be thought of as a digital chain of boxes, where each box contains a set amount of data. Part of that data includes a reference to the previous block, which, in turn, contains information about the block before it and so on. This data can be followed all the way back to a blockchain\u2019s very first block \u2014 known as the genesis block.\n\nA genesis block lays the foundation for a new blockchain and possesses a number of unique traits that no other block in its chain has.\n\nWith regards to bitcoin\u2019s genesis block, its creation marked the beginning of a new financial revolution and ushered in the era of decentralized digital money.\n\nWhat\u2019s special about a genesis block?\n\nWhen a new blockchain is created, it\u2019s important that all network participants \u2014 known as nodes \u2014 acknowledge the same block as being the genesis block and synchronize from the same point. To ensure this, genesis blocks are directly embedded into their respective protocol\u2019s source code. No other block is permanently recorded in this way.\n\nGenesis blocks are also the only blocks that do not reference a previous block of transactions. For all other blocks, they contain a hash value of the previous block. In the case of genesis blocks, this value is always zero.\n\nCrypto tokens such as Tether, Chainlink and Uniswap do not have genesis blocks. This is because, unlike crypto coins, crypto tokens are built on top of a non-native blockchain like Ethereum, Solana or Binance Smart Chain.\n\nThe bitcoin genesis block\n\nThe bitcoin genesis block is famous for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it\u2019s hailed as being the first cryptocurrency block ever created on a globally viable, proof-of-work powered blockchain. This landmark moment paved the way for the creation of the disruptive digital asset industry we have today.\n\nThat being said though, just like its mysterious creator(s), bitcoin\u2019s early beginnings are also deeply shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the original Bitcoin source code distributed in 2008, Bitcoin\u2019s creator(s) Satoshi Nakamoto referenced the hash of the bitcoin genesis block as being,\n\n\n\n\u201c0x000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\u201d\n\nCryptographer Ray Dillinger, a.k.a Cryddit, was one of the first to receive the original Bitcoin source code. They noted the genesis block hash in the early source code was different to the bitcoin genesis block hash produced when Nakamoto launched the protocol on Jan. 3, 2009 \u2014several months later.\n\nThe subsequent bitcoin genesis block hash turned out to be:\n\n000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f\n\nThe two values are almost identical, apart from the second character. Some have suggested this might point to an earlier bitcoin blockchain that Nakamoto may have created for \u201ctesting purposes\u201d but never continued. However, like Nakamoto\u2019s true identity, the existence of this potentially earlier bitcoin blockchain remains unclear.\n\nHow much BTC was minted in the bitcoin genesis block?\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto mined the official bitcoin genesis block in 2009, 50 BTC were created for the first time and sent to the wallet address: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.\n\nTo this day, those first coins have never been moved from that wallet, though the address has received a further 18.5 BTC from more than 3,600 wallets. These payments may be tributary contributions from loyal bitcoin supporters or simply accidental transactions. These transactions might be considered digital graffiti \u2013 a sort of \u201cI was here\u201d made by bitcoin adherents.\n\nAfter the genesis block was created, it took a further six days before Nakamoto mined the second bitcoin block. Again, it\u2019s not known why it took so long for the second block to be mined, but some believe it was a nod to the Bible\u2019s seven days of creation.\n\nWho owns the first bitcoin block reward?\n\nWhen a new block is mined, the first transaction recorded in that block is known as a coinbase transaction. This references the new amount of native cryptocurrency that gets created after the mining process and released into circulation as a block reward.\n\nThe coinbase transaction of the bitcoin genesis block, however, was omitted from the global transaction database by Nakamoto, meaning that the amount could never be spent. It\u2019s still unknown whether this was intentional or accidental on Nakamoto\u2019s part.\n\nDespite the vast amount of uncertainty surrounding bitcoin\u2019s genesis block, its creation remains one of the most important moments in history, not just for cryptography but for global financial freedom and self-sovereignty.\n\nThese materials are for general information purposes only and are not investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell, or hold any digital asset or to engage in any specific trading strategy.

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s oldest and largest cryptocurrency, turned 14 yesterday. That\u2019s right, on Jan 3, 2009, the pseudonymous creator of the Bitcoin network, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the first block of BTC transactions.\n\nFor obvious reasons, this block was named the Genesis Block. And just like BTC miners today, Nakamoto received a reward for the computation power he dedicated towards verifying the transactions that made up the Genesis Block. At the time, this reward was 50 BTC.\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin enthusiasts have found numerous ways to celebrate the creation of the Genesis Block. For instance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, took to Twitter to pay tribute to Nakamoto for his revolutionary creation.\n\n\u201cBitcoin turns 14. On this day fourteen years ago, the first #Bitcoin block was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. Thank you, Satoshi,\u201d said Binance in a tweet that was accompanied with a screen grab of the Genesis Block, as seen on the Bitcoin Block Explorer.\n\nAnd Binance was not alone, several investors and traders also used the microblogging website to convey their birthday wishes and tip their hat to the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. However, some die-hard enthusiasts (see: Bitcoin Maximalists) took their celebrations a step further by following one of the oldest Genesis Day traditions - sending BTC to the genesis block.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, when Nakamoto created the Genesis Block, he received 50 BTC as a mining reward. This reward was sent to a wallet - 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t moved since. However, Bitcoin enthusiasts have been sending small amount of BTC to this wallet address to celebrate the creation of the Genesis Block.\n\nIn fact, the wallet address now contains 68.56 BTC, according to data from the Bitcoin Blockchain Explorer. The 18+ additional BTC in the wallet can be attributed to enthusiasts transferring small amounts of bitcoin every now and then, including on the king cryptocurrency\u2019s birthday. This year, the highest amount sent into the wallet was 0.00210000 BTC, which is worth around $35.\n\nIn all, the BTC in the wallet is worth $1.15 million at current prices. If you rewind the clock to Nov 11, when BTC was changing hands at around $67K, the wallet\u2019s holdings would be worth a whopping $4.5 million.\n\nAnother important point to keep in mind is that the BTC stored in this wallet address cannot be spent, at least until Satoshi Nakamoto becomes active again and somehow has the keys to this 14-year-old wallet. Until then, any funds sent to the address cannot be retrieved. Therefore, sending BTC to the Genesis Wallet is a really selfless way of celebrating Bitcoin\u2019s birthday.\n\nFrom being valued at a few cents, to commanding a $67,000 valuation in Nov 2021, Bitcoin has come a long way since its inception. It\u2019s a journey that is truly worth celebrating and next year, you could join the party and send over a few satoshis to the Genesis wallet as a tribute to the world\u2019s oldest cryptocurrency."

        "content": "People across the world are celebrating the birthday of Bitcoin. Today, Bitcoin officially turns 14 years old. What is a Bitcoin Birthday and who\u2019s celebrating it? In this article, we go over a quick brief on Bitcoin and its start which marks a Bitcoin Birthday.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBy now, everyone is aware of Bitcoin. However, it\u2019s critical to draw attention to Bitcoin\u2019s key features. Decentralization is the core concept of Bitcoin, which enables peer-to-peer transactions without the use of middlemen like banks. This indicates that transactions can be carried out directly between users without the assistance of a third party for verification or facilitation.\n\nIn a world where privacy is a growing concern, Bitcoin is able to return privacy controls over to consumers.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Birthday?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) celebrated its 14th birthday on January 3rd, 2023. Bitcoin was created on January 3, 2009, when the genesis block was generated.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Genesis Block?\n\nThe first block ever mined for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is known as a \u201cGenesis Block.\u201d A blockchain is made up of several so-called blocks used to store data on transactions that take place on a blockchain network. Each block has a distinct header, and the block header hash is used to uniquely identify each such block.\n\nWho celebrated the Bitcoin Birthday?\n\nNaturally, Bitcoin hodlers and admirers wished Bitcoin a happy birthday. Crypto companies and exchanges also announced their Bitcoin wishes, as they wished for a long-term growth.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/princesolee1/status/1610279684679294982\n\nhttps://twitter.com/binance/status/1610266061638717442\n\nWhere will Bitcoin reach in 2023?\n\nIf Bitcoin continues to crash towards the low of around 12K, Bitcoin might reverse from that price higher. Looking back at how Bitcoin recovered, we can see that BTC prices jumped from $10,000 to $60,000 within 6 months. This assumption suggests that Q3 of 2023 should confirm the end of the downtrend and open a renewed bull crypto market. By then, Bitcoin can at least reach around 70% of its previous ATH.\n\nOffer from CryptoTicker\n\nAre you looking for a chart analysis tool that doesn\u2019t distract you with community messages and other noise?

        "content": "Bitcoin undoubtedly continues to be and will continue to be, for the rest of its history, the greatest exponent of the cryptocurrency industry worldwide. This is mainly due to the fact that it is the most representative cryptocurrency of all, and the one that has been best managed since the beginning of its history. Its rules are clear, its code, although open, is very secure, and it is the only truly untraceable cryptocurrency. Despite this, it does not escape the big problems that the cryptocurrency market has been having recently.\n\nThis has caused numerous users to keep their Satoshi under lock and key, and others, fearful of the crisis, get rid of them, lowering the price. Especially in recent months, when several scandals that, although not directly related to Bitcoin, have affected it in terms of value. In fact, it is not until now, in mid-December 2022, that Bitcoin has managed to slightly recover from this huge crash. Despite this, for a long time there were massive shorts against Bitcoin and various cryptocurrencies, which could have contributed to pushing the price of Bitcoin down. Many of these operations have been closing in recent weeks, so the price of Bitcoin has managed to stabilize. But why does this happen?\n\nIs crypto shorting good or bad?\n\nLike virtually all things in trading, shorting crypto is neither good nor bad, in fact, it is just a way to profit from an asset that is falling in value. And it is that, in general, the most lucrative operations are the so-called \u201clong\u201d operations, which are nothing more than operating in favor of an asset that you think is going to rise.\n\nWhen you go short, you are trading against an asset that you think is going to go down. Here, if you are interested in, you can find a shorting crypto guide with different strategies you can use. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies had a long bearish period with a lot of volatility that made many investors prefer to trade this way. This, being so massive, could have caused Bitcoin to drop in price more than necessary. With those short trades being liquidated, it is very likely that Bitcoin will begin a slow recovery. In fact, it has recently recovered a modest rise that has made many looks at this cryptocurrency again. Away from the scandals that have shaken the crypto market, Bitcoin still has many holders who, throughout the unfavorable period, have not sold their Satoshi.\n\nWill cryptocurrencies hit rock bottom?\n\nMany believe that the cryptocurrency floor was already reached during the month of November, but many experts are of the opinion that, in fact, the price of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, will actually bottom out during the first quarter of 2023. It is possible that, When the New Year\u2019s hangover begins in the markets, Bitcoin could go down again, and shorting operations will once again swarm against Bitcoin and against other cryptocurrencies, precisely because there will be those who want to take advantage of this drop. Bitcoin will eventually recover, but for a true lasting uptrend to be reached there really isn\u2019t a period that analysts can predict with certainty, although there is a potential bottom that many expect to hit in the early months of 2023.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Learn More\n\nThe Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) price currently stands at US$16,699 (AU$24,454).\n\nThat's right about where BTC kicked off the new year three days ago.\n\nBut it's some 65% lower than the US$47,170 the world's first and still top crypto commanded on 1 January 2022.\n\nAdding in the selling action in the final seven weeks of 2021, the Bitcoin price closed 2022 down 76% from its all-time 10 November 2021 highs, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nHere's what went wrong for the leading digital token in the year gone by.\n\nBitcoin price hit by multiple headwinds\n\nOn a macroeconomic level, the Bitcoin price was hammered by the same forces which saw tech shares take a beating last year.\n\nNamely, fast-rising interest rates instituted by almost every leading central bank the world over.\n\nThe rapid increase in the cost of money saw the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index finish the year down a painful 34%. Here on the ASX, the S&P/ASX All Technology Index (ASX: XTX) fell a similar amount.\n\nIf nothing else, 2022 showed that the Bitcoin price is closely linked to the performance of growth stocks. And highly susceptible to the impacts of rising interest rates.\n\nThe crypto world was also rocked by a number of massive meltdowns in 2022.\n\nFirst, there was the implosion of TerraUSD (CRYPTO: UST) in May. The so-called stablecoin was intended to be pegged to the US dollar. But a liquidity crunch saw crypto investors rush to sell their holdings, driving the token to mere pennies on the dollar.\n\nJittery investors sold off most cryptos over the following weeks, and the Bitcoin price was not spared.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, November saw the collapse of global crypto exchange FTX.com.\n\nCo-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX was one of the top five crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nBut in another instance of liquidity evaporating, FTX went belly up almost overnight and Bankman-Fried is now facing a potentially lengthy jail term in the United States.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the FTX collapse, the Bitcoin price fell to more than two-year lows of US$15,599.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAs for what crypto investors might expect in the year ahead for the Bitcoin price, much of that will hinge on interest rates.\n\nShould the US Federal Reserve and other leading global central banks begin to ease off on their aggressive tightening paths, it should throw up some welcome tailwinds for tech stocks and crypto assets alike."

        "content": "On the sidelines of the Africa Bitcoin Conference in Accra Ghana early December 2022, Gridless, an East African based bitcoin mining company helping to bring new energy generation to rural communities in Africa announced a $2 million seed investment round led by Stillmark and Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block, Inc. The company said the investment will support the further expansion of bitcoin mines across African markets.\n\nWe sat down with Gridless Co-founder and CEO Erik Hersman to talk about the startup\u2019s expansion plans in 2023, opportunities for energy producers when it comes to Bitcoin mining as well as the state of crypto regulation in Kenya.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor context, Erik Hersman is a pioneer tech entrepreneur in Africa having cofounded leading companies such as Ushahidi, iHub; Nairobi\u2019s tech innovation hub and BRCK, a \u2018backup generator for the internet\u2019\n\nErik Hersman\u2019s new company, Gridless, designs, builds, and operates bitcoin mining sites alongside small-scale renewable energy producers in rural Africa where excess energy is not utilized. Gridless serves as the anchor tenant, financing the construction and managing the operation of data centers in rural communities where traditional industrial or commercial customers are not available.\n\nBitcoin mining requires high-powered computer processors in order to solve advanced mathematical equations. This process helps maintain the cryptocurrency\u2019s digital ledger, known as the blockchain. When these math problems are solved, Bitcoin miners receive the cryptocurrency in exchange.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in Africa is that the grids are not very well connected, and often times, the grid isn\u2019t close to communities that need energy. So you have this two part problem one is that these communities need power and the second problem is that anyone who wants to build a mini-grid in that community will need financing for that.\n\n\u201cSo they can\u2019t find financing easily because it takes anywhere from two to five years to find financing or even once they get the financing, the ability to build it, the community uptake of electricity is somewhat slow and this can take another five to ten years to have full capacity. So if we want to accelerate the electric electrification of the African communities, Bitcoin Mining provides this amazing, industrial off taker of power\u201d says Erik Hersman.\n\nThis essentially means that any of the energy that\u2019s not being used by the community is used for Bitcoin mining and that gives the reason to the energy developer to build it because they know there will be income.\n\nHersman says that people build these mini grids and hope the community will come online and they do. But they come on very slowly so they don\u2019t make enough money. And then they have to charge a very high price.\n\n\u201cSo when we come in, we take all that extra energy that nobody\u2019s buying in the community and we buy it and then admitted it can decrease the price for that community that was around.\u201d\n\nPowering a rural Kenya village and securing the #Bitcoin network with excess hydropower, all while lowering rates to 2000 people (500 families, ~$10/month to $4). ?? @GridlessCompute pic.twitter.com/9GUlAU6265 \u2014 jack (@jack) December 9, 2022\n\nKenya\u2019s leading power producer KenGen in 2022 announced plans to sell excess geothermal power to bitcoin miners as it seeks to diversify its revenues while reducing risks.\n\nErik welcomes the move by KenGen to allow Bitcoin Miners to set up and use excess energy for Bitcoin mining and compares this to Texas, home to the largest Bitcoin mining sites in North America, and fast achieving status as the undisputed Bitcoin mining capital of the world.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t do the same thing in any country in Africa, whether it\u2019s Kenya or Uganda or Ethiopia because all of them have excess energy. But not all of them have very good grids either\u201d says Hersman.\n\nGridless Plans in 2023\n\nTwitter Cofounder Jack Dorsey\u2019s company Block, Inc led Gridless $2 million seed investment and the company wants to use the capital to expand in East Africa, West Africa and Southern Africa.\n\nAs part of the company\u2019s expansion plans in Africa, the firm is looking for stranded energy. Meaning, energy that\u2019s going to waste already coming from renewable sources, primarily Hydro, but also solar and wind.\n\nGridless believes bitcoin mining can play a pivotal role as a buyer of first and last resort in creating more sustainable energy production and increasing electrification for local communities in the region.\n\nGreen Africa Mining Alliance\n\nAt the same time, Gridless is part of Green Africa Mining Alliance (GAMA), a community of people and organizations that want to grow Bitcoin mining in Africa and help each other. Other members of GAMA include Trojan mining from Nigeria, QRB labs from Ethiopia, Big Block data center in Congo and Sukuma Ventures from Kenya.\n\nGiven that there is little mining going in Africa, part of GAMA\u2019s goal is get more Bitcoin mining happening on the continent. This does not only secure the bitcoin network but also ensures the reduction in centralization of Bitcoin mining in North America and Europe hence further distribution across the world and Africa.\n\nBitcoin Regulation in Kenya\n\nKenya\u2019s Central Bank has recently softened its stance on cryptocurrency and recommended the formation of a technical committee that will create laws to regulate digital assets and businesses in the sector.\n\nSpeaking on this move amid the collapse of companies like FTX, Hersman says;\n\n\u201cIf you want to be a part of the future, you need to open up the regulation to bitcoin and maybe even crypto more generally exchanges and everything. So that it happens there because if you don\u2019t do that, then you won\u2019t have a piece of the future, that will go to the other countries that open things up, borders don\u2019t matter in our world.\u201d\n\nErik argues that Kenya needs to treat Bitcoin differently than crypto. He says Bitcoin needs to be seen as a commodity managed by the Capital Markets Authority. On the other hand, other cryptocurrencies should managed by the Central Bank.\n\nREAD;\n\nKenya Creating Legal Framework for Crypto Regulation \u2013 Central Bank\n\nJack Dorsey\u2019s Block Inc Leads $2 Million Investment in Kenya Based Bitcoin Mining Company Gridless"

        "content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) encountered one of the most challenging moments in 2022, data indicates that the BTC blockchain still accounted for a significant number of transactions.\n\nDespite the depressed prices, a staggering $8.2 trillion was transferred via the Bitcoin blockchain over the past year. The figure works out to an average of $260,000 per second, data estimates by crypto analysis firm CoinMetrics indicate.\n\nBitcoin blockchain transaction chart for 2022. Source: CoinMetrics\n\nImplication of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain transactions\n\nThe magnitude of the transaction amid the bear market highlights Bitcoin\u2019s possible increased adoption and its role in the general financial system. From the data, the number of transactions on the blockchain plunged significantly in the second half of the year in correlation with the asset\u2019s price movement.\n\nWith Bitcoin undergoing a freefall for the better part of 2022, the number one digital asset by market cap underwent a relief rally in early November after getting a boost from positive macroeconomic factors. However, the rally appears to have had a minimal impact on the number of transactions.\n\nThe transaction volume can also be welcomed by Bitcoin proponents, who might view the data as a sign of the asset\u2019s maturity to earn an integration into the mainstream financial sector. Interestingly, the extended bear market has resulted in skeptics suggesting that Bitcoin is likely to plunge to zero.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin operated in an environment of investor skepticism, with the asset hampered by factors such as rising inflation and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin still facing uncertainty\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin has taken a hit from the FTX crypto exchange collapse, whose effects are projected to spread into 2023. The impact of the price correction also resulted in Bitcoin millionaires plunging by over 70% in 2022, per a Finbold report.\n\nAdditionally, the price correction might extend further, considering Bitcoin is still operating in an environment of high inflation with uncertainty regarding the Federal Reserve monetary policy.\n\nIndeed, if the market records a rally, the amount transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain will likely increase.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $16,844, having made minor gains of less than 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, BTC was up over 1%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAs things stand, the flagship cryptocurrency also controls a market capitalization of about $324.37 billion. As economic uncertainty prevails, projections indicate that Bitcoin will likely undergo an extended price correction in 2023.\n\nIn particular, the machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions indicates that the asset might trade at $15,532 on January 31, 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Core Scientific to shut down 37,000 mining rigs it hosted for Celsius effective Jan. 3.\n\nThe two bankrupt firms have been in a legal battle for breach of contract since October 2022.\n\nCore Scientific, one of the biggest publicly traded cryptocurrency mining companies in the United States, is shutting down a large number of mining rigs as it undergoes bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nAccording to a court filing, the blockchain infrastructure company will shut off more than 37,000 mining rigs. The rigs are those it was hosting for the now-bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius Network.\n\nCore Scientific stated back in October that Celsius\u2019 non-payment of its power bill was causing it major liquidity issues. At the time, Core Scientific claimed that it was losing approximately $53,000 per day to cover the increased electricity tariffs that Celsius refused to pay.\n\nThe latest filing comes after Core Scientific\u2019s Dec. 28 motion seeking approval to reject Celsius\u2019 contract was approved. In the motion, Core claimed that Celsius\u2019 failure to pay its power bills constituted a material breach of contract. It also added that covering Celsius\u2019 mining rigs\u2019 power fee had cost it almost $7.8 million.\n\nThe latest filing reveals that the termination of Core Scientific\u2019s contract with Celsius will help the miner generate more revenue. It estimates that it can earn up to $2 million per month from the space currently occupied by Celsius\u2019 mining rigs.\n\nCourt has granted Core Scientific approval to power down all Celsius\u2019 mining rigs effective Jan. 3, 2023. It also stipulates a 75-day period from the date in which Celsius\u2019 is to pick up its mining equipment. And a 30-day period from the date of the order in which Celsius can file any claims relating to damages.\n\nCrypto winter eating into miners\u2019 revenues.\n\nCore Scientific\u2019s financial troubles are not only tied to Celsius\u2019 Terra-implosion-related bankruptcy according to a Reuters report. The crypto miner stated in its Dec. 21, 2022 bankruptcy filing that rising energy costs and the crypto market winter also played roles in its financial constraint.\n\nCore Scientific has also seen the price of its shares plunge 99.28 percent in the last year. It currently trades around $0.074, down from over $10 traded a year ago.\n\nHowever, it intends to continue operating while it reaches deals with its investors. Investment bank BlackRock, Core Scientific\u2019s largest shareholder, has already shown confidence in the firm\u2019s plans. According to an SEC filing, BlackRock has given Core Scientific a new $17 million loan.\n\nRemarkably, 2022 saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) plunge from about $45,000 to its current price range of around $16,000. The Russia-Ukraine war also caused energy prices to rise rapidly.\n\nThe market conditions have also affected the revenues of other mining firms. Similar to Core, Iris Energy and Riot Blockchain saw their share prices fall 91.79 percent and 85.09 percent respectively in the last year. Riot said in a recent statement that it had failed to reach its BTC mining target despite expanding its hashrate.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.
