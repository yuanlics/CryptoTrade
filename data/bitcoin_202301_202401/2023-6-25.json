        "title": "Lost Passwords Lock Millionaires Out of Their Bitcoin Fortunes (Published 2021) - The New York Times",
        "content": "Stefan Thomas, a German-born programmer living in San Francisco, has two guesses left to figure out a password that is worth, as of this week, about $220 million.\n\nThe password will let him unlock a small hard drive, known as an IronKey, which contains the private keys to a digital wallet that holds 7,002 Bitcoin. While the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply on Monday, it is still up more than 50 percent from just a month ago, when it passed its previous all-time high of around $20,000.\n\nThe problem is that Mr. Thomas years ago lost the paper where he wrote down the password for his IronKey, which gives users 10 guesses before it seizes up and encrypts its contents forever. He has since tried eight of his most commonly used password formulations \u2014 to no avail.\n\n\u201cI would just lay in bed and think about it,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cThen I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn\u2019t work, and I would be desperate again.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin is up 12% this month \u2014 even though barely anybody is trading it - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nAndriy Onufriyenko | Moment | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin has rallied sharply this month \u2014 but not for reasons you might think. The world's largest digital currency has risen more than 12% since the beginning of June. On Wednesday, its price topped $30,000 to hit its highest level since April 14, according to Coin Metrics data. Market players have attributed the jump to the news that U.S. asset management giant BlackRock had filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund tracking the market price of the underlying asset. While that may be part of the reason, the outsized moved can be put down to another factor beyond the news flow surrounding large institutions taking steps to embrace bitcoin or other digital assets.\n\nThin liquidity and big players\n\nCrypto \"market depth\" has been sitting at very low levels this year. Market depth refers to a market's ability to absorb relatively large buy and sell orders. When market depth is low and big players put in orders to buy or sell digital coins, prices can move in a big way up or down, even if the orders are not that huge. Market depth is a measure of liquidity in a market. According to data firm Kaiko, bitcoin's market depth has fallen 20% since the start of this year. Bitcoin has been one of the hardest-hit cryptocurrencies in terms of market depth, Kaiko said.\n\nThe market depth of bitcoin at a 1% range from the mid price has fallen about 20% since the start of the year, according to data firm Kaiko. Kaiko\n\n\"Bitcoin's recent surge in value has largely been driven by large trades within a less liquid market,\" Jamie Sly, head of research at CCData, told CNBC via email. \"Our analysis of market orders over 5 BTC reveals an aggressive surge in market buying, suggesting large players are seeking to gain exposure to digital assets.\" \"When combining large orders with thin books, the market is subject to more volatile movements,\" Sly added. That lack of liquidity has in part been driven by the regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry from U.S. authorities. The Securities and Exchange Commission has sued major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. Low liquidity, which has been a feature of the crypto market all year, is also partly behind bitcoin's 80% year-to-date rally.\n\nRetail traders aren't back \u2014 yet\n\nAnother notable feature of the current crypto market is the low volumes being traded on exchanges. Daily trading volume in the cryptocurrency currently sits at around $24 billion, according to crypto data website CoinGecko.\n\nThat's down markedly from the more than $100 billion of overall trading volume in bitcoin during the peak of the 2021 crypto rally, when bitcoin rose close to an all-time high of nearly $69,000. Large crypto investors usually hope that an early surge in prices will be enough to tempt retail investors back into participating in the rally which ultimately boosts prices for bitcoin and other digital coins. But that hasn't happened. \"What is notable about this rally is that trade volumes overall are at multi-year lows, and we are only seeing a slight increase, which even then is far lower than levels we saw from January to March,\" Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, told CNBC. \"I think trading volumes and price volatility are two of the most telling indicators of crypto market activity. Both volatility and volumes are at multi-year lows, and even a rapid increase in price is not enough to draw traders in.\"\n\n'It's not a market for ordinary clients'\n\nIn the last bitcoin cycle, market momentum was largely driven by big, institutional names as investment banks from Morgan Stanley to Goldman Sachs set up trading desks to give their clients exposure to the digital currency. However, the market really started to break out only when retail traders started to take notice \u2014 in early 2021, people became tempted by the phenomenon that was NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and other more speculative bets. Later that year, the cryptocurrency market experienced a seismic rally, with the price of bitcoin zooming to unprecedented levels. That was in tandem with surging trading volume, which climbed from $21.2 billion at the start of 2020 to $105.4 billion on Nov. 9, 2021, when bitcoin hits its all-time high, according to CoinGecko. Today, trading volume is nowhere near where it was at the height of the 2021 crypto boom. \"Any bit of news, if it's good, then the professional traders trade \u2014 otherwise, they're not trading,\" Carol Alexander, a professor of finance at the University of Sussex, told CNBC. \"If a bit of good news like the bitcoin ETF comes, they fire the cannons upwards.\" BlackRock's ETF filing was followed by similar move from Invesco and WisdomTree, which also filed for their own respective bitcoin-related products.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Bitcoin and ether are both being manipulated in this way by the professional traders. They don't trade most of the time, they wait until there's a bit of good news,\" Alexander said. \"Then they'll sell the top and you've got a sideways market.\" Indeed, bitcoin has traded within a range this year, and attempts to burst significantly higher have been thwarted. Alexander thinks bitcoin is likely to trade within a range of between $25,000 and $30,000 for the remainder of the summer. She expects, however, that toward the end of the year, the cryptocurrency will climb toward $50,000, citing attempts from larger market players to prop up the market, with big purchases making outsized moves. \"It's not a market for ordinary clients. It's really is not,\" she warned.\n\nHas the market bottomed?\n\nVijay Ayyar, vice president of international markets at the Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX, told CNBC he suspects the latest run-up in bitcoin's price is being driven more by \"long term institutional buyers.\" Big funds and crypto-focused hedge funds are among the market participants driving the action, Ayyar added. \"I don't think this is as much of a retail push, since retail was quite flushed out during the recent pullback,\" he said. Several crypto industry insiders have expressed hopes that the market is nearing a \"bottoming\" period where it can start to rise again. The recent price action echoes activity in 2018, when both bitcoin's price and volumes were subdued for several months before beginning to rise again the following year. However, CCData's Sly said it is \"still too early to say whether the worst is over for bitcoin.\" \"The recent wave of interest from traditional financial institutions, like Blackrock, Citadel [Securities], and Fidelity instils a renewed optimism in the market,\" he said. \"Provided the wider macro environment and equity markets continue to be favorable, it is possible that bitcoin could maintain its current positive price trajectory.\" WATCH: Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king?\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "More than $3 million worth of Bitcoin just moved after 13 years of dormancy. Two wallets holding 50 BTC each, mined back in 2010, were moved to different wallets.\n\nIt is unclear who the owners of the cryptocurrency are but they are the sixth and seventh whales to have moved large quantities of BTC this year.\n\nThe movements come as the price of the largest digital asset soars following renewed institutional investor interest. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up nearly 15% in seven days, trading hands for $30,381, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe term \"whales\" refers to investors who hoard huge amounts of Bitcoin and don\u2019t touch it for years.\n\nSuch investors\u2014also known as \u201cHODLers\u201d\u2014are the most successful. Those who buy BTC and sell it quickly usually lose out, while those who buy it and sit on it for years tend to make a profit.\n\nThis is because Bitcoin experiences short-term volatility but in the long-term its price has appreciated massively. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap back in July 2010 was worth a fraction of a cent.\n\nDr. Kirill Kretov, a developer of tools for automated trading and blockchain analyst, previously told Decrypt that Bitcoin mined back in 2010 was probably down to computer experts experimenting with the technology but that it was hard to know whether the Bitcoin had since landed in the hands of commercial entities.\n\n\"There is this unique spirit of crypto anarchy and technological pioneering behind such elder addresses,\" Kretov told Decrypt. \"It's like a way-back machine, and thousands of people are left to speculate about why those bitcoins were transferred now.\"\n\nHe also mentioned that there's a theory that \"elder\" whale wallets shift BTC to send each other signals about when it's time to pump the price of the world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\"There are some researchers who take notes on price charts about those awakenings, trying to predict the future price,\" he said. \"Luckily, I'm not one of those.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOther whale movements include a holder in April who hadn\u2019t touched their coins for a decade shuffling $7.8 million-worth of BTC to new wallets.\n\nNumber of Bitcoin Whales Drops to Lowest Level Since 2019\n\nAnd just last week, a long-term investor moved 50 BTC after 11 years of inactivity to a new wallet."

        "content": "Forget caffeine, tobacco and any other stimulants the normies might be into. Nothing gets you going like the thrill of the shill. You\u2019re not a whale, but you aspire to be. Your free time is spent instigating fights with ETH maxis on Crypto Twitter and praying the bottom is in. You bleed bitcoin.\n\nAnd now you can level up your passion for the space and take a dip in water that, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is from the Fountain of Youth: Bath water warmed by the blood, sweat and tears of hard-working bitcoin miners.\n\nOh no, this is no joke. Bathhouse in Brooklyn (a bathhouse in Brooklyn) is keeping its pools nice and toasty thanks to its bitcoin mining operation.\n\nHeat is a byproduct of the computing power required to mine bitcoin. The spa uses heat exchangers to transfer the heat from their ASICs to the water, according to Bathhouse. As water cools, it is circulated back to the miners to be warmed up again. Recycling at its finest.\n\nThe spa shared details of its joint mining-heating operation on social media this week, and some of their patrons were less than enthused, calling the project \u201cunhinged,\u201d \u201coff-putting\u201d and \u201cso cringe.\u201d\n\nTo be frank, get rekt. It\u2019s bitcoin juice. If I lived in New York, I\u2019d buy the $55 day pass just to drink the stuff. It\u2019s just as silly to spend time worrying about these miners\u2019 environmental and financial impact as it is to heat your pools with bitcoin in the first place.\n\nBut heating pools in Brooklyn isn\u2019t the only way to make full use of your miners. Hey, I get it. Not everyone is a big public pool person. But the opportunities to maximize your miners\u2019 true potential are only limited by the scope of your creativity.\n\nWhite noise machine \u2014 Having trouble sleeping? Look no further than the trusty Antminer. The incessant squeaking from a nearby train yard has me tossing and turning all night. I could run a rig on my bedside table, right next to my casual bedtime read \u2014 War and Peace. The constant din would give me some of the deepest REM cycles of my life.\n\nI\u2019d also imagine that a miner will work wonders lulling your fussy infant to sleep. Added benefit: The mechanical vibes will be right at home in the ever-popular cyberpunk-themed nursery.\n\nYour favorite veggies, year round \u2014 Set up a few miners in your greenhouse, and the heat thrown by these suckers could take your little radishes to new heights. Your neighbors will start asking for your secret, and you can tell them the truth: \u201cA little satoshi here, a little bitcoin there.\u201d\n\nAir Bitcoin \u2014 You\u2019re reclined in first class, sipping on a glass of champagne. The plane engine, albeit loud, is moving you along at 500 miles an hour. You\u2019re pondering your in-flight movie options. Should you go with a classic? They do have your favorite, the 2004 smash hit Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2. The person assigned to the seat next to you never showed up, and you have all the legroom you could want.\n\nSomeone gently taps you on the shoulder, must be the flight attendant. You slide the silky face mask off of your eyes, and surprise! You\u2019re not going to Bali. You\u2019re in your living room, sitting in a lawn chair, clutching a sweating bottle of Miller Lite. The calming hum of the airplane you were enjoying just moments ago? Mining rigs, making your in-flight fantasies a reality.\n\nNo-no Ma \u2014 Tired of your neighbor kid practicing F\u00fcr Elise on the cello? Point a couple of miners in the right direction, and show that kid who\u2019s the real neighborhood noisemaker.\n\nA quick list, but talk about real-world use cases! I\u2019m starting to think you could use the heat to power an at-home foot spa. Frying an egg is a solid option, albeit uninspired. Maybe I\u2019ll try jumping rope with the extra long cables? Through bitcoin, all things are possible.\n\nHannah Finnerty is Blockworks\u2019 editorial operations manager and is based in the US.

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped but held above the US$30,000 threshold on Monday morning in Asia, with nearly all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies rising. The gains follow a number of traditional financial institutions showing interest in launching crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the U.S. securities regulator approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs in the country on Friday. In the NFT market, a whale has been selling off Bored Ape Yacht Clubs.\n\nBitcoin little changed\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.35% to US$30,444 over the last 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 15.44% in the past seven days.\n\nEther gained 1.18% to US$1,898, with a 10.32% weekly gain.\n\nPolkadot led gains among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies with a 3.28% 24-hour rise to post a weekly gain of 14.28%. Beside Bitcoin, Litecoin was the only token on the list edging lower, dropping 1.48% over the past 24 hours but up 14.24% for the week.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the nation\u2019s first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF offered by Florida-based Volatility Shares, CoinDesk reported. The \u201c2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF\u201d is set to start trading on June 27 on CBOE BZX Exchange, according to the fund\u2019s website.\n\nThe ETF will not invest directly in Bitcoin but seek to benefit from increases in the price of Bitcoin futures contracts for a single day, according to its prospectus. The fund will correspond to two times the return of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll index.\n\nThis comes after BlackRock and WisdomTree recently filed applications with the SEC to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. The regulator has given a greenlight to a number of futures-based crypto ETFs but has not approved spot products.\n\n\u201cThe turbulences of 2022 have led to a decline in confidence in crypto-native institutions, presenting traditional financial institutions with a prime opportunity to enter the crypto market,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast last week.\n\nAdditionally, New York-headquartered investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. launched euro-denominated transactions on its blockchain-based payment system, JPM Coin, Bloomberg reported on Friday.\n\nJPM Coin allows clients to transfer euros or dollars held with their JPMorgan accounts immediately and at any time of the day, unlike traditional banking transactions that usually operate during business hours.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club dump\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.25% to 2,905.28 in the 24 hours to 9:40 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index, however, is up 1.08% for the week.\n\nNFT transactions on Ethereum fell 2.49% over the past 24 hours to US$18.38 million, while transactions on the Bitcoin network surged 138% to US$3.6 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201cEthereum is still struggling with tumbling prices, especially in Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) whose average sales price remains in the low- to mid-US$70,000 range,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nOver the past few days, NFT whale Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi, has dumped dozens of his BAYC holdings. On Saturday, Machi sold 19 BAYC NFTs in one transaction on marketplace Blur for 651.56 Ether, or roughly US$1.22 million.\n\nThe floor price of BAYC stood at 37.4 Ether on Blur on Monday morning in Asia, gaining 4.18% over the past day but losing 13.52% over the past week.\n\nSales of BAYC jumped 26.11% over the past 24 hours to US$3.43 million, adding to weekly sales of US$13.11 million. BAYC was the most-sold collection for the past day and week in terms of transaction value.\n\nEthereum-based Azuki NFT transactions rose 25.68% in the past 24 hours to US$3.07 million, the highest after BAYC.\n\nAzuki\u2019s floor price on Blur rose 1.78% in the past day but was down 9.21% for the week.\n\nU.S. stock futures rise\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin. Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 10:40 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.19%, and S&P 500 futures added 0.24%. Nasdaq Futures rose 0.32%.\n\nEquity markets across Asia were mostly mixed with investors unsettled by events in Russia over the weekend when Wagner Group mercenaries marched toward Moscow in what appeared to be a rebellion against the military leadership.\n\nThe group later halted the advance, but it raised concern about instability in Russia as it may undermine the leadership of President Vladimir Putin. Oil prices rose on concern about supply disruptions from Russia, the world\u2019s third-largest producer of crude oil.\n\nIn macroeconomic developments, Japan\u2019s services producer price index rose 1.6% year-on-year in May, according to official data released Monday.\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s economy, despite being affected by factors such as past high commodity prices, has picked up as private consumption, for example, has increased moderately,\u201d the Bank of Japan said Monday in the summary of opinions of June 15-16 monetary policy meetings.\n\nOn U.S. inflation and interest rates, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank is in consensus on the need for more interest rate hikes this year.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, and a 28.1% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged at the next meeting on July 26.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

The move will expand local users\u2019 exposure to cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/vH0LieSVGw \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 26, 2023\n\nWu added in a tweet that some of the crypto ETFs listed in Hong Kong include the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF.\n\nThe news comes after the region\u2019s banking regulator earlier this month pressured several of the biggest banks in Hong Kong, including HSBC, to accept crypto exchanges as clients. In an April letter sent by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to the banks, the regulator said that due diligence should not create \u201can undue burden\u201d to accepting crypto clients, the Financial Times reported.\n\nHong Kong has recently warmed to crypto publicly, in contrast with the outwardly cold stance taken by leaders in mainland China. Earlier this month, Hong Kong instituted a licensing scheme for crypto exchanges and reinstated retail crypto trading for select cryptocurrencies.\n\nSome in the industry have speculated that Hong Kong\u2019s openness to crypto could eventually lead to a thaw in mainland China\u2019s cryptocurrency ban.\n\nMeanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing several applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF, including from the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock. The SEC has so far denied all such previous applications.\n\nCrypto industry players hailed the move on Monday. Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of crypto exchange Gemini, said in a tweet that the development was more evidence that Asia is overtaking the U.S. when it comes to crypto.\n\n\u201cHong Kong has just beat the USA to the punch on a bitcoin ETF\u2026and ether ETF,\u201d Winklevoss wrote.\n\nBitcoin and Ether on Monday morning were trading down, about 1%, near $30,300 and $1,800, respectively."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's reason to be optimistic about bitcoin, and the world's biggest crypto token could climb to over $200,000 in the next few years, Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee told CNBC on Monday.\n\nCommenting on Cathie Wood's hugely bullish outlook for the coin \u2014 the Ark Invest CEO holds a $1 million target for bitcoin \u2014 he said that her rationale isn't misguided.\n\n\"I think her idea of network value for bitcoin and scarcity still argues that, if this isn't an upcycle, her numbers are correct, you know, something in the $200,000-plus range,\" he said.\n\nHis valuation is also largely based on the recent regulatory crackdown that has swept through crypto markets and \"battle-tested\" the token.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission this month took legal action against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, asserting that the firms are offering unregistered securities to their customers and are operating illegally in the US.\n\nWhile the SEC's moves could be a headwind for many tokens, it'll actually be a boost for bitcoin. The crackdown has had a limited impact on the token's price, which already bottomed out at around $25,000, according to Lee.\n\nAt the same time, the uncertainty has opened the door for some bigger names on Wall Street to enter the market. That includes the likes of BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, which this month filed with the SEC for the creation of a bitcoin ETF.\n\n\"There's been sort of a stage exit stage left for a lot of players, but then we've replaced them with, you know, some of the traditional players that have a lot of credibility,\" Lee said. \"Like the Blackrock and the Citadels coming into bitcoin.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNews of the ETF sent the token rallying over 21% from June's low. The coin is trading at around $30,626 on Monday.\n\nBitcoin also benefits from being a risk-on asset, he added, and given the the gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, historic trends show that the token is set to keep climbing.\n\nOver all, the cryptocurrency has been on a gradual, though volatile, rise in 2023. It jumped considerably in the spring, as decentralized assets like bitcoin looked more appealing during the banking turmoil sparked by the fall of Silicon Valley Bank in March."

What those sites had in common was that they were also inspired by the design of Bitcoin.\n\nThe twin developments were part of a growing movement by technologists, investors and everyday users to replace some of the internet\u2019s fundamental building blocks in ways that would be harder for tech giants like Facebook and Google to control.\n\nTo do so, they are increasingly focused on new technological ideas introduced by Bitcoin, which was built atop an online network designed, at the most basic level, to decentralize power."

It is scheduled to launch on the Chicago Board Options BZX Exchange on 27 June, 2023.\n\nThe fund looks for investment returns that are equivalent to double the return of the CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index. Investors can purchase shares of an ETF, which bundles securities like equities and commodities, to receive exposure to those securities without actually owning them.\n\nThere are two main types of Bitcoin ETFs: Bitcoin futures and Bitcoin spot. BITX will be a leveraged ETF, using Bitcoin futures as leverage to amplify the returns of a benchmark index. The news was largely applauded by proponents of cryptocurrencies, but others wondered why a simple spot ETF launched before a 2X leveraged futures offering. The BITX fund was approved by the SEC as large traditional financial institutions look to enter the cryptocurrency market recently."

        "content": "Wall Street players are now backing crypto as institutional investors show support for bitcoin ETFs. Yahoo Finance crypto reporter David Hollerith checks out bitcoin's year-to-date performance and the outlook for bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Crypto prices lower today but momentum has been strong this year. And now some of the biggest names in finance are making new bets on cryptocurrencies adding competition and momentum to the space. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has more on that story. And David, nothing like a boost of confidence from Wall Street to get investors bullish on crypto again.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Akiko, the big finance player moves that we've seen in the last two weeks obviously started with BlackRock filing an ETF. We also saw ETX markets begin trading. And they're backed by Fidelity Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities. And that's a new crypto exchange that doesn't interact with individuals but serves more like a traditional exchange.\n\nAnd then we have Deutsche Bank also applying to custody crypto assets. And outside of BlackRock, a lot of these moves were previously telegraphed as far back as a year. But obviously, this came at a really good time, I guess you would say for the space, just given that a lot of this year so far the story has been regulatory enforcements in the US leading to lawsuits. And that's still a lot of what we're looking at to determine where things are going.\n\nRegulation, of course, in the US is a really big deal. But we've seen obviously-- the Bitcoin price has surged a lot and then the total crypto market cap has followed along with that. And we've seen even just higher inflows into Bitcoin associated exchange traded products. So there's a lot of enthusiasm about this. Most of it actually was previously reported but I think that it highlights-- it's a reminder that cryptocurrency hasn't gone away as much as it might seem sometimes.\n\nAnd we see earlier this month, in fact, the SEC filing charges against the two largest crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: And David, to that point, at least up until this point when you take into account the massive run that we've seen in the price of Bitcoin up what about 80% year to date. It hasn't yet had a massive impact but I guess you can make the argument that it's coming off a very depressed level after the implosion of FTX. But what do you think are the key things that investors need to watch for when they're trying to figure out where Bitcoin, where crypto is headed in the second half?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. Always a good question. I think it's fair to think about it this way, which is that regulation has really dominated cryptocurrency asset prices. Maybe Bitcoin the least but still Bitcoin has sagged on bad regulatory news. So regulation is still going to be a major focus. But as things get cleared up, at least I think with the BlackRock and ETX announcements, there's a signal that US businesses or financial institutions, I should say, are still interested in getting involved in the space.\n\nAnd I think that brushes aside some of it. That being said, from what I've heard from crypto hopefuls in Washington, it sounds like there are two bills that are getting ready to be voted on in the House in July. And I've heard optimistically that one of those two bills could be passed in the House by the end of the year. There's a lot less optimism for what could happen in the Senate.\n\nAnd then that being said, the most important lawsuit as far as the ETF goes is the Grayscale lawsuit. Grayscale is suing the SEC for not approving its spot Bitcoin ETF or approving a conversion of its existing product. So the verdict for that case comes out at the beginning of September, and that's going to be really important. And we don't have the exact information, we don't know, but it'd be hard to imagine that the SEC would even consider approving an ETF before that verdict is reached.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: I know you'll be following those developments closely, David Hollerith, thank you."

        "title": "What Does Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Mean for Crypto? - Morningstar",
        "content": "Bryan Armour: BlackRock (BLK) shocked the financial world when it filed for the iShares Bitcoin Trust on June 15, becoming the most prominent filer for a spot Bitcoin ETF after years of rejection of the strategy by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The surprised filing came on the heels of the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, making the timing in BlackRock's partnership with Coinbase and the filing even more odd.\n\nBlackrock Would Make Bitcoin Legitimate\n\nAs the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock would immediately give legitimacy to the Bitcoin market in need of it. Between the SEC's crackdown in high-fee, imperfect Bitcoin ETFs currently on the market, an iShares spot Bitcoin ETF would be a welcome facelift. Whether that means investors should buy this fund should it hit the market is another question. Bitcoin is highly volatile, and its future is uncertain. There's not a fundamental value to lean on for investors, so this consideration should outweigh all others, including fund structure. Aside from investment merit, it's worth understanding where a spot Bitcoin ETF would fit in with other offerings available in the U.S. Currently, the Bitcoin ETF market is composed of three types of funds \u2013 grantor trusts, futures-based ETFs, and Bitcoin-adjacent equity funds. A spot Bitcoin ETF like the one BlackRock is proposing would create a fourth bucket because it doesn't fit in the others.\n\nWho Are Blackrock's Competitors in the Bitcoin Space?\n\nCurrently, the largest Bitcoin offering in the U.S. is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, ticker GBTC. It operates more like a closed-end fund than an ETF, meaning investors have faced large premiums and discounts in its price versus NAV that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. The iShares Bitcoin Trust would have continuous offerings like other ETFs, meaning authorized participants would be able to create and redeem shares at NAV at any time. This would help keep the ETF's price in line with its NAV. Grayscale currently doesn't allow redemptions. So, investors' only option is to sell at the prevailing price, which is currently heavily discounted.\n\nHow Will Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Work?\n\nFutures-based Bitcoin ETFs do a better job of tracking Bitcoin's price, but they also introduce other differences from holding Bitcoin. First, the intention of these funds is to hold the front month futures contracts. But futures contracts expire. Each month, the portfolio managers must roll into the next month's futures contract, often at a slightly higher price. This creates an added cost for the fund that a spot Bitcoin ETF wouldn't incur. The exchange that lists Bitcoin futures, the CME, also imposes position limits to avoid any one firm from controlling too much of the market. Should that occur, as it did in 2021 when ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, ticker BITO, launched, the portfolio managers had to move further out on the futures curve by buying longer-dated futures contracts. A rule of thumb is the longer a futures contract has until expiration, the less closely it will track the asset spot market.\n\nIn terms of its ability to track the price of Bitcoin, a spot Bitcoin ETF like the one proposed by BlackRock would clearly be an upgrade over currently available options. It would likely also come with lower fees. Grayscale charges a 2% fee while BITO charges 95 basis points, and this is one cause for investors that's highly likely to improve should BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF come to market.\n\nWhy is Blackrock Filing a Bitcoin ETF Now?\n\nThe ultimate question is why now for BlackRock's filing? There have been over 30 past filings for spot Bitcoin ETFs, but this is BlackRock's first. Perhaps it could be due to the impending decision of Grayscale's lawsuit against the SEC about rejecting a spot Bitcoin ETF, or perhaps BlackRock thinks it has the right approach to surveillance to quell the SEC's concern over manipulation of the Bitcoin market. We will all stay tuned to find out.\n\nEditor's Note: This ETF will not be available for sale in the UK"

EDX Markets, an institutional-only exchange announced in September 2022, will offer trading in four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.

        "content": "Crypto advocate Davinci Jeremie expected to become a hero to his community after talking about Bitcoin (BTC) 10 years ago and why people should buy at least $1 worth of it, but things did not turn out as he expected.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Jeremie shared the story of how he found Bitcoin, what his community thought about it back then, and what he thinks would help onboard more people into Bitcoin.\n\nCrypto influencer Davinci Jeremie on a call with Cointelegraph reporter Ezra Reguerra. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccording to the crypto influencer, it all started over 10 years ago, when a member of his community told him about BTC and asked him to have a look at it. At first glance, Jeremie, who is also a software developer, believed that it was a scam given th the double-spending problem was \u201cconsidered to be not solvable.\u201d He explained:\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Okay, I'm gonna read the source code since I\u2019m a software developer and tell you how it\u2019s a big scam.\u2019 I read the source code, read the white paper and realized, oh no, this is not a scam.\u201d\n\nAfter determining that BTC may be the solution to a huge problem in the monetary system, he made what became a trending video, asking his community to purchase at least $1 worth of BTC. However, what happened was a bit different that what he expected. He expected his community to be grateful for the information he shared, but they did not respond the way he thought they would.\n\n\u201cOnce in a while, something comes along that makes poor people rich because they got it really, really cheap. This was one of them. I thought I was gonna be the hero to my community, but no, they thought I was crazy. They actually thought I was losing my mind,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Rising institutional interest is a \u2018bullish\u2019 sign for crypto: SEBA Bank exec\n\nWhile people may have missed out on the opportunity to buy BTC at that price, Jeremie believes it\u2019s not too late to get into crypto. According to the influencer, only 2% of the population currently holds Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). However, a problem is that people want to have an entire coin, according to Jeremie, who said:\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to have a whole Bitcoin. Nobody wants to go into a store and say, \u2018Can I get 1/100,000,000th of an apple?\u2019 They want the whole thing. So, although Bitcoin is divisible, the divisibility is part of its Achilles heel.\u201d\n\nThe developer suggested that it may be optimal to have a satoshi-based Bitcoin wallet that shows balances differently. The software developer believes showing people that \u201cfor a whole dollar, you could get a few hundred thousand Bitcoin satoshis\u201d could potentially attract more people. \u201cIt\u2019s not as appealing to have that decimal spaces than a whole Bitcoin,\u201d he added.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "content": "On the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s Macro Markets, analyst Marcel Pechman explores how Turkey\u2019s recent interest rate increase might attract hundreds of millions of new cryptocurrency investors, and how China\u2019s looming economic crisis could affect Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto globally.\n\nTurkey\u2019s central bank has increased the interest rate by 6.5% to 15% in a dramatic attempt to fight inflation. The move comes as the local currency, the lira, dropped by 80% against the United States dollar in five years.\n\nAccording to Pechman, whether the U.S. dollar holds its dominant position as a global reserve currency doesn\u2019t matter. Turkey and Argentina\u2019s 70% inflation in 2022 are perfect examples of how decentralized cryptocurrencies might be the sole lifeguard for hundreds of millions \u2014 if not billions \u2014 of people who cannot save and transact in foreign currencies.\n\nThe next part of the show discusses whether China\u2019s economic weakness impacts Bitcoin and how its central bank digital currency could increase demand for cryptocurrencies. Goldman Sachs economists reduced their estimates for Chinese gross domestic product growth to 5.4%, citing \u201cchallenges from the property market, pervasive pessimism among consumers and private entrepreneurs, and only moderate policy easing.\u201c\n\nPechman shows how the iShares MSCI China exchange-traded fund has been a better proxy for Bitcoin\u2019s price and explains the importance of the Chinese economy to global growth. Ultimately, for Pechman, if the Chinese stock market goes down, the odds are cryptocurrency prices will be pressured as well.\n\nLastly, Pechman presents a bullish case for cryptocurrency adoption during a recession \u2014 or lower growth, in China\u2019s case \u2014 including stimulus checks being used to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nMacro Markets runs exclusively on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, so make sure to like and subscribe today!"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin Cash surged, making up for any losses in the past 30 days\n\nThe surge attributes to a technological upgrade, and also to the increased interest of a close cousin\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Forks?\n\nBitcoin Cash, one of the few altcoins not contested by the SEC has seen a 24% surge in the past 24 hours. The surge is the highest the cryptocurrency has seen since January, making up for any losses incurred in the past month.\n\nA Comeback Story\n\nBitcoin Cash has gained attention on both the investor side and the developer side recently.\n\nBCH received a significant upgrade in the month of May that improved its viability as a payment solution while improving its security protocols.\n\nThe token stands out due to its payment-only application, focusing on the fulfillment of smart contracts.\n\nMore importantly, BCH is at the center of a pivotal point in the history of the crypto market. A sudden rush of crypto ETFs has been taking over the news for the past 48 hours.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset management company, has officially applied for a spot Bitcoin trading ETF that enables the company to establish an exchange to address the needs of its institutional clients.\n\nOn top of that, Charles Shwab, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Citadel Security backed the launch of EDX Markets, the industry\u2019s new crypto exchange that serves both retail and institutional clients.\n\nHowever, the important thing to note here is that these exchanges are planning on trading on SEC-approved cryptocurrencies, i.e., Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum.\n\nNaturally, that increases the interest in these specific coins. With the crypto world now racing to get its hands on Bitcoin, the first obvious alternative to keep in mind is Bitcoin Cash.\n\nSoft Fork Vs Hard Fork\n\nA quick history lesson: Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, effectively creating the first-ever blockchain. Nakamoto then wrote some rules onto Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, creating what is now known as the Genisis Block, the first block on the chain.\n\nBlocks are used to store information regarding a certain asset or a certain set of protected data.\n\nAs Bitcoin gained popularity, more and more users created blocks, hence creating a blockchain. However, As blocks increased, so did the difficulty to apply new rules to the blockchain.\n\nShould a user decide to apply new rules, that don\u2019t comply with preexisting rules, to the blockchain, it creates a fork, a new blockchain. That process is referred to as a hard fork.\n\nA soft fork is when a user on the blockchain applies new rules that comply with the existing set, effectively upgrading the blockchain along with all users involved in it.\n\nBitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin, created in 2017 when Bitcoin developers couldn\u2019t agree on the process to be adopted when facing issues that compromised the structure of the blockchain.\n\nMind you, Bitcoin Cash is neither the only nor the first Bitcoin fork. There was Bitcoin XT in 2015, which doesn\u2019t even exist anymore. There are also Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited which were created in 2016.\n\nBut, seemingly, Bitcoin Cash is the last fork standing among a sea of failed forks. And, now that the SEC affirms that Bitcoin cash is among the list of cryptocurrencies it does not see as securities, the 2017 fork seemingly has a bright future of increasing in both value and demand."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nObtaining SEC approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF could become a reality for BlackRock\n\nTo be part of this potential offering, one has to become BlackRock customer through iShares\n\nThe action follows the denial of many other ETF proposals, including those from WisdomTree, Grayscale, and VanEck\n\nThe largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, recently announced it plans to introduce a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in order to provide investors with proximate exposure to the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Coinbase Custody would serve as the custodian partner for BlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust. Prior to 2022, the company introduced a spot Bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the United States.\n\nWhat is Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nIt is important to define the main difference between spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin Futures ETFs.\n\nAlthough investors can currently invest in Bitcoin futures ETFs, the United States has not yet approved a spot Bitcoin ETF. A spot Bitcoin ETF is backed by real Bitcoin (BTC), whereas a Bitcoin futures ETF is backed by derivatives on the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe number of options available to American investors would increase with the addition of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIs This the Right Time for Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF has yet to be introduced in the United States because to opposition from the SEC. Currently, the SEC and Grayscale are engaged in a legal dispute over whether the company will be permitted to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Later this year, a decision on that matter is anticipated.\n\nOther businesses have submitted and then withdrawn applications to start spot Bitcoin funds. There might be an overabundance of those products on the market if the SEC caves.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently commented the legal fight between Grayscale and the SEC, which arose when the agency rejected the digital asset manager\u2019s proposal to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF, may also be the reason behind BlackRock move.\n\nThe alternative view is that BlackRock is preparing for a scenario in which the SEC loses the Grayscale case and suddenly opens the door to Bitcoin ETF since they are aware of this possibility. Balchunas asserted that BlackRock has a strong track record of obtaining Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\n\u201cFun fact: BlackRock\u2019s record of getting ETFs approved by the SEC is 575-1. That\u2019s another reason this is so big. They don\u2019t play around,\u201d he stated.\n\nIf they ever start trading, ETFs often take months to launch after an initial filing. According to Aisha Hunt , principal at asset management legal firm Kelley Hunt & Charles, the proposed BlackRock fund would probably encounter strong opposition from the SEC, and the filing could be withdrawn before an ETF is ever established.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s was already famous for pumping stocks and this decision was made at a time when cryptocurrency values are still well off their all-time highs, and the sector is coming under more and more scrutiny in Washington, D.C. The action follows the denial of many other ETF proposals, including those from WisdomTree and VanEck.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nPROS CONS Spot Bitcoin ETF \u00b7 Investors can access Bitcoin directly without needing to register with a cryptocurrency exchange or establish a wallet \u00b7 Diversification of the portfolio \u00b7 Regulation for investor protection. Investors in a spot Bitcoin ETF gain by investing in a regulated instrument issued by a licensed issuer rather than an uncontrolled off-market cryptocurrency exchange \u00b7 Traditional exchanges have trading hours that are limited, as opposed to cryptocurrency exchanges, which are open 24/7 \u00b7 Fees for managing ETFs Futures Bitcoin ETF \u00b7 Due to the simplicity of setup, lack of custody fees, and other criteria for spot ETFs, they might have cheaper management fees \u00b7 Decay and divergence potential \u00b7 There is no physically-backed Bitcoin in the ETF \u00b7 Traditional exchanges have trading hours that are limited, as opposed to cryptocurrency exchanges, which are open 24/7\n\nHow to Become BlackRock ETF Customer?\n\nIn order to enable ETF trading, BlackRock created iShares . With a portfolio of more than 1,250 products, iShares is the market leader in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worldwide. iShares ETFs, a division of BlackRock, leverage knowledge and innovation to advance the financial sector and the interests of our investors.\n\nAccording to the company , iShares ETFs can be bought and sold during normal trading hours through the one\u2019s broker or trading platform. To trade iShares ETFs, one can use any online, discount or full-service brokerage account.\n\niShares ETFs are traded in Canada on the NEO platform or the Toronto Stock platform.\n\nThey are available for trading at any time throughout regular market trading hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM), and all stock-specific trading methods, including market, limit, and stop orders, are permitted.\n\nWhy Invest With BlackRock \u2013 Why BlackRock Stands Better Chances?\n\nDue to the promise of a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d between exchanges, Blackrock\u2019s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust application to the SEC this week may have a better chance than prior attempts by other fund managers.\n\nOn page 36 of the aforementioned Nasdaq 19b-4 filing (where the proposed ETF will be listed), it is indicated that Nasdaq would be involved in entering into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a spot trading platform for Bitcoin (BTC) in order to mitigate against market manipulation.\n\nSurveillance-sharing agreements permit the exchange of data regarding customer identification, clearing activities, and market trading activity, which greatly reduces the likelihood of market manipulation.\n\nAccording to Graeme Moore , Head of Tokenization, Polymesh Association, not just the company\u2019s size as the largest asset manager in the world, but also the planned surveillance-sharing agreement, known as the \u201cSpot BTC SSA,\u201d is what differentiates this application.\n\nCardano\u2019s Founder Calls BlackRock Greedy\n\nHowever, not everyone seems to approve the BlackRock\u2019s move. The creator of the Cardano blockchain, Charles Hoskinon, is among those who aren\u2019t really thrilled about it. Hoskinson lambasted those who applauded the participation of the massive asset management company in a tweet , alleging that their actions revealed dubious morals, mental health, and greed.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1669471985611538433\n\nFurthermore, Hoskinson came to the conclusion that maximalists, who have extreme beliefs in favor of a single cryptocurrency, are zealots out to destroy the entire sector.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s stance indicates his disapproval of those who demonstrate fierce allegiance to a single cryptocurrency and reject any kind of accommodation or cooperation. Maximalists frequently assume that their preferred cryptocurrency is the best option available and discount the potential advantages of other projects or institutional support."

        "content": "Some of the biggest names in finance are making new bets on cryptocurrencies, adding competition and momentum to an upstart industry that is under increasing pressure from US regulators.\n\nThe world's largest money manager, BlackRock (BLK), wants to start a new exchange-traded fund that would use bitcoin as an underlying asset.\n\nTwo other sizable money managers, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab (SCHW), are backing a new cryptocurrency exchange with Citadel Securities.\n\nAnd one of the world's biggest lenders, Deutsche Bank, wants to operate a crypto custody business that would hold digital assets for its clients.\n\nThese endorsements from institutions that have a track record on Wall Street are helping to push the value of cryptocurrencies higher, especially bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest price in a year on Friday, to $31,389, after climbing above $30,000 for the first time since April. Through Friday bitcoin had risen 81% year to date.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies also surged this week, including ether (ETH-USD) and Avalanche's AVAX (AVAX-USD) token.\n\nThe total market capitalization for crypto assets reached $1.2 trillion on Friday, 14% higher than where it stood a week earlier.\n\nRising peril\n\nThis new interest from mainstream financial institutions comes at a time of rising peril for an industry that struggled to regain its footing following the 2022 implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the regulatory crackdown that followed.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month filed lawsuits against the biggest crypto exchanges in the US and the world, Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, alleging they both allowed digital currencies to trade on their platforms that should have been registered with the agency.\n\nThat stoked new concerns that it could become more difficult to trade certain digital assets. Since the beginning of 2023 the SEC has charged 15 different crypto actors with violating securities laws.\n\nStory continues\n\nA surprise turnaround in sentiment about the industry started June 15, when BlackRock, which controls more than $9 trillion in assets, filed paperwork with the SEC to create a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nSuch a fund would be tagged to the value of the original digital asset instead of merely tracking bitcoin futures. Coinbase would be the custodian for the bitcoin holdings.\n\n\"I think there's an element of \u2014 we need institutional custodians to step in and play roles and participate in digital token economies,\" BlackRock\u2019s head of strategic partnerships Joseph Chalom said Thursday at the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit in partnership with the FT.\n\nThe value of bitcoin soared on the announcement. Other institutional players such as Invesco and Wisdom Tree Investments quickly followed by renewing spot bitcoin ETF applications they had previously submitted to regulators.\n\nThe efforts still face a significant hurdle. The SEC has denied 27 prior applications to create spot bitcoin ETFs since 2013, arguing the products are vulnerable to market manipulation.\n\nWisdom Tree, in fact, was turned away in 2021. One asset manager, Grayscale Investments, is suing the SEC because it wasn't allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin offering.\n\n'Conflicts of interest'\n\nAnother catalyst for the industry came this week when a new cryptocurrency exchange that has backing from Citadel, Fidelity and Charles Schwab said it had begun executing trades.\n\nThe venture, EDX Markets, began discussing its plans in late 2022 and touting itself as an operation that would \"remove significant conflicts of interest that affect existing cryptocurrency exchanges.\"\n\nIt made the same point again last week, citing a \"non-custodial model designed to mitigate conflicts of interest.\" It won't handle digital assets owned by customers, instead running a marketplace where buyers and sellers deal with each other directly.\n\nAs part of FTX's collapse last year it was revealed that an affiliated trading firm used customer assets to make its own trades. The SEC has also alleged that Binance misused customer funds, a charge Binance denies.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nEarlier this month SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a briefing with reporters that a standard business model for crypto exchanges is \"built on conflicts,\" \"limited disclosure\u201d and \u201cat times deception.\"\n\nJamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX, said in an interview that \"FTX just validated our business model.\" What EDC is doing, he added, is \"taking the best of the digital world, 24 by seven trading, many of the innovations of blockchain and combining it with the investor protections in traditional finance.\"\n\nEDX says it will offer trading in just four cryptocurrencies\u2014bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash. None of those assets have been deemed securities by the SEC, allowing EDX to potentially sidestep some of the problems encountered by Coinbase and Binance.\n\nTogether those exchanges allow the trading of 19 digital currencies that the SEC has labeled as securities, meaning they need to be registered with the agency. In total the agency has designated 55 cryptocurrencies as securities in various lawsuits, according to data compiled by Cryptorank.io.\n\nCoinbase is fighting the suit and denies the SEC's claims. On Thursday its CEO Brian Armstrong did not sound worried while speaking at a crypto conference in New York.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. (Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images) (Steven Ferdman via Getty Images)\n\nInstead he said in the next five to seven years the Coinbase platform could turn into a \"superapp' like WeChat, which is used in Asia for everything from messaging to banking to ordering food.\n\n\"Despite some negative rhetoric, headlines, this industry is moving forward,\" he said.\n\nRoger Bayston, head of digital assets for Franklin Templeton, said the scrutiny from regulators is necessary.\n\n\"\u200b\u200bAs much as it's been bumpy, regulatory clarity really is clearing the decks for the adoption of standards that will allow capital to flow,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

Can it continue?\n\nThat is the question on every trader\u2019s mind this week. $30,000 held into the weekly close and beyond, but in a volatile crypto market, anything can and does happen.\n\nThe macroeconomic climate is somewhat \u201cstandard\u201d for the final week of June, offering some potential risk asset price catalysts but avoiding several major data releases at once.\n\nThe weekend\u2019s news out of Russia appears to have had little impact on market performance elsewhere, having mostly concluded before the start of the week\u2019s trading.\n\nTurning to Bitcoin itself, a phase of taking stock appears to be here, with fundamentals conversely primed to shift down from all-time highs.\n\nThe sentiment is volatile, too, with $30,000 in particular, a pivotal level.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at these factors and more in the weekly rundown of what is moving BTC price action in the short term.\n\nBitcoin bulls protect $30,000 at weekly close\n\nBitcoin drifted lower through the final part of the weekend after briefly touching $31,000.\n\nDespite a lack of momentum, bulls managed to defend the $30,000 mark overnight, and at the time of writing on June 26, $30,500 was back as a focus, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart.

The RHODL ratio looks at the one-week band versus the one to two years band.\n\n\u201cIt also calibrates for increased hodl\u2019ing over time and for lost coins by multiplying the ratio by the age of the market in number of days. When the 1-week value is significantly higher than the 1-2yr it is a signal that the market is becoming overheated,\u201d Swift explains in his introduction on LookIntoBitcoin.\n\nWhile complex on paper, the RHODL ratio acts as a useful tool for Bitcoin price cycles and is currently repeating classic behavior expected at the start of bull markets.\n\nWhile the property of long-term hodlers at the end of 2022, opportunistic traders are now stepping in again, the metric suggests, indicative of a transition to broader mainstream trading interest.\n\n\u201cAs new players begin to enter the market and younger coins hold greater value, the RHODL Ratio is looking primed for a new breakout,\u201d Swift commented.\n\nBitcoin RHODL ratio annotated chart.

        "title": "Bitcoin needs to survive recession to show bulls 'divergent strength': Strategist - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin prices hover above $30,000 as the crpytocurrency is facing headwinds tied to the potential recession. Mike McGlone, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategist, highlights the outlook for Bitcoin, while also commenting on how geopolitical pressures are hitting oil prices.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Meanwhile, Bitcoin hovering around that $30,000 mark after getting a boost from the potential launch of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF. But our next guest warns that this won't shield the asset from its first US recession. Mike McGlone Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategist joins us now.\n\nMike, good morning, first off. So tell us about how-- so crypto had been going through what we call a crypto winter, which includes Bitcoin obviously. So but it's seen a bid recently. Why do you say that it is-- I mean, this seems like it's temporary, I guess?\n\nWell, Bitcoin both hope it's not temporary. The key reason it had this bid recently because the BlackRock-- the BlackRock application for ETFs. Most people think that means they will be approved in the US. But that's still an if statement. It might not happen this year.\n\nThe key thing to remember about Bitcoin is when this whole situation started with COVID, it went down when the-- with the NASDAQ. It went up with all the liquidity. It's gone back down. Now it's gone back up with the stock market.\n\nSo for it to show divergence strength away from the stock market, I think it has to probably get through this recession, which we all know is coming. If you look at the yield curve, it's a matter of time. And to see if it can show divergence strength with the stock market going down as the Fed has pointed out. They are not going to be there to cut rates, which probably is bearish for equity markets.\n\nOr does Bitcoin outperform on the way up? I look at it as, it's got to prove itself. And at 30,000, about 3,100 this weekend-- or 31,000 this week. And I think it's just a little bit too risky here, particularly if we tilt over to recession, it brings most assets, risk assets lower.\n\nStory continues\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Hey, Mike. It's Julie. It is fantastic to see you. So it sounds like you don't think it's going to hold above 30 certainly in the near or even medium term?\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: Well, I'm much more worried that of the whole tide going out because of this recession and the risk that everybody's priced in for the bullish scenario. The Fed's going to ease. The Fed is going to save us. Yet Jerome Powell says he's not going to.\n\nLook at the interest rate expectations, there's not going to-- there's still price for higher rates. So we're getting liquidity pools, meaning higher rates in England, in Canada, in most of the rest of the world. And that's just not a good environment for an expanding global economy that's maybe tilting over to recession.\n\nPeople are hoping for, yeah, even if we go for recession, the Fed will ease and save these risk assets. The key point is, Bitcoin is still very much trading like a risk asset, like the stock market. Now you look at things like gold and treasury bonds, they might be better off.\n\nSo it's got to prove it. And the best way to prove it is to get through this recession and prove it. Otherwise, it's just a faster version of the stock market, which I think most people are looking for this fastest-- faster horse in the race to transition to trade more like maybe gold and long bonds.\n\nAnd basically, you have to be bullish to stock market here and expect Bitcoin outperform. Otherwise, to me the key risk is the tide goes out and Bitcoin is the fastest horse in the race and it kind of leads the way.\n\n- Mike, so we also know there's been a crypto crackdown, if you will, when you think about Coinbase, Binance. What do you make of the regulatory climate for crypto? It seems to be simmering recently. But it could just be a back burner thing right now.\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: It's going to last for a while, but this is a revolutionary technology. And oftentimes, that's what humans do when something comes in that they don't understand. Which is OK.\n\nThe key thing about the crackdown I think is prudent is we have to purge some of the massive speculation in space. All revolutionary technologies have massive speculation.\n\nI was reading this weekend about RCA, the radio company went from 3 to 300 and then back down. These things happen. But there's 25,000 cryptos in each purge. And then there's Bitcoin, and Ethereum, and crypto dollars. That's very significant revolution in technology.\n\nThe key thing is Bitcoin is going so far, so fast and it still just has a-- it's got to prove it's not just going to go up more than the stock market. And that's the key thing that most of our viewers and listeners have not lived through a true stock bear market where it drops 20%, the Fed doesn't save you, and then it drops another 20%. To me, that's the risk in the broad market.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Mike, I want to turn to more traditional commodities now, especially in the back of the news out of Russia over the weekend where the coup seems to have been averted. We are seeing a little bit of a lift to oil price but not that much.\n\nBut maybe this is a reminder for us, right, that the situation still happening. The markets have sort of adjusted to this as the status quo. But that can change, right?\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: Well, it is great to see you, Julie. I glanced down to see you on the screen a little bit. I haven't seen in a while since working with you at Bloomberg.\n\nBut crude oil commodities are a bear market. They're down. They were down almost 30% for a little while from the pink. Down 20% now on a year over year basis.\n\nAnd the key question you have to ask yourself is what's going to stop this and save it. Typically, it takes a long and variable lag at the Federal Reserve easing. What are they doing? They're still tightening.\n\nNow you see what's happening in China. China's leader made a major mistake of his unlimited friendship with Mr. Putin. And what's that doing overall, to me, it's tilting the whole world towards recession. China is having a problem and all the data is disappointing. That's the body in motion. You have to ask yourself what stops it?\n\nSo I see crude oil is more likely to head towards 50, maybe even 40 priced on what has already happened. Natural gas has already done that. Natural gas went from 10 to 2 and now it's bouncing.\n\nAnd I see the whole commodity market in a bear market. And the question is, I don't see anything stopping it. So I think the best commodity might be continue to perform well in the next year or so is probably gold as we tilt towards recession.\n\nAnd maybe we eventually get a Federal Reserve pivot or ease. But for a commodity bottom in the commodity market, typically, we are way too early. Typically, you need to see a lag to easing and we haven't even started that yet.\n\n- But, Mike, OK, so you're saying, you're seeing crude head down to 50. Right now we just put up a chart where crude is sitting near $70 a barrel. You know, I mean that seems-- I just-- that seems like such a sharp drop from where we are now.\n\nAnd the talk of a recession is starting to kind of be pushed back from a lot of analysts and economists that we speak to. What's the-- what's the base case for crude heading to $50 a barrel?\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: So I like to ask, what part of an inverted curve, plunging commodities, and the Federal Reserve over most central banks still tightening leads to the recession being over?\n\nRight now, we're seeing a bounce. But I did make the call for $50 a barrel a long time ago when it was much higher and it was on the way up. That is the trajectory.\n\nThe key thing is that's what it always does is commodities always go towards near the cost of production in the long term and particularly when the economics get a little dicey.\n\nAnd that's happening right now. $50 is the average cost of production in the US. And natural gas, the average cost of production is around two. That's where the markets bottom.\n\nSo right now, the key question I like to ask you, and our viewers, and everybody else is what stops this bear market in crude oil? OPEC's trying to help by cutting supply. But typically, what happens when OPEC keeps cut supply is that happens in bear markets. They're responding to what they see in the macro in a prudent way for a cartel that's trying to boost prices.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Mike, presumably, if indeed there were some sort of resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, some sort of change in leadership in Russia, you could foresee, envision a scenario where you would actually have a pretty big increase in oil supply, right? I mean, probably wouldn't happen right away. But would that be the outcome?\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: Well that, I think that's a good point. First of all, I would expect grain prices to go lower. They already have because the supply elasticity picked up. Remember, Brazil had a bumper crop last year because of prices. Crude oil would probably collapse.\n\nI think it would be very good for the global economic situation that that pressure from this war would be alleviated. To have a change in power, it depends on who comes in and how they do it.\n\nBut overall, that would be a relief and it would accelerate the commodity bear market, I think. And that's the key thing to remember is, we're in a bear market. What stops it?\n\nTypically, you need some major catalysts. And usually, it's from a demand side. And usually from a demand side, you need global economic demand pull and typically, need some help from some Fed and central banks.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Mike, great to see you. Mike McGlone, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategist. Be well. Thanks.\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: Thank you."

        "content": "Ever since the news BlackRock would be filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in the US earlier this month it seems as though tradfi (traditional finance) has been making a land grab on digital assets.\n\nWhile BlackRock was not the first to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), its move has been viewed with extra heft with asset managers including WisdomTree, Invesco and crypto index manager Bitwise Asset Management all reapplying with previously rejected filings.\n\nOthers are expected to follow and it is clear to see why. BlackRock has been denied by the SEC just once in 576 attempts when filing to list new ETFs in the US.\n\nConversely, the SEC is 33-0 in rejecting spot bitcoin ETF filings, highlighting how any decision hangs in the balance.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas gives the filing a 50% chance of succeeding.\n\n\u201cThe deluge of other issuers refiling is part of why BlackRock\u2019s [move] is so monumental and deserves the jump in odds because they know they would kick start all this, annoying the SEC, whom they are close with\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cThey filed anyway, it heightens the, \u2018what does BlackRock know?\u2019 variable in my opinion.\u201d\n\nWhether or not BlackRock succeeds in its filing the move underlines tradfi\u2019s commitment to crypto, even after a bleak \u2018crypto winter\u2019 \u2013 sparked by the collapse of terra and FTX \u2013 and as the SEC sets its sights on crypto exchanges.\n\nBitcoin has rallied 20% in the week since BlackRock filed on 15 June, surpassing the $30,000 mark for the first time since April this year, with the move tipped to renew demand from institutional investors, according to Saxo Bank.\n\nWhile this would serve US institutions initially, the more established European crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) market would also likely feel the impact of a player such as BlackRock entering the fray.\n\nDenys Peleshok, head of Asia at CPT Markets, said: \u201cThe initiative could reinforce the sentiment of increasing interest from large and institutional investors for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.\n\n\u201cA successful launch of a bitcoin ETF could open the way for more inflows from individuals and professional investors alike. The investment vehicle could lower the barrier of entry into the market and attract significant volumes of investment into bitcoin in particular.\u201d\n\nTradfi\u2019s influence on crypto was extended further earlier this week with the launch of a new exchange backed by Fidelity International, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities trading digital assets including bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash.\n\nThe SEC now has a big decision to make. Should BlackRock\u2019s filing be successful, it is unlikely asset managers will look to stop at bitcoin ETFs, with other coins and multi-asset products likely to follow suit."

        "title": "How Much Will Bitcoin Be Worth In 2025? BTC Bulls Market Impacts Caged Beasts & PepeCoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the dominant force in the world of cryptocurrencies, enjoying widespread adoption and popularity. Recent market developments have seen BTC reaching impressive price levels. This article explores how Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence affects other coins, specifically Caged Beasts (BEASTS) and PepeCoin (PEPE).\n\nBitcoin Hits $27,388 on Bitstamp!\n\nWith Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $27,388, the coin almost reached a new high for June. Despite the initial obstacles caused by the SEC\u2019s legal action against Binance and Coinbase, BTC shrugged it off and returned to its comfort zone just below $27,000. Even Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the CEO of trading firm Eight, couldn\u2019t contain his excitement, saying, \u201cBack to $27K! That bounce from the 200-Week MA was awesome. Brace yourselves for the new uptrend to $38-42K on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nOther popular traders seem to agree. They\u2019re calling the BTC price correction \u201cover,\u201d and Rekt Capital, a trader, confirmed that Bitcoin tested and held the 200-week MA as solid support! Analysts believe that by 2025, BTC will be valued at a minimum of $82,711.81 and a maximum of $90,466.04.\n\nCaged Beasts: Liberation Through Innovation\n\nCaged Beasts (BEASTS) is a meme coin with a mission to liberate individuals from the constraints of traditional financial systems. As a community-driven token, BEASTS not only encourages participation but actively engages with their fan base, and gives them a say over its future developments.\n\nBEASTS has incentivized investors to get in on the token early by introducing a two-way referral program. Through personalized referral codes, participants can receive 20% of the deposit made by users who join using their code, while the referred investors also receive an additional 20% in BEASTS tokens.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s resurgence is likely to have a positive impact on Caged Beasts. As BTC\u2019s price rises, it often generates a renewed interest in the broader crypto market. This increased attention can and often does ripple down to the meme coin sector. Between BTC\u2019s bull market, meme coin season, and a list of lucrative benefits, it looks like BEASTS is primed to join the ranks of meme coin royalty alongside Dogecoin!\n\nStory continues\n\nPepeCoin: Facing Challenges Amidst Falling Prices\n\nPepeCoin (PEPE), a popular meme coin, has recently experienced significant price depreciation. With a staggering decline of over 78% from its all-time high, PepeCoin has been on a downward trajectory, losing value consistently. The token has dropped more than 17% in the past seven days and over 54% in the last 30 days, rightly causing distress among investors!\n\nReports indicate that a majority of PepeCoin investors are currently holding their portfolios at a loss, with only a small profit percentage. Analysts express concerns about the continuous price decline, suggesting that early investors may face the risk of losing their profits entirely, while latecomers might find themselves immersed in losses. However, some analysts are optimistic that BTC\u2019s bull market might provide the much-needed impetus for PepeCoin to leap over its hurdles!\n\nBitcoin\u2019s return to bullish ways has far-reaching implications for various cryptocurrencies. The renewed interest in BTC will likely ripple through the market and can drive increased visibility and participation for Caged Beasts in addition to reviving PEPE!\n\nFollow the Links For More Information on Caged Beasts!\n\nWebsite: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS"

        "title": "US Treasury yields are rising \u2014 What does it mean for Bitcoin price? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "United States government bonds, or Treasurys, have a tremendous influence across all tradeable markets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). In that sense, risk calculation in finance is relative, so every loan, mortgage and even cryptocurrency derivatives depends on the cost of capital attributed to U.S. dollars.\n\nAssuming the worst-case scenario of the U.S. government eventually defaulting on its own debt, what happens to the families, businesses and countries holding those bonds? The lack of interest debt payments would likely cause a global shortage of U.S. dollars, triggering a cascading effect.\n\nBut, even if that scenario comes to fruition, history shows us that cryptocurrencies may work as a hedge during periods of uncertainty. For instance, Bitcoin vastly outperformed traditional wealth preservation assets during the U.S.-China trade war in May 2021. Bitcoin gained 47% between May 5 and May 31 of that year, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 8.7%.\n\nAs the general public owns over $29 trillion in the U.S. Treasury, they are deemed the lowest-risk financial product in existence. Still, the price for each of those government bonds, or the yield traded, will vary depending on the contract maturity. Assuming there\u2019s no counterparty risk for this asset class, the single most important pricing factor is the inflation expectation.\n\nLet\u2019s explore whether Bitcoin\u2019s and Ether\u2019s price will be impacted by the growing demand for U.S. Treasurys.\n\nHigher demand for government bonds leads to lower yields\n\nIf one believes that inflation will not be restrained anytime soon, this investor is likely to seek a higher yield when trading the Treasury. On the other hand, if the U.S. government is actively devaluing its currency or there\u2019s an expectation for additional inflation, investors will tend to seek refuge in U.S. Treasurys, causing lower yield.\n\nU.S. 5-year government bond yield. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice how the five-year Treasury yield reached 4.05% on June 22, the highest level in more than three months. This movement happened while the U.S. Consumer Price Index for May came in at 4.0% on a year-on-year basis, the lowest growth of inflation since March 2021.\n\nA 4.05% yield indicates that investors are not expecting inflation to drop below the central bank's 2% target anytime soon, but it also shows confidence that the 9.1% peak CPI data from June 2022 is behind us. However, that\u2019s not how Treasury pricing works because investors are willing to forego rewards in exchange for the security of owning the lowest-risk asset.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields are a great tool for comparing other countries and corporate debt, but not in absolute terms. These government bonds will reflect inflation expectations, but they may be severely constrained if a global recession becomes more likely.\n\nU.S. 5-year government bond yield vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange). Source: TradingView\n\nThe typical inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the U.S. Treasury yield has been invalidated in the past 10 days, most likely because investors are desperately buying government bonds for their safety regardless of the yield being lower than inflation expectations.\n\nThe S&P 500 index, which measures the U.S. stock market, hit 4,430 on June 16, just 7.6% below its all-time high, which also explains the higher yields. While investors typically seek scarce and inflation protected assets ahead of turbulent times, their appetite for excessive equity valuations is limited.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price data suggests bulls will succeed in holding $30K as support this time\n\nRecession risks could have distorted the yield data\n\nThe only certain thing at the moment is that investors\u2019 expectations for a recession are becoming more evident. Aside from the Treasury\u2019s yield, the U.S. Conference Board\u2019s leading indicators declined for 14 consecutive months, as described by Charlie Bilello:\n\nThe Conference Board's Leading Economic Index declined in May for the 14th month in a row.\n\n\n\n\"We project that the US economy will contract over the Q3 2023 to Q1 2024 period. The recession likely will be due to continued tightness in monetary policy and lower government spending.\u201d\u2026 pic.twitter.com/wQfy8a3DVq \u2014 Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) June 23, 2023\n\nConsequently, those betting that Bitcoin\u2019s recent decoupling from the U.S. Treasury's yield inverse correlation will quickly revert might come out disappointed. Data confirms that government bond yields are higher than normal due to increased expectations of a recession and economic crisis ahead.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 Mining today announced it has arranged a $50 million credit facility through Coinbase Credit, the subsidiary of America\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\n\nThe Canadian company said it\u2019ll use proceeds from the loan \u201cfor general corporate purposes.\u201d\n\n\"This credit facility gives us additional financial flexibility,\" Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton said in a statement. \"At the same time, it ensures that we can maintain our dynamic Bitcoin treasury management strategy going into the halving.\"\n\nAs of May 2023, Hut 8\u2019s holdings stood at 9,233 BTC, worth roughly $280 million at current prices.\n\nSharing details of the agreement, Hut 8 said the facility provides a $15 million term loan that is expected to be funded either at or shortly after the closing of the agreement.\n\nFurthermore, the loan agreement includes an option for an additional $20 million delayed-draw term loan tranche, which can be accessed through a second borrowing between one and two months after the closing.\n\nFinally, there is an option for a third $15 million delayed-draw term loan tranche, provided within 15 business days following the completion of the previously announced merger between Hut 8 and U.S. Data Mining Group, better known was U.S. Bitcoin Corp.\n\n\"We have one of the largest self-mined Bitcoin stacks of any publicly traded company, and this credit facility allows us to maintain our HODL strategy while giving us financial flexibility,\" a spokesperson for Hut 8 told Decrypt.\n\nA New Bitcoin Mining Giant Prepares to Enter the Fray\n\nHut 8 has established itself as a significant player in the Bitcoin mining sector, demonstrating a commitment to holding onto its BTC holdings despite the considerable financial challenges faced by the industry during the bear market of 2022.\n\nUnlike several other major Bitcoin mining firms such as Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain, which at one point last year had to sell more Bitcoin than they produced, the Toronto-based company has remained dedicated to its \"long-standing HODL strategy,\" retaining its holdings rather than liquidating them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe \"HODL strategy\" refers to the practice of holding onto cryptocurrencies for the long term, often driven by the belief in the potential appreciation of their value over time. In case of Bitcoin, as many proponents of the world's largest cryptocurrency argue, this strategy could also be profitable considering the halving events that happen approximately every four years.\n\nBitcoin halving is a built-in mechanism designed to control the issuance of new Bitcoins and maintain scarcity of the leading cryptocurrency. Each halving results in Bitcoin miners' reward reduced by half. The purpose is to gradually reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, ultimately leading to a maximum supply of 21 million coins.\n\nIn February this year, Hut 8 and U.S. Bitcoin Corp, a Florida-based Bitcoin mining company, announced \u201ca merger of equals,\u201d with the to-be-established entity to be based in the U.S.\n\nWhen completed, the merger is expected to result in creation of one of the largest crypto mining entities in North America with facilities across Ontario, Nebraska, and Texas."

They offer traders exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures based on derivative contracts that trade on commodity exchanges.\n\nThe specific offerings are CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF, a representative from HSBC Hong Kong confirmed to Decrypt. The news was first reported by Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu.\n\nSCOOP: HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, today allows its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on the Hong Kong exchange, and is also the first bank in Hong Kong to allow it. The move will expand local users\u2019 exposure to cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/vH0LieSVGw \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 26, 2023\n\nHSBC is the largest bank in Hong Kong, Wu said, and HSBC is the first lender in Hong Kong to allow its customers access to digital asset ETFs.\n\nAdding ETFs to its investment platform offers HSBC Hong Kong investors access to derivatives, without which customers might seek out access on an unregulated exchange, possibly using a VPN, Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clear opportunity for [HSBC] to get ahead and offer this one product that is otherwise not allowed in Hong Kong,\u201d he said, adding there\u2019s a \u201cclear customer need.\u201d\n\nThe CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF and CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF are managed by CSOP Asset Management, a firm that saw the two products listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December of last year. The two ETFs were the first in Asia to track digital asset futures, according to the firm\u2019s website.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth ETFs invest in futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), making them an \u201ceasy transparent way for investors to capture the performance\u201d of Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to CSOP Asset Management.\n\nThe Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF is managed by Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong and invests in CME contracts as well, but launched in January of this year.\n\nWhile there\u2019s robust demand for spot access to crypto among retail investors in Hong Kong, Feng said that the demand for derivatives is equal, if not greater. And ETFs allow companies to offer exposure to crypto without opening themselves to regulatory risk in a nascent industry to which Hong Kong has only recently signaled openness.\n\n\u201cIf all of the centralized exchanges are getting this much regulatory scrutiny, it wouldn't be too wise to go out and try to launch another,\u201d Feng said of crypto exchanges more generally. \u201cIt's much safer to do what's already been proven. There's a clear playbook.\u201d\n\nFutures ETFs correlated to the performance of digital assets are nothing new in the United States. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not approved a spot-based Bitcoin ETF yet\u2014BlackRock wants to change that\u2014ProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF launched on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.\n\nFeng said the \u201csimplicity and convenience\u201d of ETFs make them a much more palatable option for retail traders compared to other derivatives, such as options, where traders need to understand concepts like strike prices and gamma.\n\n\u201cWhen you have simplicity, what you eventually will get is volume,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will eventually speculate because it\u2019s just so easy.\u201d"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFidelity, an asset management firm with over $4 trillion under its management, might be making big moves on Bitcoin\n\nAn even bigger firm, Blackrock, has already applied for a Bitcoin spot trading ETF\n\nStakeholders are not happy about the world\u2019s wealthiest taking over a market that was meant to be decentralized\n\nCrypto expert, Andrew Parish raised a flag concerning Fidelity, the world\u2019s third-largest asset management making moves on the Bitcoin trading market. Parish predicts that Fidelity is either going to apply for their own Bitcoin ETF and/or move to take over Grayscale \u2014 Grayscale runs 17 cryptocurrency trusts, including single and multi-asset funds.\n\nUPDATE: @DigitalAssets and @Fidelity is about to make a seismic move in crypto via both $BTC and $ETH . Sources expect Fidelity to either make a bid for @Grayscale or quickly launch their own spot #bitcoin ETF. One or both are coming, soon. **Blackrock and Fidelity will own\u2026 \u2014 Andrew (@AP_Abacus) June 18, 2023\n\nFidelity is one of two giant asset management firms potentially making moves in the Bitcoin trading space. The other company is Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset management firm, with an asset portfolio of over $9 trillion.\n\nBlackrock, which owns major stakes in prominent brands like Spotify and Uber, has applied for a Bitcoin spot trading ETF. Blackrock\u2019s ETF application is yet to be approved by the regulating committee. However, only one of Blackrock\u2019s 576 ETF applications has ever been denied before. That one denied request was because the company was insufficiently transparent regarding its business goals for said ETF.\n\nUnderstandably, the crypto (namely Bitcoin) community is not excited about corporations that already controlled fiat currencies potentially taking control of the Bitcoin market. But, technology and regulations might just be paving the way for that transformation.\n\nWho Is Fidelity?\n\nFidelity was established in 1946, under the management of FMR, which is a company owned and run by the Johnson Family, one of the US\u2019s richest families. The company manages assets that are worth over $10 trillion starting December 2022.\n\nThe company\u2019s description depicts it as \u201ccrypto curious\u201d since it experimented with mining Bitcoin back in 2014. More recently, Fidelity launched a crypto-only arm, called Fidelity Digital Assets, or FDA for short. Ever since FDA received New York Trust Charter and launched its European operations in 2020.\n\nThe company Fidelity may take over, Grayscale, offers the option to investors to invest in crypto assets by buying shares in its trust. Grayscale has also been trying to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot Bitcoin ETF for years, but the SEC has been in the way the whole time. It got to the point where Grayscale actually sued SEC over the matter.\n\nAddendum: wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Fidelity offer staking soon. pic.twitter.com/GRyYx6u5cH \u2014 Andrew (@AP_Abacus) June 18, 2023\n\nAn Even Bigger Shark In The Water\n\nLearning that Fidelity is potentially making moves on the crypto market is alarming enough for stakeholders. But, knowing that Blackrock has already applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF spells near certainty that the Bitcoin market is about to witness a huge balance shift.\n\nLong story short, Blackrock is the world\u2019s biggest asset management firm. Needless to say, a company that owns more assets than any other organization entering the crypto space will not only influence the prices and availability of Bitcoin but also cause a power shift in the market, effectively controlling market prices.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s application noted that the company will be using Coinbase as its crypto custodian. In 2019, Coinbase acquired Xapo, an institutional-scale crypto custody tool.\n\nConsidering Coinbase is currently facing a lawsuit filed by the SEC, alleging that the crypto exchange traded in \u201cunregistered securities\u201d, some worry that the SEC might take Coinbase out of the picture, leaving Blackrock to freely takeover Xapo.\n\nBitcoin Stakeholders React Differently\n\nLogically, knowing that a major corporation might start buying Bitcoin in large sums would result in the market hiking up the price of Bitcoin. That all sounds well and good for some Bitcoin holders who look forward to their possessions gaining higher values. However, many, if not the majority of, Bitcoin holders, enthusiasts saw Bitcoin (and altcoins) as a way out of the fiat market that is strictly controlled by the richest corporation and politicians.\n\nFor that very reason, the crypto community is divided into two factions:- First are those who welcome Blackrock and Fidelity, waiting for their Bitcoins to get pricier, hence increasing their personal wealth. The other faction is made up of ones who fear for the future of crypto, seeing that Blackrock and Fidelity signal an omen of the end of a decentralized market, once again controlled by a handful of powerful individuals."

Wouldn\u2019t that be something? A decade of failed attempts, BlackRock shows up and they can get it immediately. A testament to our corrupted financial system. Poetic really. \u2014 David Bailey\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf7 redeemGBTC.com (@DavidFBailey) June 19, 2023\n\nBlackRock\u2019s entry into the Bitcoin ETF market, according to Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc. and a board member at the University of Alabama, may tilt the scales in favor of regulatory adoption.\n\nBailey\u2019s most recent remarks regarding the likely approval of BlackRock\u2019s BTC ETF are based on the asset management company\u2019s June 15th filing with the SEC.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would give investors a way to invest in Bitcoin without really possessing it, which may have a big impact on the price of BTC.\n\nStill, an analyst under the Twitter name Credible Crypto commented that instead of being a reason for fear, Bitcoin\u2019s decline below $30,000 is a crucial stage in the cryptocurrency\u2019s upward trend toward new annual highs.\n\n\u201cThe situation with Bitcoin right now is like a kerosene-soaked rag in the middle of a forest filled with dead trees \u2013 all it will take is a single spark of demand (could be in the form of a number of positive fundamental catalysts \u2013 the reason behind the spark doesn\u2019t matter) to set that rag on fire. And once that rag is on fire, the move-up will start. Slowly at first, then all at once \u2013 just as a forest fire starts from a single spark and soon becomes an uncontrollable blaze, obliterating anything and anyone in its way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SEC has Not Specified a Deadline for its Decision\n\nETF approval by the SEC can be a protracted and difficult procedure. ETF plans must be evaluated by the SEC to make sure they are in the best interests of investors and that they adhere to all applicable rules and regulations.\n\nSince the SEC has raised worries about the possibility of fraud and market manipulation in the cryptocurrency market, the agency has typically taken several months to review and approve Bitcoin ETF proposals.\n\nThe SEC has already turned down many proposals for Bitcoin ETFs due to worries about market volatility, liquidity, and the possibility of fraud.\n\nThe regulator, on the other hand, may soon be more receptive to licensing a Bitcoin ETF, according to some analysts, given recent developments like the increased institutional acceptance of Bitcoin.\n\nThe fact that BlackRock, one of the biggest asset managers in the world, is supporting the new Bitcoin ETF, in light of these developments, could be a game changer, claims Bailey. According to him, authorities may find it simpler to approve the product in a matter of \u201cdays to weeks\u201d due to BlackRock\u2019s name and clout in the financial sector.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the SEC hasn\u2019t announced a specific date when it will decide whether to approve BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF or any other pending ETF proposals. A proposal may not be approved at all, or it may take several months or even years, due to the agency\u2019s often opaque approval procedure.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Reacted By Jumping Over 12%\n\nBlackRock\u2019s knock-on effects have boosted investor optimism and driven Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to new heights.\n\nBefore the markets closed on Friday, GBTC saw a gain of more than 12%, with share prices reaching $15.12, according to Yahoo Finance . In celebration of Juneteenth, a federal holiday marking the day word reached Texas that slaves had been freed, U.S. markets were closed on Monday.\n\nWith the help of Grayscale\u2019s flagship product, GBTC, investors can trade shares in trusts that hold pools of Bitcoin, with each share intended to reflect the current price of Bitcoin. This allows investors to obtain exposure to Bitcoin without having to purchase and hold the commodity directly.\n\nAccording to YCharts , the so-called \u201cGBTC Discount,\u201d which measures the price difference between Bitcoin and other currencies, reached a monthly low of -36.61% when the price of Bitcoin was $26,436. The net asset value (NAV) of GBTC\u2019s Bitcoin holdings is different from the price of the shares, and this is referred to as the discount.\n\nBullish Days Ahead?\n\nBut today seems to be a bullish day for investors. BlackRock\u2019s flawless track record for ETF applications (now at 575-1) has given GBTC a breath of fresh air despite what seems to be an ongoing legal struggle with the SEC.\n\nThe SEC has been unrelenting in its \u201canti-crypto\u201d attitude, suing a number of well-known business figures in recent weeks. Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, is well-known for having instructed a course on Bitcoin and blockchain technology at MIT. He has been a fierce opponent of the cryptocurrency industry."

        "content": "The Canadian Bitcoin (BTC) mining company, Hut 8 Mining, has secured a credit facility from a subsidiary of the United States-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase.\n\nHut 8 officially announced on June 26 that it entered a $50 million credit agreement with Coinbase Credit. The credit facility involved Hut 8\u2019s subsidiary, Hut 8 Holdings, as the borrower.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the loan proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The credit facility provides a $15 million term loan that is expected to be funded at or subsequently after closing.\n\nThe loan provides an option of getting an additional $20 million delayed-draw term loan tranche in a second borrowing between one and two months following closing. The facility also offers a third option of drawing an additional $15 million delayed-draw term loan tranche.\n\nThe last tranche would be the third borrowing provided within 15 business days following the completion of the previously announced merger between Hut 8 and U.S. Data Mining Group, also known as US Bitcoin, the announcement notes.\n\nAccording to Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton, the credit facility provides the firm with additional financial flexibility. He mentioned the importance of the credit facility in the context of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which is set to reduce the BTC miner block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nLeverton stated:\n\n\u201cAt the same time, it ensures that we can maintain our dynamic Bitcoin treasury management strategy going into the halving.\u201c\n\nBitcoin halvings have been traditionally linked with bull runs, Hut 8's senior vice president for communications Erin Dermer noted in an email to Cointelegraph. \"So maintaining a strong Bitcoin stack could prove to be advantageous for us,\" she said, adding:\n\n\"We have one of the largest self-mined Bitcoin stacks of any publicly traded company, and this credit facility allows us to maintain our HODL strategy while giving us the financial flexibility to manage our business.\"\n\nHut 8 has emerged as a major Bitcoin miner that continued to hodl BTC despite massive financial issues faced by the BTC mining industry. While some mining firms like Argo Blockchain were forced to sell portions of their BTC holdings amid the bear market of 2022, Hut 8 has remained true to its \u201clong-standing HODL strategy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miner Core Scientific files its Chapter 11 plan\n\nThe Canadian firm held a total of 9,133 self-mined Bitcoin held in custody as of March 31, 2023, Hut 8 wrote in its Q1 2023 financial update. \u201cLeading up to the halving, we will continue to focus on strategically increasing our stack of Bitcoin and growing our HPC business including exploring opportunities in the growing artificial intelligence market,\u201d the CEO said at the time.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019"

Discover SCENE\n\nBling Financial develops and publishes iOS and Android games that riff on familiar and well-trodden genres and formulas, ranging from the solitaire card game to bubble-popping puzzle games. But there\u2019s a compelling twist in the mix: You can earn small amounts of Bitcoin or Ethereum by playing.\n\nThis feature is not enabled by default when you start playing Bling games like Sweet Bitcoin, Ethereum Blast, or Bitcoin Pop. Luckily, it\u2019s easy to start earning Bling Points while you play levels and watch ads, and then those Points can be converted into BTC or ETH and then deposited into a Coinbase account, or converted into U.S. dollars and sent to a PayPal account.\n\nWant to earn a little crypto while gaming? Here\u2019s another way to do so.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow do I turn on crypto earnings?\n\nBy default, Bling\u2019s games just look and play like standard mobile games\u2014albeit ones with a lot of video ads in the mix. To earn cryptocurrency for playing, you\u2019ll need to enable the feature by signing in with an account.\n\nJust tap the \u201cGet Started\u201d button at the top of a Bling app screen and then choose whether to log in with a Google or Facebook account or Apple account if you're using iOS. Tapping the downward-pointing arrow at the bottom also unearths an option to log in with an email address instead. Once logged in, you\u2019ll earn Bling Points that can be redeemed for Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nScreenshots from Sweet Bitcoin, a Bling Financial game. Image: Decrypt\n\nRecently, Bling Financial has launched a daily bonus feature across its games to keep players coming back regularly. You'll earn bonus points while playing, with daily challenges that you can complete to upgrade your tier level, thus boosting your rewards.\n\nBut if you don't play daily, then you'll lose \"spicy peppers\" to feed your pet, and thus fall lower down the ranks and get less of a points boost. Basically, it comes down to this: Play regularly, and earn more points that can be converted into crypto.\n\nScreenshots from Bling Financial's bonus system. Image: Decrypt's GG\n\nWhich games does this work with?\n\nAs of this writing, Bling offers nine mobile games across iOS and Android that offer crypto rewards. Some are developed by Bling and others were created by other studios, but the in-game interfaces are largely identical\u2014and they all share the same Bling account so you can earn across games. Here are the games available so far, although this list may change over time:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin Blast ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Blocks ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Food Fight ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Pop ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Solitaire ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Sudoku ( iOS | Android )\n\nEthereum Blast ( iOS | Android )\n\nSweet Bitcoin ( iOS | Android )\n\nWord Breeze ( iOS | Android )\n\nHow do I cash out?\n\nYou\u2019ll need to use the Bling Financial website to cash in your earned points for cryptocurrency and deposit your winnings. Simply click the \u201cCash Out\u201d button in the upper right corner of the Bling website, and then log in with the same account you used in the Bling app.\n\nConverting Bling Points to Bitcoin.

In this example, I have nearly 60,000 Bling points, which equates to 0.00000060 BTC\u2014or about $0.04 worth of Bitcoin as of this writing.\n\nYou can then choose either Bitcoin or Ethereum, and have the earnings transferred to a Coinbase account\u2014or you can choose U.S. dollars and send that to a PayPal account. After cashing out, you\u2019ll have to wait seven days to do so again.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on June 26, 2023 and last updated with new details on March 13, 2024."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction as Bulls Push BTC Up From Recent Bottom at $26,200 \u2013 Where is BTC Heading Next?\n\nBitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, experienced a recent dip that saw its price reach a bottom at $26,200.\n\nHowever, a surge of bullish activity has propelled BTC back up, raising questions about its future trajectory.\n\nTraders and investors eagerly await insights into where Bitcoin is headed next. Will its upward momentum continue, or is there potential for a reversal?\n\nIn this Bitcoin price prediction, we will explore various factors and trends to provide a Bitcoin price prediction and shed light on the future direction of BTC.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nIn analyzing the technical aspects of Bitcoin, we observe a persistent absence of notable price movements. Bitcoin maintains its trajectory within a well-defined range, bounded by an upper limit near the 26,800 level and a lower limit around 26,300.\n\nA closer analysis of the 4-hour timeframe reveals the presence of doji candles followed by candles with limited movement.\n\nThis pattern reflects a prevailing sense of indecision among investors, as they await a compelling fundamental trigger to catalyze a breakout.\n\nNevertheless, the current landscape sees Bitcoin confined within a narrow trading range, lacking a significant catalyst for directional movement.\n\nShould Bitcoin succeed in surmounting the resistance level at 26,600, it can potentially target the subsequent level at 27,350.\n\nNotably, this upside potential finds support in the existence of a triple tap pattern discernible in the 4-hour timeframe.\n\nIt is important to recognize the inherent challenges of surpassing triple tops; however, heightened demand for Bitcoin may serve as a propelling force behind a breakthrough.\n\nIn such a scenario, Bitcoin would encounter further resistance levels at 27,450 and 28,300.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nConversely, a breach below the support level at 26,250 would pave the way for a downside movement, with potential targets at subsequent support levels of 25,900 and 25,400.\n\nConsidering leading and lagging technical indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) exhibit oscillatory behavior within the buying and selling zones.\n\nThis underscores the ongoing indecision prevailing among investors. Moreover, the four-hour candles of Bitcoin demonstrate fluctuations around the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signifying a lack of a clear market direction.\n\nIn light of these technical observations, vigilance is advised at key levels of interest, specifically at 26,750 and 26,250, as they hold the potential to serve as breakout points. While Bitcoin remains ensconced within its current range, consolidation is expected to persist.\n\nHowever, a breakout from this range would present lucrative trading opportunities, irrespective of the direction Bitcoin ultimately follows.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nKeep yourself updated on the latest initial coin offering (ICO) projects and alternative cryptocurrencies by regularly exploring the handpicked collection of the top 15 most promising digital assets to monitor in 2023.\n\nThis thoughtfully curated list has been compiled by industry experts from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, guaranteeing that you have access to professional recommendations and valuable insights.\n\nStay ahead of the curve and uncover the potential of these cryptocurrencies as you navigate the constantly evolving landscape of digital assets.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

        "content": "Meltem Demirors Explains Why the Next Bitcoin Halving \u2018Will Be Different\u2019\n\nAlmost everyone in the crypto community is going into 2020 talking about Bitcoin halving, with many predicting price rises and more market movement. But one expert says that the next halving \u2013 expected to take place in or around May next year \u2013 will be completely different from previous halvings due to increased BTC market \u201cdirectionality.\u201d\n\nMeltem Demirors. Source: a video screenshot, Youtube, Bloomberg Technology\n\nSpeaking on the Unchained Podcast, Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at digital asset management firm CoinShares, stated that there is a \u201cmuch bigger market for Bitcoin\u201d today compared to the last halving, which took place back in July 2016.\n\nWhile there \u201cwas no directionality in the crypto market\u201d in 2016, and investors could \u201conly really go fundamentally long\u201d with their BTC investments, things have now changed.\n\nDemirors claimed,\n\n\u201cThere are [now] bigger firms involved in Bitcoin. So I think that directionality in a much deeper market for Bitcoin is going to change the way people trade around the time of the halving.\u201d\n\nAnd the CoinShares executive said that there were even more favorable market conditions in store for Bitcoin \u2013 with demand rising and supply falling.\n\nShe commented that the fact that \u201cpeople want exposure to Bitcoin in their retirement accounts\u201d and there were now \u201ctens if not hundreds of places where traders can trade [crypto] derivatives\u201d would impact prices when halving effectively reduces the amount of BTC that is left to mine.\n\nDemirors remarked,\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be interesting to see how people trade around the halving \u2013 particularly some of the high-frequency trading firms.\u201d\n\nAs reported, for the most part, expert traders and commentators believe that the market has already taken the 50% reduction in new bitcoins into account when trading. Investors know that 50% fewer bitcoins will be generated each day from May, so they\u2019ve paid a higher rate in the present than they would have if Bitcoin weren\u2019t halving.\n\nHowever, a contrary school of thought argues that the halving isn\u2019t really priced in, either not fully or not at all. Some point out that many casual traders of bitcoin aren\u2019t in fact aware of the halving, so haven\u2019t been paying a higher price for a cryptocurrency that will become harder to obtain next year. For example, looking at Google Trends data for the \u201cbitcoin halving\u201d search term, one can see that searches for the term haven\u2019t come anywhere close to being as popular as they were in July 2016, at the time of the last halving.\n\nAlso as reported, experts working in the sector predict certain developments with some degree of assurance: Bitcoin mining machines will become more advanced and powerful, energy consumption will move increasingly towards renewables, and production costs will be squeezed downwards. Yet on the other, the difficulty of predicting bitcoin\u2019s price makes it correspondingly difficult to predict just how profitable mining will be and whether miners will hoard or sell BTC in anticipation of next year\u2019s halving."

        "content": "How Many People Own & Use Bitcoin in 2022?\n\nSource: Adobe Stock\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, with millions of users and holders across the globe. But how many people actually own or use bitcoin? That\u2019s what we are diving into in this guide. Read on to learn more about the latest bitcoin usage statistics.\n\nBitcoin Adoption Has Been Growing Exponentially Since its Launch\n\nBitcoin was created as a digital peer-to-peer payment network, creating a cheaper and faster way for people to make cross-border payments. Additionally, due to bitcoin\u2019s unique features, including a limited supply and a disinflationary monetary policy, it also established itself as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a popular investment asset.\n\nIn a little over a decade, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization temporarily touched $1 trillion dollars, representing close to 1% of the total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies. It\u2019s no wonder that publicly traded companies, and financial institutions have started adding bitcoin to their balance sheets.\n\nBitcoin mainly came to be appreciated as an investment opportunity that could help diversify an investment portfolio as it has traditionally had limited correlation with assets like stocks and bonds. It also appealed as a great hedge against central bank monetary policies and global economic uncertainty.\n\nOn the back of this, Bitcoin has experienced massive growth since its inception, retaining its dominance as the most traded cryptocurrency in the world since day one.\n\nHow Many People Own Bitcoin in the United States?\n\nThere is no definitive way to determine how many bitcoin users there are due to the pseudonymous nature of the Bitcoin network.\n\nAs a result, we can only estimate how many holders and users there are based on several data points, including the number of wallets created, the number of active wallets, user numbers at leading Bitcoin companies, and third-party research that has used similar methodologies to arrive at an estimate.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at what the numbers say about bitcoin users in the US.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence, a research firm, estimates that there will be more than 25 million bitcoin owners by the end of 2022, a 16.7% growth over last year.\n\nConversely, a survey conducted in 2021 by the New York Digital Investment Group found that roughly 22% of the US adult population, 46 million Americans, own bitcoin. Responses were received from 1,050 participants with incomes above $50,000 and a margin error of 3.1%, which is regarded as statistically significant.\n\nThough another report from the US-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini in 2021 had a larger sample of 3,000 people but estimated only 21.2 million people own cryptocurrencies. In the same report released in 2022, it says one in five people in the US own cryptocurrencies, which implies 20% of the current US population of 332, 403,650. That is 66,480,730 people owning cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe report didn\u2019t specify the cryptocurrencies, but we can reasonably expect that at least 50% hold bitcoin, which is more than 33 million bitcoin owners. The research sample size for the Gemini Crypto 2022 report is 2,300 adults.\n\nJudging by the data points we have collated, we can say that there are probably between\n\nHow Many People in the World Use Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin on-chain data shows there are now more than one billion wallet addresses. But people can have more than one wallet address or keep their bitcoin on centralized custodial exchanges, making it tough to estimate the actual number of people that use bitcoin in the world.\n\nInterestingly, the global crypto exchange Coinbase has over 100 million verified users globally, many of which hold bitcoin.\n\nCrypto analytics company, Intotheblock, reported in May 2022 that the number of addresses holding bitcoin surpassed 40 million.\n\nHow Many People Use Bitcoin Every Day?\n\nThe Bitcoin network currently processes around 250,000 transactions per day and has around 1,000,000 daily active addresses.\n\nBitcoin reached over 330,000 daily transactions in December 2020, and 400,000 in early January 2021.\n\nHow Many People Will Use Bitcoin in the Future?\n\nCrypto.com\u2019s market size report says the number of cryptocurrency owners globally will reach one billion by the end of 2022, with bitcoin likely as the leader of the pack.\n\nThough this forecast was made during a bullish sentiment in the market, and might not happen in 2022, it\u2019s expected that the crypto market will continue to grow in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to envision a future with bitcoin. While the digital currency has already successfully established itself as an investment asset for all types of investors, the growing application of bitcoin as a payment layer (primarily powered by the Lightning Network) could help the digital currency to become a globally used and accepted currency, which could see the number of bitcoin holders and users exceed one billion in the coming decade."

        "title": "Game Theory of Bitcoin Adoption by Nation-States - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Game Theory of Bitcoin Adoption by Nation-States\n\nSource: Adobe/Alexey Napalkov\n\n\u201cEven if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance.\u201d\n\nThe competition \u201cwill most likely be in the form of mining\u201d Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cCountries with the least to lose in terms of monetary sovereignty are more open towards adopting bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIs the race on? This is a question that at least some people have been asking ever since El Salvador made bitcoin (BTC) legal tender in September, and with the Swiss city of Lugano doing essentially the same thing at the beginning of March, it\u2019s arguably only a matter of time before other countries rush to embrace bitcoin.\n\nThis is pretty much the conclusion reached by a recent report from Fidelity Investments, whose analysts Chris Kuiper and Jack Neureuter wrote that countries \u2014 even those that don\u2019t really \u201cbelieve\u201d in bitcoin \u2014 will be \u201cforced\u201d to acquire some sooner or later. As Kuiper and Neureuter argue, this is because the cost of not doing so (when others are creating BTC stockpiles) could be extremely steep.\n\nAnd industry figures speaking with Cryptonews.com largely agree with this analysis, with most affirming that some kind of game theory is at play here. And while they also suggest that a race to acquire bitcoin by nation-states should push the cryptocurrency\u2019s price up massively, they remind that the divisibility of BTC won\u2019t make it too expensive for retail investors and users to acquire for themselves.\n\nGame theory = Worldwide bitcoin adoption?\n\nFidelity\u2019s analysts also cited game theory in their report, noting that history has repeatedly demonstrated that capital always flows where it\u2019s welcomed the most. Basically, any country that nurtures innovation (i.e. by acquiring or adopting bitcoin) will gain an advantage over its peers, who as a result will be compelled to follow suit, for fear of being left behind.\n\nAs they wrote, \u201cWe also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance.\u201d\n\nKuiper and Neureuter also contended that a small cost can be paid by nations today, basically as a hedge against a potentially much larger cost in the future.\n\n\u201cWe therefore wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see other sovereign nation-states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition,\u201d they concluded.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that officials from Lugano may have read this conclusion, with the city\u2019s officials signing a deal early in March with stablecoin issuer Tether to encourage businesses to accept bitcoin (and USDT). Speaking about the deal, Lugano Mayor Michele Foletti\u2019s remarks basically echoed those of Fidelity\u2019s analysts.\n\n\u201cLugano is investing in its future [\u2026] We strongly believe in this technology, the potential to scale the technology [\u2026] will build a better and more open, transparent and smart city,\u201d he said back then.\n\nAnd if you ask pretty much any analyst or figure working within the crypto sector, according to them, there\u2019s a very high probability that other jurisdictions will also turn to BTC and crypto in one way or another.\n\n\u201cCountries that adopt Bitcoin first will advantage their citizenry,\u201d Human Rights Foundation\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer, Alex Gladstein, said.\n\nSamson Mow also agrees with the Fidelity analysts, with the CEO of game developer Pixelmatic also citing game theory in his explanation. (This March, Mow left Bitcoin-focused firm Blockstream, where he served as the chief strategy officer, to focus on \u201cnation-state bitcoin adoption\u201d.)\n\n\u201cThe game theory around Bitcoin will drive nation-states to compete for Bitcoin acquisition and it will most likely be in the form of mining it. The second-order benefit will be that Bitcoin will lead more nation-states to seek energy independence in order to ensure their Bitcoin mining operations are unable to be disrupted by externalities,\u201d he told Cryptonews.com.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s no shortage of people in crypto who are more or less assured that central banks and/or nation-states will have to acquire bitcoin to some extent. For Nigel Green, the CEO and founder of financial consultancy deVere Group, it\u2019s \u201calmost inevitable,\u201d with a growing number doing so in the \u201cnear term.\u201d\n\n\u201cCentral banks, particularly in countries where there are weaker national currencies, will be witnessing in real-time the benefits of owning digital, global currencies in our increasingly tech-driven, globalized world. We can expect them to be running advanced modeling about what would happen to their economies should they fail to move early,\u201d he told Cryptonews.com.\n\nGreen also suggests that recent geopolitical issues, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, will be exacerbating the urgency of this move, particularly as the case for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general is laid bare on a global scale.\n\nHowever, when looking at the process of nation-by-nation adoption, some analysts argue that it won\u2019t be the most developed nations that lead the way.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen with El Salvador, countries with the least to lose in terms of monetary sovereignty are more open towards adopting bitcoin. I believe we will see the \u201cnext Salvador\u201d in Latin America or Africa,\u201d said Trezor Brand Ambassador Josef T\u011btek.\n\nThe second country to make serious moves towards bitcoin adoption may be even more important than the first one, according to T\u011btek, as it will confirm the emerging trend and could add momentum and impetus to the resulting race.\n\nPriced out by nation-states?\n\nWhen exactly this will happen is probably anyone\u2019s guess, although the macroeconomic (and political) instability of the current period may accelerate the overall process, as some commentators suggest.\n\nAnd when it does happen, commentators are generally unanimous in the opinion that the price of bitcoin will skyrocket.\n\n\u201cIf a number of countries begin to compete for Bitcoin holdings, we will see a massive increase in Bitcoin price. Bitcoin in the [USD] 30-40k range is incredibly undervalued,\u201d said Samson Mow.\n\nNo analyst is really willing to give a precise figure, but most say that the rise would be substantial, given how limited the supply of BTC is.\n\n\u201cBitcoin price would likely rise massively, mostly because such purchases would greatly increase bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of everyday people. Bitcoin would graduate from an obscure crypto-anarchic money as it\u2019s still largely perceived now, to a serious monetary asset that everyone should consider,\u201d said Josef T\u011btek.\n\nAs exciting as this might seem for current holders of bitcoin, it raises the possibility that a massive rise in BTC would make the cryptocurrency extraordinarily expensive for \u2018ordinary\u2019 people to acquire. And assuming that it is adopted by nation-states and made legal tender, acquiring it would become necessary.\n\nHowever, experts remind that Bitcoin is highly divisible, meaning it can accommodate huge price rises while still be usable for small transfers.\n\n\u201cAs bitcoin\u2019s are divisible into 100,000,000 \u2018satoshis,\u2019 even when bitcoin hits USD 1 million, satoshis will only cost around USD 0.01. So people can buy 1,000 satoshis for just USD 100,\u201d explained Lou Kerner, CEO of investment firm Blockchain Coinvestors.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s likely that we still have a long road to travel before bitcoin reaches a price of USD 1 million. If it does it all. In either case, it won\u2019t be a smooth ride.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Russia Sanctions Means Countries May Transition to Bitcoin Reserves \u2013 Pantera\u2019s CEO\n\n\u2013 Ukraine War Raises Questions About the \u2018End of Monetary Regime\u2019 and Role of Bitcoin\n\n\n\n\u2013 Panama Eyes Bitcoin & Crypto to Spark Tech Investment\n\n\u2013 BitMEX Boss: El Salvador-style Bitcoin Adoption on the Cards for 5 More Nations\n\n\n\n\u2013 Corporations & Countries Watch and Learn From El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Experiment\n\n\u2013 Argentinian Senate Passes USD 45B IMF Debt Deal That Discourages Crypto Use\n\n\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Mass Adoption Would Benefit and Harm Current Economy}\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Is More \u2018Public\u2019 Money than Central Bank-Issued Fiat Currencies\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin City: The Bizarre History of Libertarian Attempts to Create Independent Cities\n\n\u2013 Why Are People Calling Bitcoin a Religion?\n\n\n\n\u2013 Why Fiat Currency Is More Confusing Than Crypto\n\n\u2013 Technically Capable Bitcoin Has Other Mass Adoption Challenges To Solve\n\n\u2013 How Bitcoin & Crypto Might Help Ease Wealth Inequality (Without Miracles)\n\n\u2013 \u2018Developing Economies\u2019 Tracking El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Moves with Interest"

        "content": "Who Owns the Most Bitcoin? A Closer Look at the Largest Holders\n\nSince launching around 13 years ago, bitcoin has been distributed far and wide to millions of wallets. These Bitcoin wallets are owned by individuals, public companies, private entities, and even governments. Among these holders, a few stand out because of their large bitcoin holdings.\n\nRead on to learn who owns the most bitcoin and how much they own.\n\nWho Owns the Most Bitcoin in the World?\n\nLarge bitcoin holders with 1,000 or more BTC are known as whales. They can be individuals, companies, institutional investors, and even countries. What follows is a list of the entities and individuals that own the most bitcoin.\n\nTop Known Individual Holders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the individuals that hold the most bitcoin.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto (~1.1 million BTC)\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto was not only Bitcoin\u2019s founder but also the first miner to add blocks of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain. He mined approximately 22,000 blocks from January 3, 2009, until he left the project in 2011, acquiring 1.1 million BTC in exchange for his contribution. As of October 12, 2022, this amount is worth over $21 billion. Satoshi\u2019s bitcoin stash is stored across an estimated 22,000 addresses. These coins have never been used except for several test transactions.\n\nThe Winklevoss Twins (70,000 BTC)\n\nAfter settling a dispute with Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg in 2008 for $65 million, the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss amassed a great deal of wealth in crypto assets. They reportedly own 70,000 BTC and have invested in many crypto businesses through their VC firm, Winklevoss Capital. The twins have also invested in other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin and established the crypto exchange Gemini in 2014. They were on Forbes 2022 blockchain and crypto billionaires list.\n\nTim Draper (29,000+ BTC)\n\nVenture Capitalist Tim Draper, known for his early investments in companies such as Skype and Tesla, first purchased bitcoin in 2012. This was followed by a purchase of 29,656 BTC for $18.7 million two years later via a U.S. Marshals\u2019 auction of bitcoin confiscated from the infamous dark web marketplace, Silk Road. Draper may have bought more BTC in the years that followed.\n\nMichael Saylor (17,732 BTC)\n\nMichael Saylor is a well-known Bitcoin maximalist. You\u2019ll often find him publishing bullish Bitcoin tweets or making headlines through his company MicroStrategy, which is constantly buying bitcoin, even during crypto bear markets. On a personal note, however, Saylor reportedly owns at least 17,732 bitcoin. The American entrepreneur revealed his personal bitcoin holdings in a November 2021 interview.\n\nMany other individuals own a lot of BTC but have not publicly disclosed the amounts. For example, this data from River Financial shows six unknown individuals with more than 49,000 BTC in their possession.\n\nSource: River Financial\n\nTop Companies Holding Bitcoin\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the companies that hold the most bitcoin.\n\nPublic Companies\n\nMore than 20 public companies have added bitcoin (BTC) to their balance sheets. Below are the top four holders.\n\nMicroStrategy (130,000 BTC)\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) is a prolific bitcoin buyer. Since making its first purchase in August 2020, the company cannot help but buy more. Based on the purchase history on Buy Bitcoin Worldwide, MicroStrategy has made more than 20 bitcoin purchases, bringing its total holdings to 130,000 BTC as of September 20, 2022. The company may have inspired other public companies to add BTC to their balance sheets.\n\nIn its most recent purchase, MicroStrategy bought 301 BTC in September for $6 million despite the bear market. The average buying price per coin was $30,623. Earlier that month, the company filed to sell $500 million in stock to buy more bitcoin.\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings (40,000 BTC)\n\nGalaxy Digital (GLXY) is a financial services and investment management firm that is also involved in Bitcoin mining. The company has 40,000 BTC in its holdings.\n\nVoyager Digital Limited (12,260 BTC)\n\nVoyager Digital (VYGVQ) may have held 12,260 BTC when it filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. Crypto exchange FTX will acquire the assets of the bankrupt crypto broker after winning a bid in late September 2022. Voyager cited the bear market and Three Arrows Capital\u2019s collapse as the reasons it was filing for bankruptcy. Three Arrows had defaulted on a loan given by one of its subsidiaries.\n\nTesla, Inc. (10,725 BTC)\n\nTesla (TSLA) bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in February 2021 (about 4,200 BTC), causing a flurry of excitement in the crypto space. The company\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, tweeted \u201c#bitcoin,\u201d a post that resulted in a 17% surge in the digital asset\u2019s price. Tesla also revealed plans to accept bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nNevertheless, the excitement of this news was short-lived because a few months later, Tesla suspended car purchases using BTC. It said it would resume BTC payments once Bitcoin mining with renewable energy reached 50%. Moreover, it sold 75% of its bitcoin holdings during the 2022 crypto bear market adding $936 million to its balance sheet. This move was contrary to Musk\u2019s 2021 tweet saying: \u201cTesla will not be selling any Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nOther public companies that own bitcoin are Coinbase Global, Argo Blockchain PLC, Hut 8 Mining Corp, and Bitfarms Limited, among others.\n\nPrivate Companies\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the largest known bitcoin holders among private companies.\n\nMt. Gox (141,686 BTC)\n\nMt. Gox was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges. It was launched in 2010 and handled 70% of all global Bitcoin transactions by the time it ceased operations in early 2014. The Japanese exchange was a victim of several hacking attacks that led to the loss of users\u2019 funds. The exchange filed for bankruptcy in April 2014.\n\nA September 2022 announcement revealed that Mt. Gox clients are close to receiving a $3 billion bitcoin payout that will redistribute stolen funds. The now-defunct company reportedly holds 141,686 BTC.\n\nBlock.one (140,000 BTC)\n\nBlock.one is the company behind the cryptocurrency EOS (EOS). The company was sued by investors in 2020, alleging its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was a securities sale. It is also facing resistance from the EOS community, which believes the company is no longer working toward the network\u2019s best interest. Block.one still owns 140,000 bitcoin.\n\nThe Tezos Foundation (17,500 BTC)\n\nThe Tezos Foundation is a Swiss-based entity that supports the Tezos protocol and ecosystem. It reportedly holds approximately 17,500 BTC.\n\nCountries & Governments\n\nSome of the notable countries and governments that have reportedly accumulated bitcoin holdings include the Ukraine government (46,351 BTC), El Salvador (2,381 BTC), Finland (1,981 BTC), and Georgia\u2019s government (66 BTC).\n\nTop 3 Largest Bitcoin Wallets\n\nAt the time of writing, over 900,000 addresses held 1-1,000,000 BTC balances, according to BitInfoCharts\u2019 Bitcoin Rich list .\n\nAs you can imagine, few addresses hold extremely large amounts of the digital currency. For instance, there were only five addresses with BTC balances ranging from 100,000 -1,000,000. These addresses account for 4.32% of the bitcoin in circulation. As the bitcoin amount drops to 10,000, 1,000, 100, and 10, the number of addresses holding these balances increases, as shown in the table below.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nBinance and Bitfinex have the largest Bitcoin wallets. One Binance cold wallet holds 252,597 BTC, while the other has 143,314 BTC. On the other hand, Bitfinex\u2019s cold wallet contains 168,010 BTC. The crypto exchanges may not necessarily own all these coins because they also hold users\u2019 Bitcoin deposits. The three wallets contain 2.9% of Bitcoin\u2019s total circulating supply. As of October 13, 2022, there were 19,177,431 BTC coins in circulation.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nThe total number of Bitcoin wallets is around 200 million, but this doesn\u2019t exactly reflect the number of Bitcoin owners, as one person or entity could own more than one wallet.\n\nFinal Words\n\nAs a new or current Bitcoin investor, it\u2019s important to remember that the largest holders have accumulated their Bitcoin portfolios over time and may have had large amounts of capital at their disposal.\n\nThey may also have had the advantage of being early adopters, having had the opportunity to buy a lot of bitcoin for a comparatively small amount of money in the early years of Bitcoin. So if you are looking to build a large investment position in bitcoin, it\u2019s ok to take your time and remember to never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\n\n"

        "title": "Is It Time To Begin Talking Seriously About Bitcoin Tail Emissions? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Is It Time To Begin Talking Seriously About Bitcoin Tail Emissions?\n\nSource: AdobeStock / miomio13\n\nIt\u2019s almost a truism that Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s major selling point is its hard supply cap, limiting its total possible circulation to BTC 21 million. However, contrary to this received wisdom, there seems to be a growing chorus of people who worry that a hard cap isn\u2019t without its problems, and that Bitcoin will run into difficulties when its block rewards become too small (and later stop completely).\n\nA recent surge in discussion about this issue was incited by developer Peter Todd, who in July published a paper titled, \u201cSurprisingly, Tail Emission Is Not Inflationary.\u201d Basically, Todd noted that \u201cno proof-of-work (PoW) currency has ever operated solely on transaction fees,\u201d and that the lack of rewards may make block production unstable in the future.\n\nGiven how well respected Peter Todd is within cryptocurrency circles, many other serious commentators have taken his arguments as the launchpad for an exploration of whether Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy needs to be modified in the not-too-distant future. And there does seem to be support for the introduction of so-called tail emissions, even if this support isn\u2019t unanimous.\n\nMixed support for Bitcoin tail emissions\n\nIt\u2019s not too hard to find industry figures who\u2019d support the introduction of tail emissions, which in practice means that block rewards would continue indefinitely. In other words, Bitcoin\u2019s famed hard cap of 21 million would effectively be abolished, although it\u2019s likely that any perpetual reward would be small.\n\n\u201cI have been very vocal for two years already, about needing tail emissions at some point in time in Bitcoin. These tail emissions will only be necessary after four or five halvings, so in about 15-20 years,\u201d says Dr. Julian Hosp, the CEO and founder of Cake DeFi.\n\nHosp argues that most Bitcoin hardliners either don\u2019t understand the need for tail emissions, or are burying their heads in the sand in order to maintain the simple \u2014 and attractive \u2014 narrative of the supply cap.\n\nOf course, many people who\u2019d oppose tail emissions would insist that they do understand Bitcoin\u2019s monetary system, and that even so, they don\u2019t think tail emissions are necessary, at least not for a long time.\n\n\u201cGenerally I welcome the discussion around Bitcoin\u2019s long-term viability. But I believe the block subsidy will be sufficient for the next couple of halving eras (so well into the 2030s), after which ideas such as changing Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy may be more pressing than they are today,\u201d says Trezor Brand Ambassador Josef Tetek.\n\nFor Tetek, any attempt to change the issuance limit of BTC 21 million \u201cwill fail,\u201d largely because it\u2019s a \u201ccrucial part of Bitcoin\u2019s DNA.\u201d For others, seeking to change the cap isn\u2019t necessarily doomed to fail, but would almost certainly be a protracted and contentious process.\n\n\u201cSuch a protocol change, which would change Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental economics and can be implemented only by a hard fork, will be a long and difficult process for the bitcoin community to reach consensus on,\u201d says Nishant Sharma, the founder of BlocksBridge, a consulting and advisory firm for the bitcoin mining industry.\n\nBasically, the fundamental point is that Bitcoin and its advocates have spent so long championing the cryptocurrency based on its cap, that performing a U-turn now may involve something like a paradigm shift.\n\n\u201cI think that it will be challenging to make an effective argument for bitcoin tail emissions. Much of the adoption of bitcoin was made from an argument that the mining schedule would fall off a cliff,\u201d says developer Bryan Bishop.\n\nOther figures simply refuse to be drawn into the debate, with one Bitcoin developer (who prefers to remain unnamed) replying to Cryptonews.com by suggesting that our questions are all \u201cquite speculative,\u201dand that \u201cno one knows at this point in time\u201d as to where monetary policy may end up.\n\nTransaction fees alone\n\nAt the core of arguments that a tail emission is needed is the sub-argument that transaction fees alone won\u2019t be enough to support Bitcoin and the mining it depends on.\n\n\u201cTransaction fees may be enough, but that would mean that fees would go up dramatically over time. I would rather see a super tiny amount of inflation and low transaction fees, than fees alone having to pay for the security provided by miners,\u201d suggests Julian Hosp.\n\nCasual observers may assume that Bitcoin developers would be strictly opposed to tail emissions. However, Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop also works on his own experimental digital currency Webcash, and in the latter\u2019s case he admits that he\u2019s considering adding inflation at the end of its supply schedule.\n\nAccording to Bishop, such inflation is intended to \u201c(1) allow people to continue mining, and (2) to pay for the server expenses or other operational costs.\u201d\n\nThat said, Webcash isn\u2019t a direct analog to Bitcoin, since \u201cmining doesn\u2019t secure the network, so there\u2019s much less danger to this sort of alternative architecture,\u201d Bishop adds.\n\nOther commentators argue that transaction fees would be enough to secure Bitcoin, and that expense base layer fees would be offset by increasing adoption of layer-two networks such as Lightning.\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin adoption spreads around the world, onchain transactions will likely become in high demand and the transaction fees will rise accordingly. That, however, doesn\u2019t mean that ordinary users will be priced out \u2014 it\u2019s more likely that most of Bitcoin\u2019s economic activity will happen on further layers such as the Lightning Network, with Bitcoin\u2019s base layer (blockchain) serving the role of ultimate settlement,\u201d says Josef Tetek.\n\nThis is also more or less the view taken by Nishant Sharma, who essentially argues that a rising BTC price will make transaction fees more viable.\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin\u2019s usage continues to increase, the transaction fees earned by miners will likely grow inversely in relation to the decreasing block rewards. Additionally, if the market sentiment continues to drive bitcoin\u2019s price up, it would increase both the income streams for miners,\u201d he tells Cryptonews.com.\n\nSet in stone?\n\nGiven these mixed views, it\u2019s likely that the future will be determined more by practice than by predetermined decisions.\n\nThat is, if the Bitcoin network becomes relatively insecure or unstable in the future as a result of the drying up of block rewards, then more people will come around to the idea of tail emissions. If it doesn\u2019t, and if transaction fees emerge as sufficient, then the weight behind a shift in monetary policy will likely be negligible.\n\nYet for some, there\u2019s no chance of a change, and no desire right now to entertain the possibility of one.\n\n\u201cI think Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy is truly set in stone at this point and any attempt to change it will be met with an opposition stronger than 2017\u2019s blocksize war. I will definitely be among those running a full node enforcing the 21 million limit,\u201d says Josef Tetek.\n\nOn the other hand, miners carry the biggest influence in Bitcoin, and if a big enough majority supports a shift, then a shift will occur, with Bitcoin splitting (again) into two.\n\nAs Nishant Sharma concludes,\n\n\u201cWith both Bitcoin and bitcoin mining becoming increasingly institutional, the discourse around such proposed changes will change and we may see protocol changes that were unthinkable in the past.\u201d\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Novogratz Doubts Bitcoin Will Pass USD 30,000 Barrier Soon\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Could Fall to USD 13.6K This Year, Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again\n\n\n\n\u2013 Q2 Saw Over 59% of Bitcoin Mining on Sustainable Energy Mix \u2013 Bitcoin Mining Council\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Miners in Q2 Sold 660% of What they Sold in Q1 \u2013 Report\n\n\n\n\u2013 5 Ways to Earn Sats in the Bitcoin Lightning Network Economy\n\n\u2013 As Bitcoin Scales With Lightning Network, What Role Does Litecoin Have to Play?\n\n\n\n\u2013 Report on Lightning Network-Powered DeFi and NFTs Dismissed Even by Bitcoin Advocates\n\n\u2013 The Words We Use In Bitcoin: Words, Language, Terminology, and Linguistic Attacks"

        "title": "How Will Bitcoin Halving Affect Its Security? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "How Will Bitcoin Halving Affect Its Security?\n\nAltcoiners say that due to Bitcoin halvings the security of the network will drop. \u201cBitcoin could run today with one-tenth of the mining power and be very very secure without any problems.\u201d\n\nSource: iStock/ranplett\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the most secure cryptocurrency with the most secure blockchain, remind the legions of Bitcoiners who argue that the cryptocurrency\u2019s increasing hashrate is enough to ensure that it never succumbs to a 51% attack.\n\nHowever, skeptics argue that Bitcoin\u2019s halving block rewards put this much-fabled security at risk. By reducing the quantity of new BTC given to those who mine the cryptocurrency, there will be less financial incentive to maintain the Bitcoin network\u2019s high hashrate, in theory making 51% attacks more feasible.\n\nNonetheless, other commentators believe that the increasing value of transaction fees will be enough to ensure Bitcoin\u2019s security. Because even with declining (or non-existent) block rewards, Bitcoin\u2019s rising value and adoption would mean that the rewards accruing from transaction fees will incentivize mining, they say.\n\nThe pessimistic view of Bitcoin security\n\nIt\u2019s already common knowledge that Bitcoin\u2019s next halving will take place this May, when the reward for being the first to confirm a block will be reduced from BTC 12.5 to 6.25. After this, the next halving will take place after another 210,000 blocks have been mined, and so on, until Bitcoin\u2019s supply cap of BTC 21 million has been reached in around 120 years.\n\nThe next three halvings will reduce the block rewards down to BTC 3.125, 1.56250000 and then 0.78125000. According to Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, CEO of AVA Labs, the developer of the AVA blockchain, such reductions will be enough to seriously weaken Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cAs the amount of awards given to the miners dwindles down, the security of the network will drop,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the security drops sufficiently, we may even see massive double-spend attacks targeting exchanges. This would, in turn, trigger exchanges to extend their confirmation times. At some point, the attackers might have access to so much hashpower that no reasonable number of confirmations may be sufficient to guarantee security.\u201d\n\nSirer adds, \u201cI give Bitcoin at most 3 more halvings, that is 12 years, before the rewards given to the miners drop to the point where intervention is necessary.\u201d\n\nAs reported, he argues that removing Bitcoin\u2019s supply cap would solve this.\n\nThe optimistic view of Bitcoin security\n\nOn the face of it, Sirer\u2019s argument looks plausible \u2013 block rewards are unquestionably getting lower, and after 30 halvings they will be reduced to nothing.\n\nStill, other people in the industry argue that transaction fees will be more than enough to incentivize Bitcoin mining. Kraken\u2018s director of business development, Dan Held, is one of these.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen Bitcoin\u2019s subsidy decrease dramatically through halvenings, we\u2019ve seen the block reward [new BTC and transaction fees] grow to exponentially higher levels,\u201d he tells Cryptonews.com.\n\n\u201cAnd as the block reward value grew massively, we\u2019ve seen transaction fees as a percentage of the block reward continue to grow as well, demonstrating that long term security should be fine with only transaction fees.\u201d\n\nBy both \u201cblock reward,\u201d Held is referring to newly minted BTC and transaction fees. And according to data from Coin Metrics, the amount paid daily in USD in transactions has been rising over the long term.\n\nSource: Coin Metrics\n\nAs reported, Bitcoin all-time cumulative transaction fees hit a symbolic amount of USD 1 billion recently. At the same time, Bitcoin all-time miner revenue (transaction fees plus block rewards) reached USD 15 billion.\n\nIn July 2016 (when the previous halving took place), the total value of all Bitcoin transactions for a single day of confirmations was only USD 30,700. On March 12, 2020, this figure was roughly USD 192,200. However, it\u2019s still small compared with block rewards.\n\nMiners Revenue\n\nTotal value of coinbase block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners.\n\nSource: Blockchain.com\n\nSo block rewards are still highly important to miners, but the point is that transaction fees as a percentage of total block rewards are growing, as Dan Held suggests. Moreover, if Bitcoin gains wider adoption, and if its price rises, the value of fees will increase.\n\nGeorge Agathangelou, the chief marketing officer at blockchain credential firm Block.co, agrees with Held\u2019s analysis. He believes that Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate will continue to rise even with declining block rewards.\n\n\u201cIn my view, the long-term reduction in block rewards will not undermine Bitcoin\u2019s security if the current trend in the Bitcoin hashrate continues to rise,\u201d he tells Cryptonews.com.\n\n\u201cWe do notice that significant investments in mining farms are being allocated around the world, while at the same time the hardware performance of mining rigs is also increasing. As a result, I would expect that the hashrate will continue to rise in the future and that Bitcoin\u2019s security will keep on rising despite the block rewards reduction.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos stressed on multiple occasions that even if the number of miners would drop by 50%, the miners who stick around and wait for the mining difficulty re-targeting, would be twice as profitable afterwards: \u201cThat is a pretty good incentive to stick around.\u201d\n\nAlso, according to Antonopoulos, \u201dBitcoin could run today with one-tenth of the mining power and be very very secure without any problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know? Well, we had one-tenth of the mining power year and a half ago. It was very very secure then. So nothing really happens when the block subsidy runs out, nothing really happens when the halving happens, nothing happens if a bunch of miners turn off their equipment other than a slight delay in block issuance which then gets adjusted in less than two weeks. This is a dynamic system that is constantly adapting to change,\u201d he said at the end of 2019.\n\nBitcoin mining profitability vs. hashrate\n\nSource: bitinfocharts.com\n\nAdoption = Security\n\nThe bottom line is that, if Bitcoin continues to enjoy increasing adoption, its security will rise in parallel. If not, it may be in trouble.\n\nAs Dan Held explains, fees are \u201cdirectionally proportional to both the value of the network and usage. In other words, the block reward [newly minted BTC and fees] equilibrates towards adoption. There isn\u2019t a situation in which there is a disconnect as participants in this game are only financially incentivized (there is no altruism).\u201d\n\nGeorge Agathangelou agrees. \u201cAs long the price of bitcoin is above the average cost to mine a bitcoin, there will always be incentives to enter the market as a miner.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMining hardware break-even price"

        "content": "The Canadian Bitcoin mining firm, Hut 8, has secured a $50 million credit facility from Coinbase Credit, a subsidiary of the US-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. The facility will be used for general corporate purposes and will be backed by bitcoins held by the exchange.\n\nHut 8 announced the development today (Monday), noting that the agreement involves its subsidiary, Hut 8 Holdings, as the borrower.\n\nHut 8\u2019s New Credit Facility\n\nAccording to the statement, the facility comprises a $15 million term loan expected to be funded at or after closing the deal. Moreover, the credit facility provides an option to get an additional $20 million in delayed draw term loan tranche in a second borrowing between one and two months after the deal has been closed.\n\nFurthermore, Hut 8 has the option of accessing an additional $15 million delayed draw term loan tranche in a third borrowing within 15 business days after the completion of the previously announced merger between Hut 8 and US Data Mining Group, also known as US Bitcoin.\n\nKeep Reading Broadridge Boosts Derivatives Trading with New Platform for Institutional Clients\n\nHut 8 and US Bitcoin merged in February in a deal that resulted in one of the largest North American crypto mining companies.

We review five leading crypto watch sites that offer the ultimate customer experience.\n\n1. Crypto Emporium \u2013 Overall Best Place to Buy Luxury Watches\n\nWhen assessing where to buy watches with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u2013 look no further than Crypto Emporium. Established in 2018, Crypto Emporium is a crypto-only retailer that lists thousands of products, including watches. It offers a huge selection of watches to suit all budgets, with prices ranging from $240 to over $600,000.\n\nCrypto Emporium lists more than 17 luxury watch designers, this means you can buy a Rolex with Bitcoin, as well as a whole range of other brands including Jack Mason, Omega, Hublot, Gucci, and Cartier. Others include Richard Mille, Patek Phillippe, and Longines. The highest-priced timepiece available is a Rolex Daytona Rainbow Pave Factory. This retails for over $690,000.\n\nThen there\u2019s a Richard Mille RM-011 FM \u2018Felipe Massa\u2019 Asia Exclusive 50 Limited at $611,000. Looking for a luxury watch for under $150,000? Consider a Patek Philippe Nautilus Chronograph White, which retails for $130,000. At the other end of the scale, there are also watches that sell for under $1,000.\n\nThis includes a Jack Mason Pursuit Chronograph, Test Watch by Olga, and a Citizen Eco-Drive Chandler. When browsing the many watches listed by Crypto Emporium, there is a range of filters to make the process seamless. Buyers can filter by the brand, condition (e.g. new, good, etc.), and price.

Although Prestigetime is based in New York, it also delivers internationally. Just like Crypto Emporium, delivery fees depend on the type of watch and the location of the buyer.\n\nNonetheless, this is one of the best places to buy entry-level luxury watches. For instance, it offers nearly 50 Tag Heuer watches for under $10,000. Prices start at $1,290, which is for the Tag Heuer Formula 1 Quartz 41mm. With that said, Prestigetime also sells luxury watches for those on a much higher budget.\n\nFor instance, a Hublot Big Bang UNICO 42mm 441.JY.4909.RT Yellow Sapphire can be purchased for just over $93,000. A Hublot Big Bang UNICO 42mm 441.ox.1118.LR.0999 is retailing for $75,000, while a DeWitt Academia Quantieme Perpetual GMT Nebula costs almost $60,000. Other popular watch brands include Rolex, Omega, and Cartier.\n\nHowever, Prestigetime does not list any watches by Richard Mille or Patek Phillippe. Moreover, ultra-luxury collectors will not find any watches for over $100,000. Another drawback of Prestigetime is that its website is a bit outdated. This makes it challenging to find the perfect watch, as filters are limited.\n\n3. Breitling \u2013 Mid-Range Luxury Watches With NFT Ownership\n\nBreitling is a luxury watch brand that is renowned for timeless quality. This luxury watchmaker is popular with collectors that seek mid-range timepieces. The vast majority of watches are in the $20,000 \u2013 $60,000 range.\n\nAt the higher end, this includes Premier B21 Chronograph Tourbillon 42 Willy, which retails at $57,000. Then there\u2019s a Navitimer 1959 Edition at just under $40,000. There are also luxury watches for under $10,000. This includes a Chronomat B01 42 ($9,750) and a Premier B01 Chronograph 42 ($9,100).\n\nAnother reason to choose Breitling each watch comes with its own NFT. This makes the process of transferring ownership of the watch seamless, as it simply requires a transaction on the blockchain. The main drawback with Breitling is that it does not list other luxury watch brands.\n\n4. Timepiece Bank \u2013 Huge Selection of Rolex Watches\n\nTimepiece Bank is a traditional watch store that was launched in 2004. In addition to fiat money, the platform also supports crypto. In fact, Timepiece Bank has partnered with BitPay, so plenty of cryptocurrencies are supported. This includes some of the best meme coins, such as Dogecoin. We found that Timepiece Bank is one of the best online stores to buy a Rolex.\n\nThis is because entry-level buyers will find Rolex watches from just \u20ac6,950. This is for a Rolex Oyster Perpetual that has never been worn. But it can\u2019t be sold as new as it has previously been taken out of the box. Those with a slightly higher budget will find a range of Rolex Datejust models, which retail for \u20ac10,750.\n\nThe most expensive Rolex watch offered is a Cosmograph Daytona at \u20ac165,000. In addition to Rolex, Timepiece Bank lists dozens of other luxury watch brands. This includes everything from Bulgari and Gucci to Hublot, Richard Mille, and Patek Philippe. All luxury watches come with a minimum warranty period of two years.\n\nCustomer service is offered via email and Whatsapp. Finally, Timepiece Bank offers a 14-day refund policy on the proviso the watch hasn\u2019t been used or damaged.\n\n5. Jomashop \u2013 Multi-Product Store With Luxury Watches\n\nJomashop is another option to consider when exploring how to buy watches with Bitcoin. This option is suited for watch collectors with an unprecedented budget. This is because Jomashop sells watches that are worth several million dollars. For example, the PATEK PHILIPPE Grand Complications Hand Wind Blue Dial Men\u2019s Watch 6300G-010 retails for $7.6 million.\n\nWhile a RICHARD MILLE Tourbillon Pablo Mac Donough Black Dial Watch RM 53-01 sells for $1.2 million. One of the best watches for under $1 million is the ROLEX Rainbow Sapphire Daytona Chronograph Automatic Chronometer Diamond Black Dial Unisex Watch 116595 RBOW-0001, retailing for $775,000.\n\nLooking for something under $2,000? If so, Jomashop has a huge range of Tag Heuer watches, both new and pre-owned. Jomashop is a multi-product store, as it offers other items in addition to luxury watches. This includes sunglasses, fragrances, jewelry, and handbags. As such, Jomashop offers some of the best things to buy with Bitcoin.\n\nWhy Buy a Watch With Crypto?\n\nDiscussed below are some of the key benefits when electing to buy luxury watches with Bitcoin.\n\nSafety\n\nUsing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to buy luxury watches is extremely safe. This is because payments are made externally, on a wallet-to-wallet basis. The transaction will be posted to the blockchain, ensuring full transparency.\n\nThis safety net is in contrast to traditional payment methods. After all, it is far from safe to enter credit card details for a high-value purchase.\n\nLow Transaction Fees\n\nAnother thing to consider when exploring how to buy watches with Bitcoin is transaction fees. Irrespective of how much is being sent, crypto transaction fees are not based on the transaction size.\n\nFor instance, the same fee will be applicable when sending $100 and $1 million worth of Bitcoin. This is ideal for buying high-value watches online.\n\nCash Out Without a Bank\n\nLooking to sell some Bitcoin, but don\u2019t want to go through a bank? If so, buying a luxury watch is a great way to achieve this goal.\n\nAfter all, the transaction can be completed in a matter of minutes, and buyers can select a luxury watch to meet their goals.\n\nThe watch can then be stored long-term as an investment product. Just remember that buying a watch with Bitcoin will still be classed as a taxable event in most countries.\n\nDiversification\n\nWhile many collectors buy watches as fashion accessories, others do so for investment reasons. This is because luxury watches will often appreciate in value, similar to real estate.\n\nAs such, this offers a great way to diversify away from the crypto space and into another alternative investment market. Recent estimates suggest that luxury watches will increase by 69% every decade.\n\nBut this will ultimately depend on the specific timepiece. For instance, the same study suggests that Rolex is the most reliable watch to buy as an investment.\n\nCashback\n\nWhen discussing where to buy watches with Bitcoin, we mentioned that Crypto Emporium offers cashback on all purchases. This amounts to 4% of the purchase amount, which is huge.\n\nFor example, buying a $10,000 watch would yield $400 in cashback. The cashback is paid 30 days after buying a watch and paid in digital tokens via a crypto giveaway.\n\nIs it Safe to Use Bitcoin When Buying Watches?\n\nAs discussed above, buying watches with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is extremely safe. This is because the payment is made from a private wallet. Just like depositing funds into a crypto exchange, the wallet\u2019s private keys are never shared with the watch store.\n\nHowever, it is important to choose carefully when assessing where to buy watches with Bitcoin. After all, not all watch stores are legitimate. On the one hand, there are estimated watch stores like Crypto Emporium, which has been in business since 2018.\n\nFurthermore, Crypto Emporium is a crypto-only watch store, as it is a specialist in processing blockchain transactions. However, we also came across crypto watch stores that appear to be scams. As such, watch buyers should do some due diligence on the store before proceeding.\n\nFull Guide on How to Buy a Watch With Bitcoin\n\nReady to buy a watch with Bitcoin? Below, we offer a full step-by-step walkthrough on how to buy a watch with Crypto Emporium.\n\nStep 1: Open an Account\n\nFirst, visit the Crypto Emporium website and click on \u2018Create Account\u2019.

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction as BTC Rebounds from Recent Bottom \u2013 Where is the Next BTC Target?\n\nBitcoin has made a significant recovery from its recent low point of $26,600, now trading slightly above $27,000.\n\nThis upward movement has sparked speculation regarding its next potential target.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s price has experienced an upward movement, prompting speculation about its future trajectory.\n\nWith various factors at play, including market sentiment, technical indicators, and macroeconomic conditions, determining the next BTC target requires a comprehensive analysis.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the current market trends and examine potential scenarios for Bitcoin\u2019s price movement.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nThe current price of Bitcoin stands at $27,114, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $8.3 billion.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a slight decline of approximately 0.50%.\n\nWith a live market cap of $525 billion, Bitcoin holds the top rank (#1) on CoinMarketCap.\n\nIt currently has a circulating supply of 19,392,350 BTC coins, with a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins.\n\nIn the current technical analysis of Bitcoin, there is a slight bullish sentiment as it rebounds from the support level around $27,000.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has been trading within a sideways range, with a lower boundary around $27,000 and an upper boundary around $27,350.\n\nA breakout from this range is anticipated to drive further price movement.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nXRP holders' attorney John Deaton poses an interesting question to his over 276,300 Twitter followers on the Bitcoin price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe asked whether they believed Bitcoin's market cap might someday reach half that of Gold. Deaton noted that if this occurs, the price of Bitcoin may increase to $300,000, which would be almost 10 times higher than its present value.\n\nDo you believe #Bitcoin will reach 1/2 the market cap of #Gold one day?\n\n\n\nIf it does, the price would reach 300K. That's 10X from today's price. \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 24, 2023\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of one Bitcoin was $30,672. The CryptoLaw founder added that he decided to go with the forecast that Bitcoin might attain half of Gold's market cap due to his belief that the current price is an attractive entry point for long-term investors.\n\nHe added that the fact that Larry Fink, BlackRock's CEO, made a 180\u00b0 turn regarding BTC says a lot. Over 600,000 customer inquiries about Bitcoin were made on the BlackRock website, according to the CEO of BlackRock. Deaton maintains that this is important.\n\nThe market experienced a jump last week as cryptocurrency investors quickly turned from pessimistic about regulations to optimistic about a prospective Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nThis 180-degree turn may have been caused in part by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world with over $10 trillion in assets. The likelihood that a Bitcoin spot ETF might be achieved has been revived by BlackRock's great track record of having 575 out of 576 ETF applications approved.\n\nOver $1.4 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum were withdrawn from centralized exchanges (CEX) last week, according to IntoTheBlock. Following the BlackRock Bitcoin spot ETF application, the cryptocurrency market saw a resurgence in buying activity as the market chose to aggressively respond in favor.\n\nGold prices increased with launch of spot ETF\n\nIn a blog post, IntoTheBlock examines how approving a spot ETF affected Gold prices. It stated that after the spot ETF's launch in 2003, Gold outperformed the majority of other global assets in the years that followed.\n\nThe price of Gold grew by 27% in the first year following the ETF's debut, by 172% in five years and by 369% in 10 years.\n\nOn-chain analysis by IntoTheBlock indicates that large players appear to have returned in response to the possibility of a Bitcoin spot ETF and increased TradFi participation.\n\nLarge-holder inflows also attained yearly highs subsequently, as the amount of Bitcoin added to addresses that owned 0.1% or more of the supply increased by the most in 2023."

        "content": "As US Seized Gold in 1933, Is There a Threat to Bitcoin in the 2020s?\n\nIn 1933, the US banned the hoarding of gold and ordered citizens to deliver their gold to the Fed. While it\u2019s more difficult to ban crypto, just remember \u2013 not your keys, not your coins.\n\nA fragment of the Executive Order 6102. Source: Wikipedia\n\nA sharp global recession seems to be inevitable. Could the US or any other government shut down crypto exchanges or ban the ownership of cryptoasset?\n\nAt first glance, this seems like an extreme and unlikely scenario. However, figures within the crypto industry believe that it could become a real possibility if, in the US case, USD suffers severe inflation during a long recession.\n\nBy closing exchanges and custodian services, the US government would attempt to limit the number of people exchanging increasingly devalued USD for bitcoin (BTC) and other coins.\n\nHowever, while there\u2019s an outside chance that the US government might move to close exchanges and ban the ownership of crypto, it\u2019s unlikely that any such move would be effective in stopping Americans from holding and trading crypto. That is, so long as they moved their coins off any US-based third-party platforms before the government swooped in. In theory, the same scenario would play out in other countries too.\n\nExecutive Order 6102\n\nOn March 12, Messari founder Ryan Selkis tweeted a warning to his 100,000 followers:\n\nBy \u201cFDR era,\u201d Selkis is referring to former president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. On April 5, 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, which decreed that all US citizens \u201care required to deliver [\u2026] all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates now owned by them to a Federal Reserve Bank, branch or agency.\u201d The hoarding of gold, similar to the stacking sats, was forbidden back then in order to help the Federal Reserve to increase the money supply during the depression. Also, a penalty of USD 10,000 and/or up to five to ten years imprisonment were introduced.\n\nHowever, back then, the Federal Reserve Act still required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued, while today the US dollar is not backed by gold (or BTC for that matter).\n\nIn either case, it seems that Selkis is concerned that the Trump administration would do for cryptoasset what FDR did for gold. And it would seem that a number of other people working within the crypto industry agree with him.\n\nSpeaking to Cryptonews.com, CryptoMondays partner Lou Kerner agrees that the need to limit the impact of crypto hoarding on fiat monetary systems might impel the US government (and possibly other governments) to close down exchanges or even seize crypto.\n\n\u201cThe most popular reason used by governments is to ban the use of cryptocurrencies and the services that support their use is illicit activity,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s broadly believed that governments are most concerned about the impact it could have on their own monetary system if citizens had choice.\u201d\n\nIndeed, other governments have taken harsh restrictive measures against crypto for reasons related to capital controls. Most notoriously, the Chinese government banned crypto exchanges (not BTC) in 2017, largely due to fears over capital flight (i.e. people sending or trading money overseas).\n\nSo it\u2019s certainly not inconceivable that other governments \u2013 including the US government \u2013 could take similar steps if the coronavirus pandemic triggered recession results in a deep depression and high USD inflation. While hyperinflation is not likely in the US, some estimate that the USD may devalue in the next 12 months.\n\nCurrent exchange outflows\n\nGiven that this threat can\u2019t be dismissed, voices within the industry recommend taking crypto off third-party platforms wherever possible.\n\n\u201cNot your keys, not your coins, is a popular phrase because governments can always seize your assets, whether its on a crypto exchange, or at Chase Bank,\u201d says Lou Kerner, who agrees that traders should seek to use their own wallets with their own private keys in order to safeguard their crypto.\n\nIn fact, it would seem that some traders are already beginning to move crypto off of exchanges. As reported, BTC outflow from exchanges has been growing daily since March 18.\n\nLikewise, Coin Metrics recently said that BitMEX has experienced \u201cmass liquidations\u201d since March 13, with its holdings of BTC falling by 22%.\n\nSource: Coin Metrics\n\nIt\u2019s hard to confirm whether this exodus is happening because people fear government action. Asked whether people were preparing for possible closures or seizures, Lou Kerner suggests that the outflows may be caused by a variety of reasons.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of crosscurrents going on at the same time. Hard to know exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. \u201cWhales tend to have their own wallets. So it could be that whales are owning a larger percentage of the coins.\u201d\n\nAnd obviously, with 6.6 million people claiming for unemployment in the United States, it could be that more people are liquidating their crypto in order to put extra USD in their pockets. Marcus Swanepoel, co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Luno, warned recently that in case of a massive global recession even the long-term hodlers may be forced to sell their BTC to survive.\n\n\u2018It largely doesn\u2019t matter\u2019\n\nBut even assuming that, in the worst-case scenario, the US government does attempt to shut down US-based exchanges and prohibit cryptocurrency ownership, will this make a massive difference? Wouldn\u2019t a ban on bitcoin and other cryptoassets be more or less unenforceable?\n\n\u201cGovernments do what they believe is in their best interests,\u201d says Lou Kerner, agreeing that a ban could be a possibility. \u201cI think the important point is that it largely doesn\u2019t matter. China has banned Google and Facebook and Twitter. But they\u2019re still things.\u201d\n\nAgain, in the case of China, the government\u2019s banning of cryptoexchanges hasn\u2019t prevented Chinese people from owning cryptocurrencies and trading them on various platforms, including over-the-counter (OTC). For example, according to a small poll conducted by PANews in October 2019, 8% out of 300 surveyed Chinese students hold some kind of cryptoasset, while 17% in total have held crypto at some point.\n\nSo even if the US government succeeded in shutting down US-based exchanges, US citizens and residents would technically still be able to trade crypto on international, decentralized, peer-to-peer platforms. And even if the government banned ownership of crypto outright, it would still be hard to trace crypto held on private wallets. Moreover, without regulated crypto exchanges that know who their customers are it would be even harder to track crypto owners. (Let\u2019s hope the government won\u2019t get access to a user database on your exchange.)\n\nTo conclude, while it seems that the general consensus is that crypto bans are not 100% effective, it doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t hurt. Just stay vigilant and remember \u2013 not your keys, not your coins.\n\n___\n\nLearn more: Hey, Gov\u2019t Officials! Do You Still Think You Can Ban Bitcoin?"

        "title": "Henry Ford's Energy Standard: A 100-Year Old Bitcoin Prediction - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Henry Ford\u2019s Energy Standard: A 100-Year Old Bitcoin Prediction\n\nOn December 4, 1921, The New York Tribune published a story detailing a plan by inventor Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, to replace the existing gold-backed currency system into one based on an \u201cenergy currency.\u201d\n\nHenry Ford. Source: Wikipedia.org\n\nThis article delves into Ford\u2019s ambitious plan and how Bitcoin (BTC) has come to be the embodiment of a 100-year-old ideal.\n\nA historical background\n\nThe article headlined \u201cFord Would Replace Gold With Energy Currency And Stop Wars\u201d detailed Ford\u2019s beliefs on a number of prevailing issues at the time, with a focus on international monetary policies and how they adversely affected the stability of the world.\n\nFord believed that gold was the basis of war, or rather played a major part in extending the length of wars. In 1921, the effects of the First World war were beginning to become painfully obvious across the globe. Dubbed \u2018The War To End All Wars\u2019, WW1 left over 9 million soldiers and 21 million civilians dead with many injured and others missing.\n\nIt was against the backdrop of a destructive global war that Ford made his remarks and introduced the world to his revolutionary idea.\n\nFord explained the premise of his energy currency succinctly stating:\n\n\u201cThe essential evil of gold in its relation to war is the fact that it can be controlled. Break the control and you stop war.\u201d\n\nCentralized gold power\n\nFord believed there was a centralization of wealth and power among those who held and controlled gold, such that they would be incentivized to further hold on to that power and wealth, whether benevolently or maliciously.\n\nThe prolific businessman stated:\n\n\u201cThere is a group of international bankers who today control the bulk of the world\u2019s gold supply. No matter to what country they as individuals claim allegiance, they all play the same game to keep the gold they have in their own hands and to get just as much more as possible.\u201d\n\nGiven the recently concluded WW1, Ford continued, offering the example of war. \u201cWith the international bankers, the fostering, starting and fighting of a war is nothing more nor less than creating an active market for money, a business transaction. If the different countries of the international groups are at war, that makes no difference. No matter who loses the war, there have been a great many loans \u2013 the gold system always wins. The young men from eighteen to thirty fight the war and are maimed or killed, the internationalists are safe and prosperous.\u201d\n\nWhile the gold standard was eventually abandoned, the idea of the dangers behind centralized wealth holds to this day. Traditional financial institutions with large amounts of money and power can participate in activities that adversely affect the lives of everyday people while facing next to zero consequences.\n\nA currency backed by natural wealth?\n\nFord was attempting to usher in a new dispensation in global monetary policy, where countries would issue currencies backed against their natural wealth, like rivers and the like, instead of issuing currency backed by gold kept in reserves.\n\nFord outlined his idea at the Muscle Shoals Nitrate Plant in Tennessee. He was there to inspect it in the hope that he would be able to acquire it from the government to demonstrate the viability of his plan to the American public and the global community.\n\nThe premise behind the idea was simple, replace currency backed by gold to currency backed by natural wealth.\n\nAt the time the US government was planning to issue bonds to acquire the USD 30m needed to develop a dam. Ford, however, had an alternative idea. He proposed he would build the dam, effectively for free, if the state agreed to issue a currency backed by Muscle Shoals plant.\n\nMuscle Shoals was built on the Wilson Dam. Ford argued that the resource would make for greater security for any currency, given its time-tested robustness. Additionally, the dam created energy, capable of furnishing a significant, if not infinite, amount of horsepower. It was this energy against which the value of the Muscle Shoals Currency would be determined.\n\nFord explained:\n\n\u201cUnder the energy currency system the standard would be a certain amount of energy exerted for one hour that would be equal to USD 1. It\u2019s simply a case of thinking and calculating in terms different from those laid down to us by the international banking group to which we have grown so accustomed that we think there is no other desirable standard.\u201d\n\nIn other terms, Ford was suggesting a currency backed by the energy expended in kilowatt hours (kWh) which would be produced in certain amounts. More units of the currency would only be created if more energy was expended. Ford was ultimately unsuccessful in his ambitious endeavour, citing political pushback, and eventually gave up on the project in 1924.\n\nJust over a hundred years on, however, there now exists a currency based on energy.\n\nEnter Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is supported by a group of parties called miners. Miners input energy to mine new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is what gives BTC its intrinsic value and is referred to as bitcoin energy-value equivalence. In other words, the value of bitcoin can be derived or defined by the raw joules expended to create one.\n\nJoules are a derived unit of energy and work measurement. Work is defined as the force applied to an object over a distance. 1 kWh is equivalent to 3.6 million joules. Given that we can ascertain the energy being utilized in the Bitcoin network, it is possible to compute the value in kWh of one BTC at a certain point in time, taking into account the supply growth rate at that time and the total joules expended. This is how to calculate the value of one bitcoin under this posit.\n\nAdditionally, it would also be true to say that one bitcoin is backed by the total amount of energy ever expended by the Bitcoin network. Given the fact that the network is still minting new units, this amount will keep growing until miners stop generating new coins. However, Bitcoiners hope that because of transaction fees, miners will always be incentivized to participate in the network, even after the last bitcoin is mined around 2140.\n\nIn this way, we can see that it is possible to derive the value of a bitcoin by measuring its energy input. It is also mathematically provable that one bitcoin is backed by total expended energy across the network. Additionally, its decentralized nature means that it can avoid concentrating power in a very small section of the global populace.\n\nIt looks like this makes Bitcoin the embodiment of Henry Ford\u2019s visionary energy standard.\n\n___\n\nLearn more:\n\nBitcoiners Ask: \u2018WTF Happened In 1971?\u2019 The Answer Might Shape The 2020s\n\nCentral Banks\u2019 Renewed Gold Hunger Shows Need For A Hedge\n\nAs US Seized Gold in 1933, Is There a Threat to Bitcoin in the 2020s?\n\nAttempts to Increase Bitcoin\u2019s Supply Would End Up With Another \u201cBitcoin\u201d"

        "title": "Meet Nodeless, The Non-KYC Bitcoin Lightning Processor Jack Dorsey Tweeted About - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nLate last week, Jack Dorsey tweeted a link to Nodeless \u2014and nothing else. Although cryptic, the mention seemed like a stamp of approval for the platform from one of Bitcoin\u2019s most famous backers, sparking buzzy excitement as well as some debate over the merits of the Lightning payment processor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is Nodeless, exactly?\n\nIn short, merchants can add the tool to their website to accept Bitcoin payments more easily. Specifically, it helps with making transactions over the Lightning Network, which offers cheaper and faster payments over Bitcoin and is widely heralded as the most likely method through which Bitcoin will go mainstream.\n\n\"Our goal is to make Bitcoin a medium of exchange by making it as easy as possible for merchants to accept Bitcoin,\" Nodeless's pseudonymous creator UTXO told Decrypt.\n\nStill, using Lightning non-custodially\u2014without a middleman taking control of a user\u2019s funds\u2014can be tricky for newer users.\n\nIn some ways, Nodeless's functionality is similar to OpenNode, another Lightning-based Bitcoin payments provider. But Nodeless offers one key difference: users don't have to share identifying information to begin accepting payments using the platform. In other words, it's a non-KYC (Know Your Customer) service.\n\n\u2018Nodeless\u2019 payments\n\nUsing Lightning non-custodially generally requires a user to run their own Lightning node. This can be tricky for non-technical users or users strapped for time. There are already platforms out there like Voltage or Greenlight, however, which provide a one-click solution for setting up a Lightning node, and where users don't have to maintain the node over time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Nodeless takes a different approach. Nodeless is \"nodeless\" in the sense that a merchant accepting payments doesn't have to run their own Lightning node\u2014which takes time and resources to establish and run, and eats up computational resources.\n\nThere's still a node involved\u2014a node is always involved when sending a Bitcoin or Lightning payment. But instead of a user running their own node, Nodeless's node is the one passing on the payment. When a payment is sent to the merchant, it's sent to Nodeless. Nodeless then immediately sends the payment to the merchant\u2019s on-chain or Lightning address.\n\n\"Technically we custody individual payments for several seconds while the payment is in transit. We believe this is a fair trade-off versus the complexities of running a lightning node,\" UTXO said.\n\nSo, Nodeless is technically a custodial solution in that it holds a user's funds for a minute. But it promises to give it back very quickly. Users provide a Lightning address or cold wallet storage Bitcoin address to which Nodeless will promptly forward the user's funds.\n\nPrivacy money\n\nSome Bitcoiners expressed skepticism about this model, arguing that as the company grows, KYC requirements from governments will get more stringent. Or, since Nodeless is technically a centralized solution, governments could conceivably step in and force the company to stop transactions it doesn't like.\n\nBut UTXO thinks Nodeless can bypass these pressures.\n\nNodeless operates legally in Canada, where transactions under $1,000 don't require KYC identification. In the long-term, they're looking to move to El Salvador, known for its lax measures toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, where UTXO said \"this business is welcomed with open arms.\"\n\n\"I also think [governments will] be more interested in the non-KYC custodians before Nodeless,\" UTXO said.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

Eight years ago, on this day in 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid another Bitcoin talk forum user for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas for the low, low price of 10,000 BTC (worth about USD 25 at the time.) Now, that amount would be worth around USD 80 million.\n\nA fragment of a painting \u201cBitcoin Pizzaday\u201d by Helen Kholin. Source: bit4coin.net\n\nNobody is going to let him forget that. There is a Twitter account @bitcoin_pizza, that only tweets how much those pizzas are worth every day, and how it compares to the previous day.\n\nIs Hanyecz sorry that he didn\u2019t HODL? He said last year in an interview with the New York Times, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.\u201d\n\nAnd today, the whole crypto world celebrates. Searching \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day\u201d on Facebook returns a long list of events all over the globe, marking this momentous occasion.\n\nAlso, some people tweet their own Bitcoin pizzas, like Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange, did. Of course, we\u2019d wager that these are worth significantly less than USD 80 million, but they sport the Bitcoin logo, so it\u2019s close enough.\n\nSome companies are using this day to introduce and advertise new products. Ledger, a cryptocurrency hardware wallet producer, announced that it has \u201cdesigned a limited edition of our Nano S [wallet] to celebrate Laszlo\u2019s historic moment.\u201d\n\nOthers tell you, \u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself the next time you make a bad purchase!\u201d\n\nIn either case, you can look at it from another point of view as well: as Twitter user @marckenigsberg would put it, \u201c8 years later and the price is exactly the same \u2013 10,000 btc. It\u2019s just fiat that\u2019s devalued.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t forget about the altcoins either. Ethereum community in Berlin, ETHBerlin is celebrating D\u00f6ner Kebab ETHBerlin day, presumably not to be outdone by a pizza.\n\nHappy Bitcoin Pizza Day!\n\nAnd now we are really hungry."

The digital asset has been experiencing an upward trend for the past few days, much to the delight of Bitcoiners. Many analysts agree that it is destined for better days. Renowned investor Michael Saylor is among those who believe this and has recently shared the reasons why he believes Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to dominate the cryptocurrency market for a long time.\n\nAs a fervent advocate for the flagship cryptocurrency, Michael Saylor does not hesitate to refute the critics of Bitcoin (BTC). In an interview with CNBC, the co-founder of the analysis and strategic intelligence company MicroStrategy once again predicted a bright future for the queen of cryptocurrencies.\n\nMr. Saylor mentioned certain factors to justify his stance. He first pointed out that Bitcoin (BTC) is endorsed by several US presidential candidates. Indeed, Francis Suarez, Ron DeSantis, and Robert Francis Kennedy, all in the running for the White House, are fervent supporters of cryptocurrencies.\n\nMr. Saylor also highlights the interest of BlackRock, Fidelity, and many other financial giants in Bitcoin. He asserts that these companies are now aware of the strong potential of Bitcoin (BTC) and recognize it as the winning asset.\n\nThe only universally accepted commodity\n\nMichael Saylor also commented on the issue of Bitcoin (BTC) regulation. The investor claims to have read thousands of legal documents related to cryptocurrency regulation. Therefore, he states with full knowledge that the queen of cryptos is the only universally accepted commodity.\n\nFinally, Mr. Saylor asserts that \u201cthe future will bring a parade of positives for those intent on proliferating bitcoin as an instrument of economic empowerment\u201d.\n\nThe American entrepreneur clearly has high hopes for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Recently, Michael Saylor predicted a bitcoin-centric crypto industry (BTC) based on the recent measures taken by the SEC.\n\nL\u2019entrepreneur am\u00e9ricain place visiblement beaucoup d\u2019espoirs dans la plus grande cryptomonnaie par capitalisation boursi\u00e8re. R\u00e9cemment, Michael Saylor a pr\u00e9dit une industrie crypto ax\u00e9e sur le bitcoin (BTC) en se basant sur les r\u00e9centes mesures prises par la SEC.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Want to Buy \u2018Virgin Bitcoin\u2019? Be Ready to Pay 20% More, Says CEO\n\nBuyers of so-called \u201cvirgin bitcoins\u201d are paying up to 20% more for coins with no transaction history, Flex Yan, CEO of Babel Finance, a Hong Kong-based crypto financial services company, claims.\n\nSource: iStock\n\nIn a recent opinion piece, published by Bitcoin Magazine, he said that demand for the virgin coins is growing as \u201cwithout any transactional history, there is essentially no risk of the coins being seized or frozen due to their involvement in questionable past dealings.\u201d According to Yan, the new Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines, that force governments to tighten oversight of the crypto business, have also helped to increase the demand.\n\nVirgin bitcoins can be bought directly from cryptocurrency miners who receive these coins as a reward for mining the Bitcoin blockchain. Therefore, these tokens do not have transaction history. As it\u2019s well known, the Bitcoin protocol is pseudonymous and it is possible to identify a bitcoin owner based on transaction history.\n\nHowever, not only large and reputable bitcoin holders, including institutional investors, are interested in holding \u201cclean\u201d bitcoins in order to be on the safe side. Money launderers and other illicit actors are also competing for these coins.\n\nFor example, Ciphertrace, a cryptocurrency and blockchain tracing and security specialist, said in Q2 Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report that, according to the 2018 indictment of alleged conspirators involved in hacking the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russia funded the purchase of computer infrastructure for their activity in part by mining bitcoin (in other words, by using virgin bitcoins.)\n\n\u201c[Also], there was speculation that the [Iran\u2019s] government real motivation for confiscating the [mining] rigs was to use them to leverage Iran\u2019s vast energy reserves and create clean, virgin BTC, which the government could then use for foreign trade payments\u2014trade based money laundering,\u201d according to Ciphertrace.\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________________\n\nIn order to save Bitcoin\u2019s fungibility, the network needs to see better on-chain privacy measures to make sure the notion of virgin bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist and all bitcoin are freely interchangeable. Bitcoin developers are aware of this issue and are already working on solutions that would increase the anonymity of bitcoin users.\n\nTaproot and Schnorr are two highly anticipated solutions, with the latter already implemented by Bitcoin Cash. The two should be bundled together and activated via a soft fork on the Bitcoin network once development and testing has been successfully completed.\n\nHowever, even those solutions might not be enough to solve the problem, as discussions in the cryptoverse show.\n\nMeanwhile, on the bright side of this issue, some see it as an opportunity to buy bitcoin as a collectible.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say one day Satoshi moves his coin, I will happily pay a premium for it as a collectible,\u201d Dovey Wan, founding partner of crypto investment firm Primitive Ventures, said."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin held by US entities has decreased by 11%\n\nAlmost all of this supply has gone to Asia\n\nAsian regulators could use SEC\u2019s lawsuit as a point of reference\n\nAccording to on-chain data, Asia has surpassed the United States in terms of active capital in Bitcoin and crypto markets.\n\nGlassnode, an on-chain analytics service, announced on June 5 that the gap between US and Asia Bitcoin supplies held or transacted had grown.\n\nA clear divergence is visible in the year-over-year BTC supply change based on geographical regions. The extreme dominance of US entities in 2020-21 has clearly reversed, with US supply dominance falling by 11% since mid-2022. European markets have been fairly neutral over the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5AwNBYK6BZ \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) June 8, 2023\n\nAccording to Glassnode, the year-over-year change in BTC supply by geographical region shows a notable disparity. The US entities\u2019 extreme dominance in 2020-21 has obviously reversed, with US supply dominance declining by 11% since mid-2022. Also, over the last year, European markets have been rather neutral, whereas Asian trading hours have seen a major increase in supply dominance.\n\nThe gap has grown wider as America becomes more hostile to Bitcoin and overall cryptocurrency sector while Asia opens up. \u201cThis is a distinct reversal from the 2020-21 bull cycle,\u201d Glassnode observed.\n\nThe United States\u2019 supremacy began to decline in 2021 and switched negative in mid-2022. This occurred at the same time as the Terra/Luna ecology collapsed and regulatory pressure increased. Since then, the government and federal officials have been on a mission to put an end to the industry through regulatory action.\n\nGlassnode also noticed significant changes in stablecoin supply. Since the beginning of the year, the aggregate stablecoin supply from the top five issuers has decreased by 7.5%, or $10 billion.\n\nA substantial chunk of this fall can be attributed to Circle\u2019s USDC , which was once favored by US financial institutions. In 2023, the USDC supply has fallen by $15.7 billion, or 35%. Circle was also severely harmed as a result of its exposure to the now-defunct Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nWhy Is Southeast Asia a Crypto-Friendly Region?\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency may have started in the G7 (if presumed that Satoshi Nakamoto is Japanese), underdeveloped countries have often been the most enthusiastic about adopting decentralized virtual currencies. The explanation is simple: the promise of financial democratization offered by cryptocurrency has a tremendous appeal in nations where huge segments of the population lack access to key banking services.\n\nIt is no coincidence that Asia\u2019s two greatest developing countries, China and India, have imposed severe sanctions on cryptocurrency while rising Southeast Asia has not. Approximately 80% of individuals in both nations have bank accounts.\n\nIn comparison, up to 70% of Vietnamese, 66% of Indonesians, and 44% of Filipinos are unbanked . Regulators in these countries are, predictably, slower to restrict access to cryptocurrencies than their colleagues in China and India.\n\nAlso, this month, Hong Kong began enabling exchanges to facilitate trading, while in the West, legal proceedings against key exchanges in the United States represented a watershed moment for the industry.\n\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, one of the targets of the SECs legal action, cautioned in an opinion article for MarketWatch that weak regulation would harm the United States.\n\n\u201cIn the 1990s and early 2000s, smart\u2014and tailored\u2014regulation enabled the United States to define the Internet Age,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRegarding Hong Kong, Armstrong stated that China\u2019s drive for the crypto story was \u201cno surprise.\u201d\n\nBe it as it may, some people familiar with the situation believe that US regulatory action against two big cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase and Binance, may serve as a model for Hong Kong and Singapore as they seek to combine expansion with investor safety.\n\nThe revelation has rattled investor confidence just as Hong Kong is attempting to position itself as a trading hub alongside Singapore, which already has such a framework in place.\n\nUS Actions May Be Used as Point of Reference\n\nAccording to experts, the two cities may use the US action as a reference point, which might mean greater inspection of Bitcoin and crypto trades in Asia.\n\nAnndy Lian, Singapore-based author of the book \u201cNFT: From Zero to Hero\u201d said that there would be a fallout for sure.\n\n\u201cHong Kong and Singapore are taking measures to regulate the cryptocurrency industry by proposing new licensing regimes for virtual asset trading platforms,\u201d he said .\n\nThe Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in Hong Kong has asked for an evaluation of a proposal that would urge crypto trading platform operators to get the same licenses as securities traders.\n\nAccording to Lian, other firms that were not applying had been asked to prepare for an orderly closure as well.\n\nSecurities, unlike other financial assets, are heavily regulated and require extensive disclosures to notify investors of potential dangers.\n\n\u201cThese developments indicate that cryptocurrency exchanges seeking approval in Hong Kong and Singapore will have to adhere to new regulatory requirements and may be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators,\u201d Lian concluded.\n\nJulian Hosp, the CEO and co-founder of Cake Group, a fast-growing Southeast Asia\u2019s digital assets innovator, asserted that the war that the US is waging on cryptocurrencies \u201cshows no signs of abating, and it will only intensify as time wears on.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that the regulator\u2019s action is part of a bigger trend that would most likely continue through the 2024 presidential election.\n\nRajagopal Menon, vice-president of WazirX stressed that the SEC\u2019s lawsuit primarily focuses on actions that have taken place in the United States and their impact on American citizens. However, he warned that for regulators in Hong Kong, such as the Securities and Futures Commission, and Dubai\u2019s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, the SEC\u2019s lawsuit could serve as a point of reference or information."

Then check out the Blockchainsareforever.com project. It\u2019s not the best service for private messaging as every single message is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, which means that they are public and can never be modified or deleted.\n\nSource: iStock/vallefrias\n\nThis fun service isn\u2019t that revolutionary, as it has been possible to add messages on the Bitcoin blockchain since its inception. For example, Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, included this message in the Genesis Block, or the first-ever block of Bitcoin: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d Meanwhile, this year, TD Ameritrade, an online broker, planted their literal flag on the Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, effectively making an advertisement for themselves.\n\nHowever, \u201cBlockchains are forever\u201d makes this much easier. Just type in your message, choose whether you want your message to show on the Bitcoin blockchain or testnet, choose your payment method (via the Lightning Network or the regular Bitcoin payment), pay, and voil\u00e1! Your message is \u201cimmortalized.\u201d\n\nThis is what people are sending into eternity:\n\nIt won\u2019t cost you a lot to try \u201cBlockchains are forever\u201d as sending one message is less than 5 US dollar cents. However, you are only allowed to send 80 characters in a single message. So, if you are planning to add a wall of text to the Bitcoin blockchain, be sure to stock up with BTC first.\n\nCryptonews.com covered two similarly creative crypto projects previously. The first one is Steem Whale, which allows you to make an artificial whale fountain squirt by sending the Steem cryptocurrency.\n\nAnother fun project is Satoshi\u2019s Place, a graffiti board to show the power and capabilities of the Lightning Network. There\u2019re one million pixels on the canvas with each costing 1 satoshi to paint. Even if you draw something large, it won\u2019t cost you a lot. But be aware: others can respray your art!\n\nHower, immutability of public blockchains is being used to send serious messages, also. As reported in April, activists have posted a student of Peking University\u2019s #MeToo movement letter on the Ethereum blockchain in an attempt to avoid government censorship."

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving [2024 Update] - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "Have you ever pondered why the value of Bitcoin continues to increase gradually? One of the major causes is a process known as \u201cBitcoin halving\u201d. In this blog post, we will investigate what the Bitcoin halving consists of, why it takes place, and how it influences the crypto market.\n\nShort Summary\n\nBitcoin halving is a process that reduces the rate of new BTC created\n\nPast halving\u2019s have had varying impacts on the market & mining landscape.\n\nAnticipation around the 2024 Bitcoin halving is brewing, but key factors including potential demand changes, regulatory shifts, and miner adaptation strategies should be taken into consideration to better understand the effect on the crypto market as a whole.\n\nContents\n\nBitcoin Halving Explained\n\nEvery four years or every 210,000 blocks the mining reward for validating transactions on the Bitcoin network is halved. As of writing this article, there are 19,412,225 Bitcoins in existence, with a total cap of 21,000,000 Bitcoins that will ever exist. Knowing about Bitcoin halving dates allows investors to gain better knowledge of how it impacts the price of BTC as well as its long-term sustainability.\n\n\n\nHere are a few analogies to better understand this phenomenon:\n\nCake Slice : Imagine a birthday cake that\u2019s cut into pieces for a party. At first, there\u2019s enough for everyone. But as the party goes on, the number of cake slices is halved every hour. As long as guests still want cake, each remaining slice becomes more valuable because there\u2019s less to go around\n\n: Imagine a birthday cake that\u2019s cut into pieces for a party. At first, there\u2019s enough for everyone. But as the party goes on, the number of cake slices is halved every hour. As long as guests still want cake, each remaining slice becomes more valuable because there\u2019s less to go around Apple Farming : The halving of Bitcoin is like an apple farmer reducing his harvest by half each year. As long as demand stays the same or increases, the fewer apples available each year makes each one more valuable.\n\n: The halving of Bitcoin is like an apple farmer reducing his harvest by half each year. As long as demand stays the same or increases, the fewer apples available each year makes each one more valuable. Fishing Limit: It\u2019s like a popular fishing spot suddenly cutting the daily catch limit in half. If demand for fish stays the same, each fish\u2019s value will increase because they\u2019re harder to get.\n\nThe Role of Mining in Bitcoin Halving\n\nMining is a vital component of the Bitcoin halving process. Miners receive BTC as a reward in exchange for authenticating transactions and introducing blocks to the blockchain. The first reward issued was 50 BTC per block, but after the initial halving it got reduced by half.\n\nMiners are responsible for preserving the security of the Bitcoin network. Reductions to supply through halvings boosts scarcity, contributes to value appreciation and slows down coin issuance rate.\n\nScarcity and Inflation Control\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event every four years significantly reduces the amount of new Bitcoins that are released. This gives Bitcoin its status as an asset with limited supply and limits inflationary pressures on its value. People have different views about this design. Some argue that having scarce coins may lead to less people spending their Bitcoins with the expectation their worth will rise over time. Others recognise how Bitcoin is different from traditional currencies managed by central banks in which purchasing power declines over time due to inflation.\n\nA Timeline of Past Bitcoin Halvings\n\nWe can travel back in time and explore the three Bitcoin halvings which occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020 to gain knowledge on how these events influenced miners\u2019 rewards for mining a block, the cryptocurrency industry, as well as shaped the market price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe first reduction of the block reward from 50 BTC to 25 took place way back in November 2012 followed by an increase of its value from almost $12 up to more than $1000.\n\nFirst Halving (2012)\n\nThe first halving of Bitcoin took place on November 28, 2012 and slashed the block reward from 50 BTC to 25. When it started, Bitcoin prices stood at around $12, but they spiked up to $42 within a span of 100 days post this event. Within one year of its inception, there was an enormous rise in price as high as $964, reflecting that halvings have huge influence over Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nSecond Halving (2016)\n\nThe second halving of Bitcoin, which took place in 2016, illustrated yet again the power that these events can have on pricing. A price rise was witnessed ahead of the event before a short-term downturn followed by an exponential surge to its peak of approximately $25,000 in December 2017. This increase could be attributed to the increased acceptance of cryptocurrencies and the emergence of initial coin offerings (ICOs) during this time as well.\n\nThird Halving (2020)\n\nWhen the third halving occurred on May 11, 2020, it decreased the block reward to 6.25 BTC and impacted both miners and users of Bitcoin in multiple ways. Transaction fees gained importance as an incentive for miners due to a lesser supply of new Bitcoins being produced. Despite this event not resulting in an immediate price increase \u2013 likely because external factors such as coronavirus \u2013 Bitcoin continued to spike to an all time high in late 2021 peaking at over $80,000.\n\nAnticipating the Next Bitcoin Halving\n\nAs we approach the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event in 2024, investors and enthusiasts are eager to analyse its potential impact on market rewards and mining. It is essential for us to take into account a range of factors that could shape the results such as demand for cryptocurrency, regulatory reforms, and overall conditions of this digital asset space. Demand has been an especially crucial factor when it comes to forecasting what may arise from the upcoming Bitcoin halving. As much remains uncertain with respect to the implications of reducing the Bitcoin issuance rate, understanding how all these influences affect Bitcoin will no doubt have major impacts moving forward.\n\nBlock Reward Reduction\n\nAs the Bitcoin halving approaches, it is projected to decrease the reward miners receive per block from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Miner\u2019s may need to adjust their strategies and business operations accordingly so that they can remain profitable. Market conditions, laws/regulations also form a crucial part affecting how much influence it has on Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory, and should be considered in addition to the havening.\n\nBitcoin Halving Myths and Misconceptions\n\nAs the Bitcoin halvings become more well-known each year, so too do misconceptions surrounding them. To help clarify matters, we\u2019ll dispel some of these popular misunderstandings by shedding light on what actually happens during halvings.\n\nGuaranteed Price Increases\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin halving, there is a common misunderstanding that prices will always rise. Historical data does indicate this has happened in the past, yet no one can be certain of what future events may bring due to market demand and external factors like regulation or global economic conditions. It is important for those interested in investing not to look at historical increases as an assurance, but instead, weigh up all available data so they can make informed decisions.\n\nThe End of Bitcoin Mining\n\nThe Bitcoin halving process has sparked a myth that it will eventually lead to the end of Bitcoin mining, because people think miners will not be incentivised once all 21 million Bitcoins are mined. This is an inaccurate assumption as miners receive transaction fees and these aren\u2019t going away anytime soon.\n\nAs block rewards diminish over time on the Bitcoin network, transaction fees become increasingly important in providing incentives for miners who work hard to secure the ecosystem by processing transactions.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event is a crucial factor that influences the crypto and mining environment by controlling how many new Bitcoins are generated while managing inflationary pressure. Having knowledge on this process and how it affects both miners and the network as a whole can assist investors to make more informed decisions. As we move closer to the next halving event in 2024, it\u2019s essential to stay informed to maximise the chance of success in the crypto market.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen is the next Bitcoin halving?\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving is projected to take place on April 26, 2024 at 07:07:17 PM UTC. The block reward will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin per block. The halving reduces the rate of creating new Bitcoins.\n\nIs Bitcoin halving in 2023?\n\nIt is forecasted that the upcoming halving of Bitcoin will occur in April or May 2024 with a new block reward rate set at 3.125 BTC instead of 6.25 BTC per block.\n\nHow do miners adapt to reduced block rewards?\n\nMining operations need to become more efficient, and miners may need to switch to more profitable alternatives in order to make up for reduced block rewards. Miners must take steps to reduce overhead costs, enhance their mining processes, and explore alternative sources of rewards such as transaction fees to remain profitable with reduced block rewards."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF: What Is It? Here\u2019s How It Lead To Recent Crypto Rally - ABP Live",
        "content": "The concept of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has been prevalent in the stock markets for quite some time. However, with the surging popularity of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, investors and financial institutions worldwide have become increasingly intrigued. As the interest in Bitcoin continues to grow, new and innovative financial products have emerged, aiming to connect the traditional finance industry with the realm of digital currencies. Among these pioneering products, the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund, or Bitcoin ETF, has garnered significant attention and interest.\n\nWhat Is A Bitcoin ETF?\n\nBitcoin ETF is a financial product that aims to track the price movements of Bitcoin. It operates similarly to traditional exchange-traded funds, which are investment funds that are traded on stock exchanges.\n\nBitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s price without actually owning the digital currency itself. Instead of buying and holding Bitcoin directly, investors can purchase shares or units of the ETF through their brokerage accounts. The ETF then holds the Bitcoin on behalf of its investors.\n\nThe value of a Bitcoin ETF is derived from the underlying price of Bitcoin. As the price of Bitcoin fluctuates, the value of the ETF\u2019s shares or units also changes accordingly. This enables investors to speculate on Bitcoin\u2019s price movements and potentially profit from them.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin ETF Work?\n\nLet's say there is a Bitcoin ETF called \"CryptoTracker ETF\" listed on a stock exchange. The ETF issuer purchases a specific amount of Bitcoin and holds it as an underlying asset. The ETF then issues shares or units that represent ownership in the fund.\n\nInvestors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin can buy shares of the CryptoTracker ETF through their brokerage accounts, just like purchasing shares of a stock. Each share represents a fraction of the total Bitcoin holdings of the ETF.\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin fluctuates in the market, the value of the CryptoTracker ETF's shares also changes. For example, if the price of Bitcoin increases by 5 per cent, the value of the ETF shares should also rise by a similar percentage.\n\nWhen an investor wants to sell their shares of the ETF, they can do so through their brokerage account, similar to selling stocks. The ETF will then provide the investor with the equivalent value based on the current Bitcoin price.\n\nHow Has Interest In Bitcoin ETFs Resulted In Recent Price Surge?\n\nOver the past few weeks, the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, has experienced a downturn following legal actions taken by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase for alleged violations of securities law. However, there has been a glimmer of hope as the market recently started to show signs of recovery following significant developments in the industry.\n\nThe market sentiment received a boost when BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This move instilled optimism within the crypto community, as it signalled a growing interest from mainstream financial institutions in incorporating cryptocurrencies into their offerings.\n\nAdding to the positive momentum, rumours emerged this week suggesting that Fidelity Investments, a prominent financial services provider, is also considering filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF. Furthermore, it was revealed that Deutsche Bank, a renowned global bank, has taken steps to venture into crypto custody by filing a licence application in Germany. These announcements generated a surge of positive investor sentiment, as financial institutions exploring crypto services indicated a growing acceptance of digital assets.\n\nAs a result, the market witnessed an upswing in activity and an increase in crypto prices. The developments involving major players in the financial industry embracing cryptocurrencies have contributed to the overall scaling up of the market, sparking renewed optimism among investors.\n\nWhat Should Investors Do?\n\nIn times of market fluctuations, implementing Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) can be a prudent strategy to capitalise on volatility.\n\nInvestors are advised to carefully assess their investment objectives, conduct comprehensive research, and diversify their portfolios to minimise risk. Establishing achievable profit targets and implementing effective risk management measures are also key considerations. It is essential to emphasise the significance of conducting thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n(The author is the CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global crypto investing platform)\n\nSubscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram:https://t.me/officialabplive\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions, beliefs, and views expressed by the various authors and forum participants on this website are personal and do not reflect the opinions, beliefs, and views of ABP Network Pvt.

        "title": "Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Outperforms Bitcoin Price Rise, Bringing 40% of Tokens into Profit - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nRecovery in SHIB prices causes 18.58 trillion tokens to become profitable\n\nFollowing the adjustment in SHIB\u2019s price, 28 billion moved to the top exchanges\n\nThe Shiba Inu team debuted a fascinating IRL feature SHIBACALS\n\nIn a turn of events, the price rise of the Shiba Inu token, SHIB caused an astounding amount of tokens to reach their break-even point finally. According to recent market data analysis , on June 19, over a trillion Shiba Inu directly recovered their original value as a result of the most recent price rise.\n\nOutperforming Biggest Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency increased by about 12% during the last few days, according to data from the cryptocurrency market , while Bitcoin, the industry leader, increased by 2.7% during the same time period, and Ethereum lost 0.6% of its value.\n\nData suggests a critical turning point for investors holding SHIB as the coin\u2019s price keeps rising. The extent and significance of the recent rise are shown by the fact that over a trillion SHIB tokens have switched from losses to profits.\n\nThe surge has increased by an incredible 12.4% in just the last week, bringing 18.58 trillion SHIB tokens into profit.\n\nShibarium For Improving SHIB Ecosystem\n\nThe cryptocurrency community has become very intrigued by the implications of this rise and the huge quantity of coins that have passed their break-even point. The reasons for SHIB\u2019s recent success are of great interest to observers, who are also interested in whether this rising trend can continue.\n\nThe digital token\u2019s resilience in the face of recent regulatory obstacles speaks volumes about the potential and growing trust in this meme coin. Despite the market\u2019s volatility, cryptocurrencies have developed a devoted following of supporters who are optimistic about their long-term prospects and fight to support them through token burns and their own layer-2 network, Shibarium.\n\nThe layer-2 Shibarium native test network of the Shiba Inu, known as Puppynet, has amassed a remarkable total of more than 20 million transactions, coming from an estimated 16 million wallets. This significant accomplishment reflects the network\u2019s consistent progress toward a wider rollout planned for the upcoming months.\n\nShibarium is a turning point for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, whose token is currently supported by the Ethereum network, which has limitations in terms of scalability and transaction throughput despite being a highly secure and decentralized blockchain.\n\nAccording to recent research by Santiment , numerous important cryptocurrencies, including $XRP, $ADA from Cardano, and the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, which was inspired by a meme, may be undervalued, which would indicate a chance for a rebound during the summer.\n\nSHIBACALS \u2013 IRL Version of SHIB Ecosystem\n\nThe Shiba Inu team recently revealed SHIBACALS \u2014an element of the Shiba Inu ecosystem that exists in real life. The feature aims to take SHIB outside of the digital space. Following Shytoshi Kusama, the principal developer, Lucie, the official content marketing professional for the Shiba ecosystem, highlighted the new feature.\n\nHey #ShibaArmy , let's talk about the electrifying prospect of connecting the In-Real-Life (IRL) component of the Shiba Inu Ecosystem! @shibacals ( follow them! ) \ud83c\udf10\ud83d\ude80 Shiba Inu is not just a digital phenomenon, but a community that thrives on real-world interactions.

Overall, five trades totaling 27.6 billion Shiba Inu were shoveled. The biggest SHIB lump that was transferred here was 10 billion SHIB. According to Etherscan, anonymous wallets transferred almost 17 billion Shiba Inus to addresses connected to Binance and Coinbase, the two biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nTo a Coinbase 10 wallet, a total of 6,039,968,812 SHIB were sent. An unidentified whale transferred 9,988,799,999 SHIB to the Binance 14 wallet.\n\nThese two Shiba Inu pieces appear to have been transported by their owners for sale. However, according to the aforementioned data source, more SHIB was purchased.\n\nThrough Jump Trading, 1,140,690,612 SHIB were purchased on Binance. The Binance 14 wallet sent 6,039,968,812 SHIB in total to an unidentified address. Shiba Inu meme coins worth 4,569,4490,905 were transferred from one unidentified address to another.\n\nShiba Inu were the subject of two big transfers last week, each of which involved the transfer of 3,811,233,843,288 SHIB from an anonymous address to a brand-new wallet.\n\nSHIB Price and Burn Rate Rise\n\nOver the past 24 hours, according to data shared by Shirburn recently, the burn rate of SHIB rose by over 1,000% with a total of 15,487,160 SHIB canine coins destroyed.\n\nGradually, the SHIB community keeps burning these meme tokens, pushing them to dead wallets and out of circulation. The ultimate goal is to reduce the circulating supply substantially in order to achieve a level of scarcity for Shiba Inu, which would enable a massive price risee.\n\nBy now, according to the Shibburn site, the community has managed to remove 410,649,295,177,809 SHIB from the market and lock them in unspendable wallets.\n\nThe overall amount of SHIB circulating out there now stands at 578,992,139,474,471 SHIB. Aside from that, 10,358,565,347,719 SHIB are currently locked in staking protocols."

        "title": "WBTC: Where Bitcoin Meets DeFi - Cryptonews - Cryptonews",
        "content": "WBTC: Where Bitcoin Meets DeFi\n\nAlexi Lane of Ethereum tokens explorer Ethplorer.\n\nSource: Adobe/Angelov\n\n____\n\nAs bitcoin (BTC) keeps reaching its new all-time highs, all eyes are on the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency as it dominated news cycles and attracted newcomers to the digital asset industry. The price action of the heavily followed asset is driving attention and investment into Ethereum (ETH)-based protocols such as Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) with the total value locked (TVL) in decentalized finance (DeFi) rising by over USD 20bn since January 2021.\n\nAt the turn of 2018-2019, the height of the most recent bear market, few knew about decentralized finance as an industry, yet just a year on, neologisms such as yield farming and liquidity mining have seen an influx in attention and investment with popular yield farming platform Harvest Finance having over USD 600m in TVL.\n\nWrapped Bitcoin, or WBTC for short, is the first ERC-20 token with the same 1:1 ratio to bitcoin, and it was launched in 2019.\n\nThe concept of WBTC emerged in a bid to improve bitcoin\u2019s functionality and usability by delivering the power of bitcoin with the flexibility of an ERC-20 token, allowing those with bitcoin to take part in major DeFi protocols, many of which are based on Ethereum.\n\nAs Bitcoin and the Ethereum blockchains are not compatible, WBTC bridges the gap.\n\nWBTC is completely transparent, 100% verifiable, and community-led, and with more people entering the space it is becoming even more crucial for these measures to be present in cryptocurrencies.\n\nWBTC is the pioneer of tokenized bitcoins with a market capitalization of USD 7.9bn, ranking 14th on CoinGecko (as of March 18, 12:45 UTC).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s limitations have been addressed through WBTC, while approaches to issuing and securing wrapped assets differ significantly from traditional bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s explore how WBTC helps provide more sophisticated financial services to traditional BTC holders and merges the worlds of Bitcoin and DeFi.\n\nCurrent state of affairs: The ways in which Bitcoin and DeFi have met in the middle\n\nThere is much debate in the industry as to whether or not Bitcoin, at the most basic level, is actually the original decentralized financial system.\n\nThis is because, people who use Bitcoin are already acting as their own banks (as long as they control their own private keys) and can permissionlessly exchange value with whomever they want, anywhere and under no central entity.\n\nWhat arguably stops Bitcoin from reaching parity with decentralized networks is its current use cases. These are mainly as a means of payment, HODLing, storage as digital gold, and trading on centralized exchanges.\n\nThis is where wrapping comes in. Wrapping tokens on Ethereum describes the process for transforming an existing crypto asset into an ERC-20 token. ERC-20 tokens remain the most widely-used standard for token design, and ensures that the rules of smart contracts remain compatible with applications like decentralized exchanges or lending protocols.\n\nThere are countless things you can do with WTBC that you can\u2019t with bitcoin.\n\nThese include adding more liquidity to your portfolio of crypto assets, using it as collateral for borrowing or lending, and yield farming.\n\nYou can interact with key DeFi projects via lending your WBTC on the decentralized lending system, Aave, and liquidity provisioning your WBTC on decentralized crypto exchanges like Uniswap.\n\nAccording to Ethplorer, a total of 129,336 tokenized bitcoins are circulating on the market. This is equivalent to approximately 4.11% of ethereum\u2019s market cap and 0.91% of the total market value of the first cryptocurrency.\n\nSource: ethplorer.io\n\nHow could the relationship between Bitcoin and DeFi evolve in 2021?\n\nAgainst the background of the boom in the DeFi sector, other wrapped projects have appeared \u2013 tBTC, renBTC, and HBTC \u2013 signalling how competition in the segment has intensified. This ranking by Ethplorer outlines the current status of leading wrapped tokens.\n\nSource: ethplorer.io\n\nProjects like WBTC and renBTC have long been entrenched in the listings of the largest exchanges and have become familiar to many users old and new.\n\nTo make the most of wrapped tokens and access the DeFi industry via bitcoin\u2019s liquidity, it\u2019s important to grasp the behaviors of wrapped tokens on the Ethereum blockchain using resources such as blockchain explorer platforms, Ethplorer and Etherscan, to breakdown things such as price action, transfers, and volume.\n\nIn 2021, if WBTC is to achieve true decentralization, it needs to combat a key drawback \u2013 centralized custodianship.\n\nWhat does this mean for the average crypto user?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s shortcomings on its own were one of the main reasons for the emergence and growth of the popularity of WBTC.\n\nUse-cases of wrapped tokens that appeal to crypto users range from the ability to access inexpensive loans where there is no Know Your Customer (KYC) and other bureaucratic red tapes, the possibility of placing funds at an attractive interest rate, spot and margin trading of tokens and derivatives on non-custodial exchanges, and asset insurance.\n\nThis opens up a much broader world of possibilities for crypto users who want to really engage with the variety of financial instruments available through DeFi.\n\nThis in turn signals the merging of both these worlds if Bitcoin maximalists begin to view decentralized financial markets as a good playing ground.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe combination of the power of Ethereum and the benefits of Bitcoin creates a powerful value proposition.\n\nFunnily for many skeptics, a year and a half after its creation, the capitalization of the first WBTC grew from almost zero to over USD 7bn, and since 2020, the market supply of WBTC has grown more than 200 times.\n\nAmid the ongoing boom in the DeFi sector, we can expect further growth in the capitalization of tokenized bitcoins, for which there are many use cases.\n\nThe apparent success of WBTC and other similar assets may also drive the rise in popularity of tokenized versions of altcoins to achieve the same success in intersecting different worlds in the blockchain industry.\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 DeFi On Bitcoin To Grow In The Shadow Of Ethereum\n\n\u2013 Prompted by Booming DeFi, a Bridge Between Bitoin and Ethereum is Growing\n\n\u2013 Red Lever Pulled on Bitcoin-Ethereum Bridge Two Days Post-Launch\n\n\u2013 What Can Crypto Crisis Managers Learn From BlockFi\u2019s Silence & tBTC\u2019s Openness?\n\n\u2013 Unchained DeFi Unicorns \u2013 The Next Wave of Billion Dollar Companies"

        "content": "In 2009, miners earned 50 bitcoins per block but $0 since Bitcoin was not priced at launch. In 2023, miners earn 6.25 BTC per block, which is around $162,500 (as of writing). Miners earn far less satoshis today, but much more fiat currency. Even when demand and fees reached all-time highs on the BTC network in May 2023, where fees earned in a block exceeded the subsidy for the first time since 2017, miners still earned less or the same BTC per block that they did in 2017 (12.5).\n\nNotably, if miners kept their BTC tokens from then, they saw the greatest price appreciation in an asset in human history. Of course, looking back, everyone wished they would have mined in 2009, or 2013 at 25 bitcoin per block, or 2017 at 12.5 bitcoin per block. At each halving event (roughly every 4 years), the BTC USD price has been much higher than the previous.\n\nIn between these points, when prices are falling and volatile, this mentality is not so clear. Miners come and go, as do the participants in the system. What is clear is that the incentives are to earn as much BTC as possible today, as generally speaking, there will be less available coins to earn tomorrow, as with each halving, the coins distributed are less and less.\n\nGiven the price increases, the incentives are to HODL, not spend coins in hopes of more price appreciation. The incentives from this interesting economic reality are staggering.\n\nFor example, this implies that entrepreneurs should create as often as possible, as early as possible, to earn as many coins as possible instead of working heads down for weeks or months for a product. This is completely contrary to traditional business practice, as it takes time to develop a well-functioning product. However, in a system where coins flow freely, without capital control, and information travels so quickly, the traditional approach is now obsolete. Two of the largest selling points of Bitcoin have been \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d and \u201cbe your own bank.\u201d\n\nWhile these naive concepts have some negative, unintended consequences, the most important and positive implications are ownership and creation.\n\nAnyone can create anything and own that thing on-chain. The word \u201cown\u201d implies they can do whatever they want with that thing. The \u201cBit\u201d in BitCoin represents data, and \u201cCoin\u201d means the token, but also the ability to invent or create.\n\nWhile a developer is working on a product in month 3 of 6, another can create something else out of nowhere that renders the previous\u2019 work obsolete in a span of 24 hours\u2014this is the nature of the system, as over 14 years, Bitcoin has absorbed more and more of the traditional financial system over time and while absorbing more fiat money akin to a black hole.\n\nWe have witnessed the most rapid example of this with Ordinals on BTC. In less than 150 days, we have seen token protocols, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), businesses, and exchanges built on BTC where none existed before January 2023. If someone was working on a fungible token protocol on BTC before March 7, that work was deprecated via a tweet on March 8. If someone was working on a centralized exchange for NFTs on BTC in February, that work was deprecated when Ordswap launched trustless trading via PSBTs days later.\n\nThe nature of the system is to create something that people want today, not tomorrow, and to create for those that own Bitcoin today, not tomorrow, for the coin will have more value on-chain and more creations tomorrow than today.\n\nWatch: Direct communication\u2014this is what peer-to-peer is meant to be, Craig Wright says\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "BBC Features Stories of Traders who Struck it Rich on Bitcoin\n\nThe mainstream media is continuing to focus on bitcoin (BTC) in the wake of the token\u2019s Tesla-fuelled record-breaking rise. And in the UK, the national broadcaster, the BBC, has delved into the world of British and international crypto investors, unearthing tales of folks hit the jackpot with BTC \u2013 and one who lost it all.\n\nSource: Adobe/Knut\n\nAmong those who came out on top were Javed Khan, an independent trader who said he got into BTC in earnest by chance in 2018.\n\nHe claimed that he used bitcoin as a means of transferring money as it was more \u201cconvenient\u201d than using bank transfers. But when Khan discovered that prices would often rise when he left his tokens alone for a while, he decided to take the plunge, and top up his BTC wallet with \u201cmoney that I could afford to lose.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that he had \u201ccashed in\u201d his BTC profits in January 2020 \u2013 using the proceeds to buy a luxury Bentley car.\n\nHe offered words of wisdom to potential BTC investors saying that when prices drop, he \u201cdoesn\u2019t lose faith\u201d:\n\n\u201cI think the best time to buy bitcoin is when nobody\u2019s talking about it \u2013 wait for the hype to die down.\u201d\n\nHeather Delaney, meanwhile, stated that she invested a mere GBP 5 (around USD 7) \u201cat the very beginning\u201d as \u201cpart of her pension plan,\u201d building her investment up over time: a strategy that has seen her accrue a\u201d 585.41% increase in [her] investment.\u201d\n\nShe also admitted dabbling in the altcoin market, stating,\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never cashed it out \u2013 but I have converted some to other currencies as the market has fluctuated.\u201d\n\n(As reported, major crypto exchange Coinbase claims that although most of its users initially favor BTC, the vast majority also go on to trade altcoins.)\n\nA second early adopter was Daniel Crocker, who first bought into BTC in 2012 during an apprenticeship at a tech firm. After some early activity, he \u201ckept hold\u201d of his tokens until summer 2020, when he \u201ctraded them in\u201d to partially pay for the deposit on his house.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I want to pin my future on, he mused.\u201d\n\nAnother BTC enthusiast, James Saye, claimed that he made his first investment, worth around USD 700 in 2017. He rode the wave successfully before \u201ccashing it in\u201d for around USD 3,500 during \u201cone of its peaks,\u201d using the fiat to pay for \u201ca great holiday in Iceland.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cash came in handy,\u201d said Saye, \u201cIceland is lovely but expensive.\u201d\n\nBut Saye appears to have caught the BTC bug. He admitted to \u201cbuying in again\u201d in 2018 when prices were lower, meaning he is \u201cstill in.\u201d\n\nThese were not all stories of cheer, though.\n\nDavid Stubley, the founder of the 7 Elements cybersecurity outfit, told the cautionary tale of a client who was using BTC to save up to buy a house, before fraudsters targetted him with a phishing email, successfully making off with BTC 83 (USD 3.7m today) in a 2017 raid.\n\nStubley explained,\n\n\u201cWe tracked the payment on the blockchain. We could see it rolling across various wallets and finally, it reached a wallet containing USD 15 million of currency.\u201d\n\nThis was not to be a happily-ever-after ending for the baddies. While the client will likely never see their BTC again, neither, it seems, will the robbers.\n\nThe 7 Elements boss claimed that his firm was \u201cable to have the wallets frozen, so at least denying [the fraudsters] access to the stolen funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce it\u2019s gone,\u201d he warned, darkly, \u201cit really has gone.\u201d\n\nAnd an Australia-based engineer named Rohan Muscat tried his hand at mining in 2016, with less than favorable results.\n\nAfter some promising early success, he moved to \u201cbigger scale mining.\u201d That \u201cpaid for itself\u201d at first, but then \u201cwent downhill,\u201d with skyrocketing electricity bills of up to USD 464 per month.\n\nRealizing he had bitten off more than he could chew, Muscat eventually bailed, selling his equipment \u2013 although he says he is still \u201csitting on\u201d around USD 1,550 worth of crypto.\n\n___\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 17 People in Crypto \u2013 Do You Recognize Yourself?\n\n\u2013 SoftBank Boss Glad to Be out of Bitcoin, But His Firm Is Still in the Game\n\n\u2013 \u2018Rich Dad\u2019 Robert Kiyosaki To Reinvest Stimulus Money in Bitcoin, Gold, Silver\n\n\u2013 Has Ashton Kutcher Left XRP?

        "content": "This Man Says He Invested Half His Lottery Winnings in Bitcoin\n\nThe news of an American man who put half of his lottery winnings into Bitcoin (BTC) has spread through the Cryptoverse.\n\nSource: Reddit, u/Joxnlol\n\nThe Reddit user \u2018Joxnlol\u2019 posted an image of himself several hours ago holding a certificate from the Illinois Lottery, stating that he has won USD 500,000 back in April this year. Additional verification photos the user posted show his winning lottery ticket, purchased at the end of February 2019. However, in a comment from half a year ago, the user said that after taxes, he was left with USD 355,000.\n\nIn either case, what is interesting for the Cryptoverse\u2019s point of view is that Joxnlol allegedly invested half of this amount, or USD 177,500, into BTC. \u201cDid this. Then put half into BTC in May,\u201d said the lottery winner/BTC supporter, adding \u201cRemind me in 8 months if I fucked up.\u201d\n\nIn the same Reddit comment from six months ago, Joxnlol described his three-year plan: \u201cI had about USD 4,000 in debt. I took care of that. I\u2019m allowing myself USD 30,000 to spend at the most. My major plans are to buy a used Dairy Queen that is already operational for USD 200,000 under financing. Run it for a year by two more, create a salary of USD 170,000 at least and then pays I\u2019m going to run all three and buy a couple houses.\u201d\n\nMany people in the comments seem to be happy for the user winning the money, as well as investing it in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency that appreciated by 46% in the past 12 months. Others have been debating taxes on lottery winnings, as well as the user\u2019s decision to go public with the winnings and whether or not this is actually required in Illinois.\n\nJoxnlol\u2019s reply to one security-related comment was that he already lives in a neighborhood where people have more than USD 500,000, where he wouldn\u2019t be the only target for a potential attacker, adding \u201cIf bitcoin goes to USD 20,000,000 plenty other people will have problems than just me, lol. Even if BTC hit USD 1,000,000 I\u2019d obviously take my security more seriously and be living in a treehouse disguised as a homeless person.\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s see what the charts say happened to his money if he converted it to BTC in early May. At the time, BTC\u2019s price was already on a gradual rise from its lowest point in the past 12 months (USD 3,188). In June and July, the price had probably put Joxnlol and other traders through quite an emotional roller-coaster with a couple of rallies, a tempo which pretty much continued in the months that followed. On May 1st, the price of BTC was c. USD 5,390 and at the moment of writing (11:18 UTC ) it\u2019s USD 9,321, which means that Joxnlol\u2019s investment saw a rise of up to 73%.\n\nBitcoin price chart (May-November):\n\nHaving been moved to Twitter, the discussion also touched on the BTC-lottery connection."

        "title": "Bengaluru police chief writes to CID for further probe into Bitcoin scam involving hacker Sriki - The Indian Express",
        "content": "The Bengaluru city police have written to the state CID to conduct further investigations into the infamous Bitcoin scam that surfaced in Karnataka in 2020 during the regime of the previous BJP government. The case involved allegations of police-politician nexus in diverting the wealth found with hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, 29.\n\nSince the Congress came to power in Karnataka last month after deposing the BJP, state Home Minister G Parameshwara has stated that the Bitcoin scam would be re-examined. Police sources said Bengaluru Police Commissioner B Dayanand has now written to the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to carry out investigations into the scam.\n\nA former ED official who investigated the suspected money laundering involved in the hacking cases against Sriki was recently posted to Bengaluru city by the state government. The hacker was reportedly linked to the sons of several top politicians in Karnataka.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in 2020, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the Bengaluru police had stumbled on the suspected possession of a large quantity of Bitcoin following Sriki\u2019s arrest in a case of procuring drugs over the dark web using cryptocurrency. The hacker reportedly claimed to have acquired a large amount of Bitcoin by hacking exchanges.\n\nInvestigations in the drug case led to the CCB filing a second case against the hacker and his high-profile associates for allegedly hacking online poker sites and crypto exchanges to acquire wealth through illegal means. The CCB investigations were however hit by allegations of corruption and diversion of wealth in the possession of the hacker gang.\n\nThe CCB probe initially claimed to have recovered 31 bitcoins worth Rs 9 crore from the hacker, but the police later claimed to have been duped by the hacker into believing that the cryptocurrency at an exchange was transferred to an online seizure wallet created by the police to hold the recovered bitcoins.\n\nThe CID at the same time was investigating a July 2019 hacking of the state e-procurement cell in which Rs 11.5 crore was stolen. The CCB probe in 2020 revealed that the hacking gang led by Sriki was behind the e-procurement cell hack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CID and CCB were at virtual loggerheads during the investigations of the crimes following Sriki\u2019s arrest in November 2020, with the agencies fighting a turf battle for his custody and for materials seized from the suspect.\n\nThe CID\u2019s cyber crime division sent seven letters to the CCB unit that arrested the hacker in November 2020 seeking data from computer devices belonging to him and approached a court on two occasions for the data before it was eventually handed over, a CID chargesheet in the e-procurement cell hacking case revealed in December 2021.\n\nThe CID and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED), which also looked at the e-procurement cell hacking case, were able to recover only a small portion of the Rs 11.5 crore stolen funds.\n\nThe CID filed a charge sheet on December 15, 2021 against Sriki and 17 others for the 2019 heist at the state e-governance cell. It involved charges of theft, receiving of stolen property, disposal of stolen property, causing disappearance of evidence, destruction of evidence, and criminal acts against the hacker Srikrishna Ramesh, his associates Sunish Hegde, a civil contractor, Hemanth Mudappa, a racer, and 15 others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of the corruption allegations have come up due to an ego clash between some officers in the CCB and the CID over the handling of the cases,\u201d sources in the Karnataka police department said in 2021.\n\nIn an additional statement in a case where he is accused of hacking a poker gaming site, Sriki claimed that he voluntarily agreed to give away Bitcoins in his possession to the police. \u201cI understood the case scenario that even if I do not give them the Bitcoins they can use forensic methods to find the Bitcoins. Post consultations I voluntarily accepted (sic) to give away Bitcoins which I had kept in various wallets in different cryptocurrencies,\u201d read the statement.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was trading at over $50,000 per Bitcoin when Sriki was arrested in 2020.\n\nThe ED, which is investigating Sriki\u2019s transactions for possible money laundering, has been looking at the receipt of an unexplained amount of 50,000 British pounds by his brother Sudarshan Ramesh as possible crime proceeds. The amount was subsequently transferred to a person identified as Hanish Patel, a UK resident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CID probe in the e-procurement cell hacking case had revealed that the gang involved in the hacking of the e-procurement portal of the centre for e-governance of the Karnataka government in July 2019 \u2013 resulting in the theft of Rs 11.5 crore \u2013 laundered the stolen money through an elaborate network created ahead of the crime.\n\nA separate money laundering probe carried out by the ED (parallel to the CID probe) resulted in the seizure of Rs 1.43 crore of stolen funds classified as proceeds of the hacking crime.\n\nThe ED, in a seizure report, stated that the gang involved in the hacking paid commissions to businessmen who received stolen funds in their accounts to facilitate cash transfers back to the hackers."

        "title": "Bitcoin breaks above $30,000 after BlackRocks ETF news | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News ... - Guardian Nigeria",
        "content": "This week we have witnessed many exhilarating twists and turns in the cryptocurrency landscape. From Bitcoin\u2019s soaring highs spurred by BlackRock\u2019s ambitious venture into the crypto ETF realm to the SEC\u2019s hard-hitting scrutiny of crypto behemoths like Binance and Coinbase. We\u2019ll also shed light on the profound principles at the core of the crypto revolution \u2013 the need for self-custody and financial privacy. So, whether you\u2019re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or a curious newcomer, this exploration promises to unravel the complexities of this dynamic, ever-evolving digital asset world, reminding us why we got into this fascinating game in the first place.\n\nThis week Bitcoin, the reigning monarch of the crypto realm, scored a more than one-year high. Now, isn\u2019t that something to write home about? This dazzling climb rounded off a week of sprightly gains, credited, in part, to the charming BlackRock\u2019s scheme to roll out a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2013 right under the discerning gaze of U.S. regulators who seem to be developing a rather keen interest in the digital asset sector.\n\nBlackRock, the unrivalled titan of asset management, put forth paperwork last week to bring iShares Bitcoin Trust into existence. A shiny new ETF, with none other than Coinbase Custody as its custodian, handpicked to provide institutional investors with a taste of the tantalising world of cryptocurrency.\n\nEarlier this week, EDX Markets, a crypto exchange backed by formidable investment firms Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel Securities, declared it would enable trading on certain cryptocurrencies. While some might dub this the \u201cgame-changer,\u201d I like to think of it as a much-needed shot in the arm for cryptocurrencies, which were a tad under the weather following a string of distressing meltdowns from crypto firms \u2013 including the sudden, spectacular collapse of the exchange FTX late last year.\n\nDarkening the clouds, the digital currency market has been under the cosh of escalating regulatory scrutiny. Take, for instance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent salvo \u2013 lawsuits against the crypto titans Coinbase Global and Binance. The SEC charges them with breaking its rules, allegations that Coinbase and Binance fervently dispute.\n\nThe SEC goes after Binance and Coinbase\n\nJust as we were starting to get comfy, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with its now-famous penchant for spoiling the party, took aim at the pulsating heart of the cryptocurrency universe. What\u2019s that in their crosshairs, you ask? Why, the crypto exchange Binance and its ever-resilient founder, Changpeng Zhao.\n\nAccusing them of running a \u201cweb of deception,\u201d the SEC charged Zhao and his exchange with a baker\u2019s dozen of offences. Picture this: a classic game of cat and mouse, where the regulators, armed with their magnifying glasses, sniff out the discrepancies in the crypto wonderland.\n\nOne of the SEC\u2019s most scathing allegations is that Binance and Zhao never truly separated the US company from its US exchange spin-off. Binance.US, playing the innocent, claimed to have put up a digital wall, barring its customers from trading on Binance.com since 2019. But wait, the SEC has a twist in the tale \u2013 they allege that Binance and Zhao cleverly outwitted their own controls, enabling high-value US customers to continue trading on the Binance.com platform in secret.\n\nIt gets juicier. While Binance.US was donning the mask of an independent trading platform for US investors, the SEC claims Zhao was the puppeteer controlling this operation from behind the scenes. Among the \u2018forbidden fruits\u2019 offered to its US customers were commodity derivatives \u2013 essentially gambling chips for betting on cryptocurrency prices.\n\nIt\u2019s evident that the SEC has developed a taste for this crypto crackdown. Their resolve was only strengthened by the collapse of FTX last year, leading to charges against its founder. Now, even Coinbase has been dragged into the fray, accused of operating as an \u201cunregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency.\u201d\n\nAs we marvel at these unfolding events, one can\u2019t help but ask: does Blackrock\u2019s foray into the crypto arena have anything to do with this? A mere coincidence or something more, you decide.\n\nCore Values of Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe core ethos of cryptocurrency, if you will, revolves around the concept of not requiring intermediaries. This notion shines a spotlight on two critical practices for crypto users: self-custody and financial privacy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with self-custody. The term might seem to carry a degree of gravitas, and rightly so. It essentially means taking charge of one\u2019s crypto assets. Think of it as being your own bank, sans the brick-and-mortar facade. You\u2019re not entrusting your hard-earned digital assets to a third party. Instead, you\u2019re securing them in your personal wallet, with private keys only you control. This practice arms users with unprecedented control over their assets, a virtue that\u2019s both empowering and necessitates a heightened sense of responsibility. Moreover, it strengthens the overall integrity of the blockchain ecosystem by minimizing single points of failure \u2013 no centralized entities to fall victim to hackers or insolvency.\n\nThe second practice, financial privacy, is where platforms like Tornadocash.vn come into play. In the world where digital footprints are as revealing as physical ones, maintaining financial privacy is paramount. Tornado Cash, a non-custodial privacy solution on Ethereum, helps users achieve just that.\n\nOperating on a sophisticated principle of cryptographic anonymity, Tornado Cash obfuscates the on-chain link between source and destination addresses. When a user deposits coins into the Tornado Pool, the platform issues a proof, a cryptographic testament of the transaction. Later, a new, unrelated address can make a withdrawal using this proof, effectively breaking the link between the sender and receiver addresses. This mechanism ensures that your transactions remain anonymous and untraceable, providing a crucial layer of privacy in the otherwise transparent ecosystem of public blockchains.\n\nWhy is this necessary, you ask? Well, consider this. Blockchain\u2019s transparency, while an asset, can sometimes become a liability. Every transaction is recorded and can potentially be traced back to you, jeopardizing your financial privacy. Using Tornado Cash or similar platforms gives you an extra layer of privacy, allowing you to use your digital assets without leaving a trail of breadcrumbs.\n\nAs we delve deeper into the enigmatic world of cryptocurrencies, remember this \u2013 it\u2019s not just about riding the wave of price volatility. It\u2019s about embracing the transformative principles underpinning the technology: self-sovereignty, financial freedom, and privacy. After all, isn\u2019t that what the crypto revolution is all about?\n\n"

        "title": "ChatGPT gives 10 reasons why you should buy Bitcoin - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the dominant cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, has witnessed remarkable growth throughout the years, serving multiple purposes, including its role as an investment vehicle. Currently, advocates are pushing for its widespread adoption due to numerous compelling factors, resulting in its heightened global attention.\n\nIn light of this, Finbold sought insights from generative artificial intelligence tool (AI), ChatGPT, with the prompt \u2018Give me 10 reasons to buy Bitcoin\u2019. Below are the argument fronted by the tool;\n\n#1 Return Potential\n\nThe tool pointed out that throughout its existence, Bitcoin has witnessed remarkable price appreciation, captivating the attention of numerous investors enticed by its potential to deliver substantial returns on their investments. It is worth noting that the asset reached an all-time high of almost $69,000 in late 2021. The asset is currently attempting to exit last year\u2019s bear market, trading above $30,000.\n\n#2 Decentralization\n\nChatGPT acknowledged that Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization nature makes it appealing since the nature sets it apart from conventional financial systems governed by central authorities such as governments or banks.\n\n\u201cThis decentralized nature can appeal to those seeking financial independence and a system free from traditional institutions,\u201d the tool said.\n\n#3 Hedge against traditional financial systems\n\nThe AI tool stated that Bitcoin is widely regarded as a potential hedge against the vulnerabilities of the traditional financial system. Many astute investors perceive it as a means to safeguard their wealth from potential economic downturns, inflationary pressures, or the erosion of currency value.\n\nTherefore, by embracing Bitcoin, ChatGPT stated that these investors aim to fortify their financial positions and shield themselves from the uncertainties and risks associated with traditional monetary systems.\n\n#4 Limited supply\n\nOne of the compelling arguments was that Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply, set at a maximum of 21 million coins, serves as a reason to invest in this digital asset. According to the insights provided by the tool, the scarcity of Bitcoin has the potential to drive its value upward over time, particularly as demand continues to grow while the supply remains fixed.\n\nThis inherent ability of Bitcoin is seen as a solution to one of the inherent pitfalls of traditional financial systems, where the excessive printing of money can lead to the devaluation of the currency.\n\n#5 Store of value\n\nThroughout its evolution, Bitcoin has garnered comparisons to gold, earning the moniker \u201cdigital gold.\u201d This association has prompted ChatGPT to highlight it as a compelling reason to invest in the asset.\n\nThe finite supply and decentralized nature of Bitcoin make it highly appealing to individuals seeking an alternative asset class that possesses the potential to preserve its value over the long haul. By resembling gold in these aspects, Bitcoin offers investors the prospect of diversifying their portfolios with a digital asset that exhibits resilience and store-of-value characteristics.\n\n#6 Global accessibility\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, one reason to invest in Bitcoin is its global accessibility without the limitations imposed by geographical boundaries. This distinctive attribute facilitates seamless fund transfers and has the potential to unlock investment opportunities that extend beyond traditional markets.\n\nBy transcending the confines of geographical restrictions, Bitcoin offers investors the flexibility to participate in the digital economy and explore investment avenues previously inaccessible or constrained by conventional financial systems.\n\n#7 Increasing adoption\n\nThe tool pointed out that investors can put money in Bitcoin based on its growing adoption. The tool highlighted that Bitcoin had received recognition from various individuals, businesses, and institutions worldwide. In this case, ChatGPT pointed out that the growing acceptance and integration into mainstream finance may lead to increased liquidity and stability in the market.\n\n#8 Potential for financial inclusion\n\nAccording to the tool\u2019s insights, Bitcoin can potentially extend financial services to unbanked or underbanked individuals. By leveraging Bitcoin, these individuals can actively participate in the global economy, gain access to essential financial tools, and facilitate fund transfers more inclusively and efficiently. The efficiency offered by Bitcoin in this regard emerges as a compelling reason to consider investing in this digital asset.\n\n#9 Technological innovation\n\nThe underlying blockchain technology goes beyond cryptocurrency and holds transformative potential across diverse industries such as finance, supply chain management, and healthcare. The insights from ChatGPT emphasize that investing in Bitcoin can be driven by a desire to gain exposure to the revolutionary capabilities of blockchain technology.\n\n#10 Diversification\n\nThroughout its existence, Bitcoin has emerged as an investment product that has found its place in diverse portfolios. ChatGPT suggests including Bitcoin in an investment portfolio can offer valuable diversification benefits. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have demonstrated a relatively low correlation with traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds.\n\nThis implies that they may exhibit different behaviors in various market conditions. By incorporating Bitcoin into a well-diversified portfolio, there is a potential to reduce overall risk and enhance risk-adjusted returns by tapping into the unique characteristics and potential growth opportunities the cryptocurrency market presents.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged to over $31,400 on Friday, reaching its highest level since 2022, fueled by growing institutional interest in the maiden cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin briefly retracted, it has managed to maintain a trading value above $30,000 for the first time since April. This price level has proven to be a significant resistance point throughout 2023.\n\nHaving risen by over 85% in value this year, the recent rally faces uncertainties regarding the sustainability of its gains. The overall market grapples with regulatory concerns and macroeconomic factors contributing to the prevailing uncertainty.\n\nIn this line, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe expressed doubts about the cryptocurrency\u2019s ability to sustain its rally in a tweet on June 24. However, he noted that if Bitcoin experiences a minor correction to around $28,500, it will present an ideal opportunity to accumulate the asset.\n\n\u201cBitcoin made a nice high, through which it swept the yearly high. I\u2019m unsure whether we\u2019ll continue running from here, but during uptrends you\u2019ll most likely see price continuing to run rather than have deep corrections. If we have a correction, $28,500 I buy,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInstitutional interest boost Bitcoin\u2019s value\n\nThe current surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value can largely be attributed to the increasing interest from major financial institutions. Notably, BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the world\u2019s largest investment management company, recently applied to register a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nFurthermore, this week witnessed the launch of a digital asset trading platform by EDX Markets, a cryptocurrency exchange supported by renowned firms such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Citadel Securities.\n\nThese initiatives have instilled investor confidence in the crypto space, especially at a time when the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified its regulatory crackdown on crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase over the alleged listing of unregistered securities.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIn terms of Bitcoin\u2019s price analysis, as of now, it is comfortably trading above the resistance level of $30,000, with a valuation of $30,621. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin has experienced a growth of over 15%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin one-day technical analysis obtained from TradingView indicates a bullish trend. The gauges summarize a \u201cbuy\u201d sentiment at 14 while moving averages suggest a \u201cstrong buy\u201d at 13. Oscillators remain neutral, with a sentiment score of 8.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite its substantial growth this year, Bitcoin still trails behind its previous record high of over $60,000, achieved in 2021.\n\nThe cryptocurrency faced significant challenges last year due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s swift interest rate adjustments and the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. These events triggered a widespread sell-off in the crypto market, consequently impacting Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
