That would require a couple of wheels to fall off, and wheels tend to fall off in the great bubbles' unraveling, but it doesn't mean they have to. The S&P would be unlikely not to get to something close to 3,000.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"The simple arithmetic suggests you'll either have a dismal return forever, or you'll have a nice bear market and then a normal return. And the nice bear market will be hopefully less than a 50% decline, but it won't be a huge amount less than 50% from the peak in real terms.\"\n\n4. \"You increase the pressure on a very complicated system until a few things snap. That is the pattern \u2014 something breaks and nobody seems to know what it is. It's always a surprise, but you always have a surprise, so the idea of a surprise is totally unsurprising.\"\n\n5. \"My guess is we will have a recession. I don't know whether it will be fairly mild or fairly serious, but it will probably go deep into next year.\"\n\n6. \"The most vulnerable area in my opinion is the Russell 2000. It often has no collective earnings at all. It has a very high density of zombies \u2014 companies that really can only pay their interest payments by issuing more debt. They're vulnerable on the debt front, vulnerable on the financial front, and vulnerable on a broad economic front.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \"An over 40-year period of driving down mortgage rates, of course you drove up house prices all over the world, pretty much. And now the rates have gone up, of course it will drive down.\"\n\n8. \"House prices are worse for the ordinary household. They're worse for the economy than stocks because they're substantially more broadly owned. It's really an important part of the median family's income picture and capital picture. The motto should be, 'Don't mess with housing.' The super motto should be, 'Never have a housing bubble at the same time as you have a stock-market bubble.'\"\n\n9. \"Although we didn't get carried away with ridiculous subprime this time, the multiple of family income actually went higher than it did in 2007. So in terms of actual long-term vulnerability posed by overpricing, this housing market was more overpriced, and it was accompanied by a much more overpriced and classically bubbly stock market than 2007.\"\n\n10. \"Don't invest in real estate, don't invest in the US. If you have to invest in the US, quality has been the mispriced asset for 100 years. They outperform in bear markets. They underperform in bull markets, because you want to own Tesla, you want to own meme stocks, you want to own what's flying. You don't want to own Coca-Cola, it's just too boring.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. \"When it comes to quality, they have less risk of every kind. They have less debt, they go bankrupt less, they have less volatility, they have a lower beta. Yet they outperform. That is a free lunch.\"\n\n12. \"Bitcoin is, of course, an elaborate scam, really.\"\n\n13. \"Commodities break your heart because just as they're doing well, they have a wipeout for 18 months, and then they go roaring back to a new high.\"\n\n14. \"Artificial intelligence is absolutely for real. Is it big enough, soon enough to stop the deflating? No, I don't think it is. It's a 10-, 20-year, multi-decadal effect going off into the distant future, and it will be potentially vast in its effects.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. \"I'm not a great believer in economists. They've lost the plot for the last 70 years. They've forgotten their job description, which is to be useful. They drown in assumptions and closed systems, which are largely irrelevant for everything except their reputation inside their industry.\"\n\n16. \"You should not be surprised if the price of oil doesn't go over $100 maybe once or twice in the next five years. You should be amazed if the price of oil does not then have a long-term crutch, and it will run down to a level where the Saudis or somebody will be able to grind out $45 oil into the setting sun. That's how I think the game will end.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin Price: El Salvador Crypto Advisor Predicts Explosive Rise To $220,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In a recent development, Bitcoin proponent and crypto advisor to El Salvador\u2019s President Max Keiser has made a future prediction for the Bitcoin price, joining the ranks of analysts who have made bold assertions about the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s trajectory.\n\nKeiser Says Bitcoin Price To $220,000\n\nIn a tweet shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Keiser stated that the Bitcoin price will experience an explosive rise to $220,000 in the short term. However, he didn\u2019t specify how soon the crypto token would see such a rally. He made this assertion in response to a CNBC article about the current decline in the financial market amid economic and inflation concerns.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Keiser once again reiterated that Bitcoin would rise to $220,000 as he claims that \u201cCentral banks will print a wall of money visible from outer space.\u201d His belief seems to stem from the fact that many will be looking to use Bitcoin as a hedge against rising inflation.\n\nHe even alluded to the fact that the US dollar was losing its purchasing power \u201cat a very rapid pace.\u201d He gave an instance of how paying $100 for hamburgers years ago looked like a joke, but he had just spent \u201c$84 for a very ordinary hamburger.\u201d\n\nFor the longest time, Keiser has been bullish on the foremost cryptocurrency. In 2011, he called Bitcoin the \u201ccurrency of the resistance\u201d and the \u201cbiggest story of the decade.\u201d Additionally, he always touted a financial collapse as what would spark a massive rally in the Bitcoin price. Then, he stated that Bitcoin\u2019s adoption and price will increase as banks collapse.\n\nArthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, also shares similar sentiments with Keiser. He recently stated that the government would likely resort to money printing to save the bond market, which could lead to a meteoric rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC bulls struggle to maintain control | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIs Inflation Good Or Bad For Crypto?\n\nThere seem to be divergent views on how rising inflation could affect Bitcoin and the crypto market by extension. While people like Keiser and Hayes see rising inflation as bullish for Bitcoin, others like Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten believe that inflation could spell more trouble for Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to Merten, the Federal Reserve needs to keep hiking interest rates to bring down the inflation rate as there is excess money in the system due to the \u201cexcess printing of money.\u201d Meanwhile, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone warned that the rising interest rates could cause a further decline in the Bitcoin price.\n\nThere also seems to be a correlation between the stock and crypto markets. As such, it doesn\u2019t seem like Bitcoin and the crypto market exist in isolation, as any financial crisis could significantly impact it.\n\nFeatured image from The Face, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter surging above the US$28,000 level, Bitcoin traded between US$27,500 and US$27,800 this week. Factors such as a surge in the US 10-year Treasury yield by 11 basis points to reach 4.8% on Tuesday, and traders capitalizing on recent profits, led to a period of consolidation.The immediate resistance levels for Bitcoin on the upside are located around US$27,650 and subsequently US$28,000. A decisive breakthrough above the US$28,000 resistance level could trigger another bullish run. However, if Bitcoin fails to maintain its upward momentum, the next support level is positioned around US$27,400, with further support possibly at US$27,200.It's noteworthy that Bitcoin has demonstrated a remarkable year-to-date performance, surging by 65%, although it remains down by 59% from its all-time high.In parallel with Bitcoin, Ethereum closely followed a similar trajectory in its price action. Ethereum initiated an attempt at recovery, originating from the US$1,630 zone. Key resistance levels for ETH are seen at US$1,650 and then US$1,720. Failing to breach these immediate resistance levels could lead to a retracement, with the next crucial support situated at US$1,600. Despite a 66% decline from its all-time high, Ethereum has shown resilience in 2023, registering a 34% increase year-to-date.In an interesting turn of events, Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have commenced trading in the US. Diverse investment firms, including ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly, and Volshares, collectively launched a total of 9 ETFs on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), marking a significant milestone in the crypto investment landscape.Furthermore, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) has taken a proactive stance by offering guidance to cryptocurrency exchanges and issuers regarding their interim approach to what they term \"value-referenced crypto assets.\" This guidance, with a specific focus on stablecoins , provides much-needed clarity and a regulatory framework for crypto-service providers operating in Canada.Lastly, following ongoing efforts to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund, Grayscale has now revealed its intentions to pursue a similar transformation for its Ethereum product, highlighting the growing interest and demand for crypto ETFs as traditional financial institutions embrace digital assets.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing cryptos over the past week:As per prices on Friday.1. Trust Wallet Token is up by 20%2. Solana is up by 15%3. Bitcoin SV is up by 14%4. Avalanche is up by 13%5. Render is up by 13%1. Frax Share is down by 12%2. ApeCoin is down by 11%3. Pepe is down by 10%4. Compound is down by 9%5. Curve DAO Token is down by 9%(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) scraped the bottom of the barrel in the third quarter of the year, registering a loss of 11.1% for investors, barely beating long-term treasuries, which netted -11.9% over the same timeframe.\n\nGreg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at Bitcoin firm NYDIG, wrote about the crypto\u2019s poor performance and how it defies recent events in the crypto space.\n\nCipolaro pointed to favorable court cases, macroeconomic changes, the recent \u201cquagmire\u201d over government funding, the debate on U.S. debt, and the \u201congoing efforts to secure approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF,\u201d highlighting how none of these developments managed to push Bitcoin past the upper bound of its current range\u2013which he said sits at $31,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin, however, wasn\u2019t the only asset to register losses last quarter. In fact, almost every asset class\u2014including gold and other precious metals, the U.S. stock market, and real estate\u2014suffered important percentage drops.\n\nNotably, only four assets celebrated wins in the quarter, with commodities gaining 15.5%, seconded by cash at 1.3%.\n\nEconomist for the Heritage Foundation, Peter St. Onge, said a momentary pause in rising prices might be behind Bitcoin\u2019s meager performance. \u201cI think the main driver near-term has been inflation looking more sedate,\u201d he told Decrypt, adding that gold also feels these effects.\n\nThis trend might not be long-lived, however. St. Onge pointed out that recent events in Israel might trigger price action in financial assets. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens in the Middle East,\u201d he said, explaining that \u201chard assets tend to shore up, but risk assets go down.\u201d\n\nFor him, \u201cBitcoin is a bit of both.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSt. Onge\u2019s views differ from those of NYDIG\u2019s global head of research.\n\nCipolaro sees \u201cpersistently\u201d high inflation, rising interest rates, \u201crecession worries,\u201d and seasonality weighed on returns, highlighting that Bitcoin tends to showcase dismal performances in the third quarter of every year. Perhaps in an effort to give investors hope, however, he wrote that the \u201clackluster performance\u201d has a silver lining: the fourth quarter is historically one of the asset\u2019s best quarters.\n\nIn spite of its most recent quarterly performance, Bitcoin investors will have to wait and see if the top cryptocurrency recovers its early 2023 trend, which has seen the asset on fire. Bitcoin has gained 63% on the year, only one of four to register double-digit gains, and is eclipsing its closest contender, U.S. Large Cap Growth Funds by more than double."

        "content": "Even as a Special Investigation Team of the Karnataka CID has stepped up the probe against Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, 29, and his associates for stealing government funds and allegedly paying state officials in cryptocurrency to cover up their crimes, a local court has kept in abeyance an SIT plea to cancel the hacker\u2019s bail.\n\nA local court in Bengaluru this week directed that a requisition made by the investigating officer of the SIT in the alleged Bitcoin scam case, seeking to cancel Srikrishna Ramesh\u2019s bail and to direct him to co-operate in the probe, be \u201ckept in abeyance\u201d until a medical evaluation for his drug addiction problem is completed.\n\nThe court said that it would consider the SIT plea for cancellation of the hacker\u2019s bail in a case of hacking multiple poker sites and cryptocurrency exchanges from 2021 \u2013 which the SIT is re-investigating on the orders of the new Congress government in the state \u2013 after the Centre for Addiction Medicine at NIMHANS Hospital medically evaluates him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SIT\u2019s move to seek cancellation of the bail comes amid a series of searches and arrests that are being conducted by the probe team. On Saturday, the probe team conducted searches at the residences of four police inspectors and a private information technology expert who were involved in the original investigation against Srikrishna and his associates in 2020 and 2021, sources said.\n\nIn an official statement, the SIT said, \u201cSpecial Investigation Team formed by government of Karnataka is investigating cases connected to laundering of bitcoins and other cases. In connection with the investigation of these cases, on 07.10.2023, multiple teams of SIT have conducted raids and searches in 9 different locations, including places belonging to 4 police officers and 2 other persons.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the searches, 4 laptops, 8 mobile phones, 2 NAS storage devices, 10 hard drives, 5 pen drives, 1 memory card and other relevant documents were seized. Investigation is continued in these cases,\u201d it added.\n\nOne of the original investigators, Sridhar Poojar, approached the high court last month against a case registered by the SIT over alleged tampering of devices seized from the hacker and his associates in 2020. The high court asked the SIT not to take any \u201caction in the absence of any incriminating material against the petitioner\u201d till October 9. On September 12, the SIT carried out searches at the homes of Srikrishna and two associates, Sunish Hegde, a contractor, and Prasidh Shetty, a close relative of Hegde.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2020, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the Bengaluru police stumbled on the suspected possession of a large quantity of Bitcoins by Srikrishna following his arrest in a case of procuring drugs over the darknet using cryptocurrency.\n\nInvestigation in the drug case led the CCB to file cases against Srikrishna and his high-profile associates for allegedly hacking online poker sites and cryptocurrency exchanges to acquire wealth through illegal means. Sriki\u2019s arrest in November 2020 in the drug case also revealed his role in a July 2019 hacking of the Karnataka government\u2019s e-procurement cell where Rs 11.5 crore was stolen.\n\nThe alleged Bitcoin scam cases involving Sriki and his associates has been at the centre of a political controversy in Karnataka with the Congress party alleging that top leaders of the state BJP and police officials received kickbacks in cryptocurrency after the arrest of the hacker and his associates in 2020 by the Bengaluru police \u2013 when the BJP was in power.\n\nOn June 30 this year, the Karnataka Police under the new Congress government set up the SIT to probe the alleged Bitcoin scam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn statements given to the police, the hacker has claimed that he gave away Bitcoins that were in his possession to the police following his arrest in 2020. \u201cI understood the case scenario that even if I do not give them the Bitcoins they can use forensic methods to find the Bitcoins after a talk with the investigating officer. So post consultations I voluntarily accepted (sic) to give away the Bitcoins which I had kept in various wallets in different cryptocurrencies,\u201d reads a statement attributed to Sriki which is a part of the chargesheet in one of the cases filed against the hacker in 2021.\n\nEarlier this week, the SIT arrested three persons \u2013 Harwinder Singh, Nithin Mesharam and Dinesh Patel \u2013 who were involved in helping the hacker gang launder the Rs 11.5 crore that was stolen from the Karnataka e-procurement portal in July 2019.\n\nThe ED had earlier filed a chargesheet regarding the laundering of the funds stolen from the e-procurement portal where a total of Rs 1.43 crore is reported to have been recovered. A special court hearing PMLA cases has issued summons to all 19 persons named by the ED in the laundering of funds.\n\nThe hacker and three associates have also approached the Karnataka High Court seeking to quash the e-procurement cell hacking case on the grounds that the investigation was conducted by a police inspector when a Superintendent of Police and Deputy Superintendent of Police are notified as officers in charge of the CID cybercrime station."
