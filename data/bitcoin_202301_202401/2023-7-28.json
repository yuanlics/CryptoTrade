        "content": "The upcoming $2 billion Bitcoin (BTC) monthly options expiry on July 28 could potentially establish $29,500 as a support level. Some argue that the recent United States Federal Reserve interest rate increase to 5.25% had a detrimental effect on risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin bulls believe that the full impact of a tighter economic policy takes time to influence the markets.\n\nBitcoin daily price movements during option expiries. Source: TradingView\n\nLooking back, the monthly expiry on June 30 did not cause significant volatility, given that Bitcoin had already experienced a 22.2% gain between June 15 and June 23. Conversely, the May monthly expiry triggered a 9% rally, with Bitcoin\u2019s price rising from $26,100 on May 25 to $28,450 on May 29.\n\nIn contrast, the options expiry in April resulted in a 7% correction, as Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped from $29,900 on April 27 to $27,800 on May 1. This data clearly indicates that the impact of options expiry takes a few days to consolidate but eventually becomes highly relevant for setting trends.\n\nBulls have regulatory and the ETF momentum on their side\n\nThere are multiple spot Bitcoin ETF requests from some of the world\u2019s largest fund managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity. In addition, on July 26, a U.S. House committee approved a pair of bills aiming to clarify the distinctions between securities instruments and digital commodities.\n\nThe recent positive corporate earnings also support the bullish momentum in risk-on markets. Along with the latest Consumer Confidence data, they strengthen the argument that the risk of a recession is diminishing, at least in the short term. For starters, Meta Platforms reported $32 billion in 2Q revenues, surpassing the market\u2019s estimates.\n\nSeveral other companies have also reported earnings above consensus, including McDonald\u2019s, Coca-Cola, Google, Johnson & Johnson, Morgan Stanley and Novartis. As for the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index, the metric reached its highest level in two years, reaching 117 in July, up from 110.1 in June.\n\nData shows bulls were excessively optimistic on Bitcoin price\n\nThe open interest for the options expiry on July 28 is $2 billion. Still, the actual figure is expected to be lower because some bullish traders anticipated price levels of $31,000 or higher. This excessive optimism stemmed from Bitcoin trading above the resistance level from July 13 to July 24.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for July 28. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.56 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $1.3 billion in call (buy) open interest and the $740 million in put (sell) options. Yet, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $29,500 at 8:00 am UTC on July 28, only $137 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $30,000 or $31,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nBitcoin bears aim for sub-$29,000 to secure some profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on July 28 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit.\n\nThis crude estimate disregards more complex investment strategies. For instance, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nBetween $27,000 and $28,000: 1,100 calls vs. 10,000 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $240 million.\n\n1,100 calls vs. 10,000 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $240 million. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 3,000 calls vs. 6,800 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $110 million.\n\n3,000 calls vs. 6,800 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $110 million. Between $29,000 and $31,000: 6,500 calls vs. 6,600 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options.\n\n6,500 calls vs. 6,600 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options. Between $31,000 and $32,000: 15,400 calls vs. 3,800 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $360 million.\n\nNote that the bulls\u2019 best shot requires a 5.5% price increase ahead of the July 28 expiry to secure a profit. On the other hand, bears only need a modest 2% correction below $29,000 to come out ahead on the monthly expiry. However, the potential profit of $110 million doesn\u2019t justify a large effort for the bears. Moreover, given that Bitcoin has recently failed to break the $29,000 support level, the most probable outcome for the expiry is a neutral area near $30,000.\n\nWhen analyzing a broader mid-to-long-term scenario, Bitcoin bears may have the upper hand due to the added incentives of higher fixed-income returns resulting from the reduced 3% inflation and increased interest rates. But, considering the overall bullish momentum in the economy, there\u2019s actually a favorable outlook for Bitcoin to break above $31,000 in the following weeks.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Will Bitcoin Be a $1 Trillion Cryptocurrency by 2030? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There are a number of stocks that have reached the $1 trillion market cap club, including Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Getting in on these businesses early could have led to life-changing returns.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, reaching this level is rare.\n\nBut with a current market cap of about $570 billion, Bitcoin (BTC 0.47%) is by far the world's largest cryptocurrency, so it has the highest chance to hit the 13-figure mark among the tens of thousands of digital tokens out there.\n\nCan this happen by 2030? I think it's certainly possible. Here's why.\n\nBitcoin has done it before\n\nIn 2021, the cryptocurrency market was on fire, almost tripling that year. And, unsurprisingly, Bitcoin soared as well. In November that year, the top digital asset reached a market cap of $1.2 trillion, more than double where it stands today.\n\nTo be clear, just because an asset reached a milestone in price before, it doesn't necessarily mean that it can do it again. This happens all the time with stocks, and it's a good thing for investors to remember.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has gone through multiple wild cycles ever since its launch in 2009. And the longer it remains relevant, the more confidence I have in its ability to stay alive. This is called the Lindy effect.\n\nAnd the longer it stays alive, the greater the likelihood that it continues to rise over time. That's mainly due to more people becoming more educated about, and wanting to own, an asset that has a fixed supply cap of 21 million.\n\nBitcoin is ready to do it again\n\nThere are also some catalysts on the horizon that can push up Bitcoin's price. The most obvious one is next April's halving, which is when Bitcoin's supply growth rate gets cut in half. Bitcoin typically starts rising several months before this event, and this momentum usually carries over several months after the halving.\n\nThe Federal Reserve aggressively started hiking interest rates early last year to slow soaring inflation. And in the past few months, inflation has started to cool. This means that there is a possibility that the central bank not just pauses, but even reverses and begins to cut rates. A looser monetary policy stance can certainly be a boon to risky assets, especially Bitcoin.\n\nLonger-term, there are also some compelling reasons to believe that Bitcoin can skyrocket over the next several years. One of the most important bull arguments is that a larger number of institutions will enter the Bitcoin market. Recently, leading asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. I don't think they'd make these moves if their clientele, which collectively holds trillions of dollars, didn't have an interest in gaining more exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nAnd speaking of the SEC, that agency and others should adopt more definitive rules and regulations in terms of policing the cryptocurrency industry. Some critics can argue that this will hurt the industry. But I think it could prove to be a catalyst for Bitcoin that can help bring it into the mainstream.\n\nLooking at the return potential\n\nIf Bitcoin reaches a $1 trillion market cap by 2030, that implies its price rises at a compound annual rate of 8.4% between now and then. In the last seven years, by comparison, its price has increased at an annualized clip of 72%, making the forward expected return nothing to rave about.\n\nThe S&P 500 has averaged a 9% to 10% historical return. Do I think Bitcoin can outperform the overall market's past performance in the future? Yes, I'd bet on this scenario happening without hesitation.\n\nBy the end of this decade, Bitcoin's valuation could far exceed $1 trillion, making now a great time to consider buying this leading cryptocurrency."

        "title": "Bitcoin is in the summer doldrums. Here's what to expect in August. - CNBC",
        "content": "Chalk it up to the summer doldrums, perhaps, but for weeks nothing has been able to make the bitcoin price budge and investors may be in for more of the same in August. There's plenty to look forward to on the other side of the break, however. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is on pace to finish July down about 3.5%, according to Coin Metrics, after surging 12% in June. In the latest week, bitcoin closed lower by 1.9%. That was its fifth straight weekly decline and worst week since June 9. Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from the 4:00 p.m. ET stock market close one Friday to the next. The third quarter that ends Sept. 30 is also, historically, the weakest for bitcoin. The average third-quarter gain going back to 2014 is just 4.67%, according to CoinGecko, and it's posted a positive third quarter in only four of the nine quarters since bitcoin's inception. \"August is a quiet month for traditional market investors and crypto is no different,\" said Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, the crypto subsidiary of Stone Ridge Asset Management. \"Historically, mean returns have waned as we go into the summer months and that may play out again in August.\" But even with the latest downdraft, bitcoin is still up about 77% for the year, and investors are upbeat. There's a good amount of potential upside for bitcoin thanks to the XRP ruling , legislation advancing in Congress, bitcoin ETF applications and the upcoming bitcoin halving in the spring of 2024. All that suggests bitcoin's price in six months \"is likely to be materially higher than it is today,\" according to Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals. More immediately, however, \"It's likely we're going to see more treading water over the next several weeks, simply because no news is likely to emerge,\" Edelman said. \"[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair] Gensler is not likely to change his public stance on crypto, the SEC is not likely to rule on the Bitcoin ETF applications, Congress is not likely to release major legislation. Yet all the signs toward those eventualities remain strong so everyone is in a waiting game and that will likely persist through the rest of the summer.\" The outlook was bright to start July: In June, BlackRock filed an application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, injecting new hope into the market. That was shortly after the SEC brought two lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase , which most market participants hoped would help force some regulatory clarity, as well as the long-awaited XRP ruling. Even as trading volumes and liquidity remain stuck, the industry is ending the month on a high note as well, now that Congress after this week has four crypto bills heading to a full House vote for the first time: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Keep Your Coins Act. Continued interest rate increases by central banks, most recently the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank , are giving investors added reason to add to their bitcoin positions, Edelman said. Bitcoin traded in tandem with tech stocks for nearly all of last year, but its correlation with the Nasdaq broke down this year as it returned to its status as a noncorrelated asset. The Fed this week hiked interest rates a quarter percentage point to their highest level in more than 22 years. Although policymakers indicated at their June meeting that two more rate hikes were to be expected this year, the majority of the market is anticipating the Fed is finished tightening. \"As the markets continue to express uncertainty about whether or not there will be a recession or a correction in the stock market, investors are looking for ways they could hedge their diversified portfolios,\" Edelman said. \"Investors are unlikely to find bargains, meaning that there is more argument for significant increases coming than significant decreases,\" he added. \"There's not a lot of reason for worry that bitcoin prices might fall 20% or more. That argues for adding to your positions today.\" \u2014CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed reporting."

        "title": "From Accessibility to Adoption: How Bitcoin ATMs Simplify Access to Crypto - DailyCoin",
        "content": "When entering the crypto ecosystem, investors have a few available methods of buying crypto. Bitcoin ATMs have established themselves as a convenient and swift system for entering the crypto market, and their popularity ensures that their functionalities will not be easily replaced.\n\nHowever, as the Bitcoin ATM operators are looking for ways to expand operations, operating and upgrading the infrastructure remains a long-term objective to engage customers and offer benefits that other methods fall short of. Supporting the less tech-savvy newcomers provides a gateway to wider crypto adoption and shapes the future Bitcoin landscape.\n\nCan they be enhanced, resist the challenges, and keep up with the competition?\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin ATMs and How Do They Work?\n\nBitcoin ATMs have been instrumental in making smaller transactions more accessible and feasible. These devices provide a beginner-friendly and easy access point to digital assets, much like traditional cash ATMs. They allow users to buy or sell cryptocurrencies with cash or credit cards, and their interface is similar to conventional ATMs, providing clear and concise navigation instructions, often in more than one language.\n\nCurrently, there are two types of Bitcoin ATMs: unidirectional, which supports either buying or selling the cryptocurrency, and bidirectional, which supports both options. Users can easily buy their cryptocurrency or sell it for cash within seconds, making them a convenient method for getting instant cash.\n\nThe Rise Of Bitcoin ATMs: Market Trends and Statistics\n\nThe trend of Bitcoin ATMs started in 2013 when the first ever bidirectional crypto kiosk was manufactured by Robocoin and installed in Vancouver, Canada. After a quick palm security scan test, it allowed its customers to exchange Canadian dollars for digital currency and vice versa.\n\nThis event marked a milestone in Bitcoin adoption, and since then, the number of these machines has grown rapidly. According to coinatmradar.com data, there are currently 36.156 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide.\n\nThe United States ranks top globally with 30.621 Bitcoin ATMs, accounting for 84.7% of the global market.\n\nCanada, the home of the first ever Bitcoin ATM, now only accounts for 7.5% of the total ATMs globally.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin ATM market has been affected by the crypto winter of 2022/23, with over 3,000 machines going offline in March 2023, representing a negative change of \u2013 6.6%. During the crypto winter, the market experiences chaos and unexpected fluctuations that can wipe out billions of dollars in investor value. To survive, most crypto companies aggressively cut costs and jobs. Although the number of Bitcoin ATMs globally has decreased, the net change has always remained positive, showing continuous growth. However, since February 2023, the number of closed ATMs exceeded new installations, resulting in a negative net growth of -2.6%, which continued throughout March. April, May, and June witnessed a revival as the ATM industry experienced a return to positive growth, ranging from 1% to 2%.\n\nThe decline in the number of open Bitcoin ATMs in spring was mainly attributed to the arrest of the management of Bitcoin of America, which operated roughly 2,500 locations across the US. Bitcoin of America\u2019s CEO now faces multiple charges for money laundering, conspiracy, and receiving stolen property. Although the charges against the company were only in Ohio for operating without proper licenses, reports from users suggest that locations across the country were also affected and closed, as reflected in the current statistics.\n\nDespite the global short-term decline in installations, there was some positive news from Australia on the Bitcoin ATM front. Roy Morgan\u2019s Research Institute reports that over 1 million Australians own cryptocurrency. In contrast to other regions, such as Europe and the United States, Australia has been steadily increasing the number of Bitcoin ATMs, surpassing Asia with 549 machines in July 2023.\n\nThough there are challenges, the rise of Bitcoin ATMs globally shows a continued growth in adoption and a growing interest in cryptocurrency.\n\nBenefits Of Using Bitcoin ATMs: A Comparison with Traditional Crypto Exchanges\n\nAccording to a recent study by TripleA, a company acting as a crypto payment gateway, 82% of U.S. cryptocurrency owners are aged between 18-44, with only 7% being 55 or older. This indicates that younger Americans largely own cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency demographics also appear to be very similar for other continents and countries.\n\nThis is likely due to younger people being more tech-savvy and more comfortable with the early adoption of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies. Older generations may be more comfortable investing in traditional asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate, which have been around for much longer and are more established.\n\nBitcoin ATMs can provide an easy on-ramp for less tech-savvy and more mature customers by simplifying the buying process and increasing accessibility. Some of the benefits are:\n\nFirstly, they represent the only physical access point for digital assets. Older and more traditional generations may be uncomfortable using complex technology like cryptocurrency exchanges. Bitcoin ATMs provide a familiar and accessible interface similar to traditional ATMs, acting as a bridge between physical FIAT money and Bitcoin. Often installed and located in public places, these machines are more accessible to older customers who might not be familiar with centralized exchanges. The Coin ATM Radar website provides a convenient way to find Bitcoin ATMs located nearby through geolocation detection.\n\nThese generations are also more likely to prefer cash payments in their everyday transactions; providing them with an option of directly exchanging cash for cryptocurrency could simplify the process of accessing the cryptocurrency market.\n\nNew users, beginners, and the less tech-savvy will presumably start with smaller transactions as they enter the new and unknown industry with caution. Bitcoin ATMs provide a convenient method for making smaller transactions, offering valuable insights and experience needed to gain more confidence in the cryptocurrency in the future. These smaller transactions are often processed instantly with little to no registration requirements or limitations. Many of these machines also offer the option to scan a customer\u2019s wallet for instant transfers or will generate a new wallet for a customer if they do not currently own one. This facilitates the transaction process and ensures a smooth experience. As users gain more experience and confidence in the cryptocurrency market, they can gradually start making larger investments to diversify their portfolios. Unlike traditional crypto exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs offer a simple and accessible way to enter the market and make smaller transactions, including buying Bitcoin.\n\nAside from being secure and regulated, these services offer beginner-friendly support through 24/7 customer service and step-by-step instructions and guidance on setting up a Bitcoin wallet, scanning the QR code, or answering any questions or concerns that might arise from the process of obtaining the cryptocurrency.\n\nBanking the unbanked is often hailed as one of many benefits of Bitcoin. Bitcoin ATMs contribute to this principle by allowing users without a bank account to access cryptocurrency. It certainly provides financial freedom for many individuals who live in areas without proper bank access or who do not have the requirements to open and possess a bank account. It benefits those who, for various reasons, avoid banks and prefer staying off the grid.\n\nMany users avoid centralized exchanges due to their reputation for being custodial and their complex account setup process. To comply with regulatory requirements, the majority of these exchanges require KYC documentation \u2013 Know Your Customer policy, where users are asked to scan and provide their personal documents as a way of identity verification. Unfortunately, these institutions are a single point of failure and have been frequent targets for hackers and theft. Many privacy-concerned experts warn of the risks of providing sensitive personal documentation to third parties. Mt. Gox, Equifax data breach, and KuCoin are just a few of the hacks that happened, resulting in thousands of bitcoins stolen and the personal data of millions exposed. A great deal of Bitcoin ATMs will not require registration up to a certain amount, and no account is necessary.\n\nFinally, smaller transactions done via Bitcoin ATMs carry a smaller risk for investors than larger transactions. During volatile and unfavorable market conditions, investors may be hesitant to invest large sums of money into Bitcoin but are also more willing to invest small amounts. Market analysis data shows that smaller bitcoin wallets, so-called shrimps, continued trading and remained very active during the worst days of crypto winter in December 2022.\n\nA Few Important Points to Remember When Using a Bitcoin ATM\n\nBitcoin ATMs are generally secure, using encrypted protocols to protect users\u2019 transactions and personal information. Most Bitcoin ATM operators comply with strict regulations and security measures.\n\nHowever, much like handling cash and using traditional ATMs, users should take precautionary measures to ensure their safety. Avoid using them in poorly lit or isolated areas and using ATMs by unfamiliar operators. Also, always be aware of your surroundings.\n\n\n\nIf a Bitcoin ATM is used to create a paper wallet, it will provide a customer with a private key needed to access the Bitcoin on the blockchain. Private keys must be stored in a safe and secure place, as anyone with access to a private key can access the Bitcoin in a wallet. Maintaining the same level of caution as with a debit card PIN when handling crypto wallet private keys is crucial. Leaving the Bitcoin in the paper wallet provided by the Bitcoin ATM is not recommended. Using a secure wallet and transferring the funds to that wallet is a much safer and recommended practice.\n\n\n\nWhen choosing a wallet, make sure it is a noncustodial open-source wallet that supports Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is a blockchain, and transactions on a blockchain are immutable. Unlike wire transfers, where erroneous and mistaken payments can be canceled, BTC transactions cannot be canceled or reversed. Therefore, checking the transaction details is vital. If the incorrect BTC address is entered, there will be no option to reverse the transaction.\n\n\n\nTransaction fees on Bitcoin ATMs can vary from country to country, with the most frequent being between 10% and 15%. Additionally, there are different fees for buying and selling crypto on Bitcoin ATMs, so check the commission rates before trading. You can find a comprehensive list of all Bitcoin ATM locations with fees included for most of them at the Coin ATM radar website.\n\n\n\nSome Bitcoin machine operators also charge a fixed fee on top of their commission fee. All notifications should be displayed on the Bitcoin ATM before making a transaction. Remember that transaction fees are often higher than those charged by central exchanges, as users also pay for convenience and additional costs related to operating a Bitcoin ATM.\n\n\n\nDo not panic if the Bitcoin you bought does not show in your wallet hours after you complete a purchase at the Bitcoin ATM. The transaction will appear for some wallets the moment a purchase is made or within a minute a transaction is broadcast, but it will be marked as \u201cpending\u201d until there has been at least one network confirmation. This is how the blockchain works; each new block will also confirm a previous one. When a transaction is confirmed, it is included in a block by a miner. The time it takes a transaction to be confirmed depends on the fee used by the sender and the overall network traffic. Sometimes this can take up to two or three hours, but there is no reason for panic. Most wallets are integrated with blockchain explorer, so pending transactions can be tracked in real-time.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, each Bitcoin ATM will issue a ticket containing transaction details, including a transaction ID (TX ID), which you can use to contact a customer service center.\n\nOverall, using a Bitcoin ATM can be a convenient way to buy or sell Bitcoin, but it is important to be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate precautions.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin ATMs: Trends and Innovations to Watch\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is constantly evolving, and the Bitcoin ATM industry is no exception. Flexibility and adaptability are essential to keep up with the rapid pace of change. Taking into account the latest turn of events, especially the last two months, it is clear that several trends and innovations should be on the horizon:\n\nRegulatory certainty is crucial to increasing customer trust in the crypto industry as a whole, as well as the Bitcoin ATM industry in particular. Recent charges against the company, Bitcoin of America, have negatively affected Bitcoin ATM industry statistics. Clear regulations would increase customer security and enhance the overall safety of Bitcoin users.\n\nThere is a need for improvements in Bitcoin ATM operations. Currently, only 23.2% of all worldwide Bitcoin ATMs are bidirectional, allowing both buying and selling crypto. A staggering 27.768 machines are still buy-only, making up 76.8% of the overall Bitcoin ATMs available. As the crypto market is becoming more dynamic and one of its main advantages is its transaction speed, unidirectional ATMs decrease cryptocurrency utility, speed, convenience, and profitability. Subsequently, they result in more time-consuming processes, cause financial losses, and fail to attract more customers to the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIntegration of new cryptocurrencies is also an important trend to watch. Many Bitcoin ATMs now support other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Litecoin, and this trend should continue.\n\nAnother key trend to keep in mind is support for the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Currently, only 254 Bitcoin ATMs support transactions on the Lightning Network, which is around 0.7% of all available Bitcoin ATMs at the moment. Given the fact that the Lightning Network is designed specifically for smaller transactions, reducing the cost and increasing the transaction speed, there is a lot of room for improvement here. Bitcoin adoption could benefit greatly from the Bitcoin Lightning Network, yet many newcomers are confused about how to transfer BTC to Bitcoin Lightning Network wallets. Incorporating the option to change cash to the Lightning Bitcoin immediately on a Bitcoin ATM would facilitate the process of getting familiar with both layer networks. This improvement would benefit the senior generation and younger crypto enthusiasts who are still apprehensive about using the Lightning Network.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin ATMs have revolutionized the way people invest in cryptocurrencies. They offer a convenient and accessible way for users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, providing greater privacy and security than traditional exchanges. They also promote inclusion and reduce the age gap, making new and revolutionary technology such as Bitcoin available to the traditional retail customer.\n\nBitcoin ATMs can contribute to and promote the widespread adoption of Bitcoin and provide and facilitate on-ramp access. Aside from that, they provide a great place for investors looking to get involved in cryptocurrencies as they familiarize themselves and gradually start making bolder decisions.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that there is a growing trend toward mobile apps and online platforms that allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly from their smartphones. While this is convenient, it still poses risks and obstacles for cash users and older generations who may lack information on debit cards and in-app purchases.\n\nEurope is lagging behind America in the number of installed Bitcoin machines (with only 1,465 machines), and no European operators are in the top 10 list of Bitcoin ATM operators. However, with the adoption of the MICAR regulation and more regulatory clarity, Europe is expected to become a more competitive player in the Bitcoin ATM market.\n\nCertain modifications and adjustments will be necessary. Rapid growth and development of the crypto industry will bring challenges and obstacles, which, to thrive further, must be overcome with innovations and valid responses. The Lightning Network adoption and a wider choice of assets are a good starting point for unlocking the full potential of Bitcoin ATMs."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining machines are pouring into Russia amid its war in Ukraine, per CoinDesk.\n\nAs the US market becomes saturated, mining-rig makers have expanded into Russia.\n\nAccording to the report, more mining machines are heading to Russia than anywhere else in the world.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

Hardware manufacturers, according to CoinDesk, have been doing more business in the country, with more mining machines flowing into Russia than anywhere else in the world.\n\nThanks to its cheap energy and cold weather, Russia has long been a hub for bitcoin mining, and after China banned it in 2021, Russia gained even more market share \u2014 all of which has continued amid the war.\n\nAlthough there's risk for foreign firms setting up shop in Russia, the conditions there and improving mining economics remain attractive, blockchain executives said at CoinDesk's Consensus 2023 festival.\n\nNot only that, but heightened regulatory scrutiny and taxes in the US and other countries have made previous options less enticing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo the crypto firm Cryptocurrency Mining Group, Russia will be the only nation to substantially accelerate hashrate growth, or the computational power being delivered to the blockchain.\n\n\"Russia had to divert its energy flow from EU in 2022 and being left with large excess capacity, bitcoin mining can be its new client,\" the company wrote in a report. With cheap energy being a major contributor to mining profits, the region looks poised to develop and attract more business.\n\nSources told CoinDesk that manufacturers Bitmain and MicroBT are active and participating in the Russian market, with Bitmain listing a Moscow office on its website. Both companies, according to the report, offer repair services for local miners in Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, it's possible that wartime sanctions have actually provided a boon to the crypto industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, bitcoin mining offers a different source of revenue for power producers hampered by the weakening economy. Not only that, but the sector facilitates exchanging rubles for bitcoin, which is accepted globally, unlike Russia's local currency."

        "content": "In a Financial Services Committee hearing this week, Rep. Brad Sherman (D\u2013Calif.) had some choice words for bitcoin bros:\n\n\"We are told that cryptocurrency is very innovative,\" said Sherman. \"Look at the incredible financial innovation of Enron and WorldCom,\" he continued, implying that bitcoiners are fraudsters. \"I don't believe that Saratoshi Nagamoto was innovative,\" he added.\n\nHe is, of course, butchering the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person (or group of people) who 15 years ago released the nine-page bitcoin white paper sketching out a \"peer-to-peer electronic cash system\" which would bypass financial institutions and be fully censorship-resistant.\n\nThough bitcoin today is not yet used as a medium of exchange to the degree that many had thought, due to the long processing times of transactions, the Lightning Network is beginning to solve this scalability problem. And the promise of bitcoin delivering financial freedom to all who want it\u2014\"an escape hatch from tyranny,\" in the words of the Human Rights Foundation's Alex Gladstein\u2014is being borne out as it becomes more widely adopted, fulfilling Satoshi's vision.\n\nSherman has previously compared crypto to cocaine and organ harvesting. \"There's this fear of missing out that we gotta keep up with other countries,\" he told Bloomberg back in May. \"Peru is way ahead of us in cocaine production. China is way ahead of us in organ harvesting. We don't need to keep up on those things, and we don't need to keep up on crypto.\"\n\nBrad, did the EU pass comprehensive cocaine legislation? Is Hong Kong encouraging the domiciling of cocaine firms? Are Bermuda and UAE regulators trying to get cocaine firms onshore? Do you think perhaps your metaphor isn't apt? \u2014 nic ???? carter (Orb #2) (@nic__carter) May 10, 2023\n\nSherman, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D\u2013Mass.), who compared buying bitcoin to buying air, seems to fundamentally misunderstand the features of the technology he seeks to regulate (an all-too-common tale for our ancient legislators). In 2021, Sherman said cryptocurrency, which he believes should be considered a security, is considered by advocates to be \"an attack on the powers of society\" when in fact \"the advocates of crypto represent the powers in our society,\" saying that J.P. Morgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs have made so much money off of crypto that it undermines the fundamental proposition. (Tell that to Senegalese app developer Fod\u00e9 Diop, who correctly calls bitcoin \"a weapon for us to fight oppression.\")\n\nSherman has also said that bitcoiners' political contributions to lawmakers would result in regulators going easy on it, which has not turned out to be true.\n\nHere's a hint: If you're getting Satoshi's name wrong, chances are you might not know very much about bitcoin. What else might you be getting wrong?\n\nFor more on U.S. legislators' war on bitcoin, check out this documentary Reason produced last month:\n\nThe post Congressman Talks Smack About Bitcoin Creator 'Saratoshi Nagamoto' appeared first on Reason.com."

        "content": "Buying a call lets you control the same amount of shares as buying the underlying asset with significantly less money. A call buyer pays a premium to the seller for offering protection against bullish moves. The premium paid is the maximum amount the call buyer can lose if the market drops. An at-the-money call is the one whose strike price is closer to the going market rate of the underlying security. For instance, calls at strikes around bitcoin's current market price of $29,180 are at-the-money."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe beginning of the week saw the underwhelming launch of Worldcoin Protocol, along with its native cryptocurrency, WLD.\n\nWorldcoin is co-founded by Open AI CEO Sam Altman and the premise is at once utopian and dystopian: anyone wanting some WLD has to visit an \u201dOrb\u201d\u2014these can currently be found in Berlin, Dubai, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, Seoul, and Tokyo\u2014 and get a snapshot of their eyeballs taken.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis biometric data is used alongside verification of their government-issued ID to confirm someone\u2019s personhood before distributing a set number of coins to them.\n\nWorldcoin believes it\u2019s building the infrastructure to bank the world\u2019s unbanked, enabling everyone \u201cto broadly share the coming technological prosperity \u201d says its website. but many are skeptical, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin who listed \u201cmajor issues\u201d of privacy, accessibility, centralization and security and said it could take years for the protocol to work.\n\nBritish privacy watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) agrees, at least on privacy and security concerns and told Decrypt that it \"[the organization notes] the launch of Worldcoin in the U.K. and will be making enquiries.\"\n\nWLD currently trades for $2.30, about 30% down from its high on launch day of $3.30, according to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko.\n\nThe market leaders\n\nIt was the fifth consecutive week of underwhelming price performance for market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) lost 1.7% and now starts the weekend at $29,291, while Ethereum (ETH) lost 0.9% and changes hands at $1,872.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe market leaders had a pretty static week overall and their prices haven\u2019t moved much since Monday. This week\u2019s news that the Fed was hiking interest rates yet again did not immediately move the leading coins.\n\nLast year, the U.S. central bank hiked interest rates by 75 basis points four times and finished the year with a 50 basis point hike. This year there have so far been two hikes\u2014including Wednesday\u2019s\u2014of only 25 basis points each, but interest rates are now the highest they\u2019ve been for 22 years.\n\nXRP\u2019s recent growth spurt, which was prompted by a small but significant courtroom victory against the SEC a fortnight ago, appears to have settled. Ripple\u2019s cryptocurrency\u2014which is definitely not a security\u2014is down 7.7% for the week and currently trades at $0.70786.\n\nThe only other notable price movement this week came from Toncoin (TON), which fell almost 15% this week to trade at $1.24 at the time of writing.\n\nCrypto politics in Russia, Korea and the U.S.\n\nOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill granting legal tender to a digital ruble, the issuance of which will be overseen by the country\u2019s central bank\u2014although officials say it could take years before the central bank digital currency (CBDC) is widely adopted.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korea rolled out a new interagency investigation unit to tackle crypto crime and take a leading role in investor protection before regulations are implemented.\n\nOperating from the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors\u2019 Office, The Joint Investigation Centre for Crypto Crimes will consist of 30 investigators drawn from several government agencies and bodies, including the prosecutor's office, the Financial Supervisory Service, the National Tax Service, and the Korea Customs Service.\n\nThat day, over in the states, Democrats and Republicans locked horns over the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services committee, assailed the bill as a \u201cwish list\u201d for the crypto industry, and said it undermined the role of the SEC and existing legislation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats also accused the bill of having weak consumer protections, though this point was parried by Republicans like Committee chairman Patrick McHenry (R-NC), who argued that, while not perfect, the bill is \u201cbetter at worst case\u201d than the current regulatory regime.\n\nThe Committee members also debated a stablecoin bill called the \u201cClarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023.\u201d Democrats accuse Republicans of rushing to pass the bill, and Waters said the proposed legislation lacks clarity over the reserves underpinning stablecoins that are pegged to the U.S. dollar."
