        "title": "Bitcoin mining was booming in Kazakhstan. Then it was gone. - MIT Technology Review",
        "content": "Beijing has long been suspicious of crypto, which it sees as allowing citizens to dodge their capital controls and move their money around and offshore using largely untraceable digital tokens. The position was an uncomfortable one in light of the country\u2019s place as the most significant producer of specialized equipment for bitcoin mining and the host of many mining operations.\n\nIn May 2021, the Chinese government announced a crackdown on mining, saying that the amount of energy the industry used was incompatible with the country\u2019s carbon emissions targets. Miners fled to more amenable jurisdictions. Some shipped their gear to the US, particularly to energy-rich, regulation-light states like Texas, but many crossed the border into Kazakhstan, bringing container loads of equipment by road and air. Kazakhstan was suddenly number two in the world for bitcoin mining, making up nearly 20% of the total hash rate, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, a research center in the UK.\n\nThe surge of new users stretched the electricity grid to capacity and beyond. Between January and October 2021, power use grew 8%\u2014four times the typical annual rate of increase. Kazakhstan, which had long been a net exporter of energy, found itself in deficit. There were power cuts in several areas of the country, and the national utility had to buy electricity at inflated prices from Russia.\n\nPower cuts weren\u2019t the main cause of the political turmoil that followed, but they were representative of the many cumulative failures that undermined trust in the government, and ultimately brought people to the streets in January 2022. What started with a demonstration about rising fuel prices snowballed into broader protests about falling standards of living, elite corruption, and the fact that Nazarbayev and his cronies were still believed to be pulling strings in Kazakhstani politics. The government sent riot police, and then Russian soldiers, to put down protests in Almaty. At least 225 people were killed. At the height of the protests the internet was shut down for three days. The impact of the shutdowns on the bitcoin price figured prominently in international headlines. Few observers, if any, reflected on the role that bitcoin mining had played in starting these events.\n\nFormer Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev remained close to the center of the country\u2019s politics, until mass protests in 2022. VASILY KRESTYANINOV/AP PHOTO\n\nUnder pressure to do something to curb the social unrest, the government, led by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, had to be seen to be dismantling the rump of the old regime, and tackling cronyism and corruption. Tokayev promised to build a \u201cnew Kazakhstan,\u201d and people and businesses that previously felt protected by their connections to the old guard were suddenly in the crosshairs of regulators.\n\nShuraev took advantage of the changing political climate, and in March 2022 he released a video on Instagram and YouTube detailing his investigations into Nigmatulin. Nigmatulin would later appear on a list released by Kazakhstan\u2019s Financial Monitoring Agency of more than 50 gray miners who had \u201cvoluntarily\u201d closed down their operations after investigations by the FMA. The grid failures and power shortages created by the industry had become \u201ca threat to the economic security of the country,\u201d the agency said. Nigmatulin did not reply to requests for comment."

        "title": "15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at 15 countries where bitcoin is legal and illegal. For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal.\n\n2022 has been a rough year for businesses, hedge funds, and the stock market but all these have not suffered as much as the cryptocurrency sector. Heralded at one time as the end of traditional fiat money, cryptocurrencies have taken a beating this year as rising interest rates and a souring economic sentiment led investors to flee from the highly speculative market to safe haven investments such as the U.S. dollar and bonds. As an example, Bitcoin, which is the world's leading cryptocurrency, is down by a studding 65% year to date as it nears levels before the pandemic crypto rush that saw capital flow to it from falling stock markets and stimulus checks.\n\nAt the same time, as cryptocurrencies surged, global momentum to make government let businesses accept them as a mode of payment and even as a legal tender grew alongside. However, government warnings about the risk of cryptocurrencies were also proven right just last month when the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX Trading Ltd. led to billions of dollars in losses for its customers. While initially portrayed as an 'honest mistake', charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the firm's founder and former chief executive officer Sam Bankman-Fried claim otherwise. According to a Reuters report, the main reason FTX collapsed was that, allegedly, Bankman-Fried and associates made changes to its algorithm which allowed the exchange's partner hedge fund Alameda Research to continue borrowing from it to make speculative investments even if Alameda's investments and its collateral dropped in value. The vicious cycle that bankrupted the firm started when Alameda's FTT tokens, issued by FTX, collapsed in value after Coinbase sold its holdings. This shattered consumer confidence in FTX and led to a massive withdrawal of consumer funds. However, since FTX had lent this money to Alameda for the investments, it was unable to cough up the cash, which then led to its demise.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe collapse of FTX also knocked the wind out of Bitcoin. After dropping from this year's peak of ~$47,000 to a ~$20,000 level that most analysts thought was the proverbial floor since it cost roughly the same to mine a Bitcoin, the currency would take another beating soon. The drama erupted on November 6th, when Coinbase announced its decision to sell the FTT holdings. Within the next three days as FTX's customers fled, Bitcoin also dropped from $20,905 to $15,757 - a level it was at during November 2022 - effectively wiping out two years of gains and profits for anyone who had entered trading during this time period. Since that fateful day, the currency is up by less than a thousand dollars, with Bitcoin currently worth $16,456 at the time of writing (see best bitcoin stocks to buy).\n\n15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal\n\nBitcoins\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this piece, we have divided the countries into two groups - where Bitcoin is implicitly legal and sometimes also a legal tender, and where it is absolutely banned. The countries where it is banned are listed first. Additionally, the legal frameworks of all countries analyzed for the piece do not differentiate between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, except for those countries that have made Bitcoin a legal tender.\n\n15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal\n\n15. People's Republic of China\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Illegal\n\nThe People's Republic of China is the world's largest economy by one measure and was one of the most popular regions for Bitcoin mining companies this decade due to the widespread adoption of technology. However, spurred into action due to the high environmental costs of mining and illicit activity, the Chinese government banned all cryptocurrency transactions in the country in 2021 when it forbade banks and other institutions from providing services such as clearing and exchange and made mining in the country illegal. However, such was the Bitcoin craze back then that the market simply shrugged off the announcement, and Bitcoin price continued to rise. Yet even though cryptocurrency trading is banned, the holding of it as an asset is protected by Chinese law according to a lawyer.\n\n14. State of Qatar\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Illegal\n\nThe state of Qatar is a Western Asian country located in the Middle East. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are completely banned in the country's Qatar Financial Center (QFC). Qatar states that the reason behind the ban is weak compliance with know your customer (KYC) and anti money laundering (AML) regulations. These regulations are enforced globally by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and they require banks and other financial services providers to verify their customer profiles and determine the source of funds that they are transferring inside and outside the country. In fact, the Qatari Central Bank was quick to warn citizens in May 2022 about dealing with any unregulated financial firm after CoinMENA, a Muslim law compliant exchange launched in the country. Qatar is a Muslim country and follows the Sharia Law.\n\n13. Kingdom of Belgium\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium is a Northern European country with a relatively high GDP per capita. Cryptocurrencies are not outlawed by Belgium and there are no significant barriers to either mining Bitcoin or others or using them for transactions. However, Bitcoin is not a legal tender in the country. Gains resulting from the trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are taxed under Belgium law, and authorities have often warned people about their speculative nature.\n\n12. Republic of Ireland\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is a sovereign state in Europe with a high income and one that is often criticized for its loose tax laws. There is no ban against either Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in the country, and the only regulations covering Bitcoin are those that are in place in the entire European Union. Taxes on Bitcoin are subject to the nature of the transaction, and the rates vary if it is regularly used or if rarely used.\n\n11. New Zealand\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nNew Zealand is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean. There is no specific legislation that bans the mining or trading of Bitcoin in the country. However, like others, New Zealand also taxes cryptocurrency transactions. Exchanges and other businesses must obtain a license from the government before providing services, and taxes are paid for selling Bitcoin if the intent behind the sale and the preceding purchase was to sell the currency and not hold it.\n\n10. Commonwealth of Australia\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Commonwealth of Australia is an Oceanic country that is rich in natural resources. There are no laws against either mining or transacting in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in Australia. However, Bitcoin is not equal to money in the country. Instead, the law treats Bitcoin as an asset that is held, and for companies, this includes taxation if the Bitcoin is part of daily operations or has been bought with the intention of making a profit.\n\n9. Netherlands\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Netherlands is a Northern European country that is one of the most prosperous regions in the world. The country does not have any specific laws to regulate cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin along with others generally has to follow the same regulatory framework for other financial products. The Dutch government also requires that Bitcoins should be disclosed on the annual tax returns and that a capital gains tax will be applied to them. Additionally, companies are required to convert their cryptocurrency payments into the Euro and declare them on the income statement.\n\n8. Swiss Confederation\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Swiss Confederation, commonly known as Switzerland is a landlocked European country with a high standard of living. Cryptocurrencies are classified as intangible assets in Swiss law, are not legal tender, and have no specific laws against in. On the individual level, Switzerland does not tax cryptocurrencies on any capital gains. However, for tax assessment, they must be converted to the Swiss Franc at the year's end at a rate provided by the government.\n\n7. Federal Republic of Germany\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany is a European nation with the largest economy on the continent. Germany requires a license for companies to deal in Bitcoin, and its regulators have called for a global framework to deal with cryptocurrencies as prices plunge globally and more links to established financial institutions are made. Germany also treats Bitcoin as private money, and banks in the country can also store and sell Bitcoin.\n\n6. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a European country located just off of the coast. There is no special regulatory framework for Bitcoin in the country, and the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies by individuals is subject to a capital gains tax which is payable on any gains that are made on disposal. For corporations, Bitcoin taxation in the U.K. depends on the nature of the transactions and whether they are one off or part of daily activity.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal is originally published on Insider Monkey."

        "title": "Crypto mining hurt by falling bitcoin prices, rising energy costs - Marketplace",
        "content": "In late 2021, the price of a bitcoin topped $65,000. Since then, the price has fallen 70% and taken with it the fortunes of the once-burgeoning crypto mining industry.\n\nThose operations are involved in generating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, often using sprawling stacks of computers that require a ton of electricity to stay running.\n\nSome states and municipalities have been vying to attract this industry for years. Others have been less welcoming, with critics charging that they are hurting clean energy goals across the country and around the world.\n\nThe crypto contingent at this month\u2019s CES in Las Vegas seemed eager to show it\u2019s not fazed by the current moment.\n\nSpeakers on a panel called \u201cHow to Stay Warm in a Crypto Winter\u201d were introduced this way: \u201cThese are not individuals who jumped in over the last two years during all of the craziness.\u201d\n\nIn other words: No crypto tourists here \u201cbut really the crypto OGs.\u201d\n\nThis crypto winter started early last year, months before the November collapse of FTX and the arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nFrom the CES convention floor, Sheila Warren, CEO of the industry group Crypto Council for Innovation, acknowledged those events haven\u2019t helped public perception.\n\nStill, \u201cthe thing I\u2019m certainly seeing here at CES is that this isn\u2019t going away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is definitely here to stay.\u201d\n\nBut the industry is certainly in trouble. That\u2019s especially true for the businesses that make their money mining cryptocurrencies. Across North America, shares in many of those firms have crashed, falling 90% or more over the last year.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is probably just the bitcoin price in general. It\u2019s fundamentally a different business when your revenue is cut by 70%,\u201d said Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer at Canadian mining operation Bitfarms.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of a key input shot up as the global energy crisis set in, said Ben Harper of Luxor Technologies, which provides software services to the industry.\n\n\u201cYou have this huge increase in power prices that\u2019s happened over the last year, and that\u2019s squeezed margins from the cost side,\u201d Harper said.\n\nBack when times were good, crypto mining farms were plowing cash into more mining computers. Stacks of them were set to be installed at the sprawling and very loud facility that Marketplace visited in Massena, New York, a year ago.\n\nMore machines are chasing the same prize these days, added Luxor\u2019s Harper. \u201cThe more mining on the number of fixed coins, obviously, the less revenue there is for any miner,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir collective crash has been welcomed by environmental groups organizing against energy-intensive crypto mining.\n\nIn upstate New York, the group Seneca Lake Guardian helped push for the nation\u2019s first statewide partial moratorium on new crypto mining, arguing those projects are at odds with New York\u2019s carbon reduction goals.\n\nA bitcoin mining facility is seen in Niagara Falls, New York in October 2022. The state passed a partial moratorium on new crypto mining late last year. (Geoff Robins/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nYvonne Taylor said crypto\u2019s travails have helped her group gain traction in their local fight against a crypto miner operating at a fossil-fuel power plant in their community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty validating, because we\u2019ve been raising the alarm and shouting our concerns at the top of our lungs for literally years about this facility,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nNorth of the border, two Canadian provinces \u2014 Manitoba and Quebec \u2014 are using different tactics to limit crypto mining.\n\nAnd even though there are still some green pastures for miners, including states that offer subsidies to them, crypto investor Bradley Tusk of Tusk Ventures warns the industry needs a wake-up call.\n\n\u201cThey need to get much more politically sophisticated. If they don\u2019t start to be smarter, more proactive, and more aggressive, they\u2019re going to be completely banned from doing what they do entirely,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nTusk added that\u2019s true for crypto miners \u2014 and the crypto industry as a whole. \u201cIf you don\u2019t step up, you\u2019re gonna get wiped out.\u201d\n\nAlthough there\u2019s new legislation to crack down on crypto mining nationally, for opponents like Thomas Cmar, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, the effort against the industry has largely been a state-by-state fight.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re chasing electricity prices,\u201d Cmar said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to use large volumes of electricity \u2014 regardless of where it comes from \u2014 at a very critical time for our country\u2019s policies on climate.\u201d\n\nEven after a rough year, there\u2019s still plenty of crypto mining activity, Cmar said. And if the crypto miners lose in one state or province, many are prepared to pack up and move to another.\n\nAn abridged version of the above story appeared on a Jan. 19 episode of \u201cMarketplace Morning Report.\u201d You can listen to the condensed audio version below."

Bitcoin last traded at $19,013.30, according to CoinMetrics.\n\nU.S. inflation data out Thursday showed a modest retreat. The consumer price index decreased 0.1% in December on a monthly basis, in line with Dow Jones estimates.\n\nPrices still increased 6.5% year-over-year, however. This was down from a 7.1% jump in November and well off a 9.1% peak rate in June. Investors hope the decline may put pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to reverse interest rate increases.\n\nThe Fed and other central banks have been raising interest rates over the past year or so in an effort to tame soaring inflation, in moves that forced stocks and cryptocurrencies sharply lower in 2022.\n\nThe hope now is that the U.S. central bank will cut rates, taking some pressure off risk assets."

        "content": "Failed crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried invested $1 billion into Genesis Digital Assets, a bitcoin miner in Kazakhstan, just months before the collapse of his FTX platform heralded a crypto winter that's looking more like an ice age.\n\n\n\nBankman-Fried made the investment, the crypto exchange's biggest, through Alameda Research, the FTX-linked hedge fund that's at the center of his firm's bankruptcy, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nKey Takeaways Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Alameda Research invested about $1 billion in Kazakh bitcoin miner Genesis Digital Assets, bankruptcy disclosure has shown.\n\nBankman-Fried joined the board of the mining firm in October 2021, but resigned in November 2022, a day before FTX filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe sizable investment, one of FTX's largest assets, is yet another insight into the FTX collapse, which has irked the crypto community as about 1 million FTX creditors await repayment.\n\nBankman-Fried has defended his dealings as the head of FTX on social media, saying he \"didn't steal funds.\"\n\n$1 Billion On Mining Firm\n\nAlameda invested $1 billion between August 2021 and April 2022 four times: $100 million in August 2021, $550 million in January, $250 million in February, and $250 million in April 2022.\n\nAlameda shelled out half its investment on operations, spending the rest to buy shares held by two Genesis co-founders. Bankman-Fried joined the Genesis board in October 2021 and resigned on November 10, 2022\u2014one day before FTX filed for bankruptcy.\n\nGenesis didn't live up to its name. Bitcoin mining profits slid thanks to falling bitcoin prices, climbing electricity prices, and a high network hash rate. U.S. financier and short-lived Trump spokesman Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge Capital invested more than $60 million in Genesis and cut its stake by 59% between its June high point and September 2022, according to SkyBridge securities filings.\n\nIt didn't help that the Kazakhstan government restricted bitcoin mining, which led the company to move away from the country\u2014 and to the U.S.\n\n\n\nSBF Defends Himself on Substack\n\nBankman-Fried, who is out on bail at his parents' home in California and awaiting trial on federal fraud charges, defended himself on social media this week. He wrote on the email newsletter platform Substack that he's innocent and gave his explanation of what caused FTX's collapse.\n\nFTX and Alameda imploded due to a crypto market meltdown and inadequate hedging on Alameda's part, according to Bankman-Fried.\n\n\"I didn't steal funds, and I certainly didn't stash billions away,\" Bankman-Fried wrote on Substack. \"Alameda lost money due to a market crash it was not adequately hedged for\u2013as Three Arrows and others have this year. And FTX was impacted, as Voyager and others were earlier,'' he concluded.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMeanwhile, FTX's former director of engineering, Nishad Singh, engaged in a proffer session\u2014a meeting between a criminal defendant or suspect and the government outside a court\u2014which will offer him limited immunity. Singh hasn't been accused of wrongdoing. Earlier, former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\n"

        "title": "Gorillas, militias, and Bitcoin: Why Congo\u2019s most famous national park is betting big on crypto - MIT Technology Review",
        "content": "That\u2019s why the park is a vital source for charcoal, or makala in Swahili, and for food\u2014even though farming, fishing, hunting, and logging are all illegal. Park resources are stripped with regularity: between 2001 and 2020, Virunga lost almost 10% of its tree cover, and de Merode estimates $170 million in Virunga\u2019s trees and ivory are lost annually. But the alternative for locals is being unable to pay local warlords or starving. These are perfect conditions for corruption.\n\n\"Congo is a bewildering place to make moral judgments.\"\n\n\u201cCongo is a bewildering place to make moral judgments,\u201d says Adam Hochschild, the author of King Leopold\u2019s Ghost, which chronicles the Belgian monarch\u2019s harrowing 19th-century rule. Congo is further complicated by \u201cits sheer vastness, people who speak hundreds of languages, and the colonization which was done for the purpose of extracting wealth,\u201d he says. \u201cUnder those circumstances, it\u2019s very hard to have a just and fair society.\u201d\n\nCongo has nearly as many displaced people as Ukraine, and decades of conflict despite decades of UN peacekeeping. Most stolen profits from the park go to armed rebel groups, which some locals join for lack of better options. Some are relics of past wars, most notably Rwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide. Others may be linked to the Islamic State. The largest is the M23, a Tutsi-led group so well-armed that the UN says Rwanda backs it. (Rwanda denies this, but its economy relies heavily on Congolese resources.)\n\nAs a result, Virunga may be the only UNESCO site that regularly buries its staff: over 200 rangers have been killed since 1996, on average one a month. Cherubin Nolayambaje, who has spent eight years as a ranger, calls it \u201cthe most dangerous job in the world.\u201d\n\nOver 200 park rangers have been killed since 1996, on average one a month. Here, rangers on early morning patrol look for animal snares, illegal fishing activity, and wood cutting. BRENT STIRTON/GETTY IMAGES\n\nVirunga\u2019s nearly 800 rangers, including about 35 women, often encounter armed rebels in the park and civilians farming or living there illegally. Many locals don\u2019t even know the park\u2019s boundaries, adds Samson Rukira, an activist in the nearby town of Rutshuru. While conservation requires community involvement to solve issues, he says, \u201cwe are in areas which are not secure, and that means maybe rangers can\u2019t be in dialogue.\u201d\n\nDe Merode is sympathetic to community complaints that individuals are being denied access to the park\u2019s vast wealth. \u201cHundreds of thousands, probably millions, of people suffer what we hope is a short-term cost to turn this park into a positive asset. If we fail in that, we do more harm than good,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we believe passionately that it can be turned around\u2014this ecosystem, this park.\u201d\n\nHis plan to do that hinges on the three hydro plants the park has opened since 2013, in Matebe, Mutwanga, and Luviro; a fourth is under construction. If you can power your home, the theory goes, you don\u2019t need to chop trees to cook. Electricity supports new jobs and businesses, like coffee coops and chia seed production. And, of course, the Bitcoin mine.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the misconception we most want to correct: that Virunga is just about the wildlife,\u201d de Merode continues. \u201cNo, it\u2019s about the community through the wildlife. Our role is to try to facilitate that.\u201d There\u2019s no way to practice conservation in one of the world\u2019s most troubled countries without local support, he says."

        "content": "Robinhood will no longer support the bitcoin fork favored by Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who has claimed to be pseudonymous Bitcoin developer Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe move has sent Bitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision (BSV) crashing against BTC, the asset favored by the faction known as Bitcoin Core \u2014 but more often as, simply, bitcoin.\n\nIn an update to users on Wednesday, the trading app said it would end support for BSV on Jan. 25 as part of a routine review of its crypto products.\n\nWith some geographical restrictions, users can continue to trade the token until the deadline.\n\nAfter entirely delisting the token, Robinhood will sell any remaining BSV for market value, and the proceeds will be credited to user accounts under available funds.\n\nBSV rallied alongside BTC against the US dollar Thursday but is down against BTC to levels not seen since the FTX bankruptcy.\n\nBSV/BTC | Source: TradingView\n\nThe latest development isn\u2019t likely to settle any debates about the legitimacy of the crypto in the pantheon of bitcoin forks, but it does remove one of the few remaining venues where BSV can be traded against actual dollars, as opposed to Tether\u2019s USDT. Of the latter, only OKX has significant volume \u2014 $17.5 million in 24-hour volume, per Coingecko.\n\nRobinhood didn\u2019t provide a specific reason for delisting the token, but the trading app has a \u201crigorous framework\u201d in place to regularly vet tokens on its platform.\n\nBitcoin SV was first included under Robinhood\u2019s brokerage in November 2018 after it emerged from the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\nProponents of Bitcoin SV believe that it aims to execute some of the features mentioned in Nakamoto\u2019s white paper that appear to be absent in the original Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLike its predecessors, Bitcoin SV uses a proof-of-work protocol to verify transactions and sports the same maximum supply of 21 million tokens.\n\nIt emerged from political clashes within the Bitcoin Cash community, a little over a year after BCH forked Bitcoin, ostensibly to improve upon the scalability of the protocol and reduce transaction fees which, at the time, were quite high.\n\nAside from Wright, Bitcoin SV is championed by Canadian entrepreneur Calvin Ayre, who has described it as the most valuable network in the blockchain space. Ayre reacted to Robinhood\u2019s delisting of BSV as \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n\nWright meanwhile described the trading app as \u201cdishonest,\u201d saying \u201cthe last thing [Robinhood wants] is a system that stops their frauds.\u201d\n\nWright and the future of his \u201ccreation\u201d\n\nSpeaking of allegations of fraud, Wright lost a Norwegian libel suit in October that he launched against someone who called him just that for his unproven claims to be Satoshi.\n\nA subsequent defamation suit against podcaster Peter McCormack ended in December and also went against Wright, who was ordered to pay McCormack\u2019s legal fees.\n\nAnd in a blow to Wright\u2019s Satoshi narrative, Justice Chamberlain \u2014 the judge that oversaw Wright\u2019s case against McCormack \u2014 emphasized that it is \u201cimportant to be clear that Dr. Wright has not established that he is Satoshi\u201d \u2014 a detail not previously driven home at Wright\u2019s other trials.\n\nJustice Chamberlain also wrote that \u201cDr Wright had advanced a deliberately false case until shortly before trial,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen the falsity was exposed, he changed his case, explaining that he had made inadvertent errors. I rejected that explanation as untrue.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the ruling, Wright seemed to imply that he would back off on the idea of making his case to be Satoshi in court, instead appealing to the court of public opinion in a Twitter thread that begins, \u201cOne day, people will understand,\u201d and continues, \u201cI no longer care what you think. I care for my wife, my mother, and my family. I seek to see my creation used.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, his lawyers are still busy in the UK suing Bitcoin developers to try to force them to help Wright gain access to Satoshi\u2019s dormant bitcoins, which Wright claims were rendered inaccessible due to a case of lost private keys. That case is awaiting a ruling on jurisdiction before possibly proceeding to try the merits of the legal claim on the facts.\n\nThrough all this, Bitcoin SV is still ranked the 52nd cryptocurrency based on its market capitalization of around $804 million as of Thursday at 2:30 pm ET, according to data compiled by Blockworks. The token lost as much as 15% on Wednesday before rebounding strongly today along with the rest of the crypto market following the CPI data release by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company also said it would look to implement a redemption program to help narrow the discount that\u2019s plagued the fund since early 2021, and would pursue a listing on the New York Stock Exchange."

        "content": "Bitcoin prices to start the new year have been slightly leaning towards the upside. However, it could be another volatile year for the cryptocurrency market as it slowly limps into 2023.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies have crept into the new year, licking their wounds after the carnage of 2022,\u201d reported Reuters. \u201cThe overall global crypto market cap has risen 5% to $871 billion since Jan. 1, but it\u2019s still down over 57% from this time last year.\u201d\n\nTo end 2022, bitcoin was stuck in a sideways motion trap. It\u2019s been relatively quiet in terms of volatility, but that could just be the proverbial calm before the storm.\n\n\u201cBitcoin itself has gained 4.3% since the start of 2023, though stuck in a narrow range between $16,500 and $17,300,\u201d the report added. \u201cThe world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency is eerily subdued, with its 7-day volatility dropping to levels not seen since October 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.\u201d\n\nPatience Is Required\n\nWith the cryptocurrency market entering a maturation phase, especially after last year\u2019s drubbing, gone are the days where quick and easy gains could be attained. Analysts are preaching patience in a cryptocurrency market that could be headed for another year of fluctuating price movements \u2014 an environment where patience is indeed a virtue.\n\n\u201cIt will be a year for the patient, as we do not anticipate prices nearing former all-time highs in 2023,\u201d said Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at Arcane Research, in the same Reuters report.\n\nOne of the biggest indicators of potential upside, or even downside, is trading volumes. The activity in cryptocurrency trading volumes could provide insight on what to expect for 2023, and right now, volumes are relatively staid, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency spot trading volumes remain similarly muted after slumping about 48% in December versus the previous month to $544 billion, their lowest level since December 2019, CryptoCompare data showed,\u201d reported Reuters.\n\nThat\u2019s not a surprising metric given last year\u2019s downside in the crypto market, which could have essentially provided the digital assets market with a much-needed cleansing. Given the bull run in 2021, speculation was reaching fever pitch, especially with the entry of institutional money.\n\nThat said, a new type of investor could emerge amid the chaos. One that focuses on bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a long-term growth option as opposed to a fly-by-night money-maker via high-speed trading \u2014 that could be a good thing for the crypto market in order for it to survive in the long run as a viable asset alongside stocks, bonds, and other traditional asset classes.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "title": "From Bernie Madoff to Bankman-Fried, Bitcoin maximalists have been validated - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Long before Bitcoin (BTC), Bernie Madoff sat atop the longest-running, largest fraud in history. The rise and real-time fall of Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried, former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, were expedited in comparison. While the similarities are profound, the storyline is not: Create organizations under false pretenses, develop relationships with people in authority positions, defraud clients, survive as long as possible, and try not to get caught.\n\nMadoff advisers experienced a \u201cliquidity\u201d problem in 2008, around late November into early December, where the fund was unable to meet client redemption requests. On its surface, the fourth-quarter timing of the Madoff collapse more than a decade ago appears eerily similar to FTX\u2019s 2022 implosion. Bitcoiners who hold their keys will never experience a \u201cliquidity problem,\u201d as their Bitcoin isn\u2019t being used to leverage anything else. It is the hardest money around as long as it stays in the custody of its rightful owner.\n\nEven near the collapse, Madoff had planned to pay out $173 million in early bonuses to family and friends. When questioned by his sons on Dec. 9, 2008, Madoff confessed to the massive fraud. The numbers, in many instances, are fractions of the fraud FTX is accused of. Bitcoin maximalists continue to remind their communities that yield, third-party custodians and humans cannot be trusted. Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s white paper endures.\n\nMadoff\u2019s sons communicated, almost immediately, with an attorney, who advised them to contact federal authorities. Madoff was arrested on Dec. 11, one day after federal agencies were made aware of the fraud.\n\nRelated: The outcome of SBF\u2019s prosecution could determine how the IRS treats your FTX losses\n\nOn Nov. 8, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced on Twitter that he tentatively intended to purchase FTX, but he quickly reversed the decision, and a \u201cliquidity\u201d problem ensued at FTX. Bitcoin maximalists either watched idly, shaking their heads in disbelief \u2014 knowing it was a matter of time \u2014 or simply went on with their lives. Many maximalists might very well have been a part of Mt. Gox, which held approximately 80% of all BTC in circulation at the time it was breached. The \u201cwake-up call\u201d is an unfortunate initiation ritual for some Bitcoiners. FTX will mint many new Bitcoin maximalists.\n\nIn December, SBF was arrested in the Bahamas. As authors and researchers, we\u2019re confident that correlations will be immediately identified and explored in regard to the timing of Madoff\u2019s arrest on Dec. 11, 2008.\n\nAs SBF faces extradition to the United States, based upon the \u201cTreaty Between the United States and the Bahamas,\u201d he faces sentence terms that may mirror Madoff\u2019s, who faced a 150-year prison sentence for an arsenal of convictions. Those convictions included:\n\n40 years for two counts of international money laundering\n\n20 years for one count of securities fraud\n\n20 years for one count of mail fraud\n\n20 years for one count of wire fraud\n\n20 years for one count of false filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n\n10 years for one count of money laundering\n\nFive years for one count of investment adviser fraud\n\nFive years for one count of false statements\n\nFive years for one count of perjury\n\nFive years for one count of theft from an employee benefit plan\n\nTo provide some perspective, the longest sentences for recent financial fraud include, in order:\n\nShalom Weiss (845 years)\n\nNorman Schmidt (330 years)\n\nBernie Madoff (150 years)\n\nFrederick Brandau (55 years)\n\nA tie for fifth place between Charles Lewis, Eduardo Masferrer, Chalana McFarland and Lance Poulsen, who received 30-year sentences.\n\nBased on the limited release documents at the time of publication, SBF may have his name included on the top five listed above \u2014 even potentially at or near the top. That would be fair considering that, among other allegations, his political donations may have impacted or influenced U.S. political elections.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s time for crypto fans to stop supporting cults of personality\n\nMadoff\u2019s prisoner number was 61727-054. Note that these oddly hyphenated eight digits weren\u2019t representative of an account number, an SEC filing record or some secretive financial code; the numbers were Madoff\u2019s former inmate number at Federal Correctional Complex, Butner.\n\nIf and/or when the time comes, SBF may be remembered by a similar numeric value instead of a cheeky three-letter moniker (\u201cSBF\u201d). Time will tell. Remember, Madoff pleaded guilty and still received 150 years, eventually dying while in custody.\n\nBitcoin > bribes\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Not your keys, not your coins.\n\nStop giving your hard-earned money and Bitcoin to \u201ctrusted\u201d third parties. Whether or not SBF spends a day in prison, or multiple lifetimes, the future of SBF means nothing to Bitcoin maximalists. In truth, if SBF walks free, the event will only confirm a greater Ponzi scheme that Bitcoiners are well aware of.\n\nBitcoin maximalists continue to preach, and events such as the collapse of FTX (among numerous other exchanges) are dire reminders of Nakamoto\u2019s words that kicked off the introduction of Bitcoin\u2019s white paper: \u201cCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties. [\u2026] While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.\u201d\n\nThere were and continue to be many lessons to be learned when examining the greed, lack of empathy and overall corruption humans have witnessed throughout history; and as events of this magnitude unfold, at the heart of every failure is trust \u2014 or a lack thereof.\n\nBitcoin's market capitalization from 2013-2023. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nBitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work model \u2014 including but not limited to how transactions occur, timestamps are recorded, hash rates adjust, the network broadcasts nodes, incentives are rewarded, verification occurs and privacy is encoded \u2014 is the solution many Bitcoiners have come to take comfort in. The trust lies in the protocol rather than in individuals. Time and time again, a broken world and unscrupulous actors make the case for a trustless system.\n\nRelated: From the NY Times to WaPo, the media is fawning over Bankman-Fried\n\nNo matter how well-regulated, designed or engineered future financial systems, exchanges or \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d claim to be, they all have the same failure point: human nature and greed.\n\nBitcoiners realize this, and as many more become aware of financial fraud \u2014 whether impacted directly or indirectly \u2014 Bitcoin continues to emerge as the most obvious solution. SBF may teach a new generation of \u201cinvestors\u201d the same hard lesson learned by their parents: When something is too good to be true, it often is.\n\nThe failure of FTX is not a surprise, nor are the potential connections between SBF and high-ranking officials. The fact that punishments may not fit the crime(s) shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, either. In truth, maximalists realize that Bitcoin will be around long after the SBF dust has settled. Bring on the next Ponzi scheme \u2014 Bitcoin maximalists appear immune.\n\nKenneth Minesinger is a professor of law at California Baptist University.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price has gained 15% in the past 13 days, and during this timeframe, traders\u2019 bearish bets in BTC futures were liquidated in excess of $530 million compared to bulls.\n\nAfter rallying to $19,000 on Jan. 12, Bitcoin reached its highest price since the FTX exchange collapse on Nov. 8. The move was largely fueled by the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) expectation for December, which matched consensus at 6.5% year-over-year \u2014 highlighting that the inflationary pressure likely peaked at 9% in June.\n\nFurthermore, on Jan. 11, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich said $5 billion in cash and liquid cryptocurrencies had been recovered \u2014 fueling hopes of partial return of customer funds in the future. Speaking to a U.S. bankruptcy judge in Delaware on Jan. 11, Dietderich stated that the company plans to sell $4.6 billion of non-strategic investments.\n\nLet\u2019s look at derivatives metrics to understand whether professional traders are excited about Bitcoin\u2019s rally to $19,000.\n\nMargin use increased as Bitcoin price rallied to $18,300 and above\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned, and margin is beneficial to some investors because it allows them to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nFor instance, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only short the cryptocurrency as they bet on its price declining. Unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn\u2019t always matched.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio firmly increased on Jan. 11, signaling that professional traders added leverage longs as Bitcoin rallied toward $18,300.\n\nMore importantly, the subsequent 2% correction on Jan. 12 that led Bitcoin to a $17,920 low marked the complete margin reversal, meaning whales and market makers reduced their bullish positions using margin markets.\n\nPresently at 21, the metric favors stablecoin borrowing by a wide margin, indicating that bears are not confident about opening Bitcoin margin shorts.\n\nFutures traders ignored the Bitcoin price pump\n\nThe long-to-short metric excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets. In addition, it gathers data from exchange clients\u2019 positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how professional traders are positioned.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges' top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nEven though Bitcoin broke above the $18,000 resistance, professional traders have kept their leverage long positions unchanged, according to the long-to-short indicator.\n\nFor instance, the ratio for Binance traders stood firm at 1.08 from Jan. 9 until Jan. 12. Meanwhile, top traders at Huobi reduced their leverage longs as the indicator moved from 1.09 to the present 0.91. Lastly, at crypto exchange OKX, the long-to-short slightly increased favoring longs, moving from 0.95 on Jan. 9 to the current 0.97.\n\nTraders using futures contracts were not confident enough to add leveraged bullish positions despite the price increase.\n\nRelated: 13% of BTC supply returns to profit as Bitcoin sees 'massive' accumulation\n\nBitcoin price could retest $17,300\n\nWhile the margin data shows that sizable leverage was used to push Bitcoin above $18,000, it suggests that the situation was only temporary. Most likely, those professional traders deposited more margin and consequently reduced their leverage after the event. In essence, the metric looks very healthy because it indicates that margin markets are not overbought.\n\nAs for the top trader\u2019s long-to-short, the absence of demand for leverage longs using futures contracts is somewhat concerning, but at the same time, it leaves room for additional purchasing power.\n\nFrom a derivatives standpoint, even if Bitcoin retests $17,300, the bulls should not be concerned because the derivatives indicators show little demand from short sellers and no excessive leverage from buyers.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Are you interested in getting involved in the cryptocurrency market but don\u2019t know where to begin? Have you heard about Bitcoin and Ethereum, but aren\u2019t sure if you can buy one with the other? Look no further! In this blog post, we\u2019ll be exploring the ins and outs of buying Bitcoin with Ethereum.\n\nHow to buy bitcoin with ethereum\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are both digital currencies that are becoming more widely accepted. Since these two virtual coins are both popular with investors, it makes sense to explore the possibility of using one to purchase the other. By understanding how to buy bitcoin with ethereum, you can open up a new way of investing that could help you grow your portfolio.\n\nWhen it comes to buying bitcoin with ethereum, there are several steps that must be followed in order to complete a successful purchase:\n\nGet a suitable Ethereum wallet: Make sure the wallet you choose is secure and allows you to make purchases safely. Some wallets may also require the use of two-factor authentication or other forms of security. Connect your wallet directly to an exchange: Most exchanges allow users to transfer funds directly from their Ethereum wallets without having an intermediary party involved in the transaction. Calculate fees: Before making any purchases, make sure you understand what fees might be associated with your transaction, especially if you\u2019re buying from an exchange that isn\u2019t based in your own country or jurisdiction. Buy Bitcoin through an exchange: After connecting your Ethereum wallet to an exchange and calculating any applicable fees, you can then start buying Bitcoin directly from the platform by placing prices accordingly and responding quickly when those higher offer prices come along!\n\nHow to find the best bitcoin exchange to buy bitcoin with ethereum\n\nWhen deciding which Bitcoin exchange to use, it is important to consider a few factors:\n\nAmount of Bitcoin that the exchange offers and the fees associated with buying or selling them.\n\nthat the exchange offers and the fees associated with buying or selling them. Liquidity of the exchange and how quickly it can be bought or sold.\n\nof the exchange and how quickly it can be bought or sold. User reviews \u2013 are there any customer service issues or bug reports that can help you make a decision?\n\n\u2013 are there any customer service issues or bug reports that can help you make a decision? Security of each exchange and whether or not there have been any prior hacking attempts.\n\nFinding a reliable Bitcoin exchange requires research into available exchanges, particularly those that accept Ethereum as an alternative payment method in addition to fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Some popular exchanges offer both crypto-to-crypto trading along with fiat-to-crypto trading while others may have only one option available. Many exchanges also offer margin trading (trading on leverage) which may significantly increase your risk but can also potentially bring higher profits if handled well. Leverage should only be used by advanced traders who understand its risks!\n\nMany users choose to secure their own wallets as best protection against theft or losses due to scams; this will require additional research into best practices for securely storing cryptocurrency assets safely offline before making trades on any given platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to buying Bitcoin with Ethereum, it is important to evaluate the costs and benefits. Exchange rates vary from exchange to exchange, and the fees associated with buying or trading cryptocurrencies can add up quickly. It is recommended that potential buyers research the different exchanges available and use caution when transferring funds from one platform to another.\n\nMany exchanges offer users the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin with Ethereum through a cryptocurrency contract for difference (CFD). Before investing in crypto-assets, users should be aware of the risks associated with trading and ensure that they are comfortable assuming those risks. With careful attention and due diligence, it can be possible for investors to safely buy Bitcoin using their Ethereum holdings."

        "content": "Billionaire Mark Cuban believes an age-old market manipulation tactic could be the next thing to rock the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n\"I think the next possible implosion is the discovery and removal of wash trades on central exchanges,\" the longtime crypto investor tells TheStreet.\n\nA wash trade is when a trader buys and sells the same financial asset multiple times in order to generate fake volume and make it appear as if there is a high demand for the asset. This artificially inflated demand can mislead other traders into investing real money into the asset.\n\nSince higher demand typically leads to higher prices, traders can use this process as a type of \"pump-and-dump\" scheme: When the price is as high as the trader thinks it can go, they can cash out and leave other investors with the asset that's declining in value.\n\nAlthough wash trading has been illegal within traditional U.S. financial markets for decades, it's likely difficult to crack down on the activity within the crypto space."

        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC) hit a yearly high of $21,095 on Jan. 13, where is it headed next?\n\nBitcoin is currently witnessing an uptick in bullish momentum after the positively perceived Consumer Price Index (CPI) report was followed by a strong rally across the crypto market.\n\nThe recent rally in Bitcoin is creating increased volume levels and higher social engagement on whether the price is in a breakout of fakeout mode.\n\nIs the Bitcoin bear market over?\n\nWhile the market is still technically in a bear market compared to last week, investor sentiment is improving. According to the Fear and Greed Index, a crypto-specific metric that measures sentiment using five weighted sources, investors\u2019 feelings about the market hit a monthly high.\n\nBitcoin Fear and Greed index. Source: alternative.me\n\nBitcoin price is now above the psychologically important $21,000 level and many analysts and traders are issuing their thoughts on where BTC price could head next.\n\nLet\u2019s explore a few of these perspectives.\n\nBitcoin trading volumes remain a concern\n\nBitcoin price has yet to recover from its pre-FTX levels but reached above $21,095 on Jan. 13 for the first time since Nov. 8, 2022. Despite the strength of the recent rally, some analysts believe BTC price needs to remain above the $21,000 support before the current bullish trend can be sustained.\n\nAccording to Glassnode analysis:\n\n\u201cA renewed bullish trend that started on January 1st drove bitcoin to the $18.6 - $18.9k level, yet a cross over to $19k is necessary to claim a new trading channel around $19-$21k. Resistance is expected around these levels as bitcoin faces a mid-term downward trend. If the price fails to break over the trend line, we expect a retrace toward the $16-$17k area.\u201d\n\nBTC price compared to volume. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe lack of trading volume of around $18,000 shows the weakness in the current on-chain and centralized exchange (CEX) activity. The largest volumes and overall activity seem to surround the $16,000 level, suggesting that is a more solid floor than the current price range. With less volume surrounding levels higher than $21,000, Bitcoin\u2019s rally could be capped at $21,095.\n\nIs it just a bear market rally?\n\nBitcoin is still facing headwinds including massive exchange layoffs in a tightening macro economy, Gemini and Genesis legal issues and the potential establishment of a U.S. House crypto-focused subcommittee.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) is currently showing BTC as overbought. According to RSI analysis, a sharp downtrend may form as the price corrects.\n\nBitcoin RSI. Source: TradingView\n\nThe macro markets are also at major resistance levels. The United States Dollar index (DXY) is at key support which means risk assets like Bitcoin may start to see a sell-off if the index recovers. Bitcoin remains correlated to equities and the SPX mini futures index is also showing signs of a pullback.\n\nTraderSZ explains below:\n\n$BTC - huge resistance here...dxy at key support...ES looking like it could pullback abit, eth at macro mid range...been up only all week so could get some profit taking/pullback....arrow would be my trigger IF it follows plan pic.twitter.com/6JziAmBywH \u2014 TraderSZ (@trader1sz) January 12, 2023\n\nWith Bitcoin investors taking profits as suggested by TraderSZ, it may be tough for BTC to reach higher levels.\n\nHistorical analysis points to a new Bitcoin bottom\n\nBitcoin is currently below its 200-week moving average and according to independent market analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin price may have already hit its macro bottom according to historical data.

Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong (SAMHK), a subsidiary of Samsung's investment arm Samsung Asset Management, is set to list the \u201cSamsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF\u201d on the Hong Kong stock market on Jan. 13.\n\nThe move comes amid a surge in interest from both the government and institutional investors in the region.\n\nThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Source: The Trade\n\nThe ETF, or exchange-traded fund, will track the spot price of Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin futures products listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The ETF will primarily invest in the CME Bitcoin Futures, with some investments in the CME Micro-Bitcoin Futures.\n\nCurrently, Hong Kong is the only market in Asia where Bitcoin futures ETFs can be traded. The Samsung Bitcoin Futures ETF joins the Hong Kong Crypto Futures ETF, which began trading to the tune of $70 million in 2022. Other markets worldwide include Canada, the U.S., Australia and some European countries such as Switzerland.\n\nPark Seong-jin, head of Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong, commented:\n\n\u201cHong Kong is the only market in Asia where Bitcoin futures ETFs are listed and traded in the institutional market. It will be a new option for investors who are interested in Bitcoin as a competitive product that reflects their experience in risk management.\u201d\n\nThis ETF listing will provide retail and institutional investors with a new way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which may help to attract more mainstream investors to the cryptocurrency space. With Samsung\u2019s reputation and brand power, the ETF could be an attractive option for investors who are looking for a way to invest in Bitcoin without buying and holding their own private keys directly.\n\nThe move by Samsung comes as the price of Bitcoin surpassed the $18,000 level, indicating a potential rise in positive sentiment among traders.

Its flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S22, comes with a blockchain wallet preinstalled.\n\nThe ETF is a further indication that the global brand with a market capitalization of $300 billion is looking to capitalize on the growing interest in cryptocurrencies."

That rally to $1 trillion was followed by a 27.6% correction in three days and it invalidated any bullish momentum that traders might have expected.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has gained 15.7% year-to-date, but a different scenario has emerged for altcoins, with a handful of them gaining 50% or more in the same period. Some investors attribute the rally to the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on Jan. 12, which confirmed the thesis that inflation was continuing to drop.\n\nWhile the macroeconomic conditions might have improved, the situation for cryptocurrency companies seems gloomy. New York-based Metropolitan Commercial Bank (MCB) announced on Jan. 9 that it would close its crypto-assets vertical, citing changes in the regulatory landscape and recent setbacks in the industry. Crypto-related clients accounted for 6% of the bank\u2019s total deposits.\n\nOn Jan. 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged cryptocurrency lending firm Genesis Global Capital and crypto exchange Gemini with offering unregistered securities through Gemini\u2019s Earn program.\n\nA final blow came on Jan. 13 after Crypto.com announced a new wave of staff layoffs on Jan. 13, reducing the global workforce by 20%. Other crypto exchanges that recently announced job cuts in the last month include Kraken, Coinbase and Huobi.\n\nDespite the dreadful newsflow, the macroeconomic tailwinds favoring risk assets ensured that only UNUS SED (LEO) closed the first 13 days of 2023 in the red.\n\nWeekly winners and losers among the top 80 coins.

Exchanges use this fee to avoid exchange risk imbalances.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. However, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on Jan. 13. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 7-day funding rate was near zero for Bitcoin and altcoins, meaning the data points to a balanced demand between leverage longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers).\n\nIf bears are paying 0.3% per week to maintain their leveraged bets on Solana (SOL) and BNB (BNB), that adds up to a mere 1.2% per month \u2014 which is not relevant for most traders.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price rallies to $19K, but analyst says a $17.3K retest could happen next\n\nTraders\u2019 demand for neutral-to-bullish options has spiked\n\nTraders can gauge the market\u2019s overall sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30%, which is bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options by 40%, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: laevitas.ch\n\nBetween Jan. 4 and Jan. 6, the protective put options dominated the space as the indicator soared above 1. The movement eventually faded and the opposite situation emerged as the demand for neutral-to-bullish call options has been in excess since Jan. 7.\n\nThe lack of leverage shorts and demand for protective puts points toward a bull trend\n\nConsidering the 15.7% gain since the start of 2023, derivatives metrics reflect zero signs of demand from leverage shorts or protective put options. While bulls can celebrate that the $900 billion total market capitalization resistance faced little resistance, derivatives metrics show bears are still patiently waiting for an entry point for their shorts.\n\nConsidering the market's bearish newsflow, the bulls\u2019 main hope remains solely in the framework of a favorable macroeconomic environment, which largely depends on how retail sales data reports next week.\n\nChina is also expected to release its economic figures on Jan. 16 and the U.S. will do the same on Jan. 18. Another potential impact on price could be the United Kingdom\u2019s CPI print which is set to be announced on Jan. 18.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that the Valkyrie Bitcoin mining ETF is highly \u201cconcentrated,\u201d with investment in only 20 firms, including Argo Blockchain, Bitfarm and Intel, among other notable names.\n\nThe WGMI ETF was listed on the Nasdaq in February 2022 but didn\u2019t invest directly in BTC. 80% of its net assets offer exposure through the securities of companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue or profits from BTC mining. Valkyrie invests the rest of the 20% in companies holding \u201ca significant portion of their net assets\u201d in Bitcoin.\n\nEquity ETF market performance. Source: Bloomberg\n\nThe first Bitcoin ETF to be approved in the United States was ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in October 2021, which tracked Bitcoin prices through futures contracts traded on the CME marketplace. The first ETF gained a lot of early market traction, seeing $1 billion in trading volume on its first day. This made many believe that the success would eventually convince regulators to approve the first spot market-based ETF in 2022. However, a prolonged crypto winter and crypto contagions turned the tide against the crypto ETFs.\n\nCryptocurrency-related ETFs became the two worst-performing ETFs in Australia in 2022, with the same story playing out in the United States. According to ETF.com, the top four worst-performing ETFs in the U.S. in 2022 were crypto-related.\n\nRelated: Grayscale CEO highlights 20% GBTC share buyback option if ETF conversion fails\n\nCrypto ETFs were seen as the next big step for the crypto industry to drive mainstream adoption.

But I would argue that, you know, places like Asia, particularly Hong Kong, are starting to look pretty attractive with their virtual asset policies, [...] with their desire to basically be a leader in the space.\u201d\n\nA lack of regulatory clarity has often been cited as the reason why so much crypto activity is leaving the United States, and has prompted lawmakers to push for crypto regulations as soon as possible."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss went from being the co-originators of Facebook deceived by Mark Zuckerberg (as dramatized in the film \u201cThe Social Network\u201d) to early crypto adopters who became \"Bitcoin billionaires.\" Now their firm has been charged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe SEC hit the twins\u2019 cryptocurrency exchange Gemini with charges of securities violations on Thursday due to its Gemini Earn program, which promised a return to customers who deposited their crypto holdings. Genesis, its lending partner in the program and a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), was also charged in tandem with Gemini.\n\nThe charges come after several weeks of increasingly public disputes between Gemini and DCG leadership following November\u2019s collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which triggered a fresh wave of industry contagion as funds stored on FTX were either locked away or missing. Genesis is reportedly on the hook for more than $900 million worth of Gemini customer funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow did it come to this? Here\u2019s a look at the Winklevoss twins\u2019 rapid rise in the crypto industry and the recent moves that led to a public spat between Gemini and DCG, the SEC charges, and an apparently vast hole in Gemini\u2019s finances.\n\nFounding Gemini\n\nThe Winklevoss twins received some $65 million in cash and Facebook stock in the 2008 settlement over the creation of the social media giant. After establishing family office Winklevoss Capital in 2012, the brothers began amassing large amounts of Bitcoin. The twins owned as much as 1% of the circulating supply of the leading cryptocurrency as of November 2013, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThey went from buying up a stash of Bitcoin to leading an investment round in BitInstant, an early Bitcoin exchange whose founder Charlie Shrem was later imprisoned for money laundering related to the Silk Road marketplace. Also that year, the twins attempted to launch the first-ever Bitcoin ETF (or exchange-traded fund), which was rejected by the SEC.\n\nIn 2015, the Winklevoss brothers opened Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange licensed in its home state of New York. The platform expanded over the years and acquired NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in 2019, ahead of the eventual NFT market boom in 2021. Parent company Gemini Space Station was valued at $7.1 billion as of November 2021.\n\nCameron and Tyler were deemed \u201cBitcoin billionaires\u201d for the first time in 2017 (as chronicled in the Ben Mezrich book of the same name) as Bitcoin\u2019s price surged to nearly $20,000, and Forbes currently estimates each brother to have a net worth of $1.1 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut with the crypto industry in turmoil over the past several months, Gemini and its founders have faced new challenges. In June 2022, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged Gemini \u201cfor making material false or misleading statements\u201d as it sought approval of its Bitcoin futures product, and Gemini laid off 10% of its staff as the crypto market tumbled.\n\nGemini vs. Genesis\n\nA fresh wave of crypto industry turmoil sparked Gemini\u2019s recent troubles, kick-started by the early November collapse of crypto exchange FTX and sister trading firm Alameda Research.\n\nSoon after, Genesis announced that it would suspend customer withdrawals from its lending arm due to the \u201cFTX impact,\u201d citing \u201cunprecedented market turmoil\u201d in being unable to continue business as usual. Genesis was Gemini\u2019s partner for its interest-bearing Earn product, and Gemini said that it would have to freeze customer funds as a result.\n\nIn December, the Financial Times reported that Genesis held some $900 million worth of customer funds from the Gemini Earn program. Digital Currency Group\u2014which owns Genesis, Grayscale Investments, and other crypto firms\u2014is allegedly dealing with liquidity problems, according to Cameron Winklevoss, although founder and CEO Barry Silbert has assured investors otherwise.\n\nAt the start of 2023, the private negotiations between Gemini and Genesis spilled into public when Winklevoss penned an open letter to Silbert. In the letter, he accused Silbert of \u201cbad faith stall tactics\u201d towards finding a resolution to the dispute over the funds, suggesting evasive tactics on the part of the DCG head. Silbert denied the accusations.\n\nThe allegations intensified on January 10 as Cameron Winklevoss called for Silbert\u2019s resignation, suggesting misrepresentation and accounting fraud at DCG. The company responded by calling Winklevoss\u2019 claims \u201canother desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt\u201d on the part of the Gemini founders, which it said were \u201csolely responsible for operating Gemini Earn and marketing the program to its customers.\u201d\n\nGemini then announced that it had officially terminated its Earn program, which it said would force Genesis to pay back what it said is over $900 million worth of customer funds that it holds. The program had operated for nearly two years in partnership between Gemini and Genesis.\n\nSEC charges\n\nThat situation remains unresolved as of this writing, but now both Gemini and Genesis both face a new hurdle in the form of the SEC charges related to Gemini Earn. The agency alleges that the firms sold unregistered securities to customers, raising billions of dollars\u2019 worth of crypto in the process from hundreds of thousands of users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We allege that Genesis and Gemini offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. \"Today's charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws.\"\n\nIn a tweet response, Tyler Winklevoss questioned the timing of the charges, saying that Gemini had been in discussions with the SEC for 17 months and that the program was regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services.\n\n1/ It\u2019s disappointing that the @SECGov chose to file an action today as @Gemini and other creditors are working hard together to recover funds. This action does nothing to further our efforts and help Earn users get their assets back. Their behavior is totally counterproductive. \u2014 Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) January 12, 2023\n\n\u201cDespite these ongoing conversations, the SEC chose to announce their lawsuit to the press before notifying us. Super lame,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that they\u2019re optimizing for political points instead of helping us advance the cause of 340,000 Earn users and other creditors.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cGemini has always worked hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations.\u201d Genesis and DCG have yet to comment on the SEC charges."

That price represents a gain of 8.05% in one day, as the asset was priced close to $17,561 just 24 hours ago.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s sudden gains may be due to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) update that was released earlier today. That report matched estimates of 6.5% year-on-year inflation, and Bitcoin prices more or less remained stable at the time of the report.\n\nAnticipation of the CPI report also gave Bitcoin a foundation to build on earlier today.

He called this an \u201cexcellent opportunity for HOLDers to sell\u201d Bitcoin for gold.\n\nThough Schiff\u2019s prediction has not yet proven correct, it is of course possible that Bitcoin will lose value in the near future.\n\nBitcoin is, as always, the largest cryptocurrency by a wide margin. However, its sudden price gain has also helped it climb the ranks against stocks and other traditional assets. With a market capitalization of $365 billion, it briefly became the 20th largest asset, ranking above Mastercard (MA) and Facebook or Meta (META).\n\nThe asset\u2019s growth has also led to gains elsewhere in the crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) is up 6.7% over the past 24 hours, while the crypto market overall is up 5.5%."

        "content": "Bitcoin is in the accumulation zone according to the BTC pricing model.\n\nDemand for BTC experiences a recovery as hopes for a recovery bloom.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] investors are going through renewed hope for a long-term recovery. As such, it is important to juxtapose those expectations with an economic outlook. Perhaps this might help gauge whether it is indeed logical to expect a major rally in 2023 and 2024.\n\nHow many Bitcoins can you get for $1?\n\nBefore getting into debt and inflation concerns, one must first look at why long-term bullish expectations are gaining traction. Bitcoin\u2019s pricing model revealed that Bitcoin has been trading below its realized price since September 2022. This is significant because as per BTC\u2019s past performance, a price dip under the realized price marked the end of the bearish cycle.\n\nIf the same expectation is true, then Bitcoin is currently at or near the bottom range. This is the same range where accumulation is bound to take place. This is further reinforced by the MVRV ratio, which is still below one, meaning it is still oversold.\n\nCan Bitcoin thrive amid economic recession concerns?\n\n2022\u2019s biggest lesson for the crypto market was that economic factors have a heavy hand in Bitcoin\u2019s performance. Will history repeat itself if the U.S cannot combat inflation? According to economic analyst Sean Foo, the government has been borrowing money to combat inflation.\n\nThe battle against inflation may bring about an extra debt burden and discourage lenders. Such an outcome might lead to higher inflation and a dive into economic recession. But what will be the impact on Bitcoin? It all depends on the state of the dollar.\n\nAs more countries threaten to abandon the dollar as the global reserve, a likely outcome would be a shift in favor of hard money. Gold is currently the preference, but perhaps gold might find favor with the masses in such a scenario.\n\nAre your BTC holdings flashing green? Check the Bitcoin profit calculator\n\nThe state of Bitcoin accumulation\n\nAn analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s supply in profit revealed that more traders were in profit since the start of January 2023. Roughly 11.2 million BTC is in profit, which means that this is an amount that is in private addresses already. Roughly 7.66 million BTC was at a loss at press time.\n\nThe amount in loss dropped substantially in the last 10 days, implying that a significant amount had been accumulated since the start of the month. This confirmed that many BTC investors were optimistic about the prospects of a rally in 2023. But nothing is cast in stone, and things may not necessarily turn out as expected, especially now that there is less liquidity in the market."

        "title": "Have the Bitcoin Variants Faded from Existence? - Securities.io",
        "content": "There are over 100 different Bitcoin variants or hard forks. Some popular variants still in existence include Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. The Bitcoin code is open source, therefore, its code could be forked to create a different version.\n\nMost of the Bitcoin variants were created to solve scalability and security issues perceived by some members of the Bitcoin community. Oftentimes, there are divisions in the Bitcoin community when a core-code-changing or parameter-altering upgrade is proposed. The debates these proposed upgrades cause in the Bitcoin community leads to the forking of the Bitcoin network sometimes.\n\nBitcoin variants are created from a hard fork of the Bitcoin network. When changes are proposed to an existing blockchain, the changes are carried out either through a soft fork or a hard fork.\n\nA soft fork is a type of backward-compatible upgrade to a blockchain network. A soft fork does not change the underlying rules or the parameters of a blockchain. An example of a soft fork is SegWit \u2013 a soft fork change in the transaction format of Bitcoin.\n\nA hard fork is a type of radical upgrade to a blockchain network. When there is a hard fork, a chain is split; miners and validator nodes choose which chain they continue to validate. A hard fork leads to the creation of a new blockchain network from the existing blockchain. Hard forks often occur to add a proposed functionality, to a blockchain to correct a security risk, or to roll back blockchain transactions.\n\nAn instance where blockchain transactions were rolled back was in 2016. The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization built on Ethereum, was exploited by attackers. Part of the Ethereum community decided to roll back all the DAO-related transactions, allowing the DAO contributors to reclaim their funds. Some members of the Ethereum community supported the hard fork to roll back the transactions, while others were against it. After the controversial hard fork, the newly created blockchain retained the name Ethereum (ETH), while the existing (old) blockchain is now known as Ethereum Classic (ETC),\n\nA detailed article on the difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic can be found on Securities.io.\n\nNotable Bitcoin Hard Forks\n\nMost of Bitcoin\u2019s hard forks are mainly a result of proposed upgrades to improve the security, scalability, and decentralization of the network, or to solve a perceived problem. Some hard forks that were initially successful have been altogether abandoned by their communities and seen zero adoption; others are still actively traded on exchanges and fairly used in peer-to-peer (p2p) transactions.\n\nBitcoin XT\n\nBitcoin XT was launched in 2014 by Mike Hearn, a former Bitcoin developer. The hard fork hoped to solve the Bitcoin scalability issues by an increase in block size. The proposal was formalized in Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 101 (BIP 101). Bitcoin XT hard fork launched in August 2015; its block size was 8 megabytes \u2013 an eight times increase from Bitcoin\u2019s 1-megabyte block size.\n\nDespite initial interest in Bitcoin XT, with over 1,000 nodes running the Bitcoin XT software, users\u2019 and node operators\u2019 interest in the new Bitcoin fork waned very quickly as major miners refused to support the project.\n\nThe Bitcoin XT hard fork influences Bitcoin fork proposals to this day. Subsequent hard forks have mostly implemented a block size increase.\n\nBitcoin Gold\n\nMoving away from block size contention typically witnessed in Bitcoin forks, Bitcoin Gold\u2019s hard fork sought to make Bitcoin a more decentralized network. Bitcoin Gold uses the proof-of-work consensus algorithm similar to its pre-fork version. However, Bitcoin Gold favors mining on less specialized hardware.\n\nBitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm and favors ASIC mining equipment, which is expensive to procure and run. Bitcoin Gold uses the Equihash algorithm and supports GPU mining, or mining using a graphics card. Bitcoin Gold aimed to make crypto mining more accessible.\n\nThe developers and supporters of Bitcoin Gold argue that as Bitcoin is only mined using expensive hardware, it creates the possibility of having only a handful of miners control the network, which goes against the tenets of decentralization. By allowing mining operations on less expensive, more available hardware, more miners could join the network, reducing the chances of a 51% attack \u2013 an attack on a crypto network in which a miner or a group of colluding miners control more than 50% of the network\u2019s hash rate. When a miner or group of miners own or control more than 50% of the network, it could lead to double-spend and other network vulnerabilities.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nRelentlessly following in Bitcoin XT\u2019s footsteps, Bitcoin cash sought to make the Bitcoin network scalable by increasing the block size of the network. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s block size is 8 megabytes, similar to that of Bitcoin XT.\n\nBitcoin Cash came about in May 2017 following discussions in the Bitcoin community to implement a scaling solution known as the Segwit2x upgrade. This led to debates within the Bitcoin community. SegWit2x was never implemented. Those in favor of a larger block size decided to create the hard fork called Bitcoin Cash.\n\nBitcoin Cash was designed to be a cheaper and peer-to-peer system. The block size of Bitcoin Cash is dynamic \u2013 it increases over time. The Bitcoin Cash block size started at 8 megabytes but has since grown to 32 megabytes block size.\n\nBitcoin SV\n\nBitcoin Satoshi Vision (SV) was not a direct hard fork of the Bitcoin network; it was a hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash network. Bitcoin SV was created by Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, the controversial self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakomoto. Just like most hard forks that preceded it, Bitcoin SV was created to solve the scalability problem PoW blockchains face.\n\nBitcoin SV started with a block size of 128 megabytes. Less than a year after its creation, the Bitcoin SV network underwent an upgrade called Quasar. The upgrade increased the network\u2019s block size to 2 gigabytes. Seven months into the Quasar upgrade, there was another upgrade to the Bitcoin SV network which was called the Genesis update: this update removed the block size limit altogether, making Bitcoin SV scalable to any possible size.\n\nHow have the Bitcoin Hard Forks Fared?\n\nA common motive for creating these forks is to introduce a supposedly more secure and scalable system that would overtake Bitcoin in adoption and popularity. So far, none of the Bitcoin forks has been able to topple Bitcoin and its dominance.\n\nSome of these Bitcoin forks have ended up becoming hard-forked as a result of carry-over debates among community members; even after becoming a fork the scalability debate still lingers in the communities of the fork-created blockchain, often leading to a further split.\n\nIn terms of developer activities, Bitcoin has a larger number of active developers compared to its hard-forked versions. Bitcoin has also greatly improved in scaling its network using layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network \u2013 a lightweight, fast, and scalable network built on top of Bitcoin \u2013 and upgrades like SegWit and Taproot.\n\nOf all the Bitcoin hard forks, Bitcoin Cash has managed to maintain relevance over the years. Its native coin BCH is still actively traded on major crypto exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.\n\nIn the latest development, Robinhood, in an email to customers, announced that it will end support for Bitcoin SV. Users have been given a deadline of January 25 to convert or sell their BSV. Robinhood said its decision is based on its regular review of the cryptocurrencies it offers on its platform. Similarly, BTG, the native coin of Bitcoin Gold, was delisted from Binance in October 2022. The delisting and end of support of these Bitcoin variants on major crypto platforms and exchanges clearly indicate their lack of adoption and use.\n\nBitcoin has, however, maintained its status as the undisputed crypto king over the years, gaining the attention of and investments from retail and institutional investors alike.\n\nTo learn more about Bitcoin, visit our Investing in Bitcoin guide."

        "title": "How Marathon, Riot, MicroStrategy, and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Soared This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, companies and funds with direct ties to the crypto market are having a great week as the leading cryptocurrency finally had some good news to report. Here's how a handful of securities intimately related to Bitcoin (BTC 2.33%) fared this week, counting from Wall Street's closing bell at 4 p.m. ET last Friday to the corresponding bell time on Thursday, Jan. 12:\n\nFor those unfamiliar with these crypto-friendly securities, Marathon Digital (MARA -2.18%) and Riot Platforms (RIOT -1.36%) specialize in mining new Bitcoin tokens with renewable energy and ultra-specialized computer rigs. MicroStrategy (MSTR 7.35%) is a data analytics business that has converted essentially all of its cash reserves into Bitcoin, pouring more cash into the cryptocurrency through new debt, stock sales, and cash flows from the software business. Finally, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -1.01%) is neither a company nor a stock but a closed-end fund that holds nothing but Bitcoin on its balance sheet. These are four of the largest concentrated Bitcoin holdings on the planet.\n\nBitcoin itself gained 6.4% over the same period and continued climbing after Thursday's market close. By 8:30 p.m. ET, the oldest and largest crypto had gained 11.2% since Friday afternoon.\n\nSo what\n\nThere was a lot going on in crypto-land this week. Let's stick with a bird's-eye view of Bitcoin's action, as the others based their gains directly on that foundation.\n\nFriday morning's jobs and wage growth report was good but not fantastic, which was exactly what the Federal Reserve was hoping for. The dream scenario these days is a lukewarm economy, allowing the Fed to slow down the pace of interest rate increases. That was good news for high-risk investments, including Bitcoin and the securities mentioned above.\n\nBullish signs for the global economy continued to amass as the week progressed, supported by positive financial reports and cautiously optimistic comments from federal regulators. And then, Bitcoin went for a more obvious bull run on Thursday for several reasons. The morning's inflation report showed stabilizing trends. South Korean tech giant Samsung's Hong Kong-based asset management arm unveiled an upcoming exchange-traded fund based on Bitcoin futures. The government of El Salvador passed a complex new law to regulate cryptocurrency trading in the country, which adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender last year.\n\nThis flurry brought Bitcoin back to prices not seen since last November, passing $18,000 per coin and briefly peeking above the $19,000 level on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe fund and stocks mentioned above are extremely sensitive to Bitcoin's price moves, amplified by the additional risk these organizations are taking to take full advantage of the cryptocurrency's expected long-term price gains. Marathon, Riot, and MicroStrategy have significantly more debt than cash and may have to sell some Bitcoin from time to time just to keep the lights on.\n\nMany investors expect them to get crushed in periods of weak Bitcoin pricing, with short-selling interest ranging from 20% of all Riot shares to roughly 45% for Marathon and MicroStrategy. And Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holds 631,628 Bitcoins worth approximately $12.0 billion at today's crypto prices, but the fund's total market value is just $7.3 billion. So you can effectively get exposure to Bitcoin at a 40% discount through the Grayscale fund, as investors see more risk than promise in Grayscale's Bitcoin plans.\n\nNow what\n\nDon't get too excited by the Bitcoin stocks' massive weekly gains. They all still trade far below their 52-week highs and even deeper under the multi-year highs they set in November 2021. MicroStrategy, for example, trades stands 61% below its 52-week highs, and that's the mildest price cut on my list. Marathon and Riot shares are down more than 70% each.\n\nAgainst that background, this week's rosy news and surging market action serve as a reminder that these alternative Bitcoin investments come with larger portions of both promise and risk than the cryptocurrency itself. That's fine if you don't mind the elevated risk and volatility, but it also makes sense to see massive short-selling interest in these securities.\n\nIn other words, please tread carefully around these hyper-volatile investment options. Bitcoin miners and dedicated crypto investors can be explosive, both in the \"skyrocketing\" sense of that word and the plain old destructive meaning. As sobering as this thought may be when you remember Bitcoin's wild price swings in years past, buying Bitcoin directly looks like a lower-risk strategy."

        "content": "Bitcoin lacked demand despite the impressive run of the first ten days in 2023\n\nA short term retreat could be likely depending on the CPI outcome as supply in profit spikes\n\nExpecting a return of the Bitcoin [BTC] bull market might sound too hasty despite the king coin resurgence above $17,000. CryptoQuant analyst, Cauceconomy opined this after assessing the condition of the Bitcoin demand.\n\nBTC, which had more green days than reds since 2023 began, had helped renew the enthusiasm of its investors. But for Cauceconomy, a significant breakout might be unlikely.\n\nAre your holdings flashing green? Check the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nTrading volume restraining demand\n\nAccording to his publication on the crypto data insight platform, Bitcoin\u2019s lack of demand could be traced to its network usage. This is because each block confirmation translates to increased daily transactions.\n\nHowever, that has not been the situation lately as miners have not necessarily been profitable to increase productivity by confirming more blocks. Hence, the trading volume has been repressed.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, the BTC 24-hour trading volume was a 1.75% decrease at press time. This aligned with the analyst\u2019s reference to a dip in transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nBesides, Cauceconomy backed up his opinion by citing the historical trend. He pointed out that there was usually a notable breakout during the bear market before the bull season in previous cycles as shown by the above image. Meanwhile the current momentum displayed by BTC has shown nothing of such. The analyst said,\n\n\u201cFor us to have growth in the fundamentals of the network, we will need to see greater demand for trading and, consequently, higher fees for daily transactions. At this time, we haven\u2019t had that breakout yet and trading volume remains low, indicating low demand.\u201d\n\nOn evaluating the Bitcoin addresses with non-zero balance, Glassnode showed that there has been a slight decrease from the peak registered in November 2022.\n\nThe data at the time of writing, reported the number to be 43,170,375. Although this was a marginal difference, it suggested a lackluster perspective towards network utilization user base expansion.\n\nHow many BTCs can you get for $1?\n\nThe cause to take heed\n\nIn addition, another post on CryptoQuant warned optimistic investors of an impending price drop. On-chain analyst Gigisulivan was the one who raised the alarm after his assessment of the supply in profit percentage. At press time, the Bitcoin supply in profit percentage headed towards peaks, and was forming a divergence.\n\nLike Cauceconomy, he also referred to history as situations like that eventually led to a short term BTC pull back. For context, in 2018 and 2019, it only took a few days before the projected outcome happened. So, it might be the case as well considering the present circumstances.\n\nHowever, the analyst mentioned that macroeconomic factors would also have a say in the potential BTC trend. Therefore, the result of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on 12 January could determine if the supply in profit percentage goes ahead with the forecast."

        "title": "Bitcoin vs Bitcoin SV: differences explained - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is the oldest cryptocurrency in existence. It is also the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation. However, over the years, there have been several offshoots of the Bitcoin blockchain. One of them is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). This article will explore the similarities and differences between BTC and BSV, and provide an overview of each currency's history, development, and current status. Let\u2019s begin by first understanding Bitcoin and the problems led to the creation of Bitcoin SV.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): What is it?\n\nLaunched in 2009, Bitcoin was the first decentralised digital currency come into existence. It was created by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. In a nutshell, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network that allows for the transfer of funds without the need for a central authority.\n\nBitcoin's primary goal is to be used as a global digital currency, and its design is focused on providing a decentralized and secure method of storing and transferring value. The currency has a maximum supply 21 million coins, of which more than 19.25 million coins are currently in circulation at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Scalability Problem\n\nScalability is Bitcoin\u2019s Achilles' heel. The network suffers from extremely slow transaction processing speeds. Moreover, if there is a surge in network traffic, transactions begin to pile up and processing fees tend to skyrocket. Currently, Bitcoin is able to process only seven transactions per second. This is no match for other payment networks such as Visa, which can handle up to 24,000 transactions per second.\n\nVarious solutions were proposed to address this problem, including increasing the block size, implementing off-chain scaling solutions, etc. However, to implement these changes, blockchains need to go through a process known as a \u2018fork\u2019. This is when the network splits into two; the new version carries the updated protocol whereas the older network is either abandoned or continues to operate using the old protocol.\n\nBitcoin Forks\n\nThe Bitcoin network has undergone multiple forks over the years. This is because users have put forth several improvement proposals to optimise the blockchain and keep it at par with external developments. Some of the notable Bitcoin forks include Bitcoin Cash (August 1, 2017), Bitcoin Gold (October 24, 2017), and Bitcoin SV (November 15, 2018).\n\nBitcoin Cash was created to implement a larger block size and improve the blockchain\u2019s scalability. Bitcoin Gold was created to make mining more decentralized after large firms began monopolising the mining process.\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV): What is it?\n\nThe proponents of BSV believe that Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s only intended scalability-oriented solution was increased block sizes. This is why they were originally onboard with the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. BCH introduced a larger block size of 8MB which was then bumped up to 32MB. This resulted in higher processing speeds of 116 transactions per second.\n\nHowever, as time went by, the developers behind Bitcoin Cash continued to implement structural changes to their protocol. BSV proponents shunned these changes, resulting in a hard fork that created BSV.\n\nTherefore, Bitcoin SV (BSV) is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) which in turn was a fork of Bitcoin (BTC). BSV was created in November 2018 by a group of individuals led by Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the original creator of Bitcoin. The main goal for BSV proponents was to restore the original Bitcoin protocol. They believe that the original Bitcoin white paper had a much more ambitious vision for the technology than what is currently being pursued by Bitcoin or any of its hard forks.\n\nThis is why they shunned BCH to create a blockchain that\u2019s more in line with Satoshi\u2019s original vision. Moreover, they do not support the current Bitcoin blockchain as it has undergone several network updates which are not in line with Satoshi\u2019s original whitepaper.\n\nHowever, since BSV is an offshoot of the original network, it bears several similarities with Bitcoin we know today. For instance, both blockchains use the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, they both have a circulation hard-cap of 21 million coins, and they also follow 4-year halving cycle. However, there are plenty of features that set the two blockchains apart as well.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of these differences\n\nScalability: One of the main differences between BTC and BSV is their approach to scalability. Bitcoin has a block size limit of 1 megabyte, which limits the number of transactions that can be processed per block. BSV, on the other hand, started with a much larger block size of 128MB. Over time, this has been increased to a massive 4GB.\n\nTransaction per second: As mentioned earlier, BTC can process only 7 transactions per second. However, BSV, with its 4GB block size, can process up to 50,000 TPS.\n\nFees: BTC usually has higher fees than BSV because of the smaller block size limit and a larger number of unconfirmed transactions.\n\nSmart contract support: The original Bitcoin network does not support smart contracts and NFTs. However, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision does and this could hold it in good stead in the future.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin went through a terrible crypto winter last year, the prices have gone up since the beginning of the new year, and at the time of writing, BTC was trading for $18,133.35, recording a value appreciation of 4.06 percent over the previous day. BSV on the other hand was trading at $41.41.\n\nConclusion\n\nBTC and BSV are both digital currencies based on blockchain technology, but there are some key differences between the two. BTC is focused on being a decentralized digital currency for storing and transferring value, while BSV is focused on becoming an enterprise-grade blockchain for business applications.\n\nHowever, the community support for BSV is very minimal. It's one of the reasons why mainstream crypto exchanges like Binance, Robinhood and Bitfinex are delisting BSV from their platforms. So, while BSV does have the potential to grow, its future looks far from certain."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn round five of the legal battle between the SEC and crypto investment firm Grayscale, the latter has slammed the Commission's previous brief, indicating that the regulator's \"central premise is illogical.\"\n\nToday's reply brief, first shared with Decrypt, responds to the SEC's December 9 brief and is part of ongoing litigation that Grayscale initiated in June 2022. The litigation began after the SEC denied the firm's attempts to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a coveted spot market Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe watchdog argued that the ETF application did not do enough to protect investors from \"fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,\" an argument that has appeared in nearly all of the SEC's Bitcoin ETF rejections.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, the Commission has already approved several futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting that this product does not fall prey to the same fraud and manipulation because \"the two products are not the same.\n\n\"Its central premise\u2014that the Exchange\u2019s surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME provides adequate protection against fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin futures market but not the spot bitcoin market\u2014is illogical,\" argued Grayscale in today's response brief.\n\nA surveillance-sharing agreement refers to an arrangement between an exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in which the CME oversees any instances of market manipulation that would artificially affect the price of an asset.\n\nGrayscale's response countered that any fraud occurring in the spot Bitcoin market \"would necessarily affect the price of Bitcoin futures.\"\n\n\"There is thus no reasonable basis for concluding that CME surveillance adequately protects holders of one kind of ETP [Exchange-Traded Product] but not the other,\" the response continues. \"Yet the Order rests on that very conclusion.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC will issue its final brief on the matter on February 3.\n\nGrayscale chases Bitcoin ETF conversion\n\nThough the market has been waiting for a spot Bitcoin ETF for several years, with Grayscale's litigation also earning the support of many in the industry, the asset manager's ailing GBTC product has piled on the pressure to secure approval for its conversion.\n\nGBTC lets investors gain exposure to Bitcoin without the need for to hold the asset itself. Of late, though, the Grayscale product is trading at a hefty discount to the underlying BTC it hopes to represent. According to Ycharts, the discount is currently 39.68% but has hit a low of 48.89%.\n\nThis discount has emerged due to recent market volatility as well as the inability to redeem the GBTC shares for actual Bitcoin. If the product was converted to a traditional ETF, this redemption process would be available and would likely erase the discount as arbitragers traded away the difference.\n\nThe firm is also facing pressure from investors for this discount. In December, hedge fund Fir Tree Capital filed a lawsuit against Grayscale over \"potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest\" relating to the widening gap between GBTC and Bitcoin.\n\nAnd while Grayscale takes on the SEC, its CEO Michael Sonnenshein has also floated a few ideas about how to address the discount should the Commission win the case. One such idea involves making a tender offer of 20% of the outstanding shares.\n\nThis too, though, would also need approval from the SEC to lift \"certain requirements\" pertaining to the execution of such an offer."

        "content": "BTC price prediction: Key highlights\n\n1. Primary support and resistance levels\n\nOur analysis of the weekly time frame revealed $40,000 to be the lowest probable support for BTC in 2024.\n\nto be the lowest probable support for BTC in 2024. As the king coin ascends, it might face its highest resistance around $69,000 to $70,000.\n\n2. Market sentiment\n\nIn March 2024, Bitcoin was overbought amid a highly bullish market.\n\n3. Predictive forecasts\n\nOur AI/ML predictive models forecast that Bitcoin will be traded at an average price of over $86,000 in 2025 and over $310,000 in 2035\n\nGiven below is a comprehensive weekly technical analysis of BTC, followed by coming days of the month, upcoming months, and yearly forecast tables derived from our AI/ML-based predictive models:\n\nBTC technical analysis: Record highs on the horizon\n\nIn 2023, BTC demonstrated a remarkable recovery from its lows in 2022, showcasing a year of significant volatility and growth. This year, the king coin is experiencing a massive bull run. Many analysts anticipate the Bitcoin price prediction for 2024 will be monumental as the price can achieve record-breaking levels.\n\nThe period under review started with a notable price surge in mid-March that allowed the cryptocurrency to surpass the resistance level at $25,000, subsequently claiming it as new support.\n\n\n\nThis upward momentum continued, with the price reaching the resistance at $30,000 in April. However, this led to a slight rejection, and the price retracted to its support. This pattern repeated in mid-June when the coin's retest of the resistance led to subsequent declines. By mid-July, the price started to drop, eventually falling back to $25,000 by mid-August.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until the end of October that BTC finally broke through this resistance. Continuing this rally, the price successfully claimed $40,000 as support by December. After this, the price consolidated between this support and the resistance at $45,000.\n\nIn February, BTC experienced a significant bullish breakout that saw the cryptocurrency surge through the $45,000 barrier for the first time since April 2022. As the month progressed, bullish momentum intensified, with the $52,000 resistance level vigorously tested by bulls.\n\nBy the end of February, this resistance was successfully converted into a support level, highlighting the strength of the rally. Concurrently, Bitcoin's market capitalization reclaimed the $1 trillion mark.\n\n\n\nThe uptrend carried into March, and Bitcoin hit $69,000 on March 5, surpassing its previous all-time high (ATH) on platforms like Bitstamp and Coinbase. However, a retracement occurred, with prices dropping as low as $61,000 by afternoon, as reported by CoinMarketCap. Despite this pullback, BTC managed to recover some ground, closing at $67,130 at the time of writing, marking an approximate increase of 1% over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe retracement marked a 15% decrease from peak to trough this week. This was the second significant drawdown since the exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch, with the earlier drawdown being 20%. While notable, this post-ETF decline was considered a necessary adjustment for Bitcoin's price to accelerate its growth.\n\nIn light of historical trends that forecast drawdowns exceeding 30% in previous cycles, the recent attainment of an ATH prior to the halving contradicts established norms. Moreover, with the Bitcoin supply anticipated to halve in under 50 days, there's a noticeable shift in the market dynamics.\n\n\n\nThe sentiment within the cryptocurrency industry is increasingly bullish, as a number of experts have begun to forecast significantly higher valuations for Bitcoin in the near future. These predictions suggest that Bitcoin could escalate to monumental price points of $100,000 to $150,000. This optimistic outlook hinges on Bitcoin's ability to push past a critical threshold of $69,000 to $70,000.\n\nDespite these bullish forecasts, the potential for a continued downtrend is scrutinized amidst concerns of an overvalued market. A correction or consolidation could see Bitcoin's value dropping to between $40,000 and $50,000. Such a scenario would likely be temporary, paving the way for Bitcoin to rebound and attain new heights.\n\nMarket dynamics are further complicated by the liquidation thresholds for long and short positions. Approximately $2.2 billion worth of long positions are at risk of liquidation if prices fall to $63,200. At the same time, $2.4 billion in short positions could be liquidated if the price rises to $70,000. These thresholds could either amplify selling pressure or trigger a short squeeze, potentially leading to significant price volatility.\n\nBased on the future predictions from our predictive models, BTC is forecasted to experience a significant increase in value. In the upcoming year, it is anticipated that the coin will trade at an average price exceeding $86,000. Looking ahead, the projections become even more striking.\n\n\n\nBy the year 2035, our models predict that the average price of Bitcoin will exceed $310,000. This long-term forecast highlights the expected continued growth and adoption of Bitcoin as a major digital asset in the financial landscape.\n\nBTC's 2024 roadmap: Key indicators to watch and trade"

        "content": "As cryptocurrency mining becomes an increasingly popular method of obtaining digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), one national park in eastern Congo has decided to put its natural resources to use in order to mine the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) token.\n\nSpecifically, the leadership of Virunga National Park, which was stricken by countless misfortunes over the years, leaving it in desperate need of funding to protect its forests and wildlife, has recognized Bitcoin mining as an ideal opportunity, as MIT Technology Review\u2019s Adam Popescu reported on January 13.\n\nSolution materializes\n\nAccording to the report, Africa\u2019s oldest protected park and home to endangered mountain gorillas was affected by years of militia violence and pillaging, deforestation, pandemic lockdowns, diseases, and meager government assistance, but the plan has been set in motion to use its hydroelectric power for mining Bitcoin in a bid to recover and thrive.\n\nAs the park\u2019s director, Emmanuel de Merode, explained:\n\n\u201cWe built the power plant and figured we\u2019d build the network gradually. (\u2026) Then, we had to shut down tourism in 2018 because of kidnappings [by rebels]. Then, in 2019, we had to shut down tourism because of Ebola. And 2020\u2014the rest is history with covid. For four years, all of our tourism revenue\u2014it used to be 40% of park revenue\u2014it collapsed. (\u2026) It\u2019s not something we expected, but we had to work out a solution.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, De Merode and his colleagues landed on the idea of buying $200,000 in Bitcoin rigs which would be powered by the park\u2019s hydro-energy, providing the necessary profits, as well as a viable way to use this energy.\n\nWith the help of the crypto investor S\u00e9bastien Gouspillou, the park bought second-hand servers in early 2020 and got to building the world\u2019s first known Bitcoin mine operated by a national park and running on clean energy.\n\nThe mine uses the power provided by the Luviro hydro-station, which is one of the park\u2019s river-run hydro plants opened since 2013 (with a fourth one under construction), providing electricity for the Bitcoin mining operation with a low environmental impact \u2013 using the river\u2019s constant flow rather than obstructing it with dams and reservoirs.\n\nWill it work?\n\nDespite the occasional negative developments in the crypto sector, such as the FTX collapse, that have affected the price of Bitcoin, De Merode is optimistic, pointing out that each day of mining represents pure profit, no matter how much Bitcoin fluctuates in value.\n\nAccording to Michael Saylor, the co-founder of the investment firm MicroStrategy, Virunga\u2019s model is \u201cthe ideal high-tech industry to put in a nation that has plenty of clean energy but isn\u2019t able to export a product or produce a service with that energy.\u201d\n\nPeter Wall, the CEO of Argo Blockchain, which runs hydro-powered mines in Quebec, believes that the Virunga mine could, indeed, be profitable as it has all three things that are ultimately necessary to mine Bitcoin: \u201cpower, machines, capital.\u201d\n\nFinally, De Merode has said that this was \u201can incredibly good investment for the park,\u201d as \u201cwe\u2019re not speculating on its value; we\u2019re generating it,\u201d adding that the park was \u201cmaking Bitcoin out of surplus energy and monetizing something that otherwise has no value.\u201d"

        "content": "On January 12, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto sent renowned cryptographer Hal Finney the first Bitcoin transaction.\n\nIt consisted of 10 bitcoins and is forever recorded on the blockchain. Apart from Satoshi, Finney was the first to run the Bitcoin software and tweeted about it the day before he received the first coins.\n\nRunning bitcoin \u2014 halfin (@halfin) January 11, 2009\n\nFinney contributed to Bitcoin, but he was not Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Hal Finney contributed massively to the development of Bitcoin in the early days. In his own words, he carried on a lengthy email correspondence with Satoshi, working out bugs and fixing them as he went.\n\n\u201cI mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test \u2014 I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.\u201d\n\nDr. Craig Wright, now legally recognized as Bitcoin\u2019s inventor, has credited Finney for his help, stating that there were many bugs in the code that he helped fix.\n\nHowever, despite popular opinion, Finney was not Bitcoin\u2019s inventor. When you think about it, it makes little sense for him to have emailed himself, talking about bugs and fixing them, in Bitcoin\u2019s early days.\n\nWhile Finney is a fan favorite, and many people still believe he is the man behind the Satoshi pseudonym, that\u2019s just not true. The man behind the mask was Australian polymath Dr. Craig Wright.\n\nIs Hal Finney the man behind bitcoin? No. No, he isn't, but he was a VERY cool dude, and it was a lot of fun re-reading all of his posts and his emails again over the last month or so while writing. Please read and SHARE. https://t.co/e7Pkg3dBtc#runningbitcoin #bitcoin \u2014 Kurt Wuckert Jr \ud83d\udfe1 GorillaPool.com (@kurtwuckertjr) January 10, 2023\n\nNonetheless, Finney deserves credit for his contributions to Bitcoin. The developer of the PGP encryption system played a pivotal role in making Bitcoin work and will forever be remembered as the first person to receive a transaction.\n\nThe original Bitcoin has been restored\n\nWhen Finney received the 10 bitcoins from Satoshi, Bitcoin was in its original state. Despite a few bugs, it was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that functioned with almost zero fees.\n\nThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime. \u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nSince those days, BTC Core developers and other vested interests, such as Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group, have attempted to hijack and suppress Bitcoin, keeping its scalability and data management potential under wraps.\n\nHowever, 14 years on, the original Bitcoin has been restored; the low-fee, infinitely scalable electronic cash system outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto is back. These days, it\u2019s known by its ticker symbol BSV, and Satoshi Nakamoto, now known by his real name Dr. Craig Wright\u2014is working relentlessly with his team at nChain to make it scale to millions and eventually billions of transactions per second.\n\nThis time, Bitcoin won\u2019t be used for criminal purposes as it was the first time around. Using the legal system, a process is being developed to recover stolen digital assets, and with Bitcoin\u2019s innate traceability, the world will soon understand that it\u2019s the worst possible thing to use for crime.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is growing\n\nJanuary 12, 2009, will forever be remembered as the day the first Bitcoin transaction occurred. However, a few years from now, on the same date, it\u2019s likely that billions of such transactions will occur. These are being powered by an ever-growing number of apps utilizing Bitcoin micropayments.\n\nThe original Bitcoin is back, and despite the best efforts of its enemies, it can not and will not be stopped this time!\n\nWatch: Digital Asset Recovery on Bitcoin\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

The New York attorney-general\u2019s office also sued Nexo for \u201cfalsely representing that it complies with applicable regulations and licensing requirements\u201d.\n\nBy December, Nexo said it would begin phasing out its products and services in the US because the country refused to \u201cprovide a path forward for enabling blockchain businesses\u201d. The company added at the time that it exited New York as part of a \u201cco-operative approach with regulators\u201d.\n\n\n\nBulgaria\u2019s accusations also come in the wake of a tumultuous time for the crypto-lending industry. High-profile lending platforms such as Celsius and BlockFi collapsed into bankruptcy after prices of tokens such as bitcoin and luna crashed, leaving Nexo as one of the few remaining actors in the market. Sofia prosecutors said more than $94bn had passed through Nexo over the past five years.\n\n\n\nBulgarian authorities said the main organisers of the scheme being investigated were Bulgarian citizens and the suspected activity had been carried out mainly in Bulgarian territory.\n\n\u201cEvidence has been gathered that a person who used the platform and transferred cryptocurrencies has been officially declared a person who finances terrorist acts,\u201d the prosecutor added.\n\nNexo said authorities were making anti-money laundering and tax-related inquiries about a Bulgarian entity of the group \u201cthat is not customer facing but only has back-office functions \u2014 payrolls, customer support and compliance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are authorities at one of Nexo\u2019s offices in Bulgaria, which, as you know, is the most corrupt country in the EU\u201d, it said. Nexo was \u201cone of the most stringent entities with regards to know-your-customer and anti-money laundering,\u201d it said.\n\nA spokesperson for the platform added that Nexo was \u201cco-operating fully\u201d with Bulgarian authorities."

        "title": "ChatGPT Answers Crypto\u2019s Biggest Questions: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The internet has become quickly fascinated by ChatGPT \u2013 the language model chatbot that seems to effortlessly provide long-form answers to any question.\n\nCrypto Twitter seems especially fascinated with the AI bot \u2013 from Casa founder Jameson Lopp to Twitter\u2019s new chief and Dogecoin enthusiast, Elon Musk.\n\nWe decided to ask ChatGPT a number of questions related to Bitcoin and crypto adoption \u2013 including those that are still hotly debated by humans. Here\u2019s what the infamous bot had to say.\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum?\n\nWe first asked what ChatGPT thought about Bitcoin: \u201cDoes Bitcoin have intrinsic value?\u201d\n\nMany of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest critics, such as gold bug Peter Schiff, would say no, arguing that the asset is purely speculative and destined to crash to zero. Yet the AI bot\u2019s answer was a bit more nuanced:\n\n\u201cSome people might argue that Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and its ability to function as a digital store of value could be considered as intrinsic value,\u201d it stated.\n\nIts answer captures the view shared by some of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest proponents that the asset can become the \u201cdigital gold\u201d of the 21st century, thanks to its unmanipulable monetary policy.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what ChatGPT pointed out afterward when asked to compare Bitcoin to Ethereum. \u201cIt\u2019s often referred to as digital gold,\u201d it stated. \u201cIts primary use case is as a digital alternative to traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or the Euro.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, it described Ether as having \u201cmore potential for innovation than Bitcoin,\u201d thus making it more attractive to developers. As explained by BitMEX in July, Ethereum\u2019s scripting language and culture have historically been more welcoming to change than Bitcoin\u2019s \u2013 though more dapps are starting to develop on the Bitcoin lightning network.\n\nWho is Satoshi?\n\nChatGPT isn\u2019t all-knowing, however: it admitted that the identity of Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator \u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 \u201chas not been revealed and is not publicly known.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile some individuals have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto or have been suspected of being the creator, none of these claims have been independently verified,\u201d it said. Bitcoin SV founder Craig Wright has often accused others of defaming him when he claims to be the enigmatic founder \u2013 but he\u2019s yet to see much recent success in court.\n\nWhen asked if Bitcoin would ever become the world reserve currency, the bot didn\u2019t rule out the possibility. While it still lacks the \u201cinfrastructure, regulations, and stability,\u201d to be considered as such, it is still \u201cpossible that the future may bring changes to this situation\u201d as the technology grows and develops.\n\nFinally, ChatGPT is not a total nocoiner.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency and blockchain technology are not a scam,\u201d it said when asked \u201cIs crypto a scam?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut like any other financial market, there are risks and frauds to be aware of,\u201d it clarified."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nNorthern Data AG, a German firm focused on Bitcoin mining and cloud computing, has announced the financial results of its mining operations. They mined 2,798 Bitcoins in the 2022 fiscal year, which is a 315 percent increase from the previous year.\n\n\n\nNorthern Data generated 77.7 million euros in revenue from BTC mining in 2022. Additionally, the company sold 3,005 Bitcoins for a mean price of 23,849 euros, resulting in a cash revenue of 71.7 million euros.\n\nNorthern Data also shared in their data release that they had 3.6 exahash per second of computing power allocated to Bitcoin mining. They also projected that their consolidated revenues would be between 190 million to 194 million euros, and their EBITDA adjusted for losses from crypto trading would be between 40 million to 50 million euros.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, December was a difficult month for Northern Data. They mined 177 Bitcoins, which is a 15 percent decrease from November and a 25 percent decrease from December of the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decline was caused by high energy prices, which led to some of the ASIC machines being out of service at certain times, unable to produce continuously. The company stated that it is moving its ASIC machines to locations with more favourable energy prices to improve production stability and optimise capacity utilisation in order to reach its goal of mining 350 Bitcoins per month.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, some Bitcoin mining firms have encountered difficulties due to the rising difficulty of mining and the cost of electricity. This has resulted in a reduction in mining profitability and led some miners to close their operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, some companies have reported substantial increases in revenue and mining power, thanks to improved mining equipment and optimisation of mining software.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings, one of the biggest BTC mining operations in North America, has been testing the process of overclocking to gain a competitive edge in the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the update released by the company, it mined 475 Bitcoins in December, bringing the total mined for the 2022 fiscal year to 4,144 Bitcoins, which is a 30 percent increase from the 3,197 Bitcoins mined in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

        "title": "Here's how to quickly spot a deepfake crypto scam \u2014 cybersecurity execs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto investors have been urged to keep their eyes peeled for \u201cdeepfake\u201d crypto scams to come, with the digital-doppelganger technology continuing to advance, making it harder for viewers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nDavid Schwed, the chief operating officer of blockchain security firm Halborn, told Cointelegraph that the crypto industry is more \u201csusceptible\u201d to deepfakes than ever because \u201ctime is of the essence in making decisions,\u201d which results in less time to verify the veracity of a video.\n\nDeepfakes use deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) to create highly realistic digital content by manipulating and altering original media, such as swapping faces in videos, photos, and audio, according to OpenZeppelin technical writer Vlad Estoup.\n\nEstoup noted that crypto scammers often use deepfake technology to creat fake videos of well-known personalities to execute scams.\n\nAn example of such a scam was a deepfake video of FTX\u2019s former CEO in November, where scammers used old interview footage of Sam Bankman-Fried and a voice emulator to direct users to a malicious website promising to \u201cdouble your cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, a verified account posing as FTX founder SBF posted dozens of copies of this deepfake video offering FTX users \"compensation for the loss\" in a phishing scam designed to drain their crypto wallets pic.twitter.com/3KoAPRJsya \u2014 Jason Koebler (@jason_koebler) November 21, 2022\n\nSchwed said that the volatile nature of crypto causes people to panic and take a \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d approach, which can lead to them getting suckered into deepfake scams. He noted:\n\n\u201cIf a video of CZ is released claiming withdrawals will be halted within the hour, are you going to immediately withdraw your funds, or spend hours trying to figure out if the message is real?\u201d\n\nHowever, Estoup believes that while deepfake technology is advancing at a rapid rate, it\u2019s not yet \u201cindistinguishable from reality.\u201d\n\nHow to spot a deepfake: Watch the eyes\n\nSchwed suggests one useful way to quickly spot a deepfake is to watch when the subject blinks their eyes. If it looks unnatural, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a deepfake.\n\nThis is due to the fact that deepfakes are generated using image files sourced on the internet, where the subject will usually have their eyes open, explains Schwed. Thus, in a deepfake, the blinking of the subject\u2019s eyes needs to be simulated.\n\nHey @elonmusk & @TuckerCarlson have you seen, what I assume is #deepfake paid ad featuring both of you? @YouTube how is this allowed? This is getting out of hand, its not #FreeSpeech it\u2019s straight #fraud: Musk Reveals Why He Financial Supports To Canadians https://t.co/IgoTbbl4fL pic.twitter.com/PRMfiyG3Pe \u2014 Matt Dupuis (@MatthewDupuis) January 4, 2023\n\nSchwed said the best identifier of course is to ask questions that only the real individual can answer, such as \u201cwhat restaurant did we meet at for lunch last week?\u201d\n\nEstoup said there is also AI software available that can detect deepfakes and suggests one should look out for big technological improvements in this area.\n\nHe also gave some age-old advice: \u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Yikes!\u2019 Elon Musk warns users against latest deepfake crypto scam\n\nLast year, Binance\u2019s chief communications officer, Patrick Hillman, revealed in an August blog post that a sophisticated scam was perpetrated using a deepfake of him.\n\nHillman noted that the team used previous news interviews and TV appearances over the years to create the deepfake and \u201cfool several highly intelligent crypto members.\u201d\n\nHe only became aware of this when he started to receive online messages thanking him for his time talking to project teams about potentially listing their assets on Binance.com.\n\nEarlier this week, blockchain security firm SlowMist noted there were 303 blockchain security incidents in 2022, with 31.6% of them caused by phishing, rug pulls and other scams."

The issuance of these bonds was initially planned for March 2022. However, it had to be postponed several times owing to the onset of the brutal crypto winter since last year.\n\nIt must be noted that these bonds would be denominated in US dollars, have a 10-year maturity date, and carry a 6.5 percent annual interest rate, as per their initial proposal.\n\nWhat would Bitcoin City offer?\n\nAs per Bitfinex, a renowned crypto exchange and the technology provider for the Volcano bonds, issuance of Bitcoin-backed bonds would allow El Salvador to raise capital to pay for its sovereign debt, fund the building of the Bitcoin City as well as help in the creation of the Bitcoin mining infrastructure.\n\nThe exchange further claims that the proposed Bitcoin City would be a special economic zone similar to those seen in China. They would offer tax advantages, and crypto-friendly regulations, as well as incentivise Bitcoin businesses for its residents.\n\nPublished By: Jasmine anand Published On: Jan 12, 2023 --- ENDS ---"

        "content": "Crypto adoption in India is being driven primarily by the GenZ and millennial population. An overwhelming majority of crypto investors in the country fall in the 18-25 (45 per cent) and 26-35 (34 per cent) age groups, found a 2022 analysis by homegrown crypto exchange CoinSwitch.\n\nCrypto, truly, is a young person\u2019s asset class, with just 8 per cent of retail investors above 45 years of age.\n\nIn 2022, which brought about a bloodbath for the global crypto industry, Indian investors shied away from panic selling, and instead, held on to their investments. New investors too started building their crypto portfolio in the bear market to complement their equity investments.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most valuable crypto, continues to be the most popular token in India, with 12.12 per cent of investments going towards it. This is followed by investments in DOGE (11.54 per cent), Ethereum (9.43 per cent), Shiba Inu (6.92 per cent), and Polygon (4.3 per cent). Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are meme coins, which are inspired by internet memes, and are more volatile than the rest.\n\n\u201cIndia set aside 40 per cent of its crypto investments on top dollar CRE8 coins and DeFi utility tokens in 2022, and only about 6 per cent in metaverse tokens. In fact, a greater share of investments (~8 per cent) was made on Ethereum alternatives (Layer1 networks that rival the blue-chip smart-contract chain) than metaverse tokens,\u201d CoinSwitch revealed in its report.\n\nDelhi ranked on top in terms of crypto investments (by value) in the country. This was followed by the IT hubs of Bangalore and Hyderabad. \u201cJaipur has the highest crypto adoption among tier-2 and tier-3 cities, followed by Lucknow and Pune,\u201d CoinSwitch stated.\n\nCrypto, meanwhile, continues to be a male-dominated sector, with only 8 per cent of CoinSwitch\u2019s 19 million users being women in 2022. A prior analysis by global crypto exchange KuCoin had pegged India\u2019s overall crypto population at 115 million, with 52 per cent of them investing in the asset class to generate a passive income.\n\nAlso Read: Budget 2023: CoinSwitch expects govt to incentivise crypto users and 'reduce the burden of taxes'"

        "title": "Bitcoin price crashes by 65%, adoption rate drops - Punch Newspapers",
        "content": "The global price of Bitcoin, the most successful cryptocurrency, fell by 65.29 per cent in 2022.\n\nThis came as the adoption of digital currencies fell in a year rocked by crypto scandals, with the fall of FTX dominating the airwaves. According to data from coinmarketcap.com, the price of BTC fell from $47,686.81 as of January 01, 2022, to $16,547.50 as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThis is as the market capitalisation of BTC fell by 64.69 per cent from $902.10bn at the beginning of 2022 to $318.52bn at the end of 2022. After reaching record highs during the pandemic, with many analysts suggesting it would reach $100,000, the price of BTC took a beating in 2022.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, a blockchain insight firm, the global adoption of BTC and other cryptocurrencies has leveled off after growing consistently since mid-2019. It stated that the global adoption of crypto reached its present all-time high in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite this fall, emerging markets like Nigeria continue to dominate crypto adoption. In its \u2018The 2022 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,\u2019 Chainalysis explained, \u201cOne trend we noted last year has only gotten stronger this year: Emerging markets dominate the index.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cTen are lower middle income: Vietnam, Philippines, Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Morocco, Nepal, Kenya, and Indonesia. Eight are upper-middle income: Brazil, Thailand, Russia, China, Turkey, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador. Two are high income: United States and United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm, the reason for this dominance is that users of crypto in countries like Nigeria use cryptocurrency to send remittances, preserve their savings in times of fiat currency volatility, and fulfill other financial needs unique to their economies.\n\nDespite this fall in market value, BTC investment by Nigerians grew by five per cent in 2022 according to a The PUNCH report. Paxful, one of the major peer-to-peer crypto firms, said, \u201cNigeria is our largest country based on trade volume.\n\n\u201cTrading volume in the country grew by over 5 per cent y-o-y from January through September (looking at 2022/2021 data).\u201d\n\nData from the firm also confirmed that BTC trade from the nation had reached about N171.50bn ($400m) from January to June 2022.\n\nNigerians\u2019 investment in Bitcoin grew by over five per cent in 2022. In an earlier report, The PUNCH had reported that BTC traders were lamenting their losses because of the downturn in the price of BTC.\n\nOne trader, who asked not to be named, said, \u201cI have been in crypto for a while. In the past few weeks, let\u2019s say about eight weeks if anyone tells you they\u2019ve not lost money they are lying.\n\n\u201cLoses is part of this. On a personal level, and with my firm, we\u2019ve lost about N40m, this is to be conservative. We are big traders. I won\u2019t call it a loss though, because as long as you are still in the market, you will still get your money back. But on a temporary level, if we close our position now, we would be forfeiting nothing less than that amount.\u201d\n\nWhile the price of BTC has rebounded to $17,348.36 as of 5:15pm Nigerian time on Wednesday, a sense of impending doom remains.\n\nA financial expert, Kalu Aja, on Twitter recently (Tuesday, 10, 2022) asked crypto users to withdraw their assets. He tweeted, \u201cIf you have any crypto assets staked, it will be prudent to withdraw. Yes withdraw.\u201d"

Now, Ethereum, in addition to the capabilities that Bitcoin already has, supports a smart contracts feature which enables developers to write applications on top of it just like a Google Play Store. It reached $1 in 2016 and rocketed to $1,440 in another two years. Though it retracted back to $80 during the 2018 bear market, it catapulted itself to new all-time high of $4,868 in November 2021. In terms of price per coin, Bitcoin is far ahead and while Ethereum is still being correlated to Bitcoin\u2019s price actions. However, Ethereum dominance (as a share of crypto market capitalization) is growing steadily and is currently a strong #2 at 18.3% compared to 42.5% dominance of Bitcoin."

After triggering the bullish flag, the Bollinger bands are expanding with the upper Bollinger band present at $18,523, while the lower Bollinger band is at $17,091. It suggests that the price will stay bullish in the near future. The relative strength index is at the level of 71.90, indicating that BTC/USD will not reach a future high in the near future and drop since it is in the overbought zone.\n\nThe hourly price chart reveals that bulls have been seizing the lead in the market, which has significantly weakened the bears\u2019 position from earlier hours and increased the bullish momentum. Given the price\u2019s sharp rise, the momentum has been comparatively stronger. However, for Bitcoin to move higher, it still needs to cross its recent flimsy high.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin will continue to go sideways for a while since it recently faced a big spike, making buyers and sellers struggle to take control of the market. Moreover, investors need to wait for the CPI data which will be released today since it always has a big impact on the crypto market.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
