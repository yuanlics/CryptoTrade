        "content": "Bitcoin could soar above $120,000 if miners keep holding onto tokens, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick said.\n\nIn an interview with Insider, he acknowledged bitcoin's price gains help fuel a positive-feedback loop.\n\n\"And so your point about this becoming self-fulfilling, I suspect is actually a very important driver.\"\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

But as the price rises and previous debt struggles in the industry ebb away, miners are letting go of less bitcoin.\n\nAnother tailwind is the coin's upcoming halving in 2024, which is when the reward given to miners is cut in half. This is to cap the supply of bitcoins, and has historically led to price increases.\n\n\"Then if you add in some of the other things, like getting close to the halving cycle, et cetera, then that sort of adds,\" Kendrick said. \"And then yeah, the cycle in theory just keeps going.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiners also have little reason outside of bitcoin's price moves to sell the token, he said. Some of this is on account of the culture surrounding the industry, with many miners holding on in the anticipation that bitcoin eventually reaches stellar highs.\n\n\"So they basically want to have a company that starts out when prices are cheap, get cheaper electricity and stuff, and then hold on. It's like a super-leveraged play,\" he said.\n\nKendrick has been bullish on bitcoin this year, and in April he said it would hit $100,000 in 2024, citing a number of other factors beyond miner profitability. Examples included bitcoin's safe-haven reputation, regulatory adaptations, institutional interest, alternative currency fall-off, and less volatility.\n\nNow, he told Insider that a few of these factors also suggest more upside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, BlackRock's interest in creating a bitcoin spot ETF signals growing demand from the investment firm's clients, while the Federal Reserve's expected end on its rate-hiking cycle would marginally help bitcoin.\n\nThe one factor that Kendrick would reassess was his idea that bitcoin would gain from disinvestment in other crypto, or so-called altcoins.\n\nFor this, he noted the recent courtroom victory of Ripple over the Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the firm in 2020 over its cryptocurrency XRP.\n\nHowever, a judge recently ruled in favor of Ripple, saying XRP is not a security, meaning it's outside the SEC's regulatory reach. The news sparked a rally in altcoins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"So the assumption is, well, if Ripple is not [a security], then these are also not,\" he said. \"So that's why you had big bounces in like Solana, as an example.\"\n\nHow long this tailwind for altcoins will last is uncertain, Kendrick said, adding that any institutional success in establishing bitcoin ETFs would prompt a renewed focus on apex tokens."

        "title": "Bitcoin's dull price action ignites buying interest in LINK, FIL, SNX and THETA - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to rise above the overhead resistance at $31,000, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dive below the $29,500 support. This suggests that a catalyst may be needed for the price to break out from its range.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting son July 25 and 26 are important events to keep an eye on. The FedWatch Tool shows a 99.2% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike in the meeting. If that happens, the markets may not witness a knee-jerk reaction as the hike seems to have been priced in. However, any surprise move by the Fed could thrust the price out of the range.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nSeveral analysts expect the range to break soon, but there is no consensus on the direction of the breakout. If the price breaks below the range, analysts expect a significant downside. Some are even projecting a fall closer to $20,000.\n\nIf Bitcoin moves higher, select altcoins could attract buyers. Let\u2019s study the charts of top-five cryptocurrencies that could turn positive over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin remains pinned below the 20-day exponential moving average ($30,036) for the past few days, but a positive sign is that the bears have not been able to sink the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($28,979).\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThis suggests that the bulls have not given up and they are buying on every minor dip. The repeated failure of the bears to pull the BTC/USDT pair lower may attract buyers.\n\nIf the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally toward the overhead resistance of $31,000. A charge above the $31,000-to-$32,400 zone could clear the path for a possible rally to $40,000.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down and dives below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that bears are making a comeback. The pair may then slump toward the support at $24,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages on the four-hour chart are flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen to the midpoint, indicating that the range-bound action may continue for some more time.\n\nIf bulls push the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair could attempt a rally to $30,500 and then to $31,000. The important support to watch on the downside is $29,500. If this level crumbles, the pair may decline to $27,500.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink (LINK) has been trading inside a large range between $5.50 and $9.50 for the past several months. The bears pulled the price below the range on June 10, but they could not build upon this advantage.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls pushed the price back into the range on June 21 and are currently attempting to drive the LINK/USDT pair toward the overhead resistance of $9.50. Both moving averages have turned up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls are in control.\n\nThe bears will try to stall the up-move in the zone between $8.50 and $8.80, but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair may soar to $9.50. The important support to watch on the downside is $7.50 and then the 20-day EMA ($7.05).\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe correction on the four-hour chart has reached the 20-day EMA, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the pair could surge to $8.46. A break above this level will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could then reach $8.80.\n\nThis positive view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA. That could tempt short-term bulls to book profits, pulling the price down to the 50-day SMA and, subsequently, to $6.50.\n\nFilecoin price analysis\n\nFilecoin (FIL) is trying to form an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close above the neckline.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($4.36) has started to turn up gradually and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers thrust the price above the neckline, the FIL/USDT pair could attempt a rally to $6.50 and, eventually, to the pattern target of $7.30.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down sharply from the neckline and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($4.12), it will suggest that the bulls have lost their grip. The pair may then skid to $3.50 and later to $3.29.\n\nFIL/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is sloping up on the four-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance at $4.74, but if this level is crossed, the pair could retest the neckline.\n\nThe bears are expected to defend this level aggressively, but if bulls do not allow the price to slip below the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a rally above the neckline increases.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears are selling on rallies. That may drag the pair to $4.14.\n\nRelated: Ripple effect? Stellar (XLM) is catching up to XRP price gains\n\nSynthetix price analysis\n\nSynthetix (SNX) is attempting to break out from a basing pattern, but the bulls are facing solid resistance in the zone between $3.40 and $3.56.\n\nSNX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nDuring the pullback, the bulls did not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($2.56), which is a positive sign. This suggests that dips are being bought. Buyers will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they can pull it off, the SNX/USDT pair may start a rally to the next resistance at $4.50.\n\nThe bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to stall the relief rally in the overhead zone and yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair may tumble to the 50-day SMA ($2.19).\n\nSNX/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears have pulled the price below the 20-day EMA, but the bulls are trying to guard the 50-day SMA. This suggests that lower levels continue to attract buyers.\n\nIf bulls propel the price above $3.15, the momentum could pick up and the pair could retest the resistance at $3.30. This is an important level to watch for because if it gives way, the pair may resume the next leg of the up-move and hit $3.82.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to tug the price below the moving averages. The pair could then collapse to $2.52.\n\nTheta Network price analysis\n\nThe recovery in the Theta Network (THETA) is facing selling near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.83.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, a positive sign in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-day EMA ($0.77). This indicates that the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying on dips.\n\nA break and close above $0.83 could open the doors for a further rise to the 50% retracement level of $0.91 and, thereafter, to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.99.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and plunges below the moving averages. The THETA/USDT pair could then descend to $0.66.\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is trading inside an ascending channel pattern. The bulls are trying to arrest the pullback at the moving averages and resume the up-move. Generally, in a channel, the price bounces off the support and reaches the resistance.\n\nIf the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to propel the pair above $0.85. If they succeed, the pair may climb to the resistance of the channel near $0.90.\n\nContrarily, if the price slips below the 50-day SMA, the bears will try to pull the pair to the support of the channel. A break below this level could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Ether gained 1.73% to US$1,887.\n\nHowever, both tokens have yet to make up losses for the past seven days, with Bitcoin off 0.37% for the week, while Ether is sitting on a weekly loss of 1.73%. Bitcoin fell back later in the morning.\n\nTrading in Bitcoin and Ether will remain rangebound until the Fed decision on rates on July 27, Mark Wong, senior trader at Hong Kong-based digital asset platform Hashkey Group, said in a Friday newsletter. \u201cA rate hike is all but priced in with an implied probability of 99.8% from the futures market,\u201d Wong said.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also traded higher Monday, with Cardano\u2019s ADA token leading the winners with a gain of 3.01% to US$0.3169 and up 0.59% for the week.\n\nInput Output Global, one of the developers behind the Cardano blockchain, last week said Mithril \u2013 a Cardano stake-based signature scheme \u2013 was nearing its mainnet launch to improve the node syncing and security of the Cardano network.\n\nOn the regulatory front, a portion of the court\u2019s recent verdict in the Ripple case was \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday in documents filed in its on-going lawsuit against Singapore-based Terraform Labs, hinting that the SEC would challenge the Ripple ruling.\n\nThe SEC in February charged Singapore-based Terraform Labs Pte and its co-founder Do Hyeong Kwon with orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud involving an algorithmic stablecoin and other crypto asset securities.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.14% in the past 24 hours to US$1.20 trillion, while trading volume rose 13.56% to US$24.5 billion.\n\nForkast 500 flat, OpenSea starts NFT swapping\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

Volumes traded mixed in the top five NFT collections.\n\nOpenSea, the world\u2019s second-largest NFT marketplace by trading volume, launched its \u201cDeals\u201d function on Friday, which allows its NFT holders to directly swap their collections with each other and include wrapped Ether (WETH) in their offers to sweeten up the transactions.\n\nElsewhere, the slump in value of Twitter Co-Founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s first NFT caught the attention of mainstream media including CNBC and the Economic Times on Sunday. The NFT, based on Dorsey\u2019s first Twitter post, sold at over US$2.1 million in 2021, but the highest offer for the NFT is now 1 ETH (US$1,875), according to OpenSea.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is looking rather flat in the Forkast 500 index, (which) reflects that continued downtrend we\u2019ve been watching most of the year,\u201d Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, said on Friday. The Forkast 500 NFT index has dropped over 35% since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of January, the market almost completely slants right,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nUS equities await Fed, earnings\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 12:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures dipping and Nasdaq futures edging higher.

China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all gained, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve meets Wednesday and Thursday this week on interest rates and analysts overwhelmingly expect another 25-basis-point rate hike.

Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde have flagged stubborn inflation as a concern, according to Bloomberg on Saturday.\n\nAlong with the Fed and ECB, Japan\u2019s central bank will also meet this week, but there is little likelihood of any change to its ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nIn the U.S. this week, more than 150 U.S. corporations, including Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, will release second-quarter results.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has once again fallen into familiar territories, trading below the $30,000 mark, with investors closely monitoring its subsequent price trajectory. In the coming weeks, the asset\u2019s valuation could be significantly influenced by upcoming macroeconomic news, such as the Federal Reserve interest rate decision.\n\nIn this line, according to prominent pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst FieryTrading on TradingView, in a post on July 22, investors should expect increased Bitcoin volatility this weekend. However, he remains optimistic about the long-term bullish sentiment for the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nHe noted that despite Bitcoin\u2019s failure to break through the $31,000 position, the long-term bullish trend remains intact.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\n\u201cEvery time that this indicator flashes green (= low volatility), the market will make a big move in the near future. The market switches between two periods: periods of contraction (now) and periods of expansion (volatility),\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision indicates that the market might be awaiting potentially increased volatility, which has also affected traditional financial products.\n\nElsewhere, another analysis posted on July 22 by Tolberti suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s recent price movement point to a possible bullish breakout. According to the analysts, Bitcoin is showing a bullish pennant pattern on the daily chart after a month of consolidation.\n\nHe predicted a potential breakout to around $34,000 based on the 0.618 Fibonacci extension. A pullback may follow, but an uptrend to $39,000 is expected later.\n\nAt the same time, he pointed out that traders should be cautious, as a breakdown could lead to a drop to $21,000, and taking advantage of a possible breakdown with short positions is being considered.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFurthermore, he suggested that the bullish stand on Bitcoin emanated from the fact that several altcoins are showing signs of a possible breakout in the coming days.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent underperformance\n\nIt is worth noting that Bitcoin\u2019s recent underperformance is concerning for some market participants, especially given the presence of significant catalysts. The cryptocurrency market was initially boosted by the news of financial giants like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) filing for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which briefly lifted Bitcoin above $30,000 in June.\n\nAdditionally, the pro-crypto ruling in the Ripple case saw Bitcoin reach its highest value of the year. However, despite these positive developments, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain its high prices.\n\nOne of the contributing factors to this struggle is the ongoing regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies, which continue to exert downward pressure on prices. In general, the crypto market has been relatively quiet, indicating a lack of positive momentum.\n\nWhile long-term holders of Bitcoin may remain confident in the cryptocurrency, their influence alone is not enough to sustain high prices.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is striving to maintain its position above the $29,000 level, avoiding a free fall. As of press time, the asset was trading at $29,897, experiencing a decline of over 1% in the past seven days.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAccording to technical analysis, the one-day gauges retrieved from TradingView indicate neutrality. A summary of the gauges recommends a \u2018neutral\u2019 sentiment score of 9, while the moving averages indicate a \u2018sell\u2019 rating of 6. On the other hand, oscillators also align with the \u2018neutral\u2019 sentiment, registering a score of 8.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nOverall, Bitcoin\u2019s current underlying possible trigger is the upcoming Fed policy.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Coming. Beware the Risk - HT Tech",
        "content": "Last month, BlackRock Inc., the world's biggest money manager, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2014 a fund that would invest in the digital currency directly rather than through futures markets. BlackRock joins tens of other smaller ETF providers with the same request, so far without success. But with BlackRock's heft behind growing demands for a spot Bitcoin fund, it's only a matter of time before the SEC relents.\n\nAnd it should. A spot ETF would allow investors to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin more easily, cheaply and securely than they can today. In a crypto industry awash with scams, regulatory oversight would also give investors and money managers confidence that they're buying a bona fide financial product, particularly if it has BlackRock's name on it.\n\nWhen available, spot Bitcoin ETFs will become a fixture in many portfolios, and deservedly or not, the conversation will be less about whether Bitcoin is a fraud and more about its merit relative to traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. Crypto cheerleader and founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., Mike Novogratz, gave investors a preview of that conversation recently, asserting that Bitcoin has produced a higher Sharpe Ratio \u2014 a popular measure of risk-adjusted return \u2014 than any other investment over the past three years and inviting others to run the numbers for themselves.\n\nSo I did. The first thing that pops out, of course, is Bitcoin's incredible growth, owing mostly to the fact that investors had access early in its life cycle. Unlike stocks, which are offered to the public well after companies' founding and early growth, anyone could have bought Bitcoin from the start, or close to it. Those who did and hung onto their coins pocketed an unheard-of return of 176% a year since July 2010, which is as far back as the record I'm using goes.\n\nAfter accounting for risk, though, Bitcoin doesn't seem so exceptional. The Sharpe Ratio that Novogratz refers to compares an investment's excess return over cash with its volatility, a higher ratio indicating a better risk-return trade-off. While Bitcoin has far outpaced the S&P 500 Index, for example, it has also been 13 times more volatile, as measured by annualized standard deviation, so its Sharpe Ratio isn't much better. Bitcoin has generated a ratio of 0.92 since 2010, barely higher than the S&P 500's ratio of 0.89.\n\nThe Sharpe Ratio recognizes that volatility is just as important as return because the higher the volatility of an investment, the less likely it is that investors will hang around to capture the return. Nowhere is that truer than with Bitcoin. Indeed, Bitcoin's record since inception is largely irrelevant because few people bought it in 2010 and held it ever since; investors have more commonly dipped in and out along the way. Bitcoin's long-term record is no more useful to day-one investors because its pace of growth has slowed over time and will continue to as it matures.\n\nThe better question, then, as Novogratz suggests, is how Bitcoin has performed over shorter rolling periods after accounting for risk. Starting with the most recent three years, Bitcoin produced a Sharpe Ratio of 0.63 through June, well below the S&P 500's ratio of 0.8 and matching the ratio of the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index, a global stock index that includes large and small companies. So, for starters, Bitcoin has not produced the best Sharpe Ratio during the past three years, not now nor when Novogratz said otherwise.\n\nBitcoin's full record is no more impressive. It has a median Sharpe Ratio of 0.94 for all three-year periods, which is less than the S&P 500's and comparable to that of the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. Bitcoin's median Sharpe Ratio is higher than that of the global stock index, although the period since Bitcoin debuted has been unusually disappointing for non-US stocks. Longer term, foreign stocks should produce a Sharpe Ratio comparable to that of US stocks.\n\nThere's also more variability in Bitcoin's results, which means investors have had wildly different outcomes depending on when they invested. Bitcoin's rolling three-year Sharpe Ratios are three times more volatile than those of stocks and nearly twice as volatile as bonds. Its Sharpe Ratio has beaten the S&P 500 only about 40% of the time over rolling three years. It has a better record against bonds and non-US stocks so far but still loses much of the time. So how Bitcoin fares relative to other investments is a gamble all its own.\n\nBitcoin also carries risk that the Sharpe Ratio isn't designed to detect. The ratio is most often used to size up diversified baskets of stocks, bonds and other assets, where the risk is market volatility, not permanent loss. But Bitcoin is a single cryptocurrency, and like any individual stock or bond, it can get wiped out no matter how sturdy it might seem. The same can't be said for broad market indexes, which makes Bitcoin riskier at any Sharpe Ratio.\n\nAs spot Bitcoin ETFs near, there will be more said about Bitcoin's merit relative to other investments. There's no better way to test these claims than to look at the numbers, and when you do, don't be surprised to find that much of what is said just isn't so."

        "title": "Bitcoin Will Reach $175,000 If Prices Break Above This Rising Channel, Trader Claims - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s six-year range inside a rising channel has drawn the attention of a curious but optimistic analyst. Previewing the price chart shows that the coin has been in range over the years, capturing all of its volatility. Despite occasional dumps and pumps, the structure is yet to be broken.\n\nBy the time the screenshot was shared on July 21, Bitcoin was trading in the lower part of the rising channel, skirting the support trend line, an indicator that prices have been generally lower in recent months. The rejection of lower lows and bounce from the support trend line, the analyst says, is bullish and squarely puts back bulls in contention.\n\nBitcoin To $175,000?\n\nAccording to the trader\u2019s assessment, a breakout above the upper resistance level at around $32,000 could potentially trigger a new bull run that may see the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency retest highs of the rising channel at $175,000, a level that upbeat HODLers can mark as a feasible target.\n\nStill, considering the volatility in crypto, this bullish forecast cannot be dismissed. To illustrate, the last bull run drove Bitcoin prices from sub-$10,000 to peaks of $69,000 in less than two years. Therefore, if Bitcoin bulls push above $32,000, a price level that the analyst claim is important, it could be a bullish signal that may be the beginning of another leg up in the resumption of the bullish formation set in motion between 2020 and 2021.\n\nBitcoin is trading below the $30,000 level at spot rates with resistance at $31,800. Despite the general optimism across the board, bulls are yet to breach July 2023 highs as prices consolidate.\n\nHalving And ETF Approval As Tailwinds?\n\nSpecific triggers for the next run are unknown for now. Even so, considering past cycles, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event may provide the impetus for a leg up toward 2021 highs at $69,000. Besides, traders are closely monitoring how the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the United States progresses.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the past. However, the involvement of BlackRock has been received positively, lifting prices in the past few weeks. BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager, managing trillions.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF would ease institutional investors\u2019 involvement in the sphere, potentially driving demand and lifting prices. Most importantly, a Bitcoin ETF legitimizes Bitcoin as an investment asset. Bitcoin is the most dominant crypto asset, and complex derivatives instruments, including exchange-traded products (ETPs), have been approved and listed in various markets across Canada, Europe, and Brazil.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "How the next Bitcoin halving might affect the price and miners? - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Edul Patel\n\nIn the past few years, Bitcoin has experienced several cycles of price fluctuations, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts. Amidst these market movements, a crucial event known as Bitcoin Halving has taken place three times. But what exactly is Bitcoin Halving and what role does it play in the Bitcoin ecosystem?\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\n\n\nBitcoin Halving is a special event that happens about every four years in the Bitcoin system. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in total. Right now, around 19.5 million Bitcoins have been mined so far, of which 4 million has been irreversibly lost. 1.5 million BTC are yet to be mined. During the halving event, the rewards that Bitcoin miners get for their work are cut in half. This event has had an effect on the price of Bitcoin in the past. The next halving is scheduled to take place on 26th April 2024.\n\n\n\nHow does Bitcoin Halving Work?\n\n\n\nIn simple terms, Bitcoin validators are responsible for checking and approving Bitcoin transactions through a process called mining. When they successfully validate a block of transactions, they currently receive a reward of 6.25 BTC (Bitcoins), which is currently worth around $148,000. This acts as a good incentive for miners to continue validating and adding blocks of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\n\nThese blocks of transactions are added approximately every 10 minutes, and the Bitcoin system has a rule that reduces the mining reward by half after every 210,000 blocks are created. This reduction happens roughly every four years and is often accompanied by increased price changes and unpredictability in the value of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nAfter the fourth halving event, which is scheduled to happen next year, the mining rewards will decrease to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\n\n\nHistory of Bitcoin Halving and Price\n\n\n\nLooking back at the past, we can see that during previous halving events, the price of Bitcoin increases in anticipation and then after the event it stabilizes. In 2012, the price was $9 on October 26th and rose to $12.35 on the day of the halving on 28th Nov 2012.\n\nSimilarly, in 2016 the price of Bitcoin was $568 on June 28th and on the date of halving on July 9th, the price was $650.53. In 2020, on April 11th the bitcoin price was about $5884 and on the date of halving on 2020 11th May, the price was $8553. These historical patterns show that Bitcoin Halving has often led to a substantial increase in price before and in the following months. This demonstrates the potential impact that the halving event can have on the value of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWhy is Bitcoin Halving Important?\n\n\n\nThe reason for reducing the mining reward through Bitcoin Halving is to manage the creation of new Bitcoins and maintain their limited availability in the long run. By lowering the reward, Bitcoin Halving helps control inflation and ensures that the production of new Bitcoins happens at a slower pace. This event has important effects on the supply and potential value of Bitcoin, as well as on the miners who play a vital role in securing the network using their computers. Understanding Bitcoin Halving is crucial for grasping how the Bitcoin market works and the factors that impact its value over time.\n\nHow can Bitcoin Halving Impact the Miners?\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving event will reduce the mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block next year. This reduction in rewards may make mining less profitable for miners. Consequently, unless there is a significant increase in the price of Bitcoin, miners are likely to pause their investments in new mining hardware for the next few months. In some cases, miners may even shut down less efficient mining hardware because it fails to generate sufficient bitcoins to cover operational expenses.\n\n\n\nIn the short term, the decrease in mining resources is expected to result in a slower rate of Bitcoin creation. However, the Bitcoin network has an automatic mechanism to maintain a relatively constant rate of new bitcoin production. Every two weeks, the network adjusts the difficulty of the mining problem to ensure an average rate of approximately six blocks per hour. If blocks are being produced too slowly, the network lowers the difficulty level to widen the range of winning hash values. Conversely, if blocks are being created too quickly, the network increases the difficulty to make the mining problem more challenging and slow down block creation.\n\n\n\nMiners strive to make profits, and competition among miners helps maintain relatively stable profit margins over time. Therefore, if revenues from Bitcoin mining decrease by half, miners will likely spend approximately half the amount to produce those bitcoins. Since electricity is a major cost in Bitcoin mining, the reduction in block rewards should ultimately lead to a similar reduction in the electricity consumed by mining.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the halving event indirectly affects mining difficulty. As block rewards decrease, miners may find mining less profitable and decide to stop or reduce their mining activities. This reduction in overall computing power dedicated to mining prompts the network to adjust the difficulty level downwards. The aim is to make it easier to find the solution and maintain the desired rate of block creation.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s important to note that the impact of the halving event on mining profitability can be offset by higher prices of Bitcoin. When the price of Bitcoin increases, the revenues earned from each block also rise. This, in turn, increases the amount of money miners are willing to invest in mining hardware and the electricity they consume during the process. Therefore, if the price of Bitcoin rises significantly, miners are incentivized to purchase more mining equipment and expand their operations, leading to an increase in electricity usage.\n\nThe author is co-founder and CEO, Mudrex\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nLast week\u2019s blistering altcoin rally tapered off this week as Chainlink, XRP, XLM, Stellar and TRX were the only coins to post any notable gains over the last seven days.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) entered the weekend slightly lower than they did this time last week.\n\nBitcoin dropped 1.5% to its current price of $29,869, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the world\u2019s second favorite coin, ETH, dropped 2.5% to trade at $1,888 at the time of writing.\n\nThe steepest pullbacks among leading currencies this week were from Solana (SOL), which dropped 9.8% to $25.68, and Avalanche (AVAX), which shed 8.1% to $13.77.\n\nSeveral altcoins appreciated; notably, Toncoin (TON) grew 8.3% to $1.46, Stellar (XLM) blew up 23% to $0.163126, and Chainlink (LINK) rallied 15% to $7.98.\n\nChainlink began its rally on Monday with the launch of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on its mainnet. The protocol currently supports Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon networks. It is also integrated with DeFi lending protocols Aave and Synthetix. Chainlink says it is as an onramp for TradFi institutions to get into tokenized digital assets.\n\nThe week\u2019s news\n\nOn Monday, G20 watchdog the Financial Stability Board issued nine top-level recommendations for regulators on overseeing crypto companies and markets. It also issued revised recommendations on the oversight of stablecoins.\n\nThe recommendations are designed to prevent crypto crashes on the scale of FTX and Terra incorporate feedback from the FSB\u2019s public consultation on the topic, including calls for cross-border cooperation between regulators, governance requirements for crypto issuers, and mandatory disclosures for the industry.\n\nThe following day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accepted Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin Spot ETF proposal for official review. This is the second spot ETF application that has moved to the next round, following asset manager titan BlackRock\u2019s on July 13.\n\nExchange operator Nasdaq on Wednesday said it was delaying plans to launch a digital assets custodian service. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman said, \u201cConsidering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the U.S., we\u2019ve made the decision to halt our launch of the U.S. digital assets custodian business and our related efforts to pursue a relevant license.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nShe added the company would \u201cremain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital asset ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThat day, a bipartisan group of Senators introduced a bill that would require decentralized finance (DeFi) services to abide by the same compliance rules as financial firms like banks and centralized crypto exchanges, in a bid to reign in \u201ccriminals, drug traffickers, and hostile state actors such as North Korea.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the UK Treasury rejected a House of Commons Treasury Committee recommendation to classify crypto trading as gambling, stating that it \"firmly disagrees\" with it.\n\nFinally, on Friday, Republican lawmakers in Washington introduced a 212-page bill entitled the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. The bill aims to bring clarity and a \u201cmuch-needed regulatory framework.\u201d\n\nThe act includes a pathway for blockchains to be certified as decentralized. The SEC would have an opportunity to push back against assertions made by token issuers that their projects meet the standard outlined in the act. It also seeks to establish a disclosure regime for the transparency and compliance of digital asset issuers."
