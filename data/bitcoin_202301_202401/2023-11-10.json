        "title": "Bitcoin's Lightning Network: 3 Possible Problems - Investopedia",
        "content": "The Lightning Network is a second layer added to Bitcoin's network, enabling transactions between parties off the main blockchain\u2014called off-chain transactions. Lightning Network has often been advertised as a game-changer in the cryptocurrency's evolution. It is designed to speed up transaction processing times and decrease the associated costs of Bitcoin's blockchain. The lightning network was conceived by two developers, Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon in 2015.\n\nAlthough the Lightning Network has experienced growth and development since its inception, challenges remain. Bitcoin's price fluctuations have prevented the crypto from becoming a widespread payment method for consumer and business transactions. Also, there are costs involved in using Lightning Network.\n\nHere, we highlight what the Lightning Network is designed to solve and three problems that it faces. Also, we review recent developments that could impact and improve the network in the future.\n\nKey Takeaways The Lightning Network is a second layer added to Bitcoin's network, enabling transactions to be done off of the blockchain.\n\nThe Lightning Network is designed to speed up transaction processing times and decrease the associated costs of Bitcoin's blockchain.\n\nHowever, the Lightning Network still has costs associated with it and can be susceptible to fraud or malicious attacks.\n\nBitcoin's price swings may prevent the crypto from becoming a popular payment method, limiting the use of the Lightning Network.\n\nUnderstanding the Lightning Network\n\nAs Bitcoin gains transaction volume, more are processed on its blockchain network. This presents problems because the blockchain, in its current state, isn't designed to scale or process the volume of transactions being made.\n\nBitcoin's Scalability Issue\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain and network are designed to process one block about every 10 minutes. Transactions are sent into a work queue, where they are prioritized by how much the user paid in fees. The more transactions there are, the larger the queue is.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin has faced a scalability issue, meaning there are challenges when the network tries to process more transactions simultaneously. For Bitcoin to process more data, the network needs to scale, allowing more transactions to be processed quicker and more efficiently.\n\nThis network latency has led to higher transaction fees as miners take longer to validate transactions because users pay more to prioritize them.\n\nWhat It Is Designed to Do\n\nThe Lightning Network is a separate blockchain that works in conjunction with Bitcoin's blockchain. In a nutshell, the Lightning Network allows participants to transfer bitcoins between one another much quicker using payment channels. Channels can remain open for further payments or closed when a transaction is complete. Instead of waiting for the main network to get through its work queue for the payment to transfer (sometimes taking more than an hour), the Lightning Network lets users send and receive payments in seconds.\n\n1. It Does Not Solve Bitcoin\u2019s Transaction Fee Problem\n\nLightning Network is often touted as a solution to the problem of Bitcoin\u2019s rising transaction fees. Its proponents claimed that transaction fees, one of the direct consequences of Bitcoin\u2019s clogged network, would come down after the technology took transactions off the main blockchain.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s congestion is among several factors influencing its transaction fees. When the Lightning Network was integrated in 2018, expectations for reduced costs and faster transactions were high among users\u2014but as the graph below shows, average Bitcoin transaction fees increased. There could be many reasons for this, but it demonstrates how ineffective the Lightning Network was at reducing fees.\n\nBlockchain.com\n\nLightning Network Fees\n\nIn addition to standard on-chain transaction charges, users are charged for opening a channel with a routing node. The routing node operator charges fees for providing the Lightning channel to the main network. Fees consist of a base fee and a rate, both chosen by the operator. The base fee remains consistent unless manually changed, and the rate is a percentage of the transaction value.\n\nSo, a node operator could set the base fee at one satoshi and the rate at 0.1%. If a user wanted to send 1,000 satoshi via this node, they would need to pay 2 satoshi to the node (fees on the Lightning Network can be measured in increments of milli-satoshi, so the payments can actually be very small).\n\nLightning fees are generally low because hosting a node is a competitive endeavor. Fees must be low enough to attract users but high enough to bring some benefit to the host. If they are too low, there might be no reason to operate a node\u2014if they are too high, users will likely choose a lower-priced node.\n\nInterestingly (and regardless of node fees), by design, the Lightning Network incorporates fees to try and lower overall fees.\n\n2. Remaining Online at All Times Makes Nodes Susceptible\n\nNodes on the Lightning Network are required to be online at all times to send and receive payments. Since the parties involved in the transaction must be online and use their private keys to sign in, it's possible that the coins could be stolen if the computer hosting the node was compromised.\n\nOffline Transaction Risk\n\nGoing offline creates its own set of problems on the Lightning Network. According to Dryja, it is possible for one of the two parties from a payment channel to close the channel and pocket funds while the other is away. This is known as a Fraudulent Channel Close. There is a period to contest the closing of a channel, but a prolonged absence by one of the parties could result in the expiry of that period.\n\nMalicious Attacks\n\nAnother risk to the network is congestion caused by a malicious attack. If the payment channels become congested, and there's a malicious hack or attack, the participants may not be able to get their money back fast enough due to the congestion.\n\nAccording to Dryja, \"forced expiration of many transactions may be the greatest systemic risk when using the Lightning Network.\"\n\nIf a malicious party creates numerous channels and forces them to expire simultaneously, which would broadcast to the blockchain, the congestion caused could overwhelm the capacity of the block. A malicious attacker might use the congestion to steal funds from parties who are unable to withdraw their funds due to the congestion.\n\n3. Bitcoin's Price Fluctuations\n\nThe Lightning Network is also supposed to herald Bitcoin's viability as a medium for daily transactions. Customers are able to open payment channels with businesses or people they transact with frequently. For example, they can open payment channels with their landlord or favorite e-commerce store and transact using bitcoins.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has less traction as a mainstream payment method than as an investment instrument. The increase in transaction volume is primarily attributed to a rise in trading volume. In other words, Bitcoin's popularity with traders and investors increases its volatility\u2014or price fluctuations\u2014as well as congesting the network and influencing fee increases.\n\nRecent Lightning Network Developments\n\nThere remain challenges with Bitcoin's Lightning Network and its ability to boost scale while simultaneously lowering transaction fees. However, the technology's core team has incorporated new use cases and has been researching additional features. As a result, there have been significant developments that attempt to improve the network.\n\nLarger Payments Via Lightning Network\n\nLightning had initially limited channel size to a maximum of 0.1677 BTC, but in 2020, it was announced that the constraints would be removed so clients could have larger channels. These \"Wumbo\" channels are designed to increase the usage and utility of Lightning Network for consumers and businesses.\n\nCrypto Exchanges\n\nOne of the most promising initial use cases involves cryptocurrency exchanges and financial services platforms. For instance, Kraken and Block's Cash App have integrated the Lighting Network. In September 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced the exchange would integrate the Lightning Network. As one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, this is a significant development for the network.\n\nWatchtowers\n\nWatchtowers are third parties that run to prevent fraud within the Lightning Network. For example, if Sam and Judy are transacting and one of them has malicious intent, they may be able to steal the coins from the other participant by closing the channel.\n\nSo, say Sam and Judy put up an initial deposit of 10,000 BTC, and a transaction of 3,000 BTC has taken place in which Sam purchased goods from Judy. If Judy logs off her system, it is open to possible fraud. Sam could broadcast the initial state, meaning they both get their initial deposits back as if no transactions were done. In other words, Sam would have received 3,000 BTC worth of goods for free.\n\nThis process of closing the channel based on the initial state versus the final state in which all of the transactions have been done is called a fraudulent channel close. The watchtower monitors transactions and prevents fraudulent channel closes by forcing a close on the offending party. It broadcasts a revocation transaction and causes them to forfeit their channel balance to the other party.\n\nIs the Lightning Network Part of Bitcoin? The Lightning Network is a layer 2 (a blockchain that assists a primary blockchain) for the Bitcoin blockchain. It was integrated with Bitcoin in 2018.\n\nHow Do You Use the Bitcoin Lightning Network? To complete transactions using the Bitcoin Lightning Network, you will need to use a Lightning-compatible wallet.\n\n\n\nHow Fast Is the Bitcoin Lightning Network? The Lightning Network can reportedly process millions of transactions per second. The main Bitcoin blockchain can process around seven a second.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Lightning Network is a tool that could make a significant difference to Bitcoin's blockchain. However, the network might not solve all of the challenges Bitcoin faces. While improvements are being made, there's the potential for new problems within the cryptocurrency's ecosystem because it remains an ever-evolving technology.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Here's Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Back From the Dead - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Is bitcoin back? Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer\n\nFor the entirety of crypto\u2019s existence, a large part of digital currency\u2019s appeal was how strange it all was. From its 2008 inception, bitcoin was this new kind of anti-government money, perfect for someone to buy drugs with online anonymously, even as it was susceptible to getting lost or thrown out on garbage day. There were the copycat fads \u2014 the \u201cinitial coin offering\u201d bubble of 2017, the shitcoin mania of 2021 \u2014 as well as the truly weird and dumb stuff, like the NFTs of monkeys that were, briefly, fodder for the art world. Whatever your opinion of all these things, they made many people very, very rich \u2014 at least for a little while, on paper. This year, though, has been different. After last year\u2019s market collapse and last week\u2019s conviction of crypto-fraud kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried, what\u2019s weird about it all isn\u2019t some new trend or some new offense to good taste. On Thursday, crypto had one of its best days in 18 months, and it has everything to do with abandoning its rebel origins and getting approval from Wall Street giants and government regulators.\n\nA single bitcoin rose briefly to nearly $38,000 on Thursday, the highest that it\u2019s been since the early days of the total market collapse triggered by the vaporization of two of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrencies, terraUSD and luna, in early 2022. Why did it rise from the dead all of a sudden? Crypto investors have a big new story to tell \u2014 and since the price of bitcoin isn\u2019t tied to a physical asset, like oil, or the economic might of a country, like the U.S. dollar, it lives and dies by how persuasive its story is on any given day. This time, the narrative seems to be about crypto growing up and getting a haircut, a suit, and a real job \u2014 on Wall Street. Specifically, the Securities and Exchange Commission appeared to be getting closer to green-lighting an exchange-traded fund from investment behemoth BlackRock that would allow investors to buy bitcoin as easily as they buy the S&P 500. (An ETF trades just like a stock but can represent an index or commodity or a nearly endless variety of other financial bets.) And it wasn\u2019t just bitcoin. Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-most-popular crypto, was also reaching highs not seen since April, topping $2,000 per token, after BlackRock registered a corporate entity in Delaware for an ethereum ETF.\n\nBitcoin is at $37,000 and no one is talking about it. Nobody is saying anything!\n\n\n\nHas anyone checked the price?\n\n\n\nWhy is no one tweeting about crypto?\n\n\n\nHello?\n\n\n\nBitcoin is up a lot!\n\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t anyone see it? \u2014 Zack Voell (@zackvoell) November 9, 2023\n\nFor Wall Street to finally start trading ETFs of bitcoin or ethereum would truly begin a new era in the world of cryptocurrencies. ETFs are part of the finance industry\u2019s lifeblood, and an industry unto itself that, as of last year, was worth $6.5 trillion. At its core, a crypto ETF would make it easier for financial institutions (your pensions, mutual funds, hedge funds, and the like), and the average 401(k) holder, to easily trade and profit from the digital currencies without having to worry about encryption keys, or getting hacked, or anything like that. (At least, not directly. If BlackRock got its bitcoin hacked, though, that would be very bad.) Bitcoin ETFs have largely been a pipe dream for the last ten years, since the Winklevoss twins first tried to get government approval for one. (The SEC rejected it four years later.) What changed recently was a lawsuit from Grayscale, a company owned by Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group, a big (if currently troubled) player in the crypto space. In August, an appeals court ruled that the SEC had arbitrarily denied Grayscale\u2019s application for its own ETF, which would have used many of the same market-surveillance and safety protocols that other funds used. Last month, the SEC said it wouldn\u2019t appeal the decision, making the appearance of an ETF all but assured. \u201cThis was fully expected in my eyes and was just a matter of when, not if,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said. \u201cBut BlackRock\u2019s name is obviously huge and just seeing this registration in Delaware sent ether prices skyrocketing.\u201d\n\nAll this appears to fly in the face of what made crypto so \u2026 crypto-y. This was, after all, the money that was most closely associated with Occupy Wall Street and that Jamie Dimon has called a \u201cfraud.\u201d The spike in prices is of the kind that would typically come from secret, anonymous Telegram \u201cpump\u201d groups that would disappear just as soon as they made their profits. That its value is getting pumped because regulators are now okay with it and the likes of BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion in assets, are getting in on it, is deeply weird and hilarious \u2014 not only because it\u2019s the opposite of what it symbolized for so long, but because \u2026 what\u2019s the difference? For most people who own a bitcoin, what matters is that the price is going to go higher (a.k.a. \u201cnumber go up\u201d), not any of the high-flying rhetoric about its ability make each holder a sovereign wealth fund unto themselves. Maybe this is why Gary Gensler, the SEC chair and chief antagonist of the crypto markets, came out recently and suggested that FTX could soon get relaunched as a crypto exchange, now that Bankman-Fried is no longer a threat. After his remarks, the price of FTX\u2019s digital currency, long assumed to be dead by most investors, spiked by 90 percent \u2014 one of its best days ever."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Global Hegemony - Geopoliticalmonitor.com",
        "content": "Both empirical realities and existing predictions show the usefulness and potential of Bitcoin as an instrument of national power in the practice of statecraft and also as a versatile element that could serve various roles under confrontational geopolitical conditions. However, it is unclear at this point if BTC and similar nonstate cybercurrencies could influence the fate of global hegemony. The historical record shows a strong symbiotic connection between the architecture of international monetary systems and political realities related to the global balance of power and the systemic structure of polarity. Specifically, major reserve currencies have always been issued by hegemonic great powers and underwritten by the strength that those superior positions confer. Such has been the case since the days of the Athenian drachma, the Roman denarius and the Byzantine solidus to the US dollar. In this regard, could the disruptiveness of unofficial cryptocurrencies like BTC have implications for the evolution of hegemony and the redistribution of the global correlation of forces in the coming decades? Admittedly, there is no hard conclusive evidence at this point but, from a long-range perspective, their existence is a relatively recent phenomenon, and the ultimate extent of their conceivable geopolitical ramifications remains unknown. After all, the arc of the so-called longue dur\u00e9e brings both predictable cyclical patterns and wild cards whose behaviour is hard to anticipate. Therefore, the formulation of an answer requires the practice of strategic foresight to assess multiple hypothetical possibilities and to determine how each could reshape hegemony. In order to do so, the present analysis integrates the scrutiny of forecasts, scenarios and perspectives. In particular, it seeks to identify the plausible implications of said cybercurrency for the hegemonic position still held by the United States as the leading superpower and the supremacy of the US dollar as the world\u2019s top reserve currency.\n\nBTC\u2019s potential as a major reserve currency\n\nThe idea of a major global reserve currency not controlled by any national state is not new. In the context of the Bretton Woods conference, British economist John Maynard Keynes proposed the idea of launching a supranational monetary unit, called \u201cBancor,\u201d which would be backed by gold, a plan that was \u2012 unsurprisingly \u2012 not welcomed by Washington. No sane statesmen would have missed the opportunity to achieve global monetary and financial superiority as a war booty. In the post-Cold War era, the rise of Bitcoin endorses once more the hypothetical scenario of a de-nationalized global currency that cannot be unilaterally controlled in accordance with the particular interests of a single state. Hence, some observers believe that the dollar\u2019s hegemonic position will not be inherited by another national currency, but by an unconventional new generation of monetary assets and \u2012 as the most emblematic cybercurrency \u2012 Bitcoin could become one of the largest reserve currencies. In fact, since it was created, Bitcoin\u2019s staunchest supporters have entertained the libertarian dream of a borderless currency that is freely available to everybody as an alternative to fiat money, seen as inherently inferior and problematic in all meaningful respects.\n\nThe introduction of stateless cryptocurrencies like BTC represents a potential catalyst for the renewal of the global monetary order or, at the very least, for a growing diversification. In theory, a virtual currency like Bitcoin could evolve and potentially act as an item that performs all the roles associated with money on a global scale: medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. In fact, Bitcoin\u2019s promoters contend that it represents a game changer that offers many advantages over traditional currencies and even gold: algorithmic programming, transnational circuits and apolitical governance. Furthermore, as its organic financial ecosystem has grown, it has attracted the involvement of mainstream economic agents \u2012 including online retail business platforms, start-up companies, traditional financial firms and exchanges \u2012 increasing its projection well beyond the narrow confines of marginal sectors. At some point, BTC could gain a much higher degree of traction for all sorts of cross-border payments, even though it would have to face meaningful regulatory obstacles. Such development would challenge not just the dollar\u2019s hegemony, but also the legitimacy of other economic paradigms such as fiat money and fractional reserve banking.\n\nYet, the idea that BTC will become a major reserve currency should not be taken for granted. There are reasonable doubts motivated by technical, economic and political obstacles. Since Bitcoin\u2019s structural design determines that no more than 21 million units can exist, this limited money supply does not offer the volume that a reserve currency would need to play a much larger role in international commercial or financial transactions through systemic platforms. Despite the hype around them, unofficial cryptocurrencies are innovations still in their developmental infancy and none of them has been technically designed to act as a universal currency. Another important factor is the volatile fluctuations of Bitcoin\u2019s exchange rates. Said instability is problematic because rather than an item that performs reliably as international money, Bitcoin behaves more like an unstable speculative asset with no intrinsic worth that is traded for quick profits and usually exchanged for more traditional forms of wealth. Notably, its sceptics even argue that Bitcoin might trigger a speculative bubble whose eventual collapse would mirror the proportions and trajectory of the \u2018tulipmania\u2019 speculative frenzy that took place in the Dutch Golden Age, back when Amsterdam operated as the world\u2019s top financial nerve center.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most important difficulty is that BTC lacks the political support of a powerful state. In order to reach a much higher degree of international projection, it would require a measure like its adoption as some sort of anchor for a hard currency, either national or regional. Without such ingredient, its strength would be feeble. No currency in world history has become dominant on a global scale without the active backing of a great power. In contrast, as the American private intelligence firm STRATFOR observes, the dollar is underwritten by the full national power of the United States, including its military capabilities, manpower, economic wealth, infrastructure, institutional systems, land, culture and infrastructure. Needless to say, Bitcoin does not have anything even remotely comparable. In addition, most national states are unlikely to relinquish the benefits that come with their sovereign ability to control the implementation of their own monetary policies.\n\nIn a nutshell, the predictions about a widespread global adoption of Bitcoin are, at best, premature. The potential of any first-generation cybercurrency \u2012 including BTC \u2012 to become a major reserve currency in the near future is regarded as negligible by most experts. Specifically, Bitcoin is no suitable candidate to overtake the American dollar any time soon. In the best-case scenario, BTC could be a minor reserve currency. However, the prospect of their increased international presence in the long run could incrementally downsize the strategic advantages that the US gets as a result of the dollar\u2019s hegemonic position and even provide an instrument of statecraft to advance a partial de-dollarization. As such, their potential condition as alternative or secondary reserve currencies is worth considering, especially in an environment of heightened financial and geopolitical turmoil.\n\nBTC as a vector of a counter-hegemonic grand strategy\n\nThe growing international projection of decentralized cybercurrencies like Bitcoin is a trend that could create a much more fragmentary, horizontal and plural global monetary order. Another important systemic trajectory that needs to be highlighted is the rising great power competition in the strategic chessboard of money and finance. Considering their disruptive nature, crypto-assets have the theoretical potential to challenge the position held by the dollar as the hegemonic currency since Bretton Woods and the collective West\u2019s ability to implement coercive sanctions. They could therefore be harnessed strategically by revisionist great powers that seek to encourage de-dollarization, further multipolarity and develop parallel monetary and financial systems. Some observers warn that the next major hegemonic confrontation might not involve military conflict in traditional battlefields, but competing financial structures. In turn, certain experts hold that, despite its ideological hostility to BTC\u2019s libertarian background, China might attempt to manipulate BTC in as an unconventional weapon in an attempt to target the dollar\u2019s prestige and challenge American global financial leadership. Such possibility has evident implications for American national security. These concerns are shared by prominent members of US high finance elite. American hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio has warned about an eventual \u201ccapital war\u201d as one of the facets of the increasingly complex rising rivalry between China and the US.\n\nInterestingly, Professor Nicholas Ross Smith argues that, as a great power that intends to rewrite the architecture of the global system, Russia could also be interested in the counter-hegemonic properties of Bitcoin as an instrument of statecraft that might foster a more multipolar correlation of forces. Moscow cannot directly compete with the US in the field of money, but it can rely on stateless cryptocurrencies as weaponized asymmetric vectors of grand strategy to diminish the international strength of the greenback. Said measure would reduce the power and influence of the US in the system of global financial and monetary governance and worsen American financial imbalances, including unsustainable levels of indebtedness. Moscow could even become a hub for independent cryptocurrencies like BTC. Moreover, it has been noted that the reassessment of Russia\u2019s initial reluctance to embrace cryptocurrencies towards a more permissive attitude is likely related to the Kremlin\u2019s strategic interest in alternatives worth leveraging to weaken the dollar. Another strategic advantage of nonstate cryptocurrencies for Russian national interests would be their pragmatic applications for compensating the prospect of an overreliance on Chinese financial platforms connected to the renminbi.\n\nHowever, it is not entirely clear is such course of action could achieve the expected outcome. There are limits that China and/or Russia would have to be overcome in order to sponsor a much larger presence of Bitcoin in cross-border payments, including the need to develop an accompanying financial infrastructure. Another disadvantage for Bitcoin to achieve a much stronger international role is this cryptocurrency\u2019s high levels of financial volatility. Although this strategy could be helpful to avert financial and monetary arteries controlled by the United States, it is unlikely to displace the dollar. At best, it could partially erode its position, but not sink the greenback.\n\nBTC as an element that could strengthen \u2018Pax Americana\u2019\n\nIn an article for Bitcoin Magazine, Luke Mikic puts forward the counterintuitive forecast that, rather than weakening it \u2012 as conventional wisdom would suggest \u2012 the growing monetization of BTC will actually extend the lifespan of the US dollar as the hegemonic reserve currency. In a context shaped by both the accumulation of structural financial problems and the rising assertiveness of revisionist states which actively seek to undermine the greenback\u2019s global supremacy, it would make sense to back the dollar with the leading cryptocurrency in order to hasten the renewal of the global monetary order with a dollar supported by BTC under Washington\u2019s leadership. Said analyst argues that a bitcoin-backed dollar would be able to overcome the challenge posed by the monetary alternatives being developed by China and, to a lesser extent, Russia. A report published by the Bitcoin Policy Institute states that BTC offers strategic advantages worth harnessing to strengthen the US position as the leading superpower. This source specifies that, rather than trying to suppress it, Washington should rely of BTC as an asset to support the development of technological innovation, expand capital markets, counter Beijing\u2019s efforts to boost RMB internationalization through its digital currency and FinTech projects, project the \u2018soft power\u2019 of American values and even finance opposition to hostile regimes. This course of action would reshuffle the global monetary order \u2012 with Bitcoin as its cornerstone, much like gold during the Bretton Woods era \u2012 in a favorable way for the US national interests. In this way, perhaps Washington could try to avert a hegemonic transition. If successful, such event would be a major \u2018black swan,\u2019 a surprising event whose impact would be felt for generations.\n\nBTC proliferation as a mirror that reflects a declining US hegemony\n\nBitcoin\u2019s symbolical significance has not gone unnoticed. It has been noted that its creation, in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, was a phenomenon driven \u2012 to a certain extent \u2012 by concerns about the trustworthiness of the dollar as the dominant reserve currency. According to Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar, the rise of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies is a systemic trend that should not be interpreted as a temporary financial bubble. Instead, said commentator explains that, from a long-range perspective, the proliferation of such cybercurrencies represents a perception of growing skepticism about the US dollar \u2012 as a result of mounting levels of indebtedness and unsound monetary policies \u2012 and also as a symptom of a tectonic shift that favors an increasing geopolitical multipolarity. In other words, BTC symbolizes that a new global monetary and geopolitical order might be underway. Not long ago, Credit Suisse analyst Zoltan Pozsar anticipated that BTC will benefit from a new Bretton Woods, an era that will likely be shaped by a weaker dollar, a stronger renminbi, intensifying financial volatility and the growing presence of \u201coutside money,\u201d including gold and other commodities whose hardness is underpinned by their intrinsic value. In this interpretation, BTC and similar nonstate cybercurrencies herald a Zeitgeist of rising pluralism, both monetary and geopolitical.\n\nBTC as a source of inspiration to develop alternatives to the USD\n\nAs explained in a previous section, the potential of Bitcoin to overtake the US dollar is limited. However, its introduction could inspire a chain reaction that leads to the creation of later generations of virtual currencies \u2012 perhaps underpinned by monetary connections to hard assets such as gold and linked to their own digital financial infrastructures \u2012 intended to challenge the dollar\u2019s hegemony. For instance, James Rickards anticipates that China or Russia could hypothetically link BTC with gold as a measure to hasten the demise of the dollar. Interestingly, a report published by the Valdai Discussion Club, an influential Russian think tank, states that since cryptocurrencies are promising vehicles for cross-border settlements and payments, it is a matter of time before their current drawbacks are addressed through projects which offer innovative improvements. In a French book about the geopolitics of cryptocurrencies Nancy Gomez and Patrick Pasin even explore several hypothetical prospects of multilateral digital currencies for the BRICS bloc, the Russophone areas of the post-Soviet space under Moscow\u2019s leadership, the Latin American members of ALBA and even for nations of Turkic heritage, amongst others. In such a way, the intellectual influence of BTC could indirectly give birth to the design of alternative creations that do have the critical mass to compete with the greenback. Based on the extrapolation of current trends, it looks like the projects of the BRICS states, ASEAN nations and Middle Eastern oil exporters \u2012 along with other members of the so-called \u201cGlobal South\u201d \u2012 to de-dollarize their international economic exchanges are likely to take off in the coming years and newer generations of cutting-edge digital currencies could be involved in such pursuit. Regardless of what its creators intended and even if it cannot reshuffle the global balance of power by itself, BTC may have helped release the genie from the bottle and now there is no way to put it back. Yet, it is too soon to determine categorically if the monetary Rubicon has been crossed.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nAnticipating what the future might bring is always a challenging intellectual endeavor, but the analysis of plausible developments and scenarios to identify their potential strategic ramifications and assess their feasibility can be done based on historical precedents, a multidisciplinary worldview and the extrapolation of rising trends. Together, these exploratory predictions and perspectives give credence to the prospect that BTC and nonstate crypto-assets might be consequential in more than one way for the evolution of global hegemony.\n\nHowever, it would not be wise to overestimate the weight of their direct or indirect influence. By themselves, Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies lack the critical mass to alter the global balance of power. Yet, their pivotal significance in the eventual redefinition of the global order might be substantially increased if the international system\u2019s major powers (including both those that support the current status quo and those that harbor revisionist interests) harness them in their ongoing strategic competition. After all, money is \u2012 as German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche defined it \u2012 \u201cthe crowbar of power\u201d so it remains to be seen if stateless crypto-assets play a role as chess pieces in the greatest of all games: the pursuit of hegemony.\n\n**This article was originally published on April 11, 2023"

        "content": "Popular cryptocurrency analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has updated his outlook on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ahead of the expected approval of BlackRock Inc.'s (NYSE:BLK) spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWhat Happened: According to van de Poppe, Bitcoin has almost entered its first year of bull run, after spending one year in the bear market territory and one year in the accumulation phase.\n\n\"We've witnessed a one-year bear market. We've witnessed the one-year accumulation. And now we're getting ourselves into the period of the first year of the bull cycle,\" van de Poppe said in his latest note.\n\nSee Also: Bitcoin\u2019s Current Uptick Just The Start, Benzinga Pinpoints 3 Major Catalysts Ahead\n\nBitcoin has surged over 38% in the last month alone, crossing the $37,000 mark, so the question among investors and traders who have missed out on the rally is whether now is a good time to buy Bitcoin.\n\nGoing by van de Poppe's analysis, the Bitcoin rally still has legs \u2014 he said that there is still a potential upside of nearly 50% from the existing level of $37,000.\n\n\"Most likely, the high is going to be around $50,000 to $55,000,\" he said.\n\n\"At this point, the confirmation of the bear market to be over is almost close to 100%, especially with the breakout of $28,000 and holding the 200-week EMA (exponential moving average) for Bitcoin,\" he explained.\n\nAccording to van de Poppe's charts, one Bitcoin cycle is spread across four years: one-year bear market, one-year accumulation and a two-year bull run. With the bear and accumulation phases now over, van de Poppe believes there are two years of Bitcoin bull run ahead of us.\n\n\"Coming two years are going to be great,\" van de Poppe said.\n\nMy friends, buy the dips.Coming two years are going to be great.\n\n\u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 10, 2023\n\nAnother factor that is playing into the recent strength in the king of crypto is the Bitcoin halving event, anticipated to take place in 2024.\n\nThis will halve the rewards for mining new blocks of Bitcoin, reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are mined. This will, in turn, create scarcity and lead to a price appreciation.\n\nThe confluence of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin halving event and a perceived undervaluation are all pointing at a potential bull run ahead, even though crypto critics like Peter Schiff are not convinced.\n\nRead Next: Welcome To \u2018The Acceleration Phase\u2019: Analyst Predicts An 88% Increase For Bitcoin\n\nPhoto by 99Art on Shutterstock\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022.\n\nJust under a year later, bitcoin isn't dead \u2013 it's thriving.\n\nThe cryptocurrency, which remains the largest digital asset by total market cap, has more than doubled in price since Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire crumbled, jumping 105% to just under $37,000 over the past 12 months.\n\nOn Thursday, it jumped to an 18-month high after racking up a 4% surge in the space of just 24 hours.\n\nPut bitcoin's gains in perspective, and its stellar rally this year feels even more impressive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe token's 120% surge in 2023 means it's not only beating benchmark indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2013 it's also outperformed the much-vaunted \"Magnificent Seven\". That increasingly-dominant group of Big Tech stocks is up 95% year-to-date, by Insider's calculations.\n\nThose gains have come after a nightmarish 2022 for the entire digital-asset space. As well as the failure of FTX, crypto prices were rocked by the collapse of other big firms including stablecoin issuer Terra, lender Celsius Network, and the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.\n\nETF expectations\n\nSteadily growing speculation about the Securities and Exchange Commission potentially approving a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund has powered bitcoin's comeback.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimated there was a 90% chance that such a vehicle \u2013 which would allow big US-based institutional investors to buy crypto \u2013 would be approved before January 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile dozens of big-name firms have filed spot ETF applications with the SEC, perhaps the highest-profile has been BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with more than $9 trillion under management.\n\nBitcoin has jumped over 40% since BlackRock applied to have its ETF approved on June 15. CEO Larry Fink has said he believes a successful spot fund would help \"democratize crypto\" and make it cheaper to trade the token.\n\nAnother factor driving bitcoin's comeback is low supply available on the market, with long-term investors holding onto their stashes as they wait for prices to climb higher. The amount of bitcoin in circulation is currently extremely low, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nBullish predictions\n\nTraders are also gearing up for a so-called \"halving\" event that's expected to happen mid-2024. Industry veterans believe that event \u2013 when the number of bitcoins awarded to miners is cut in half \u2013 could push prices beyond $100,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it's not just crypto bulls getting excited about bitcoin's rally.\n\nSome big banks have started to issue headline-grabbing price predictions once again in recent months, after shrugging off the token's rally for much of this year.\n\nIn July, UK-based lender Standard Chartered predicted that bitcoin would surge to $120,000 next year with miners likely to cling onto their holdings, while last week Bernstein shared a $150,000 price target.\n\n\"You may not like bitcoin as much as we do, but a dispassionate view of bitcoin as a commodity suggests a turn of the cycle,\" Bernstein managing director Gautam Chhugani said in a report. \"A good idea is only as good as its timing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FTX fiasco took its latest sorry turn earlier this month when Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven counts of fraud \u2013 which could land the exchange's founder up to 110 years in prison.\n\nBut rather than falling from grace alongside the disgraced former billionaire, bitcoin's price has steadily risen \u2013 in a sign that even one of the biggest financial frauds in US history hasn't killed crypto."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Were Up Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto industry is once again moving higher, and three of the biggest cryptocurrencies are leading the way. As of 2 p.m. ET Friday, Bitcoin (BTC -4.07%) was up by 3% from where it traded when the stock market closed Thursday, Ethereum (ETH -3.87%) was up 4%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 0.69%) was up 5.3%.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been volatile over the past year, but have been charging higher since mid-October.\n\nBehind the rise in cryptocurrencies\n\nThe biggest news out relating to crypto Friday is that BlackRock (BLK -1.99%) is pursuing an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), just as it has been trying to get permission to launch a Bitcoin ETF. There are already ways for investors to buy crypto on traditional exchanges, but they're not as efficient as ETFs, which is why BlackRock and others are trying to get ETFs approved.\n\nIn theory, more options for investing in crypto will lead to more money pouring into tokens, which will drive prices higher. That's why traders are getting out in front of any ETF approvals, and they could bid values higher.\n\nRight now, the barrier preventing such ETFs from reaching the market is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has neither approved crypto ETFs nor laid out rules around cryptocurrencies in general. That has left the industry in limbo, and Congress has yet to agree on a regulatory framework for crypto either. Based on BlackRock's involvement, many investors speculate that ETFs could be the one way to make crypto more mainstream as the SEC and Congress wait to act.\n\nThe interesting thing is, it's not just Bitcoin and Ethereum that are moving higher on the speculation about Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs -- all of the major cryptocurrencies are moving higher as investors expect there will eventually be a flood of crypto ETF products.\n\nGrowth on the blockchain\n\nDespite the drop in crypto prices over the last couple of years, the industry continues to develop, and businesses and developers are creating more meaningful projects on blockchains. Visa is testing using blockchains to complete payments, and so are Shopify and MercadoLibre. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of other projects underway at companies around the world.\n\nThis is the kind of activity that's going to drive value to cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, but investors are currently just speculating about possible future value creation. I tend to think there will be value, but the moves recently aren't necessarily indicative of long-term value.\n\nWhat I would watch for is where developers are building on the blockchain. It's not Bitcoin or Dogecoin that are getting activity -- it's blockchains like Ethereum and Solana that are built for utility and more activity that will ultimately benefit.\n\nI would also expect to see the jump in value subside even if ETFs are approved, based on the \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" pattern. That's why I'm not jumping in on the crypto bounce right now. But I will hold on for the ride as this industry matures."

        "content": "Benzinga\n\nWall Street's tech giants continued to extend their gains in the week following the Federal Reserve\u2019s November meeting. The Nasdaq 100 once again outperformed other major indices, driven by the Magnificent 7, which includes artificial intelligence winners and tech stocks with the highest market capitalization, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nThe Dow's blue-chip stocks stalled, while small caps plummeted, retracing more than half of the previous week's gains. Energy was again the weakest performer among sectors.\n\nMicrosoft hot on Apple's trail\n\nThe tech giant Microsoft reached a new all-time high, surpassing $367 per share on Friday, solidifying its position as a major AI winner. Microsoft\u2019s market capitalization has now reached $2.73 trillion, trailing Apple's by just $150 billion.\n\nBitcoin now worth more than Tesla\n\nBitcoin marked its fourth consecutive week of gains amid reports the SEC has initiated talks with Grayscale regarding its application to transform its GBTC trust product into a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product. The total value of all outstanding Bitcoin crossed the $750 billion mark, surpassing Tesla\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nBlackRock set to launch Ethereum ETF\n\nThe world's largest asset management firm, BlackRock, signaled interest in launching an Ethereum exchange-traded fund on Thursday, a bullish sign for the digital assets space.\n\nFed's caution snaps stocks' win streak\n\nA relatively hawkish speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday ended the U.S. stock market's longest daily winning streak in over two years. The setback came when Powell suggested that while the Fed is in no hurry to raise interest rates as inflation cools, he did not rule out another hike. He said there is still a substantial distance to cover to achieve the 2% target.\n\nDueling economic outlooks\n\nNotable investment firms published their economic outlooks for 2024 this past week. While Goldman Sachs still foresees a well-above-consensus growth for the U.S. economy, Wells Fargo presents a rather pessimistic outlook.\n\nWalt Disney's latest quarter results have a bright side\n\nDisney reported fourth-quarter (fiscal year 2023) revenue of $21.24 billion, a 5% year-over-year increase, albeit falling short of Street expectations. The company's earnings per share of 82 cents surpassed the Street consensus estimate of 70 cents per share. Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne reiterated the stock should perform better in the future.\n\nThe week ahead\n\nAll eyes will be on the consumer price index report for October, scheduled for release Tuesday. Economists anticipate that core inflation will hold steady at 4.1% year-on-year.\n\nOn Wednesday, the highlights will include the producer price index and retail sales data. Additionally, several Federal Reserve speakers are expected to provide insights throughout the week.\n\nMore:Lower income workers face a big challenge for retirement. What's keeping them from saving\n\nMore:Apple Pay, Venmo, Google Pay would see more regulation under proposed rule from feds\n\nAmong the mega-cap U.S. companies scheduled to announce earnings next week are Home Depot on Tuesday, Cisco Systems on Wednesday and Walmart and Applied Materials on Thursday.\n\nBenzinga is a financial news and data company headquartered in Detroit."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Price Predictions Are Unreliable - Investopedia",
        "content": "It's a phenomenon familiar to anyone who follows the cryptocurrency industry. A prominent figure\u2014the CEO of a digital currency exchange, a key developer or researcher, a successful cryptocurrency investor\u2014makes a dramatic prediction about the price of Bitcoin or the general movement of the digital currency sphere.\n\nAs is usually the case in the financial world, sometimes these predictions come to pass. But more often than not, these predictions never come to fruition. Nonetheless, many analysts and experts continue to make price predictions for Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and investors still seem to take heed.\n\nBelow, we'll explore why any cryptocurrency investor should take a price prediction with a good degree of skepticism.\n\nKey Takeaways Cryptocurrency investors should take a price prediction with a good degree of skepticism.\n\nOne of the major problems with many price predictions about bitcoin is that they lack sufficient analytical support to back up their claims.\n\nSome prominent figures in the industry who push for sky-high prices are doing so for reasons that may not be linked to fundamentals.\n\nBitcoin prices are mostly influenced by traders unless there is an event that triggers exuberant or panic investing.\n\nEasy to Believe\n\nOne of the major problems with many price predictions about Bitcoin is that they lack sufficient analytical support to back up their claims. An outlandish price point, particularly one in the upward direction, is always going to be tempting to investors; someone holding a cryptocurrency currently priced at $100 can easily be swayed to believe that the token will skyrocket to $10,000 simply because they want it to be true and it has happened in the past. However, the issue is that many predictions are delivered without evidence and proper analysis to support them.\n\nHype, Not Fundamentals\n\nIn many instances, cryptocurrency is overhyped by notable figures, business owners heavily invested in digital assets, or others who have an interest in profiting if prices rise. However, there are no fundamentals behind most cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo be fair, there are some bonafide businesses or other entities that have created blockchain solutions. These have tokens that are used for specific purposes on these blockchains, but they tend to make their way onto exchanges in hopes of quick riches. But these blockchain solutions also have a company behind them, possibly with stocks trading on a traditional exchange or over the counter. They'll have assets like equipment, people, and intellectual property that add value.\n\nInvesting in these companies may have better results in the long run if they have a blockchain product or service that is truly useful. For example, the banana farm in Loas funded by a cryptocurrency sale, with coins redeemable in Loatian bananas? Not so useful. A blockchain with a native token designed to increase traditional finance transaction times, cross-border payments, and stability? Possibly useful.\n\nA cryptocurrency issued for the sake of being a cryptocurrency and hoping for a return is genuinely worthless.\n\nStubborn Stances\n\nIn many cases, the forecast may come from an \"analyst\" with a \"permabull\" stance. These forecasters may turn out to be right\u2014anyone can plot a trend line on a graph and make a prediction. Eventually, someone will be right, and they'll be touted as the latest expert to listen to. You've likely seen a headline like \"Analyst that predicted a price of XYZ and was right, now forecasts ABC!\"\u2014and some will listen.\n\nSome might take an opposing stance, predicting that the markets will fall to a certain price. There is a chance that it will happen, and that person will be lauded as the one who knows\u2014and again, some will listen.\n\nSome analysts use the broken clock method\u2014even a broken clock is right twice a day\u2014to make predictions. At some point, they will be right.\n\nSpeculation\n\nIt's true that a significant number of cryptocurrency millionaires are out there who made lots of money from early investments in the space. But this was pure speculation at that point. Even though prices are continually rising over time, like the stock market, Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies remain speculative to this day because they are driven by emotion and desire.\n\nMedia and News\n\nLike analysts, many media outlets want to be the ones that \"were there\" in the trenches with the traders and investors. Being the first to report is a big deal, so when there are whispers or speculation about a development, it is quickly disseminated to the masses. Case in point\u2014in October 2023, an employee at an outlet accidentally published a social media post about a Bitcoin Spot ETF, something many investors, brokerages, and financial management firms have been clamoring for. Bitcoin's price spiked more than $2,000 over several hours before dropping when fans realized it wasn't true, and the outlet released an apology.\n\nTradingView\n\nThis is a prime example of what happens in speculative investments. Investors (in reality, those who buy and hold bitcoin are speculators) succumb to the fear of missing out (FOMO) on an opportunity for large and quick profits.\n\nTrading\n\nCritical to prices is volume, and bitcoins are traded at an average of $24 billion per day. Trading activity is guided by price speculation on the part of traders\u2014people using bitcoins in transactions generally don't create any influence on prices because there isn't enough buying volume or enough payments being made to affect demand and supply. So, realistically, analysts use price data influenced by traders and investors to create predictions.\n\nWhat Will $100 of Bitcoin Be Worth in 2030? It is difficult to tell how much 1 BTC will be worth because its price varies so often and wildly. Between 2017 and 2023, its average price has slowly trended upward amidst large swings in both directions. So, it might go up or down\u2014if it is even still around.\n\nHow Much Is Bitcoin Worth in US Dollars? On Nov. 10, 2023, 1 BTC was worth $37,311.86, up nearly $21,000 from January 2023.\n\nHow Much Did Bitcoin Cost in 2010? In 2010, 1 BTC was worth between $0.1 and $0.2.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTaking a step away from issues with forecasters themselves, a cryptocurrency investor should always keep in mind that the cryptocurrency industry itself is inherently challenging to analyze. Even the developers of the top digital currencies in the world have a difficult time keeping tabs on all of the latest coins, tokens, companies, and developments.\n\nAnd, even assuming that one person could manage to successfully filter out the useful information in an ever-growing pipeline related to the digital currency space, the fact that the industry is so young and largely untested means that there is little by way of prior proven models, theories and strategies in place to help assess where things have been and where they're going.\n\nEven when a price prediction makes use of analysis in a sophisticated and appropriate way, there are always going to be many factors that the cryptocurrency community simply does not know about yet. This can, of course, be said for investing in general, but it is arguably even more of a concern in the nascent digital currency space. All of this is to say that investors in virtual currencies should keep a healthy dose of skepticism when news of the latest price prediction becomes available.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "After a disappointing 2022, Bitcoin (BTC -4.31%) is having a remarkable bounce-back year, as its price has skyrocketed 115% in 2023 (as of Nov. 10). Nonetheless, this leading cryptocurrency remains 47% below its all-time high price.\n\nBut with Bitcoin experiencing strong momentum in recent weeks, investors probably have their eyes set on a new milestone. Can this top digital asset reach $100,000, which translates to a roughly 170% return from today's price?\n\nHere's why I think that's a real possibility.\n\nUpcoming catalysts\n\nThe current period is rare in that it's a time when Bitcoin could benefit from three potential catalysts in the near term, all of which could propel its price to new heights. The first one is what's on everyone's mind these days, and that's the pending approvals of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A long list of major asset management firms, like BlackRock, Fidelity, and WisdomTree, among others, have all filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with a hard deadline for a decision coming in January 2024.\n\nNot only would this place a stamp of approval on Bitcoin, making it a legitimate financial asset that leading traditional financial companies are involved with, but it would provide a convenient, regulatory-friendly way for many investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price without having to directly own the digital asset. It's not hard to see Bitcoin's price surging should the SEC approve these applications.\n\nThe other potential catalyst is a more accommodative central bank. For the last year and a half, the Federal Reserve has aggressively hiked interest rates to combat inflation, and this policy stance might continue. However, should Fed Chair Jay Powell and his team believe that they are making serious progress toward taming inflation, then perhaps they will not only pause rate increases but start to lower them sometime next year.\n\nLooser monetary policy is typically a boon for risky assets like stocks and Bitcoin. With interest rates lower, investors are willing to take on more risk to achieve a certain level of return. And this could draw more capital toward Bitcoin.\n\nWhile these first two catalysts aren't certain to happen, the next one is. Bitcoin's inflation rate gets cut in half roughly every four years. This is called a halving. The next halving is expected to happen in April 2024, at which point Bitcoin's new supply schedule will give it a much lower annual inflation rate than gold. This is important because demand that has trended higher over time, coupled with a reduced supply, should lead to a rising price.\n\nBitcoin's history tells this same story. In the months leading up to a halving, through the months following this event, the digital asset's price has entered a strong bull market. This means now is one of the best times to be a buyer.\n\nEven more impressive, despite its volatility, Bitcoin has always managed to eclipse its previous high to reach a new one. Of course, past results aren't indicative of future returns, but if history is any indication, there's a good chance that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 in the next few years.\n\nSize accordingly\n\nIt's easy to get bullish on Bitcoin, but investors should first assess their own risk tolerance before adding it to their portfolios. A tiny allocation (maybe 1%) might be a good place to start.\n\nThen, over time, the goal should be to continue learning more about Bitcoin and its unique characteristics, and track the catalysts I discussed above. If you become more comfortable and your knowledge expands, then it could be a smart idea to allocate more capital to Bitcoin. Don't forget that it's critical to maintain a long-term mentality."

        "title": "What Is a USB Bitcoin Miner in Crypto, and How Does It Work? - Investopedia",
        "content": "Bitcoin can be purchased using dollars or other currencies, by selling goods or services and receiving payments via bitcoin or by mining. Bitcoin mining is performed using dedicated electronic devices called miners that have high computing capacity. In the early- to mid-2010s, USB connection type mining devices were developed to allow ease of use, seamless connectivity, and lower power consumption at a lower price. But network hashing rates rose too quickly for these devices to keep up, so they were quickly abandoned by users for faster equipment.\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin mining requires a lot of computational power, as your hardware is required to generate trillions of hashes per second.\n\nFor being the first to solve one for the correct hash, you are awarded cryptocurrency.\n\nThese units could be \"stacked\" to achieve greater hashing power, but they still couldn't keep up with the ever-increasing hash rate of the network or ASICs.\n\nHow Do USB Bitcoin Miners Work?\n\nA USB Bitcoin miner, when connected to a computer with suitable software, performs the mining function at a certain hashing speed. To enhance the hashing output, multiple miners could be plugged in together. When they first came out, a stack of six USB miners that offered 335 megahashes per second (MH/s) could generate a cumulative two gigahashes of mining power.\n\nSince a standard computer usually has only two to six USB ports, USB hubs are required to be used to plug in the multiple USB miners. The USB hubs would be connected to a computer with software capable of controlling the USB miners and their mining operations.\n\nInstead of connecting to a standard PC or laptop, the USB Bitcoin miner setup could also be connected to other smaller, low-cost computer devices like Raspberry Pi, which offered suitable capacity to run the miners at the time. However, they were still not fast enough to keep up with other miners.\n\nIn 2023, you can purchase a USB miner that hashes at 220 gigahashes per second. You would need to stack more than 61 of these USB miners (at $198 per unit) to equal the hashing rate of an older Antminer S9 mining at 13.5 terahashes per second (found used on eBay for about $100). And that's only if your USB connection speeds and multiple hubs can handle the amount of information being processed.\n\nHistorical Developments\n\nBitcoin mining started with the standard Central Processing Unit (CPU), an integral part of a standard computer. The mining efficiency was enhanced with the use of comparatively faster Graphic Processing Units (GPUs).\n\nThen came the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which scored better than both CPUs and GPUs at performing the hashing function, an essential element of blockchain management in cryptocurrency.\n\nFPGAs turned the concept of concentrated mining farms into reality and were also the first kind of mining devices that supported USB connectivity. FPGAs are now superseded by Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which consume less power and offer faster processing speeds compared to the former three.\n\nThe rapidly evolving technology has made Bitcoin mining nearly non-profitable on home computers. However, it is possible to use top-of-the-line graphics cards and processors to net a few dollars per month.\n\nCan You Mine Bitcoin With a USB? A USB miner can be used to assist the network, but these devices barely do enough work to earn rewards in a mining pool.\n\nAre USB Bitcoin Miners Worth It? USB Bitcoin miners do not have the computational capacity to effectively mine or even generate any profit as of November 2023, so they are not worth it if you want to mine for income. If you want to participate in the network and learn more about it, they can be a good purchase, albeit an expensive one.\n\nAre Bitcoin Mining Machines Legal? In many jurisdictions, Bitcoin mining machines are legal, but some countries have made it illegal. There are regulations being discussed globally that might eventually put restraints on the practice because it uses energy extensively when the world is attempting to become more aware of energy use and sources.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith lower setup costs, USB miners offered an easy and fun way to learn the nuances of cryptocurrency mining. However, it is currently financially unfeasible to use these devices, as it would take several decades to recoup their cost if a computer could even make the entire setup work.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Demand for Bitcoin could grow by up to 10x within 12 months: Michael Saylor - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "With the Bitcoin halving just months away, MicroStrategy co-founder and Bitcoin (BTC) bull Michael Saylor thinks that demand for BTC could grow by as much as 10x by the end of 2024.\n\nDuring a speech at the 2023 Australia Crypto Convention on Nov. 10, Saylor was asked to give his outlook for Bitcoin and its ecosystem over the next four to five years.\n\nIn response, Saylor initially gave a rundown on the period between 2020 and 2024, noting that Bitcoin went from being seen as an \u201coffshore unregulated asset\u201d to an \u201cinstitutionalized mainstream app.\u201d\n\nHoning in on the near term, Saylor said that BTC will become an \u201cadolescent mainstream asset by the end of 2024,\u201d as he highlighted key dynamics surrounding supply and demand that will soon come into play:\n\n\u201cI think that this next 12 months is going to be big. Because demand [on a monthly basis] should double or triple or maybe go up by a factor of 10, anywhere from two to 10. [...] and the supply available for sale will be cut in half in April.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, instead of a billion dollars of Bitcoin available for miners each month, it will be half a billion. It\u2019s pretty unprecedented that you would go from a supply-and-demand balance of maybe $15 billion of organic demand and $12 billion of organic supply. What happens when one doubles and the other one cuts in half? The price is going to adjust up,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeakers at the Melbourne-based event. Source: Australian Crypto Convention\n\nSaylor went on to describe the next 12 months for Bitcoin as its \u201ccoming out party\u201d as the asset graduates from \u201ccollege\u201d and heads out into the real world.\n\nLooking at 2024\u20132028, Saylor predicted that Bitcoin will continue to be in a high-growth stage as adoption spreads across the big tech industry and mega banks worldwide, with both sectors integrating Bitcoin into their products and services.\n\nSaylor also said he expects to see a lot of competition among companies like Apple and Meta to get their hands on BTC to eventually sell for major profits.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have ferocious competition and will among Wall Streeters to get the most asset share, and you\u2019re going to have crypto exchanges competing, and you\u2019re going to have other tech companies getting involved. [...] That\u2019ll be one check.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other check will be when the big mega banks or Bitcoin custodians with JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, and, you know [...] when they\u2019re making loans and giving mortgages and customizing it and buying and selling it. I think that\u2019ll be the second check,\u201d he added.\n\nLooking even further into the future, at around 25 years down the road, Saylor outlined some lofty predictions for the future of Bitcoin, as he emphasized that BTC will blow any other high-quality asset out of the water.\n\n\u201cWhen it hits that terminal growth rate, maybe 20 years out, maybe 25 years, or it\u2019ll be growing twice as fast or compounding twice as fast as the S&P 500 Index, or any other diversified, high-quality portfolio of assets you could buy,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cSo, if you think about it like that, you just say, well [...] now we\u2019re going to double; we\u2019re going to double again; we\u2019re going to double again; and we\u2019re going to double again, that coin is going to continue to progress to a million dollars a coin, $2 million a coin, $5 million a coin, $10 million a coin.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy currently holds around 158,400 BTC, and the firm was up around $900 million on its investment as of Nov. 2.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions \u2014 Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz has told investors that 2024 will be headlined by institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, which will be driven by the pending approval of Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nDuring Galaxy Digital\u2019s third-quarter earnings call on Nov. 9, Novogratz highlighted the firm\u2019s belief that approving several ETFs \u201cis now not a matter of if but when.\u201d The fund manager filed its spot Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) ETF applications with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in partnership with Invesco in Q3 2023.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin briefly tops $37K amid market optimism for pending spot ETF approvals\n\nInvestors\u2019 sentiment has turned bullish in November 2023, with prominent ETF research analysts predicting the SEC will have approved 12 major Bitcoin spot ETF applications by January 2024.\n\n\u201c2024 literally is going to be a year of institutional adoption, primarily first through the Bitcoin ETF, which will be followed by an Ethereum ETF,\u201d Novogratz said during the Q3 earnings call.\n\n\u201cAs institutions get more comfortable, if the government gives its seal of approval that Bitcoin is a thing, you are going to see the rest of allocators starting to look at things outside of that. And so, money will flow into the space.\u201d\n\nNovogratz added that institutional investment could come to a head in 2025 as investments \u201cin tokenization and wallets\u201d ramp up. The Galaxy Digital CEO added that a key focus for the U.S. landscape should be ensuring that dollar-backed stablecoins remain a central cog in the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to be dollar-dominant. We better have a dollar-backed stablecoin that reflects our values and is taken up around the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Novogratz, a Bitcoin ETF will bring a measure of institutional confidence and a significant amount of funding to the cryptocurrency space.\n\n\u201cThis ETF is giving us all breathing space, putting life in the system. That brings in capital that allows the rest of the stuff to flourish. But I think if you look at the crypto long-term plan, it\u2019s on target,\u201d he added.\n\nThe potential influence of an Ether spot ETF was also brought up during the investor call. Galaxy Digital\u2019s CEO said its possible approval might not be as well received as a Bitcoin ETF, given that Ethereum\u2019s validating model is based on a staking model and staking yields.\n\nRelated: CME overtakes Binance to grab largest share of Bitcoin futures open interest\n\n\u201cUnless they can figure out an ETF that actually passes through the staking rewards, it will be kind of a subpar product from just owning Ethereum with someone like us and having it staked,\u201d Novogratz explained.\n\nHe added that the technical difference would be significant if investors were looking at yields between 4% and 7%, depending on the method of staking. Utility remains an important factor, with Novogratz stressing that different blockchains and their native tokens need to \u201cserve a purpose\u201d and have \u201cstuff built on them\u201d to sustain long-term value.\n\nMagazine: Exclusive: 2 years after John McAfee\u2019s death, widow Janice is broke and needs answers"

It's perfect for facilitating money laundering and illicit transactions. But also, there's the nature of the unregulated domiciles for a lot of this activity where someone can go to basically defraud customers, whether it's NFTs or ICOs or all the various types of digital flimflammery out there \u2013 it's perfect.\"\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs\n\nIn Chanos' view, recent efforts by investing giants to establish the first US bitcoin spot ETFs are another iteration of flimflammery, with the hope of profiting from crypto's high transaction fees.\n\n\"[Retail investors] think the asset price is going to go up. It's like a Nasdaq stock, not a currency. So they'll pay, and Wall Street wants the fees. The cost structure in crypto is quite high and so the fees are really high. You need retail investors because institutions aren't going to be paying 4% per round trip to buy and sell Bitcoin. Mom and Pop are, so Wall Street needs to keep the public interested in the crypto space.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla's biggest challenges\n\n\"When you look at the actual numbers, which is what we do, it's a car company. [Elon Musk's] margins are car company margins, his returns are car company returns. That's the dichotomy: the challenge of running a real global auto company vs. the hype of going to Mars or selling you a robot to do your household chores.\"\n\nChanos also noted that the recent United Auto Workers strike against Tesla competitors didn't benefit the EV-manufacturer, even though it afforded pay increases to union workers.\n\n\"It's interesting, if you actually look at employment cost per vehicle, the good news is that based on the latest UAW contract, the hourly salary or wages per Tesla employee is about half the UAW, but this is the paradox: He has many more employees per vehicle produced than the American companies do. The American companies are actually more automated than Tesla. So the labor cost per vehicle isn't much different.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price of AI\n\n\"Growth in the 10 years prior to the advent of the internet, 1989-1999, was higher than in 1999-2009. While the internet created a lot of businesses and wealth, it also destroyed a lot \u2014 creative destruction. Businesses we took for granted are no longer with us because of the digitization of products. I suspect AI will be similar.\"\n\nChanos offered an example: \"When the AI hype got going in the spring, the IBM CEO said something to the effect of, well, we're looking at all of our employees to see if AI will make any of them redundant. I joked that they better hope their customers don't say the same thing. IBM is consulting! You have to think through all the iterations.\""

        "title": "Nouriel Roubini's crypto secretly wishes it was bitcoin - Blockworks",
        "content": "Oversized crypto critic Nouriel Roubini\u2019s fix for crumbling US dollar hegemony is a cryptocurrency: Atlas, a portfolio safe haven from persistent inflation and fiery global conflict. One that will outperform the US dollar in perpetuity.\n\nBut for all of Atlas\u2019 pomp, Roubini\u2019s pitch can be boiled down to the following: We\u2019ve devised an AI-powered trading bot that will beat the dollar and accelerate green investments.\n\nWhat Atlas proposes is nothing new \u2014 similar projects were popular around the 2017-2018 ICO boom with none seeing long-term success. It\u2019s likely Atlas will be no different.\n\nFunnily enough, on the surface Atlas (full name the Atlas Capital Team Index, or ACT) actually sounds just like bitcoin (BTC), of which Roubini is a staunch skeptic. But in execution, ACT more resembles stablecoin Tether (USDT), which Roubini has previously labeled a massive fraud illicitly pumping crypto prices.\n\nRoubini\u2019s constant crypto negging makes his token project a soft target. But his conversion should hardly surprise: Tether says it\u2019s earning $700 million in profits every quarter due to ballooning yields on its $50-billion-plus stash of Treasurys backing USDT.\n\nWhat\u2019s more frustrating is the way in which Roubini, via Atlas, has adopted the worst habits of crypto marketing so readily.\n\nIn presentation, ACT reminds me of the worst initial coin offerings of cycles past: Inane techno-finance jibber-jabber addled with meaningless buzzwords.\n\nThe project\u2019s website lacks a formal whitepaper, or any real technical details (which blockchain will be used is still a mystery). Its \u201cexecutive summary\u201d is more a collection of lofty promises slotted between bullish charts all pointing to one thing: ACT tokens going up.\n\nRoubini, a grumpy economist who found mainstream fame when his incessant doomposting finally correlated with widespread market meltdown (the 2008 global financial crisis), became notorious in crypto for celebrating price corrections as if they were cataclysmic Black Swan events.\n\nLoading Tweet.. Bitcoin has negative value, according to Roubini\n\nCritics like Roubini often say BTC can never be \u201cdigital gold\u201d \u2014 a precious metal alternative for terminally online millennials \u2014 as it\u2019s not backed by anything physical. Gold can at least be smelted into jewelry, coins or toilets; something intrinsically valuable. Good luck doing that with BTC.\n\nRather, bitcoin is only valuable due to supply and demand \u2014 whether as an investment or a censorship-resistant cash network. Roubini seems certain that demand will dry up any day now, sending the whole industry to zero.\n\n\u201cBitcoin falls more than 40% from its peak in less than one month,\u201d Roubini posted in 2021, as BTC was retreating from record highs. \u201cWhich institutional investors are reckless enough to invest in such a risky and volatile pseudo-asset with no intrinsic value? They should be fired on the spot if undertaking such a reckless speculative gamble!\u201d\n\nRoubini now marketing his own special blend of tokenized speculation is surely ironic, but he probably wouldn\u2019t agree. Atlas, of which he is a co-founder and chief economist, would sell a token at least backed by a basket of real-world assets \u2014 mostly gold, US Treasurys, bonds from Gulf countries and exposure to real estate in regions marginally affected by the climate change Black Swan.\n\nInflation-hedging aside, Atlas\u2019 overall structure really does mirror USDT. Tether fractionalizes exposure to a carefully managed portfolio of real-world assets (like Treasurys and bonds), and sells that exposure to crypto users, one dollar token at a time.\n\nAtlas says it has back-tested its AI-powered strategy and found it \u201cprovided positive annual returns in 48 of the last 51 years, and has consistently outperformed 10-year treasuries, typical 60/40 portfolios, and repeatedly delivered greater returns vs the S&P 500.\u201d\n\nAtlas will also sell tokenized fractional exposure to its own basket of assets, But rather than the US dollar, ACT tokens track an ETF tied to an index of Atlas assets. And Atlas purportedly tweaks its index so masterfully (with the help of machine learning and AI) that it easily outruns inflation and \u201cpreserves the purchasing power of financially vulnerable members of Emerging Market economies.\u201d\n\nAtlas says it \u201cuses machine learning and artificial intelligence to track and measure price performance and volatility of the underlying assets used in Atlas investment products.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing this underlying technology, Atlas can select and allocate assets to offer optimal inflation-protected returns. The proprietary asset management algorithm analyzes market signals and macro data in a systematic and impartial manner to construct resilient portfolios of sovereign bonds, commodities, and REITs that maximize risk-weighted returns.\u201d\n\nSo, where Tether helps those in economies wrought by currency devaluation preserve their wealth by jumping into a dollar-pegged token, Roubini\u2019s Atlas wants to go one step further by breaking them free from the greenback once and for all.\n\n(For what it\u2019s worth, crypto thought leaders including Coinbase\u2019s Brian Armstrong and Balaji Srinivasan have previously opined about the potential for so-called \u201cflatcoins\u201d \u2014 stablecoins pegged to inflation rather than the US dollar \u2014 to one day disrupt USD-linked tokens in much the same way.)\n\nIf only those ravaged by inflation in Turkey or Argentina had bought fractionalized exposure to Roubini\u2019s LLM\n\nHang around crypto fans long enough and Gandhi will appear. \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\u201d If crypto mass adoption were scaled to that quote, Roubini\u2019s participation in Atlas signals victory.\n\nAlthough at this rate, it\u2019s sadly just another opportunity for them to laugh.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.

        "title": "3 theses that will drive Ethereum and Bitcoin in the next bull market - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After 2021, we entered an era in cryptocurrency where people stopped talking only about financial decentralization and started to broadly discuss the tokenization of everything, thanks in part to nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThis shift represents a critical perspective that is set to guide three theses for the upcoming bull market. To fully grasp these theses, it is crucial to understand that everything is data. Money is data. Your engagement with a brand is data. Your credentials are data. The ticket for your favorite show is data.\n\nSince 2021, the ecosystem has increasingly started to store a large part of this data in the form of fungible tokens, NFTs, and timestamps on the blockchain, which acts as a data repository in this context.\n\nRelated: Expect new IRS crypto surveillance to come with a surge in confiscation\n\nWhile not all data needs to be on the blockchain, the ability to place data on the blockchain radically transforms how we store, share, and utilize data for automated and secure instructions and transactions.\n\nAnd it seems that this prospect of tokenizing everything is coming to Bitcoin. This gives rise to the first thesis.\n\nOrdinals and similar protocols continue to grow, while Bitcoin becomes a network for multi-assets (or multiple data types)\n\nIn January 2023, Casey Rodamor publicly released the Ordinals protocol, which, in short, allows for the permanent insertion of any file type into the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn less than a year, the community has already conducted experiments in which music, artwork, journalistic articles, and even video games are being inscribed on the world's leading blockchain.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol was not the first to allow this, but it has gained the most traction. And everything indicates that this is a flame that will not go out.\n\nMore than just a technical protocol, a culture and a mindset have been created where more and more builders see Bitcoin as a canvas for the creation of other projects and applications, and nothing can stop well-established cultural movements.\n\nBut remember: not everything needs to be stored 100% on-chain, as this is expensive and, for some applications, inefficient.\n\nTherefore, protocols such as Taproot Assets \u2014 which enable the creation of other assets \u2014 on the Bitcoin network but in a way that keeps most of the information off-chain, will be essential.\n\nSpeaking of storage costs on layer-1 blockchains, it looks like layer-2 blockchains are set to shine.\n\nCrypto will break out of its bubble and finally reach the everyday person through layer-2 blockchains\n\nThose who were active during the 2021 bull market recall that $50 for a transaction fee on Ethereum was almost the norm, not to mention the spikes, like during the minting of the Otherside NFTs by Yuga Labs, where users paid up to six Ether (ETH) per transaction.\n\nIt's simple: if the blockchain isn't invisible, it won't reach the mainstream. And expensive and slow transactions make the blockchain highly noticeable.\n\nThat's why layer-2 blockchains \u2014 designed to scale layer-1 blockchains \u2014 will be so crucial for the next bull market.\n\nAlthough they've been around for years, neither they nor the market was mature enough to build on them in the last cycle. On one hand, many companies and developers weren't convinced that layer-2s were stable enough to handle a significant influx from the mainstream. On the other hand, there was also the issue that, in the excitement of the moment, people acted without studying and understanding much.\n\nThe number of projects unnecessarily on Ethereum was significant, and the reasons varied: it was cultural, because some companies didn't even know what secondary layers were, or simply because everyone was building on Ethereum.\n\nNow, with all the lessons learned and the calm that has settled in with the bear market, it's clear that the mentality for building is much more mature, and the 'jobs to be done' by blockchains have become much clearer to those who are building.\n\nAnd the cherry on top will be the implementation of EIP-4844, which is expected to happen in a few months on the Ethereum network, and will further reduce the transaction costs of layer-2 networks, making them even more invisible and robust to attract and retain the mainstream audience.\n\nComparison of gas fees before and after EIP-4844. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nBut it's useless for the infrastructure to be invisible if people can't connect to it and companies can't build on it. However, the solution is already here!\n\nAbstraction solutions will be the main gateway and retention mechanism for users and large traditional companies on Web3\n\nThe big issue is that with the tokenization of everything, in some cases decentralization is more of a hindrance than a help.\n\nIf the topic is Bitcoin (BTC) custody, the topic of decentralization is pertinent. However, when the subject shifts to tokenized tickets or a company's loyalty credentials, the value does not lie in the system's decentralization. Therefore, simplifying the user's experience by abstracting complex processes \u2014 such as creating a semi-custodial wallet with social login or eliminating concerns about gas fees \u2014 makes total sense and it's necessary.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin beyond 35K for Christmas? Thank Jerome Powell if it happens\n\nAbstraction solutions were the missing bridge so that the crypto universe does not continue to be a technical environment exclusive to technically skilled people willing to face various challenges and complex journeys. But now, they are ready to shine!\n\nAnd It's not about ending decentralization, it's about having an option. Those who want to remain 100% decentralized can do so, but those who don't now have an option. This way, it avoids the crypto ecosystem dying in the famous chasm of innovation. Because magnificent infrastructures are pointless if people cannot connect to and navigate them easily in everyday life.\n\nThe Technology Adoption Life Cycle highlighting the chasm between early adopters and the mainstream market. Source: \"Crossing The Chasm\" by Geoffrey A. Moore\n\nSomething that's not often discussed is how important these abstraction solutions are for traditional companies to effectively join Web3 too. How many companies currently have a team of developers who can program in blockchain languages, like Solidity? Making it easier for builders to get started is also crucial.\n\nBreaking down the blockchain journey to mainstream into four phases, we could say that the account abstraction solutions, along with the advancements mentioned in thesis two, will propel Web3 into its penultimate phase \u2014 with improved infrastructure, fewer technical builders and brands join the game, and the number of applications, projects, and use cases multiply, attracting mainstream attention.\n\nAs of today, it seems that major blockchains will be increasingly viewed as platforms for multi-asset consensus in the next market cycle and less as currencies. The crowning gem will be the quest for scalability, which will make the layers more invisible and less complex for users to navigate and for businesses to integrate.

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Gold vs. USD: The last 10 years - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the recent years, the financial landscape has transformed with rising demand for Bitcoin. While Gold and the US Dollar have long held their positions as stalwart players, Bitcoin has boldly entered the race, establishing itself as an emerging asset class. Each of these three assets possesses distinct characteristics and potential benefits, creating a dynamic landscape reflecting wealth and investment evolving nature. Let\u2019s delve into the comparative study of Bitcoin, USD , and gold over the past decade.Gold, a trusted store of value for centuries, has been a staple in the financial markets since the 1970s. However, the landscape changed significantly with the introduction of the first gold exchange-traded fund (ETF), Gold Bullion Securities . Launched on March 28, 2003, on the Australian Securities Exchange by ETF Securities and its major stakeholder, Graham Tuckwell, this event marked a significant evolution in gold investment.Historically, gold has demonstrated its resilience by serving as a hedge against inflation amid economic uncertainties. This characteristic has established Gold as a preferred choice for investors looking to safeguard their portfolios. Despite encountering short-term fluctuations, Gold has maintained its reputation as a stable investment, particularly appealing to risk-averse investors. The enduring popularity of Gold as an investment option underscores its time-tested role in providing stability amid the dynamic currents of the financial markets.In contrast, Bitcoin debuted in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. Despite being a relatively young player in the financial arena, it has gained a lot of popularity among investors, garnering usage by approximately 4% of the global population. Over the past few years, Bitcoin has witnessed a surge in retail and institutional interest. The submission of Bitcoin spot ETF applications by major corporations such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale signals a surge in momentum. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape, once characterized by ambiguity, is gradually evolving to accommodate and address the challenges posed by this innovative digital asset.The US dollar has been the world's primary reserve currency since the conclusion of World War II, making it the most widely utilized currency in international trade. The considerable global demand for dollars not only facilitates the United States in borrowing money at a lower cost but also grants the nation leverage in using its currency strategically as a diplomatic tool. However, this advantageous position is not without its drawbacks.As the world's primary reserve currency, the USD has been a lynchpin in global finance for decades, influenced by many factors, including interest rates, economic growth, and geopolitical events. Despite its pivotal role, the USD is not immune to challenges, as it has witnessed periods of inflation and depreciation, threatening its purchasing power over time. This dynamic nature underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the complexities and vulnerabilities associated with the world's leading reserve currency.Gold is renowned for its stability and has historically been considered a safe-haven asset. While the price of Gold can fluctuate, it generally experiences less volatility compared to Bitcoin. Investors often turn to gold as a hedge against market turbulence during economic uncertainty.On the other hand, the US Dollar typically experiences lower volatility than Bitcoin but more than Gold. As discussed above, the stability of the USD is influenced by various global economic factors.When we talk about Bitcoin, in comparison with Gold and USD, it is obvious that it has higher volatility, being a nascent and emerging asset class. Over the past decade, the LBMA Gold Index has had an annualized volatility of almost 14%, roughly one-tenth the annualized volatility of Bitcoin. However, the volatility of Bitcoin is reducing drastically; for instance, over the past year, Bitcoin's volatility was only 49%. This highlights that while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin continue to be riskier investments, the markets are becoming more mature and less risky with time.When considering potential returns, Bitcoin emerges as the clear frontrunner, outpacing Gold and the US Dollar (USD) by a considerable margin. The staggering Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of Bitcoin stands at an impressive 47% over a past 10 year period, showcasing a remarkable performance that dwarfs the growth rates of Gold and USD. To put this into perspective, Bitcoin's CAGR is nearly six times that of Gold and an astounding fifteen times greater than that of USD over the same period.Given its historical performance, investors seeking opportunities for substantial returns may find Bitcoin an attractive prospect. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that higher returns come with higher risks, and the volatility associated with Bitcoin must be carefully considered in the broader context of one's investment strategy and risk tolerance.In evaluating risk-to-reward ratios, particularly using the Sharpe ratio, Bitcoin's performance closely aligns with that of the USD DXY Index, an index reflecting the value of the US Dollar. In this context, it's intriguing that Gold, as a traditional store of value, boasts the highest Sharpe ratio, standing at a notable 0.5 over the past decade. This outpaces both the USD, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.4, and Bitcoin, which registers a ratio of 0.35 during the same period.Gold's elevated Sharpe ratio suggests a favorable balance between risk and return, making it appealing for investors seeking a stable and efficient asset. On the other hand, both the USD and Bitcoin exhibit slightly lower Sharpe ratios, indicating a comparatively lower efficiency in translating risk into returns. This nuanced perspective on risk and reward emphasizes the importance of diversification in investment portfolios.When comparing Bitcoin, Gold, and the US Dollar (USD) over the last decade, their respective liquidity profiles provide essential insights into their market dynamics.Despite its relatively short existence compared to Gold and the USD, Bitcoin has exhibited a remarkable liquidity increase. The growing acceptance of Bitcoin among institutional investors and the development of cryptocurrency exchanges have significantly enhanced its liquidity. This means that larger transactions can be executed with minimal impact on the asset's market price, making Bitcoin increasingly attractive to retail and institutional investors.Historically considered a highly liquid asset, gold maintains its status as a cornerstone in global financial markets. However, its physical nature introduces certain logistical challenges in large-scale transactions. The process of physically transporting and verifying Gold can be time-consuming, impacting its liquidity compared to digital assets like Bitcoin.The US Dollar, the world's primary reserve currency, boasts unparalleled liquidity. It is widely accepted in global trade and is the standard currency for international transactions. The USD's liquidity is further bolstered by its status as the preferred reserve currency for central banks and financial institutions, ensuring it remains highly liquid across various markets.In conclusion, the comparative analysis of Bitcoin, Gold, and the US Dollar over the past decade reveals a nuanced financial landscape shaped by the interplay of tradition, innovation, and economic forces. Each asset brings its unique set of characteristics and challenges to the table.As investors navigate these diverse options, allocating resources between Bitcoin, Gold, and the USD necessitates carefully considering risk tolerance, investment objectives, and the evolving nature of the global financial landscape. Diversification strategies that balance each asset's unique strengths and challenges may provide a resilient approach to wealth management in an ever-changing economic environment.(The author, Mr Edul Patel, is CEO of Mudrex , a Global Crypto Investment Platform)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Bitcoin has more than doubled in value in 2023 after a turbulent ride over the past few years.\n\nHaving reached a record high price of $69,000 in late 2021, the cryptocurrency's value subsequently plunged by over three-quarters in the following 12 months.\n\nBut bitcoin has soared by around 121 per cent to beyond $37,000 in 2023, despite high-profile examples of financial crime in the cryptocurrency world, and concerns about its environmental impact and utility.\n\nTurbulence: Having reached a record high price of $69,000 in late 2021, bitcoin's value plunged the following year. But during 2023, it has more than doubled its price\n\nThere have been four major spikes in the digital currency's value since the year began, with the first happening during mid-to-late January when a group of large investors - known as 'whales' - bought bitcoin in significant quantities.\n\nThat coincided with markets predicting interest rates would start to go down after central banks hiked them continuously the previous year to try and reduce inflation.\n\nBitcoin surged again in March as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank triggered major turmoil throughout the American and European banking systems, with Credit Suisse having to be rescued by rival UBS.\n\nThe uncertainty saw more retail investors decide to plough their money into perceived safer havens, including gold and larger cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBy the end of March, bitcoin had risen to about $28,500, 71 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year.\n\nOver the next three months, the currency enjoyed a couple of mini-bumps before trending downwards, partly due to Chinese regulators banning financial institutions from supporting Bitcoin.\n\nSurging value: Bitcoin has soared by around 121 per cent to beyond $37,000 in 2023\n\nYet it shot up in mid-June when BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nUnlike a future-based ETF, a spot-bitcoin ETF is an investment vehicle that directly owns some bitcoins through which investors have exposure without actually having to hold them.\n\nThe SEC has been reluctant to sanction such funds under the chairmanship of Gary Gensler, partly due to bitcoin's volatility and its widespread use by fraudsters.\n\nBut in October, it decided not to contest a court decision saying the watchdog was wrong to turn down an application by Grayscale Investments to convert its crypto fund into an ETF.\n\nThat set off bitcoin's fourth and final big rally in 2023. It has now climbed by more than a third in the past month.\n\nSoon after the SEC chose not to appeal, BlackRock's iShares ETF turned up on the website of clearing house Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation before being taken down just hours later, then reappearing soon afterwards.\n\nThe BlackRock ETF is one of 12 that the SEC could approve in a 'window' lasting until 17 November, according to Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas.\n\nAhead of this, investors have been putting money into alternative cryptoassets, such as ethereum, BNB and dogecoin, further uplifting Bitcoin's prices.\n\nIf any spot bitcoin ETFs get the thumbs up, this could send bitcoin's price further skyrocketing as pension funds, retail, and institutional investors are more likely to invest in cryptocurrency.\n\nShould none get accepted, Seyffart and Balchunas have said 'there's a 90 per cent chance' of one being approved before 10 January."
