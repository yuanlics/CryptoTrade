        "title": "Will Bitcoin Go Back Up? - NerdWallet",
        "content": "Bitcoin \u2014 and the larger crypto market \u2014 fell in the final months of 2022 following the crash of crypto exchanges FTX and FTX.US. On Nov. 11, 2022, both exchanges filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. And because FTX had invested in so many crypto-related companies and cryptocurrencies, its collapse was felt across the entire industry.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has a history of bouncing back after crashes, recoveries have proven to take months or even years. And although Bitcoin officially recovered all of its post-FTX crash losses by mid-January 2023, it remains a highly volatile asset, and the fallout from the FTX crash is ongoing. Crypto exchange BlockFi, which had received a line of credit from FTX.US and was set to be acquired by it, filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 28. And Gemini is still working to recover assets that were held in its Gemini Earn program, which have been frozen since Nov. 2022.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip If you're worried about keeping your crypto with an exchange, consider moving your digital assets to a separate crypto wallet. Most exchanges allow you to transfer assets to these wallets, which can be online (on a separate platform) or offline (on a thumb drive with added security features).\n\nIn general, what factors could cause Bitcoin to go up?\n\nLooking ahead, there are a handful of factors that could cause demand for crypto to rise:\n\nA crash turns out to be more limited in scope than initially thought. Because so many crypto-related companies are financially entangled through investments and acquisitions, one exchange crash can trigger other companies and currencies to fall like dominoes. If, however, it appears the dust has settled on the FTX collapse, and investors once again pile into the speculative asset, prices could rise. Inversely, if new details emerge regarding the FTX collapse, or if another popular exchange runs into similar issues, that could limit price growth.\n\nLower interest rates. The price of riskier investments tends to rise with lower rates. Currently, the federal funds rate is higher than it's been for more than 10 years and rising as the Federal Reserve tries to beat back inflation. However, when Silicon Valley Bank suddenly collapsed on March 10, 2023, it called into question whether the Fed will continue to raise rates as aggressively as it had been \u2014 or at all.\n\nReduced threats of inflation and economic recession. If the Federal Reserve is successful in reducing inflation through raising interest rates, investors might have more appetite for investing in risky assets such as Bitcoin.\n\nBig investors getting into crypto investing (such as pension funds). Large purchases can nudge prices up.\n\nAdvertisement Charles Schwab Interactive Brokers IBKR Lite Webull NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Because to many Bitcoin enthusiasts, this was exactly the kind of problem Bitcoin was invented to solve. Had SVB depositors put their funds in Bitcoin, the argument went, they would have retained full control of their money. This price surge suggests that when issues within traditional finance arise, there's a cohort of bulls who believe Bitcoin is the solution.

As a result, there's a lot of speculation about where the price will head next.\n\nYou can find a wide range of predictions on crypto blogs, Twitter accounts and YouTube pages. But you won't see many professional analysts setting price targets like they do for stocks. It's just too hard: J.P. Morgan's research from 2021 showed that Bitcoin is roughly five times more volatile than equities or gold and has \"little to no correlation with other major financial assets.\"\n\nThose who believe in cryptocurrency's long-term potential might say the question is not if prices will rise again but when. And \"when\" can mean many different things. For example, Bitcoin could come back as furious as it did in 2021, or it could be a multi-year recovery, such as after a drop in 2013.\n\nIt's also possible that prices could continue to go down rather than back up. The latest crypto winter passed the one-year mark, and a drumbeat of bad news throughout 2022, including the sudden fall of exchanges FTX and FTX.US, dampened hopes of an upswing. Even after a strong start to 2023, uncertainty following the turmoil of late-2022 could send prices downward again.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place Find ways to save more by tracking your income and net worth on NerdWallet.

Buying the dip means viewing price slides as opportunities, if you believe the price will rise again eventually. Tax-loss harvesting is a way to lower your tax bill by selling off investments for a loss, and dollar-cost averaging means buying regular amounts of an investment at regular intervals.\n\nThese strategies for investing in crypto in a down market rely on forming a plan, executing it and sticking with it over time."

        "title": "Is Bitcoin a Safe-Haven Asset Now? Recent Data and Market Experts Say Yes - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC 1.63%) has been a hot topic in the financial world for years, with opinions about the cryptocurrency running the gamut from a \"revolutionary new asset class\" to a \"dangerous speculative bubble.\" One thing that most experts can agree on, however, is that its volatility has historically made it a less-than-ideal safe-haven asset. But recent market movements seemed to have changed that tune. There are fewer sad trombones and more sparkly vibraphone grooves in the Bitcoin canticle nowadays.\n\nBut is the cryptocurrency really ready to serve as a long-term vault for your hard-earned wealth? Let's look closer at Bitcoin's suitability for that august role in light of recent data and expert analyses.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nBitcoin has been on a tear since the beginning of 2023, rising 45% since the start of the year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.19%) index is up by a mere 0.8% over the same period, and gold has gained 2.6%.\n\nZooming out to a three-year view, you'll find that Bitcoin has outperformed the traditional safe havens of gold and broad stock market indexes again. This time, gold is up by 19%. The S&P 500's dividend-adjusted total return stops at 49%. Over the same span, Bitcoin soared 367% higher.\n\nAnd if you allow me to go back six years instead, incorporating the surge of 2017 and the 2018 crypto winter into the data, we can see how a $10,000 investment in Bitcoin has performed against gold and the S&P 500 since the spring of 2017:\n\nOf course, past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, and its value could plummet just as quickly as it has risen. The chart above, impressive as it is, also shows many dramatic price drops over the years.\n\nBut it seems that Bitcoin has finally established itself as a contender in the category of safe-haven assets. As investors seek out alternatives to traditional value stores, like precious metals or diverse stock market indexes, Bitcoin's unique characteristics and limited supply could make it an attractive option for those looking to protect their wealth against inflation and currency fluctuations.\n\nAnd that's right in line with the original intentions of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's unknown inventor (or group of inventors). The cryptocurrency was designed to resist inflation through a lifetime maximum of 21 million digital coins, and 19.3 million of them are already minted. This capped long-term supply is similar to the limited amount of gold on the planet, which is why Bitcoin bulls often refer to it as \"digital gold.\"\n\nExpert analysis\n\nDespite its volatility, some market experts believe that Bitcoin could continue to serve as a safe-haven asset in the future. Beyond the gold-like supply-and-demand equation, some Bitcoin gurus point to the growing interest from institutional investors and large corporations. As a result, the cryptocurrency may be becoming more mainstream and accepted as a legitimate asset class.\n\nIn fact, companies like Tesla (TSLA -4.54%) and Block (SQ 4.91%) have even added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, further signaling their confidence in the cryptocurrency. Taking that idea to its next logical step, business software builder MicroStrategy (MSTR 10.85%) has converted most of its cash reserves into Bitcoin -- and keeps buying more coins financed by a combination of cash flows, loans, and stock sales.\n\ndeVere Group CEO Nigel Green calls the current banking crisis a \"springboard event\" for Bitcoin as traditional-minded investors start to treat the digital asset as a safe port in the storm. The financial shake-up may inspire others to follow in the steps of Tesla, Block, and MicroStrategy. Massive long-term inflation of the U.S. dollar is a critical part of this scenario: \"Investors are therefore looking for alternative currencies, such as cryptocurrencies,\" Green writes in a recent press release. \"Moving forward, these will increasingly compete with traditional, fiat ones, and this will help trigger the decreasing dominance of currently leading international currencies.\"\n\nWhat's next for Bitcoin holders with \"diamond hands\"?\n\nNobody knows for sure where Bitcoin is going next. The crypto winter may be thawing as we speak, or another cold snap could bring Bitcoin prices down again in 2023.\n\nBut I think it's abundantly clear by now that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and that Bitcoin will probably be a reliable store of wealth for many years. MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor may be onto something after all. Truly committed Bitcoin bulls with diamond hands should see stellar results a few years down the road.\n\nThat being said, I still don't want to convert my entire net worth into Bitcoin and take out loans to buy more. Leave that to the professional risk-takers for now. Instead, I'm happy with a modest Bitcoin position that could serve me well in the long run without adding much short-term risk. It's a good place to park cash you won't need for at least a year or two, allowing Bitcoin to get over speed bumps and challenges on the road to sustained wealth. In fact, that's how I think about all investments. Saintly patience is arguably the best quality an investor could have. Just ask Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch."

Bitcoin was last higher by 5% at $22,374.68, according to Coin Metrics data. Ether rose 2% to $1,585.58. The overall cryptocurrency market gained more than $70 billion in the 24 hours to 2 a.m. ET, jumping back above $1 trillion on Monday.\n\nIt has been a rollercoaster ride for crypto markets after the collapse last week of Silvergate Capital, a major lender to the crytpo industry. Silvergate said Wednesday it is winding down operations and liquidating its bank. Then came the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday in what was the biggest banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Both Silvergate and SVB put their money into U.S. Treasurys which have lost value as the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interested rates. These banks have been forced to sell these bonds at a loss to shore up their capital position. That was followed on Sunday by the closure of Signature Bank , a major lender in the crypto industry, by U.S. regulators to stem any contagion to the broader banking sector.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "The Bitcoin blockchain went live on January 3rd, 2009. At its inception, the Bitcoin network started releasing its own eponymous currency or money. Every ten minutes, the network released 50 BTC to a tiny community of cryptography enthusiasts. Although starting from humble beginnings, its creator Satoshi Nakamoto had an ambitious goal for Bitcoin to be a \u201cpeer-to-peer version of electronic cash\u201d for the world.\n\nAt first, Bitcoin didn\u2019t have a set monetary value because there wasn\u2019t a marketplace for BTC. Without goods and services being offered for Bitcoin, it was difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to determine its price in a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar (USD).\n\nMarket Forces Determine Prices\n\nThe cost of goods, fiat exchange rates (USD to EUR for example), and the spot price of commodities (such as corn and oil) are determined by the laws of supply and demand. When in-demand supplies are created in surplus, prices typically go down when demand remains constant. Likewise, a supply shortage tends to make prices appreciate (assuming demand remains constant). This dynamic also holds true for BTC and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Price Markets: Then and Now\n\nOn May 22, 2010, 10,000 BTC were exchanged for two pizzas in what is widely considered the first BTC purchase (at the time, one BTC was worth $0.004). Subsequently, others started accepting goods and services in exchange for Bitcoin which created a market big enough for robust price discovery \u2014 which is simply the free market method for determining an asset\u2019s price. Since then, people have purchased everything from luxury goods to real estate using BTC.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day 2020: How two Papa John's pies became famous\n\nSince 2010, the price has risen dramatically as demand has typically outpaced supply. From July 2020 onwards, the Bitcoin price has remained above $10,000 and reached an all-time high price of $69,990.90 in November 2021. Eschewing BTC-to-pizza markets, price discovery is now determined primarily on centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) where BTC is traded for fiat (USD, EUR, KRW) and a variety of other cryptocurrencies such as ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC).\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Is BTC in Demand?\n\nPut simply, many who purchase and use BTC view it as a fiat currency and payment system alternative. With its limited supply and decentralized nature, some purchase it as an inflation hedge, store of value, or as an investment. Others who have lost confidence in their banking system or national currency prefer an asset that is difficult to confiscate and doesn\u2019t need a trusted third party to make transactions.\n\nBitcoin Price Predictions Vary Widely\n\nFrom being called a \u201cglobal reserve currency\u201d to \u201cabsolutely worthless,\u201d Bitcoin price forecasts vary from zero to over $1 million. Ultimately, the opinions of Bitcoin proponents and detractors won\u2019t determine the price. Like fiat exchange rates and the price of other assets, BTC\u2019s market price is determined by the laws of supply and demand."

        "content": "The jump in risk assets came after U.S. regulators announced plans Sunday night to backstop all the depositors in failed Silicon Valley Bank and make additional funding available for other banks.\n\nBitcoin rose more than 15% to $24,382.98, according to Coin Metrics, and is now about 19% above its Friday levels. Since the January rally in risk assets began to fizzle out, chart analysts have been looking for a meaningful break above $25,000 .\n\nCryptocurrencies surged on Monday, even after regulators Sunday announced the closure of Signature Bank, the last major crypto bank in the U.S.\n\nInvestors were also betting Monday that the Fed will be less aggressive in raising interest rates now that authorities have stepped in to limit the fallout from SVB and Signature.\n\nCrypto initially moved higher amid a broader rally in risk assets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 eventually turned lower and ended the day in the red, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished on an up note, however.\n\n\"A slower hiking pace and a lower terminal rate, plus the likely injection of liquidity to prop up banks struggling to meet withdrawals (through the Bank Term Funding Program) imply greater market liquidity, even if this could be partially offset by higher volatility,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and writer of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter.\n\n\"Bitcoin is one of the most sensitive assets to market liquidity, since its 'risk' profile is unencumbered by earnings or ratings concerns,\" she said.\n\nThe last major crypto bank\n\nThe Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC disclosed in Sunday's joint statement that Signature Bank was closed the same day, in a bid to prevent the spreading banking crisis.\n\n\"Both banks had little diversification,\" Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs, said of Signature and Silicon Valley Bank . \"With high risk often comes high reward, however, if the balance sheet behind the system crashes \u2013 while you have a Fed removing liquidity from the system and hiking rates \u2013 crypto startups and venture capitalists may have a long road to recovery.\"\n\n\"It is a complex matter in the near term,\" she added. \"News of the Fed creating a backstop helped to bolster equities and crypto overnight, however, as panic sets in we will have to see how today's market holds up.\"\n\nCrypto prices rose Monday in the face of that closure, despite it adding to fears by crypto investors and entrepreneurs that regulators are crushing the industry by pressuring banks to cut off their businesses.\n\nSignature Bank was another famously crypto-friendly institution and the next biggest one next to Silvergate , which announced its impending liquidation last week. Wall Street analysts Friday had maintained buy ratings on Signature Bank, even as the bad news around Silvergate and SVB unfolded.\n\nThe end of the Silvergate-Signature duo leaves crypto with few \"on-ramps\" that allow fiat money to flow into crypto assets. They helped solve this problem by creating easy banking services and payment platforms for crypto companies; namely, the Silvergate Exchange Network and Signature's Signet platform."

        "title": "How to create and sell Bitcoin NFTs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have captured the crypto world\u2019s attention fast, opening new opportunities for the oldest blockchain and digital art enthusiasts. Since their explosion in 2020, NFTs have been typically minted and traded on Ethereum-based platforms, besides other blockchains, such as Cardano and Solana.\n\nHowever, a new protocol known as Ordinals was launched in January 2023 by former Bitcoin Core contributor Casey Rodarmor, who exploited the 2021 Bitcoin Taproot upgrade to expand the cryptocurrency capability and enable on-chain Bitcoin-native NFTs.\n\nTaproot offered a way to expand the base layer\u2019s block capability by condensing the size of transactions requiring less data usage and encouraging the use of smart contracts on Bitcoin. The upgrade considerably increases the types of transactions possible on Bitcoin, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications.\n\nBy February 2023, the world\u2019s largest issuer of NFTs, Yuga Labs, had already announced the creation of TwelveFold, a new NFT collection issued on Bitcoin, thereby endorsing Bitcoin NFTs and avouching their success.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Bitcoin NFTs, how they differ from the most popular Ethereum-based alternative, and how to create and sell them.\n\nWhat are Ordinals?\n\nOrdinals are serial numbers imprinted in a single, unique satoshi (sat), the smallest unit of Bitcoin (BTC), through the ordinal theory that assigns them in the order in which they are mined. The first satoshi in the first block has the ordinal number 0, the second has the ordinal number 1, and the last satoshi of the first block has the ordinal number 4,999,999,999.\n\nColored coins were the first representation of such a concept back in 2012, being crypto assets repurposed to represent something of value by adding metadata information. Counterparty is another attempt to embed data into regular Bitcoin transactions. However, it has its own XCP token, required for some functionality, making it officially like an altcoin and not an extension or second layer for Bitcoin.\n\nThe ordinal theory rewards satoshis with numismatic value, allowing them to be collected and traded as rarities. Satoshis are given individual identities to be tracked, transferred and ingrained with meaningful arbitrary data, such as pictures, text or videos, through a Bitcoin transaction that remains permanently part of the blockchain. Such data can be viewed in Ordinals-compatible wallets, such as the Sparrow wallet, and online explorers.\n\nInscriptions\n\nThe process of assigning assets to individual satoshis is called inscription. Inscriptions are digital artifacts native to the Bitcoin blockchain, the digital equivalent of physical artifacts.\n\nThey are fully on-chain, do not require a sidechain or a separate token, and use the Ordinals protocol to inscribe sats with content on ord, an index, an explorer and a wallet that relies on Bitcoin Core for private key management and transaction signing.\n\nOrd allows tracking the location of specific satoshis and their ordinal numbers and can be viewed with the Ordinals explorer. In contrast with traditional NFTs that rely on off-chain content stored on the interplanetary file system (IPFS), inscriptions are gifted with Bitcoin\u2019s immutability and security. They are permissionless and uncensorable digital artifacts since they can be sold without a royalty.\n\nHow to create Bitcoin NFTs\n\nThe Ordinals ecosystem is in full development, but its accessibility is still restricted to two primary ways to mint an ordinal NFT.\n\nThe first method to inscribe Bitcoin Ordinals requires some technical skills, running a full Bitcoin node and then installing Ord on this node to inscribe satoshis into an Ordinals wallet and make Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs. Two types of Bitcoin wallets can process Ordinals; they both must be Taproot-compatible and have a \u201ccoin control\u201d capability to avoid spending Ordinal satoshis as network fees or sending them accidentally in another transaction.\n\nThe Sparrow wallet is only recommended for receiving Ordinals to avoid sending Ordinals sats inadvertently. However, using it does not require running a full node. Here\u2019s how to set up a Sparrow wallet.\n\nAn Ord wallet requires running a full node on 500GB capacity. Unlike the Sparrow wallet, an Ord wallet allows you to create inscriptions and freeze the inscribed sats to prevent accidental spending. Here\u2019s how to set up an Ord wallet.\n\nRegardless of the wallet you\u2019re using, make sure to have some Bitcoin available to pay for the transaction fee.\n\nThe second method is more straightforward and involves using a no-code tool, such as Gamma or Ordinalsbot.com, to inscribe your ordinal NFT. Here\u2019s how to mint your Ordinal on Gamma:\n\nSelect the type of file you\u2019d like to use to mint your Bitcoin NFT.\n\nUpload the necessary file from your computer.\n\nSet up the transaction fee depending on how long you\u2019d like to wait for your Ordinal to be minted.\n\nCopy and paste the Bitcoin address where to send the digital artifact, which needs to be an Ordinal-compatible address or a Taproot address.\n\nWait for the NFT to be minted. Such a wait depends on the fee you paid for the process to be completed and may be hours or even days. You\u2019ll be able to track the minting status through a link you\u2019ll receive by email.\n\nView your minted Ordinal on OrdinalsViewer.\n\nHow to trade Ordinals\n\nWhile proper infrastructure and marketplaces to trade Bitcoin Ordinals are being built, the digital artifacts are traded peer-to-peer over-the-counter (OTC) in dedicated Discord servers, with escrows as intermediaries and tracked on Google sheets.\n\nCompared to the more popular NFTs traded via Ethereum and other blockchains, Bitcoin Ordinals trading appears to be an obsolete method. Yet this hasn\u2019t contained people\u2019s interest in Bitcoin NFTs, with hundreds of thousands of newly minted digital artifacts emerging within only a few weeks from launch.\n\nThe Ordinals market is entirely trustless, using the secure, partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBT) technology, which allows users to easily sign transactions in cold storage, and atomic swaps with no intermediary and a market fee of 2.7%. A system to verify creators is being developed to include creator royalties of 4.2%.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin NFTs\n\nTaproot-compatible wallets must be used to buy Bitcoin Ordinals, such as the Ordinals wallet, the Xverse and Hiro wallets. The Ordinals wallet is very straightforward to use, and the others are also similar:\n\nCreate an account, secure your seed phrase, and deposit funds into the wallet.\n\nSelect the Ordinals you wish to purchase and click \u201cBuy Now.\u201d\n\nOnce the transaction has been executed, the Ordinals will be added to your wallet.\n\nHow to sell Bitcoin NFTs\n\nSimilar to buying a Bitcoin NFT, you\u2019ll need to pick a Bitcoin Taproot-compatible wallet and download it.\n\nCreate an account, secure your seed phrase, and upload your inscription. The fee will depend on the file size and how fast you\u2019d like the transaction completed.\n\nOnce your file has been inscribed onto the blockchain, you can view it on the Ordinals.com inscriptions page.\n\nYou can freeze the Ordinals to make sure you do not spend them.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to use a peer-to-peer OTC market, usually, the Bitcoin Ordinals Discord server, to sell your inscription.\n\nIt is recommended that particular attention is placed on these trades. Being in an unregulated peer-to-peer OTC market, platforms are full of scammers trying to catch the latest Bitcoin NFT craze.\n\nOrdinals vs. traditional NFTs\n\nA few differences distance Ethereum-based traditional NFTs from Bitcoin Ordinals, although they both tend to be grouped under the same umbrella of digital art. The creator of Bitcoin Ordinals, Casey Rodarmor, defines Bitcoin NFTs as authentic digital artifacts because they are on-chain and enjoy all of the good properties Bitcoin holds. Here are the main differences:\n\nBitcoin inscriptions are always immutable, while Ethereum-based NFTs can technically be changed or deleted by the contract owner. Traditional NFTs must be audited to become immutable, which requires deep knowledge of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions always have on-chain content, making it impossible to be lost. It is durable and scarcer because inscription creators must pay fees proportional to the size of the content. In contrast, Ethereum NFT content can be off-chain and stored on platforms such as IPFS and could be lost.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions are more secure because the blockchain is the most secure. Inscriptions can be sold with PSBT without needing a third party, such as an exchange or marketplace, to transfer them on the user\u2019s behalf. On the other hand, Ethereum NFTs tend to grant intermediary platforms unlimited permission over a user\u2019s NFT, and the use of complex smart contracts may be challenging to interact with for the regular non-techie who wants to trade digital art.\n\nUnlike NFTs, which are minted as completely new tokens, Ordinals have the raw file data inscribed directly onto the sats on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin NFTs controversy\n\nThe new Ordinals protocol has raised an important question and sparked a heated debate among the NFT community. Should Bitcoin just be money, or should it expand its functionality to other use cases? Is the Ordinals protocol an attack on the Bitcoin network?\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain has traditionally been used only for payment transactions due to its limited block size and network architecture. Such infrastructure favors solutions built on top of the blockchain as additional layers to increase the network\u2019s programmability and scalability.\n\nThe latest Ordinals craze has raised many eyebrows among the BTC community. Some are concerned it could distract from Bitcoin\u2019s primary use case as a medium of exchange and whether Ordinals make good use of block space. Ordinals can be images, audio clips or even games inevitably requiring space that is subtracted from the financial data, significantly slowing down on-chain confirmation times.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fungibility\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fungibility \u2014 one of the main properties of money \u2014 is also challenged by Ordinals. This is because inscriptions are imprinted in one satoshi, making it a rare unit, just like numismatic coins are rare physical objects used for collections.\n\nOrdinal satoshis become individual identities that can be tracked, transferred and imbued with meaningful information, such as text or an image, making the sat unique and turning it into a de facto NFT. On the other hand, the traditional stance views all satoshis as equal, or they begin to lose a significant trait of money.\n\nFull node costs\n\nA few weeks after the project was launched, a record-breaking-sized block of 4MB was created, raising concerns among the community about the future efficiency and costs of the blockchain and its full nodes. The average size of a Bitcoin block had never exceeded 1.5MB until the launch of Ordinal NFTs.\n\nInscription contrarians fear that increasing the Bitcoin blockchain size due to the big transactions and blocks would raise the requirements and costs for devices running a full node. The counterargument is that for the Bitcoin blockchain to be securer, its blocks must be full, which would justify users paying a higher fee.\n\nThe debate will unfold in the future as the Ordinals market takes a more robust shape and new opportunities arise. Ultimately, Bitcoin\u2019s true spirit and value reside in its resilience to guide the market in the direction the people want."

The exchange, which is fully regulated and has cleared administrative review, will henceforth facilitate cash-settled, daily expiring contracts tied to Bitcoin futures with a \"lower-cost way for investors to trade their views on the up or down price moves of Bitcoin.\" Tim McCourt, global head of equity and FX products at CME Group, commented:\n\n\"Our new event contracts on Bitcoin futures provide a limited-risk, highly transparent way for a wide range of investors to access the Bitcoin market via a fully regulated exchange. These cash-settled, daily expiring contracts will further complement our existing suite which have traded more than 550,000 contracts to-date.\"\n\nOn March 10, Cointelegraph reported that asset manager VanEck's spot Bitcoin trust application was denied by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The commissioners noted that the SEC had denied every application for a spot Bitcoin trust that has been filed, amounting to almost 20 over the last six years.\n\nDays prior, digital currency management firm Grayscale published a transcript related to its ongoing lawsuit with the SEC over the denial of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to be converted into an exchange-traded fund. According to the transcript, Judge Neomi Rao commented:\n\n\"Because it seems to me that these things, one is just essentially a derivative of the other. They move together 99.9% of the time.

The reason for the impulse spike is unknown and was likely due to a \u201cfat finger\u201d trade of a large order.\n\nBTC/USDC hourly price chart on Binance. Source: TradingView\n\nThe potential reason for the flash spike is likely due to thin order books for the newly launched BTC/USDC pair on Binance. The exchange listed the pair only a few hours before the impulse price surge.\n\nAccording to a trader on Crypto Twitter, it is likely that a Bitcoin market order ate through the limit sell-orders on the pair up to $50,000.\n\nThe pair\u2019s trading price returned toward the market spot price of around $22,000 in minutes following the spike, suggesting it was an isolated incident. Fortunately, the futures market remained unaffected by the spot BTC/USDC pair; otherwise, it could have triggered massive short-side liquidations.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time cryptocurrency exchanges have seen flash crashes and spikes. Multiple exchanges in the past had similar issues, inciting anger and refund requests from affected customers.\n\nRelated: Deribit to pay users $1.3M after Bitcoin price \u2018flash crash\u2019 to $7.7K\n\nIn August 2017, a flash crash on GDAX, now called Coinbase Pro, saw Ether (ETH) prices plummet to as low as $0.1 due to a customer error. Ether was trading at around $300 elsewhere at the time.\n\nUSDC stablecoin peg recovers\n\nUSDC\u2019s value dropped to lows of $0.87 on March 11 after Circle, the issuer of USDC, revealed that it had $3.3 billion exposure to the defunct Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).\n\nUSDC trading pairs have been unstable on other exchanges since the SVB revelations. On March 11, the BTC/USDC pair on Kraken spiked to over $26,000 due to fears about the collapse of USDC.\n\nAt the time, USDC was trading at a 10% discount, which would have priced Bitcoin at around $22,200. However, the spike toward $26,000 indicates that panic causes serious volatility.\n\nThe fears amplified over the weekend due to uncertainty around the fate of SVB depositors. In response, the United States Treasury, Federal Reserve, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation decided to bail out the customers of SVB and Signature Bank but not the shareholders and other stakeholders, restoring market confidence for now.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "A solo Bitcoin miner has managed to mine the 780,112th block in the Bitcoin blockchain, receiving a 6.25 Bitcoin (BTC) block reward in return. The estimated value of the payout is over $150,000.\n\nThe solo miner was also lucky to have produced a valid hash after just two days of mining, as the event itself is rare, and it can take months for a solo miner to produce a valid hash.\n\nThe rare event occurred on March 10 and was the 270th solo mined block in Bitcoin\u2019s 13-year-long history. The event is rare because a solo miner of this size usually solves a block, on average, about once every 10 months.\n\nCongratulations to miner39nDQ9BexEBXpRdkHY1z95CaMDEwh6muPW who solved the 270th solo block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc with 6.7PH but doesn't appear to have been mining for very long https://t.co/WGVBC3QajX \u2014 Dr. Con Kolivas (@ckpooldev) March 10, 2023\n\nThe miner created a solo mining pool using the Solo CK Pool mining service, for which they produced a valid block hash and were rewarded with 6.25 BTC, with a fee reward of roughly 0.63 BTC.\n\nCon Kolivas, the Solo CK mining pool admin, noted that the miner behind the rare event might have temporarily rented hashing power to produce the output hash.\n\nSolo Bitcoin miner\u2019s output hash. Source: BTC explorer\n\nBitcoin mining requires miners to input computational power to solve and add the next Bitcoin block to the network. However, with the growing popularity of BTC mining and the constant rise in the network hash rate and powerful mining machines, it\u2019s near impossible for a solo miner to solve the whole block on their own.\n\nRelated: How to mine Bitcoin: A beginners guide to mine BTC\n\nThus, a valid block hash is often produced using the computational power of multiple mining rigs, all trying to mine the next block. The block reward is distributed according to the input hash rate of each miner in the mining pool.\n\nThe Solo CK mining pool has been behind several solo-mined Bitcoin blocks in the past as well. Two of these solo-mined blocks came in January 2022, only two weeks apart, with the first occurring on Jan. 11, 2022, at a block height of 718,124, followed by another on Jan. 24, at a block height of 720,175."

Some may attribute the gains to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s (CPI) 6% year-over-year increase in February, even though the figure was in line with expectations.\n\nThe inflation metric reached its lowest level since September 2021, which is a positive development, but it does not validate the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s attempt to reduce the metric to 2%. Most likely, risk markets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, soared after regional bank stocks recovered from their March 13 lows.\n\nAt 10:30 am Eastern Time, First Republic Bank (FRC) shares were trading 54% higher, followed by Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL) gaining 46% and KeyCorp (KEY) gaining 15%. The 30-year average mortgage rate decreased to 6.6% from 7.1% on March 7. Consequently, reduced mortgage rates have the potential to improve the housing market, which partially explains the rally.\n\nThe unexpected decline in mortgage rates may present an opportunity for price-sensitive homebuyers and homeowners waiting for a chance to lock in a lower rate. According to data from Realtor.com, a buyer of a median-priced home still faced a monthly mortgage payment that was 49% higher than it was one year prior.\n\nDespite the possibility of a recession in the U.S. due to high interest rates, China\u2019s economic outlook remains positive. Li Qiang addressed reporters on March 14 for the first time since assuming the position that oversees the State Council, China\u2019s highest executive body. According to Qiang, non-state-owned enterprises in China will have greater room for development.\n\nLet\u2019s look at derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin margin markets signaling a market deficiency\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because it allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nFor example, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins and buying Bitcoin. On the other hand, borrowers of Bitcoin can only take short bets against the cryptocurrency.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nSince March 13, OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio has been above 35, indicating a significant mismatch in favor of Bitcoin longs. Readings above 40 are uncommon and driven by a high stablecoin borrowing cost of 25% per year.\n\nOne should refer to the BTC option markets to confirm whether professional traders are effectively expecting further price increases.\n\nOptions traders are far from excited\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become less risk-averse. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nThe indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the premium for protective put options is higher than the premium for risk call options.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 8%, and generalized excitement has a negative 8% skew.\n\nRelated: SVB and Silvergate are out, but major banks are still backing crypto firms\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nOn March 13, when Bitcoin broke above the $22,000 resistance level, the BTC options\u2019 main risk gauge exited the fear zone that had been in place for three days. As options traders assigned the same risk assessment to bullish and bearish strategies, the 25% delta skew entered a neutral zone.\n\nHowever, it would be incorrect to conclude that the negative 5% skew seen briefly on March 14 indicates excessive optimism or bullishness. Analysts and pundits frequently jump the gun and celebrate quick reversions, but anything between -8% and +8% remains in the neutral zone.\n\nAccording to the pricing of options contracts, derivatives data indicates that professional traders maintained their long positions using margin markets and exited their bearish stance on March 13. Given the improvement in macroeconomic market conditions, Bitcoin bulls are well-positioned to drive the price above $26,000.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Episode 7 of Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast is now live. This week\u2019s episode features an interview with crypto trader Zoran Kole, who goes by @Captain_Kole1 on Twitter. Kole shared his opinions in response to a number of questions asked by host Benjamin Pirus during the episode\u2019s recording on March 1 \u2014 including his views on what he thinks has most impacted the price of Bitcoin (BTC) so far in 2023 (as of the show\u2019s recording), and whether or not that may remain the case for the remainder of the year.\n\nBitcoin started off 2023 trading between $16,000 and $17,000, according to Cointelegraph\u2019s BTC price index. The asset found itself up near $24,000 toward the end of January and surpassed $25,000 in February. The coin subsequently dropped back down below $20,000 in March, but has since moved up past $26,000.\n\n\u201cThere have been murmurs that Binance is buying up a lot of the Bitcoin using their BUSD,\u201d Kole said. Binance USD (BUSD) is a stablecoin under the Binance brand but issued by Paxos Trust Company, and it faced regulatory uncertainty in February. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has asserted that Paxos wholly owns and oversees BUSD. Kole, however, thinks 2023\u2019s price action so far may be the result of prolonged price suppression and people\u2019s desire to gain back their 2022 losses:\n\n\u201cTo phrase it more simply, in 2023, I think the allure of making it back in one trade is kind of the reason that prices have propelled up since the beginning of the year.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kole doesn\u2019t exactly think that rationale will remain in play for the whole year. He explained:\n\n\u201cI do expect a lot of range-bound behavior to occur. So, all the buyers that were able to buy $15,000, $16,000, $17,000 are probably going to look to distribute somewhere in the upper $20,000s, lower $30,000s. So, I do think we\u2019re going to see quite a bit of chop going into the end of the year.\u201d\n\nKole also answered several other questions during the episode, including giving his thoughts on potential future cycles for BTC.\n\nCheck out this and other episodes from Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast on Cointelegraph\u2019s podcast page, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts or TuneIn.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) begins a new week with a bullish surge above $22,000 as the United States Federal Reserve injects liquidity into the U.S. economy.\n\nIn a move which can rival any classic Bitcoin comeback, BTC/USD is up a full 15% off the two-month lows seen on March 10.\n\nThe volatility \u2014 and temporary relief for bulls \u2014 is due to events in the U.S. after the failure of one bank and the forced shutting of another.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank are the latest victims in a brutal year for financial institutions under the Fed\u2019s rising interest rates \u2014 will the trend continue?\n\nDespite Signature being crypto-focused and a major on-ramp from fiat, crypto markets have so far seen no reason to abandon optimism at the prospect of the Fed providing fresh money.\n\nNot everyone believes this constitutes a \u201cpivot\u201d on interest rate hikes or overall policy.\n\nAs the dust continues to settle and news floods in from the ongoing events, Cointelegraph breaks down the main factors moving BTC\u2019s price in the short term.\n\nFed bails out Silicon Valley Bank depositors\n\nThe story of the moment is, of course, the fallout from Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failing on March 10.\n\nSwallowing hundreds of billions of dollars in deposits, SVB was forced to take a massive $1.8 billion loss thanks to parking consumer funds in mortgage-backed securities, the price of which also suffered during the Fed\u2019s rate hikes.\n\nA snowball effect soon began as depositors became wary that something might be wrong regarding liquidity. Everyone attempted to withdraw from SVB at once, and the funds were unavailable, necessitating the sale of assets at a loss and an emergency funding round which ultimately failed.\n\nThe result has come from the Fed stepping in to backstop depositors\u2019 money. On March 12, it announced the \u201cBank Term Funding Program\u201d (BTFP).\n\n\u201cDepositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13,\u201d an accompanying joint statement from the Department of the Treasury, Fed Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) confirmed.\n\n\u201cNo losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.\u201d\n\n@federalreserve @USTreasury @FDICgov issue statement on actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system, ensuring depositors' savings remain safe: https://t.co/YISeTdFPrO \u2014 Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) March 12, 2023\n\nAs market commentators were quick to point out, the decision effectively marks a return to Fed liquidity injections \u2014 quantitative easing (QE) \u2014 whereas before, liquidity was being withdrawn from the U.S. economy.\n\nRisk assets rallied instantly on the news, as increasing liquidity ultimately increases investor appetite for risk.\n\nCrypto was no exception, despite U.S. authorities announcing the sudden closure of Signature Bank in a move that some argue was a direct attempt to stop crypto markets from capitalizing on the SVB aftermath.\n\n\u201cWe are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank, New York, New York, which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer,\u201d the joint statement read.\n\nReacting to the creation of the BTFP, popular commentator Tedtalksmacro described it as a form of \u201cstealth QE.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnofficial quantitative easing begins on Monday. This is so bullish,\u201d part of subsequent Twitter posts added.\n\n\u201cTL;DR the Fed\u2019s balance sheet will expand and that will increase USD liquidity.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, crypto as a whole is highly sensitive to central bank liquidity trends \u2014 not just those in the United States.\n\nAmong those underlining this is Arthur Hayes, former CEO of derivatives exchange BitMEX, who, in a blog post earlier in the year, described how changing liquidity conditions would likely impact Bitcoin and altcoin performance.\n\nNow, he was conspicuously bullish.\n\n\u201cGet ready for a face ripping rally in risk assets.

If CPI comes in below estimates I don\u2019t see a reason for the market to hold back.\u201d\n\nMore cautious was Alasdair Macleod, who, in light of the BTFP decision, warned against assuming that the Fed had abandoned QT for good.\n\n\u201cInitial market reaction to banking crisis is based on perceived Fed pivot. But this could be a mistake,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of Fed monetary policy, contracting bank credit forces up the price of loans, if you can get one. Monitor money markets!\u201d\n\nAccording to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, overall expectations still favored a further hike rather than a stagnating benchmark rate on March 22. However, 0.5% was off the table.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart.

Discover SCENE\n\nA solo Bitcoin miner was rewarded for adding block 780,112 to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, beating the odds as countless others raced toward the same goal.\n\nThe miner used the Solo CK Pool mining service to establish a solo mining pool, where they produced a valid hash for the block and received a reward of 6.25 BTC and a fee reward of around 0.63 BTC\u2014worth about $148,000\u2014according to BTC.com\u2019s Bitcoin explorer.\n\nA Twitter user pointed out how lucky the solo miner was to produce the valid hash, saying it would typically take a miner much longer to create a valid transaction given the limited computing power they used.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA miner of this size will solve a block on average about once every 10 months,\u201d Twitter user @ckpooldev stated. \u201cThey've only been mining solo for the last 2 days so has been very lucky.\u201d\n\nCongratulations to miner39nDQ9BexEBXpRdkHY1z95CaMDEwh6muPW who solved the 270th solo block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc with 6.7PH but doesn't appear to have been mining for very long https://t.co/WGVBC3QajX \u2014 Dr. Con Kolivas (@ckpooldev) March 10, 2023\n\nThe miner worked with an average hashing power of 6.7 PH/s (petahashes per second), according to @ckpooldev. Around the time that the block was added, Bitcoin\u2019s total hash rate was around 308,262 PH/s, meaning the solo miner\u2019s 6.7 PH/s hash rate represented roughly 0.002% of the blockchain\u2019s entire computational power.\n\nAn account on the Bitcoin forum bitcointalk.org stepped forward to claim responsibility for producing the valid hash, saying he rented extra power for less than a day using a service called nicehash.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is a great luck to catch a block with such a hashrate,\u201d the user titled Pineconeeee stated on the forum. \u201cIn less than a day, luck smiled on me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe solo miner, who said they are from Russia, explained that they typically use a computing power of around 270 TH/s (terahashes per second) but rented 5 PH/s (petahashes per second) worth of power last Thursday, according to his post.\n\nThe block mined by the solo miner contained 3,220 transactions that consisted of around 16,940 worth of Bitcoin volume.\n\nIn order to add a block to a proof-of-work network like Bitcoin, miners continuously run calculations to discover a valid hash for the block, using a process akin to computational brute force.\n\nThese days, a majority of new blocks that are added to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain are mined via mining pools, where miners pool together their computing power to increase their chances of creating a valid hash.\n\nTechnically, it\u2019s possible for a Bitcoin miner to get lucky every now and then and produce a valid hash on their own, despite the competition of other computers racing to calculate a valid hash for the next block on Bitcoin\u2019s network.\n\nAccording to BTC.com, the largest mining pool in the world is currently Foundry USA, a mining pool that comprises around 34% of the total hashrate on Bitcoin's network over the past day. The mining pool\u2019s hashrate is around 107 EH/s (exahashes per second)\u2014around 15,970 times more powerful than the solo miner."

They now make up for 63% of all inscription activity. NFTs such as Bitcoin Punks, Rocks, and Taproot Wizards have been showing huge potential for Bitcoin\u2019s NFT market.\n\nAside from NFTs, other services such as naming systems have also generated interest in the Bitcoin network. The same was evidenced by the popularity of Sats Names, with the latter recording 46,000 new registrations over the last 2 weeks.\n\nDue to all these factors, it is unlikely that new addresses could get a hold of new BTC at lower rates anytime soon. However, there are other indicators that suggest that there may be an incentive for some BTC holders to sell their current holdings.\n\nThe lure of profits\u2026\n\nAccording to Santiment, the MVRV ratio for BTC has hit a new high over the last few days. This suggested that a vast majority of BTC holders could sell their coins for a profit.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nEven though long-term holders may not be as incentivized to sell their holdings, many of the short-term holders that are still active could end up exiting their positions.\n\nThis could drive BTC\u2019s prices down and give new investors an opportunity to buy BTC at an attractive rate."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, responded to the latest drama around the USDC stablecoin by converting the remainder of its $1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds into Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other digital currencies.\n\n\u201cGiven the changes in stablecoins and banks, Binance will convert the remaining of the 1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds from BUSD to native crypto, including BTC, BNB, and ETH,\u201d Binance CEO Chanpeng Zhao wrote in a tweet early Monday.\n\nBinance launched its crypto industry \u201cRecovery Fund\u201d in November 2022 following the collapse of the FTX exchange. The initiative was aimed \u201c to help projects who are otherwise strong but in a liquidity crisis.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven the changes in stable coins and banks, #Binance will convert the remaining of the $1 billion Industry Recovery Initiative funds from BUSD to native crypto, including #BTC, #BNB and ETH. Some fund movements will occur on-chain. Transparency. \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) March 13, 2023\n\nThe move also comes in the wake of Paxos, BUSD's owner and issuer, being hit by a lawsuit from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the agency claiming last month that the firm violated investor protection laws. Paxos announced it would halt BUSD minting and \"end its relationship with Binance,\" for the stablecoin.\n\nIt is not immediately clear how much money from Binance's fund has been converted or is earmarked to be converted into the mentioned coins.\n\nThe ETH address shared by CZ shows some substantial transfers over the past few hours, with the original wallet almost emptied at the time of this writing. Transactions are continuing to be executed at the time of writing.\n\nIt's worth noting that last September Binance began auto-converting USDC deposits into its native BUSD\u2014effectively delisting the rival stablecoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDecrypt reached out to Binance for additional comments but was yet to hear back by press time.\n\nUSDC regains USD peg\n\nFurthermore, Binance's decision comes hot on the heels of the USDC stablecoin depegging from its intended $1 price.\n\nThe depegging event was triggered by the ongoing crisis surrounding the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SBV), where the firm holds about $3.3 billion.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was among the 20 largest banks in the U.S. when it failed Friday after a bank run by customers. California state regulators placed the bank under the control of the FDIC, which in turn created a new entity\u2014the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara\u2014through which the remaining assets will be managed.\n\nUSDC plummeted to an all-time low of $0.87 on Friday night.\n\nThe collapse of SBV, preceded by the meltdown of the Silvergate Bank, also sent shockwaves through the stock market, while the crypto industry saw a depressing drop as well, with Bitcoin crashing below $20,000 for the first time since mid-January.\n\nIn a separate move, the Federal Reserve moved to shut down the Signature Bank on Monday morning, another crypto-friendly bank with total assets of around $117 billion as of the end of last year.\n\nThe scare, at least for now, appears to be short-lived though: according to a joint statement from the Fed, U.S. Treasury, and FDIC on Sunday, all depositors of now-shuttered Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank will be able to get their funds out on Monday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Circle is now out of the woods, which is a huge positive for the crypto world,\u201d Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group, said in a statement shared with Decrypt.\n\nCircle has meanwhile stated that it will \u201ccover any shortfall\u201d caused as a result of the $3.3 billion in its funds held by the collapsed SBV.\n\nThe Boston-based company also reiterated that USDC is 100% collateralized with cash and U.S. Treasuries.\n\nAccording to the firm, \u201cUSDC is currently collateralized 77% ($32.4B) with U.S. Treasury Bills (with a three month or less maturation period), and 23% ($9.7B) with cash held at a variety of institutions, of which SVB is only one.\u201d\n\nThe latest news helped the broader crypto market flip green again, with Bitcoin trading around $22,280 by press time, up 9.1% over the day.\n\nUSDC is changing hands at $0.989, according to CoinGecko."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens continued to move sharply higher on Tuesday amid the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) fallout. However, a few stablecoins lost their pegging to the US dollar amid the crisis but mainstream tokens, particularly, the US dollar were flexing muscles.\n\n\n\nBitcoin advanced another 10 per cent, hitting $24,000-mark. A flight from stablecoins pushed Bitcoin's store of value higher. Its largest peer Ethereum was trading 5 per cent higher and was hovering around $1,700-levels. Altcoins outperformed the blue chips tokens, rallying up to 40 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe closure of three crypto-friendly banks, Silvergate, SVB, and Signature, is likely to result in short-term liquidity issues since these banks acted as the primary ramps for dollars into crypto assets. SVB's transaction halt had caused a sharp 10 per cent de-peg of USDC over the weekend, said Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead at CoinSwitch.\n\n\n\n\"We might see a rapid shift in the usage of new banking partners by the crypto industry. Many in the industry are pivoting to Mercury, BCB Group, Axos, and a few other banks that cater to crypto startups. This could also spark a flight of crypto companies to other more favorable jurisdictions like Switzerland, Hong Kong, Dubai, and the UK,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar pegged stablecoin Tether, all other top and popular crypto tokens were rallying sharply on Tuesday. BNB was up 7 per cent, followed by Litecoin and Polygon, which rallied 4 per cent each. Solana, Dogecoin, Polkadot and Shiba Inu advanced 3 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, regaining the 1 trillion mark. It jumped another 6 per cent to $1.08 trillion in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 24 per cent, close to $90.50 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nThe Graph (GRT) is an indexing protocol for querying data for networks like Ethereum and IPFS, powering many applications in both DeFi and the broader Web3 ecosystem.

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash ranks higher in decentralization than Litecoin and Ethereum Classic.\n\nBCH whales have been reaccumulating during the recent crash.\n\nBitcoin Cash [BCH] has been overshadowed by its more popular counterparts for the major part. Nevertheless, it has managed to retain a sizable following, and it is perhaps the most underrated cryptocurrency as far as decentralization is concerned.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Cash Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin Cash happens to be doing quite well on the decentralization front. A higher hash rate is often considered a good measure of decentralization for PoW networks, and it also translates to higher network security.\n\nBCH\u2019s hash rate has been above the 1 EH/s level for the last three months. Its hash rate at press time was as high as 1.78 EH/S.\n\nFor context, 1 EH/S is a million times more than 1 TH/S. Litecoin\u2019s latest hash rate figure came in at 716.06 TH/S while ETC\u2019s hash rate was 107.13 TH/s at press time.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin Cash outperformed Litecoin and Ethereum Classic in terms of hash rate. Despite these findings, Bitcoin Cash\u2019s hash rate is lower than Bitcoin\u2019s 355.37 EH/S hash rate, hence BTC is still king in that regard.\n\nEven so, Bitcoin Cash does have a higher block size than BTC, and this facilitates a higher TPS. This is why, for some, BCH is a more preferable option as a peer-to-peer payment than Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Cash price action\n\nBCH is still heavily undervalued compared to BTC yet both have a similar circulation and maximum supply.\n\nBitcoin Cash traded at $114.16 at press time, which represented a 25% discount from February highs. Nevertheless, it still showed a bit of an upside from its current weekly low of $105.05.\n\nBCH\u2019s price action reflects movements in the overall crypto market. But is Bitcoin Cash more likely to achieve a sizable bounce back? So far the recent pivot was underpinned by significant whale accumulation.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BCHs worth today?\n\nWhales in the highest address category holding over 1 million BCH have been adding to their balances. The same applies to addresses within the 1,000 to 100,000 BCH category. These addresses increased their holdings since 9 March, hence buying the dip.\n\nDespite the accumulation, addresses within the 100,000 to 1 million BCH category have been contributing to some selling pressure.\n\nThis may explain the limited upside. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s dormant circulation metric indicates that a significant amount of the cryptocurrency exchanged hands during the recent selloff.\n\nOn the other hand, the transaction volume indicated a surge in activity on 9 March. This observation confirmed the influx of buying activity observed when the price bottomed out."

        "content": "Bitcoin on Monday, March 13, seemed to be back on the profit-trail after it managed to reel in profits of nine percent to its recently dipped value. The value of Bitcoin climbed to the mark of $22,245 (roughly Rs. 18.2 lakh) over the weekend, after it had dipped to $19,978 (roughly Rs. 16.3 lakh) on March 10 in the backdrop of the Silvergate Bank shutdown last week. The oldest, most expensive cryptocurrency has shown signs of recovery on national as well as international exchanges.\n\nThe market movement of Bitcoin often sets the course for Ether, the second-most expensive cryptocurrency after BTC. On Monday, ETH rose by 8.24 percent to trade at $1,589 (roughly Rs. 1.30 lakh), as per the crypto price tracker by Gadgets 360. In the last two days, ETH has managed to bag $175 (roughly Rs. 14,330) pricewise.\n\n\u201cMost cryptocurrencies rose in the past 24 hours following a report on the U.S. government planning to protect all Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) depositors. The bank collapsed last week after a $42 billion bank run. The decline of this bank could be attributed to Silvergate's shutdown. The news of Federal Regulators saying all depositors in SVB will have access to all funds has relieved investors and traders to a great extent,\u201d Edul Patel, the CEO-Co-Founder of Mudrex told Gadgets 360, explaining the reason behind the market's resurgence.\n\nMost altcoins rallied with gains following Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nThese include Binance Coin, Cardano, Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot, Tron, and Litecoin.\n\nDogecoin and Shiba Inu \u2014 both the memecoins minted profits as well.\n\nThe valuation of the global crypto market rose by a significant 7.84 percent over the weekend. The market cap, that stood at $930 billion (roughly Rs. 76,39,468 crore) as of Friday last week, presently stands at $1.03 trillion (roughly Rs. 84,07,967 crore).\n\nStablecoins on Monday, did however, show distorted movements. While USD Coin and Ripple recorded profits, Binance USD and Tether settled with losses.\n\nCircuits of Value, Dogefi, and Bitcoin Hedge joined Husky, Nano Dogecoin, and Doge Killer on the loss-side of the crypto charts.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming interest rate hikes by the Fed is expected to be modest after the US labour data for February revealed a slow wage growth. This weakened the value of the US dollar and led to the temporary increase in crypto prices,\u201d Rajagopal Menon, Vice President of India's WazirX crypto exchange told Gadgets 360. \u201cThe rising popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals, which are digital assets inscribed on Satoshis, over the last few weeks may have also contributed to the price increase of BTC.\u201d\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nThe Xiaomi 13 Pro has a hefty price tag compared to the company's 2022 flagship model.

Bitcoin's been clinging to a range between $32,000 and $47,000, which is proving tricky to break out of.\n\nMatt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., has noticed the trend too. \u201cThe long-term players are keeping a bid under the market,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, a lot of people who bought Bitcoin last year are underwater. They seem to be using every bounce as an opportunity to take some chips off the table with so much uncertainty surrounding its ability to become a hedge against inflation.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrencies, like many other risk assets, have lost their luster in recent weeks as global central banks start to lift interest rates and Russia's war on Ukraine stirs all manner of anxiety. Bitcoin, the largest digital asset by market value, has lost 15% since the start of the year and is down roughly 40% since its November record high.\n\nChris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank, says there's one cohort of crypto investors who bought the coin a long time ago, they've seen tremendous gains and they don't trade or sell it.\n\n\u201cThose that bought it cheap and are sitting on big gains are just going to sit on it,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cBut then the traders, if they bought cheap and it's run up, they sell and they keep it within that range.\u201d\n\nCrypto prices have for the most part mirrored moves of the U.S. stock market, where consternation over the war in Ukraine, diminishing growth prospects and skyrocketing commodities prices are blunting sentiment. Investors have pruned many of their riskier bets, including in digital-asset markets, though a long-awaited crypto executive order from the Biden administration was celebrated on Wednesday with a big rally.\n\nBut despite the better-than-expected news around the executive order, \u201ccrypto spot performance overall remains somewhat directionless,\u201d wrote David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase Global Inc. He cites the Ether-Bitcoin crossrate, which has continued to trend lower and \u201cwhich we often use as a risk barometer for crypto assets more broadly,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it seems to be telling us is that risk appetite away from the perceived \u2018safe havens' of the asset class is still somewhat low.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kraken is seeing buying interest from both retail and institutional investors, according to Juthica Chou, head of OTC options trading at the crypto exchange. Some more-active institutional investors might be making opportunistic moves. \u201cThese moves, when you're up 8%, down 8% present a lot of opportunity,\u201d she said on Bloomberg's \u201cQuickTake Stock\u201d broadcast. \u201cOn the other side are some of the institutions that are accumulating over time and are looking at some of these entry points.\u201d\n\nThere's been a lack of catalysts to drive further investments into the space, Chou added. While some investors are coming in now, there's still a lot of global uncertainty so some participants will hold their money in cash until there's a positive catalyst."

        "title": "Have US government, regulators and Federal Reserve just reignited Bitcoin bull market? - CityAM - City A.M.",
        "content": "Have US government, regulators and Federal Reserve just reignited Bitcoin bull market?\n\nThis was never meant to happen. Financial regulators, the US Treasury Secretary, and the US central bank appear to have kick started the next Bitcoin bull market.\n\nOn Sunday night, regulators announced a joint statement from the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chair, Martin Gruenberg that emergency measures were to be rolled out to stem potential contagion from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest US bank.\n\nThe measures include ensuring that depositors with the failed bank would have access to all their money on Monday morning. Banks will also now be permitted to borrow essentially unlimited amounts from the Fed for the next year, in order to stop financial institutions from having to sell those investments that have been losing value because of the Fed\u2019s aggressive interest rate hike agenda.\n\nThese are truly extraordinary actions taken by the authorities as they try to contain the fallout of the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial crash.\n\nBut in what is a masterclass in the law of unintended consequences, these extraordinary actions to help shore-up the traditional banking sector have also been the trigger for a crypto price recovery.\n\nThe crypto market on Friday crashed under $1 trillion, down almost $200 billion since the beginning of March, amid concerns about what the collapse of Silvergate means for the sector and wider macroeconomic issues putting on the pressure. Bitcoin fell below the $20,000 level, shedding almost 10% over the 24-hour period. Meanwhile, Ethereum dropped 9%, and the rest of the top ten echoed the trend.\n\nHowever, just three days after the start of a major bank crisis, crypto prices have rebounded and are almost back where they were at the beginning of last week.\n\nThere are two reasons why the SVB measures seem to have helped to boost crypto prices.\n\nFirst, the SVB rescue package from the Fed is essentially a new form of quantitative easing (QE), the bond-buying programme used by governments around the world to stabilise the financial system after the 2008 crash and later the pandemic.\n\nQE increases the money supply, which reduces the purchasing power of traditional currencies and pushes investors to look for alternative investments such as Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, and becomes more attractive as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.\n\nAnd second, it is now doubtful that the Fed, the world\u2019s de facto central bank, will continue with its plan for aggressive interest rate hikes. The next hike was widely expected on March 22 following robust jobs data in January and February.\n\nWe expect the stress in the banking sector, and the wider impact on confidence, now will give the central bank cause for pause on its rate hike program \u2013 which is bullish for Bitcoin.\n\nLower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which can lead to increased spending and investment, which could lead to increased demand for the world\u2019s largest crypto as investors seek alternative assets with potential for higher returns.\n\nIn addition, as interest rates begin to come down, investors may be less likely to hold onto traditional safe-haven assets like bonds, and instead may look for higher-return investments like stocks or cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor many people, Bitcoin now seems more unstoppable and resilient than ever.\n\nThe banking sector crisis and the emergency measures being implemented by the US government to quell fears of contagion only appear to have fuelled investors\u2019 optimism in crypto as the future of money."

        "content": "After three major banks headquartered in the United States \u2013 Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank (SBV), and Silvergate Bank \u2013 all collapsed within a short period, Robert Kiyosaki warned about government bailouts and recommended buying more Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nSpecifically, Kiyosaki, who is the author of the best-selling personal finance book \u2018Rich Dad Poor Dad,\u2019 made projections that \u201cmore fake money\u201d would \u201cinvade sick economy\u201d as the bailouts begin in response to the major crisis in the finance industry, according to his Twitter post published on March 13.\n\nBAIL OUTS begin. More fake money to invade sick economy. Still recommend same response. Buy more G, S, BC. Take care. Crash landing ahead. \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 13, 2023\n\nAs a reminder, the author had previously heavily criticized fiat currencies, such as the United States dollar, calling it fake money that would contribute to the \u201cend of the American Empire,\u201d and has now again urged everyone to purchase more Bitcoin, gold, and silver as the alternative, as he reiterated his earlier warnings of an upcoming \u201ccrash landing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has ruled out the possibility of a federal government bailout for SVB\u2019s investors, citing the lessons learned and reforms introduced after the previous financial crisis, but she also said that regulators were \u201cconcerned\u201d about depositors and were working to meet their needs.\n\nBleak predictions\n\nIn late January, Kiyosaki warned about a \u201crough landing\u201d for the world, led by the soaring \u201cbad news, bankruptcy, unemployment, homelessness,\u201d and retirement crisis, while simultaneously touting the \u201cgood news\u201d in the form of \u201cbargains everywhere, gold, silver, Bitcoin priceless.\u201d\n\nIn mid-February, he made gloomy predictions of a \u201cgiant crash coming\u201d and warned of a likely \u201cdepression,\u201d as the Federal Reserve was \u201cforced to print billions in fake money,\u201d again praising gold, silver, and Bitcoin as the alternatives, predicting the maiden cryptocurrency could reach the price of $500,000 by 2025.\n\nHe also warned about the starvation and the resulting social unrest that could follow this major financial crash, as well as expressing concern that the rising inflation would \u201cwipe out 50% of the U.S. population,\u201d as Finbold reported back in April 2022.\n\nFeatured image via Ben Shapiro\u2019s YouTube."
