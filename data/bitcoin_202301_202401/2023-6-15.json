All shares in the ETF will be fully backed by BTC and no new shares can be issued without delivery of the corresponding value of tokens.\n\nHowever, the BlackRock offering still requires approval from the SEC, which has so far pushed back against multiple spot-based ETF applications.\n\nThe SEC is currently involved in a court battle with digital asset management firm Grayscale over its plans to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) from a futures-backed index to spot, and may not approve BlackRock\u2019s application until a court ruling is due later this year.\n\nIn its first oral arguments against Grayscale, the SEC cited the \u201cfragmented and unregulated\u201d spot market as the reason for its stance, arguing that the regulated futures market provided more security for investors and pointed to \"surveillance sharing\" agreements that protect against market manipulation.\n\nRegulatory approval for the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be a boost for Coinbase after suffering deposit outflows after a separate legal action from the SEC. The regulator accused the company of operating an \"unlawful exchange.\"\n\nBlackRock shares finished 2.71% higher on Thursday, while Coinbase shares edged up 0.65%.\n\n"

        "content": "In a potential game changer for crypto markets, asset management giant BlackRock is moving to launch an exchange-traded fund for Bitcoin. In an application filed on Thursday, the company sought permission to sell the currency through a vehicle called the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nThe move is significant because of BlackRock\u2019s enormous reach, and because it would allow retail investors to buy Bitcoin as shares of an ETF from an ordinary brokerage account. Likewise, it would make it easier for institutional investors, including pension funds, to hold the asset.\n\nThe ETF application states that Coinbase would be tasked with holding the trust\u2019s underlying Bitcoin as a custodian. It also states that Nasdaq would oversee the pricing data that informed the spot market price\u2014a potentially critical factor since the Securities and Exchange Commission has so far refused to permit a Bitcoin ETF, citing fears of market manipulation.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, which has been slumping in the face of regulatory pressures and hawkish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, jumped around 3% on news of the BlackRock application.\n\nWhile it has become increasingly easy to buy Bitcoin in recent years\u2014with everyone from Coinbase to PayPal to Robinhood offering it\u2014there is still no easy way to obtain it in the form of traditional shares. This has proved an impediment for large institutions, which are subject to bylaws that limit what sort of asset they may hold on behalf of their customers.\n\nCurrently, the most popular option to acquire Bitcoin in the form of shares is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which does not trade on a major stock exchange. The Grayscale trust also charges a management fee of around 2% a year, which is viewed as too high by many investors.\n\nBlackRock is hardly the first to seek to offer Bitcoin as an ETF, where fees are typically well under 0.5%. Grayscale and a number of funds have also sought permission, but have been denied by the SEC.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the BlackRock application, the company believes it will be able to succeed where other applicants have failed, in part because of its pedigree, but also because Nasdaq will be overseeing the pricing data\u2014a situation the person believes will ease concerns about the ETF manager manipulating the asset price on which the ETF is based.\n\nThe SEC last year finally granted permission for a crypto ETF, but only for futures markets\u2014a product that is significantly more complicated than a spot market ETF, and one that is more expensive for investors. Grayscale has sued the agency over this decision, saying it is arbitrary, and based on a recent federal court hearing, analysts have said the company has a good chance to prevail.\n\nThis story was updated with additional details."

        "content": "Asset management giant BlackRock took the first steps Thursday to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which has long been a point of contention between crypto advocates and federal regulators.\n\nThe firm filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust. If approved, the ETF would allow easy access for investors to get exposure to crypto in a product from one of Wall Street's largest companies.\n\n\"The Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in bitcoin rather than by acquiring, holding and trading bitcoin directly on a peer-to-peer or other basis or via a digital asset exchange,\" the filing said.\n\nThe SEC has so far resisted allowing the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The regulator is currently in a legal battle with Grayscale over whether the firm will be allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. A decision in that case is expected later this year.\n\nSeveral other firms have filed and later pulled applications to launch spot bitcoin funds. If the SEC relents, there could be a flood of those products on the market.\n\nETFs typically take months to launch after an initial filing, if they ever begin trading. The proposed BlackRock fund will likely face heavy resistance from the SEC, and the filing could be pulled before an ETF is ever launched, said Aisha Hunt, principal at asset management law firm Kelley Hunt & Charles.\n\nBlackRock's move comes during a time when crypto prices remain well below their all-time highs and the industry faces increasing scrutiny in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe SEC recently sued Coinbase and Binance for allegedly running unregistered securities exchanges. The SEC also accused Binance of commingling customer funds with its own.\n\nCoinbase is listed as the bitcoin custodian for the proposed BlackRock ETF. BlackRock has an existing strategic partnership with Coinbase. The companies announced last year that Aladdin, BlackRock's institutional investment platform, would be connected to Coinbase Prime for crypto trading and custody.\n\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the new filing.\n\nThe entrance of BlackRock into the bitcoin ETF space could be a boost to a sector that has had a rocky start over the past two years.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs first launched in 2021, but the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) is the only one that has grown to a substantial size, with about $800 million in assets. The fund has lost more than 40% on a total return basis since the launch, according to FactSet. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high shortly after BITO launched and is down more than 60% since its peak."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nBlackRock pushed further into cryptocurrencies on Thursday by filing an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nIf the SEC approves the application, the fund would trade on the Nasdaq stock market, making it the first publicly traded spot bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nThe $9tn money manager already runs a private spot bitcoin trust that it launched last year. The ETF marks a further expansion of its partnership with embattled crypto exchange Coinbase, which would be the custodian of the fund\u2019s bitcoin.\n\nThe launch of a spot bitcoin ETF by the world\u2019s largest money manager could be a shot in the arm for cryptocurrencies after a run of bad news including the collapse of FTX last year and the SEC\u2019s decision earlier this month to sue both Coinbase and the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, alleging securities violations.\n\nBut it is not clear that the SEC will approve BlackRock\u2019s application. It has already turned down several earlier proposals from other asset managers on the grounds that the tokens trade on unregulated exchanges with surveillance and manipulation risks.\n\nThe watchdog is being sued by Grayscale over its refusal to allow the conversion of what was then the world\u2019s largest crypto investment vehicle into a listed ETF. The lawsuit contends that the SEC\u2019s decision was arbitrary, particularly because it has allowed the launch of ETFs based on bitcoin futures.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s move also comes at a time when the SEC has proposed new custody rules that would place additional responsibilities on asset managers to make sure that customer assets are kept in properly segregated accounts.\n\nThe price of bitcoin is down more than 60 per cent from its 2021 peak, but it has also bounced significantly from the lows it hit last year after FTX went bust.\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s increasing engagement shows Bitcoin continues to be an asset of interest for some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions,\u201d said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, which provides the bitcoin price that BlackRock plans to use.\n\n\u201cAn estimated 20 per cent of Americans have now owned bitcoin at some point. BlackRock\u2019s proposed ETF potentially offers the other 80 per cent an option that is altogether more familiar and accessible.\u201d\n\nBlackRock declined to comment beyond the filing. But founder Larry Fink, who was once openly sceptical of cryptocurrencies, wrote in his annual letter to investors in March that \u201cvery interesting developments are happening in the digital asset space . . . At BlackRock we continue to explore the digital assets ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAnd during its investor day earlier this week, executives touted the group\u2019s ability to launch new ETFs and offer clients a wide range of asset classes. It currently has more than 1,300 different ETFs."

The U.S. regulator has yet to approve any applications for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nLast year, BlackRock launched a spot bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the United States.\n\nThe move comes at a time when the global cryptocurrency industry has been caught in the crosshairs of the U.S. securities regulator on alleged violations of securities laws.\n\nEarlier this month, the regulator sued major exchanges Coinbase and Binance in high-profile lawsuits that reverberated through the digital assets industry.\n\n\"The fact that BlackRock, a well-respected and established asset management company, has filed for a Bitcoin ETF could be seen as a positive development in the quest for regulatory approval,\" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology group XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.\n\n\"It also shows resilience of the public's interest in crypto.\"\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would track bitcoin's underlying market price. Proponents say an ETF would give investors exposure to bitcoin without directly buying it.\n\nThe SEC rejected Grayscale Investment LLC\u2019s application last year to convert its flagship spot Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nGrayscale sued the SEC, claiming that the regulator was acting arbitrarily in rejecting applications for spot bitcoin ETFs when it had previously approved bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe SEC has also rejected proposals for spot bitcoin ETFs from firms including Fidelity, Cboe Global Markets and NYDIG.\n\nBitcoin prices closed up 2% on Thursday after the announcement. They were last at $25,506 on Friday. The largest cryptocurrency is up 54% in the year.\n\nPlans for BlackRock's ETF were reported by CoinDesk earlier in the day.\n\n(Reporting by Manya Saini and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Ankur Banerjee and Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by Devika Syamnath and Pooja Desai)"

        "content": "Thus far in 2023, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has been one of the top performing cryptocurrencies, up more than 57%. Bitcoin trades for about $26,000 after briefly breaking through the $30,000 price level earlier this year.\n\nBut Bitcoin is still nowhere near its all-time high of $68,789, which it reached in November 2021. Nonetheless, a growing number of analysts, investors, and crypto enthusiasts still think that Bitcoin will break through the $100,000 level sometime in 2024. While that price trajectory might sound outrageous, there are three compelling reasons it might just happen.\n\nBitcoin as digital gold\n\nThe core argument around Bitcoin is that it functions as \"digital gold,\" making it a good store of value, especially amid volatile economic conditions. Thus, during the banking crisis that kicked off earlier this year, investors looking for a safe-haven asset outside of the traditional banking and financial system turned to Bitcoin. And, indeed, the correlation between Bitcoin and gold has increased in 2023.\n\nIf you buy into the argument that Bitcoin is digital gold, then it's possible to make a number of forward-looking price assumptions. For example, noteworthy Bitcoin investor Michael Saylor first calculated the value of the total physical supply of gold in the world (now about $13 trillion) and then proposed a similar valuation for Bitcoin. If you divide the market cap of gold by the maximum number of Bitcoins that will ever be in circulation (21 million), it is possible to come up with a $500,000 price target for Bitcoin. And Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs used roughly the same methodology back in January 2022 to come up with a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional adoption\n\nOK, but what if you got burned by Bitcoin in 2022 and are still skeptical? Gold, after all, does not lose 65% of its value in one year. Fair enough. There's another route to the magical $100,000 price level, and it involves the long-term growth story around institutional adoption. Bitcoin, after all, is more than just a store of value. It is also a form of payment and a potential replacement for various building blocks of the modern financial system, including the U.S. dollar.\n\nNoted investor Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, has analyzed eight different use cases for Bitcoin in the global economic system. For example, Bitcoin is becoming part of the money supply of emerging market nations. And Bitcoin is also accounting for a larger and larger share of cross-border remittances. By taking a closer look at each of these eight areas, and then extrapolating growth rates going forward, Wood came up with a $1.48 million price target for Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nFinally, there's one technical event that could influence the price of Bitcoin, known as the halving. This event occurs only once every four years, and is highly anticipated by the Bitcoin community. In a halving event, the reward paid to Bitcoin miners for mining a new block on the blockchain falls by one-half.\n\nThis might not sound like a big deal (unless you happen to be a Bitcoin miner), but it has tremendous consequences for the supply and demand of Bitcoin. For one, it slows the rate of Bitcoin's supply increase over time. Secondly, it increases the relative scarcity of Bitcoin. Theoretically, the combination of these two factors should help to push up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd, indeed, that is what has happened in three previous halving events. In the last halving, which took place in 2020, Bitcoin's price exploded by 688% and eventually neared its all-time high. Well, guess what? The next Bitcoin halving is scheduled for April 2024, and investors are already putting out aggressive price targets north of $100,000 for Bitcoin. For example, Standard Chartered Bank thinks Bitcoin will hit that figure by the end of 2024.\n\nThe path to $100,000\n\nAs can be seen, there are various paths that Bitcoin can take to reach $100,000. Although the price target might sound absurdly high, especially given the current macroeconomic environment, the potential is certainly there. Of course, there are wildcard factors, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could move to regulate Bitcoin at any moment. And don't forget about the Federal Reserve, which has shown the ability to hammer the price of Bitcoin simply by hiking interest rates.\n\nThat said, I remain bullish on Bitcoin both short-term and long-term. While it is certainly a volatile digital asset, it has a long track record of market-beating performance that dates back nearly a decade. From my perspective, it is no longer a question of if Bitcoin will reach a price of $100,000, but when."

        "content": "The price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped below $25,000 on Wednesday for the first time since March, as the U.S. central bank announced that it would pause increases in interest rates since hiking them up consecutively for more than a year.\n\nThe dip happened dramatically late Wednesday afternoon, according to data from CoinMarketCap, and in roughly an hour, the price of Bitcoin plummeted from approximately $25,868 to about $24,902. As of Thursday morning, the price has stabilized, with one Bitcoin hovering around $24,900, an approximate 4% decline since Wednesday afternoon.\n\nEther, the native cryptocurrency for the Ethereum blockchain and second-largest token by market cap, also dropped from about $1,728 to $1,635, about 5%, per CoinMarketCap. And the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies dropped from about $1.06 trillion to now $1.02 trillion, roughly 4%.\n\n\u201cThe biggest reason for [Bitcoin\u2019s] sudden plunge yesterday was likely the Fed, where, despite pausing, it took a more hawkish tone than expected and indicated that more rate hikes are still on the table,\u201d Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told Fortune. \u201cIn addition, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the market due to the U.S. regulatory posture.\u201d\n\nRudick noted that Ether dropped before Bitcoin and the market downturn was \u201cETH-led.\u201d\n\nThe downswing of the cryptocurrency market mirrored the immediate decline of the major stock indexes after the Federal Reserve announced the pause on rate increases. The S&P 500 immediately dropped about 1%. (It then quickly rebounded before markets closed.) The Nasdaq, which is comparatively dominated by the tech stocks that Bitcoin has been previously said to mirror, also had a brief drop and rebound.\n\nThe decline in Bitcoin\u2019s price reflects how the cryptocurrency tends to react quickly to news of the Fed\u2019s decision to increase, decrease, or hold steady interest rates.\n\nIn May, for example, its price rocketed above $29,000 following the Fed\u2019s announcement that it would continue to raise rates. However, Bitcoin has since fallen more than $4,000, an approximate 14% decrease, as the U.S. government has continued to crack down on crypto, including blockbuster lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, two of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges."

        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nCryptocurrency prices fell after the Federal Reserve's June meeting, with bitcoin falling below $25,000 for the first time since March.\n\nOn Thursday, bitcoin was lower by more than 1% at $25,439.77, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it fell as low as $24,766.52. Ether fell more than 3% to $1,667.56.\n\nAltcoins tumbled too. Solana's token was down 2.3%, Polygon's fell 8.3% and Cardano's lost %3.5.\n\nAnd selling pressure weighed on Tether (USDT), which lost its peg to the U.S. dollar on most exchanges Thursday, falling to 99 cents in its biggest drop since November.\n\nBitcoin cut most of its Thursday morning losses in the afternoon as traders mulled the possibility of the first spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., following a CoinDesk report that BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is close to filing an application for a bitcoin ETF. The report was light on detail, however, and didn't specify how it would get exposure \u2014 whether by tracking spot bitcoin or bitcoin futures.\n\nThe initial slide began late Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve ended its June meeting and decided to leave interest rates unchanged for now, but said two more may be in store by yearend.\n\nFor cryptocurrencies, \"this has little to do with the FOMC, and more to do with thinner liquidity and weak sentiment,\" said Michael Safai, managing partner at Dexterity Capital. \"Given how thin trading volumes are at the moment, a sizable (but not massive) sell order is enough to set off liquidations.\"\n\n\"Traders are more inclined to keep their money off the table in the midst of this regulatory backlash, especially when it comes to altcoins, so there isn't going to be much new capital flowing in to buoy prices so readily,\" he added."

        "title": "Bitcoin as a Hedge for Inflation \u2013 Is It Still a Good Option? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The financial landscape continues to be redefined by the advent of digital currencies, despite the skepticism of some investors. Among these new-age assets, Bitcoin \u2013 the world's leading cryptocurrency \u2013 emerges as an intriguing option for those seeking an inflation hedge.\n\nBitcoin's design, characterized by its fixed supply of 21 million coins, safeguards it from the inflationary pressures that traditional currencies succumb to. By nature, Bitcoin cannot undergo dilution through inflation - a compelling factor that makes it enticing to discerning investors. Moreover, the decentralized architecture of Bitcoin disentangles it from any form of manipulation or control by central banks and governments. This intrinsic freedom lends an additional layer of security to investors wary of government interventions.\n\nHowever, the unique design of Bitcoin doesn't guarantee its viability as an inflation hedge in every circumstance. It's crucial to note that the value of Bitcoin is primarily driven by market demand and supply, with no tangible asset backing it up. Thus, the price can be volatile, experiencing dramatic rises and falls over short periods, even more so than traditional investments. For example, between late 2017 and early 2018, Bitcoin's price swung from nearly $20,000 down to just above $3,000. This level of volatility poses a risk for investors who may need to liquidate their holdings in times of market stress.\n\nWhen using Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, one must also consider its relatively short history compared to traditional investment vehicles like gold. With just over a decade in existence, Bitcoin's performance in a diverse range of economic scenarios is not entirely known. Its behavior during inflationary periods, in particular, remains largely untested. Given that inflation tends to occur over long timeframes, Bitcoin's longevity and stability in such conditions are yet to be fully evaluated.\n\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is another critical factor in assessing Bitcoin's feasibility as an inflation hedge. Despite gaining wider acceptance, cryptocurrencies are still subjected to legal and regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions. There have been instances where governments, including China and India, have restricted or banned the use of cryptocurrencies, impacting their value and liquidity.\n\nThese factors do not undermine Bitcoin's potential but reflect the complexities and risks that come with investing in it. When considering Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, it is advisable to incorporate it as part of a diversified portfolio. By spreading investments across a range of asset types, investors can leverage Bitcoin's potential benefits while mitigating its risks.\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to keep in mind that hedging against inflation is a long-term strategy. Therefore, patience and discipline are key. Although Bitcoin's price may experience dramatic fluctuations in the short term, its overall trajectory since inception suggests a positive trend. Yet, investing in Bitcoin should not be based solely on historical performance, but rather, on thorough research and understanding of the asset and the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has potential as an inflation hedge due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. However, the inherent volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and relatively short historical record compared to traditional hedges add a level of risk. Thus, a careful, well-researched approach and diversification are crucial when considering Bitcoin as part of an inflation-hedging strategy.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. and Nasdaq\u00ae is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.

Numerous issuers have thrown their hat into the same ring, and none succeeded in launching a product. However, given its status in the ETF industry at a global level, if successful, BlackRock has the potential to dominate the space, even if it doesn\u2019t achieve first-to-market status.\n\n\u201cThe SEC has been consistently against spot-based bitcoin ETFs trading. They have concerns about fraud and manipulation. However, if a product were to go to market, it would be a huge success given BlackRock\u2019s industry leadership and connections with advisors,\u201d said VettaFi Head of Research Todd Rosenbluth.\n\nA Long Wait\n\nCertainly, the wait for a physical Bitcoin ETF has been long and tumultuous. More than a decade ago, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed with the SEC to launch the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. It has been a long line of rejections ever since.\n\nFirms like Fidelity, WisdomTree, and VanEck have all seen their applications to launch such a product go nowhere. And Grayscale is currently suing the SEC to be allowed to convert its $15.9 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The firm argues that the fund\u2019s large discount would disappear if it could do so, benefiting its investors.\n\nIn October 2021, ProShares scored a major victory when the SEC approved its ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the first ETF to invest in bitcoin futures. For many investors, that was the next best thing to a physical Bitcoin ETF. The fund quickly accumulated $1 billion in assets under management over the course of a couple of days. That said, nearly two years later, that amount has fallen to $823.2 million. The cryptocurrency currently trades well off the highs that it reached in 2021.\n\nThe SEC has long maintained that cryptocurrencies could be subject to manipulation and that there are not enough protections for investors. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been adamant that those issues must be addressed for the SEC to approve a physical Bitcoin ETF. But BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world and could mount a compelling campaign for approval."

It shows confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s status as a commodity \u2014 rather than a security,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that BlackRock would push forward with an ETF of this nature without serious consultation with regulators and confidence in Bitcoin's future legal status.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s intention to use Coinbase Custody to control funds should also be seen as a massive confidence booster for Coinbase as it prepares its legal defense, Edwards explained.\n\nHe added that BlackRock \u2014 the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2014 likely wouldn\u2019t partner with Coinbase had they not been \u201cconfident\u201d in Coinbase\u2019s legal position.\n\nThe downside\n\nOthers argue that the traditional investment giant's latest moves undermine the \"ethos\" of decentralized cryptocurrencies, or, that the company may find a way to profit from retail investors.\n\nInvestor Scott Melker explained in a June 16 interview that such an approval would be a disservice to crypto-native innovators who built the industry:\n\n\u201cAs good as this may be for institutional adoption of the space, it kind of violates the ethos, it is a bit of a dishonest push away from the people who built the industry in the United States.\u201d\n\nCinneamhain Ventures partner and Ethereum bull Adam Cochran believes that BlackRock will swoop in on the \u201cdiscounted coins\u201d of retail investors, a theory also shared by Melker.\n\nBlackrock ETF\u2026 https://t.co/3g77QNdAun \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) June 15, 2023\n\nSteven Lubka, a managing director at Swan Bitcoin, shared a similar view, predicting that BTC will reach $1 million, but few retail investors would reap the rewards because the bulk of BTC will be owned by BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and other ETF issuers.\n\nMelker added that Wall Street firms will continue to move into the space and that U.S. regulators will likely \u201cchoose them\u201d over incumbent platforms.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: A beginner's guide to exchange-traded funds\n\nARK Invest, Grayscale, Fidelity, Galaxy Digital, VanEck, Valkyrie Investments, NYDIG, SkyBridge and WisdomTree are among the other investment firms that have applied to the SEC for similar Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nSince the news was first reported, the price of BTC has increased 2.2% to $25,584 at the time of writing.\n\nInterestingly, the Fear & Greed Crypto Index increased from 41 to 47 \u2014 leaving the fear zone \u2014 following the news of BlackRock\u2019s filing.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "title": "The Lightning Network: introduction to layer 2 solutions - Santander",
        "content": "A decentralised system to process high volumes of instantaneous micropayments and provides a solution to the scalability problem as it can support millions of transactions per second.\n\nA criticism related to Bitcoin is its inability to execute a high volume of transactions in a short time frame. Given that a block is added to the Bitcoin network every ten minutes and that the block size is limited, Bitcoin is only able to execute 5\u20137 transactions per second, whereas VISA executes more than 20,000 in the same time frame. The Lightning Network however is a solution to this problem.\n\nThe Lightning Network protocol was introduced by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in a paper published in January 2016, and pointed to this protocol as the solution to Bitcoin's scalability problem. The Lightning Network is a Layer 2 communication and payment protocol built on Bitcoin blockchain. In other words, the Lightning Network is a decentralised network for high volumes of instantaneous micropayments, which would allow the user to make immediate transactions with very low fees. The solution allows transactions to be processed off-chain, taking the load off the main network and improving network scalability.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin adds transactions to blocks spaced approximately every ten minutes. Moreover, as blockchain networks gain popularity, the number of transactions is growing exponentially, which means an increase in demand for space in each block, thus driving up transaction costs. This issue of time and cost means that Bitcoin blockchain is essentially unviable for micropayments. Imagine waiting ten minutes at a coffee shop counter to confirm your coffee purchase.\n\nThe Lightning Network resolves these issues. Payments on this network do not require block confirmations and are therefore instantaneous. It also allows payments for small amounts, with much lower fees compared to those using blockchain validation. Another major advantage of this network is its scalability \u2013 as it can support millions of transactions per second. Ultimately, this network eliminates the risk of delegating custody to third parties.\n\nThe Lightning Network works somewhat differently to the blockchain network and operates through payment channels. Parties open a payment channel between each other by sending funds in an initial transaction to a multi-signature address, which is managed by both involved parties and requires the signatures of both these parties to create new transactions. This initial transaction is then propagated to blockchain and the channel is left open. To pay each other, the parties create transactions from the multi-signature address. Once all transactions still pending in the chain have finalised, off-chain transactions can then be performed. When the channel closes, the final balance is recorded in the blockchain.\n\nToday, several companies are at the forefront of Lightning Network development. Blockstream, Lightning Labs and Acinq are just some examples of startups offering their own Lightning Network solution in order to issue their own digital assets through their network and instantly execute cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nNot only are there new companies offering this service \u2013 increasingly more companies, which we could catalogue as traditional, are jumping on the bandwagon to implement their own payment systems. Here are some examples:\n\nShopify, an e-commerce company, has an agreement with Strike to receive payments (via the Lightning Network) in bitcoin, as well as US dollars, from customers around the world. They hope to use this technology to lower fees and streamline international transfers.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (a fast-food franchise) now accepts bitcoin in El Salvador through the Lightning Network. This has all been possible thanks to Stripe's association with Shopify, NCR and Blackhawk. As payments over Lightning Networks continue to grow, it is expected that more and more shops will accept bitcoin (BTC) micropayments.\n\nAt the sovereign level, El Salvador's use of the Lightning Network for remittances was one of the main reasons why the country incorporated Bitcoin as legal tender. Remittances are an important component of El Salvador's GDP, so the country wants to lower costs for receiving such payments.\n\nThis technology, however, has its disadvantages, namely:\n\nPayments can only be made to users who are connected to a payment channel, i.e., the user must be active and connected to the channel. By contrast, traditional cryptocurrency transactions are not affected by this limitation. The Lightning Network is a protocol that is still constantly developing. The fact that even its creators don't recommend using Lightning for transactions involving large sums of money is testament to this. The protocol limits the channel's liquidity for all cryptocurrencies supported by all parties. This is another situation that undermines high-value transactions, as it makes users to have to split their funds in order to have liquidity on normal blockchain and Lightning Networks.\n\nTo summarise, Lightning Networks pose a solution to a problem that not only affects the Bitcoin network (scalability), but also other cryptocurrencies and, what's more, it even has the potential to streamline and reduce costs for fiat-currency payments."

        "title": "Bitcoin in Cuba: Why some Cubans are adopting BTC to escape 'The Matrix' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin adoption could swell in Cuba, particularly if private businesses understand the upside to accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as currency. That\u2019s according to a Cuban businessperson and Bitcoin advocate, Erich Garcia Cruz.\n\nA recent emigrant to the United States, Cruz is a vocal proponent of Bitcoin adoption in Cuba. Cruz leads the remittance and money transfer services BitRemesas and QvaPay, and has been outspoken in supporting Cuban citizens using Bitcoin since 2020.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph as part of an upcoming documentary, Cruz explained that Cubans can use Bitcoin \u201cas a tool.\u201d\n\nPhoto of Erich and Joe during the interview. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nWhile some Cubans use Bitcoin as a store of value, a means of exchange or a remittance tool, ultimately, it\u2019s about getting \u201cout from the Matrix,\u201d he explained. Cruz referred to the country\u2019s centrally planned and officially communist economy.\n\nCuba has no independent press, while the historic United States trade embargo makes it very hard for Cubans to access U.S. products, services and even applications. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is money independent of the state, and has no leader or central party.\n\nCruz explained that during a visit to El Salvador in 2022, one of his friends asked, \u201cHow do you teach about Bitcoin in Cuba if Cuba is run by a communist party?\u201d Surely the party would be against Bitcoin?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the government doesn\u2019t know just how powerful Bitcoin is; they don\u2019t know, and they are just thinking I\u2019m teaching the people about coins in the casino, or if they are afraid of the hyper-Bitcoinization of the Cuban society.\u201d\n\nCruz hints that the government may already understand how Bitcoin works, and maybe, \u201cThey can bypass some sanctions worldwide\u201d using internet-based money.\n\nAdditionally, since 2021, the government has been warming up to cryptocurrencies, as private businesses can legally accept cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin for goods and services. Cruz explains that more and more private companies should accept cryptocurrency instead of the Cuban peso (CUP) or moneda libremente convertible (MLC) \u2014 freely convertible currency:\n\n\u201cIf you get paid with CUP or MLC, you are solving the customer\u2019s problem, but you are creating a problem for you because owners are saying that then or later they will try to convert the CLP or MLC into international currency.\u201d\n\nThe Cuban peso has devalued by more than 800% since its inception. If a Cuban bought Bitcoin at its all-time high of $69,000, they would still have more value in Bitcoin than pesos. Moreover, the MLC is a government-backed stablecoin used for purchases in state-run supermarkets. Cubans looking to save money typically do so in the U.S. dollar and, increasingly, Bitcoin.\n\nMLC price movement as compared to U.S. dollars and euros since 2015.\n\nCruz shares the example of his father, who bought a small amount of Bitcoin with his Cuban peso pension fund three years ago. The pension fund has dramatically lost value as the Cuban peso continues to devalue, while Bitcoin has not only retained but increased in purchasing power:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not financial advice, but it\u2019s better to store your value in Bitcoin than the CUP \u2014 a government-issued shitcoin.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, despite the huge currency devaluation, Bitcoin suffers from a bad reputation in Cuba. Cruz was scammed by a crypto project before learning what Bitcoin is:\n\n\u201cWe have no internet [in Cuba] until five years ago, and Bitcoin is 14 years old. The first contact with Bitcoin in our society was through scams.\u201d\n\nCuba has a highly educated population and university education is free; however, the island is sheltered from Western influences, and the internet is a relatively new tool. The internet, as Cruz points out, only began to penetrate the country in a meaningful way over the past five years.\n\nRelated: Cuba Bitcoin community hosts BTC-only meetup\n\nCruz\u2019s work, and that of the Cuban Bitcoin community, targets private businesses in Cuba, making it an area in which Bitcoin adoption could thrive:\n\n\u201cYou have to teach the people who have the power to embrace that solution. And that\u2019s the private sector. Okay? There is no law. There is no law that forbids the business from accepting Bitcoin. Not yet.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s interview will feature in an upcoming documentary about Bitcoin in Cuba.\n\nMagazine: Peter McCormack\u2019s Real Bedford Football Club puts Bitcoin on the map"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether, top 10 crypto in red, Fed warning of more rate hikes - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell in Thursday morning trading in Asia, dropping below US$25,000 at one stage for the first time since mid-March. Ether also retreated with other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies as trading volumes dipped and the U.S. Fed left interest rates unchanged as expected, but warned of more hikes this year to tackle inflation. Ripple\u2019s XRP token fell despite the release of documents this week that were expected to help the company\u2019s defense in an SEC lawsuit.\n\nCrypto in red\n\nBitcoin fell 2.94% over the last 24 hours to US$25,062.60 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 4.69% in the last week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about US$490 billion, dipped below the US$25,000 support line to as low as US$24,902 earlier in the morning.\n\nEther fell 4.74% to US$1,652.25, posting a 9.70% loss for the week. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nCardano dropped 4.10% to US$0.2624, losing 18.57% of its value in the past seven days. Solana fell 3.18% to US$14.44 and posted a weekly loss of 22.52%.\n\nThe two tokens have been on a downtrend since being named in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit filed last week against the Binance.US and Coinbase exchanges, where the federal agency categorized the two \u2014 along with many other altcoins \u2014 as financial securities.\n\nBenjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport, said the declines are mostly the overhang from the SEC suing Binance and Coinbase.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been predominantly the altcoins that have been dropping,\u201d said Stani. \u201cBTC and, to some extent, ETH as well have been holding up better and that I think is mostly attributable to the fact that the SEC named a lot of [altcoins] as securities and that has this chilling effect.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as expected on Wednesday at 5% to 5.25% after ten consecutive hikes to curb inflation.\n\nBut in another negative for investors, Fed chair Jerome Powell said it may take years to get inflation under control, dousing expectations for rate cuts later this year and raising the likelihood of higher interest rates ahead. Stocks ended mixed.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the losers in the crypto top 10 by market capitalization, falling 7.48% to US$0.4793 on the day for a weekly loss of 7.19%.\n\nThe declines came despite the release of the so-called \u201cHinman documents,\u201d this week, a collection of previously sealed emails and pages from former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman. The notes indicate that Ether should not be categorized as a financial security.\n\nRipple Labs Inc. was sued by the SEC in December 2020 on allegations XRP was sold as an illegal unregistered security. Ripple wanted the Hinman documents made public, arguing they show the SEC itself was sending mixed and confused signals over whether cryptocurrencies were securities and failing to offer clear guidance to the industry, which is part of Ripple\u2019s fair notice defense in the case.\n\nHowever, XRP\u2019s price hasn\u2019t benefited from the release of the documents. Gabriel Shapiro, a U.S.-based attorney and the general counsel at blockchain firm Delphi Labs, wrote on Twitter Tuesday \u2014 \u201c\u200b\u200bHinman emails are a nothingburger though great for Ether. No idea why Ripple thinks these emails help Ripple\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nShapiro added that the documents were not the bombshell compared to the \u201chuge hype\u201d given to them.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap lost 2.76% to US$1.02 trillion in the last 24 hours, and the daily crypto trading volume fell 5.37% to US$31.89 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT on downtrend\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 0.86% to 2,912.74 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.64% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 0.13% to US$23.7 million, while sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, fell 4.78% over the last 24 hours to US$13.52 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nThe Bitcoin network was the second largest NFT network in terms of transactions, rising 6.95% to US$4.1 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe recent buzz in the NFT community is around ERC-6551, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. ERC-6551 is the latest NFT standard for the Ethereum network that went into effect on May 7 this year.\n\n\u201cERC-6551 is introducing a standard for NFTs by unlocking their ability to be a smart wallet that can interact with different decentralized apps in the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cWith ERC-6551, when you transfer an NFT, the wallet and the tokens that the NFT holds also goes with it. Basically wallets within wallets.\u201d\n\nAbout 196 million of Blur tokens worth around US$62 million, 40% of the circulating supply, are being unlocked and distributed to investors and contributors on Wednesday, U.S. time. Blur is the native utility and governance tokens of the Blur NFT marketplace.\n\n\u201c[This] will almost definitely cause a crash in price, which will impact NFT prices,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cBasically, if the token is devalued, will people still want to farm for it via trading NFTs?\u201d\n\nTransactions of Uncategorized Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 topped sales by collection, selling US$3.14 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum-based BoringPunks marked second with US$1.63 million in sales, with over 20,000 transactions in the past day.\n\nU.S. equity futures edge down\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after a mixed regular trading day on Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.09%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.06% lower and Nasdaq Futures lost 0.09%.\n\nThe U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday. The rate is at its highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage last year.\n\nHowever, post-meeting comments from Powell hinted at two more rate hikes by the end of this year, while stating that rate cuts will not happen unless inflation is under control. That didn\u2019t go down well with some business leaders.\n\n\u201cThe battle against inflation is being won. This is now the time for the Fed to stop \u2013 not pause \u2013 interest rate hikes,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\n\u201cThe time lag for monetary policies is notoriously long \u2014 it typically takes about 18 months to two years for the full effect of rate hikes to filter fully into the economy,\u201d Green said, adding that excessive rate hikes could lead to a recession in the U.S.\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 25 to 26.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 30.6% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at July\u2019s meeting, while 69.4% says the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points.\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "title": "Is BlackRock's clout enough to get its bitcoin ETF past the SEC? - Blockworks",
        "content": "Asset management BlackRock has a strong record in getting its products approved.\n\nIssuers seeking to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the US have a terrible one.\n\nSuch a fund has never been permitted, as the SEC has cited fraud and manipulation in the underlying spot market among its concerns.\n\nDavid Hirsch, chief of the SEC enforcement division\u2019s crypto assets and cyber unit, said at a crypto conference Wednesday \u201cthere has not been an adequate system of surveillance\u201d in the spot bitcoin market comparable to trading on a registered exchange.\n\nStill, BlackRock proposed the launch of an iShares Bitcoin Trust Thursday, an ETF that would tap Coinbase as its bitcoin custodian.\n\nThe firm\u2019s decision to seek the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF could signal that BlackRock saw a window for approval, some industry watchers said, while others believe it could simply reflect wishful thinking.\n\nA BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment \u201cdue to regulatory filing restrictions.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas said in a research note that BlackRock\u2019s record for ETF application approvals stands at roughly 575-1. The one denial was for a nontransparent ETF in 2014 \u2014 a controversial structure at the time that, unlike traditional ETFs, don\u2019t disclose their holdings daily.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pessimistic about the potential for a spot bitcoin ETF launch with Gary Gensler at the SEC\u2019s helm, but BlackRock likely didn\u2019t make the decision lightly and is used to working with regulators,\u201d Seyffart and Balchunas wrote.\n\nThe next step after the registration statement is a 19b-4 filing, which would start the approval-seeking process. That filing, which begins a 240-day clock for the SEC to approve the product (or not) could come in the next few weeks, the Bloomberg Intelligence analysts said.\n\nBig name\u2019s involvement a \u2018game-changer\u2019\n\nThe filing comes amid the SEC\u2019s apparent crackdown on the crypto industry.\n\nLast week, the agency took legal action by initiating lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, bringing various charges that included alleged unregistered securities violations.\n\nBut Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, called the filing a potential \u201cgame-changer,\u201d noting there isn\u2019t another asset manager in the world as well-connected to government officials and regulators as BlackRock.\n\n\u201cThe fact that BlackRock is filing now speaks volumes,\u201d Geraci told Blockworks. \u201cBlackRock typically isn\u2019t in the business of making unforced errors, and betting on a spot bitcoin ETF if they weren\u2019t confident in approval seems like an unnecessary gamble.\u201d\n\nProponents of spot bitcoin ETFs have said the SEC allowing crypto investments in a regulated way would protect investors who may try to invest in crypto outside the fund wrapper \u2014 an arena daunting to many, particularly after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.\n\nAccording to a statement from Matt Zhang, the founder and managing partner of crypto investment firm Hivemind, the approval of BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot bitcoin ETF would provide institutional investors with a proper way to get bitcoin exposure through a household name.\n\n\u201cThere is no better combination than BlackRock and Coinbase,\u201d he argued. \u201cThey will give family office investors confidence to use ETFs in crypto.\u201d\n\nRead more: Interest in crypto plummets among family offices, survey says\n\nAn April 2022 survey of 500 financial advisors by Nasdaq found that 72% would be more likely to invest client assets in crypto if a spot bitcoin ETF were offered in the US.\n\nMore recently, a survey in January by Bitwise and VettaFi found that 32% of financial professionals cited \u201clack of easily accessible investment vehicles like ETFs and mutual funds\u201d as a barrier to crypto allocation.\n\nRic Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP), compared the SEC\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF denials to Prohibition, which he said chased people into speakeasies.\n\nDuring his conversation with the SEC\u2019s Hirsch at the DACFP Vision conference in Austin on Wednesday, he said that financial advisers and other investors would welcome the opportunity to access bitcoin exposure through a prominent financial brand, citing Merrill Lynch as an example.\n\nHirsch \u2014 noting he was sharing personal views that weren\u2019t necessarily those of the SEC \u2014 acknowledged there would likely be an upswing in adoption if such a large financial player got involved in the space.\n\n\u201cBut also you\u2019re going to have some people\u2026who were never going to go into a speakeasy, but as long as there\u2019s this brightly-lit pub, say maybe I\u2019ll go in there,\u201d the SEC leader said. \u201cTo the extent that bitcoin is subject to manipulation, you have some additional group of investors who are open to potentially more harm than they otherwise might have experienced.\u201d\n\nMaybe no big deal?\n\nGrayscale Investments launched a suit against the SEC last year for denying its planned conversion of its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. That case is ongoing, and a ruling is expected in the coming months.\n\nThough some said oral arguments in March suggested Grayscale could win the case, certain industry watchers noted a favorable ruling for the firm wouldn\u2019t necessarily open a clear path for spot bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nDave Nadig, financial futurist at VettaFi, said he isn\u2019t reading too much into the BlackRock filing and its timing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing new here, so at best this can be seen as jockeying for position in line on the belief that perhaps Grayscale wins its lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cHistorically, who the issuer is hasn\u2019t mattered all that much on who gets [to be] first on products like this.\u201d\n\nWhile spot bitcoin ETF applications go back a decade \u2014 the first being a 2013 attempt by the Winklevoss twins \u2014 only one other is active.\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares re-filed for their spot bitcoin ETF in April.\n\nSeyffart and Balchunas said BlackRock\u2019s filing Thursday could spur others who had previously tried to launch a bitcoin ETF \u2014 such as Bitwise, VanEck and Fidelity \u2014 to also re-file.\n\n\u201cI still think it\u2019s extraordinarily unlikely that a spot bitcoin ETF is trading in the US in this calendar year,\u201d Nadig said. \u201cAnd probably even in 2024.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies faced renewed pressure Thursday as the industry grappled with new challenges on numerous fronts.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD), the largest digital coin, slipped 4% and fell to its lowest level in the past three months. Other major cryptocurrencies dipped, with ether (ETH-USD) and BNB (BNB-USD) falling more than 5% and a stablecoin called tether going below its crucial $1 price.\n\nThose drops dragged the total market value for all crypto assets to its lowest level since the banking turmoil began in March, according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nPublicly traded crypto companies also fell, including the stock of Coinbase Global (COIN). Other crypto stocks including MicroStrategy (MSTR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Marathon Digital (MARA) sold off as well.\n\nThe new price pressures follow assurances from the Federal Reserve that it isn\u2019t done hiking interest rates this year along with reports that crypto lending platforms Delio and Haru paused withdrawals after facing heightened requests from customers.\n\nRegulators also are turning up the heat on the industry with two new lawsuits filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission last week against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, alleging that 19 specific cryptocurrencies are securities and thus should be registered with the SEC.\n\nThose tokens \u2014 which include BNB, SOL, ADA, and MATIC \u2014 have fallen 10-14% since the lawsuits.\n\n\"Until the regulatory environment is better, cryptos might struggle here,\" Oanda market analyst Edward Moya said Thursday.\n\n'Markets are edgy'\n\nThe multiple pressure points leave the industry with another problem: a lot of sellers and not enough buyers. Major trading firms that once might have acted as market makers have retrenched over the last year.\n\nIn the last week trading volumes have fallen on Coinbase and Binance. Liquidity is also lower on Binance's US-affiliated platform, Binance.US. The amount of money available for trading on Binance's US-affiliated platform fell 75% following last week's SEC charges, according to Kaiko Research.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Everything is coming together all at once and we have thin liquidity in markets now,\" crypto investor and entrepreneur Thomas Dunleavy told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAnother sign of increased stress is the pressure on tether (USDT), the market\u2019s largest dollar-pegged stablecoin by market capitalization and trading volume.\n\nIt fell as much as 0.20% between Wednesday and Thursday, its biggest one-day drop since November.\n\nAs of Thursday at 2:00 AM New York time, the $83 billion stablecoin, which isn\u2019t supposed to fluctuate below its crucial $1 price, fell to $0.9958. It is issued by a company called Tether.\n\n\u201cMarkets are edgy in these days, so it's easy for attackers to capitalize on this general sentiment,\u201d Tether\u2019s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino said over Twitter earlier Thursday.\n\nMarkets are edgy in these days, so it's easy for attackers to capitalize on this general sentiment.\n\nBut at Tether we're ready as always.

        "content": "Payments giant Block announced on Thursday that it will finally give the general public a taste of its Bitcoin self-custody wallet, Bitkey, in an external beta. (The company, headed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, previously conducted an in-house beta open only to Block employees.)\n\nBitkey will partner with Cash App, another Block product, as well as the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase to enable users to transfer Bitcoin directly into customers\u2019 wallets.\n\nUsers will be able to buy crypto from the two platforms when the Bitcoin-only wallet is formally launched outside beta, Lindsey Grossman, the business lead for Bitkey, told Fortune.\n\n\u201cOur strong belief is that self-custody is the best place to hold and manage your Bitcoin,\u201d she said, adding later: \u201cIf anything goes wrong with a custodial platform, you know that\u2014this industry has had a lot of ups and downs\u2014you\u2019re protected.\u201d\n\nThe step forward in the development and eventual launch of Bitkey is part of the payments giant\u2019s larger bet on Bitcoin and Web3.\n\nIn 2018, Dorsey, a Bitcoin evangelist, integrated Bitcoin buying and selling into Cash App. Formerly called Square, the company then said in 2021 that it would rebrand itself as Block, emphasizing its new focus on Bitcoin and blockchain. In 2022, the payments firm unveiled that it was developing a Bitcoin hardware wallet, with a developer sharing images of the device a month later.\n\nOn a video call with Fortune, Grossman briefly flashed the wallet, a flat hexagonal device with a fingerprint scanner that fits into one\u2019s palm. Bitkey\u2019s hardware component is one-third of a \u201cmultisig,\u201d or multisignature, setup.\n\nBlock\u2019s self-custody wallet consists of a mobile app as well as a hardware device. Courtesy of Bitkey\n\nLike multifactor authentication, where platforms like Google ask users to provide a password as well as enter a code sent to their cell phones to access their accounts, multisignature wallets require sign-offs on multiple keys to approve any transaction. To be valid, the majority of keys require sign-offs.\n\nBitkey has three keys. One is on users\u2019 cell phones, another is stored on the hexagonal piece of hardware, and Block holds the final key. To pay for coffee with, say, Bitcoin, a user needs to sign off on the transaction on both their hardware device and cell phone.\n\n(Bitkey allows wallet holders to set a floor for when they\u2019ll need to use their hardware device, Grossman, the business lead, told Fortune. In other words, only with transactions above $100, for example, will users need both their cell phone and the Bitkey device to authorize the payment.)\n\nBlock holds the final key to circumvent the tricky problem with self-custody: As with cash, if users lose their keys, they lose their crypto. (See, for example, the man searching for a key to hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin in a garbage dump.)\n\n\u201cWe are able to help you recover your wallet and recover both your mobile key through a cloud backup and then also help you get a new piece of hardware and create a new hardware key,\u201d Grossman told Fortune.\n\nTo test out Bitkey in the external beta, interested users need to fill out a short application. While Grossman declined to specify in which quarter Block plans to release the wallet, she did say the firm is aiming for later this year."

However, despite repeated applications, the US securities regulator is reluctant to approve any.\n\nHowever, there are a few futures-based Bitcoin ETFs listed on US exchanges.\n\nThe entrance of BlackRock to seek approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF might change the regulatory stance towards the crypto investment vehicle. BlackRock is the largest asset management firm globally and manages more than $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nThe interest of BlackRock in Bitcoin is not new. The company launched a spot Bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the United States last year.

        "title": "Buying Bitcoin is preferable to BTC mining in most circumstances \u2014 Analysis - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "While, intuitively, mining Bitcoin may appear like a highly profitable endeavor, research suggests otherwise.\n\nAfter discovering Bitcoin (BTC), most users go down the rabbit hole and consider whether it is better to mine or buy Bitcoin directly. They usually give up on mining due to the cost and rigor of running ASIC miners, regulatory uncertainty and the lack of technical expertise.\n\nHypothetically, if people overcome the above challenges, they could enjoy advantages such as full autonomy over their operations and diversification of their crypto investment via physical hardware instead of directly purchasing Bitcoin, but the entire venture can be risky and labor intensive.\n\nTo mine, or not to mine BTC?\n\nAn analysis by Bitcoin mining data firm Hashrate Index suggests that \u201cbuying bitcoin is preferable to mining it in most circumstances.\u201d\n\nJaran Mellerud, a Bitcoin mining analyst at Hashrate Index, calculated the projected earnings of miners in the next five years under various bullish and bearish scenarios. Mellerud found that miners will likely incur a loss even in optimistic Bitcoin price projections.\n\nMining is a dynamic business where hardware usually gets outdated within five years due to the introduction of more efficient machines in the market.\n\nFor instance, in the 2016-2017 bull market, the Bitmain S9 models were the most efficient miners. However, as more models entered the market, the S9s were phased out completely by the end of 2022, according to a recent finding by Coin Metrics analyst Karim Helmy.\n\nTwo Bitmain models in the S19j Pro and S19 XP class have dominated the mining sector in 2023. Mellerud calculated the returns assuming that the current batch of miners will be scrapped five years from now, around the 2028 Bitcoin halving.\n\nThe analysis used a constant cost of electricity of $0.07 per kWh and varied the price of Bitcoin and the network\u2019s hash rate to estimate the profit margins of the machines.\n\nIn his report, Mellerud wrote, \u201cHashrate tends to follow the hashprice, albeit with a lag during rapid bitcoin price increases.\u201d\n\nNotably, the electricity cost varies worldwide, and miners can also establish exclusive deals with energy generation companies that lock their costs for months, which may also entail a discount. Figures from a New York Times investigation revealed that Riot Platforms, a public Bitcoin miner, paid around $0.03 per kWh in Texas, while other industries paid around $0.07.\n\nMellerud said, \u201cMining is a no-brainer if you have access to electricity prices below $0.04 per kWh.\u201d\n\nFive-year projections for Bitcoin miner returns\n\nBitcoin miners are profitable only if they can recoup 100% of their capital spent in buying the machines, excluding operational costs. Any additional BTC that hardware brings to its owner is an additional gain.\n\nFor instance, if a Bitcoin-denominated investment of 1 BTC in mining rigs returns 0.9 BTC at the end of five years, buying BTC is preferable to mining.\n\nHashrate Index\u2019s analysts found that miners will return north of 1 BTC only in the most bullish scenarios, where the Bitcoin price goes on to $500,000 per token by 2028 while the network\u2019s hash rate grows 10% slower than its price.\n\nEven in situations where Bitcoin reaches $250,000 by 2028 with a modest increase in its hash rate, the miners would only recoup 83% of the initial cost at best.\n\nReturn on investment from Bitcoin miners denominated in BTC over the next five years. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nRelated: $160K at next halving? Model counts down to new Bitcoin all-time high\n\nWhile Hashrate Index\u2019s analysis relied on future projections, River Financial, a financial services firm specializing in Bitcoin mining research, looked at historical data to find out whether mining was a better option than directly purchasing BTC. River Financial\u2019s analysts found that in the last five years, owning miners was preferred 53.6% of the time.\n\nThe basis of the River Financial analysis is similar to that of Hashrate Index\u2019s report \u2014 miners make a profit if Bitcoin\u2019s price increases faster than the network\u2019s hash rate over time or if the price decreases at a slower rate than the network\u2019s hash rate.\n\nTimes when Bitcoin mining was preferred (in gray) over direct BTC purchases (in white). Source: River Financial\n\nHowever, one caveat of this analysis is that even during times when Bitcoin\u2019s price is rising faster than the hash rate, the miners may still incur a loss due to the actual price being low.\n\nBearish periods have been particularly tough on Bitcoin miners. For instance, the period toward the end of 2022 is marked as preferable, while Bitcoin miners recorded the lowest revenue levels in two years with a significant wave of miner capitulations during that time.\n\nBoth reports appear to agree that mining Bitcoin only makes the most sense right before parabolic bullish periods, with direct Bitcoin purchases being more profitable at all other times.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "There is no way to measure the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that is being sent to self-custody wallets so far, according to one industry executive.\n\nAmid the ongoing fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, over lawsuits against major cryptocurrency exchanges, investors have been increasingly offloading their Bitcoin from crypto trading platforms.\n\nAs of mid-June, Bitcoin\u2019s exchange supply fell to its lowest level since February 2018, according to data from the crypto intelligence platform Santiment. The massive exchange outflows have been triggered by self-custody growth fueled by uncertainty around Binance and Coinbase, Santiment said.\n\nBTC supply on exchanges since June 2017. Source: Santiment\n\nThe growing self-custody trend has a massive impact on cryptocurrency markets, Santiment\u2019s head of marketing Brian Quinlivan told Cointelegraph on June 15.\n\nOne of the most notable results of self-custody is that it tends to decrease circulation, thereby reducing the market capitalization tracked by websites like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.\n\n\u201cCirculation does tend to dry up as coins are moved off of exchanges,\u201d Quinlivan said, adding that the increasing self-custody trend has a downside in the form of stagnant coins.\n\n\u201cThis stagnancy can have a negative impact on market cap due to the lowered utility of the network as a whole,\u201d the exec noted, adding:\n\n\u201cHowever, as long as there is still a healthy amount of exchange activity, which there has been, this generally should be enough to cancel out the negative impact of this current phenomenon.\u201d\n\nQuinlivan stated that coins moving off exchanges have more of a long-term impact on markets. \u201cTraders sometimes assume that if a massive amount of tokens is suddenly moved off exchanges by whales, prices will immediately rise,\u201d he said, adding that the firm has seen that it was usually a much more gradual rise.\n\nThe Santiment executive noted that Bticoin\u2019s supply on exchange has plummeted from 16.1% on Black Thursday in March 2020 to 9.8% today. \u201cPrices are still up 283% during this time span,\u201d Quinlivan added.\n\nWhile the self-custody trend continues to expand, it\u2019s not quite possible to find out how much BTC is sitting on cold wallets, according to Quinlivan. He said:\n\n\u201cAssuming we have every exchange address in existence, which nobody does, then we would be able to measure precisely how much is moving to cold wallets at any given time just by subtracting out all of these known exchange addresses.\u201d\n\nThe executive went on to say that, for now, blockchain analysts can only give their best estimation.\n\n\u201cIt is why our exact number of 9.8% of BTC on exchanges may vary slightly compared to other data out there. The longer time goes on, though, the more accurate data we are able to capture,\u201d Quinlivan noted.\n\nRelated: Binance CEO CZ responds as data points to billions in exchange outflows\n\nThe news comes amid Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization continuing to shrink, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cap since April 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nSince mid-April, Bitcoin\u2019s market value has dropped more than 15%, amounting to $494 billion at the time of writing. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the BTC market cap reached its highest point of $1.28 trillion in November 2021, when the BTC price hit an all-time high of $68,000."

        "content": "Yesterday BlackRock\u2019s iShares filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) after the asset manager unveiled a private Bitcoin Trust in August last year. Numerous spot Bitcoin ETF applications by various asset managers have been rejected by the SEC. The only Bitcoin ETFs that have been approved are linked to the futures markets.\n\nWe believe that BlackRock might have done enough to address the SEC\u2019s concerns about spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBased on previous ETF rejections, the SEC wants to see two things. Firstly, it wants the pricing to be linked to a regulated exchange, which for now would be a futures market. Secondly, it wants the futures exchange (CME) to have a surveillance sharing agreement with the ETF exchange, which is Nasdaq for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThat surveillance agreement must already exist because the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF is listed on Nasdaq and based on CME Bitcoin futures.\n\nSo how can the futures market provide a price for a cash market? If the spot ETF uses the price used to settle futures when they mature. BlackRock plans to use the CF Benchmarks Index, created by a UK FCA-regulated firm. That same benchmark is used by the CME to settle Bitcoin futures.\n\nOther spot Bitcoin ETF rejections\n\nThe crux of the SEC\u2019s objections has related to the perception that cryptocurrency prices are manipulated.\n\nThe second iteration of the Ark/21Shares Bitcoin ETF application was rejected this January, though it\u2019s still trying. Ark\u2019s most recent application analyzed why Bitcoin prices are becoming more reliable.\n\nThe Ark ETF used the S&P Bitcoin Index for pricing which sounds pretty credible. In turn, the S&P index is based on data from the startup Lukka. It uses pricing from a dozen exchanges, including Binance and Bitfinex. Another rejected ETF, the VanEck spot Bitcoin ETF used the MVIS CryptoCompare Bitcoin Benchmark Rate. Both were trying to list on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nIn the case of Grayscale\u2019s failed attempt to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, the pricing index is supplied by TradeBlock. Both Grayscale and TradeBlock are part of the Digital Currency Group.\n\nIn contrast, the CF Benchmarks Index in BlackRock\u2018s application uses half the number of exchanges compared to the S&P index. Those exchanges are Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, ItBit (Paxos), Kraken and LMAX.\n\nMeanwhile, the BlackRock ETF will use Coinbase Custody as custodian, and Coinbase as prime broker, extending its existing relationship with the crypto exchange. The question is whether Coinbase\u2019s role could hold up the ETF given the SEC is suing the exchange."

The trust tracks the performance of bitcoin, offering direct exposure to the price of the digital currency, according to the asset manager.\n\nCoinbase Custody will be used by BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust as its custodian, according to a filing with the SEC \u2013 building upon an already existing relationship between the two firms.\n\nIn August last year, BlackRock expanded its crypto offering through a partnership with Coinbase. The two firms created new access points for institutional crypto adoption through the connection of their Coinbase Prime and Aladdin platforms.\n\nIf the SEC was to approve BlackRock\u2019s filing, the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF by a large asset manager could help rebuild confidence in digital assets, which has been deflated by news including the collapse of FTX last year.\n\nRead more: Wild West in action: FTX\u2019s fall from grace\n\nIt is still unclear whether the SEC will approve BlackRock\u2019s filing. However, given that earlier this month, the regulator sued Coinbase alleging securities violations \u2013 as well as previous rejections for similar filings from other asset managers such as Grayscale \u2013 the SEC might exercise reluctance once again."

Source: TradingView.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin had been holding around the $26,000 region as the market came to grips with the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s legal action against crypto exchange heavyweights Coinbase and Binance, as well as increasing macroeconomic uncertainty around interest rate signals from the United States Federal Reserve.\n\nThe sharp drop in price arrived roughly three hours after the Federal Reserve announced a pause on interest rate hikes following a 15-month-long campaign of rate increases to combat surging inflation.\n\nWhile the market was almost unanimously expecting a rate pause, the Federal Open Markets Committee statement hinted at further rate hikes in the future, which typically blunts investor excitement for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to eToro market analyst Josh Gilbert, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has made it quite clear that this is only a temporary pause, something that could spell further trouble for Bitcoin in the long term.\n\n\"Much of the positivity we\u2019ve seen from risk assets this year, including Bitcoin, is built on the expectation that inflation will fall and interest rates will peak, and then begin to be cut,\" Gilbert said.\n\n\"Inflation is moving in the right direction but the comments from Jerome Powell signify that rates could stay higher for longer, which would put Bitcoin on the back foot.\"\n\nRelated: SEC, CPI and a \u2018strong rebound\u2019 \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nThe second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ether (ETH), also took a hit, falling more than 5% from $1,727 to $1,631 in the same time frame.

Hashrate is the computing power required for confirming and legitimizing Bitcoin transactions over the blockchain.\n\nBinance is currently selling 1 Terahash per second (Th/s) at $10.7280, which is split between the hashrate and electricity costs at $1.17 and $9.558 respectively.

For each TH/s purchased, users will be able to earn 0.0004338 BTC during the timeline.\n\nAs the product is launched on Binance\u2019s global website, the service is not available for crypto investors residing in the United States.

        "title": "Bitcoin edges up after slump, Ether little-changed, other top 10 tokens mixed - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Friday morning trading in Asia, after falling below US$25,000 overnight and overall posting a losing week, a trend mirrored by Ether. The rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed after finding little impetus from the U.S. Fed decision in the week to leave interest rates unchanged. Polygon\u2019s Matic token had the biggest decline in the top 10 amid sharp falls in altcoins since the U.S. regulator last week labeled many of them illegally issued financial securities.\n\nBumpy week\n\nBitcoin added 2.05% over the last 24 hours to US$25,573.56 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 3.83% in the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about US$497 billion, slipped to US$24,797.17 at around 8:00 p.m. on Thursday, the lowest since March 16.\n\nEther traded little changed at US$1,665.73, up a slight 0.78%, but posting a weekly loss of 10.06%.\n\nSolana led gains among the top 10 tokens by market capitalization, rising 3% to US$14.88, but still down 21.58% for the past seven days. The Solana community on Twitter is throwing around the idea of a hard fork to avoid further scrutiny from U.S. regulators, but such an idea is not being discussed among Solana developers, according to Decrypt.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic was the biggest loser out of the top 10, dropping 4.06% to US$0.5952 to bring the week\u2019s loss to 24.06%.\n\nMost of the top 10 have been on a roller-coaster ride since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance.US and Coinbase in the week of June 5. The SEC also named dozens of altcoins as financial securities, including Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB.\n\nThose four tokens combined had a market capitalization of US$57.5 billion as of Friday morning in Asia, which is a sharp 26.5% slump from the US$78.27 billion prior to the SEC\u2019s lawsuits.\n\n\u201cMany notable altcoins, such as Matic, were listed as securities in recent SEC lawsuits, so venture capital firms have been selling their altcoin holdings to capture the little liquidity left and lessen the blow to their portfolios,\u201d said Nick Ruck, the chief operating officer of blockchain venture studio ContentFi Lab, in a Telegram message to Forkast.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are managing portfolio risk and preparing for a continued downtrend amid less market liquidity and tighter regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nIn related moves, U.S.-based trading platform Robinhood delisted Cardano, Polygon and Solana, while the eToro platform halted user purchases of Polygon, Decentraland, Algorand and Dash \u2014 which were all named in the SEC\u2019s legal filings.\n\nThe crypto market seemed to find little relief in the move this week by the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases.\n\n\u201cThis pause, or skip seems to be a more tactical move, but the fight against inflation is not over yet,\u201d said Michiel Janssen, trader and analyst at crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, in an email statement shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cFor crypto this means in the short term that there is less money flowing into the crypto markets. In the longer run, higher inflation and further problems in the banking sector can be a positive for crypto.\u201d\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap increased 1.21% to US$1.04 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 18.55% to US$37.82 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cGrails\u201d sales hit US$17 million\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 1.39% to 2,884.87 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.46% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions fell 25.96% to US$18.58 million. Transaction on Ethereum, the leading NFT blockchain, dropped 10.50% to US$13.2 million.\n\nTransactions on the Bitcoin network, the second largest NFT blockchain, plunged 72.91% to US$1.12 million.\n\nOn Thursday, global auction house Sotheby\u2019s finished its second round of sales of NFTs from the \u201cGrails\u201d collection. \u201cGrails\u201d consists of non-fungible token (NFT) artwork that belongs to the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and its NFT-purchasing fund Starry Night Capital.\n\nSingapore-based Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that once managed as much as US$10 billion, filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in July 2022, which protects assets of insolvent foreign debtors from U.S. creditors.\n\nIn February this year, Three Arrows Capital\u2019s U.S.-based liquidator Teneo said that it plans to sell NFTs owned by the company with an estimated value of US$22 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe second auction brought in nearly US$11 million in sales, including Dmitri Cherniak\u2019s \u201cThe Goose\u201d or Ringers #879, which was sold for US$6.2 million alone. The collection has raised a running total of US$17 million in Sotheby\u2019s sales.\n\n\u201cWhile the NFT community is excited by today\u2019s major art sales from the Sotheby\u2019s auction, that isn\u2019t money that will flow back into NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cThese were seized NFTs from 3AC and that money will go to recouping losses.\u201d\n\nIn other transactions, the NFT staple Bored Ape Yacht Club topped sales by collection, selling US$1.11 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nMythos chain-powered DMarket game NFTs came second with US$899,694 in sales, with over 51,000 transactions in the past day.\n\nU.S. stock futures drop after Thursday rally\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after rallying during the regular trading day on Thursday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.15%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.21% lower and Nasdaq Futures lost 0.33%.\n\nThe Dow rose 1.26% on Thursday, S&P gained 1.22% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.15% as optimism grew that the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes are near the peak, according to Trading Economics.\n\nThe U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday. The rate is at its highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage last year. The central bank warned of two more rate hikes by the end of 2023.\n\nThe European Central Bank raised its interest rates for the eighth consecutive time on Thursday, adding 25 basis points.\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 25 to 26.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at July\u2019s meeting, while 71.9% says the Fed will raise by 25 basis points.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is copying the prelude to its 2020 breakout to an \u201cinsane\u201d extent, the co-founders of Glassnode have said.\n\nIn a tweet on June 15, Yann Allemann and Jan Happel highlighted three BTC price metrics that are anything but bearish.\n\nMetrics echo Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cmajor reversals and rallies\u201d\n\nBTC/USD reached local highs of $31,000 in April but, since then, has dipped around 20%. Sentiment has taken a beating in the process, with downward price predictions becoming the norm in the intervening weeks.\n\nWhile recent events have placed additional pressure on the market, Allemann and Happel see at least three good reasons for optimism.\n\nSeveral on-chain indicators, they revealed, now look uncannily like they did in Q3 2020, just before BTC/USD beat its old 2017 all-time high of $20,000.\n\n\u201cThe resemblance to Sep 04, 2020, is insane\u2026,\u201d they wrote in part of commentary.\n\nLeading the line-up is the classic relative strength index (RSI), which measures how overbought or oversold BTC/USD is at a specific price point.\n\nDaily RSI currently measures 35, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirms. This is its lowest reading since early March, just before Bitcoin\u2019s most recent uptick, which resulted in the $31,000 peak a month later.\n\n\u201cRSI is at levels that led to major reversals and rallies,\u201d the post explained.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart on Bitstamp with RSI. Source: TradingView\n\nContinuing, Allemann and Happel flagged the Cipher B readings for Bitcoin, these coming from a collection of algorithms that converge to offer signals of, among other things, when to buy dips during bull markets.\n\n\u201cCipher b wave trends are at levels that led to major reversals and rallies,\u201d they repeated.\n\nFinally, the appropriately named Bitcoin Risk Signal is back at its Sept. 4, 2020 position. Risk Signal predicts the likelihood of a major BTC price drawdown and, at that time, saw a spike to \u201chigh risk\u201d before receding.\n\nWhat happened next was a flat Risk Signal reading for successive months, while BTC/USD broke higher.\n\nBitcoin Risk Signal chart. Source: Glassnode\n\nHodlers big and small increase BTC exposure\n\nElsewhere, Glassnode flagged encouraging signs suggesting investors keeping the faith long term.\n\nRelated: \u2018Pick your targets\u2019 \u2014 Bitcoin analyst believes Fed will favor bulls\n\nFor lead on-chain analyst Checkmate, accumulation among existing hodlers remained impressive.\n\n\u201cPretty doomy out there,\u201d he tweeted about sentiment on June 15."

        "content": "Bitcoin traded below US$25,000 on Thursday afternoon in Asia for the first time since March 17 this year, when it stood at US$24,973. Ether, alongside all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, also dropped amid lawsuits by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against two of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. As widely expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday. However, the Fed warned of more rate rises to come later in the year as the central bank attempts to bring inflation down to its 2% target level.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong? Singapore? Tokyo? Seoul? Dubai? The race is on for the Web3 hub of Asia | Part 1\n\nBitcoin continues slide; SEC-targeted coins drop\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dropped 3.82% to US$24,909 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong. That brought its weekly losses to 5.80%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The dip took Bitcoin below US$25,000 for the first time in the week since the U.S. SEC filed lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase.\n\nEther, the second biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, lost 6.10% to US$1,635 in 24 hours, and has dropped 11.24% on the week. Ether dropped below US$1,700 on Thursday afternoon in Asia for the first time since March 17 when it stood at US$1,667.13.\n\nSolana, Cardano and Polygon \u2013 the top three cryptocurrencies named as securities by the U.S. SEC in its lawsuits against both Binance.US and Coinbase \u2013 each dropped more than 20% over the past week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA token lost 5.76% to US$0.2561 in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization was also down 7.10% in the last 24 hours to US$8.88 billion. On June 5 \u2014 the day the SEC filed a legal complaint against Binance.US claiming crypto tokens including ADA, Solana and Polygon\u2019s Matic are securities requiring registration and regulation \u2014 that figure stood at US$13.02 billion.\n\nSolana dropped 1.87% in the past 24 hours to US$14.78. Its market cap declined 2.75% to US$5.88 billion in the same period, down from US$8.15 billion on June 5.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic token also dived 4.94% to US$0.6151 in the past 24 hours. Its market cap lost 5.92% to US$5.70 billion in that period, down from US$8.01 billion on June 5.\n\n\u201cThe status of individual cryptocurrencies has led some exchanges in specific markets to contemplate delisting some of the larger and widely followed altcoins such as ADA, SOL, and MATIC,\u201d said Robert Quartly-Janeiro, Chief Strategy Officer of crypto exchange Bitrue, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cWhat sets the current situation apart is the regulatory focus shifting from market-providing exchanges to scrutinizing individual altcoins: that\u2019s a step change. In raw numbers, the affected coins have experienced bearish performances, with Cardano dropping by 24%, Solana down by 28%, and Polygon shedding 27% in the past week. Other altcoins witnessed similar declines,\u201d Quartly-Janeiro added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token led the losers in the crypto top 10. It fell 6.45% in 24 hours to US$0.4697, posting a weekly loss of 9.87%.\n\nThose losses came despite the release of the so-called \u201cHinman documents\u201d this week. The documents suggests that cryptocurrencies liker Ether are not in fact securities, as claimed by the SEC. Its release was therefore widely expected to prove favorable for Ripple in its own ongoing legal battle with the regulator, which began December 2020.\n\nBNB, the native token of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance \u2014 whose U.S. operations are now the target of the SEC\u2019s regulatory clampdown \u2014 lost 4.49% in the 24 hours to US$235.83, and is down 9.66% on the week.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization dropped 3.53% to US$1.02 trillion, while total crypto market volume gained 22.04% to US$38.21 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nNFT sales drop; Sotheby\u2019s to host auction in New York\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.88% to 2,904.24 in the past 24 hours, after losing 10.77% in the last seven days.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite also dropped 1.04% to 1,029.13, and is down 6.73% on the week. Similarly, sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, dived 6.77% to US$13.47 million over the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club topped sales by collection in the past 24 hours, rising 95.90% to US$1.32 million. But, according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, trading in the market is now so thin that little can be read into even such a large swing.\n\n\u201cIn general, volume is just so low, so on any given day it can be up or down a big percentage just from typical trading,\u201d he explained.\n\nAmong other developments in the industry, Sotheby\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest art auctioneer, will host Grails: Part II, a live digital art auction in New York, on Thursday. The auction will feature some of the most renowned generative artists in the NFT space. As much as US$10 million is expected to change hands over the course of the auction. Featured artists will include Art Blocks founder Snowfro, Tyler Hobbs, creator of Fidenzas, and Dmitri Cherniak, creator of Ringers.\n\n\u201cThe holy grail is the Ringers #879 (The Goose) by Dmitri Cherniak that is rumored to have bidders willing to pay well over the projected US$1-3 million sale price,\u201d Petscher said about the auction.\n\nElsewhere, SuperRare, a curated NFT marketplace for digital artworks, has introduced \u201cFragments of The Dreams: A Surrealist Vision,\u201d a new exhibition that showcases a collection of surrealist photography from SuperRare artists including Ben Zank, Brooke DiDonato, and Cowboy Killer.\n\nFounded in 2018, SuperRare has recorded over US$300 million in total sales and over US$180 million earned by artists to date, according to an emailed statement by the public relations spokesperson for the company.\n\nMeanwhile, Be., a subsidiary of Animoca Brands, and the Australian Football League (AFL) has announced the Throwbacks series. The group of AFL collectible NFTs feature well-known moments from the sport\u2019s past, highlights, and player profiles.\n\nSimilarly, Mocaverse, the Animoca Brands membership NFT collection, has partnered with Rarible, an NFT platform for creators and brands, to launch Mocaverse Marketplace. The Mocaverse Marketplace will offer 0% platform fees on native listings of its collection to the Mocaverse community, the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nAsian equities rise; European bourses, U.S. futures drop\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equities mostly rose on Thursday, after the People\u2019s Bank of China lowered medium term lending rates to some financial institutions. The central bank reduced roughly US$33.1 billion worth of one-year medium-term loans by 10 basis points to 2.65% from 2.75%..\n\nThe Shanghai Composite gained 0.74% and the Shenzhen Component Index rose 1.81%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index rose 2.17% but Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell slightly by 0.05%.\n\nU.S. stock futures dropped as of 8.30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.16%, and S&P 500 futures lost 0.36%. Nasdaq 100 Futures also dropped 0.66%.\n\nU.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.3% month-on-month in May, after a 0.4% increase in April, beating the expected 0.1% decline.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept its interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% but signaled it may raise rates later in the year.\n\n\u201cBoth core and headline inflation are coming down, but core is still pretty high. The target of 2% is still way off,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cAnd the Fed is obsessing over the tightness of the labor market as, despite the 15-month-long inflation battle, unemployment is still near record lows. As such, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if rates were hiked to 6% by the end of 2023,\u201d Green added.\n\nThe European Central Bank raised interest rates by an expected 25 basis points on Thursday to 3.5%, the highest rate since the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 dropped 0.59% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 lost 0.86% during afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\n\u201cWith inflation coming back as a key threat, coupled with the Fed\u2019s focus now firmly on bringing inflation back to the 2% target, the case for including commodities in portfolios grows stronger,\u201d Oliver Taylor, multi-asset fund manager, and Joven Lee, multi-asset strategist, at Schroders, said in a note on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMulti-asset investors should re-consider commodities as a strategic holding in portfolios. An arbitrary 10% allocation to commodities could provide a pickup of ~0.3% expected returns for portfolios with 10% expected volatility,\u201d Taylor and Lee added."

Discover SCENE\n\nMore than $1.2 million in Bitcoin that had not budged for over 13 years just moved.\n\nA whale transferred the stash\u201450 BTC in total\u2014to another wallet on Thursday, according to blockchain data.\n\nThe coins were mined back in June 2010 and had been sitting still ever since.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPreviously untouched Bitcoin has been making movements lately: In April, a holder who hadn\u2019t touched their coins for a decade moved $7.8 million-worth of Bitcoin to new wallets.\n\nJust days later, another long-term investor (or investors) moved $11 million in so-called digital gold after 11 years of inactivity.\n\nBitcoin \u201cwhales\u201d are investors who hoard huge amounts of cryptocurrency, many of whom don\u2019t touch it for years. It is not clear from blockchain data whether they are individuals, companies, or other entities.\n\nKirill Kretov, a developer of tools for automated trading, told Decrypt that Bitcoin mined back in 2009-2010 was mainly \u201cIT geeks\u201d but added that it was also possible \u201csome commercial entity acquired those wallets from individuals in some later years, preserving the status of those addresses in blockchain.\u201d\n\nLong-term \u201cHODLers\u201d are the most successful investors, while inexperienced retail investors who buy and sell crypto in the short-term largely lose out, according to research.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is because over the long-term, Bitcoin\u2014despite its volatility\u2014has significantly increased in value. A decade ago, the asset was priced at under $100 per coin.\n\nIf you're a short-term investor, Bitcoin has taken a beating today\u2014it\u2019s priced at $25,028 per coin, down 3.7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko, and nearly 7% in the past week. The asset has taken the rest of the crypto market with it and major altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano have plunged in price as investors weigh up what to do with the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest decision to not hike interest rates.\n\nBut the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap is still up nearly 25,000% in 10 years, making the long-term hold strategy a winner for investors."

        "content": "Proof-of-work coins that had a fair distribution at their launch are the most likely to avoid being labeled as securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to Bitcoin OG and educator Dan Held.\n\nLast week, the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase, accusing them of offering a number of altcoins as unregistered securities. As a result, many of the tokens mentioned in the lawsuit were delisted by major trading platforms, which tanked their prices.\n\nAccording to Held, Tokens that \u201chad fair or transparent launches,\u201d such as Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Monero (XMR), do not match the definition of a security that the SEC is following and are likely to avoid the current crackdown.\n\nRelated: SEC charges against Binance and Coinbase are terrible for DeFi\n\n\u201cIt definitely seems like the SEC has carved that out as something that they won\u2019t be going after,\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph.\n\nAccording to Held, the vast majority of the tokens classified as securities by the SEC in its lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance were proof-of-stake coins, or tokens with a pre-mined distribution, meaning they have more centralized ownership.\n\nHeld also said the current crackdown is mainly carried out by a single government entity, the SEC, which means the level of pressure on the industry is still far from reaching the maximum level.\n\nHeld also stated that only Bitcoin (BTC) and a few other decentralized cryptocurrencies would survive in the long run, as they are the only ones that can endure an all-out government attack.\n\nTo find out more about which cryptocurrencies can resist the ongoing SEC crackdown, watch the full video on our YouTube channel and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!"

Cryptocurrencies have rallied this year on the belief that the Fed would soon be done with its aggressive rate-hiking.\n\nToday, though, investors seemed to overlook these concerns as BlackRock submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin ETF, which would be the first spot crypto ETF if approved.\n\nDespite the plan's rejections in the past, some experts believe the proposal has a chance because BlackRock wants to enter a \"surveillance-sharing agreement,\" meaning it would share data about trading activity and their customers, in an effort to prevent market manipulation."

The ETF, if approved, will be listed on Nasdaq.\n\nThe application comes after the SEC last week sued Coinbase and Binance.US., two of the industry\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges, for allegedly breaching securities rules. That adds to uncertainties the SEC will approve the ETF, given that a Coinbase unit would act as custodian for the product.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, tweeted Thursday that the BlackRock filing is a \u201cshocker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no signs at all SEC willing to approve, but BlackRock is very connected so maybe they know something?\u201d Balchunas said.\n\nApproval of a spot-traded Bitcoin ETF in the world\u2019s biggest economy and largest financial market is seen by many investors as a stamp of approval for the digital currency and would likely unlock significant amounts of institutional investment in Bitcoin.\n\nChokepoint?\n\nHowever, some in the crypto industry reacted negatively to the BlackRock development, raising \u201cOperation Chokepoint\u201d theories that suggest governments and traditional finance aim to derail the industry because it poses a threat to their interests.\n\n\u201cIf BlackRock\u2019s spot ETF application gets approved, it is undeniable that Operation Chokepoint 2.0 was orchestrated to drive out crypto native companies and bring in large traditional firms that are buddy-buddy with the U.S. [government] to try and control Bitcoin [and] crypto,\u201d Will Clemente, co-founder of digital asset research firm Reflexivity Research, said Thursday on Twitter to his 683,700 followers.\n\nIn the SEC filing, BlackRock said: \u201cThe Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in bitcoin rather than by acquiring, holding and trading bitcoin directly on a peer-to-peer or other basis or via a digital asset exchange,\u201d\n\nThe SEC has previously rejected similar applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs filed by Grayscale, WisdomTree and VanEck. In June 2022, Grayscale sued the SEC for rejecting its application, saying the regulator failed to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles.\n\nThe securities regulator, however, has approved a number of Bitcoin futures-based ETFs.\n\nComplex\n\nTraditional retail exchanges and brokers, such as Robinhood and eToro, are \u201cnavigating complex terrain when venturing into crypto,\u201d Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs, the company behind the Sei trading blockchain, told Forkast via email.\n\n\u201cThe absence of explicit regulatory guidelines has caused setbacks, leading to some tokens being delisted resulting in crypto market volatility,\u201d said Feng, a former Goldman Sachs analyst. \u201cNonetheless, these teething issues are part of the broader industry\u2019s evolutionary process.\u201d\n\nBalchunas at Bloomberg added that the BlackRock filing lists the factors that could adversely affect the price of Bitcoin, and \u201cthey list the exchanges, which \u2018are largely unregulated and may be subject to manipulation\u2019 which is the SEC\u2019s issue with approving ETF.\u201d\n\nBitcoin gained 1.89% over the past 24 hours to trade at US$25,541 at 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has risen 54.5% so far this year, but is still far below its peak at around US$64,000 recorded in November 2021."

        "content": "Defunct crypto lender Celsius has revised its bankruptcy filing, awaiting approval from a bankruptcy court in New York after a successful acquisition deal with the Fahrenheit crypto consortium. The crypto lender filed its reorganization plan on June 15.\n\nUnder the revised plan, Celsius will convert all altcoins from customers, with the exception of \u201cCustody and Withhold accounts,\u201d to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) starting from July 1.\n\nCelsius will be selling all altcoins from all customers (except Custody and Withhold accounts) starting July 1st and will be converting them into Bitcoin and Ethereum. \u2014 Celsians (@CelsiansNetwork) June 15, 2023\n\nThe new reorganization plan proposes to deal with the claims of retail borrowers through the set off treatment. The term \u201cset off treatment\u201d refers to comparing losses against profits in a given year. Losses that are not offset against income can be carried over and offset against income in later years. A Twitter user explained how the set off treatment would work for borrowers depending on the portion of the loan they have returned:\n\nIn your example, the customer took a $25k loan secured by 2 #BTC \u2014 let\u2019s say the customer has paid 20% back and thus has $20k outstanding principal.\n\n\n\nIf the set-off counts the BTC at 7/13/22 prices, the collateral would be valued at about $40k.\n\n\n\nSubtract the $20k principal from\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZCKC1xYegm \u2014 Cam Crews (@camcrews) June 10, 2023\n\nDavid Adler from the law firm McCarter & English tweeted that the restructuring proposal by Celsius could face opposition from the borrowers. He noted that the debtor (Celsius) is demanding repayment of the loans, yet it has no intention of fulfilling its contractual obligations, such as returning the collateral to the borrowers. This could be something borrowers would object to, he added.\n\n\u201cThis proposed \u2018treatment\u2019 violates every consumer lending law out there (state, federal) and the ad hoc Borrower group will be opposing this plan.\u201c\n\nAdditionally, Celsius has asked permission to appoint Chris Ferraro as the foreign representative in connection with a British court\u2019s Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations in the United Kingdom. In this way, the company\u2019s U.K. assets would be safeguarded, and the United States Chapter 11 would be acknowledged as the \u201cforeign main proceedings\u201d to organize a global resolution.\n\nRelated: Celsius adds over 428K stETH to Lido\u2019s lengthening withdrawal queue\n\nOn May 25, the Fahrenheit crypto consortium, which comprises venture capital firm Arrington Capital and miner US Bitcoin Corp, won the bid to acquire Celsius assets. At the time, Celsius assets were estimated to be worth roughly $2 billion. Under the new deal, the new company is expected to receive about $450\u2013500 million worth of liquid cryptocurrency, while US Bitcoin Corp plans to construct a 100-megawatt Bitcoin (BTC) mining plant.\n\nCelsius paused withdrawals on June 13, 2022, after the firm became entangled in bad investments and crypto contagion following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem.\n\nMagazine: Tiffany Fong flames Celsius, FTX and NY Post: Hall of Flame"

The network\u2019s hashrate also increased to a record high.\n\nSee related article: What\u2019s next for crypto miners after US debt ceiling deal?\n\nFast facts\n\nThe mining difficulty reading came in at 52.35 trillion at block height 794,304 in Wednesday\u2019s adjustment. That follows a 3.4% rise in the previous adjustment on June 1, according to data from BTC.com.\n\nThe difficulty of mining Bitcoin typically rises when more miners are active, which increases the competition for rewards in Bitcoin in return for validating transactions on the network. The higher the difficulty, the less chance a miner has to secure an entire block on the chain, which in turn can reduce a miner\u2019s profitability.\n\nMining difficulty adjustments are correlated to changes in hashrate, the level of computing power used for mining.\n\n\u201cIn short, difficulty follows hashrate up or down, and hashrate is driven by the overall profitability of building and operating bitcoin data centers,\u201d Andrew Webber, chief of Digital Power Optimization that works with power producers to deploy Bitcoin mining operations, told Forkast in an emailed response earlier this month. \u201cIf Bitcoin spot price goes higher, it means larger profits for miners.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hashrate was at around 392.6 exahashes per second on Wednesday, an increase from the 375.4 exahashes recorded during the previous adjustment on June 1, data from Blockchain.com shows.\n\nBitcoin fell 3.63% to US$25,045 in the last 24 hours to 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, but it was up about 51% so far this year, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization lost 5.01% in value over the past seven days.\n\nSee related article: Tether stablecoin issuer taps Uruguay for Bitcoin mining using renewable energy"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIf you think something is out of the ordinary when one of the world\u2019s most prestigious financial institutions applies for a cryptocurrency investment product during a tough regulatory crackdown, you wouldn\u2019t be the only one.\n\nBlackRock, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, rocked the crypto world yesterday when it applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Though the product is technically a trust, as several eagle-eyed observers on Crypto Twitter have pointed out, it is functionally the same as a true blue ETF, experts say.\n\nIt\u2019s the \u201creal deal,\u201d according to Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Eric Balchunas, who defended the \u201cETF\u201d label yesterday on Twitter. Balchunas also pointed out that BlackRock is nearly undefeated when going up against the SEC, at 575-1, with nearly every single one of its ETF applications receiving the Commission\u2019s blessing. Other Bitcoin ETF applicants over the years can\u2019t say the same.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo all those saying the BlackRock filing is a trust and not an ETF. Do you consider $GLD to be an ETF? Well, this is same thing. Lot of structures under \u201cETF\u201d umbrella. Nothing like $GBTC. This is the real deal. pic.twitter.com/p75ZKHGxK0 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 16, 2023\n\nMany investment firms have applied for a Bitcoin ETF since 2013, only to face rejection from Wall Street\u2019s top regulator\u2014which cites concerns about market manipulation as reasons for not allowing such a product to exist in the States. An ETF is an investment vehicle that tracks the value of an underlying asset, like gold, foreign currencies, or Bitcoin.\n\nAsset managers VanEck, Ark Invest, and Bitwise have all been rejected by the regulator. The issue is so contentious, Grayscale Investments last year hit the SEC with a lawsuit after it said \u201cno\u201d to its application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\nBut BlackRock\u2019s application is different\u2014and it comes at a strange time: The SEC this year has ramped up a fierce crackdown on the digital asset industry, hitting crypto firms with lawsuit after lawsuit and even hinting that the space isn\u2019t welcome on U.S. shores at all.\n\nBlackRock, though, is no ordinary investment manager\u2014it\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest. Not only that, it wants to work with Coinbase as a custodian (a company BlackRock has worked with before). The SEC last week sued the San Francisco-based exchange for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would say this is a total shocker,\u201d Balchunas told Decrypt, adding that BlackRock\u2019s move \u201chas definitely breathed new life into the whole Bitcoin ETF race and new optimism.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that although he hadn\u2019t seen anything that indicates that the SEC has changed its position, the fact that it was BlackRock applying makes this situation different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s BlackRock\u2014it should give some hope, for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nBlackRock is a serious institution. And the application says that Bank of New York Mellon would be the custodian for the Trust\u2019s cash holdings\u2014another reputable financial institution. According to Balchunas, BlackRock has been very successful in the past with getting ETFs approved.\n\n\u201cBlackRock is just such an impressive, powerful, big, connected company,\u201d added Balchunas. \u201cAnd for them to see something here, I have to just sort of give them a lot of, I just give them a lot of respect. And so that's where I'm like, do they know something? What do they see?\u201d\n\nFun fact: BlackRock's record of getting ETFs approved by the SEC is 575-1. That's another reason this is so big, they don't play around. https://t.co/f7YIhGRmLf \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 16, 2023\n\nThe debate on Twitter as to how BlackRock\u2019s product, should it be approved, ought to be labeled is much ado about nothing, said Balchunas. He points out that the application states that the product would be grantor trust, which would make its structure similar to GLD Gold Trust, which everyone considers an ETF.\n\nBlackRock did not file for a bitcoin ETF. \u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) June 15, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can try to be technical, but we\u2019re okay with it just being called an ETF, because it really is in the spirit of the ETF or the structure. It really qualifies as an ETF,\u201d he said.\n\nIs BlackRock finally the one that brings Bitcoin to the big dance? The current regulatory environment may prove difficult to manage, but the Wall Street giant certainly has the best odds yet."

        "title": "A beginner's guide to Satoshi: The smallest unit of Bitcoin - OKX",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency to ever be created, and is now the largest by market cap. You can find it on almost any digital currency exchange. While Bitcoin was intended to act as a currency, its technological flaws make it better suited to be an investment asset. The problem with this is that 1 BTC costs a lot of money, therefore very few people can afford to buy a whole Bitcoin.\n\nLuckily, they don\u2019t have to, as Bitcoin can be broken down into smaller units. Similar to how the US dollar has a cent, Bitcoin has a satoshi \u2014 its smallest unit. This guide will tell you everything there is to know about them.\n\nWhat is a satoshi?\n\nA satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. It represents one-hundred-millionth of 1 BTC, and it was named after the mysterious creator of the Bitcoin protocol, Satoshi Nakamoto. Obviously, when Bitcoin first appeared, it didn\u2019t have the need for a smaller denomination of its currency. In the early days of Bitcoin, the price of BTC was measured in cents. However, these days, when each BTC costs thousands of dollars, it is very useful to divide it into satoshis.\n\nFortunately, even with Bitcoin\u2019s massive price appreciation, satoshis are still very affordable for crypto users. In fact, even if BTC price reached $1 million per coin, 1 satoshi would still only cost $0.01. Whether or not Bitcoin can or will ever reach that height remains to be seen.\n\nBut, the fact remains that a whole Bitcoin is still too expensive for the majority of traders. Because of that, satoshis come in quite handy, as they allow everyone to still use portions of BTC. Otherwise, Bitcoin would simply not be affordable for anyone other than the wealthy and institutional investors.\n\nHistory of satoshi\n\nThe history of satoshi starts with Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin Protocol itself. Back in 2008, when the world was struck with a financial crisis, an unknown entity called Satoshi Nakamoto emerged. To this day, it is unknown if Nakamoto was an individual, a group, a company, or something else entirely.\n\nHowever, on October 31st, 2008, Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper. This was the document that presented a decentralized network running on blockchain technology. It introduced Bitcoin as its digital currency, establishing all aspects of the project.\n\nSeveral months later, on January 3rd, 2009, Nakamoto mined Bitcoin\u2019s Genesis Block. This was, and still is, the first block in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. He created BTC so that it can be divided into smaller units. The smallest unit is one hundred millionth of 1 BTC. This unit was then named satoshi, in honor of Bitcoin\u2019s creator.\n\nThe name \u00a8satoshi\u00a8 was actually first mentioned by ribuck, a member of the BitcoinTalk forum. The user first proposed this on November 15th, 2010. Ribuck\u2019s initial idea was to use this name for one-hundredth of a BTC. However, later, he changed his mind, proposing to use the name for the smallest unit. Other members of the forum agreed, and started using the name.\n\nHow does the satoshi work?\n\nGiven that a satoshi is just a small amount of Bitcoin, it behaves exactly like BTC. It runs on Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network, and can be used for bitcoin transactions, payments, trading, and alike. Sometimes, people don\u2019t even use the name satoshi, but instead they say the amount in BTC.\n\nFor example, if you were to buy $250 worth of BTC, you can say that in two ways. You can refer to it as 0.00912295 BTC (based on the price at the time of writing). Alternatively, you can just say 912,295 satoshis. It means the same thing, and it is entirely up to the user to choose how to explain this amount. On exchanges, you will have to type it as the value of Bitcoin, since satoshi is not officially supported.\n\nHow can you use satoshis?\n\nSince a satoshi is Bitcoin, only of a different denomination, you can use them interchangeably. Satoshis do not have any advantages or flaws in comparison to BTC. The only advantage comes from the fact that a satoshi is more affordable. A whole Bitcoin is too expensive for most traders, investors, or people who use BTC for payments.\n\nAs for the actual use cases for satoshis, they can include the following:\n\nBuying and selling on nearly any digital currency exchange\n\nTrading it for other cryptocurrencies\n\nBuying products or paying for services where Bitcoin is accepted\n\nSpeculative investing\n\nBuying satoshis is also very simple. All you need to do is go to any crypto exchange, and purchase any amount of Bitcoin. To refer to our example, by buying BTC for $250, you will own 0.00912295 BTC or 912,295 satoshis. Satoshi in Bitcoin and US dollar Let's compare it to BTC and US dollars to make it easy to understand how much a satoshi is worth.\n\n1 BTC consists of 100,000,000 satoshis, and it costs $27,378 at the time of writing\n\n1 satoshi represents 0.00000001 BTC\n\nIn US dollars, the value of 1 satoshi is $0.00027\n\n$1 is (currently) worth 0.00003653 BTC, or 3,653 satoshis\n\n$10 is (currently) worth 36,526 satoshis, and $100 is worth 365,255 satoshis\n\n1 million satoshis is the same as 0.01 BTC, and is (currently) worth around $273\n\nNote that the price of Bitcoin changes constantly, which means that the dollar value of satoshi does too. In other words, 1 BTC will always be equal to 100,000,000 satoshis. However, the two will not always have the same value in USD or other fiat currencies.\n\nHow does satoshi differ from other digital denominations?\n\nMany currencies, crypto and fiat, use denominations to break down the value of the base currency. In crypto, the denominations are specific to the preferences of the cryptocurrency\u2019s designer. Bitcoin uses satoshis, as we have established. Ethereum, on the other hand, has several denominations of its own. It\u2019s similar to the penny, nickel, dime, and quarter\n\nThis makes it easier for users to trade amounts that do not require a full coin/token. Of course, their differences could be confusing for new investors, who have yet to get used to smaller denominations.\n\nWhen it comes to fractions of Bitcoin, there are several denominations to consider, including:\n\n1 satoshi, which is 0.00000001 BTC\n\n100 satoshi, called microbitcoin (\u00b5BTC), which is 0.000001 BTC\n\n100,000 satoshi, called millibitcoin (mBTC), which is 0.001 BTC\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, we have wei, which is the smallest unit of Ether.\n\n1 wei = 0.000000001 Gwei = 0.000000000000000001 ETH\n\n1,000,000,000 wei = 1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH\n\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei = 1000000000 Gwei = 1 ETH\n\nLegacy of Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin after the financial crisis of 2008, when the banks once again failed their users. To Nakamoto, they have proven that they could not be trusted with money, so he created a decentralized system. This was supposed to be an alternative for fiat currency and banking systems. Today, Bitcoin is growing into something more than just a currency. However, thanks to its design and code, it can still be used as a currency.\n\nBut, since 1 BTC is extremely expensive today, and most people cannot afford it, we turn to satoshis. The smallest unit of BTC is still affordable, being only a fraction of a cent. As of 2023, it\u2019s been over 12 years since Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared. However, his invention is still alive and conquering the world as we speak. It even kickstarted a massive industry that is growing larger and more disruptive every year. As such, BTC, as well as Satoshi, represent Nakamoto\u2019s legacy. And, with that being the case, it is quite appropriate that his name is being used for Bitcoin\u2019s smaller units.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat does satoshi mean?\n\nSatoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, representing 0.00000001 BTC. Each Bitcoin contains 100 million satoshis. This ensures that anyone can purchase any amount of Bitcoin, regardless of their budget.\n\nHow many dollars is 1 satoshi?\n\nAccording to the BTC price at the time of writing, 1 satoshi equals $0.00027. Note that, just like Bitcoin, satoshi value changes over time. This means that satoshi will not keep this value indefinitely, it will grow or drop with the market.\n\nHow many is 1000 satoshi?\n\nAs of May 2023, 1000 satoshis is worth $0.27, or 0.00001 BTC. Once again, satoshi\u2019s value changes alongside Bitcoin. 1,000 satoshis will always be worth 0.00001 BTC, but its USD value is as volatile as Bitcoin\u2019s."

        "content": "How to Buy and Sell Bitcoin in India?\n\nRegulatory concerns are not to be taken lightly, and India is no different: for example, the Indian government has said that Bitcoin can\u2019t be used as a part of the payments system. However, nobody expressly forbid people from trading in\u2026\n\nRegulatory concerns are not to be taken lightly, and India is no different: for example, the Indian government has said that Bitcoin can\u2019t be used as a part of the payments system. However, nobody expressly forbids people from trading in cryptocurrencies, as long as they\u2019re not treated as legal tender.\n\nThanks to all the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies lately, understanding how to buy and sell Bitcoin in India is critical for everyone who wants to take part in it.\n\nThere are several ways to buy, sell, or spend Bitcoin in India:\n\nOn a local or international exchange (read more about choosing one here)\n\nBy finding a local dealer on a marketplace like Localbitcoins.com and buying bitcoins from them with cash, credit card, via PayPal, etc.\n\nBy buying or selling goods or services for bitcoins.\n\nIf you would like to buy Bitcoin with cash, this can also be done by visiting the nearest Bitcoin ATM. However, at the moment there are no Bitcoin ATMs operating in India (according to CoinATMRadar.com).\n\nHow to buy or sell bitcoin in India using an exchange\n\nUsing a cryptocurrency exchange is one of the most popular and convenient ways to buy and sell bitcoin. However, due to bank-imposed (RBI) restrictions, you might not be able to fund your crypto exchange account using Indian banks. The situation has significantly affected the country\u2019s crypto landscape, even forcing to shut down some native cryptocurrency exchanges. Despite the RBI crackdown, it is still possible to buy and sell bitcoins in India.\n\nUncoin exchange in India.\n\nThe leading Indian Bitcoin exchanges are Bitbns, WazirX,Unocoin, and Koinex. Unfortunately, Unocoin does not allow for INR deposits and withdrawals at the moment, but it is possible if you use Koinex and Bitbns.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to use Bitbns, you will need to verify your account with Aadhar and PAN card to connect your bank account and deposit or withdraw cash to/from your Bitbns wallet. With Koinex, all you need to do is register on the exchange, verify your account and fund it via Loop \u2013 an Indian platform for P2P INR trades.\n\nOnce you have bitcoin, you can also use other international exchanges to trade it or sell it. The most popular ones include:\n\nBuy or sell bitcoin in India via peer-to-peer platforms (P2P)\n\nNot every bitcoin user is satisfied with the level of anonymity and security provided by online crypto exchanges. Despite their convenience, bitcoin trading remains largely popular in the peer-to-peer platforms, as they tend to offer their users more in terms of privacy and freedom.\n\nLocalBitcoins trading volume in India. Source: Coin.dance\n\nThe most popular P2P platform is LocalBitcoins. It serves as a local advertisement board for everyone who wants to buy and sell bitcoin. Once you register on the platform, you post an ad or search for local people/institutions who want to buy or sell bitcoins via your preferred methods and for your preferred price. Once you find a suitable buyer/seller, you agree on the terms of the transaction (bank transfer, Paypal, face-to-face meeting, cash, etc.). Note that not every seller is trustworthy, so be sure to check their history and reviews beforehand.\n\nPaxful trading volume in India. Source: Coin.dance\n\nPaxful is another alternative to LocalBitcoins. It works in a similar manner.\n\nBesides LocalBitcoins and Paxful, you can try decentralized P2P Bitcoin exchanges like Bisq and Cryptonex.\n\nBisq decentralizing trading platform.\n\nBisq stands out from other exchanges mentioned above, as it is a decentralized crypto exchange that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies (including bitcoin) without registration.\n\nCryptonex is another P2P crypto platform that lets you instantly exchange cryptocurrencies, INR, and other currencies using your credit/debit card. However, unlike Bisq, the service is not anonymous, and the onboarding process plus KYC/AML verification takes more time.\n\nLast but not least, you can try to buy and sell bitcoins in India using a service like WazirX. Although the platform is still in beta, it includes both crypto-to-crypto exchange and peer-to-peer trading service which lets trade INR for Tether (USDT) cryptocurrency.\n\nBuying or selling goods and services for bitcoin in India\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t purchase or sell bitcoin using the methods mentioned above, you can obtain or use your bitcoins for goods and services. Although you won\u2019t be able to spend your bitcoins wherever you like, you can check websites like Coinmap.org to discover bitcoin-friendly services.\n\nBitcoin-friendly merchants in India. Source: Coinmap.org\n\nOtherwise, you can offer goods and services for bitcoin yourself. But don\u2019t forget to check with legal authorities how you can do so according to the law.\n\nSee our other guide for more information about how to accept bitcoin as a business.\n\nThese are the methods you can use to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC) in India. Although currently there are no Bitcoin ATMs in the country, there are plenty of alternatives for how you can get BTC.\n\nDespite the unwelcome regulatory climate, more and more innovative Indian Bitcoin trading platforms are emerging, thus sparking a new wave of financial freedom, censorship-resistance, and entrepreneurship in India."

The new, open beta program will allow the public to try out the company\u2019s hardware device and accompanying software free of charge. SQ rose roughly 4% on the news Thursday.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be asked to try out the product with your own bitcoin, and share your feedback with us via interviews and surveys, which will help us shape the product,\u201d wrote Bitkey on its website. \u201cYou\u2019ll get to keep your free Bitkey hardware device to continue using with future versions of the app.\u201d\n\nThe beta version of the hardware wallet will include basic functions like sending and receiving BTC, and include both PIN code and fingerprint authentication options to unlock the device. Later on, the mobile app will incorporate 3rd party exchange partners to allow users to buy Bitcoin directly through the app \u2013 CashApp and Coinbase included.\n\nAccording to Coinbase\u2019s announcement, its partnership with Bitkey will include a \u201cjoint offer\u201d for both Coinbase One and Bitkey customers later this year. They also plan to make it easier to convert Bitcoin into local fiat currencies through its integration.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe're passionately aligned with Bitkey's vision of making self-custody more accessible and empowering individuals to take true ownership of their bitcoin,\u201d wrote the company.\n\nCashApp has allowed users to buy Bitcoin through its platform for years, and includes options to be paid in BTC, or receive coins through the lightning network. Bitkey\u2019s wallet, however, while including multi-signature functionality, will only support transactions on the main blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJack Dorsey\u2019s companies are continuing to develop infrastructure for Bitcoin, including mining tools and global on-ramps. Earlier this week, the billionaire\u2019s relief fund Start Small pledged $5 million to the Bitcoin non-profit Brink to support the network\u2019s developers.\n\n\n\nDorsey is far more supportive of Bitcoin than other crypto networks like Ethereum, which he considers an unregistered security."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application on Thursday afternoon to register a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe move was anticipated earlier in the day due to a report from CoinDesk suggesting that a filing was imminent.\n\nBlackRock, which had $9.5 trillion in assets under management in the first quarter of 2023, is working together with Coinbase (COIN), the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. The ETF would use Coinbase Custody for the ETF, and rely on the exchange's spot market data for pricing, while BNY Mellon will be the cash custodian.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlackRock previously sealed a partnership with Coinbase last August to enable clients using BlackRock's investment management platform Aladdin to possess and trade in digital assets, starting with Bitcoin. The deal gives BlackRock clients access to Coinbase\u2019s trading, custody, prime brokerage and reporting services.\n\nRegistering a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC has been a difficult task, especially for funds dealing with spot market trading. To date, not a single application for such a spot ETF has been approved by the SEC over concerns about potential fraud or manipulation in the spot market. In contrast, the SEC has approved four Bitcoin ETFs for futures trading.\n\nAn ETF is a type of investment product tied to commodities, currencies, stocks or bonds. It allows investors to have skin in the game without actually owning a particular asset. A Bitcoin ETF allows investors to invest in the world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency without having to hold it themselves\u2014rather, they just buy shares that track the asset\u2019s price.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s reluctance to green light an ETF for the Bitcoin spot market has been a sore point for would-be applicants.\n\nIn 2016, asset manager Grayscale submitted an application for a Bitcoin spot market ETF with the SEC, but was rejected by the SEC in June 2022, prompting Grayscale to respond with a lawsuit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn March, a federal judge cast doubt on the SEC's claims that data provided by Grayscale for its proposed ETF was insufficient for determining whether fraud or manipulation in the spot markets impacts futures markets in the same way.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to reflect that the application has now been filed."

Select the amount you want to buy and hit Next. Take a look at the transaction details and select Confirm. You can also use Auto Invest or Custom Purchase Order, which we'll discuss later in this guide. If you want to sell your Bitcoin, launch Cash App and go to Money > Bitcoin > Sell.

JUMP TO KEY SECTIONS Who can buy Bitcoin on Cash App?\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nHow to sell Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nWhat are the fees for buying and selling Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nWarning: We are not financial advisors, and cannot tell you if investing in Bitcoin is a good or bad idea. Bitcoin is considered a high-risk asset and is susceptible to high fluctuations in value. Do your own research and make your own decisions before buying or selling Bitcoin.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: We used a Google Pixel 7 running Android 13 to develop these instructions. We also verified all steps using an Apple iPhone 12 Mini Running iOS 16.5 to ensure the steps are the same on iOS and Android. Remember that some menus may look slightly different depending on your device and software version. By the way, we had to use iPhone screenshots, as the Android app doesn\u2019t allow taking screenshots of key pages. The steps are identical, though.\n\nWho can buy Bitcoin on Cash App?\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nAnyone with a verified Cash App account should be able to invest in Bitcoin. You will need to live somewhere in the USA and be at least 18 years of age, or whatever is considered the age of majority in your State.\n\nAdditionally, different states require more information. You will definitely need to provide your personal information, though. This will include your name, address, birthday, and in many cases, your social security number. You might also need to verify your identity by taking pictures of your ID and face.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nOnce you have your account ready and verified, buying Bitcoin is super simple. You must know about the different types of Bitcoin purchases you can make on Cash App, though. There are three types of Bitcoin purchases. Let\u2019s talk about them before moving forward.\n\nBitcoin order types: Standard Order: Buy Bitcoin on spot, using the current price.\n\nBuy Bitcoin on spot, using the current price. Custom Purchase Order: Set a specific price for your order to be fulfilled.\n\nSet a specific price for your order to be fulfilled. Auto Invest: You can trigger automatic Bitcoin purchases daily, weekly, or bi-weekly.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin on Cash App: Launch Cash App. Tap on the Money tab. It looks like a bank building, or your balance, if you have any. Select the Buy bitcoin option. This will show up as Bitcoin if you already have Bitcoin. Tap on the Buy button. By default, the purchase will be a Standard Order. Tap on the Change Order Type option to switch to Custom Purchase Order or Auto Invest and follow the instructions. Ignore this step if you want to simply buy Bitcoin right away. Select how much, in dollars, you want to invest in Bitcoin. Then hit Next. Check the Bitcoin purchase details and hit Confirm. Select Done.\n\nCash App will finish the purchase, and you\u2019ll have your Bitcoin in your wallet. If you don\u2019t have enough money in your Cash App balance to cover the purchase, the app will pull the remaining funds from your linked debit card. This will be reflected in the purchase details, before confirming the transaction.\n\nHow to sell Bitcoin on Cash App Seling Bitcoin is just as easy as buying it! Let\u2019s show you how to cash out Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nHow to sell Bitcoin on Cash App: Launch Cash App. Tap on the Money tab. It looks like a bank building, or your balance, if you have any. Go into the Bitcoin option. Tap on the Sell button. By default, the purchase will be a Standard Order. Tap on the Change Order Type option to switch to a Custom Sell Order and follow the instructions. Ignore this step if you want to simply sell Bitcoin right away. Select how much, in dollars, you want to sell. Then hit Next. Check the Bitcoin sell details and hit Confirm. Select Done.\n\nYour money will go straight to your Cash App balance. You can use it for transfers, spend it on your Cash Card, or use the Cash Out feature to send it to your bank account.\n\nWhat are the fees for buying and selling Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nNothing is free, especially in the world of crypto. Buying and selling Bitcoin on Cash App has a cost. That said, Cash App\u2019s fees are considered pretty fair compared to its main competitors. The bad news is Cash App isn\u2019t very clear about its Bitcoin fees.\n\nAs of the time of this writing, the fees start at about 3% for purchasing $1 of Bitcoin, and get reduced the more you purchase. For example, We checked how much the fees would be for purchasing $100, $1,000, and $10,000. These would be $2.25, $17.50, and $75.20, accordingly. This would mean you\u2019re paying 2.25% for buying $100, 1.75% for $1,000, or 0.75% for $10,000.\n\nOf course, these fees can change in the future. And you should also take into account that there is a margin, also known as spread, applied to the purchase. Exchanges compare prices across multiple exchanges and adjust the price accordingly. This is mostly to ensure the company doesn\u2019t lose money if the Bitcoin price changes during the time your transaction takes.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan you send Bitcoin from Cash App to another wallet? Yes! You can send the Bitcoin you have in your Cash App to any other Bitcoin wallet. We actually have a full guide on how to send Bitcoin on Cash App, if you need some help.\n\nIs Cash App a Bitcoin wallet? Cash App offers a Bitcoin wallet. More specifically, it is a custodian of your Bitcoin wallet. You just don\u2019t get access to your Bitcoin address private keys.\n\nWhat happens if I sell my Bitcoin on Cash App? When you sell your Bitcoin on Cash App, all the money will go straight to your balance in the app. You can then transfer it to other users, spend it using the Cash Card, or send it to your bank.\n\nIs buying Bitcoin on Cash App safe? Buying Bitcoin on Cash App is very safe. The company is well-established and regulated. You have to be careful of possible scammers trying to get you to send them BTC, but that applies to any crypto exchange. What may not be so safe is keeping your Bitcoin on Cash App. Most experts and enthusiasts suggest moving your Bitcoin to a cold wallet for long-term storage. This is because Cash App is a company that could go bankrupt, suffer from hacks, and more. And since Bitcoin is not regulated, it is not FDIC-insured or protected in any way.\n\nWhere is my Bitcoin address on Cash App? To find your Bitcoin address on Cash App, launch the app and go to Money > Bitcoin > Send or receive > Receive bitcoin. Tap on the QR code to see your addresses for the Bitcoin Network and Lightning Network.\n\nComments"

        "content": "NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / June 15, 2023 / DexOrdi, the pioneering decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on Bitcoin Network, is driving innovation in the DeFi landscape on the Bitcoin network. Leveraging advanced Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, DexOrdi is revolutionizing decentralized trading with its focus on efficiency, liquidity provision, security, and user accessibility. By paving the way for a new era of decentralized finance based on the BRC-20 standard, DexOrdi is empowering traders to unlock the full potential of decentralized trading on Bitcoin Network.\n\nDexOrdi, Thursday, June 15, 2023, Press release picture\n\nThe BRC-20 standard is an experimental token standard designed to facilitate the creation and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain through the Ordinals protocol. Inspired by Ethereum's token standards, BRC-20 tokens offer unique mechanisms and functions. Although BRC-20 tokens gained considerable popularity in the first half of 2023, it is important to note that they are still in the experimental phase, requiring users to exercise utmost caution.\n\nDexOrdi is at the forefront of integrating BRC-20 tokens into its decentralized trading platform. By enabling direct trading of BRC-20 tokens with Bitcoin on dexordi and vice versa, DexOrdi provides seamless interoperability between Bitcoin-based assets and BRC-20 tokens. Moreover, BRC-20 tokens inherit the robust security features of the Bitcoin network, offering protection against double-spending and 51% network attacks.\n\nThe creation of BRC-20 tokens emerged from the introduction of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin's protocol in January 2023. This development spurred the exploration of fungible tokens on the network. In March 2023, a pseudonymous programmer named Domo established the BRC-20 token standards, enabling the minting of fungible tokens on Bitcoin. The first deployed BRC-20 token, named \"ordi,\" gained swift integration support from Bitcoin wallets. Subsequently, numerous other BRC-20 tokens were launched, some experiencing significant market capitalization and price surges by May 2023. The increasing demand for BRC-20 tokens contributed to a surge in Bitcoin transaction fees and notable congestion on the Bitcoin network.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that the BRC-20 token standard is experimental, carrying inherent uncertainties and risks. Users are advised to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging with BRC-20 tokens, considering their limited utility and the dynamic nature of their future prospects.\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem continues to evolve, DexOrdi remains committed to providing traders with a reliable and transformative platform.

        "title": "We asked ChatGPT to write a rap song about Bitcoin by SEC's Gary Gensler - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Gary Gensler, the chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has faced scrutiny recently for his approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. He has been accused of not providing clear guidelines for digital assets while his agency takes action against prominent crypto entities such as Coinbase and Binance for listing potentially unregistered securities.\n\nCritics argue that Gensler\u2019s approach is stifling the crypto industry\u2019s growth, with opinions varied over his approach. To capture Gensler\u2019s perspective on Bitcoin (BTC), Finbold sought insights from the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform, ChatGPT, which presented Gensler\u2019s views as a rap song.\n\nInterestingly, the rap lyrics supported Bitcoin, which partly contradicts the SEC and Gensler\u2019s stance on the cryptocurrency market. In the first verse, Gensler emphasized the song\u2019s supposed theme by acknowledging that Bitcoin has made the market go wild.\n\nThe chorus stressed Bitcoin\u2019s status as digital gold, highlighting its comparison to the precious metal as a potential store of value and hedge against inflation.\n\nIt also acknowledges that Bitcoin has made investors wealthy, but it cautions about the associated risks and the importance of regulating the asset.\n\n\u201cBitcoin, Bitcoin, the digital gold, But it\u2019s a wild ride, so I gotta be bold. Investors getting rich, but risks are high, Gotta regulate this game, gotta give it a try,\u201d the chorus reads.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s revolutionary nature\n\nIn the second verse, ChatGPT proposes that Gensler would rap about Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and the revolutionary approach but also delves into its associated risks. The verse addresses issues such as market manipulation and fraud while emphasizing the importance of safeguarding investors.\n\nMoving to the fourth verse, Gensler would purportedly raps about the crucial need for transparency in the crypto sector and the necessity of regulations. However, the verse also acknowledges the significant innovations brought about by the industry.\n\n\u201cTransparency is key, we need regulations in place, AML and KYC, gotta maintain the pace. I\u2019m all for innovation, but let\u2019s not forget, We need safeguards in this crypto asset,\u201d the fourth verse reads.\n\nIn the final verse, the emphasis is on Gensler\u2019s mission to educate the masses about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It is suggested that Gensler would rap about the importance of this mission. The verse would also touch upon the role of lawmakers in shaping rules that promote fairness in the crypto sector, according to the tool\u2019s analysis.\n\nFor the bridge, ChatGPT envisions a Gensler rap song on Bitcoin that provides a general overview of the sector. The lyrics highlight the immense potential of blockchain technology and call for unity among players in the crypto industry to create a safer space while embracing innovation and protecting investors.\n\nCrypto is here to stay\n\nIn the outro, ChatGPT suggests that Gensler would emphasize the permanence of the crypto space, reinforcing the idea that it is here to stay.\n\n\u201cSo remember, my friends, crypto\u2019s here to stay, But we must proceed with caution, every single day. Gary Gensler and the SEC, we\u2019re on the case, To ensure a thriving market with a solid embrace,\u201d reads the outro.\n\nIndeed, Gensler\u2019s approach to crypto regulation has also caught the attention of lawmakers. As reported by Finbold back in April, Gensler was grilled by the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee over practices in the sector.\n\nHere\u2019s the full rap song \u2018by Gary Gensler\u2019:\n\n(Verse 1)\n\nYo, it\u2019s Gensler, SEC regulator in control,\n\nBitcoin\u2019s on the rise, but there\u2019s risks untold.\n\nDecentralized gold, disrupting the game,\n\nBut market manipulation is causing some pain.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nBitcoin, the digital gold of the town,\n\nBut we gotta regulate, put the wild ride down.\n\nInvestors getting rich, but risks are high,\n\nI\u2019m here to protect, so let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n(Verse 2)\n\nTransparency\u2019s crucial, regulations in sight,\n\nAML and KYC, keeping things right.\n\nWe need safeguards, this market needs care,\n\nEducating the masses, leveling the playing square.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nBitcoin, the digital gold of the town,\n\nBut we gotta regulate, put the wild ride down.\n\nInvestors getting rich, but risks are high,\n\nI\u2019m here to protect, so let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n(Verse 3)\n\nInnovation\u2019s fantastic, but let\u2019s not forget,\n\nFrauds and scams lurk, causing regret.\n\nCollaborating with lawmakers, shaping the rules,\n\nEnsuring fairness, protecting investors like jewels.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nBitcoin, the digital gold of the town,\n\nBut we gotta regulate, put the wild ride down.\n\nInvestors getting rich, but risks are high,\n\nI\u2019m here to protect, so let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n(Verse 4)\n\nBlockchain\u2019s potential, a revolution it brings,\n\nBut we must address the dark side it swings.\n\nCreating a safer space, where trust can thrive,\n\nBalancing innovation and keeping markets alive.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nBitcoin, the digital gold of the town,\n\nBut we gotta regulate, put the wild ride down.\n\nInvestors getting rich, but risks are high,\n\nI\u2019m here to protect, so let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n(Outro)\n\nTogether we\u2019ll build a robust crypto land,\n\nWhere investors are secure, and scams are banned.\n\nGary Gensler and the SEC, leading the way,\n\nEnsuring a prosperous market, day by day.\n\n-The End-\n\nFeatured image via Bloomberg YouTube."

        "title": "How Bitcoin Nodes and Bitcoin Miners Differ - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin Nodes and Miners are two fundamental components that work in unison to ensure the functionality, security, and integrity of the network. Despite being interchangeably used at times, these terms denote distinct entities with separate roles.\n\nNodes function as communication hubs, storing the blockchain, validating transactions, and relaying information. Conversely, miners provide computational power to create new blocks, validate transactions, maintain consensus, and secure the network.\n\nThis article elucidates the differences between Bitcoin nodes and miners, spotlighting their unique contributions to the network.\n\nBitcoin Nodes: The Backbone of the Network\n\nBitcoin nodes, the bedrock of the decentralized network, function as essential communication hubs. These are computers running Bitcoin software, performing crucial roles to sustain the network\u2019s operation. Let\u2019s delve into the key characteristics and responsibilities of nodes:\n\n1. Storing the Blockchain:\n\nNodes store a complete copy of the blockchain, the public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. By maintaining this local copy, nodes contribute to the network\u2019s overall resilience and accessibility.\n\n2. Transaction and Block Validation:\n\nNodes play a crucial role in validating transactions and blocks. They enforce the consensus rules of the Bitcoin protocol, ensuring that transactions adhere to the specified format and include valid signatures. This verification process helps maintain the integrity of the network.\n\n3. Relaying Information:\n\nNodes actively participate in the dissemination of information within the Bitcoin network. When a new transaction or block is verified, nodes relay this information to other nodes, propagating it across the network. This efficient distribution of data helps maintain network synchronization.\n\n4. Supporting Wallet Functionality:\n\nSome nodes also provide wallet functionality, enabling users to create and manage Bitcoin addresses, sign transactions securely, and interact with the blockchain. These nodes act as a bridge between users and the broader network, facilitating Bitcoin transactions and enhancing user experience.\n\nBitcoin Miners: Powering the Network and Securing Consensus\n\nBitcoin miners are specialized nodes that contribute computational power to safeguard the network and uphold consensus. Their primary tasks involve solving complex mathematical problems and appending new blocks to the blockchain. Let\u2019s explore the unique roles miners play:\n\n1. Block Validation:\n\nMiners, like regular nodes, validate transactions before incorporating them into new blocks. They ensure adherence to network rules and confirm the presence of sufficient computational work, known as proof-of-work, attached to each transaction.\n\n2. Block Creation Through Mining:\n\nMiners gather validated transactions and engage in the process of mining. They use substantial computational power to find solutions to cryptographic puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle creates a new block, which is then added to the blockchain.\n\n3. Consensus Mechanism:\n\nMiners provide the decentralized consensus mechanism that governs the Bitcoin network. Through their collective computational effort, miners agree on the order of transactions and append them to the blockchain. This agreement ensures a reliable transaction history and prevents double spending.\n\n4. Network Security:\n\nThe computational power expended by miners in the mining process strengthens the network\u2019s security. It makes it economically costly for malicious actors to attack the network or attempt to rewrite transaction history. This aspect highlights the importance of miners in maintaining the network\u2019s robustness and integrity.\n\nOne critical aspect of Bitcoinmining is the creation of new Bitcoin. Miners, through the process of mining, not only validate transactions but also compete to decipher cryptographic puzzles, resulting in the creation of new Bitcoin as block rewards. These block rewards comprise newly minted bitcoins, which incentivize miners to continue contributing their computational power to the network\u2019s security and operation.\n\nHere is a table that summarizes the key differences between Bitcoin nodes and miners:\n\nFeature Bitcoin Node Bitcoin Miner Role Verifies transactions and blocks, relays information about the network Adds new blocks to the blockchain, secures the network Equipment Regular computer Specialized hardware Reward None Newly created bitcoins and transaction fees Importance Essential for the network to function Essential for the network to be secure\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while every miner is a node, not all nodes are miners. For instance, light nodes, which do not store a full copy of the blockchain, are unable to verify transactions or blocks. However, they can still relay information about the network to other nodes.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGrasping the differences between nodes and miners provides insights into the complex workings of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Their collaboration ensures the smooth operation, security, and decentralized nature of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to gain popularity and showcases its potential for financial gains, many individuals are exploring Bitcoin trading as a promising investment opportunity. Apps like the bitqt app have introduced automated trading features to attract these individuals. However, it\u2019s critical to remember that trading in cryptocurrencies involves risks, and individuals should conduct comprehensive research and seek professional advice before partaking in any investment activities."

        "content": "Miami \u201cbitcoin mayor\u201d Francis Suarez has a new pitch to potential voters and investors: Bitcoin President. The 45-year-old mayor released a brief video announcing his candidacy on Thursday and filed FEC paperwork officially entering him into an increasingly crowded 2024 Republican primary field. Suarez, who bills himself as an energetic, tech-friendly futurist was one of several prominent US mayors who emphatically boosted Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the lead-up to the industry\u2019s disastrous collapse last year.\n\nHe Tossed His Bitcoin, Now He Wants It Back CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video He Tossed His Bitcoin, Now He Wants It Back\n\nSuarez\u2019s announcement video shows him literally \u201crunning\u201d for president through Miami\u2019s lush city streets, making pit stops along the way at his parent\u2019s home and former elementary school. \u201cI have always been a runner,\u201d Saurez says moments before dramatically staring into the camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Miami mayor spent the remainder of the video taking a victory lap, noting an uptick in the city\u2019s economy, a \u201chistoric\u201d lowering of taxes, and lessening unemployment during his two terms. Suarez made a point to emphasize Miami\u2019s recent attraction of tech companies and investors, some of which decamped in the city after fleeing former hubs during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cToday, our city is a major technology hub,\u201d Suarez notes while weaving his way through traffic. \u201cBecause we chose to embrace innovation.\u201d Suarez\u2019s office did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat about crypto?\n\n\n\nOne area notably absent from Suarez\u2019s announcement video, however, was his embrace of cryptocurrency. Suarez was among the most vocal US politicians in 2021 singing crypto\u2019s praises, with a stated goal of transforming Miami into the world\u2019s first Web3 city. The mayor briefly explored paying residents dividends from a municipal \u201cbitcoin yield.\u201d At one point, Suarez even proposed giving municipal workers in the city the option to get paid and pay their taxes in Bitcoin. Suarez himself also revealed he would accept 100% of his own government salary in bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy wife asked me if that was a good idea, but certainly when governments are spending that kind of money that they are, when you have inflation at the point that it is, when you have rampant overspending in government and deficit spending, all of that pushes in favor of an increase in the price of Bitcoin,\u201d Suarez told Fox News in a November 2021 interview.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough it\u2019s hard to say what effect those antics had on driving up actual cryptocurrency adoption in the city, it did lead to a hefty inflow of new campaign donations sent by wealthy tech investors. The pandering also led to an influx of boom-time crypto capital into the city. In maybe the clearest example of this, Miami-Dade officials in 2021 signed a 19-year $135 million naming rights agreement with FTX to make the now disgraced cryptocurrency exchange the face of the Miami Heat\u2019s basketball stadium. The stadium revoked that name last year following FTX\u2019s sudden collapse and its founder\u2019s criminal indictment.\n\nSaurez hasn\u2019t disavowed cryptocurrencies, but he also isn\u2019t mentioning it with the same level of frequent glee as he once did. The cryptocurrency industry experienced possibly the worst downturn in its brief history last year thanks to the collapse of multiple exchanges, criminal indictments, and more than a handful of lost fortunes. Suarez\u2019s own Bitcoin salary took a plunge last year when the price of Bitcoin tanked by as much as 40% in a two-month span. The mayor still stands by the salary decision but he, like other crypto evangelists politicians, has since taken his foot off the Bitcoin hype accelerator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy salary is actually up,\u201d Suarez assured CNBC in January. \u201cIt\u2019s actually been a pretty good investment!\u201d\n\nSuarez enters the 2024 Republican presidential primary race less than one week after the front runner, former President Donald Trump, was indicted by a federal grand jury on criminal charges related to his improper storage of classified White House documents. So far, the list of contenders hoping to steal Trump\u2019s chokehold on the party is already a dozen strong and includes Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former Vice President Mike Pence, and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott along with a handful of wishful longshots."

        "content": "BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, on Thursday filed for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency, as the asset class comes under intense regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust will use Coinbase Custody as its custodian, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The U.S. regulator has yet to approve any applications for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nLast year, BlackRock launched a spot bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the United States.\n\nThe move comes at a time when the global cryptocurrency industry has been caught in the crosshairs of the U.S. securities regulator on alleged violations of securities laws.\n\nEarlier this month, the regulator sued major exchanges Coinbase and Binance in high-profile lawsuits that reverberated through the digital assets industry.\n\n\"The fact that BlackRock, a well-respected and established asset management company, has filed for a Bitcoin ETF could be seen as a positive development in the quest for regulatory approval,\" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology group XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.\n\n\"It also shows resilience of the public's interest in crypto.\"\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would track bitcoin's underlying market price. Proponents say an ETF would give investors exposure to bitcoin without directly buying it.\n\nThe SEC rejected Grayscale Investment LLC\u2019s application last year to convert its flagship spot Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nGrayscale sued the SEC, claiming that the regulator was acting arbitrarily in rejecting applications for spot bitcoin ETFs when it had previously approved bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe SEC has also rejected proposals for spot bitcoin ETFs from firms including Fidelity, Cboe Global Markets and NYDIG.\n\nBitcoin prices closed up 2 percent on Thursday after the announcement. They were last at $25,506 on Friday. The largest cryptocurrency is up 54 percent in the year."
