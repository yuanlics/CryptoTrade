        "title": "El Salvador's Bitcoin strategy evolved with the bear market in 2022 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency adoption has been on the rise in El Salvador in recent years, with the country becoming the first in the world to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender. This landmark decision has attracted the attention of the global cryptocurrency community and has sparked discussions on the potential benefits and challenges of widespread adoption.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s controversial move with its cryptocurrency adoption would not have been possible if it was not due to President Nayib Bukele, who garnered international attention after announcing the Bitcoin adoption plan and passed it into law. The legislation required all businesses within the country to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for goods and services. As a legal tender, Bitcoin now has the same status as traditional fiat currencies, which worries other regulators, economic experts and many everyday Salvadorans.\n\nThe country\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender has made it easier for Salvadorans living abroad to send money back to their families in the country through remittances. Chivo Wallet, the official wallet of the Salvadoran government, claimed to have onboarded 2.2 million Salvadorans a month after declaring Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThis could potentially increase financial inclusion for these individuals, who previously relied on cash transactions or informal financial services. Every user who successfully downloaded the app immediately received $30 in Bitcoin. However, this massive adoption was not as smooth as hoped, as it was faced with numerous roadblocks, including missing funds, system issues and disinterest from everyday citizens.\n\nClick \u201cCollect\u201d below the illustration at the top of the page or follow this link.\n\nBukele also proposed the creation of a low-tax Bitcoin city at the base of the Conchagua volcano, which would power the city's infrastructure and crypto mining operations. The project would be funded through the sale of $1 billion worth of bonds known as Bitcoin bonds or volcano bonds, which have an annual interest rate of 6.5% and are intended to be in effect for 10 years.\n\nThe adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador has generated a lot of interest and has the potential to pave the way for the wider adoption of cryptocurrency in other countries, but it remains to be seen how this experiment will play out.\n\nWhat worked and what didn't?\n\nEl Salvador's decision to make Bitcoin legal tender has caused concern among its citizens due to the cryptocurrency's volatile nature and the uncertain success of the plan. While some parts of the implementation of Bitcoin as a legal tender went according to plan, many didn't, which resulted in some unintended consequences.\n\nEl Salvador's credit rating and ties with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have suffered as a result of Bitcoin adoption. Local borrowers have been forced to charge higher interest rates as investors have become less willing to lend to the nation. Moreover, due to the significant risks to financial and market integrity, financial stability and consumer protection, the IMF advised El Salvador to revoke Bitcoin's legal lender status due to its volatility as well as its usage in fraud and other criminal activities.\n\nRecent: Crypto companies aim to build trust within future products and services\n\nThe World Bank has also raised worries about the negative environmental effects of cryptocurrencies that El Salvador's Bitcoin strategy has brought to light.\n\nThe majority of Salvadorans still lack knowledge about Bitcoin. Despite promises of economic freedom and servicing the unbanked, blockchain tech can be clunky from a user experience perspective, and many find it easier to continue to transact in U.S. dollars.\n\nFurthermore, El Salvador is a poor country with one of the lowest rates of internet use in the Americas. There are many vendors, street hawkers and farmers who are not equipped to handle cryptocurrency transactions. Thus, the usage of Bitcoin for everyday transactions is low, despite the government's big push.\n\nHowever, the decision to open up the economy to Bitcoin has managed to attract foreign investment to the country. Carlos G. Alfaro, technical sales manager at blockchain software firm Koibanx, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cI have managed to meet several foreign investors who have come because of the Bitcoin Law but are not only investing in the blockchain industry \u2014 they are also investing in different areas such as hotels, real estate, and franchise companies.\u201d\n\nBefore the Bitcoin Law, a large portion of Salvadorans lacked a mechanism to retain their money digitally and conduct transactions with one another. Hence, the project introduced many residents to the idea of savings and investments.\n\nAnd while participation and use of Bitcoin may remain relatively low among the populace, Alfaro stated that the $30 Bitcoin reward from the Chivo Wallet has served as a catalyst to get citizens more interested in savings and investments, adding:\n\n\u201cI think that, little by little, the average citizen is finding how to use it, from having a small bank account, sending money between countries both personally and with companies, being able to save a little and learning how investments work.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s investment strategy has also become more moderate. The country has bought Bitcoin 11 times at different amounts and purchase prices based on tweets posted by Bukele himself. The latest such purchase was 80 BTC for $1.5 million on June 30, 2022, but now El Salvador is buying 1 Bitcoin per day using a dollar cost averaging strategy to minimize the impact of Bitcoin's volatility on the country's economy.\n\nExpectations for 2023 and beyond\n\nDemand for Bitcoin in El Salvador is still present, and with the announced plans to build a Bitcoin city, the country hopes to continue to attract BTC investors in the years to come.\n\nIn 2023, El Salvador is expected to expand its administrative capacities for dealing with cryptocurrency use in its economy, including addressing any possible criminal activities. Guillermo Contreras, CEO of DitoBanx, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cIn this sense, there has been a lot of openness, cooperation and communication between the different government institutions and the companies that are operating under this heading, and now precisely this issue is being further consolidated with the opening of the National Bitcoin Office that will function as a central entity to deal with all issues related to it.\u201d\n\nThe new Digital Assets Issuance Law, which will be implemented in 2023, permits the issuing of El Salvador's Bitcoin bonds to fund the infrastructure of the Bitcoin city and buy more Bitcoin. This law will also permit the development of blockchain-based business models in a controlled setting.\n\nRecent: Redeeming physical NFTs: Easier said than done?\n\nEl Salvador continues to take concrete steps so that Bitcoin will be incorporated into financial literacy programs across the country. In 2023, the country\u2019s Ministry of Education is expected to address educational concerns at a mass level with a training module in financial education that incorporates updated content such as cryptocurrencies and electronic wallets.\n\nContreras concluded: \u201cThe implementation of Bitcoin and digital wallets allowed more than four million people to safeguard their money, receive money from remittances and other sources safely and instantly. At the beginning, of course, there was a feeling of fear of the unknown, but fortunately, El Salvador had already experienced something similar when we adopted the U.S. dollar as legal tender instead of the Salvadoran colones. It is a process that took a bit of time, but finally users were able to confirm that it was real money just like any other currency, and although there are still some challenges to overcome, the path is well marked and there is a good perspective.\u201d"

        "title": "Michael Saylor and the Philosophy of Bitcoin Maximalism - DailyCoin",
        "content": "In 2020, Micheal Saylor made a shocking announcement on an earning call with shareholders. He painted a bleak picture for the future of fiat currency and argued that the returns from holding cash were falling, and the strength of the dollar was fading.\n\nConsequentially, Saylor argued, the smartest thing would be to hold the currency of the future instead of fiat. He said the future was Bitcoin, which was attractive because it was a dependable store of value.\n\nSaylor said he believed that the way forward for MicroStrategy was to buy Bitcoin with its cash reserves. At the time, MicroStrategy had reserves of about $550 million. Since the company only needed around $50 million on hand to operate, Saylor had enough leeway to invest as much as he could in Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor controlled over 70% of MicroStrategy\u2019s voting shares, so he technically had supreme control over the company.\n\nBitcoin Maximalism\n\nIn the short term, Saylor\u2019s investment paid off. MicroStrategy bought over twenty thousand Bitcoins in August 2020 at an average price of around $11,500.\n\nMicroStrategy announced in December 2020 that it had bought a total of 70,000 Bitcoins with an average purchase price of around $16,000. As MicroStrategy bought Bitcoins, so did Michael Saylor.\n\nIn October 2020, Saylor announced that he\u2019d personally purchased 17,732 bitcoin at an average price of $9,882. By October 2021, the Bitcoin Saylor personally held was worth over a billion dollars. When he made the purchase, he\u2019d paid over two hundred million. That reflected an unrealized capital gain of over 500% in a year. Not even the best-performing hedge funds could offer such astonishing returns.\n\nSaylor had gone all in on Bitcoin and reaped extraordinary returns. The share price of MicroStrategy was rising due to its crypto investment, and Saylor\u2019s wealth was ballooning out of control.\n\nIf Saylor was only in it for the money, he might have started selling at the top. His investment had seen a 500% increase, and he\u2019d made as much money as anyone could make in under a year. But Saylor didn\u2019t just see Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. He saw it as the currency of the future, and the price of Bitcoin was a mere addendum. That\u2019s why in 2021, as Bitcoin started to slip and tumble down, he posted a tweet declaring he was a Bitcoin maximalist."

As authorities watched helplessly, Harmon swiped 713 digital tokens valued at about $4.9 million. They\u2019re now worth more than twice that amount."

        "content": "Most people don\u2019t think about the Federal Reserve very often, and only a select few contemplate the effects that the U.S. central bank has on investors. But over the past few years, that\u2019s begun to change. Many economists and keen market watchers are making the case that years of loose monetary policies from the Fed and other central banks following the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) helped create an \u201ceverything bubble\u201d\u2014and now it\u2019s popping.\n\nThe everything bubble idea isn\u2019t new. For years before 2022\u2019s stock market woes, leading minds on Wall Street including the investing legend Jeremy Grantham warned about a brewing \u201csuperbubble.\u201d The idea is that near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing (QE)\u2014a policy where the Fed would buy mortgage-backed securities and government bonds to boost lending and investment in the economy\u2014pushed investors toward riskier investments, allowed unsustainable business models to thrive on cheap debt, and helped fuel the Pandemic Housing Boom.\n\nRenowned investment manager Jeremy Grantham believes we\u2019re in a \u201csuperbubble.\u201d Lane Turner\u2014The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but in retrospect a lot of outlandish financial predictions accompanied this era of easy money. And the fallout for Americans hasn\u2019t been pretty, as inflation continues to rage and recession fears mount. But there is a silver lining for the finance community. The everything bubble provided some of the most ridiculous\u2014and hilarious\u2014forecasts in history.\n\nFrom cryptocurrency experts and hedge fund managers to economists and investment banks, the easy money era was filled with bulls who believed the good times would never end. Here\u2019s a look at some of their strangest calls.\n\nThe Bitcoin bulls\n\nThe cryptocurrency boom of 2020 and 2021 was unprecedented. Between January 2020 and the peak of the crypto fervor in November 2021, the industry\u2019s total value grew to over $3 trillion and Bitcoin prices soared roughly 800%.\n\nThe crypto faithful were sure that the party was just beginning. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper said in June 2021 that Bitcoin would hit $250,000 by the end of 2022. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be right on this one,\u201d he assured CNBC\u2019s Jade Scipioni.\n\nBitcoin ended up finishing 2022 just above $16,500, but just last month, Draper repeated his call for Bitcoin to hit $250,000\u2014this time he said it would be by the middle of 2023.\n\n\u201cI expect a flight to quality and decentralized crypto like bitcoin, and for some of the weaker coins to become relics,\u201d Draper told CNBC.\n\nTim Draper did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDraper wasn\u2019t the only leading figure to jump on the Bitcoin train during the easy money era and make lofty forecasts either. ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood was the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin via the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) as a part of her tech-focused exchange-traded ETFs in 2015.\n\nArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood is long on Bitcoin and critical of FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried. Hugo Amaral\u2014SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nThe bet led Wood to face serious criticism from her peers, but barring a brief crypto winter in 2018, it paid off as Bitcoin\u2019s price soared to over $65,000 by November 2021.\n\nWood was sure that the good times would last throughout the bull market. In November 2020, she told Barron\u2019s that institutional adoption of crypto would drive Bitcoin\u2019s price to $500,000 by 2026 and repeatedly \u201cbought the dip\u201d whenever Bitcoin prices fell. Wood even told The Globe and Mail in a February 2020 interview that Bitcoin was \u201cone of the largest positions\u201d in her retirement account.\n\nThe ARK Invest CEO remained bullish even at the start of 2022, when Bitcoin prices had fallen from their highs of over $65,000 to just under $50,000. She argued that the leading cryptocurrency would touch $1 million by 2030 in ARK\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas 2022\u201d annual research report.\n\nSince then Bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped more than 60%, but Wood and her team aren\u2019t fazed, and still believe that their prediction is fair.\n\n\u201cWe think Bitcoin is coming out of this smelling like a rose,\u201d Wood told Bloomberg in December, arguing that institutions will eventually buy into Bitcoin after it is \u201cbattle tested\u201d by the crypto winter.\n\nCathie Wood did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nTom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, who previously served as chief equity strategist at JPMorgan and spent over 25 years on Wall Street, has also been a perennial Bitcoin bull. In early 2022, he predicted that Bitcoin would hit $200,000 in the coming years.\n\nAnd despite the recent fall, which he admitted has been \u201chorrific\u201d for investors, Lee told CNBC in November that he still believes Bitcoin will come out of the current downtrend and hit his target. But while many crypto forecasters are sticking by their lofty estimates, Wall Street has been walking back some of theirs.\n\nTom Lee did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nLofty stock market forecasts\n\nInvestment banks made some pretty dramatic forecasts during the cheap money era. After the stock market soared throughout the pandemic, returning 28% to investors, Wall Street was confident that things would slow down in 2022, but not to the extent that they actually did.\n\nInvestment banks expected the S&P 500 to end 2022 at 4,825, representing only a mild 1% gain for the year. Instead, the blue-chip index dropped roughly 20%.\n\nThe (perhaps unwarranted) bullishness among investment banks was particularly clear when looking at the price targets for growth stocks that benefited from pandemic trends. The online used car retailer Carvana, for example, soared throughout the pandemic as used car prices rose to record highs.\n\nThe firm was able to take advantage of consumers\u2019 inability or unwillingness to shop for vehicles in person during COVID, leading some analysts to give incredibly bullish forecasts.\n\nIn January 2022, Morgan Stanley\u2019s auto analyst Adam Jonas called Carvana the \u201capex predator in auto retail\u201d and assigned a $430 12-month price target to the stock. Since then, shares of the online car retailer have plummeted more than 97% to just $4.48\u2014and some analysts believe more pain lay ahead for investors.\n\nMorgan Stanley has been fined $35 million after devices containing millions of its customers\u2019 data turned up in an online auction. Mario Tama\u2014Getty Images\n\nMorgan Stanley did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nNew Construct\u2019s CEO David Trainer warned investors in June that Carvana was burning cash at an unsustainable rate and may not survive.\n\n\u201cTime is running out for cash-burning companies kept afloat with easy access to capital,\u201d Trainer told Fortune. \u201cThese \u2018zombie\u2019 companies are at risk of going bankrupt.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is another example of the fervor that developed on Wall Street over the past few years. When the cryptocurrency exchange went public in April 2021, shares spiked from their $250 reference price to $381 per share.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, a former hedge fund manager, took to Twitter after the IPO, saying that he \u201cliked Coinbase to $475.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t alone, investment banks\u2019 average price target for the exchange was over $400 per share in early 2021.\n\nSince then, however, Coinbase stock is down more than 90% amid the crypto winter. And Cramer has changed his mind, saying in a December 13 tweet that he was \u201cnot a buyer of Coinbase here,\u201d calling it \u201ctoo early.\u201d\n\nCNBC did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe cheap money era may have led many forecasters to assume that asset prices would continue to soar, regardless of valuations, but this year has proven to be a wake-up call. Wall Street analysts have slashed their price targets for many of the stock market\u2019s pandemic darlings. It\u2019s a new era for markets and forecasters, as Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer of the investment advisory firm CapWealth, told Fortune last month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be unwinding a lot of the speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of revaluation of everything from commercial real estate to how the investing public looks at things like crypto."

        "content": "David Zell is a co-founder of the Bitcoin Policy Institute and Director of Policy at BTC Inc. In this interview, we discuss how the Bitcoin Policy Institute engages to educate politicians in DC through combating FUD, distinguishing Bitcoin from crypto, and aligning Bitcoin with US National Security interests and American values.\n\n- - - -\n\nBitcoin was developed on the shoulders of the cypherpunks building new forms of money outside of government control and oversight. Permission was not sought, as permission would not have been granted. Government actively disrupted the cypherpunk vision, seeking to destroy it. Bitcoin\u2019s emergence was therefore antithetical to the concerns and endorsement of decision-makers.\n\nBut, some believe that the initial battle has been won. Bitcoin is now 14 years old. It has spread to all corners of the globe, and radically changed the mindset of those who have interacted with it. This includes some of those in the corridors of power, who have been won over by its ideology and technical resilience. The question now is how Bitcoin development continues.\n\nBitcoin could continue to evolve without seeking to engage with the levers of the state. Experience suggests that this would marginalise Bitcoin and Bitcoiners within the US. In the meantime, other protocols and blockchains would continue to curry favour with lawmakers and mould the regulatory framework to their needs. Who would win in this situation?\n\nOr, through advocacy and education and cooperation with those in DC, Bitcoin could be allowed to develop openly within the United States. Much like the internet, the risks posed by this new innovation wouldn\u2019t be allowed to throttle the huge benefits it has to offer both individuals and society.\n\nIn a grand scenario, Bitcoin could allow the United States to continue to compete for hegemonic power whilst continuing to champion individual freedom and sovereignty. This is a huge prize. Perhaps the biggest prize. This is why there are people willing to put in the hard graft to develop and nurture bodies like the Bitcoin Policy Institute. The future owes them gratitude."

        "title": "Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: A crypto beginner\u2019s guide to Nonfarm Payrolls and its effects on BTC - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nThe Nonfarm Payrolls announcement is scheduled for January 6 at 13:30 GMT.\n\nThe expectations hover around 200K as compared to the previous month\u2019s 263K.\n\nIf the NFP number comes in higher than expectations, investors can expect a short-term selloff in Bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price and the general crypto markets have been highly correlated with the stock markets since the COVID-19 crash in March 2020. Since then, macroeconomic news have been affecting Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins, and the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) monthly release is one such significant event, with the December version to be published on January 6 at 13:30 GMT.\n\nWhat are Nonfarm Payrolls?\n\nThe Nonfarm Payrolls, also known as NFP, is a measure of the number of workers that are employed during the prior month in the United States (US). The statistic is provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and excludes jobs like farm workers, government workers, private households, proprietors, and non-profit employees.\n\nWhy is NFP important?\n\nAccording to the BLS, the Nonfarm Payrolls number consists of jobs that directly or indirectly contribute roughly 80% to the United States Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Hence, the NFP provides an important assessment of the job landscape and, in turn, gives an outlook of current market conditions.\n\nAdditionally, NFP are also closely scrutinized by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve (Fed), to assess their monetary policy. The Fed does have a double mandate to keep both employment and inflation figures at healthy levels for the economy. Therefore, the measure of the jobs added or lost will set the tone for the upcoming Fed interest rate hike decision.\n\nHere are some quick examples.\n\nInstance 1: If the NFP data for December comes in higher than the prior month, it indicates that more jobs have been added. This is a positive development and will indicate a stronger economy, allowing the US Dollar to strengthen.\n\nA stronger US Dollar is usually negative for the stock market. Hence, a higher Nonfarm Payroll number that exceeds expectations usually causes the stock market to temporarily take a hit. Since the crypto markets have been highly correlated to the traditional markets in recent times, it will likely cause a similar effect on Bitcoin price.\n\nInstance 2: If NFP numbers come in lower than expectations, it may lead to a weaker US Dollar, which will inadvertently cause the stock and crypto markets (including BTC) to rally.\n\nVisualizing crypto vs. NFP\n\nTaking a look at the big picture of Nonfarm Payrolls data vs. Bitcoin price, this provides a generalized view of what has happened so far and what to expect next.\n\nThe chart attached below shows that Bitcoin price has almost always dropped when the actual NFP data has come out higher than expectations or forecasts. The only exceptions can be seen in August and December 2022, where BTC saw a short-term uptick despite the weak NFP numbers.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart vs. NFP\n\nDecember NFP report expectations and ADP\n\nOn January 6, the December Nonfarm Payrolls numbers will be announced at 13:30 GMT and the forecasts hover around 200k. To assess where the NFP numbers will land, investors can take a look at the US Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Employment numbers, which were released on Thursday.\n\nADP tracks the level of nonfarm private employment and is published usually two days before the BLS publishes the NFP numbers \u2013 although this week the data came out on Thursday due to the shortened week on New Year celebrations. Hence, market participants can use ADP to get a basic understanding of what to expect from Nonfarm Payrolls.\n\nAccording to the ADP numbers released on January 5, private employment increased by 235,000 last month as opposed to the expectations of 150,000. Since ADP numbers beat expectations, investors are expecting a similar trend for the NFP.\n\nSo, a higher-than-expected number will be better for the US Dollar, which will negatively impact the stock and cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBitcoin price could tank\n\nBitcoin price is struggling to overcome the resistance level at $16,836, which is the highest volume traded level since November 5. Interestingly, it also coincides with the midpoint of the larger range that BTC has set up, extending from $15,443 to $18,230.\n\nSince the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is already retracing from the overbought zone, the chances that bulls will make a comeback are slim. Additionally, strong NFP numbers will result in a sell-off for BTC.\n\nA breakdown of the $16,000 psychological level could likely result in a sweep of the equal lows at $15,443.\n\nBTC/USDT 12-hour chart\n\nIf the sell-off caused by the announcement of the NFP numbers is followed by a quick rise in buying pressure and a recovery rally, things could favor the bulls. If such a situation happens, the RSI should bounce off the midpoint at 50.\n\nIn such a case, Bitcoin price could bounce off the $16,624 support level and trigger another leg-up to $17,306 and even $18,401.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum price may drop 12% before it reaches $1,300"

        "content": "Welcome to Forkast Forecasts 2023. In this series, leaders, innovators and visionaries in blockchains share their industry predictions for the year ahead.\n\nDennis Jarvis\n\nDennis Jarvis is the Tokyo-based chief executive officer of Bitcoin.com, a Bitcoin exchange and cryptocurrency wallet developer. Previously, Jarvis held global leadership roles at Apple, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten and blockchain startup Orb.\n\nPredictions for 2023\n\nRegulators may tip the scale in DeFi\u2019s favor\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closer now than ever on the DeFi (decentralized finance) side with creating that [user] experience. I\u2019m optimistic that in 2023, we\u2019re going to see this experience gap between what centralized exchanges were able to offer and what decentralized exchanges are able to offer narrow even further. And this is going to be in combination with regulators who may be clamping down where they can on centralized exchanges and CeFi. Hopefully, that\u2019s going to create a tipping point in DeFi\u2019s favor. And it\u2019s up to us in the industry to make sure that we are narrowing that user experience gap, making it as easy as possible for people to explore the world of crypto and to seize control of their own financial future and prosperity and economic freedom with tools that are as easy to use as centralized finance tools were in the past, but for DeFi.\u201d\n\nThe FTX contagion will emphasize the need for DeFi\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the future looks particularly bright for centralized exchanges going into 2023. The fallout from the slew of centralized crypto businesses going insolvent recently is going to continue probably well into next year. There are probably risks of further insolvencies. It\u2019s going to take time for all the opaque dealings of centralized exchanges and businesses to unwind around the failures that happened earlier this year and also more recently with FTX. The businesses that have already declared bankruptcy are going to make their way through that process. It\u2019s going to provide more headlines in the news about how badly they mismanaged their funds. And it\u2019s not going to be great for investors and customers of these companies. But to shine a light on centralized exchanges is a necessary thing for the industry. We\u2019re going to see a lot of centralized institutions say goodbye to their businesses and the ones that remain will probably be stronger and more regulated in the future. But this is really going to emphasize the necessity of DeFi and decentralized exchanges in crypto. And I see this as more of a turn to crypto fundamentals like self-ownership and self-sovereignty over funds.\u201d\n\nThe industry will return to the fundamentals of decentralization\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a welcome reversal of the past few years where massive amounts of money have poured into crypto, but it\u2019s been in centralized custodial solutions and exchanges. The industry has moved away recently from the fundamentals of self-custody, decentralization, censorship, resistance and transparency. This is going to precipitate a shift back to those fundamentals. And this is a great opportunity for everybody in the industry who is focused on DeFi and crypto fundamentals to educate the public, especially people who have joined the space recently about how important it is to be decentralized, to be resistant to censorship and to have sovereignty of your own funds. And in fact, we\u2019re doing that with our centralized exchange education fund, where we\u2019re incentivizing users through our token program to explore the entire world of DeFi.\u201d"

        "content": "During the winter storm in Texas in December 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) mining operators returned up to 1,500 megawatts of energy to the distressed local grid. It became possible due to the flexibility of mining operations and the ancillary services, provided by the state authorities.\n\nIn his commentary to Satoshi Action Fund, Texas Blockchain Council president Lee Bratcher stated that miners returned up to 1,500 megawatts to the Texas grid. This amount of energy would be enough to heat \u201cover 1.5 million small homes or keep 300 large hospitals fully operational,\u201d according to the calculations from the Bitcoin advocacy group.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no specification regarding the exact time period in which miners have accumulated such an amount of power, the global Bitcoin mining hash rate dropped by 30% on Dec. 24-25, 2022. Miners appeared to be the model participants of ancillary services in the state, which stimulates customers to reduce their consumption during peak demand in order to stabilize the grid.\n\nRelated: Public Bitcoin mining companies plagued with $4B of collective debt\n\nThe winter storm in North America was so severe that it shut down Binance\u2019s cloud mining products from Dec. 24-26. During the days leading up to Christmas, a \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d unleashed extreme temperatures across the United States, leaving millions without electricity and claiming dozens of lives.\n\nBack in March 2022, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) established an interim process to ensure that new large loads, such as Bitcoin miners, can be connected to the ERCOT grid. Software providers have also begun working with miners to ensure they have the tools needed to properly enable grid balancing.\n\nWith its 14% share in Bitcoin hash rate, Texas is among the top states for Bitcoin mining in the United States, along with New York (19.9%), Kentucky (18.7%) and Georgia (17.3%)."

Bitcoin peaked at $69,000 last November.\n\nSchiff, a well-known financial analyst and investor, has been very vocal in his criticism of Bitcoin. He believes that cryptocurrency does not have any intrinsic value, as it has yet to prove itself as a safe store of value or currency.\n\nAs reported by U.Today , the gold bug recently warned that Bitcoin was heading to zero.\n\nSchiff is concerned that Bitcoin's lack of tangible utility makes its high market valuation difficult to justify and argues this renders it vulnerable to high volatility.\n\nHis Bitcoin price predictions have been largely inaccurate. In 2018, he predicted that the currency would fall to $1,000 and urged people to sell their Bitcoins before it happened. He also predicted in 2020 that the currency would reach zero. Neither of these predictions came true.\n\nWhile Schiff's forecasts have not been accurate, it should be noted that he was right about the cryptocurrency bubble of 2021 when Bitcoin rose to an all-time high and then crashed soon after. He correctly identified this bubble before it popped, although he failed to predict its effects or exact timing accurately."

        "content": "BlackRock makes bitcoin eligible investment to $15B fund\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is adding bitcoin as an eligible investment to its flagship Global Allocation Fund, which is one of the most preferred vehicles for ordinary and passive investors.\n\nA company filing shows that the move enables BlackRock to allocate part of the fund\u2019s $15 billion to cash-settled bitcoin futures traded on commodity exchanges registered with the CFTC.\n\nGlobal Allocation Fund adopts a fully managed investment policy utilizing U.S. and foreign equity, debt and money market securities, the combination of which are varied from time to time in response to economic trends. In normal market conditions, the primary fund invests at least 70% of its total assets in the securities of corporate and governmental issuers. Based on its past performance, it delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 10.35%, and ranks in the top third among its category peers.\n\n\u201cThe Fund may invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures that are traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,\u201d the filing states.\n\nBlackRock made headlines last year when it added bitcoin futures to derivatives products that two of its funds can invest in. The development came shortly after CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, provided a somewhat bullish take on the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. In a relatively rare endorsement, Fink said Bitcoin has \u2018caught the attention\u2019 and could largely replace gold but warned of its growing popularity that has a real impact on the US dollar.\n\nBack then, Fink, who has grown BlackRock into the world\u2019s largest money-management corporation, dismissed bitcoin as nothing more than a vehicle for speculation and money laundering.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager launched a blockchain-focused ETF in April that provides investors with exposure to the crypto and blockchain industry. The company added the Blockchain and Tech ETF (IBLC) to its iShares product line.\n\nBlackRock had inked a partnership deal with the prime brokerage arm of US popular exchange, Coinbase. The collaboration is, however, limited to bitcoin and will allow BlackRock\u2019s institutional clients to have access to crypto trading, custody, prime brokerage, and reporting via Coinbase Prime. The clients are also able to manage their bitcoin and conduct risk analysis using BlackRock\u2019s software suite Aladdin.\n\nBlackRock also participated in $400 million funding round for Boston-based fintech startup Circle. In addition to its investment and role as a primary asset manager of USDC cash reserves, BlackRock entered into a partnership with Circle to explore capital market applications for its stablecoin."

        "content": "TOKYO -- The price for graphics cards -- a computer component crucial for data-intensive activities like gaming -- has dropped about 60% from a 2021 peak amid a slowdown in cryptocurrency mining.\n\nAn extensive array of graphics cards lined the shelves at Dospara, a computer parts store in the capital's Akihabara electronics district, in early December. Back in early 2021, those same shelves would have stood empty.\n\nGraphics cards on average sold for 18,737 yen ($144) at online auctions in November, down roughly 60% from May 2021, according to price comparison platform Aucfan. The number of cards sold at auction also fell about 40% over the same period to 5,379.\n\nThe average price for graphics cards came to 66,300 yen in November, according to Tokyo-based research company BCN. While the figure has been creeping up with the launch of new higher-end products, it is still about 20% below the recent high from June 2021.\n\nGraphics cards, which contain graphics processing units (GPUs), are what allow computers to produce detailed, smooth images. They are critical to activities like gaming and video editing.\n\nGraphics cards at Dospara's main branch in Akihabara in December 2022. (Photo by Hiroki Masuda)\n\nTheir ability to process high volumes of calculations at once also make them well-suited for mining cryptocurrency, which involves solving complex puzzles. Surging cryptocurrency prices in 2021 fueled greater demand for GPUs, which ate into the availability of the components for those building custom computers at home.\n\n\"Graphics cards were no longer reaching our intended gaming audience, especially at the beginning of 2021,\" said the Japanese unit of GPU supplier Nvidia.\n\nNvidia responded by producing GPUs with lower hash rates, which makes them less efficient at mining, since launching the GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card in February 2021. It launched products specifically designed for mining at the same time.\n\nBut cryptocurrencies have since plunged. One bitcoin was worth around $17,000 as of late December, according to CoinDesk -- around 80% below the record high from November 2021. Ethereum was also down about 80%.\n\nSoaring energy prices have further weighed on mining operations, which are extremely power intensive.\n\n\"There's little payoff for miners right now, with cryptocurrencies losing value even as the costs of mining them increase,\" said Takeshi Kamada, an executive officer at price comparison website Kakaku.com.\n\nThe concept of mining itself faces growing criticism on environmental grounds. Ethereum -- the main driver behind crypto-related GPU demand, according to Nvidia -- switched to a mechanism that eliminated the need for mining in September. A scaling back of cryptocurrency mining means the industry will have less of an impact on the market for graphics cards.\n\nThose on the sales floor express relief over the shift.\n\n\"I've seen firsthand how incoming shipments have become more stable,\" said Shoki Hisasue, who manages Dospara's Akihabara store. \"We can recommend multiple options to gamers and video creators who come here, which makes our job easier.\"\n\nA representative at another computer parts store said, \"People who genuinely enjoy computer gaming can buy graphics cards now.\"\n\nThe mining boom had hampered growth in the PC games market.\n\nThe global game market will expand by about 10% from 2022 to 2025 to $211.2 billion, according to Dutch research company Newzoo International."

        "title": "Bitcoin's annualized 3-month futures basis show a calm before the storm - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Out of all the crypto derivative products, perpetual futures have emerged as a preferred instrument for market speculation. Bitcoin traders use the instrument en masse for risk hedging and capturing funding rate premiums.\n\nPerpetual futures, or perpetual swaps as they\u2019re sometimes referred to, are futures contracts with no expiration date. Those holding perpetual contracts are able to buy or sell the underlying asset at an unspecified point in the future. The price of the contract remains the same as the underlying asset\u2019s spot rate on the contract\u2019s opening date.\n\nTo keep the contract\u2019s price close to the spot price as time goes by, exchanges implement a mechanism called a crypto funding rate. The funding rate is a small percentage of a position\u2019s value that must be paid or received from a counterparty at regular intervals, usually every few hours.\n\nA positive funding rate shows that the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the spot rate, indicating higher demand. When the demand is high, buy contracts (longs) pay funding fees to the sell contracts (shorts), incentivizing opposing positions and bringing the contract\u2019s price closer to the spot rate.\n\nWhen the funding rate is negative, sell contracts pay the funding fee to the long contracts, again pushing the contract\u2019s price closer to the spot rate.\n\nGiven the size of both the expiring and the perpetual futures market, comparing the two can show the broader market sentiment when it comes to future price movements.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s annualized 3-month futures basis compares the annualized rates of return available in a cash-and-carry trade between 3-month expiring futures and perpetual funding rates.\n\nCryptoSlate analysis of this metric shows that the perpetual futures\u2019 basis is significantly more volatile than that of expiring futures. The discrepancy between the two is a result of increased demand for leverage in the market. Traders seem to be looking for a financial instrument that tracks spot market price indexes more closely, and perpetual futures match their needs perfectly.\n\nPeriods where the perpetual futures\u2019 basis trades lower than the 3-month expiring futures basis have historically occurred after sharp price declines. Large derisking events such as bull market corrections or prolonged bearish slumps are often followed by a decrease in the perpetual future basis.\n\nOn the other hand, having the perpetual futures basis trade higher than the 3-month expiring futures basis show high demand for leverage in the market. This creates an oversupply of sell-side contracts that lead to price slumps, as traders act fast to arbitrage down the high funding rates.\n\nLooking at the chart above shows that both Bitcoin expiring futures and perpetual swaps were trading in a state of backwardation during the FTX collapse.\n\nBackwardation is a state in which the price of a futures contract is lower than the spot price of its underlying asset. It occurs when the demand for an asset gets higher than the demand for contracts maturing in the coming months.\n\nAs such, backwardation is a pretty rare sight in the derivatives market. During the collapse of FTX, expiring futures were trading at an annualized basis of -0.3%, while perpetual swaps were trading on an annualized basis of -2.5%.\n\nThe only similar periods of backwardation were seen in September 2020, the summer of 2021 following the China mining ban, and July 2020. These were periods of extreme volatility and were dominated by shorts. All of these periods of backwardation saw the market hedged towards the downside and preparing for further slumps.\n\nHowever, every period of backwardation was followed by a price rally. Upward price action began in October 2020 and peaked in April 2021. July 2021 was spent in the red and was followed by a rally that continued well into December 2021. The Terra collapse in June 2022 saw a rally in late summer that lasted until the end of September.\n\nThe vertical price drop caused by the FTX collapse brought on backwardation that looks eerily similar to the previously recorded periods. If historical patterns were to repeat, the market could see positive price action in the coming months.\n\nBitcoin Market Data At the time of press 12:01 pm UTC on Jan. 7, 2023, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 1.06% over the past 24 hours.

        "content": "Bitcoin Gold is an experimental fork of Bitcoin that aims to simplify and decentralize Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin Gold shares many of the same fundamental principles as Bitcoin, like a finite supply. However, the project differentiates itself from Bitcoin by implementing a unique equihash proof-of-work consensus mechanism that favors GPU mining rigs. It makes Bitcoin Gold\u2019s mining process far more accessible and straightforward for the general public than Bitcoin and is one of the features that miners love about Bitcoin Gold.\n\nThe Bitcoin Gold vision is to advance the crypto industry by providing a blockchain similar to Bitcoin that facilitates an open environment for new developers and technologies. By lowering the barriers of entry associated with Bitcoin mining, the Bitcoin Gold blockchain offers users a more accessible crypto mining experience. But what is Bitcoin Gold\u2019s token, BTG?\n\nBTG is the native token of the Bitcoin Gold blockchain. It can be used as a currency of exchange and is used to pay transaction fees and secure the network.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Gold: Key Points\n\nBitcoin Gold is an experimental network seeking to make mining more accessible\n\nBitcoin Gold\u2019s unique consensus mechanism favors GPU mining, as opposed to the highly specified ASIC mining used by Bitcoin miners\n\nGPU mining makes BTG mining possible for anyone. It helps to restore network decentralization\n\nBTG can be traded as a digital asset, used as a currency in exchange for goods and services, and is required to pay transaction fees on the Bitcoin Gold blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Gold is a hard fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Gold Work?\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of what Bitcoin Gold is, let\u2019s take a look at how Bitcoin Gold works. The Bitcoin Gold network is powered by its own equihash proof-of-work consensus mechanism. While this is very similar to the original proof-of-work model made famous by the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the equihash model has its own distinct features.\n\nBitcoin Gold\u2019s specialized equihash consensus model links block processing and throughput to the available storage memory of the computing infrastructure. This results in hash power being directly affected by the memory size of the miner. In simple terms, this completely levels the playing field and effectively means that powerful ASIC mining rigs have no competitive advantage over standard GPU processors.\n\nThis technology reinforces Bitcoin Gold\u2019s goal of \u2018making Bitcoin decentralized again.\u2019 Bitcoin Gold makes mining accessible to everyone, much like Bitcoin mining was initially intended to be before powerful miners monopolized it.\n\nBitcoin Gold also boasts certain privacy features that set the network apart from Bitcoin. Unlike most other blockchains, Bitcoin Gold aims to increase anonymity on the network by omitting transaction details when broadcasting transactions to the blockchain.\n\nBTG Pay\n\nBTG Pay is an additional program provided by the Bitcoin Gold team. BTG Pay is a complete crypto payments solution for e-commerce businesses that allows online retailers to accept payments using the Bitcoin Gold network.\n\nThe BTG Pay program allows buyers to pay for goods using crypto. BTG pay benefits from seamless integration with common eCommerce platforms like Woocommerce, Prestashop, and Magento, facilitating fast international payments at minimal transaction fees.\n\nHow Is BTG Used\n\nBTG is primarily used as a digital currency and asset. It means it can be exchanged for goods and services or held as an investment. BTG is widely supported and listed on over 75 popular cryptocurrency exchanges. As the native token of the Bitcoin Gold blockchain, BTG is used daily to process transactions and secure the network. E-commerce merchants can also use it to accept crypto payments using BTG Pay.\n\nAccording to the last Bitcoin Gold roadmap update, the team plans to make the BTG token interoperable and bring cross-chain functionality to the network. It would open BTG to a world of possibilities in the realm of decentralized finance, with the team aiming to get BTG listed on lending platforms like AAVE.\n\nBitcoin Gold History\n\nBitcoin Gold was initially founded in 2017 to create a more democratic and decentralized mining environment. The original founding team is composed of 6 integral members led by Hang Yin and Jack Liao.\n\nThe launch of the Bitcoin Gold blockchain was anything but smooth. On the day of the network\u2019s launch, the chain was victim to a coordinated DDOS attack on its cloud site. To make matters worse, early BTG miners accused the team of not communicating the network\u2019s 0.5% mining fees. It tied in with initial concerns that Bitcoin Gold\u2019s source code was not as secure as the team had claimed and was vulnerable to exploits.\n\nFortunately, these concerns were unfounded, and the Bitcoin Gold blockchain has remained secure since its launch. Bitcoin Gold has since enjoyed steady growth and stable price action and has remained in the coveted top 100 cryptocurrency list. It has been listed on over 75 exchanges across the industry.\n\nBitcoin Gold Tokenomics\n\nLike Bitcoin, the BTG token has a maximum total supply of 21 million tokens. Of this total supply, there are roughly 17 million currently circulating. It equates to approximately 80.95% of the total supply.\n\nAfter Bitcoin was initially hard forked at the genesis of the Bitcoin Gold network, the development team was permitted to mine around 8000 blocks at an increased rate to manage a founders allocation of BTG. It resulted in 0.476% of the total supply being held by the team and vested over a three year schedule. The team\u2019s token supply (as per the Bitcoin Gold Whitepaper) is to be allocated as follows:\n\nDevelopment - 30%\n\nYearly Expenses - 20%\n\nEcosystem - 15%\n\nCommunity - 15%\n\nBounties and app collaboration - 7%\n\nPre-fork costs - 5%\n\nInitial reward for a core team - 5%\n\nCommunity development - 3%\n\nHow Is BTG Mined?\n\nBitcoin Gold is mined through the network\u2019s equihash proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Like popular proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, miners compete against each other to solve complex problems to produce new blocks and earn tokens through mining rewards.\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin Gold unique is that the equihash consensus model is memory intensive instead of requiring immense volumes of computational power. The result of this feature is that ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining rigs don\u2019t have any mining advantage over GPU miners. It brings balance to the Bitcoin Gold mining environment allowing anyone with a personal computer and a dedicated graphics card effectively mine BTG.\n\nBy reviewing data provided by Messari, the Bitcoin Gold mining schedule will be completed far quicker than that of its parent project, Bitcoin. All BTG tokens are expected to be thoroughly mined and distributed by July 2027, when the total supply of BTG tokens will be fully circulating.\n\nBitcoin Gold vs. Other Forks\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about Bitcoin Gold is that while it\u2019s a hard fork of the original Bitcoin network, it\u2019s not exactly a direct competitor to the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. To better understand Bitcoin Gold's competitors, let\u2019s look at the other dominant Bitcoin forks.\n\nBitcoin Gold vs. Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that facilitates electronic payments. The basis for Bitcoin Cash was born when users realized that Bitcoin itself was rather impractical to use and didn\u2019t scale well due to its high fees and low transaction throughput. Bitcoin Cash has since enjoyed widespread adoption and is commonly used as a currency of exchange. It is one of the select few cryptocurrencies fully supported for transactions by Paypal.\n\nBitcoin Gold vs. Bitcoin SV\n\nLike Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV also aims to provide users with a fast, permissionless decentralized network that permits electronic payments. Despite what many investors think, Bitcoin SV is not a fork of Bitcoin itself but a fork of Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin SV has taken Bitcoin Cash\u2019s plan of scaling the original network and making it even faster and more affordable. While Bitcoin Cash can process around 100 transactions per second, Bitcoin SV bypasses artificial block size limits and can process up to 10,000 transactions per second.\n\nHow Is Bitcoin Gold Different From Other Bitcoin Forks?\n\nWhile Bitcoin Gold cannot boast its competitors' scalability and power, this is irrelevant because the network is focused on achieving different goals. But how does Bitcoin Gold distinguish itself from other Bitcoin forks?\n\nBitcoin Gold isn\u2019t seeking to provide an alternative payment network through scalability, it\u2019s trying to re-democratize mining rewards. While it may be smaller and less adopted than its competitors, Bitcoin Gold has different objectives. If Bitcoin Gold can deliver on its promises of interoperability and cross-chain functionality outlined in its roadmap, it will prove to be more versatile than its competitors.\n\nBitcoin Gold - Partnerships & Investors\n\nIn the spirit of full decentralization, Bitcoin Gold didn\u2019t have any private token sales or seed rounds for initial fundraising. It can be seen as a double-edged sword for the Bitcoin Gold team. The lack of institutional investors means the team has greater flexibility and creative freedom to expand the vision of the Bitcoin Gold project. However, it also means they don\u2019t have institutional support and a sizeable financial warchest that experienced investment firms often provide.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t stopped Bitcoin Gold from securing excellent strategic partnerships. In March 2020, the Bitcoin Gold team announced they\u2019d established an alliance with Latium, an international freelance network. It resulted in the BTG token being supported and accepted as a means of payment on the Latium platform. It brought further utility to the BTG token and is one of the reasons that freelancers are excited about Bitcoin Gold.\n\nBitcoin Gold - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats\n\nStrengths\n\nBitcoin Gold\u2019s greatest strength lies in its accessibility. Bitcoin Gold has grown a passionate and diverse community by lowering the entry barrier to mining BTG tokens without needing competitive mining equipment. Further, because BTG mining is not power intensive, miners are less incentivized to immediately sell their tokens to pay high setup and operational costs. It, in turn, reduces sell pressure and helps stabilize the BTG token's demand-supply mechanics.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnfortunately, the Bitcoin Gold network is not built to process a high amount of transactions rapidly and will be inhibited by scalability issues. Compared to alternative Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold cannot handle the same levels of transaction throughput and will fail to support mass adoption until this is addressed.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe features mentioned in the roadmap for further project development will likely increase the adoption of BTG. Cross-chain compatibility is essential in today\u2019s cryptocurrency industry. If the Bitcoin Gold team can successfully make the token interoperable and deploy it on other blockchains, BTG can be used in existing dApps like AAVE. It will bring better utility and adoption to BTG and distinguish it from its competitors.\n\nThreats\n\nDelayed development and infrequent updates could cripple the Bitcoin Gold project. The team has ambitious plans outlined in their roadmap, such as their goal to deploy BTG as an ERC-20 token. The Crypto industry moves incredibly quickly, and teams that fail to meet deadlines can easily get left behind. To stay relevant, the Bitcoin Gold development team needs to keep on top of its roadmap and continue to deliver on promises.\n\nBitcoin Gold Roadmap\n\nThe Bitcoin Gold roadmap underwent a significant overhaul in April 2021, with the development outlining ambitious long-term goals for the project's future. But what will this change, and what is Bitcoin Gold working on?\n\nThe development team recognizes that Bitcoin Gold needs to diversify its offering beyond being a simple Bitcoin fork. The roadmap reflects this, with a focus on four key development areas in the Bitcoin Gold ecosystem:\n\nInteroperability\n\nApplications\n\nInfrastructure\n\nL2 Lightning Network\n\nBitcoin Gold Updates, News, and Highlights\n\nIn the spirit of increasing Bitcoin Gold\u2019s interoperability and utility, the Bitcoin Gold team announced an impressive partnership that will significantly expand the potential use cases of BTG.\n\nIn March 2021, the Bitcoin Gold team announced that they\u2019d partner with Phala Network to develop cross-chain bridges with the PolkaDot ecosystem. Phala Network is a cloud-computing and privacy solution that runs on a PolkaDot parachain. It means that Phala Network is perfectly placed to liaise with the Bitcoin Gold team and facilitate the development of an affordable, trustless bridge.\n\nBTG will be the first crypto asset to be supported via this bridge, but other popular digital assets like Litecoin, Doge, and Bitcoin Cash will also be implemented. It will effectively bring over $36 billion of market value into the PolkaDot ecosystem, led by Bitcoin Gold.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Gold\u2019s Lightning Network?\n\nOne of the key flaws that hold the Bitcoin Gold network back from widespread adoption is that, compared to other Bitcoin forks, it is plagued by scalability issues. Bitcoin Gold suffers from low transaction throughput and slow processing times. So what is Bitcoin Gold doing to resolve this problem?\n\nIn response to these issues, the Bitcoin Gold team has been tinkering with deploying their own layer 2 lightning network. This layer 2 scaling solution proposes a new method to send peer-to-peer electronic transactions. In theory, lightning network transactions through direct payment channels between wallets. Blockchain smart contracts still process these payments, meaning they maintain reliability and trust. However, because payments don\u2019t need to wait for blockspace to be processed, they are instantaneous.\n\nBitcoin Gold\u2019s Lightning Network would also benefit from micro-cost transactions. Because transactions aren\u2019t reliant on being processed via the blockchain and instead pass through direct payment channels, network congestion and gas spikes are not an issue. While setting up an initial channel may incur some gas fees, users can send payments directly with micro fees once the channel is operational.\n\nWhere To Buy BTG?\n\nNow that you\u2019ve learned all there is to know about Bitcoin Gold, the next question is where to buy BTG.\n\nFortunately, OKX is the best place to buy BTG. We provide deep liquidity and high volume markets with a variety of BTG trading pairs that allow you to buy BTG instantly with minimum slippage. To buy BTG, head to the OKX Spot Market and bring up a BTG trading pair using the search function.\n\nHow To Store BTG?\n\nMany Bitcoin Gold investors like to store their BTG tokens using Bitcoin Gold\u2019s dedicated crypto wallet. Using the Bitcoin Gold Core Wallet, users are also running a validator node which helps power the chain and improve network security.\n\nYou can also store your tokens right here on OKX. Every OKX account is complete with a unique cryptocurrency wallet. Our cold wallet architecture boasts state-of-the-art security feature to protect your BTG well.\n\nAnother popular option with experienced cryptocurrency investors is storing your BTG tokens using a reputable hardware wallet. Famous hardware wallets companies like Ledger and Trezor offer top-tier security for digital assets.\n\nFAQs About Bitcoin Gold\n\nWhat Is Unique About Bitcoin Gold?\n\nBitcoin Gold is unique due to its dedicated equihash proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This consensus model aims to democratize and balance BTG mining across the network, by removing the barriers to entry usually associated with token mining. With Bitcoin Gold, anyone with a personal computer can mine BTG, and you don\u2019t need specialized mining equipment.\n\nWhere Can I Stake Bitcoin Gold?\n\nIt is currently impossible to stake BTG tokens for passive income. BTG has a fixed supply, meaning there are no inflationary staking mechanisms. The team may offer some staking utility in the future as the Bitcoin Gold network grows; however, BTG offers no staking services at this point.\n\nHow Can I Get Started Mining Bitcoin Gold?\n\nTo start mining Bitcoin Gold, you only need a computer with a suitable graphics card. After reading the mining tutorial provided by the Bitcoin Gold site, simply install the mining software onto your computer and join a mining pool to start earning mining rewards.\n\nHow Much Capital Do I Need To Start Investing in Bitcoin Gold?\n\nWith OKX, you can start investing in Bitcoin Gold for as little as $1. When trading BTG in the OKX Spot Market, you can place buy orders for a minimum of 0.01 BTG. OKX makes it easy to invest in Bitcoin Gold no matter your budget.\n\nWhat Is BTG\u2019s Maximum Supply?\n\nBecause Bitcoin Gold is a hard fork of the original Bitcoin, it features many similarities, like token supply. BTG has a maximum total supply of 21 million BTG; these tokens are slowly released over time through BTG token mining and are expected to be fully mined in July 2027."

        "content": "Since the beginning of the new year, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed some short-term gains, however, the market value of the flagship cryptocurrency continues to languish below important support levels. The BTC price has battled to remain above $17,000 for a number of weeks now, but hasn\u2019t been able to break the resistance and recently fell below the $ 16,900 mark for the first time in almost two months.\n\nBitcoin Still Not Bottomed\n\nThe struggle doesn\u2019t end here as Bitcoin may still be able to reach much lower prices in the future. Data from CryptoQuant, suggests that the price hasn\u2019t bottomed out yet as many were expecting. During positive crypto market cycles, the price usually remains higher than the realized price. On the other hand, as a bear market is nearing its final capitulation phase, the price falls below the realized price, causing widespread panic.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRealized Price is the measure of the average price weighted by the supply of what the entire market participants paid for their coins. It can be interpreted as an on-chain support or resistance price and is calculated as realized cap divided by the total coin supply.\n\nFurthermore, during this period, market players are under a great deal of stress, and as a result, they sell off their assets in order to prevent more losses and control their exposure to further crypto market changes. Now, looking at previous cycles, the beginning of a bull market can be predicted by the BTC price outdoing the realized price. However, this has not yet occurred, as the price has been unable to break above a certain price point and recently got rejected to the downside with significant bearish momentum.\n\nRead More: Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price To Remain Bearish?\n\nAs a result, there is still room for Bitcoin to fall, and the end of the current bear market won\u2019t be expected until the price surpasses the realized price, which is presently at $19.7K. Until then, the negative trend is expected to continue.\n\nAs things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $16,970. This represents an increase of 0.82% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 2.07% during the week as per CoinGape\u2019s crypto market tracker.\n\nAlso Read: Solana\u2019s BONK Crashes By Nearly 40%; Is The Bull Run Finally Over?"

        "title": "The struggle for the true Bitcoin: BTC, BCH or BSV - CoinGeek",
        "content": "In a previous article titled, Who is trying to control, manipulate or destroy Bitcoin?, Marquez Comelab discussed the different groups of people who have different incentives to influence Bitcoin, take it over, control it, or make it their own. Here, he tells the story of how varying factions struggled to control Bitcoin and, in the process, created three implementations of Bitcoin: Core (BTC), Cash (BCH), and Satoshi Vision (BSV), each one claiming to be the true Bitcoin.\n\nCore (BTC): Small blocks vs big blocks\n\nIn 2017, it became increasingly evident that BTC was unfit to deal with the challenges of being a global currency. It could only handle a maximum of seven transactions per second. The network quickly became congested. People had to wait days or weeks for their transactions to be processed.\n\nThis performance limit results from BTC having only a 1 megabyte block size limit coded into the Bitcoin software. People who had a stake in Bitcoin\u2019s future have been aware of this looming problem. Satoshi Nakamoto added this limit to deal with the possibility of spam transactions being sent to the network in its early years. However, he was explicitly clear that the limit should be removed before the network reached capacity. He even provided a guideline on how this could be done. As the network reached full capacity the protocol engineers that maintained the Bitcoin code refused to remove the block size limit. There was a stalemate.\n\nSince around 2015, discussions and views began to diverge: some argued to keep the block size as is, and others claimed to enlarge it. This is called the \u201cScaling Debate\u201d; the two groups were called the Big Blockers and the Small Blockers.\n\nThe Big Blockers argued that Satoshi had already provided a way to solve the issue: to enlarge the block size and enable Bitcoin to process more transactions as people adopted and used it. Prominent Big Blockers include Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, Calvin Ayre and Dr. Craig Wright.\n\nThe Small Blockers were people who argued that the way to deal with the transaction congestion problem was to change Satoshi\u2019s protocol design so it can include other third party scaling solutions. An example of such a third party scaling solution is called the Lightning Network. For Lightning Network to facilitate working with Bitcoin, the Small Blockers wanted to modify the Bitcoin protocol to implement a change called \u201cSegwit.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the Lightning Network was still very much experimental, and Segwit alone was certainly not enough to solve the congestion issue. Big Blockers, like Roger Ver, wondered why it was not considered to simply enlarge the size of the blocks until a better solution was ready. It seemed, however, that the Small Blockers were trying to solve the congestion problem more complex than it needed to be.\n\nMany Big Blockers distrusted the true intentions and incentives of the Small Blockers. One reason was that the Small Blockers censored the discussions about how to best scale Bitcoin, which they argued stifled the right of others to hear all available information and to arrive at a consensus. For example:\n\nSmall Blockers were censoring discussions about the scaling issue on websites like Reddit, where people gather and discuss all things Bitcoin.\n\nWhen Brian Armstrong, chief executive officer of Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), posted his support for bigger blocks in 2016, Small Blockers removed Coinbase as a recommended wallet on the Bitcoin.Org website, a site originally set up by Satoshi Nakamoto to provide information about Bitcoin.\n\nEven more serious consideration is the connection between the most influential Small Blockers, the centralized BTC Core developers, who have the monopoly on the BTC protocol, and a company called Blockstream. In 2014, a few protocol engineers like Pieter Wuille and Gregory Maxwell formed a company called Blockstream, along with Adam Back. Blockstream created proprietary bolt on solutions that catered to the perceived inadequacies of Bitcoin. Their products are only justified if BTC had high transaction fees which small blocks insured. Major incumbent financial organizations like AXA also fund them employing many BTC developers.\n\nMany Big Blockers suspected Bitcoin had been captured by the industry it sought to disrupt. By keeping the block size small, the BTC core developers were intentionally crippling Bitcoin\u2019s ability to process transactions. For what possible reason? So, they could profit by providing their solutions to a problem that they allowed and continued to perpetuate for their own financial gain or for the gain of others. Whether Blockstream was set up for this purpose did not matter. As long as this conflict of interest exists, Small Blockers associated with Blockstream and those invested in Second-Layer solutions are incentivized to keep Bitcoin blocks small. When an incentive exists, it is bound to be exploited.\n\nBTC forks away from Bitcoin protocol\n\nIn 2017, the Small Blockers were scheduled to implement a protocol change called Segwit on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Big Blockers wanted to avoid Segwit. So on August 1, 2017, the Small Blockers \u201cforked\u201d Bitcoin and kept the ticker BTC to represent their new blockchain protocol.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin, the protocol and the blockchain (the record of all transactions) have been duplicated, but as they march forward in time, the two blockchains will diverge as they begin to record a different set of transactions. The Small Blockers continued to work on the BTC blockchain and implement Segwit, and the origin Bitcoin blockchain started being referred to by Big Blockers as Bitcoin Cash which used the ticker symbol BCH.\n\nAfter the fork, the Big Blockers had a more significant challenge than the Small Blockers. The Small Blockers\u2019 chain kept the original ticker (BTC). As a result, people continued treating it as though it was more Bitcoin than Bitcoin Cash. By default, all the exchanges, apps, and wallets remained connected to BTC as they always have. Bitcoin Cash had to start its application layer practically from scratch.\n\nSetting the Bitcoin protocol in stone\n\nA year after the BTC forked off Bitcoin, another issue began dividing the Big Blockers. BCH developers proposed changes that seemed to focus on changing how the transactions were sorted on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, certain members of the Big Blockers, like Calvin Ayre and Dr. Craig Wright, became increasingly suspicious of the motives behind the proposed changes. They argued that Bitcoin should focus on scaling and follow a more aggressive approach towards enlarging the block size limit and eventually removing it so it can handle the transaction volumes required by the entire planet.\n\nUnlike the BTC-BCH split, when people were divided over how big the block size should be, people in the Big Blocks camp were divided between those who wished to continue making significant changes to the Bitcoin protocol, and those who wanted to restore it to the original version that Satoshi Nakamoto released in 2009. The latter group believed and was confident that the Bitcoin Whitepaper and Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s protocol always had what was needed for Bitcoin to achieve its objective of becoming cash for the world.\n\nBCH forks away from the Bitcoin protocol\n\nNakamoto Consensus. In Bitcoin, this is called a \u201chash war.\u201d The miners headed by Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright were up against miners led by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. The war cost millions of dollars on both sides. On November 15, 2018, Bitcoin took the new ticker BSV and Roger Ver and Jihan Wu forked off the original Bitcoin creating a brand new protocol but kept the BCH ticker symbol on exchanges.\n\nThe Vision\n\nThe Satoshi Vision implementation of the Bitcoin protocol (BSV) focused on restoring the original scripting language op codes that were removed by BTC developers. The focus was to continue developing Bitcoin as described in the Bitcoin white paper. Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright had grown restless with the tendency of developers to keep tinkering with the Bitcoin protocol. They committed to undo all the changes developers made to the Bitcoin code over the years and have it rewritten to resemble, as close as possible, the original Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol would then be \u201cset in stone,\u201d just as Nakamoto believed it should be. Before Satoshi seemingly vanished, he wrote: \u201cThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.\u201d\n\nIn numerous presentations, BSV entrepreneur Jimmy Nguyen, who is a significant voice of those supporting Bitcoin SV, points out that it is not feasible for giant corporations, governments, and other organizations to build on Bitcoin if the protocol keeps changing. He likened the Bitcoin protocol to the Internet protocol. The Internet Protocol may not be perfect and can be improved like everything else. But because it is a fundamental foundation of the Internet on which millions of websites are built, it is most critical for it to be stable. Everyone else can develop on top of it, adjusting for whatever weaknesses it has. Let us stop tinkering with Bitcoin and let us begin professionalizing it.\n\nCraig Wright also emphasizes that for something to become as important as a global currency, it must be decentralized.\n\nDecentralization refers to the concept of control. If developers are allowed to keep changing the Bitcoin protocol, then they have control over it. Keeping the Bitcoin software/protocol permanent and \u201cset-in-stone\u201d denies anyone the opportunity to control Bitcoin. Ensuring this is done is how decentralization of control is achieved in Bitcoin.\n\nIn February 2020, in the \u201cGenesis\u201d upgrade, BSV developers returned the Bitcoin protocol as closely as possible to the original release in 2009 by Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the distinctions between the three projects identifying themselves as Bitcoin are the following:\n\nBTC adherents are following a path where they hope to sell and profit from second-layer solutions to the world.\n\nBCH adherents are still chasing ambitions of becoming an anonymous superior cash system. However, like BTC, their developers are still making changes to their protocol.\n\nBSV adherents believe that Bitcoin should follow the vision and description set forth by its inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, and have shown their commitment to this belief by restoring the Bitcoin Protocol to the original protocol 2009, and \u2018set it in stone\u2019. Their convictions are proving to be correct.\n\nIn September 2022, more than two years after BCH forked away from Bitcoin, BSV extended the recommended block size limit to four gigabytes. That is 4,000 times bigger than BTC\u2019s block size of 1MB. It has also processed 23 times more transactions per day (6,735,600 transactions) than BTC (290,702) and 267 times more than BCH (25,150).\n\nThe superiority of Bitcoin SV\u2019s ability to process large volumes of transactions is a testament to the guiding principles of Satoshi\u2019s vision for Bitcoin that the BSV supporters have committed to fulfilling.\n\nTo the builders\u2026 To the developers\u2026 To those with a vision of a better future\u2026@BitcoinAssn @nChainGlobal and all of us are going to ensure that you have the platform to transform the world.

        "title": "The Surprisingly Simple Way To Steal Cryptocurrency - Hackaday",
        "content": "In the news a few days ago, the revelation that Luke Dashjr, a core Bitcoin developer, had his wallet compromised, and lost 200 BTC. A small fortune, and something of a shock. I\u2019m guessing that someone with that expertise would not have left his private key lying around, so as a cryptocurrency non-enthusiast I\u2019m left curious as to how the attackers might have done it. So I phoned a few friends who do walk those paths for an explanation, and the result was a fascinating conversation or two. The most probable answer is still that someone broke into his computer and copied the keys \u2014 straight-up computer theft. But there\u2019s another possible avenue that doesn\u2019t involve stealing anything, and is surprisingly simple.\n\nAre You A Gambler, Or An Engineer?\n\nI\u2019m guessing that most Hackaday readers will know something about how a blockchain works, and also how public-key cryptography works. Public-key cryptography is key to the security of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, with the key that unlocks all your wealth for you being your private key and the key which allows transactions to be made with you by other people being your public key.\n\nIf you want to send some cryptocurrency to someone else, you encrypt the transaction using their public key which is as its name suggests, public, and your private key which is known only to you. Thus it\u2019s important that your private key is kept really private, because if someone finds it they control your stash of cryptocurrency. So to steal all those bitcoins someone had his private key, an eventuality that should never have happened. We can safely assume that his protection of the key was as good as it gets, so further assuming that nobody physically stole his hardware wallet or whatever he kept it on, his key was compromised by other means.\n\nThe true security of public-key cryptography lies in it being extremely difficult to guess an individual\u2019s private key. A brute-force algorithm to guess Luke Dashjr\u2019s private key would require unimaginable computing power over a geological-level timespan, thus it\u2019s also safe to assume that nobody set their computer to guessing his key alone. At this point, it\u2019s helpful to stop thinking like an engineer, and start thinking like a gambler. An engineer calculates the time required to brute force Luke Dashjr\u2019s private key, but a gambler throws the dice and sees if the throw generates any money.\n\nThinking from a gambler\u2019s perspective, what are the dice, and how likely is a throw to win? If you roll the dice by guessing a private key at random and try it against Luke Dashjr\u2019s stash of Bitcoin alone, then you\u2019re in the same area as the engineer waiting geological time for your computer to crack it. But if you\u2019re a gambler, you don\u2019t care about Luke Dashjr or anyone else, you\u2019re simply interested in the keys to any wallet with some Bitcoin in it. At this point the odds against you come down enormously, because instead of one chance with Luke Dashjr, you have a whole blockchain\u2019s worth of possibilities for a match.\n\nHow To Steal 200 BTC By Brute Force\n\nSo here\u2019s how it works. The blockchain contains the public keys of all its participants, everyone who has, or has had, Bitcoin. You collect that list, which is quite large, and hold onto it. Then you roll the dice, by generating a random private key. From that private key you generate the corresponding public key, and check whether it\u2019s in the list of public keys on the blockchain. If it matches, you empty the wallet connected with it; if not, you repeat the process by generating another key. By not focusing on a particular individual account, you\u2019ve reduced the time you\u2019ll have to wait to crack any account from a geological aeon to a much more manageable figure. My friends suggested that it might be possible to find something in the order of months if they had enough resources.\n\nAs the title says then, it\u2019s a surprisingly simple way to steal cryptocurrency. But simple doesn\u2019t mean that the attack makes economic sense. Guessing key pairs requires significant resources and time, and you have to weigh this against the chances of finding a whale with boatloads of Bitcoin versus the chance of finding an account with a couple bucks left in it, which would sting after having invested millions into computer time. Doing this seriously is a gamble, and thankfully for the integrity of Bitcoin, probably a bad bet. But who knows? People do play the lottery.\n\nIf you want to roll the bones yourself, there is even a handy proof of concept in the form of keys.lol, the product of Sjors Ottjes, a Dutch web developer. This site displays a range of keys and queries the Bticoin and Ethereum blockchains to see if they match anything. You\u2019ll soon see the scale of the task as you load random pages, and it\u2019s safe to say that the chances of loading a page with a valid key on it are very small indeed.\n\nIf you hold Bitcoin, you should at least think about the brute force attack. But it doesn\u2019t concern us \u2014 our wealth is held in unobtainable semiconductor devices stashed in a safety deposit box.\n\nHeader image: Ralf Roletschek, CC BY-SA 3.0."

        "content": "M\ufeffore than any other financial product, cryptocurrency had its time in the sun in 2022.\n\nFrom fuelling a white-hot NFT market to \ufeffrivalling gold as a \"safe haven\" asset during multiple COVID-19 pandemics, many believed that cryptocurrency had reached a level of legitimacy that would give it staying power.\n\nThen it appeared the market had spent too much time in the sun.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Man who duped retirees out of life savings in crypto scam jailed\n\nEven Bitcoin - with its infamous volatility - had a rough year in 2022. (bymandesigns - stock.adobe.com)\n\nFrom multiple hacks, to the war in the Ukraine, to investors simply giving up on the extreme level of electricity and computing power to mine new coins, the market plunged.\n\nFor headline currency Bitcoin, the figures were dire. At the start of 2022 one Bitcoin was worth as much as $AUD 75,000.\n\nToday that very same asset is worth just $AUD 25,000 - a value crash of almost 70 per cent. If the property market had the same decline, there would be riots.\n\nBut after a miserable end to 2022, ending in the collapse of exchange FTX and charges brought against its founder, some believe crypto may rise again.\n\nMany in the cryptocurrency sector welcome more regulation as a sign of the technology gaining legitimacy. (Supplied)\n\nSimon Peters, crypto market analyst at social investing network eToro, says some cryptocurrencies may begin to appear to offer good value to long-term investors.\n\n\"This year was a torrid year for the cryptoasset market. Yet, the 'crypto winter' could give way to a 'crypto spring',\" Peters said.\n\nWhen assessing Bitcoin he believes the market may have already bottomed out.\n\n\"A popular 'on-chain metric' to identify top and bottoms in the bitcoin price is the MVRV-Z score,\" Peters explains.\n\n\"At present, the score indicates the current market value of bitcoin is far below its realised or 'fair' value and at the lowest levels since December 2018, the bottom of the last bitcoin bear market.\n\n\"Reaching this point has historically been a good indicator we are near the bottom of a bitcoin price cycle and it suggests we could be closer to a 'crypto spring'.\ufeff\"\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Why customers who trusted crypto giant may be left with nothing\n\nAt the breakout of the war in Ukraine, many thought Bitcoin would be an ideal 'safe haven' asset as it was not connected to geopolitics. (Getty)\n\nRegulation from financial bodies, while typically a brake on hot markets, may actually prove to be beneficial for cryptocurrency given its past links with those operating outside of legitimate financial markets.\n\n\"Regulation is most certainly top of mind for 2023, and this is to be welcomed by investors, platforms and users of crypto alike,\" Peters says.\n\n\"Ensuring best practices are being followed, such as segregation of customer assets, correct collateralisation and reconciliation, plus transparency, will be really important for both regulators and crypto market participants looking for a more sustainable market in the aftermath of events this year.\n\n\"It will also be key to rebuilding trust.\ufeff\"\n\nBitcoin alone shed almost 70 per cent of its value in 2022 - but many believe we are at the bottom of the market. (Getty)\n\nA key barrier in the way of Bitcoin - and consequently cryptocurrency as a whole - is not legitimacy or regulation, but the environment.\n\nMining Bitcoins requires an astonishingly high amount of electricity. It's\ufeff estimated that the energy required to mine a single Bitcoin at current rates would equal that of the traditional Aussie household's electricity consumption for 15 years.\n\nInvestors are shying away from traditional fossil-fuelled assets, particularly during a cost of living crisis.\n\n\"The hashrate and difficulty continues to climb to all-time highs for bitcoin. Whilst this makes the Bitcoin network more secure, greater computational power is needed by mining operations to stay competitive, which could continue to increase the overall energy consumption of the network,\" Peters says.\n\n\"Energy consumption will therefore continue to be a bone of contention in the crypto sector, with bitcoin enthusiasts quick to explain why it's no bad thing, and Ethereum proponents pointing to the big fall in energy intensity.\n\n\"Despite the backdrop of an ongoing energy crisis around the world, the debate will continue to be as intractable as ever.\ufeff\""

        "title": "Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction for 2023 - Nairametrics",
        "content": "Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency space had a bumpy ride throughout 2022. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency began the year exchanging hands around $46,700 and ended the year 2022 trading at $16,547.50, which represents a 64.57% decline. Consequently, the coin\u2019s market capitalization took a tumble from around $900 billion on January 1, 2022, to end the year at around $320 billion.\n\nThe same was the story with the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. The cryptocurrency market capitalization started the year 2022 with a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion and ended the year trading at $795 billion.\n\nThis means the cryptocurrency market lost 63.86% in the year 2020 as contractionary monetary policies made investors weary of risky assets like the cryptocurrency space.\n\nReliving 2022 price predictions: While Bitcoin\u2019s drop-in price could be attributed to the extraordinary circumstances that the entire cryptocurrency market has been through this year, it is important to reevaluate the 2022 price predictions made by various market entities.\n\nS2F Model: One of the most popular predictions was that of analyst PlanB\u2019s Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which predicted that BTC\u2019s price would trade at nearly $110,000 as of December 2022. Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency finished the year trading at almost 85% off target, which raises questions about the validity of the price model.\n\nStock-to-flow models are generally used to price commodities in the traditional markets, as they account for two variables related to an asset: stock and flow. \u201cStock\u201d refers to the total existing supply of the asset, and \u201cflow\u201d refers to the new supply of the asset created each year.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, the Co-founder and Managing Partner of digital asset management platform Nexo, listed some of the factors that could influence Bitcoin to include market demand, regulatory changes and technological developments. He added that though the S2F is an important tool for predicting Bitcoin price, it is based assumptions.\n\nOther models: Besides S2F, other models have been used to attempt to predict the price of Bitcoin in the near and distant future. Two popular ones are Elliott Wave Theory and Hyperwave Theory. While both also find their roots in traditional financial markets, their success in predicting the price of BTC has been relatively limited as well.\n\nWhat you should know: Cryptocurrencies only began their journey as an asset just over a decade ago, and it is safe to say that they are still in the nascent stages of price discovery when compared with commodities like gold or silver and other leading technology stocks like Apple and Microsoft.\n\nThus, while there are various BTC price predictions. It is essential to remember the limited availability of cyclical data to factor into these models. Trenchev added that many different models and approaches can be used to try to predict the price of Bitcoin.\n\nSome people use technical analysis, which involves studying historical price and volume data to identify patterns and trends. Others use fundamental analysis, which involves evaluating the underlying factors that can affect an asset\u2019s demand and supply. No single model or approach is universally considered to be the most reliable for predicting the price of Bitcoin, and it is crucial to consider a range of factors when making any investment decisions.\n\nOne important aspect that could change the trends for the price of Bitcoin is utility. Since Bitcoin is not a smart contract-compatible network, the asset\u2019s utility has been limited to a payment rail. That is slowly beginning to change, with Bitcoin now finding more utility than ever before, supported by the Lightning Network (LN). LN is a layer-2 payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network that enables fast, seamless peer-to-peer transactions. It helps improve the scalability of the network enormously.\n\nMost recently, Michael Saylor\u2019s MicroStrategy announced that it plans to release Lightning Network-powered software and solutions in 2023. Michael Saylor is a strong Bitcoin advocate and his company is one of the largest corporate entities holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Despite the market decline seen in 2022, MicroStrategy continues adding Bitcoin to its treasury.\n\nBetween November 1st and December 21st, 2022, the company acquired 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,181 for a total of $42.8 million. For tax reasons, it sold 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin for a total of $11.8 million on December 22nd. As a repurchase, the company bought 810 BTC on Dec. 24 for $13.6 million in cash. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries, this puts the firm\u2019s holdings at 132,500 BTC, worth around $2.2 billion.\n\nBitcoin price expections for 2023: Here is a look at some price predictions for Bitcoin in 2023.\n\nSimon Schaber, the Chief Business Development Officer of Spool, explained:\n\n\u201cOver the course of 2023, the price of Bitcoin should return to a reasonable 25000-30000 U.S. Dollar range, due to a combination of factors. Firstly, as central banks continue to tighten rates, investors will be looking for alternative investments with higher returns, and Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset of the past decade. Secondly, technology stocks have been underperforming recently, and investors may be looking for other options to diversify their portfolios into risk-on asset classes. These two factors combined will contribute to a reasonable but slow increase in the price of Bitcoin over the next year as we are fighting our way out of this recession.\u201d\n\nJames Wo, the Founder and CEO of Digital Finance Group explained:\n\n\u201cExternal reasons like inflation showing moderation, interest rate slowing, energy crisis getting better, and receding recession fear for the US all leave the door open to BTC price. Moreover, a halving of bitcoin production will occur in 2024. 2023 could see the BTC price rising to $30,000.\u201d\n\nImportant Note: Investors should not view this article as investment advice and should do their research and consult the services of a professional financial advisor."

        "title": "BREAKING: Blackrock adds Bitcoin to their $15TR Global Allocation Fund, trillions of $ to flow the market - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "The American investment firm, BlackRock has added Bitcoin to its $15 trillion Global Allocation Fund.\n\nWith this move, BlackRock can scoop up all BTC on exchanges with just 0.32% of the assets it has under management.\n\nAmerican multinational investment management company, BlackRock has allegedly added Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest digital currency by market capitalization to its Global Allocation Fund. As the world\u2019s biggest investment firm with over $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as of January 2022, the Bitcoin addition to the firm\u2019s primary fund is considered a very bullish move for the crypto industry.\n\nBlackRock starts to add $BTC to their own Global Allocation Fund for passive investors \ud83d\udc40 Its estimated that only 0.32% of their investment fund is enough to buy all #Bitcoin kept on exchanges Still want to short? \ud83d\udc47 1/5 \u2014 The Wolf of Alt Street (@altc01n) January 5, 2023\n\nBitcoin has thrived over the years as the pioneering cryptocurrency and since its inception about 14 years ago, it has notably gained the interest of institutional investors today. While the charge by Wall Street into Bitcoin can be attributed to MicroStrategy Incorporated, a business intelligence and software firm with over 132,500 Bitcoin units, BlackRock has also made some significant moves to solidify its growing interests in the nascent asset class and sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs reported by CNF, the New York-based firm partnered with publicly traded exchange Coinbase Global Inc back in August last year to offer institutional investors a direct avenue to invest in Bitcoin. The company has made some follow-up moves and launched a spot Bitcoin private trust for its high-profile clients shortly after the Coinbase deal.\n\nThe addition of Bitcoin to its Global Allocation Fund is considered a bigger game changer as it implies the firm could invest directly into the premier cryptocurrency. Considering its last reported asset base, BlackRock will need just about 0.32 percent of the funds in its custody to scoop up all the Bitcoin available on exchanges.\n\nAccording to speculations by the crypto analyst, the Wolf of Alts $treet, the total Bitcoin on all centralized exchanges (CEXs) is currently pegged at about 1,856,625.8. This figure is valued at around $31.1 billion when computed with the current price of BTC around $16,000. In his analysis, $32 billion is just around 0.32 percent of the $10 trillion in custody by BlackRock.\n\nA Bullish Reality\n\nFor the past year, Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem have been waiting for a significant fundamental push that may signal an end to the current crypto winter. The push made by BlackRock to add Bitcoin to its Global Allocation Fund is perhaps one of the most prominent bullish realities the industry is starting the year out with.\n\nWhile BlackRock is definitely going to be conservative with its allocations to Bitcoin, its investments in the coin are largely going to be very significant, and thus, likely impact the coin\u2019s price growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next few months, we are likely to see trillions of dollars flow into the market as other big investment management companies may also choose to follow in the footsteps of BlackRock to go more bullish on Bitcoin. These events can fuel a run in the price of BTC and a visible rub-off may be seen for altcoins as well.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "Number Of Bitcoin Addresses Holding Over 10+ BTC Reaches Two-Year High | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Bitcoin addresses over the last couple of months have been fluctuating between accumulation and dumping. But one important fact is that there has been consistent growth in 2023 despite the market being less than a week into the new year. The important cohort here is bitcoin addresses that are holding more than 10 BTC on their balances.\n\nSmall Bitcoin Investors Want A Bigger Slice\n\nAccording to a chart posted by Glassnode Alerts on Twitter, the number of bitcoin addresses holding more than 10 BTC on their balances has touched a new two-year high. This investor cohort had previously declined especially as the price of the digital asset had suffered multiple dips and crashes.\n\nNevertheless, this cohort regained their optimism toward bitcoin at the end of 2022. Back on December 30, just one day left for the year, the number of addresses with 10+ BTC had reached a new two-year high of 155,283 addresses after a significant jump, but only a week later, it would climb to a new two-year high of 155,286.\n\nAddresses holding 10+ BTC reaches two-year high | Source: Glassnode\n\nLooking at the chart above, it illustrates just how much it has risen in the last month. It works out to about a 4% increase in the number of investors that match this criterion, and it is not the only one seeing such growth.\n\nAnother cohort, addresses holding more than 1 BTC on their balances also saw tremendous growth in the new year. This time around, it reached a new all-time high of 979,707 addresses after trending around 800,000 close to the end of 2022.\n\nWhat The Accumulation Could Mean For BTC\n\nDespite the size of bitcoin making it harder to move with such accumulation trends alone, the fact that addresses holding 1+ and 10+ BTC were recording such growth has no doubt had a positive impact on the digital asset. If not moving the digital asset\u2019s price itself, lifting investor spirits during such dreary times positively impacted the price.\n\nBTC price at $16,727 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the last 7 days, the price of bitcoin is back in the green and had seen 1.39% gains, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Losses in the digital asset in the last day have also slowed down to just 0.56%. This means BTC is still able to hold support above $16,600 while keeping the bears at bay.\n\nBTC is currently changing hands at a price of $16,730 at the time of this writing. Trading volume is down 6.83% in the last day to be sitting at $14.4 billion."

        "content": "After ending 2022 in a sideways trading pattern, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has kicked off the new year with short-term gains, although the value still languishes below key support levels. Bitcoin is also attempting to build momentum towards new levels while seeking inspiration from elements such as macroeconomic news.\n\nIndeed, by press time on January 6, Bitcoin was valued at $16,758, with gains of about 6.6% over the last week. The weekly chart shows that Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 peak stood at $16,721 on January 4.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nDespite the gains, Bitcoin investors are looking for a possible bottom to usher in a new rally for the maiden cryptocurrency. Currently, the $17,000 level remains a key resistance position for BTC.\n\nImpact of macroeconomic news on BTC\u2019s price\n\nBased on the recent price movement, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe in a tweet on January 6, stated that Bitcoin is at support while identifying key long positions to look out for, especially with key macroeconomic data coming out.\n\n\u201cIt [Bitcoin] needs to hold above $16.6K to avoid a puke to low $16K and to sustain upward momentum. In that regard, with the data today, I\u2019d be looking at bit lower for longs towards $17K,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin\u2019s possible rally toward $17,000 can partly find a boost after the United States recorded an unemployment rate of 3.5% in December from the 3.7% witnessed in November 2022. Furthermore, the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December, higher than the estimated 200,000.\n\nWith Bitcoin being impacted by the Federal Reserve monetary policies, the jobs data will be crucial since it forms part of the institution\u2019s interest rate hike decision.\n\nFurthermore, crypto investors will be looking at the release of ISM. Notably, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) is responsible for measuring the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index or PMI for both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors across the U.S.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin\u2019s one-day technical analysis retrieved from TradingView is dominated by bearishness. A summary of the daily gauges recommends the \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 11 while oscillators are \u2018neutral\u2019 at 8. The moving averages gauge is for \u2018sell\u2019 at 10.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite Bitcoin showing signs of recovery, the machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions indicates that the asset might be in line for a bearish outlook in the first month of 2023. In this line, the forecast suggests that Bitcoin will trade at $15,532 on January 31.\n\nIn the meantime, investors will be hoping the asset builds on 2022 milestones. For instance, despite the market downturn, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain witnessed a transaction of over $8 trillion in 2022.\n\nAt the same time, crypto sector players anticipate a mixed 2023 for Bitcoin, with a section expecting further effects from incidents such as FTX collapse, while others project the 2024 halving event as a significant catalyst for the flagship crypto.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
