        "title": "What\u2019s behind the Bitcoin price surge? Has surpassed $41,000 - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bitcoin is once again having a moment. On Monday, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency soared past $41,000 for the first time in over a year and a half \u2014 and marking a 150% rise so far this year.\n\nVolatile bitcoin rocketed from just over $5,000 at the start of the pandemic to nearly $68,000 in November 2021, according to FactSet, a period marked by a surge in demand for technology products. Prices fell back to earth during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at taming inflation and then the collapse of FTX, one of the biggest companies in crypto.\n\nWhen 2023 began, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000 after losing more than 75% of its value. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool. And the collapse of prominent tech-focused banks actually led more investors to turn to crypto as they bailed out of positions in Silicon Valley start-ups and other risky bets.\n\nBut fueling this latest rally are prospects for the possible approval of spot bitcoin exchange traded funds \u2014 a pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like stocks.\n\nIndustry advocates say this new way of investing in bitcoin at spot prices, instead of futures, could make it easier for anyone to enter the cryptoverse while lowering some of the well-documented risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. Regulators have previously rejected bitcoin spot ETF applications, but recent wins for some crypto fund managers have improved odds for a first approval, perhaps as soon as next month.\n\n\u201cThe longer-term catalyst (for bitcoin) is a lot of optimism related to the potential approval of a spot ETF,\u201d Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey said Monday. He noted, however, that a regulatory green light doesn\u2019t promise continued gains.\n\nWhile analysts expect the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs to create a much larger pool of crypto investors, future volumes could go either way, Carey added. That could either boost or undermine bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current rally also arrives during an incredibly disruptive period for cryptocurrencies. Just last month, the U.S. government slapped Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, with a $4 billion fine as its founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to a felony charge.\n\nBut Binance continues to operate and maintain its market share, Carey noted. In some ways, the company\u2019s settlement \u201cpropelled the market forward more by removing one of the ... more ominous overhangs that was a sort of a big question mark,\u201d he said, noting bitcoin\u2019s gains in the two weeks since the settlement was announced.\n\nDespite the recent excitement around bitcoin, experts still maintain that crypto is a risky bet with wildly unpredictable fluctuations in value. In short, investors can lose money as quickly as they make it.\n\nLast year\u2019s collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX also \u201cleft a big scar\u201d on the public\u2019s confidence in the crypto industry and crushed retail investors, Edward Moya, a former senior market analyst at Oanda, previously told The Associated Press \u2014 noting that institutional money, like hedge funds, are behind the bulk of current crypto investing.\n\nCarey added that liquidity in cryptocurrency markets has yet to return to where it was before FTX collapsed, and lower liquidity can exacerbate price fluctuations.\n\n\u201cIn the past few months, that has normally been the price moving up \u2014 but people should always be aware it can go in the reverse and quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of around 1:30 p.m. Eastern time Monday, the price of bitcoin stood at $41,709.\n\nThe stocks of some other crypto players have also seen rises over recent months, but not with the same speed or heights as bitcoin. Ethereum, for example, stood at $2,223 Monday afternoon, up 85% since the start of 2023. Meanwhile, Binance Coin and Dash are down about 5.25% and 24.37% for the year, respectively, with Monday afternoon prices of roughly $231 and $32."

        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe price of bitcoin soared above $40,000 on Monday, hitting its highest level in 18 months as investors look ahead to a lower interest rate environment and key regulatory approvals that could make the crypto asset more mainstream.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, was up more than 5% over the past 24 hours, trading at $41,600, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nOn Friday, Investors began piling on after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank\u2019s policy was \u201cwell into restrictive territory,\u201d words that some interpreted to mean that interest rate hikes were over, even though Powell underscored the Fed was prepared to raise rates again if needed.\n\n\u201cBitcoin breaking $40,000 isn\u2019t as juicy as the first time it happened in January 2021,\u201d said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of the crypto lender Nexo. \u201cYet consider where we were a year ago, at $15,500, and this is a significant upturn in fortunes for an asset that looked dead and buried.\u201d\n\nThe rally also reflects investors\u2019 eagerness to move on from crypto\u2019s most recent scandals. Last month, Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, pleaded guilty to federal money-laundering charges and resigned from his role as CEO. That came just weeks after a jury convicted FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried of orchestrating a multibillion-dollar fraud.\n\nBitcoin is now up 150% for the year, though it remains far from its historical high of $69,000 in November of 2021.\n\nPart of the enthusiasm hinges on expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund, or spot ETF. The SEC faces a January 10 deadline to approve applications for such funds.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF would allow traditional investors to have exposure to the digital asset without actually owning it. The market has long desired a way to ride the digital asset\u2019s wild rallies, but its volatility has also made owning bitcoin unappealing outside of the digital asset community."

        "title": "What To Expect From Bitcoin and Crypto Markets In 2024 - Investopedia",
        "content": "KEY TAKEAWAYS The approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has been the key area of focus for crypto investors, as it could broaden access to Bitcoin.\n\nOptimism surrounding the possible approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF helped contribute to a rally in the price of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n2023 was a pivotal year in terms of crypto enforcement actions, with further regulatory clarity expected to arrive in 2024.\n\nAn end of policies focused on monetary tightening from central banks around the world could also lead to a positive outcomes for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin's recent rally may have taken it past the $42,000 market and helped put the crypto winter of 2022 far in the distance. However, it was also a year the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization started on shaky grounds at a mere $16,500 level.\n\nHere's what you need to know with the crypto markets looking ahead to the next year, standing at the cusp of important events such as the fate of the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Bitcoin halving, and developments in crypto regulation.\n\n\n\nThe Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Be a Game Changer\n\nEver since Blackrock (BLK) originally filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June, the impending approval of such a financial product has been the key area of focus for the crypto market.\n\nSo far, retail investors can only gain cryptocurrency exposure through ETFs that trade in cryptocurrency futures. A spot Bitcoin ETF would allow investors, especially retail investors, to gain access to Bitcoin without needing to hold their investment in a Bitcoin wallet.\n\n\n\nAnalysts expect big money to flow into Bitcoin spot ETFs if the SEC gives its approval, and that optimism has helped boost the price of Bitcoin, with the spot Bitcoin ETF market anticipated to grow to $100 billion over time, according to a report by Bloomberg. A report from Galaxy estimates inflows in spot Bitcoin ETF products could rise from $14 billion in the first year to $39 billion within three years.\n\nThat said, there remains uncertainty around the SEC's decision. The SEC has reportedly held multiple rounds of talks with prospective ETF issuers, with issuers amending applications to meet regulators' expectations.\n\n\"I'm optimistic, but I think it's quite likely we have another round of rejections before we get the positive news,\" BitGo CEO Mike Belshe recently told Bloomberg.\n\nBlackrock and others have also filed for spot ether ETFs. However, the likelihood of approval for those products based around the alternative crypto asset is similarly unclear.\n\n\n\nWhy The Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Will Be Crucial\n\nBitcoin halving\u2014or an event that roughly cuts in half rewards to Bitcoin miners for successfully mining the cryptocurrency\u2014is expected to take place in 2024.\n\nWhy is it important? At 21 million, the supply of Bitcoin is finite making it harder to mine as more Bitcoins come into circulation. Bitcoin miners are rewarded for successfully mining a block. And the reward gets diminished with a halving, indirectly also impacting the number of Bitcoins in circulation. And price is inversely proportionate to supply.\n\nThe crypto market's boom and bust cycles have generally revolved around the Bitcoin halving event, which happens roughly every four years and involves a halving of the amount of new Bitcoin that is issued to miners on the network around every ten minutes.\n\nAccording to a report from crypto asset manager Grayscale, there is reason to believe this halving event (and any positive tailwinds from a spot Bitcoin ETF approval) could be more impactful than it was in the past. This is due to the current distribution of the Bitcoin supply, which is largely held by entities that tend to hold for long periods of time.\n\n\"If these trends continue, the Grayscale Research team anticipates that the dynamics of Bitcoin\u2019s ownership could increasingly amplify the impact of macro events, like evolving global policies and regulation (e.g., approval of US spot Bitcoin ETF), as well as crypto market developments, like the 2024 Bitcoin halving,\" said Grayscale Analyst Will Ogden Moore in the report.\n\nDespite the Bitcoin-denominated cut for miners related to the halving event, Sabre56 CEO Phil Harvey says the mining industry will be fine, even in a scenario where a spot Bitcoin ETF is not approved. \"In the absence of an ETF launch, the mining sector is likely to maintain its current state of health,\" Harvey told Investopedia. \"Present revenue metrics for miners with direct access to power and equipped with state-of-the-art power generation reveal a robust economic landscape. The current economics are expected to endure, ensuring sustained and healthy profit margins post-halving.\"\n\nClarity On Crypto Regulation In The Cards?\n\n2023 has been a massive year for crypto enforcement actions, with many of the biggest names in the industry, from Binance to Coinbase, facing lawsuits from the SEC or even the Department of Justice. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of fraud and former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao is facing charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nAfter these recent events, it's becoming clear that the Wild West years of the crypto industry may be coming to an end. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) recently shared her optimism that regulatory clarity may finally arrive in early 2024 due to the move of traditional financial titans into the crypto market.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Rostin Behnam has pointed to Congress's increased concerns regarding crypto's potential use in illicit finance as a reason behind the legislative body's renewed interest in the subject.\n\nIn terms of other areas of regulation and policy that could affect the crypto market in 2024, TradeStation Head of Brokerage Solutions Anthony Rousseau pointed to the Financial Account Standards Board's (FASB) rule change for valuing crypto assets and a potential end to the Federal Reserve and other central banks' policies of monetary tightening.\n\nThe FASB rule change \"opens the door for corporates now to have a path to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet as a reserve asset, as MicroStrategy has adopted,\" Rousseau told Investopedia. \"It\u2019s plausible to believe we have reached the heights of this [central bank] tightening cycle. For risk assets to get a sustained bid we will need to see a path forward with lower rates and an end to Quantitative Tightening.\"\n\n"

At one point, the coin traded as high as $44,903.45, its highest level since Apr. 7, 2022.\n\nTuesday's gains bring bitcoin up more than 160% for the year. Ether was higher by 1.6% on the day at $2,263.76. It's up 88% for 2023.\n\nBitcoin has been reaching new highs more frequently over the past several weeks. It broke through $40,000 over the weekend for the first time since April 2022, after beginning November around the $34,000 level and climbing incrementally to new year-to-date highs in between."

        "content": "Although the cryptocurrency industry remains shadowed by recent blowups and controversy, the world's most important token \u2014 bitcoin \u2014 is making a comeback.\n\nThe value of bitcoin soared to nearly $42,000 on Monday, marking the first time the digital currency cracked $40,000 in 18 months, price tracker CoinDesk Indices shows.\n\nThe resurgence stands in contrast to the questions that have dogged the sector since last year's spectacular flameout of crypto exchange FTX, leading to the November conviction of founder Sam Bankman-Fried on seven counts of fraud. Also last month, Binance \u2014 the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange platform \u2014 agreed to pay $4.3 billion after admitting that it violated U.S. laws to prevent money laundering and sanctions violations, with CEO Changpeng Zhao pleading guilty to one federal charge.\n\nDespite such scandals, bitcoin's priced has soared 150% this year, although it remains down from a high of roughly $69,000 in late 2021.\n\nWhat is bitcoin again?\n\nBitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and was created in 2009. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use peer-to-peer technology to facilitate instant payments without the need of a third party such as a bank or payment processor, according to bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nUnlike traditional money, cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase goods and services on the internet, in addition to being held as investments (like stocks). However, crypto prices are notoriously volatile, and investing in any kind of crypto can be risky, according to investment firm Charles Schwab.\n\nThere are more than 11,000 cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin is the most valuable (in dollar terms), in addition to having the largest market capitalization of any digital asset, data from crypto price tracker CoinGecko shows.\n\nWhy is bitcoin surging now?\n\nSeveral factors are fueling bitcoin's latest rally. Perhaps the most important are signs that major investment firms are set to get regulatory approval to offer spot bitcoin exchange traded funds \u2014 a pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like stocks. Federal regulators are expected to give the green light for several bitcoin ETFs as early as January, which could make investing in crypto more accessible to investors, Yiannis Giokas, a senior product director at Moody's, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"As more and more managers venture into the bitcoin spot ETF space, more retail and institutional investors, even the more conservative ones, will feel a higher degree of comfort investing in this space,\" he said.\n\nBitcoin prices are also benefiting from a growing conviction on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve is done hiking its benchmark interest rate now that inflation is receding and that the central bank could even start loosening monetary policy by mid-2024 to keep the economy on track.\n\nWhen interest rates fall, investors are more likely to pour money into riskier assets such as crypto.\n\n\"Lower rates are bullish for bitcoin,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data firm Amberdata, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nGiokas thinks 2024 could be a banner year for bitcoin, a proxy for how well the crypto market as a whole is doing.\n\nBitcoin \"hit $40,000 for the first time in 2021, and every time it was followed by a bull run, so it's a logical expectation from the markets that another run is on its way,\" he said.\n\n\u2014 The Associated Press contributed reporting."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Prices Are Rising at the End of 2023 - Money",
        "content": "Bitcoin is back. The crypto industry\u2019s biggest asset responded to a dismal 2022 with a sustained climb upward this year. In the last few months of 2023, that slow crawl has turned into a cannon shot.\n\nBitcoin prices rose from $16,625 in January up to around $30,000 at the end of October \u2014 onward all the way to over $42,000 in early December. That\u2019s a year-to-date increase of over 150%, including an increase of around 21% over the past month. Perhaps no one should be surprised by the surge: After all, we\u2019re in the middle of a time when the most famous cryptocurrency historically performs the strongest.\n\nBitcoin's price has often seen significant spikes in the fourth quarter of the year, suggesting a seasonal trend. In 2016, for example, bitcoin gained 63% from the beginning of October to the end of December. In 2017, it gained 267% in that same time frame. In fact, between 2016 and 2021, the crypto has gained an average of 25% in October, 8% in November and 11% in December, according to data by investing research company Bespoke Investing Group.\n\nThis gives a lot of hope for investors that bitcoin can add onto its recent surge. But no one can accurately predict where volatile investments like crypto are headed at any given time, and some experts question whether there's any truth to the theory that bitcoin prices often get a bump toward the end of the year.\n\nDo bitcoin prices rise at the end of the year?\n\nThe numbers indicate that the fourth quarter has been historically favorable for bitcoin prices. But experts have not come to a consensus on why or even if bitcoin prices often surge in the fall.\n\nA popular theory is that crypto buyers, just like stock investors, are apt to trade heavily toward the end of the calendar year. Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s chief investment officer, Matthew Hougan, previously told Money that while investors are looking to strategize their portfolios for the year\u2019s end, lots of money has tended to end up in crypto allocations.\n\nOthers say it\u2019s just too early to draw any conclusions about bitcoin pricing trends. Omid Malekan, crypto expert and adjunct professor at Columbia University's Business School, tells Money that he\u2019s \u201cnot certain if bitcoin has a strong seasonal trend or if it's coincidental.\u201d\n\nCrypto may be over a decade old, but it\u2019s still infantile compared to other assets like stocks or bonds. This lack of sufficient data, Malekan says, makes it difficult to assess the validity of any crypto trends.\n\nMalekan says bitcoin is defined by \u201ceras\u201d perhaps more so than seasonal trends. \u201cThe last bull market and crash were driven by central bank liquidity and fears about inflation and the resulting monetary tightening,\u201d he says. These eras are not seasonal trends that hold up over time, but rather shorter-lived events driven by investor behavior.\n\nDo bitcoin prices and stocks rise and fall together?\n\nBut wait, don\u2019t stocks often rise in the fourth quarter as well? That\u2019s true. As it turns out, bitcoin prices and stocks seem to be more linked than you might expect. And this relationship could be what gives some credence to the idea of bitcoin price seasonality.\n\nIn February, researchers at Georgetown University discovered that a correlation between cryptocurrency prices and the stock market continues to grow stronger. Specifically, they find that price movements of bitcoin and the S&P 500 Index are correlated, and continue to become more so. They said that the linkage \u201cmay reflect the fact that the two markets are becoming more connected, as institutional investors increasingly enter the crypto world.\u201d\n\nWhile the reasons why the two investments follow the same price patterns aren't totally understood yet, it would make sense that crypto is prone to the same kind of selloffs that happen in the stock market.\n\nIf this is true, then there is reason to believe that bitcoin prices tend to rise at the end of the year at least partly because stocks also frequently rise at the end of the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has posted an average gain of 4.2% in the last quarter of the year. That's twice as good as the next best-performing first quarter, which averages a return of 2.1%. And just like how September is typically a bad month for bitcoin prices, it is also historically one of the worst months for stock performance.\n\nWhere are bitcoin prices heading now?\n\nIf the theory that bitcoin prices rise at the end of the year holds true, the crypto could continue its recent hot run. However, as the saying goes: Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\nLast year, the coin dropped by 12.3% over the course of the fourth quarter. Of course, bitcoin\u2019s 2022 was marked by losses throughout the entirety of the year, with the crypto losing 66% over 12 months. In retrospect, banking on a strong end of the year in 2022 would have proved foolish. Ultimately, for what it's worth the October-December period in 2022 was bitcoin's second-worst quarter in the year.\n\nWith wind behind bitcoin's sails this year, though, as well as building excitement over likely upcoming changes in crypto investing options, many experts have voiced bullish predictions for the near term.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one step closer to a spot bitcoin ETF, and investors are optimistic that an approval could happen fairly soon,\u201d says Anthony Georgiades, general partner at investing fund Innovation Capital. \u201cThere\u2019s also much anticipation about the next bitcoin halving, which typically serves as a catalyst for bull markets.\u201d\n\nA bitcoin ETF is an investment fund made up of bitcoin or bitcoin-related companies. Right now, bitcoin ETFs only consist of futures contracts, instead of the cryptocurrency itself. Investing companies Fidelity and BlackRock are both waiting for approval for their spot bitcoin ETFs, which would be the first ETFs to contain bitcoin itself. Bitcoin halving, meanwhile, is a process in which the rate at which coins are released is cut in half; it happens every four years, and the next halving is expected in spring of 2024.\n\nOthers say that the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in 2024 is also driving optimism. Zachary Townsend, CEO of crypto company Meanwhile, says \u201cthe cost of servicing the existing and new debt will simply be too high\" for the Fed to avoid cutting its rates.\n\nOne consequence of this, Townsend says, is \"debasement of the currency,\" or a drop in value of the U.S. dollar. \"It\u2019s in these kinds of environments in particular, when fiat currency is getting debased, that bitcoin performs best.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, though, that these cuts might be further off than previously anticipated. The Fed is unlikely to follow through with the December rate hike it threatened previously; but even without one final hike, experts still largely foresee a long pause. A majority of opinions seem to be that the first rate cut will not come until the second half of next year. So, this bullish catalyst might be a ways off.\n\nNewsletter Make smarter money decisions in just a few minutes every day Subscribe to Daily Money to get more of the latest personal finance news, stories, and analysis delivered everyday to your inbox.

        "content": "Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rose to over $40,000 on Sunday, reaching a price not seen since April 2022.\n\nThe popular cryptocurrency, which was trading above $41,500 at time of publication, is often seen as an indicator of broader market sentiment in the digital asset space, with other tokens also rising in value, including Ether, which broke $2,200.\n\nAnalysts point to several factors behind the rally, including signs that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, including for the leading crypto asset manager Grayscale, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.\n\nGrayscale won a landmark case against the SEC in August over its application to issue a spot Bitcoin ETF, which allows investors access to a fund that provides them with direct exposure to the current price of Bitcoin. Since the decision, which the SEC declined to appeal, Grayscale has met with representatives from the agency, including last week.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s next approval window is in early January. Other ETF applicants include TradFi giants such as Blackrock and Fidelity.\n\nAfter reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin plummeted in 2022 after the collapse of several well-known crypto projects, including the Do Kwon\u2013led Terra and the Sam Bankman-Fried\u2013led FTX. Bitcoin started 2023 under $17,000, with fears that more prominent crypto companies could fail, including the world's leading exchange, Binance.\n\nAfter a long-anticipated case by the Department of Justice, prosecutors finally reached a settlement with Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao in November, with Zhao agreeing to step down and the company paying $4.3 billion in fines. Still, the firm will be allowed to keep operating, albeit with a U.S.-government-led monitorship, which is a better-than-expected outcome for many traders.\n\nA rising tide\n\nWhile crypto acolytes often portray Bitcoin as an alternative to the traditional financial system, its price still tracks the performance of overall markets. Analysts point to expectations that the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates in 2024, leading to investors making riskier bets, as another factor driving Bitcoin's rally.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies are not the only assets buoyed by Bitcoin's rise. Coinbase, the leading U.S. crypto exchange, has seen its stock price rise by over 50% in the last month. MicroStrategy, a publicly traded software company led by Michael Saylor that owns over $5 billion in Bitcoin, announced on Thursday that it had acquired an additional $593.3 million in Bitcoin at an average price of nearly $37,000.\n\nLeading crypto industry figures are predicting the rally will continue, with Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz telling Bloomberg TV last week that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. could drive billions of dollars into the sector."

        "content": "Bitcoin built on its recent rally and hit its highest level in more than a year on Monday, bolstered by anticipation of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund approval and bets on U.S. interest rate cuts.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency surged more than 5% on Monday to a 19-month high, and was trading at $41,809 as of 4:00 pm ET after briefly topping $42,000 earlier in the day, based on Coin Metrics data. This is the first time since April 2022 that bitcoin has breached the $40,000 level, according to LSEG. Bitcoin is now up more than 150% from the start of the year.\n\nThis comes after scandals rocked the market including the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November last year. Last month, FTX founder Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all seven criminal charges brought against him related to the collapse of his crypto empire.\n\n\"Now that $40,000 has been revisited for the first time in almost 19 months, $48,000 and $52,000 look to be the next significant lines in the sand,\" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of digital asset company Nexo.\n\nCNBC reported last week that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission officials met with representatives from Grayscale, BlackRock and the Nasdaq. In a memo, the SEC said it met with Grayscale on Thursday about the potential conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The SEC had previously blocked this move, but Grayscale challenged that decision in court and won."

        "content": "Many financial advisors remain wary of advising on crypto, but that might have to end.\n\nThe majority of American investors now own Bitcoin, more than a decade after the cryptocurrency first hit the market, according to a new report \u2014 albeit based on a small survey \u2014 by Unchained. Unchained is a financial services provider for Bitcoin.\n\nDue to bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, owners of cryptocurrency are hard to track. However, according to Grayscale, a digital asset manager and one of the world\u2019s largest holders of Bitcoin, a significant majority of holders are small investors. According to the company, 74 percent of Bitcoin owners hold less than 0.01 worth of the currency. Additionally, the largest holders of Bitcoin are exchanges \u2014 like Binance and Robinhood \u2014 which represent millions of individual investors. According to 21Shares, one of the world\u2019s largest issuers of crypto ETPs, the number of retail investors holding bitcoin has increased 11 percent from one year ago and about 34 percent compared to two years ago.\n\nUnchained surveyed 402 U.S. residents between the ages of 18 and 78 who had a least one investment account. Thirty-nine percent of respondents were Millennials, 32 percent were Gen X, and 21 percent were Boomers. Seventy-one percent of respondents had at least $100,000 in investable assets.\n\nAccording to the survey, 95 percent of investors who owned Bitcoin said they would buy or strongly consider buying more of the cryptocurrency in 2024. Additionally, nearly half of those who did not currently own Bitcoin at the time of the survey in October said that they would strongly consider buying it next year.\n\nThe majority of investors (79 percent) believe that Bitcoin will eventually reach a new all-time high above $69,000 (it\u2019s now about $37,000), with about 55 percent of investors believing that will happen next year.\n\nAmong survey respondents, Bitcoin was selected by 34 percent of investors as the asset they believed would perform the best in 2024. This was followed by gold with 27 percent, the S&P 500 with 21 percent, and cash with 18 percent.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s growing prominence, an advising gap exists.\n\nAccording to Cerulli Associates, a wealth management research and consulting firm, just 1 percent of advisors report that they use cryptocurrency for some of their clients based on their own recommendations. An additional 26 percent of advisors do not currently use or discuss cryptocurrencies with their clients but expect to do so in the future.\n\nThat means the majority of advisors do not use or discuss crypto with their clients and do not plan to do so in the future.\n\nPart of the issue is the regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto.\n\nOver the last year, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry in a bid to tighten regulation and safeguard investors, in part due to the increase in crypto-related fraud and the collapse of prominent crypto exchanges. However, many in the industry believe that a bitcoin spot ETF is inevitable.\n\nThis month, Anchorage Digital, the first and only federally chartered crypto bank, launched its first custody and separately managed account offerings specifically for RIAs, helping provide another compliant way to custody digital assets.\n\nIncreased regulatory clarity, SEC approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, and a potential U.S. recession were the top reasons that were most likely to affect an investor\u2019s decision to buy Bitcoin. Forty-two percent of owners and 35 percent of non-owners said increased U.S. regulatory clarity would make them consider buying Bitcoin.\n\nAdditional rejections by the SEC of a Bitcoin spot ETF was the number one factor that would prompt an investor to decrease their Bitcoin holdings. In comparison, only 12 percent of all investors said they would decrease their position if their financial advisor or another trusted source told them to do so.\n\nTwenty-six percent of people that don\u2019t own Bitcoin said they would likely buy Bitcoin if their financial advisor or another trusted source recommended it."

For all the angst in the run-up to this, though, the industry has taken it in stride. Anyway, CZ's replacement , Richard Teng, just had his first big public interview, and it was not a smooth debut , according to CoinDesk's Helene Braun. He came across as evasive. The company never says where it's based, and Teng was opaque about that and other issues. The question is whether this matters.

        "content": "Let the good times roll. After being stuck near the $38,000 mark for weeks, Bitcoin soared more than 5% on Sunday as it crossed $40,000 for the first time since April 2022. While this is still a ways from the currency\u2019s all-time high, the return of $40,000 Bitcoin is a significant psychological milestone and has triggered a wave of digital backslapping on the echo chamber known as Crypto Twitter, where too many of us spend far too much time.\n\nThe glee over $40,000 was tempered by warnings, however. Some longtime crypto watchers warned the recent price action will bring about the full-blown return of the hucksters and scammers who made the industry so notorious in the past. Crypto journalist and Fortune alum David Z. Morris put it this way: \u201cHope you guys enjoyed chilling, once we cross $40k the normies will be back and things will get stupid and mostly bad again. If history teaches us anything, the enforcement actions of the past two years will mean exactly nothing because a whole new crop of morons will arrive.\u201d\n\nMorris wasn\u2019t the only one making this observation. And it\u2019s a fair concern since previous booms have gone like this: Bitcoin goes on a run, leading to buzz on social media, which pulls in a new crop of green investors, 95% of whom eschew any basic research as they try to get a piece of the new thing. It\u2019s not long before a good number of them stray beyond the confines of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the handful of other reputable cryptocurrencies and\u2014egged on by financial predators\u2014purchase an \u201cup-and-coming\u201d token instead. Months later they find themselves holding a near worthless pool of BARF tokens and cursing the gym trainer or YouTube guy (hey there, Lark!) who persuaded them to set their modest savings on fire in the first place.\n\nI have no doubt these forces are already revving up and, if Bitcoin approaches its all-time high of nearly $69,000, the con artists will return en masse. But I\u2019m not quite as cynical as Morris. Despite the here-we-go-again sensation, there are three reasons to think this latest crypto bull market will be less driven by scams than the previous ones.\n\nThe first is regulators. Unlike the booms of 2017 and 2021, when the SEC and others sleepwalked through mind-boggling frauds, the agencies are hovering like a bad-tempered hawk looking to shred anything that even smells like crypto. Second is the industry itself. Those left standing, including Coinbase and some of the better venture capitalists, are sick of being pilloried for the sins of the crooks in their midst\u2014and just might be more forceful in denouncing the bad actors. Finally, after the myriad scams of the last go-round, many investors will have learned their lesson and only come back to crypto cautiously\u2014if they come back at all.\n\n\u201cThis time it\u2019s different\u201d is usually terrible investment advice (which this is not!), but there\u2019s no denying the crypto industry is older and wiser, which has to count for something. Time will tell if crypto\u2019s worst moments are in the past\u2014or if a new crop of Sam Bankman-Frieds and Do Kwons wait in the wings.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nA federal judge rebuked the SEC in regard to a crypto investigation, asking the agency to explain why it shouldn't be sanctioned for apparently lying in a recent application for a temporary restraining order.

The cryptocurrency has attracted good and bad headlines as it's worked its way through multiple peaks over the years, and despite a reputation for volatility, it continues to attract new investors with its promise of market-beating returns.\n\nHere's what to know about investing in Bitcoin.\n\nHow to buy bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency. This means it's a form of electronic money that secures and validates transactions via the use of cryptography. In Bitcoin's case, people and organizations known as \"miners\" use computing hardware to calculate a code \u2014 known as a \"hash\" \u2014 that encrypts the data contained in transactions. This data is collected into \"blocks,\" which are linked together in a blockchain that cannot, in theory, be changed once written.\n\nOn an economic level, Bitcoin's creator \u2014 the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 created it in 2008 as a form of \"sound money,\" akin to digital gold.\n\n\"What makes Bitcoin so special is that it has a finite supply of 21 million coins, with only a couple million left to be mined,\" explains Edward Moya, chief market strategist at OANDA's MarketPulse. \"Simple supply and demand for Bitcoin is the main reason why prices have skyrocketed over the past year.\"\n\nDespite having a fixed maximum supply, Bitcoin has shown remarkable volatility throughout most of its life with major fluctuations in its price.\n\nSuch swings make Bitcoin a highly speculative asset, one that should be considered only by traders willing to stomach a fair amount of risk. That said, at least some analysts suspect that its volatility will gradually decline over time, as its market grows and reduces its destabilizing reliance on leverage.\n\n1. Choose a crypto exchange\n\nFor most people, the best place to buy Bitcoin is on a crypto exchange. These are online platforms dedicated to facilitating trades in cryptocurrency, usually by offering trading pairs (e.g., USD to Bitcoin) and usually by matching buyers with sellers.\n\nMore inexperienced traders may wish to try a more general trading platform such as Robinhood. These have the benefit of being more user-friendly than the average crypto exchange, although their major downside is that many don't let users withdraw their bitcoin.\n\nQuick tip: New investors should check the fees charged by exchanges, since these can vary quite widely. They should also check for the minimum account balance required by their chosen platform, since certain exchanges impose a minimum. Others also set minimums for account deposits via bank transfer.\n\n2. Choose a payment method\n\nExchanges also vary in terms of the payment methods they support. Most major platforms do offer the option of linking your bank account for wire and ACH transfers, as well as the option of linking a debit card. Some also let you pay via PayPal.\n\nRegardless of the option you choose, you will have to verify your identity when first signing up for an account and registering a payment method. In the US, you're usually required to submit a scan of a state-issued ID, such as a driver's license or identification card.\n\nDepending on where you are and on your chosen platform, you may also be required to provide scans of additional documentation (such as your passport), as well as being asked to submit a proof of address.\n\n3. Place your order\n\nOnce you're verified and have deposited cash into your account, you can then begin buying Bitcoin. This process varies according to the exchange you use, with some exchanges offering a process that simply involves clicking a Buy or Sell button and then specifying how much Bitcoin you want to buy (or sell).\n\nIn general, most crypto exchanges offer at least three basic order types:\n\nMarket order : the option to choose if you simply want to buy Bitcoin at its current price. This type of order is usually completed in a matter of seconds, depending on the time of day.\n\n: the option to choose if you simply want to buy Bitcoin at its current price. This type of order is usually completed in a matter of seconds, depending on the time of day. Stop order : an order where you specify the price at which you will buy or sell Bitcoin. This type is good if you want to make sure you sell Bitcoin before it falls too sharply. This type of order can take some time to execute, depending on how quickly the market moves.\n\n: an order where you specify the price at which you will buy or sell Bitcoin. This type is good if you want to make sure you sell Bitcoin before it falls too sharply. This type of order can take some time to execute, depending on how quickly the market moves. Limit order: instructs the exchange to execute a buy or sell order at a specific price or better. In contrast to stop orders, limit orders are visible to the market and can take longer to fill.\n\nAgain, executing any one of these options usually involves clicking a Buy, Trade, or New order button on an exchange's home screen. You'll then be able to choose from the above three (and more advanced) options, before clicking a Submit button or something equivalent.\n\nQuick tip: All exchanges will let you buy a fraction of a bitcoin (BTC). So while the price of 1 BTC may seem prohibitively expensive right now, you will be able to choose to buy 0.1 BTC, 0.01 BTC or whatever else you type into the exchange's interface.\n\n4. Store your crypto in a safe place\n\nWhile bigger exchanges are becoming safer, hacks and fraud remain a big problem for the industry. This is why investors with significant sums in Bitcoin are advised to consider storing their cryptocurrency themselves.\n\n\"Experienced traders that are very good with cybersecurity might prefer to own their wallets, as this gives you the ability to move your cryptocurrencies whenever you want to and not be subject to an exchange. The saying 'Not your keys, not your coins' was popular last year, as many exchanges got hacked or shut down,\" says Moya.\n\nThis means transferring your Bitcoin from the exchange you use to your own cryptocurrency wallet. Such wallets come in two forms:\n\nCold wallets: also known as hardware wallets, these are small devices that store your Bitcoin address' private key, which is necessary to transfer Bitcoin out of the address. They do not connect to the internet and are therefore considered safer than online, software-based alternatives.\n\nalso known as hardware wallets, these are small devices that store your Bitcoin address' private key, which is necessary to transfer Bitcoin out of the address. They do not connect to the internet and are therefore considered safer than online, software-based alternatives. Hot wallets: also known as software wallets, these are apps that can be used through your phone, desktop computer, or web browser. They also store the private key of your Bitcoin address, but because they do connect to the internet, they aren't considered quite as safe as hardware/cold wallets.\n\nSoftware wallets aren't quite as secure as hardware wallets, but the leading varieties do still offer a range of security features, such as two-factor authentication and compatibility with hardware wallets.\n\nSelling bitcoin\n\nWhile many traders turn to Bitcoin in the hope of making big money fast, pretty much every analyst advocates a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy. This is largely because holding for a longer period of time tends to average out gains and losses, providing a greater probability of a significant positive return by the time you sell your Bitcoin.\n\n\"In my opinion, it is better to buy and hold, perhaps allocating a small portion of your portfolio to cryptocurrencies, focusing on the ones typically held by institutional investors, such as Bitcoin at the moment,\" says Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nLikewise, many analysts also recommend adopting a dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) strategy, largely because this is another way of averaging out peaks and troughs.\n\n\"The best strategy for newcomers would be to [trade] Bitcoin on the DCA approach [...] you'll just buy a tiny bit on a monthly or weekly basis, not looking at the price movements at all,\" says Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the CEO and founder of cryptocurrency consultancy, Eight.\n\nHowever, Moya warns that even with a long-term hold strategy, new traders are generally advised to enter the world of Bitcoin investing with the mindset that they could lose most of their money.\n\n\"A new investor should only apply a very low, single-digit percentage of their trading portfolio to cryptocurrencies. Despite the many bullish calls for Bitcoin or Ethereum, massive plunges have happened in minutes. New investors may want to consider buying and holding a basket of cryptocurrencies, with an approach of scaling into positions,\" he says.\n\nA longer-term approach is also beneficial from a tax perspective, since Bitcoin is classified as property in the US, and therefore liable to capital gains tax when sold.\n\nQuick tip: You'll have to pay capital gains tax if you sell bitcoin after holding it for more than one year. But if you hold for less than a year, your gains are taxed as ordinary income. Investors with an annual income of $40,000 or less pay no capital gains tax on Bitcoin profits, whereas those in the next bracket pay 15%.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBitcoin is an interesting and exciting technological innovation, representing a form of decentralized electronic money that doesn't require a central authority (such as the Federal Reserve) to operate. It's also exciting from an investment perspective, with its high annual returns (in most years) making it one of the best-performing assets of the past decade, even if its volatility means it has suffered more than a few dramatic falls.\n\nWhile investing in Bitcoin may seem complicated, starting off is as simple as picking a reputable exchange and setting up an account. Once you've verified your identity and deposited some money, you're then good to go, with most exchanges offering a range of order types in addition to the ability to simply buy Bitcoin.\n\nWhen you've acquired a significant sum of Bitcoin, most experts recommend withdrawing it to your own cold (i.e., hardware) wallet. They also recommend a buy-and-hold strategy, so that you can iron out market dips and also avoid having your profits taxed as ordinary income."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nBitcoin surged to its highest price in nearly 20 months while gold hit an all-time peak on Monday, as frenzied investor speculation that interest rates will fall next year rippled through assets across the globe.\n\nThe cryptocurrency soared to more than $42,000 on Monday, also boosted by optimism that the toughest regulatory punishments for the industry have passed. It later fell back to $41,662, up 7.4 per cent on the previous day.\n\nGold rallied as much as 3 per cent to $2,135 per troy ounce on Monday, a new record, before slipping to $2,025 per troy ounce, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe moves follow a recent rush into stocks and bonds, fuelled by growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve will soon cut borrowing costs despite chair Jay Powell\u2019s assertion on Friday that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to conclude that the central bank has won its battle with inflation.\n\n\u201cYou look at bitcoin and gold and you see a very similar kind of evolution,\u201d said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \u201cAll the asset classes that tend to do well when the Fed cuts rates aggressively are doing well.\u201d\n\nTraders are now betting the first rate reduction could come as soon as March after a sharp decline in government and corporate borrowing costs as US bond markets enjoyed their biggest monthly rally in nearly four decades in November.\n\nLower yields on ultra-safe US Treasury debt have made other assets relatively more attractive to investors. The S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since March 2022 last week, although it was down 0.6 per cent midway through Monday\u2019s session. Recent US economic data has been resilient even while inflation has fallen, further boosting risky assets such as stocks.\n\nMax Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC, said markets were in the grip of an \u201ceveryone-is-happy-Goldilocks rally\u201d across \u201cvirtually all asset classes\u201d.\n\nTraders said the momentum to buy bitcoin, whose value has climbed more than a fifth in the past month, was also driven by growing interest among investors after the closure of two of the most high-profile criminal cases that had hung over the market for the past year.\n\nLast month the US successfully prosecuted Sam Bankman-Fried, former chief executive of FTX, and Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud and Binance paid $4.3bn in penalties after pleading guilty to criminal charges related to money laundering and financial sanctions breaches.\n\nBut despite many traders\u2019 fears, US authorities did not shut down Binance. The cryptocurrency exchange continues to face a separate lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly violating securities laws.\n\n\u201cThe message from many institutional investors was that they needed two things before looking at the space again: closure on FTX and clarity around Binance,\u201d said Henri Arslanian, co-founder of Nine Blocks Management, a crypto hedge fund manager based in Dubai.\n\nEthereum, the second most actively traded cryptocurrency, also rose 8.3 per cent to $2,260 on Monday, its highest level since May last year.\n\nInvestors are also hopeful the SEC will approve an exchange traded fund for bitcoin in coming weeks. The regulator has refused for a decade to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, stock market funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nSome of Wall Street\u2019s largest investors, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have joined companies such as VanEck and WisdomTree in submitting filings with the SEC.\n\nThe market has long viewed spot bitcoin ETFs as a way to wrest control of digital assets from scandal-ridden crypto groups in favour of mainstream businesses such as BlackRock.\n\n\u201cETF speculation is going to continue to drive behaviour in the crypto market this week as investors buy into the narrative of the transformative impact opening the market to institutional investors will have on the ecosystem,\u201d said Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro.\n\nWhile the SEC has embarked on a year-long crackdown on crypto \u2014 including enforcement actions against groups such as US-listed exchange Coinbase \u2014 pressure is growing on the regulator to approve a bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nCrypto asset manager Grayscale scored a watershed legal victory this year when a federal appeals court ruled the SEC was wrong to reject its application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe crypto bulls are back again. Bitcoin surged to $42,000 on Monday, its highest in nearly 20 months, marking a dramatic 150 per cent rise so far this year. After losing more than 60 per cent of its value in 2022, its climb back has sparked yet another wave of euphoric calls: industry veterans now project the token will breach $100,000 by the end of 2024, and at least $750,000 by 2026. Competitors including ethereum, dogecoin, solana and cardano are all up by double-digit percentages too.\n\nAs with any instrument, the investment case for crypto hinges on finding a convincing narrative. But unlike other assets, bitcoin has no intrinsic value, nor is it backed by anything. Some may argue that gold is not much different. Yet the glossy metal has been trusted as an effective store of wealth for millennia, and has been shown to offer some protection in down markets and times of high uncertainty \u2014 living up to its status as a hedge.\n\nThe same cannot be said for bitcoin. Its most consistent facet is its inconsistency. What the cryptocurrency ultimately offers, then, is a chance to speculate on the market\u2019s sentiment towards itself. And here the current pro-bitcoin sales pitch from its evangelists appears to be three-fold.\n\nFirst, they argue, a \u201crisk-on\u201d mood has returned to financial markets. In recent weeks, investors have become increasingly convinced that the US Federal Reserve has reached the end of its interest rate-raising cycle, and that cuts will happen sooner than it is signalling. With ample liquidity, and rate expectations lower, punting for something more speculative seems appealing. And rising bitcoin prices tend to generate a buying frenzy, which reinforces itself \u2014 until it inevitably pops.\n\nThe bulls are, however, also claiming that this time it is more than just hype. The second part of their pitch is that the closure of the most high-profile criminal cases that have hung over the crypto-market for the past year is akin to a cleansing moment. Last month the US successfully prosecuted Sam Bankman-Fried, former chief executive of FTX, for fraud, while Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, pleaded guilty to charges related to money laundering and sanctions breaches.\n\nThird, crypto optimists expect signs of a possible US regulatory approval for spot bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, among others, to drive a wave of crypto fund products backed by mainstream asset managers. Wider institutional adoption by serious players, they claim, gives cryptocurrency credibility.\n\nBut the buy-and-hold case is full of holes. Crypto\u2019s brushes with the law are far from over. In the nascent industry, the authorities are still cautiously calibrating regulations and hearing legal cases. Gary Gensler, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, recently said the sector was rife with \u201cfraud, scams, bankruptcies and money laundering\u201d.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETF applications, if approved, may attract more investors who seek crypto exposure yet are fearful of theft and lost coins in digital wallets and exchanges. But they do not protect investors from crypto\u2019s volatility. As it is, Grayscale\u2019s private trusts tracking cryptocurrencies are trading at absurd multiples of their underlying value. For mainstream asset managers, ETFs are also just another way to collect fees from investors seeking crypto exposure, not necessarily a backing of the asset class itself.\n\nWhat remains of the bull case, then, is the flimsy argument that there appears to be some appetite for speculation, and that bitcoin is a speculative asset. This is basically the \u201cgreater fool theory\u201d playbook for investors: all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone silly enough to buy the asset at an even higher price. That will last, until it doesn\u2019t. Bitcoin has collapsed before; it will surely do so again.\n\nLetter in response to this editorial:\n\nBitcoin loses its lustre next to gold bullion / From Alex J Pollock, Senior Fellow, Mises Institute, Lake Forest, IL, US"

        "content": "Swiss City of Lugano Adopts Bitcoin and USDT as Payment for Taxes and Municipal Services\n\nThe city of Lugano in Switzerland has embraced digital currencies by enabling its citizens and businesses to utilize them for tax payments and municipal fees. In an official announcement on December 5, Lugano announced its acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) as payment methods for invoices issued by Lugano, using the Swiss cryptocurrency platform Bitcoin Suisse.\n\nUnder this new initiative, residents of Lugano can conveniently settle their taxes and various services by scanning the Swiss QR-bill code featured on their invoices and executing the transaction using their preferred mobile wallet and the chosen cryptocurrency.\n\nThis development is part of Lugano's broader Plan B, a collaborative venture with Tether aimed at leveraging Bitcoin technology to revolutionize the city's financial system. Bitcoin Suisse, serving as the technical partner in this integrated payment solution, supports Lugano in accepting Bitcoin and Tether payments for tax payment and other invoices related to municipal services.\n\nChief Product Officer at Bitcoin Suisse, Armin Schmid, said:\n\n\u201cIt is great to see that more and more Swiss municipalities are offering payments in cryptocurrencies as an option available to both citizens and companies, complementing traditional payment methods such as post-office counters and e-banking platforms.\u201d\n\nLugano has implemented blockchain-based solutions in the past, including integrating the Polygon chain on the MyLugano app, LVGA Points payment token, Lugano digital franc, and the 3Achain blockchain infrastructure. Other Swiss municipalities like Zug started accepting Bitcoin and Ether for tax payments from local individuals and companies in 2021, while Zermatt introduced the option to pay taxes with Bitcoin in partnership with Bitcoin Suisse in January 2020.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "A Securities and Exchange Commission filing revealed BlackRock (BLK) received $100,000 from a currently unknown seed investor for a proposed spot bitcoin ETF. Many companies, including Fidelity, Invesco, Grayscale, and others are patiently waiting for SEC approval for a spot bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 20% for the month as sentiment grows bullish for the cryptocurrency on approval hopes. Yahoo Finance Jared Blikre joins the Live show to break down the latest numbers and developments surrounding BlackRock and bitcoin.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRADLEY SMITH: We've also got to talk a little Black Rock on the morning, receiving $100,000 as seed capital for its proposed Bitcoin ETF. That was disclosed in an application to the SEC this week. The investor bought $4,000 at $25 a share in October of this year.\n\nThis comes about a month before analysts anticipate either one or more spot ETFs will get approval from regulators. For more on this, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's reporter Jared Blikre. He's here at the desk.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Brad, oh, don't let me get too comfortable.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Big day.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: This is nice.\n\nBRADLEY SMITH: Yes.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: And I do have the Wi-Fi interactive here right in front of me, of course. But I'm looking at the list of companies. You mentioned BlackRock. You look at the list of companies on the Wi-Fi interactive that currently have spot Bitcoin ETFs just waiting for approval.\n\nHere's BlackRock. Here's Grayscale, a word on them in a second. Fidelity, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, all of these guys jockeying to be the first, but it's probably going to be all of them at once except maybe Grayscale.\n\nNow, Grayscale is the entity that manages the GBTC, that's the Grayscale Bitcoin investment trust, one of the few in the world only available to private subscribers. It's a closed-end fund. They've wanted to convert it to an ETF, so they can get retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd they were the ones who filed the lawsuit and they won with respect to the SEC. They beat the SEC. But it's not clear if they're going to be among these first movers.\n\nBut as far as the date, we're looking at January 10-- January 5 to January 10. There are two different offices within the SEC that have to clear this, two different Congressional laws at work. You have the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act and you also have the 1933 Securities Act. And paperwork was just filed by BlackRock.\n\nAnd that information you were talking about, the seed investor. Who's investing in this ETF that hasn't been launched yet? Well, a seed investor. This is how you start the process.\n\nAnd so we, kind of, knew that already. It already leaked out. But this is confirmation and just another incremental step, more incremental knowledge that this is going to happen and happen soon early January.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Jared, how much of this do you think is already baked in just in terms of the excitement? And I say that with the price of Bitcoin because it has been astonishing to see the rise in the price of Bitcoin going back to the start of the year. Even within the last month, it's up another 20%. If we do see this approval, how big of a catalyst do you think?\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, you know, the old adage on Wall Street is buy the rumor, sell the news. I hope not because I'm looking at the Wi-Fi interactive, Bitcoin is the-- crypto in general it's the number one asset class of the year. I mean, forget the Magnificent Seven, Bitcoin up 152%.\n\nLet's take a look at this chart in anticipation of all of this. Arguably, this got started down here. I mean, we've been hearing about this for months, but the anticipation really led to this latest launch up. We had Bitcoin stuck at about 30,000.\n\nSo I think a lot of this news is already baked in. But I think the momentum is there to keep Bitcoin alive. I think the winter is done.\n\nI don't think we're ever going to see 20,000 again. You can quote me on that. And I think it's off to the races."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency, is gaining momentum versus global large-cap stocks, overtaking the market value of American conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway. Its market cap breached $800 billion on Dec. 4 after nudging past billionaire investor Warren Buffet\u2019s company on Dec. 3.\n\nAs Bitcoin surged past $40,000 over the weekend, its market cap rose to above $780 billion, just beating out Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s $779 billion market cap it closed the market with on Dec. 1 (based on its class A stock, BRK.A).\n\nBRK.A has seen a slight decline recently, slipping around 1.3% over the past five days. Despite the recent drop, Berkshire Hathaway is still up 4.7% over the past 30 days and 14.7% year to date (YTD).\n\nThe volatility of BRK.A is nowhere near that of Bitcoin, which has surged 20% over the past month and almost 150% YTD, according to data from CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency has been steadily hitting multimonth highs recently, surpassing $41,000 on Dec. 4 for the first time since April 2022.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap amounts to $811 billion, or 4% higher than the market value of Berkshire Hathaway. Founded in 1839, \u200b\u200bBerkshire Hathaway is a multinational holding firm headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, in the United States. \u200b\u200bBerkshire\u2019s main business is insurance, from which it invests in a big portfolio of companies, including Bank of America and Apple.\n\nCryptocurrency lawyer John Deaton took to X (formerly Twitter) to comment on the news. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty damn big bottle of rat poison,\u201d Deaton wrote, referring to the words of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Buffett, who famously called Bitcoin \u201crat poison squared\u201d in 2018.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin tops $40K for first time in 19 months, Matrixport tips $125K in 2024\n\nAccording to data from CompaniesMarketCap, Bitcoin is now the 10th-biggest asset by market cap, following Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) and Nvidia, whose market value currently stands at $834 billion and $1.2 trillion, respectively.\n\nTop assets by market cap. Source: CompaniesMarketCap\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s market cap surging past $800 billion, the cryptocurrency is now 38% short of its all-time high $69,000 price posted in November 2021.\n\nThe current bullish action could wind up marking the second time in the history of Bitcoin that its market capitalization reaches $1 trillion. Bitcoin previously broke the $1 trillion market cap in February 2021 at $53,700.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin ETF race has a new player, Binance ends support for BUSD, and more: Hodler\u2019s Digest: Nov. 26 \u2013 Dec. 2"

Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally comes amid heightened speculation that an SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF is on the anvil and would play a major role in driving the crypto market to new highs.\n\nOne of the major reasons behind this heightened speculation is the recent resolution of legal issues faced by Binance.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the largest global cryptocurrency exchange, recently agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges.

Alarm over its energy consumption, and, in turn, its greenhouse gas emissions, has prompted calls from politicians to regulate the cryptocurrency or ban it altogether.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nSwimming pools\n\nAccording to de Vries, the total \u201cwater footprint\u201d of Bitcoin in 2021 was 1,573.7 gigaliters. The Bitcoin network handled 96.7 million transactions that year, giving each transaction a water footprint of 16,279 litres.\n\nThat\u2019s enough to fill a backyard swimming pool, according to headlines in the BBC, Euronews, and New Scientist.\n\nThe methodology was straightforward: Facilities that secure the Bitcoin network in exchange for newly issued tokens, a process called \u201cmining,\u201d used a certain amount of power in 2021. Based on the geographic distribution of those facilities, de Vries estimated the source of their energy, and the amount of water those sources used.\n\nHe was, in other words, attempting to measure Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cindirect\u201d or \u201cscope 2\u2033 water use. \u201cDirect,\u201d or \u201cscope 1,\u2033 water use would involve the water used by the facility itself.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u2018Debunked\u2019\n\nCritics say de Vries\u2019 per-transaction methodology is flawed, and headlines that relied on it, misleading.\n\nBitcoin proponents such as Daniel Batten \u2014 an investor in Bitcoin mining operations powered by captured methane \u2014 point to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, which states that \u201cenergy cost per transaction is not a meaningful metric in the context of [proof-of-work] blockchains.\u201d\n\nProof-of-work is one of several technologies used to secure blockchains. In 2022, Ethereum switched to another mechanism, in part to reduce its energy consumption.\n\nA single Bitcoin transaction \u201ccan include thousands of payments,\u201d the Center for Alternative Finance said in a 2018 study. Additionally, \u201cenergy required for [proof-of-work] networks to function is independent from the number of processed transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cDe Vries is neither a scientist, nor an energy or resource expert,\u201d Batten told DL News. \u201cHe is the employee of a Central Bank, and has had his methodology of \u2018per transaction\u2019 debunked.\u201d\n\nDe Vries defended his use of the per-transaction metric.\n\n\u201cNew environmental disclosure requirements for crypto assets that are being introduced in Europe with the MiCA regulation will also specifically require efficiency metrics such as the electricity, carbon and water footprints per transaction,\u201d he told DL News.\n\n\u201cOnly a very limited fraction of Bitcoin transactions are payments, so taking transactions as payments tends to make Bitcoin look better,\u201d he added. \u201cScaling solutions such [as] the Lightning network mentioned in the article have not had any meaningful impact in altering this.\u201d\n\nDirect, or indirect?\n\nBatten also took issue with the notion that Bitcoin\u2019s total water use was somehow problematic. Indirect water consumption is \u201cnot a meaningful metric,\u201d he and others have argued.\n\n\u201cYou could write an article saying that banking, AI, search engines, construction, media \u2014 any industry you wanted uses a lot of water using the methodology he uses,\u201d Batten said.\n\n\u201cThe actual direct water-usage of Bitcoin mining, which is what I would opine a piece of honest analysis would have focused on, is very low compared to other industries such as agriculture, pulp and paper, steam assisted oil recovery and extractive mining.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s just the standard across industries, according to Kaveh Madani, director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health.\n\nMadani recently co-authored commentary on Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint, which included an estimate of its worldwide water use in 2020 and 2021. That estimate detailed Bitcoin\u2019s indirect water consumption \u2014 the water needed to generate the energy that Bitcoin used.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the correct way to do water impact calculations,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cTo calculate the water footprint of the burger you eat \u2026 we go across the supply chain: So we start from the grass, and then the cow and the truck that brings the meat to the store.\u201d\n\nDe Vries agreed.\n\n\u201cAssessing the water footprint in this way is no different than [how] we assess carbon footprints,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have defined scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to obtain a comprehensive overview on how entities impact the climate. \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s not fair\u2019 is a lame excuse for avoiding taking any responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u2018Monitored and regulated\u2019\n\nAmong other solutions to Bitcoin\u2019s outsized water usage, de Vries suggested locating Bitcoin mining facilities in places with \u201cfavourable climate conditions to minimise direct water consumption\u201d; \u201cImmersing mining devices in a dielectric fluid\u201d that can \u201cprovide cooling without relying on water\u201d; and using power sources that don\u2019t require fresh water, such as solar and wind.\n\nLike de Vries, Madani says Bitcoiners should try to find ways to reduce the network\u2019s energy and water use.\n\nStill, he too had misgivings about de Vries\u2019 commentary: For example, terms like \u201cwater footprint\u201d and \u201cwater consumption\u201d seem to be used interchangeably even though they have different, and specific meanings in environmental research \u2014 a red flag, according to Madani. (De Vries said his commentary \u201cspecifies the definitions of water consumption and water footprint in this article, essentially limiting what is considered as the water footprint and making the two terms interchangeable. Considering the full water footprint as understood by common definitions may result in a larger number.\u201d)\n\nAnd he wants researchers to find a way to communicate without antagonising the industry, lest it alienate its natural audience.\n\n\u201cWe have to be extremely careful about the metrics that we present to the public, and the potential interpretation of those metrics,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cResearch like this should deliver the message in a way that people do not think scientists are against technological disruptions, especially the positive ones. The goal here is to highlight some impacts that need to be monitored and regulated.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged past $41,000 Monday morning, with some investors speculating the Federal Reserve could be done raising rates and hopes that a spot bitcoin ETF approval could cause the cryptocurrency to rise even further. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith breaks down the rally and the outlook for the cryptocurrency.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, taking a look at Bitcoin climbing higher today, jumping above $41,000 after briefly climbing as high as $42,000 as investors speculate the likelihood of a spot ETF and bet big on the end of rate hikes. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith is here to talk about these recent moves. So David, there is some positivity fueling the hype. But historically, how has Bitcoin performed to the closed out the year?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. Rachelle, absolutely. You know, right now Bitcoin is up about 150% year-to-date. So it's on pace to have its second best year of performance for the past six years. So if we look back at 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, we're seeing in 2019, it was up about 90%. 2020 is obviously the biggest year on record for what we have.\n\nAnd then 2022, last year was the biggest drop. And Bitcoin has had bigger drops in the past, but it kind of highlights what 2023 has been. It's been sort of an outrageous recovery of the asset despite a lot of regulatory uncertainty at least in the US.\n\nSo right now, since Bitcoin has crossed the $42,000 mark earlier this morning, it's set to basically where the price was trading before a lot of the calamity in the industry took place in the spring of last year, which led to a number of blow ups and that sort of reset and also a lot of regulatory crackdowns in the US, which sort of started the beginning of this year of how we saw the market sort of changing.\n\nSo as far as what's going on next year, I think that there's a lot of hopes about next year in terms of the macroeconomic environment and also some industry-specific things a little bit less regulatory risks in some areas that are leading traders to be a lot more optimistic about it.\n\nStory continues\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: So David, can we talk about that optimism? I mean, there are some calls right now that are pretty bullish. $100,000 going into 2024?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure about the calls. But you know, I think essentially what you have is you have this Bitcoin spot ETF, which has been the story for many months. And that's become increasingly optimistic, at least from a trader standpoint. And that's because the SEC is-- we have reports that the SEC is actually engaging with some of the people who are applying to issue.\n\nSo it looks like those conversations are still happening. So that might be on the table. Then we also have this everything rally that's happening across markets where people are getting more optimistic about the Federal Reserve being finished with interest rate hikes and the cuts could even be coming next year.\n\nAnd then we also have Binance recently had their settlement with the Justice Department. And that was hanging over the market as sort of one of the known last shoes to drop in the industry in terms of all the things that happened last year. FTX going bankrupt obviously being the largest sort of taking some of the risk out of the market. And so that's opening up more investors to look at crypto again and feel a little bit more comfortable with what's going on.\n\nAnd then the other thing Bitcoin has a supply cut that's coming next year too. So that means that the issuance will be cut. And this has usually preceded a rally in Bitcoin for the following year. So that's another thing that Bitcoin believers are really optimistic about.\n\nSo all that to say a lot of potential tailwinds, but then also too there's a lot of court cases still going on with the SEC and other companies. Coinbase and Binance both still in the courts. And you know, neither of those cases will be finished anytime soon. So plenty of uncertainty, but it seems like a lot more optimism in the recent weeks.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Uncertainty and volatility seems to be certainly the steady word there around Bitcoin. But we'll be watching. David Hollerith, thanks so much for that."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele has reported that the government\u2019s Bitcoin investments are in profit.\n\nWith holdings worth around $131M, the government has paid an average price of just over $40,000 per coin since it started buying BTC in 2021.\n\nBukele has used the news to denounce previous criticism of the country\u2019s Bitcoin policies.\n\nIt has now been over 2 years since El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender \u2013 a bold policy promoted by President Nayib Bukele. Since then, the decision has been subject to intense domestic and international criticism, often due to unrealized losses from the government\u2019s own BTC investments.\n\nHowever, after the latest crypto market rally, Bukele has reported that El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin investments are finally in the black.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Holds BTC Worth $131M\n\nAfter buying large amounts of BTC in the $45,000\u2013$60,000 range back in 2021/2022, the government of El Salvador saw the value of its holdings plummet throughout the prolonged crypto winter that followed.\n\nYet, throughout the 2022 bear market, Bukele\u2019s government continued to buy. Significantly, its last major purchase in December 2022 occurred near the bottom of the market. From a high of around $55,000, that investment helped bring the average price paid for Bitcoin in its portfolio down to just above $40,000.\n\nEl Salvador's #Bitcoin investments are in the black! After literally thousands of articles and hit pieces that ridiculed our supposed losses, all of which were calculated based on #Bitcoin \u2019s market price at the time\u2026 With the current #Bitcoin market price, if we were to sell\u2026 pic.twitter.com/gvl2GfQMfb \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 4, 2023\n\nAccordingly, with the cryptocurrency\u2019s price climbing above $40,000 on Monday, Bukele reported that El Salvador\u2019s BTC holdings were worth nearly $131M, representing a net profit of $3.6M.\n\nCommenting on the news, Bukele denounced the \u201cthousands of articles and hit pieces\u201d that had criticized the government for its earlier losses and called for the retraction of previous criticisms.\n\nWill The Government Sell Its Bitcoin?\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin has risen in 2023, El Salvador\u2019s economic outlook has improved. If the value of its reserves continues to grow, the government could sell its BTC at a tidy profit. But Bukele insisted that \u201cwe have no intention of selling.\u201d\n\n#Bitcoin | Estrategia de inversi\u00f3n del Presidente @nayibbukele en bitcoin genera m\u00e1s de $3.5 millones en ganancias.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged past $42,000 following reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve a spot bitcoin ETF in January. The crypto rally comes even as crypto lending firm Nexo faced SEC fines, though Nexo Co-Founder Antoni Trenchev remains focused on building out crypto infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance, Trenchev says the crypto market is sending \"mixed signals\" lately. Trenchev is optimistic in the long term as events in the crypto space, like Binance's settlement and hopefulness on a bitcoin ETF approval, illustrate different paths for regulation.\n\nHe states the crypto shakeout after FTX's collapse has weeded out \"weak hands,\" allowing resilient assets like bitcoin to rebound. With momentum regaining in the digital asset, Trenchev sees a spot ETF as increasingly attractive. He even predicts Bitcoin could reach $100,000.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: For more on the crypto sector, let's get to Antoni Trenchev, Nexo co-founder. Antoni, good to talk to you today. You certainly haven't been immune from the shakedown that has played out within the crypto sector. You had to take down a $45 million fine from the SEC. As you think about where crypto is today compared to pre-FTX collapse, pre what happened with Binance, how has that changed your strategy? How has that changed your thinking about how Nexo moves forward?\n\nANTONI TRENCHEV: Well, we have been very focused on building out the infrastructure. This is the great thing about bear markets, that you can refine your product, your infrastructure, whether it means technology or the legal aspects, licensing, and underpinning what underpins the enterprise. That's what have been very focused on this past few years and increasingly.\n\nSo after the FTX collapse, right now, I think we are in a sort of a situation where we have mixed signals. On the one side, we have all the positive things that have happened in the space, you know, the settlement that Binance has, the Bitcoin spot ETF that appears to be around the corner. And I'm certainly in the camp of believers. And then we have some messages from the Treasury from the SEC that they continue to be quite aggressive on crypto, and we have to see how it plays out. But ultimately, I'm very optimistic here.\n\nStory continues\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And actually, we have to talk about this rally that we've seen. How much of that is just about this hype around the spot Bitcoin ETF being approved versus looking further ahead to the Bitcoin halving event in 2024?\n\nANTONI TRENCHEV: Well, I think it's both. I think Bitcoin is sound fundamentally in the sense that we saw a deleveraging after the FTX collapse. We saw a shakeout of the weak hands, and Bitcoin has been transferred to stronger diamond hands, which now will hold on forever, that on the one side. And then just, like, structurally from a market perspective, we have everybody write Bitcoin off. It was like shows like yours all but stopped talking about Bitcoin for a few months.\n\nAnd this also tells you a little bit about sentiment. And Bitcoin having this pre-programmed disinflationary mechanism that Bitcoin has and built in its code, I think it strikes a right note in this inflationary times. And you know, I think this, garnered with the Bitcoin spot ETF frenzy, is what is ultimately going to propel us from here, if we can hold the 42 level, which is very important, up to 50 in the short-term. Then there might be some correction and some profit taking and sell the news type of event. But then, until the end of year, I definitely could see it go up to 100k at the end of 2024.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: 100,000 by the end of the year, what's the catalyst?\n\nANTONI TRENCHEV: Well, the catalyst would be the Bitcoin halving. This is certainly what we saw in 2022 when it occurred around the mid of May. Some caution here for your viewers, who are about to go in long in crypto with the funds from the college tuitions for their children. Before that, we saw an intraday tank of 50% just prior to the halving, just a few months before that in 2022.\n\nSo crypto is not a one-way street, but I do see the Bitcoin ETF as an institutional draw, the draw of institutional money. And then the halving will be a huge event. And then if and when the Fed pivots from its very aggressive hiking cycle, and it plateaus out or even starts cutting rates, this will be the ultimate impetus for all risk-on assets, of which Bitcoin is the par excellence."

        "content": "So joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is innovating capital, general partner and Pastel Network co-founder, Anthony Georgiadis. Welcome back, Anthony, thanks for having me on. Glad to see you again. So Bitcoin breaking above uh that 40,000 mark now as a forehand uh last we checked uh what do you think is driving this year? Yeah, there's a, there's a lot going on right now. It's obviously exciting to see. I think first and foremost is, you know, you mentioned obviously the terror collapse of a couple of years ago and really how we haven't seen these prices since pre terror. But I think, you know, really what to go back in time a little bit here, what's been driving the price um downward and what we've seen in terms of a lot of the overall selling pressure over the last year or so. And really what drove the tar collapse has been obviously a lot of hawkish policy from the fed. I think over the last several months, it's become very, very clear that monetary policy has probably reached a point of of tapering. We're going to start to see potentially rating rate reductions and a couple, excuse me, couple rate reductions next year. Um With CP I and and corn actually really cooling off in a positive way in tandem with that. Um Obviously, you know, you can look at the price of gold in the last couple of days here, we have increasing global pressures around the world, increased macroeconomic strains and you know, in tandem with some of the shift in monetary policy, um a lot of institutional investors in sovereign states are looking towards more safe haven and deflationary assets in terms of overall portfolio allocation and broader diversification. The last point as well as obviously a lot of the broader sentiment. Um that's really kind of ramped up with regards to some of the ETF applications and potentially regulatory softening that will pave the way for those applications to really be pushed through and you know, to make it clear spot. ETF S not necessarily the traditional futures based ETF S that we've seen historically. So this is this is the part that I'm trying to grapple with here. Gold, as you mentioned all time, high gold is the ultimate safe haven since I don't know, uh Sumer Sumerian Times. I mean, this is this is where people went Bitcoin for several years was considered the ultimate risk on asset. It was a bet on the future of money, a different type of money. Yet they are both now at all that they're both now at highs. I don't want to say Bitcoins at an all time high, strip away the bubbles of, say US T and the bubble of FTX and all of a sudden you've got, yeah, one could argue that this is maybe more of a real high than those highs before I'll get to that in a second. How does that make sense though? Risk on versus safe haven both at highs at a time when the fed? Even though, uh, we're, we're talking about maybe this might be uh the, the rate hikes might have come to an end. We're not 100% certain because Powell said, don't take that off the table yet. It doesn't all jive does it, is there something else fundamentally happening in crypto other than the spot ETF argument? Because that, that's a different story as well? But is there something that has to do with the market structure of Bitcoin and how and how it's traded such as the change in what's going on in the largest centralized exchange? Binance having an effect on the price now? Mhm. Well, you know, first, even with an asset like gold, it's not as clear cut and dry as safe haven versus risk on right, in a lower interest rate environment, the opportunity cost of holding a non-interest bearing asset such as gold is dramatically reduced, which is why we've obviously seen historically speaking and right now, um with the forward looking forecast of potentially rate reductions, the spot gold prices reaching record highs. And you put that in tandem with obviously some of the global pressures that we discussed and really the appetite towards moving towards something that is very much so a safe haven asset. Now, with respect to Bitcoin, it does certainly demonstrate those very two distinct characteristics. When you're buying into Bitcoin, you're buying into the potential future growth that an asset such as this might hold, you know, the world of web three digital based economies, uh peer to peer transactions, whatever it might be. And obviously, that behaves very much similar to a tech equity with a certain level of risk on characteristics. And it's going to stand to benefit from monetary policy that's moving towards Dovish sentiment on the flip side. It's very clear that Bitcoin and it happens with, you know, every having as something that's actually coming up. Um in April of next year, Bitcoin has taken on the characteristics of truly being a deflationary asset and decentralized money. Um obviously on the backing of the financial banking coll that we saw earlier this year with continue global tensions across the world. Um whether it's in Asia or Europe or wherever it might be, there is a strong sentiment and demand to diversify away from sovereign bank based currencies directly. So I really think the important thing we had one whale by about half a bi it seems and this is from uh stuff that we've reported on coin desk, we had a whale by about half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin. And I think this is what I'm getting at. Um That, that's, that's not small. It's on the other hand, relative to the rest of the assets in the world, half a billion dollars that, that's pocket change uh in, let's say treasuries nonetheless, in Bitcoin, that, that matters what is going on there. That's, that would cause one particular whale or, and by whale, it could be institution, it could be whatever, what would cause one individual buyer to go out and purchase that much Bitcoin unless there's something going on other than it doesn't seem to jive this idea. Well, it's macro it's micro like what's going on, do we know? Yeah. Well, I mean, listen, I mean, the the tip of the curve here is that we are looking like we're going to be seeing a 180 degree uh reaction in terms of monetary policy. So I think building up to that and obviously the anticipation, you know, if you look at where the yield curve is right now, it's very clear that we think and obviously private credit has been a tremendous beneficiary of this as well. Um It's very clear that rates are probably going to come down much faster than we anticipated and there is going to be massive risk on sentiment moving forward. You know, I do want to make a point though, you know, as you mentioned, with some of these whales that are going out and acquiring a ton of Bitcoin. What's unique about this is yes, there is that speculative component here. But I think that there is also the long term asset positioning in portfolios that is taking place today that may have not taken place in previous cycles. And what I mean by that is I am getting calls from some of our investors for the first time ever. Not asking me necessarily how to go buy Bitcoin, but how to actually self custody it because they're looking to acquire Bitcoin, they're looking to take it off exchanges and hold it in cold wallets with the purpose and intent of holding it really into perpetuity. And I think it's a very distinct phase that we're in right now in terms of how institutions and investors are obviously thinking through portfolio positioning, but also through the actual acquisition and long term exposure to this asset class. I want to talk about Ether quickly before we wrap this. It's also up almost 4% this morning, up over $2200. What do you think is driving interest in Ether? Especially since NFT indexes are down NFT volumes are down and during the last last bull market, the narrative between Ether and NFTS was very different. Mhm. Mhm. Well, one thing I do want to note is that the NFT market is seeing a bit of a resurgence specifically within the Solana ecosystem. So yes, there has been some contraction with respect to NFTS and the Ethereum ecosystem and has, as we know them today. Um you know, that being said in the world of Ethereum, um there has been a ton of innovation and marketable opportunities with respect to layer two scaling solutions um as well as a variety of web three applications. Ethereum is, you know, really this global computer of sorts that's gonna power the next wave of internet based businesses in this web three world. And I think for the most part, we've seen a tremendous amount of broader user growth, not necessarily specifically in NFTS, but across defi gaming, real world applications um as well as technological advancements that make a lot of these applications much more competitive with the broader web two world. So a lot of that is coming together right now and I think that the market is certainly paying attention to that."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are currently worth nearly $2B more than what the company paid.\n\nUnder CEO Michael Saylor\u2019s leadership, the company has been continuously stacking BTC since 2020.\n\nIn November, MicroStrategy bought 16,130 BTC at an average price of $36,785 per coin.\n\nWhen MicroStrategy started investing in Bitcoin in 2020, CEO Michael Saylor lauded the cryptocurrency as a \u201cdependable store of value and an attractive investment asset.\u201d\n\nAt the end of November, MicroStrategy was sitting on Bitcoin worth over $7.2B, nearly $2B more than what it paid, cementing the firm\u2019s position as the world\u2019s largest BTC whale and seeming to validate Saylor\u2019s enduring bullishness.\n\nMicroStrategy Keeps On Buying\n\nIn a recent post on X, Saylor revealed that Microstrategy purchased 16,130 BTC in November at an average price of $36,785 per coin. Since it started investing in the cryptocurrency, MicroStrategy has paid an average of $30,252 per BTC.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 16,130 BTC for ~$593.3 million at an average price of $36,785 per #bitcoin . As of 11/29/23, @MicroStrategy now hodls 174,530 $BTC acquired for ~$5.28 billion at an average price of $30,252 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/hSEZyzGBsr \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) November 30, 2023\n\nNovember\u2019s acquisitions represent Microstrategy\u2019s largest monthly BTC purchases since investing $1B in February 2021. The recent spending spree has been especially prominent, but month after month, through bull and bear markets, the company has rarely stopped buying Bitcoin, even borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars to fund its purchases.\n\nAfter crypto markets flatlined for most of the summer, at one point in September, Microstrategy had unrealized losses of around $500M from its Bitcoin investments.\n\nIn the long run, however, temporary losses could arguably be justified in the name of buying the dip. And for now, at least, Saylor\u2019s strategy has paid off, with investments made when BTC was trading below $30,000 up 30% or more.\n\nShare Price Rallies As MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC Holdings Swell\n\nMicroStrategy now owns so much BTC that it could soon control 1% of the total supply. According to Saylor\u2019s latest announcement, the company holds 144,530 coins, representing nearly 0.74% of the circulating supply of around 19.56M BTC on December 4.\n\nGiven its massive crypto hoard, MicroStrategy\u2019s share price has surged by around 275% in 2023, rising with the price of BTC.\n\nMicroStrategy share price.\n\nSignificantly, the company\u2019s stock market performance throughout the year closely tracks the ups and downs of the crypto market. For example, MicroStrategy stock witnessed a major jump as Bitcoin rallied in mid-October."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin Surged Higher This Weekend - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What a weekend it has been in the crypto world. Three of the world's largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC -4.36%), Ethereum (ETH -5.13%), and Dogecoin (DOGE 2.06%), have seen impressive rallies, with a few key psychological thresholds broken through. As of noon ET, these three tokens are up 5.8%, 6.4% and 6.4%, respectively, since Friday at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nGiven the rapidly changing economic backdrop and volatility we've seen in everything from bond yields (discount rates) to alternative asset prices, it's wroth diving into what's catalyzing these moves today.\n\nWhat's driving this rally?\n\nBitcoin's rally to more than $42,000 per token in early trading this morning represented the largest level the megacap cryptocurrency has seen since early 2022. Interestingly, this move in Bitcoin has been correlated to a surge in the price of spot gold, which recently broke through a record high of $2,100 earlier today, as investors appear to be increasing their bets that inflation could pick up.\n\nSinking bond yields and heightened geopolitical concerns appear to be driving investors to alternative assets, such as Bitcoin, propping up the entire sector today. Additional interest continues to form around Bitcoin due to its upcoming halving event, which is anticipated to take place in 2024, as well as capital inflows from incoming spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe direction Bitcoin moves often informs how Ethereum performs on a given day, and certainly some of Ether's recent rise can be attributed to this bullish narrative forming in alternative assets. However, Ethereum has also benefited from some token-specific catalysts worth pointing out. Most notably, Mantle has rolled out a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum's main network, suggesting that the Ethereum staking markets could become more decentralized. Ethereum's price has surged above $2,200 per token at the time of writing, marking a high not seen since mid-2022 as well.\n\nFinally, Dogecoin's rally appears to be closely correlated to the broader move in the overall sector, with speculators and traders continuing to focus on this meme coin as a way to play the crypto sector's momentum in either direction. This correlation can be seen in the liquidation data for Dogecoin, with roughly $2 million of perpetual futures contracts liquidated yesterday, one of the largest spikes we've seen in recent months.\n\nAre these cryptos worth buying into at year end?\n\nFor investors seeking diversification or are particularly interested in hedging some of their equity exposure with alternative assets, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain top of mind (in addition to gold, of course) as ways of both generating better alpha (higher returns) during bull markets, and potentially providing some downside protection via these assets' lower beta (lower correlation moves) in down cycles.\n\nThat said, the 2022 bear market highlighted some of the risks of putting cryptos in the same bucket as other alternative assets. Gold and other commodities performed much better than crypto last year, so betting on these digital assets as any sort of hedge against uncertainty is still a strategy that's unproven (considering the world's first crypto, Bitcoin, was conceived post-great financial crisis).\n\nOverall, these three tokens certainly appear to reflect a growing consensus that some sort of soft-ish landing is ahead. While I'm not as certain as many of the top economists and talking heads that such a landing can be achieved, it's possible. And for those looking for a way to ride any positive momentum right now, these three assets are certainly in high demand.\n\nI'm remaining cautious on crypto until there's more clarity, but I can also certainly see why investor positioning is favoring these assets right now."

Bitcoin\u2019s price had been toying with the $40,000 level in recent days, and finally breached it Monday to trade above $41,600 as of press time, according to CoinDesk Indices data, a 24-hour rise of about 6%. Ether was trading around $2,240, a similar percentage gain. The advance spurred crypto stocks higher, too. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) jumped almost 9% in pre-market trading, as did Microstrategy (MSTR). Crypto miners such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot (RIOT) added more than 10%. The other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization marked smaller gains, and BNB coin (BNB), a token affiliated with the Binance exchange, was little changed."

        "title": "Bitcoin Ecosystem Developments in 2023 as BTC Hits Fresh 2023 High - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Joining us now to reflect on Bitcoin's developments in 2023 is CEO of Bitcoin financial services firm Swan Corey Clipston Al Long with co-founder of Stax at Bitcoin Lay two protocol for smart contracts. M Ali. Welcome to the show, Corey and mane. Great to be here. Thanks for having me. Awesome. Thanks. Thanks for having me. Good to see you, Corey. You as well, sir. All right, awesome. Let's get into it. As we know Bitcoin is hitting highs that we haven't seen in over a year. Corey, I want to start with you when you reflect on 2023. What's the most exciting development that's happened for the Bitcoin network? Yeah. So overall for the ecosystem, I'd say the most exciting thing that's going on and I've been talking about this a lot lately is the replacement of the top of funnel for new people getting into Bitcoin the last six years. It's been the world of VC funded crypto, non Bitcoin crypto trying to pump their tokens and, and spend $50 billion of VC funding on marketing. And now that's getting replaced with the largest, most trusted financial firms in the world. Talking about Bitcoin itself. So when you think about maybe the end goal for a company like ours or just for the Bitcoin ecosystem of getting people to take self custody of their Bitcoin and actually understand deeply what it is as a money and as a technology, it's a much better top of funnel that we are swapping and, uh, right now and I think that remains dramatically, uh, underpriced. Um, just swapping out. Does this mean that you, uh, I, I mean, I kinda know your answer here. It is there almost no room for ALTs? Oh, hi, Lawrence. Good to see you as well. Uh, you know, people, people love to gamble and they love lotto tickets and they love playing numbers and they love casinos and I think, you know, if anything, we've seen that human nature doesn't really change and you don't need much more than a meme to attack to, uh, you know, a security or a gambling proposition of some sort and people will play it. So it's really just a matter of, of, you know, letting that kind of run its course. What I do really like and what I think is it has been achieved over the last couple of years is almost anybody that gets into this space at this point and everybody that's in the space already really does have a pretty clear demarcation between Bitcoin and non Bitcoin crypto in their mind and there isn't really any sort of meme about any of the alt coins ever being a better money than Bitcoin. So it's kind of separated itself and in the minds of everybody in the industry. And I think that's really clear when people come into the space. Now, that's the information that they're getting from all sources, from media, from government, from everyone in the industry, everybody on Twitter. And I think that was a heck of accomplishment over the last couple of years by people working their butts off in Bitcoin. Man. I want to turn to you now when it comes to the development of the network, what what's the most prominent thing that happened in 2023 that sticks out in your mind? Yeah, I think 2023 in my view was actually one of the best years for Bitcoin. Um and it like probably in the last 10 years. So I started in 2013 and I would, I would rank 2023 as the best year for Bitcoin. And I think it's mostly for two big reasons uh with things like Cardinals and Bitcoin LWS, we actually started seeing uh competition for block space and which is extremely important, right? Like if you look outside of the Bitcoin world and the rest of the industry, some of the biggest criticisms for Bitcoin would be like around the security budget that how are you going to pay for Bitcoin security in the long term? When, when the Coinbase rewards go down or there would be criticism around developer activity like, hey, how many developers are you guys getting, how many start ups are getting started and people building on Bitcoin? And now there is like real data out there because of oral where Bitcoin fees have actually flipped Ethereum in the, in the last weeks, which is huge, right? Like we were nowhere close to this two years ago. And I think similarly, we are now seeing that there are more transactions happening on the Bitcoin network that are cardinals and other things than, than just the payments and stuff which which has just opened up everyone's eyes to, hey, what else is possible on Bitcoin? And that thing is very important in trying to build a Bitcoin circular economy. And we have seen the interest in Bitcoin L twos just go through the roof. I think there are like 10 plus different projects that got started. And and I'm of the view, obviously, Stax is is doing a major upgrade trying to be close to a Bitcoin L two and have BT C as the main asset that gets used there. But there are new projects that are starting like people are trying to bring ZK roll ups to Bitcoin. People are trying to start different types of L two S and I think we need that experimentation. So for me, the biggest thing that happened in 2023 was developer activity and with things like cardinals the demand for Bitcoin block space just going through the roof. And I think that just solidifies Bitcoin at the number one spot instead of like worrying about other, other networks that are gaining more developers or gaining more users and, and, and getting these applications that that other network, I assume uh would be Ethereum. And, and uh what does this all mean for Ethereum layer two? What does it all mean for is Bitcoin taking those developers away as you, as you're saying, is that, is that what you're implying here? I think, I think we're seeing clear evidence, right? There, there were top NFT marketplaces that were on Ethereum and they switched their focus to Bitcoin. They, they started focusing on Bitcoin. We are seeing a lot of developers like when a new developer starts in this industry, I think the mental model should be that we are in an industry that's expanding but rapidly expanding and new people are entering it all the time when people were entering this year. I think building on Bitcoin was a serious option that they were concerned, right? Even if there are more still more infrastructure challenges or or depth tooling that needs to be built on Bitcoin, people are getting it that Bitcoin is the the Pristine asset as Corey was saying like, you know, but Bitcoin is separated itself as an asset. We were trying to see how Ethereum was trying to be ultrasound money and we are seeing that fade away compared to Bitcoin the asset. But Bitcoin has a technology platform where developers can come and build anything. I think it's ok to admit that other networks like Ethereum or Solana were doing a better job there. So now that's maybe no longer the case that much, right? Things are getting good or better, very, very rapidly. And that's a really good thing for Bitcoin because now when new developers, fresh talent comes in, they look at the great properties of Bitcoin, but the downsides aren't that big anymore, right? So they would, they would they are more likely to decide to build on Bitcoin. And we've seen a rapid increase the number of start ups just in our ecosystem or the broader Bitcoin L one ecosystem getting funded, hiring great developers and building building cool things. And I think that that just makes me really excited. Well, Corey man is talking about new developers, I want to talk about new uh new investors, new, new folks who want to dabble with Bitcoin after the implosion of FTX and now finance settling with the DOJ here in the United States. Uh How has that affected users on Swan? Do have you seen new users or is it the same people who've been there for a while who are interacting with the platform? Yeah, it's, it's hard to parse where the influx of new users comes from like is it people fleeing crypto or is it just new people getting drawn in as they always do by a price rise. But yeah, we've certainly seen a massive influx in users with this price rise from, you know, 25 K up to over 40 k now. Uh As always happens when there's a price pump. Uh The nice thing about Swan is even when the price drops. Uh we have a lot of folks that see that as Bitcoin on sale and so it doesn't really uh negatively affect our volumes unless it's sort of down sideways for, for years or more. Um So yeah, it is, it is a very, very exciting time and again, the signal around Bitcoin has never been stronger. And yeah, you even have the, the crypto inclined or the alt coin crowd uh actually promoting Bitcoin as well as we noted. Uh So it is, it is kind of an interesting moment in time here, uh rounding out 2023 and again, heading into the very good likelihood of some ETF S getting approved in January. Uh It's just a lot of tailwinds here for Bitcoin."

        "content": "Bitcoin Above $41K \u2013 Why Is It Going Up?\n\nBitcoin has put in another yearly high today and briefly crossed $42,000.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin up ~60% over the last two months? And where does this rally end?\n\nHere\u2019s all you need to know\u2026\n\nWhy Bitcoin Suddenly Catapulted to Highs\n\nThe last time Bitcoin traded above $40K was before the Terra crash.\n\nAnd there are several reasons for this sudden price explosion!\n\nThe biggest narrative is surely the spot Bitcoin ETF, which could unlock as much as $70B in new demand for Bitcoin.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF timeline indicates an approval could come between Jan 5 and Jan 10. Bloomberg senior analysts are putting the chances of approval at over 90%.\n\nBut Bitcoin is also benefiting from macro tailwinds. The inflation top seems to be in and the Fed has stopped hiking rates. In fact, the consensus opinion is that the Fed will cut rates in 2024 \u2013 and it could be as much as a 2.75% decrease over the year, according to UBS. Interest rates have a strong effect on crypto markets. The lower the interest rate, the better for crypto.\n\nRead also: Rate Hikes and the Fed \u2013 How Do They Affect Crypto Markets?\n\nAnd then there is the halving. This supply shock has traditionally been bullish for Bitcoin. With more demand from institutional investors and less supply thanks to the halving, the chances of a 2024 bull run look great.\n\nBut how long will this rally last?\n\n$45K By New Year?\n\nMarkus Thielen, research head at crypto services provider Matrixport and founder of analytics portal DeFi Research, told CoinDesk that Bitcoin could reach $45K by the end of the year. Options traders are positioned bullishly and futures markets have opened new premiums, which hints at potential short-term gains to come.\n\nTraders on Crypto Twitter are also mostly bullish. $46K seems to be in play, according to Bluntz Capital:\n\nPeter Schiff, who enjoyed a gold rally along with the Bitcoin rally is (of course) bearish. Another potential indicator for more gains?\n\nThe CMC Fear & Greed Index is at 75, indicating greed but not extreme greed just yet. There seems to be still a bit more room to run for Bitcoin:\n\nStory continues\n\nBut what happens next if the spot ETF gets approved?\n\nThe 2024 Outlook for Bitcoin\n\nThe consensus in the industry is that 2024 will be even more bullish than 2023.\n\nDebt burdens in several states are rising, which is prompting a flight into hard assets: gold, real estate and Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin already put in all-time highs in softer currencies like the Argentine Peso or the Turkish Lira. Talks of the Supercycle are back on the table on Crypto Twitter:\n\nBut could the spot ETF approval (if it is approved) be a \u2018sell the news\u2019 event?\n\nIt could, says venture capitalist Chris Burniske:\n\nFor starters, a spot ETF approval would not mean BlackRock and friends start buying Bitcoin right away. It would take some time to get the financial plumbing done for the funds to start allocating.\n\nFurthermore, we don\u2019t know how much BlackRock and other ETF issuers will allocate. It will be a sizeable position but just how much is guesswork on part of analysts. Once euphoria from the ETF subsides, market participants may find that allocations could take longer and be smaller than expected.\n\nEither way, Bitcoin and Ethereum look firmly bullish for 2024. Remember, BlackRock filed for an Ethereum ETF as well. Congrats to everybody who survived the bear market.\n\nWe are so back!"

        "content": "Bitcoin has experienced a 150% surge in value throughout the year, reaching over $42,000 early Monday morning. This explosive growth comes amidst mounting anticipation surrounding the potential launch of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nThe main contributing factor to Bitcoin's recent surge, in addition to the halving event approaching amongst other bullish developments, appears to be the mounting speculation surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by regulatory authorities in the United States. Such an ETF, if approved, would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to spot Bitcoin, potentially boosting the price of the asset.\n\n\"Money will flood into the industry with a Bitcoin ETF, it's just easy to buy it,\" said Tom Farley, the former President of the New York Stock Exchange on CNBC a couple weeks ago. \"People believe in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a great invention. It is a store of value.\"\n\nMarket analysts have been repeatedly beating the drum on that the introduction of an ETF would attract a fresh influx of institutional investments, further bolstering Bitcoin's position as a mainstream asset class.\n\nLast Thursday, $250 billion asset manager founder Ric Edelman said financial advisors are waiting for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be approved before providing their clients exposure to BTC.\n\nThis past Friday, Grayscale stated \"we believe that regulatory approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is a matter of 'when', not a matter of 'if'.\" The next day, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that the next window of potential ETF approvals is now January 5-10, 2024. \"Really this means that any potential approval orders are going to come on either Monday Jan 8, Tuesday Jan 9, or Wednesday Jan 10,\" he explained. \"Mark your calendars people.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "00:00\n\nANNOUNCER: THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECHNOLOGY WITH CAROLINE HYDE AND ED LUDLOW. \u266a CAROLINE: I'M CAROLINE HYDE. ED: THIS IS BLOOMBERG TECHNOLOGY. CAROLYN: SPOTIFY FLASHES WORKFORCE BY 70% AMID THE COMPANY'S STEEPEST CUTS THIS YEAR. WE BREAK DOWN THE PUSH TO COSTS AND DRIVE PROFITABILITY. ED: PLUS, BITCOIN TOPPING 42,000 U.S. DOLLARS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE APRIL OF 2022. WE WILL DISCUSS WHAT IT MEANS THAT THE DIGITAL CURRENCY ECOSYSTEM IN TODAY'S SPOTLIGHT. CAROLINE: WE SIT DOWN WITH THE OCULUS CREATOR SE UNVEILS A TINY REUSABLE FIGHTER JET TO BLOWUP DRONES. ALL THAT AND SO MUCH MORE AHEAD. WE ARE IN SELLOFF MODE. BASICALLY WE ARE JUST GETTING BACK TO THE LEVELS WE WERE OUT ON THURSDAY. SUCH HAS BEEN THE DRIVE HIGHER IN RISK ASSETS. JUST REASSESSING HOW MUCH WE HAVE RUN UP ALREADY BUT REALLY THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND A LOT OF THE JOBS DATA. CLEARLY SEEING A SELLOFF IN BONDS AND STOCKS. BLOOMBERG DOLLAR INDEX ON THE HIGHER SIDE AFTER SEEING SUCH WEAKNESS THIS YEAR. THE STRENGTH IN THE U.S. DOLLAR IS NOT OUT MATCHING THE STRENGTH OF BITCOIN. WE ARE GOING TO DWELL ON THIS A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE SHOW MUCH MORE OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW PIERCING ABOUT 2000 AND ONE POINT, 41.5, LA SCALA. WILL THE PROCESS NEXT YEAR DRIVE DEMAND FURTHER? THIS IS ABOUT RISK AS THE DEMAND AS WELL, ISN'T IT? > > IT'S INTERESTING THAT ON DAYS LIKE TODAY WHERE EQUITIES ARE PROBABLY LOWER, TO COIN IS HIGHER, BUT SO ARE CRYPTO-RELATED DOCS. THERE ARE TWO RATIONALES. IT IS A PROXY FOR WALL STREET TO GET SOME EXPOSURE WITHOUT INVESTING IN THEM DIRECTLY BY INVESTING IN STOCKS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO IT, FORGET THE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THESE EQUITIES DOES WELL, THEY DO WELL AS WELL. THESE ARE BIG MOVES ON THE SINGLE NAMES, A DAY WHERE EQUITIES ARE LOWER. CAROLINE: WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT USED FOR LACK OF VOLATILITY. WE WERE USED TO THINGS SWINGING ABOUT BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE POINTS. WE ARE STILL WAY OFF THE 69 THOUSAND DOLLARS LEVEL IN PREVIOUS HIGHS. WE ARE BACK PRIOR TO THE TARA LUNA DEBACLE. ALL OF THIS SLOWLY REBUILDING CONFIDENCE IN THE ECOSYSTEM. > > WE'VE HAD GUESTS SAYING $60,000 NEXT YEAR, 00,000 MAYBE NEXT YEAR. SEEING IS BELIEVING WHEN IT COMES TO BITCOIN. THE OTHER TOP STORY IS SPOTIFY REDUCING ITS WORKFORCE BY 17%. THAT'S 1500 JOBS, THE BIGGEST CUTS YET THIS YEAR. GIVE US THE DETAILS. WHAT DID SPOTIFY SAY ABOUT THE TIMING AND RATIONALE FOR CUTTING 1500 EMPLOYEES? > > TODAY, SPOTIFY CEO PUT OUT A BLOG POST SORT OF EXPLAINING THE CUTS. HE SAID BASICALLY THESE DECISIONS WERE GOING TO HAVE TO BE MADE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS, AND THAT HE DECIDED TO JUST RIP THE BAND-AID OFF AND CUT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ALL AT ONCE. HE ESSENTIALLY SAID THEY HAVE CUT OPERATING COSTS QUITE A BIT, NOT ENOUGH, AND THAT THEY NEEDED MORE PEOPLE TO GO AND MORE PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON THE CORE MISSION OF THE LINK FOR CREATORS AND CONSUMERS. CAROLINE: REALIGNING THE FACT THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE ULTIMATELY BUILDING THINGS THAT WEREN'T CORE TO THE MISSION OF BUILDING PROFITABILITY, BUILDING MARGIN. IT'S INTERESTING THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE VOID BY WHAT HAPPENS, SOME REALLY OUTSIZED COMMITMENTS TO THE WORLD OF PODCASTING IN PARTICULAR. > > THE STORY OF SPOTIFY REALLY IS THAT SINCE 2019 THEY'VE COMMITTED OVER BILLION TO THE PODCAST WORLD. THEY BOUGHT STUDIOS, CREATION TECHNOLOGY, A HOSTING SERVICE, AND REALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST YEAR IS JUST A TOTAL BACKTRACK. I IMAGINE AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT TODAY'S CUTS WE WILL HEAR HOW THAT IMPACTS THE PODCAST IS AS IT IS. CAROLINE: ED: LOADS OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS. THE OTHER METRIC IS ACTUALLY, SPOTIFY IS ON TRACK FOR AN ASTONISHINGLY GOOD YEAR, 100 MILLION NEW SUBSCRIBERS OR USERS IS GOING TO ADD BASED ON HOW IT HAS DONE SO FAR. ONE OF THE OVERALL HEALTH SCORE FOR SPOTIFY BASED ON YOUR REPORTING? > > THAT WAS VERY PUZZLING HERE, THEY HAD AMAZING GROWTH FROM A MONTHLY AVERAGE USER PERSPECTIVE. THEY DO HAVE MORE FREE USERS THAN SUBSCRIPTION, SO THAT IS AN ISSUE. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO MONETIZE THOSE SUBSCRIPTIONS MORE. BROADLY SPEAKING THEY CONTINUE TO GROW WHICH IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE. THEY JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE WAY THAT THEY MAKE MORE MONEY. THEY KEEP HAVING TO PAY THESE MUSIC RIGHTS HOLDERS, BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO FIND OTHER REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES. WE SEE PRICE INCREASES, CUT COSTS. WE'VE SEEN THEM MOVING TO PODCASTING AND THEN MOVING TO AUDIOBOOKS. I DON'T KNOW. CAROLINE: AND ALL OF THIS AT A TIME WHERE WE DO SPEAK ABOUT THE MACRO REALITIES AS WELL. HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT MONEY IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT USED TO BE. THIS IS PERHAPS JUST INSTEAD OF THESE MICRO-CUTS THAT ARE HAPPENING, HE IS JUST RIPPING THE BAND-AID AND SHOVING HIS INTENT TO STILL HAVE THIS YEAR OF EFFICIENCY, TO COIN A PHRASE. > > I DON'T KNOW IF WE NOTED IT AT THE TOP BUT THIS IS THE THIRD ROUND OF CUTS THIS YEAR. THEY DID A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK IN JANUARY, ANOTHER IN JUNE WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ON THE PODCAST TEAM. NOW HERE WE ARE WITH THE BIGGEST CUT THAT THEY'VE MADE ALL YEAR. OVERALL, OVER 2000 EMPLOYEES BLOOD LOST THEIR JOBS. > > I AM ON THE PREMIUM FAMILY MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION WHICH I PAY AND I HAVE SOME OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHICH DO NOT PAY, BUT I GUESS IT HAS BECOME A BUSY NIGHT, EARLY MORNING FOR YOU. THERE ARE MORE LAYOFFS AND OTHER STORIES HAPPENING ELSEWHERE. THE THIRD MAJOR HEADCOUNT REDUCTION IN ORDER TO REACH PROFITABLE GROWTH. THE CUTS MOSTLY AFFECTED SALESPEOPLE FOR THE CONSUMER DATA PLATFORM AND CONTACT CENTER SOFTWARE ACCORDING TO A MEMO FROM THE CEO. THE COMPANY HAS SHED MORE THAN 3000 WORKERS SINCE SEPTEMBER 2022, WHICH IS ABOUT ONE THIRD OF ITS TOTAL WORKFORCE IN THAT TIME. CAROLINE: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DISCUSSED. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SILVER LINING CONTINUES TO BE AI AND A $7 MILLION VALUATION. WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'VE MANAGED TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT TECH. \u266a CAROLINE: A CLOUD COMPUTING PROVIDER IS ONE OF THE STOP -- HOTTEST STARTUPS IN THE AI RACE. OTHERS INCLUDING JP MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ALL PARTICIPATING THAT VALUES A COMPANY AT $7 BILLION ACCORDING TO SOURCES. SHE CAN GET A SOURCE VERY CLOSE TO THE DEAL NOW, NONE OTHER THAN THEIR CEO. IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF CORE WE'VE GOING FROM ITS ORIGINS OF COMMODITIES TREATIES TO THE SPACE FOR CRYPTO. THEN YOU BECOME A SPECIALIZED CLOUD AI PROVIDER. WHAT MAKES YOUR OFFERING DIFFERENT FROM THE MORE GENERAL-PURPOSE LAB PROVIDERS OUT THERE? > > SHARE. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GREAT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY EXCITING DAY OVER HERE. MY OWN TEAM IS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THESE TRANSACTIONS AS WE GOING TO THE END OF THE YEAR. LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OFF THE NEXT YEAR IN THE SAME FOOTING. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS WE NEED EVERY DECISION FROM THE HARDWARE STACK ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SOFTWARE STACK TO REALLY BUILD THE CLOUD THAT IS SPECIALIZED TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE COMPANIES WITH MASSIVE SCALE. WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE THREE INDUSTRIES THAT WE ADDRESS. THE FIRST ONE IS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. IF YOU GO SEE A MARBLE MOVIE, THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT SEVERAL OF THE STUDIOS WILL HAVE RENDERED THEIR IMAGE. BASIC SCIENCE, SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY. THINK ABOUT IS DRUG DISCOVERY AND PROTEIN FORM. AND FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY RIGHT NOW, OBVIOUSLY IS THE BUILDOUT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS VERY, VERY APPROPRIATE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING. ED: I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE SORT OF BOOMING GROWTH THAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED. I THINK YOU STARTED THE YEAR DISCLOSING YOU HAD THREE DATA CENTERS ONLINE. NOW I BELIEVE IT OR SOMEWHERE NEAR 14 AND 18. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO MOVE SO QUICKLY ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE? > > GREAT TEAMS ALL ACROSS THE INFRASTRUCTURE. JUST INCREDIBLE COORDINATION, AUTOMATION TO ALLOW US TO KIND OF BUILD AND SCALE THAT. WE ALSO HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS OF THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHAINS THAT HAVE BEEN SO DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE TO NAVIGATE. SUPPORT FROM THEIR PARTNERS ALTER THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. WE'VE MADE A MASSIVE PUSH IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF DATA CENTERS THAT WE ARE IN. IT PUTS US IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE LARGEST, MOST IMPORTANT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELS THAT ARE BEING SERVED TO THE PUBLIC RIGHT NOW. IT'S VERY EXCITING. GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO DO, BUT DEFINITELY IMPROVING AND INCREASING OUR FOOTPRINT EVERY DAY. ED: ONE OF THOSE PARTNERS IS NVIDIA. SHOWING SOME OF YOUR KEY CUSTOMERS ON THE SCREEN. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY HELPING THEM, YOU YOURSELVES TO BUILD THEIR OWN NEXT-GENERATION SUPERCOMPUTER. WHAT DO YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT PROJECT? > > NVIDIA IS A WONDERFUL PARTNER OF OURS. THEY INVESTED ALONGSIDE MAGNA TAR AND K2 IN OUR B ROUND WHICH IS WHERE WE RAISED $420 MILLION IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. IT WAS A MASSIVE STEP FOR US AS WE BEGIN TO ACCELERATE OUR GROWTH THROUGH THE YEAR, AND SO BY HAVING A PARTNER LIKE NVIDIA INVEST IN THE COMPANY, IT MADE VERY CLEAR TO ALL THE PARTNERS ACROSS THE DEBT SPACE, ACROSS THE EQUITY SPACE THAT THEY HAD LOOKED AT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WERE COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THAT WE BUILT IT IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE MOST PERFORMING CONFIGURATION OF THE ACCELERATED COMPUTING DEFINED BY THEIR GP. CAROLINE: YOU'VE BEEN RAISING MONEY, WHETHER IT BE EQUITY OR DEBT A QUITE A PACE BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING NEEDS A LOT OF MONEY. WHEN YOU TAP THE PUBLIC MARKETS, YOU THINK ABOUT GOING PUBLIC AS SOON AS 2024? > > AS YOU SAID, WE REALLY NEED THREE DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS THIS YEAR. WE DID AROUND EARLY ON THAT WAS 21 MILLION RAISE. WE CAME BACK AND WE DID A VERY, VERY LARGE DEBT FACILITY THAT WAS $2.3 MILLION THAT WAS REALLY DEDICATED TO PURCHASING THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED. THE SECONDARY TRANSACTION IS THE FINAL TRANSACTION FOR US OF THE YEAR. WE ARE NOT COMMITTED OR HAVE NO REAL COMMENT AROUND THE CONCEPT OF GOING INTO THE PUBLIC MARKETS OTHER THAN TO SAY WE ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE BUSINESS AND WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO CONTINUE TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE. AS FAR AS THAT GOES, ALL OPTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY ON THE TABLE FOR US AS WE LOOK INTO THE FUTURE. ED: QUICKLY, YOU BUILD ON H 100, BUT AMD IS COMING WITH MI 300. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT? > > WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME RESEARCHING ALL THE DIFFERENT LOOK AND ALTERNATIVES IN THE MARKET. RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS IS ON THE H 100. I WOULD ARGUE THAT AS YOU LOOK ACROSS THE AI SPACE AT LARGE, THE FOCUS IS ON THE H 100. IT IS AN AMAZING PIECE OF SILICON, DOES INCREDIBLE THINGS IN TERMS OF MOVING THE AI SPACE FORWARD. IT HAS REALLY BEEN THE MAJORITY OF OUR EFFORT. WE DO MONITOR ALL OF THE DIFFERENCE LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE OUT THERE. ED: COREWEAVE'S CEO, NICE TO CATCH UP WITH YOU. SELLING MINORITY STAKE AT A BIG VALUATION. COMING UP, LARRY SUMMERS WEIGHS IN ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A MEMBER OF OPENAI'S NEWLY FORMED BOARD. WE ARE GOING TO BRING YOU THOSE DETAILS NEXT. \u266a ED: TIME FOR TALKING TECH, AND FIRST UP, GINA RAIMONDO SAYS IF THE U.S. TRULY WANTS TO STOP CHINA FROM MAKING CUTTING EDGE SEMICONDUCTORS, THAT HER DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO NEED MORE FUNDING. ON SATURDAY, SHE ALSO URGED AMERICAN CHIP COMPANIES TO PRIORITIZE NATIONAL SECURITY OVER THERE REVENUE. IN ONE OF THE CHIPMAKING INDUSTRY'S MOST VALUABLE SUPPLIERS IS SINKING DEEPER INTO DEBT DESPITE HOLDING MORE THAN 90% SHARE. THE CHEMICAL BASED IN JAPAN HAS NOT LISTED PRICES BECAUSE OF FEARS IT WOULD SCOURGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH -- SEMICONDUCTORS. PLUS, CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE THE AGENCY HAS DRAFTED A SET OF RULES THAT AIM TO GIVE RESIDENTS MORE AGENCY OVER HOW THEIR PERSONAL DATA IS USED BY AUTOMATED TOOLS. IF ADOPTED, THE PROPOSAL WOULD AFFECT OUR TECH COMPANIES DEVELOP AI, WHICH RELAYS HEAVILY ON DATA AT THE TRAIN ITSELF. BOARD MEMBERS WILL DISCUSS THE DRAFT ON SATURDAY THOUGH ENFORCEMENT ISN'T LIKELY TO START ANYTIME SOON. CAROLINE: STICK ON AI BECAUSE LARRY SUMMERS IS HOPING TO GET SETTLED INTO HIS NEW ROLE AS A BOARD MEMBER OF THE SO-CALLED INTERIM BOARD OF OPENAI. OF COURSE, THE KEY STARTUP. HE SHARED HIS THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ON WALL STREET WEEK WITH DAVID WESTIN. TAKE A LISTEN. > > THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. NO ONE CAN BE CERTAIN WHETHER THIS WAS ONCE A DECADE, ONCE A HALF-CENTURY, ONCE A CENTURY OR ONCE A MILLENNIUM. NO ONE COULD KNOW THAT FOR SURE. BUT IT SURE LOOKS LIKE IT IS AWFULLY IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP RAPIDLY AND SAFELY AND TO DISSEMINATE EFFECTIVELY AND WELL. SO WHEN I WAS OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF CONTRIBUTING TO THAT OVERSEEING TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS EFFECTIVELY DONE AND TO DO WOODWORKING WITH SOME VERY GREAT PEOPLE, I THOUGHT IT WAS A REAL OPPORTUNITY AND I WAS GLAD TO DO IT. > > I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM YOUR TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE FOR WHAT YOU JUST SAID SAFELY STRIKES ME AS PART OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON AND THAT GETS TO QUESTIONS OF GOVERNANCE, ABOUT HOW YOU HANDLE THIS TECHNOLOGY. DO YOU HAVE AN OVERALL SENSE OF WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET THAT \"SAFELY\" PART RIGHT? > > THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME THE ONBOARDING PACKET FOR THE BOARD ON SUNDAY. SO I SHOULDN'T BE SAYING TOO MUCH AT ALL BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH. HERE'S SOME THINGS I THINK I KNOW. I THINK I KNOW THAT A COMPANY LIKE THIS HAS TO BE PREPARED TO COOPERATE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN ALWAYS AGREEING WITH, BUT COOPERATING WITH KEY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ON REGULATORY ISSUES, ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES, ON DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ISSUES. I THINK I KNOW ALSO, AND THIS IS INTEGRAL TO THE STRUCTURE OF OPENAI, THE ENTITY ITSELF IS A CREATURE OF A NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITY THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE A CORPORATION WITH A CONSCIENCE. AND THAT WE NEED TO BE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AND AS A BOARD MEMBER, THAT WILL BE PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY WORKING WITH OTHER BOARD MEMBERS TO MAKE THAT CERTAIN. MY COLLEAGUE AT HARVARD, LATE COLLEAGUE SAID CONSCIENCE IS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMEONE IS WATCHING. AND I THINK IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THIS TO BE THINKING VERY CAREFULLY ALWAYS ABOUT BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE BALANCED IN THE BEST WAY THAT IS POSSIBLE. ED: THAT WAS FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY LARRY SUMMERS SITTING DOWN WITH DAVID WESTIN. WE SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT LARRY SUMMERS A HARVARD UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND A PAID CONTRIBUTOR TO BLOOMBERG TV AND WALL STREET WEEK. NOW, AS WE KEEP AN EYE ON THE SITUATION WITH THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR, THE SITUATION IS ALSO ONE THAT HAS BEEN HARD TO MANAGE ONLINE. TIKTOK IS HAVING A HARD TIME MODERATING DEEPFAKE VIDEOS OF HAMAS VICTIMS AND OTHER PRIVATE CITIZENS. EVEN THOUGH THESE VIDEOS VIOLATE THEIR CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES WHICH BAN AI-GENERATED VIDEOS, AND YET THESE VIDEOS ARE RACKING UP THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF VIEWS. I WANT TO BRING IN ALEX WHO HAS BEEN WRITING ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING ON BLOOMBERG. THAT IS THE STRUGGLE. THEY ARE IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE POLICY BEING SEEN BY MILLIONS. > > IN THE DAYS AFTER THE OCTOBER 7 ATTACK IN ISRAEL ON THAT MUSIC FESTIVAL, I WAS LOOKING ON THE AVENUE FOR SOME OF THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE BELIEVED VICTIMS AND SOME OF THE TOP VIDEOS WERE AI- GENERATED VIDEOS THAT PURPORTED TO AND SHOWED FOLKS LIKE THE 22-YEAR-OLD NOW KNOWN TO BE DEAD GERMAN-ISRAELI WOMAN WHO YOU SAW HER FACE, YOU SAW AN IMAGE LIKE HER STANDING IN FRONT OF FOLKS IN MILITARY GARB HOLDING GUNS TALKING ABOUT HER THOUGHTS ON THE ATTACK, TALKING ABOUT HER MOTHER, BUT THIS WAS NOT, IN FACT, HER. THIS WAS A DIGITAL RESURRECTION AS EXPERTS CALL IT, WHERE SOMEBODY WENT ONLINE, USED ONE OF THESE INCREASINGLY INEXPENSIVE TOOLS TO TAKE SOME PHOTOS OF HER FROM THE INTERNET AND TURN IT INTO AN AI-GENERATED VIDEO. NOW, THESE VIDEOS ARE AGAINST THE CONTENT GUIDELINES TIKTOK. PRIVATE CITIZENS AND MINORS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE PORTRAYED IN WHAT TIKTOK BECAUSE SYNTHETIC MEDIA WHICH INCLUDES AI-VIDEOS, BUT THAT VIDEO RACKED UP 7 MILLION VIEWS ALONE BEFORE I SEND IT TO TIKTOK AND THEY TOOK IT DOWN. THERE ARE DOZENS OF ADDITIONAL VIDEOS LIKE THIS PORTRAYING BOTH VICTIMS OF HAMAS, TH REE-YOUR-OLD MURDER VICTIMS OF A CHILD'S VOICE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY DIED AND THE INJURIES SUSTAINED AND THESE VIDEOS ARE LIVE AND AGAIN, RACKING UP THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF VIEWS AND SOMETIMES GOING VIRAL. THIS IS JUST AN INDICATOR TO ME AT THIS EARLY WAVE OF WHERE AI IS SITTING REAL PEOPLE AND IN PARTICULAR, PEOPLE WHO CANNOT ACTUALLY DEFEND THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SEE THEIR LIKENESS OUT THERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. CAROLINE: SO DEEPLY EMOTIVE. JUST TO SAY WHAT TIKTOK HAS COME BACK WITH, THEY CONTINUE TO INVEST IN DETECTION AND TRANSPARENCY TO ADDRESS THIS RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY, BUT THEREIN LIES THE ISSUE. IT IS A RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY. DO YOU THINK MORE COULD BE DONE INTERNALLY BY TIKTOK AND INDEED, THE OTHER KEY SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYERS OUT HERE? > > THEY'VE ALREADY ROLLED OUT TOOLS TO ASK USERS TO OPT INTO LABEL AI ON VIDEOS THAT USE AI, BUT MOST OF THESE VIDEOS THAT I CAME ACROSS DIDN'T HAVE THAT LABEL. IT'S CLEAR THEY NEED TO BE DOING MORE BEHIND THE SCENES WITH THEIR INCREDIBLY POWERFUL ALGORITHMS, WITH HUMAN MODERATORS TO BE PICKING UP ON THE STUFF. BUT EXPERTS ARE ALREADY RAISING A FLAG NOT JUST IN THESE RESURRECTIONS, BUT ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO THINGS LIKE THE ELECTION. RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THESE VIDEOS HAVE THIS UNCANNY VALLEY FEELING. THEY ARE GOING TO GET MORE REALISTIC AND THE APPS ARE GOING TO NEED TO DO MORE TO DETECT THEM. ED: WELCOME BACK TO \"BLOOMBERG TECHNOLOGY.\" CAROLINE: AFTER HAVING THE BIGGEST SELLOFF IN MORE THAN A MONTH NOW, WE\u2019RE OFF BY MORE THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. IS IT PROFIT TAKING AFTER THE RUNUP THAT WE\u2019VE HAD THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER? IS IT A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT\u2019S PERHAPS WE\u2019RE BAKING IN TOO MUCH? THE SELLOFF OF STOCKS AND THE SELLOFF OF BONDS AS WELL, THE TWO-YEAR YIELD SPIKING AS WELL. I\u2019M LOOKING AT IN SPITE OF THE SELLOFF IN RISK ASSETS, ONE STANDS OUT. BITCOIN POWERING UP, UP $42,000 AND WE\u2019RE STILL ON THE HIGH SIDE. YOU KNOW THE DRIVING FORCES. WE\u2019RE STILL TALKING ABOUT E.T.F., WILL WE GET, WHAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO COME NEXT YEAR, BUT WHAT WILL MACRO POLICY MEAN FOR BITCOIN INTO 2024? STILL ON THE HIGH SIDE. LET\u2019S LOOK AT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL MOVERS TODAY. UBER, THAT\u2019S WHAT\u2019S DRIVING IT HIGHER, UP 5% ON THE DIE. ACTUALLY YOU WANT ONLY FIELDS OF GREEN. LET\u2019S GO TO SOME OF THE LOSERS. SOME INSIDE SELLING HAPPENING. IN NVIDIA, 370,000 SHARES WERE EITHER SOLD OR FILED TO BE SOLD BY INTERNAL CANDIDATES, OF COURSE, EXECUTIVES AT THEIR COMPANY. SO IT\u2019S OFF BY 2.4% AFTER CAUSING A MASSIVE RUN FOR 2023. META, MARK ZUCKERBERG, FIRST TIME IN YEARS HE\u2019S SELLING HIS OWN SHARES. BUT WE\u2019VE GOT TO SOMETHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT NEXT. ED: AND WE\u2019RE GOING PRIVATE THIS TIME. A NEW AUTONOMOUS AIR VEHICLE, ROAD RUNNER, IS AKIN TO A MINI REUSABLE FIGHTER JET THAT BLOWS UP DRONES, AND THE STARTUPLESS THE U.S. WILL DEPLOY IN THE FIELD NEXT YEAR. WE JUST SHOWED IMAGES OF IT. FROM A TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE, YOU\u2019VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS IN SECRET FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. WHAT IS NEW HERE? WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY AT PLAY? > > ROAD RUNNER IS AN A.I. PILOTED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE. IT\u2019S POWERED BY TWO TWIN TURBO THRUST ENGINES, VERY, VERY FAST. CARRIES A SIGNIFICANT PAY LOAD. IT\u2019S VERY MANEUVERABILITY. BUT THE REALLY COOL THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT CAN BE REUSED. IT\u2019S A VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING VEHICLE. THAT MEANS WITH CERTAIN PAY LOADS, YOU CAN GO OUT THERE, PERFORM THE MISSION, COME BACK, RELAND, AND THEN REFUEL, REARM, AND USE IT AGAIN. WITH OTHER PAY LOADS, LET\u2019S SAY A ONE-WAY WAR HEAD TO GO UP AGAINST A LARGE AIRCRAFT, I CAN SEND A WHOLE SWARM OF ROAD RUNNERS OUT THERE, AND ONLY THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY ENGAGE THE TARGET ARE CONSUMED. EVERYONE ELSE CAN COME HOME. THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE MUCH GREATER EFFECTIVE MAGAZINE DEPTH AND TO USE THESE THINGS IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN\u2019T USE TRADITIONAL ONE-WAY MISSILES. ONCE YOU LAUNCH IT, IT\u2019S GONE. WHETHER YOU LAUNCH A BUNCH OF THEM OR ONE OF THEM. ED: WE SHARE WITH OUR AUDIENCE A STORY THAT THE U.S. PLANS TO PUT THIS TO DEPLOYMENT NEXT YEAR. SO MUCH OF THE NEWS FLOW AROUND DRONES HAS BEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE. DRONES ARE A KEY STRATEGY FOR BOTH SIDES IT SEEMS. DO YOU SEE ROAD RUNNER BEING DEPLOYED IN UKRAINE IN THE NEAR TERM? WHAT KIND OF TALKS HAVE YOU HAD AROUND THAT? > > I SEE IT IN MY MIND\u2019S EYE. BUT WHETHER IT GOES THERE ISN\u2019T UP TO MITCHELL IT\u2019S UP TO A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE PROCESS IS GOVERNMENT-DRIVEN RATHER THAN COMPANY-DRIVEN, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME. WE\u2019VE BEEN IN UKRAINE SINCE THE SECOND WORK OF THE WAR, NOT JUST WITH OUR PRODUCTS, BUT SENDING PEOPLE OVER THERE. I WAS IN KYIV TO MEET WITH ZELENSKYY FOR THE SECOND TIME. I MET WITH HIM AHEAD OF THE WAR BECAUSE HE WAS INTERESTED IN PURCHASING SOME OF OUR SECURITY. UNFORTUNATELY THAT WASN\u2019T SOMETHING WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE RESTRICTIONS I MENTIONED EARLIER. IT\u2019S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE PERSONALLY. CAROLINE: WHAT ABOUT DEMAND FROM EUROPE? > > I MEAN, WE HAVE A LOT OF EUROPEAN CUSTOMERS. WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN PARTICULAR WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM AND U.K. ROYAL MARINES ESPECIALLY. BUT THERE\u2019S A LITTLE BIT OF A TRICKY DYNAMIC WITH SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES REALLY SEE THEIR DEFENSE APPARATUS AS A WAY TO RUN A JOBS PROGRAM, AND THEY ARE FORCING US, COMPANIES LIKE ANDURIL, TO COMPETE WITH THEIR OWN DOMESTIC CAPABILITIES. IT MIGHT BE YEARS HINTED OR MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT IT\u2019S HARD FOR THEM TO GET OVER THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD BE DROPPING THAT INTERNAL PROGRAM TO BUY SOMETHING FROM AN AMERICAN COMPANY. IT\u2019S A DIFFICULT PILL TO SWALLOW FOR SOME OF THE COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY ONES THAT DO HAVE WHAT ANYONE WOULD CONSIDER A PRETTY STRONG DEFENSE INDUSTRY OF THEIR OWN. CAROLINE: ONE COUNTRY THAT HAS A STRONG DEFENSE INDUSTRY OF THEIR OWN IS CHINA. YOU\u2019VE BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON THIS. WE\u2019VE HEARD NOT ONLY ABOUT CHINA\u2019S STRENGTH IN DEFENSE, BUT ALSO THEIR STRENGTH IN A.I. I\u2019M INTERESTED AS TO HOW MUCH THOSE CONVERSATIONS SURROUNDING TAIWAN, THE CONCERNS THERE, ARE BUILDING AND WHETHER OR NOT IT\u2019S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE D.O.D. ABOUT. > > IT\u2019S ALL ABOUT THAT. EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE CAPABILITIES THAT WE\u2019RE BUILDING TODAY ARE READY TO GO FOR A FIGHT IN THE PACIFIC IN 2027 OR EARLIER. BECAUSE THAT IS THE LATEST THAT WE SEE CHINA TRYING TO LAUNCH AN OFFENSIVE, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, THAT\u2019S THE TIMING FOR SOME KIND OF ACTION AGAINST TAIWAN, WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY. THERE\u2019S A LOT OF PLACES AROUND THE WORLD WE CALL PARTNERS. THERE\u2019S A LOT OF PLACES WE SAY ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR INTERESTS. TAIWAN AND THEIR SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS AS IMPORTANT AS IT GETS, ESPECIALLY FOR SUCH A SMALL COUNTRY, SO CLOSE TO CHINA. THE GOOD NEWS IS PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING THIS THREAT. BIG TECH COMPANIES YEARS AGO THOUGHT THAT CHINA WAS SOMEONE THAT WAS GOING TO BE A HUGE GROWTH MARKET FOR THEM. THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO GET IN AND SELL THEM SOCIAL MEDIA, SELL THEM SERVICES. I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO REALIZE THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING. THEY\u2019RE COMING HERE AND EATING OUR LUNCH. THAT IS, I THINK, POSITIVE FOR TECH COMPANIES\u2019 DECISIONS TO START WORKING WITH THE D.O.D. AGAIN. ED: THERE\u2019S AN INTENSE INTEREST IN ANDURIL. PEOPLE DON\u2019T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THE COMPANY F. WE TAKE THE KIND OF TAIWAN CASE STUDY, ROAD RUNNER ASIDE, WHAT ARE THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU CAN OFFER THAT YOU WOULD DEPLOY IN A HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO LIKE THAT? > > OUR CORE PRODUCT IS SOMETHING CALLED LATTICE A.I. IT POWERS ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING ON SOFTWARE THAN HARDWARE, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE OVER A DOZEN HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THAT\u2019S BECAUSE LATTICE IS SOMETHING, OUR SOFTWARE INVESTMENT IS SOMETHING WE CAN REACH ACROSS ALL THESE SYSTEMS. LATTICE A.I. IS INTEGRATED WITH MORE THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS THAN ANDURIL-MADE PRODUCTS. WE MAKE UNDERWATER VEHICLES LIKE THE DIVE SUBMARINE. WE MAKE ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS, SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, TACTICAL SYSTEMS LIKE THE GHOST HELICOPTER DRONE. WE\u2019VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD MAKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE. AGAIN, EVERYTHING THAT WE\u2019RE DOING, AND MOST OF WHAT THE D.O.D. IS DOING IS PREPARING FOR A CONFLICT WITH A GREAT POWER LIKE CHINA IN THE PACIFIC ON A NEAR-TERM TIME FRAME. ANYTHING THAT WE MAKE TALLAHASSEE NOT GOING TO BE READY TO GO INTO THAT TYPE OF FIGHT, WHETHER LITTLE A BLOCKADE OR A REAL INVASION IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT OR WORTH HEAVY INVESTMENT. ED: WHEN I POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA YOU WERE COMING ON THE SHOW, THE MOST COMMON QUESTION WAS ABOUT MANUFACTURING. IF YOU TAKE ROAD RUNNER AS AN EXAMPLE, THEY KNOW IT\u2019S A CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY. BUT THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU SCALE THE OUTPUT THAT HAVE PRODUCT. > > THERE\u2019S A FEW THINGS THAT GO INTO THAT. ANDURIL IS A DEFENSE PRODUCT COMPANY. WE USE OUR OWN MONEY TO DECIDE WHAT TO BUILD, HOW TO BUILD IT, AND THEN WE BUILD IT AND SELL IT WHEN IT\u2019S DONE. THAT\u2019S DIFFERENT THAN COMPANIES THAT GET PAID MORE WHEN THEY HAVE, LET\u2019S SAY, AN INEFFICIENT MANUFACTURING PROCESS OR LONGER MANUFACTURING PROCESS. BECAUSE THEY\u2019RE ON A COST PLUS CONTRACT. AND OUR HEAD OF MANUFACTURING COMES FROM TESLA, WHERE HE SCALED SEVERAL LINES TO VERY, VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF VEHICLES. WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE MAKING CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ON A VERY TIGHT SCHEDULE. WE\u2019VE DONE FIVE NEW REVISIONS OF CENTURY TOWER, FOUR NEW REVISIONS OF OUR GHOST DRONE IN JUST FIVE OR SIX YEARS. SO WE\u2019RE ON MORE OF A CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING AND ITERATION CYCLE THAN ANY COMPANY WOULD BE. MY PREVIOUS COMPANY WAS OCULUS V.R. I STARTED THAT WHEN I WAS 19 YEARS OLD, SOLD IT TO FOOTBALL FOR A FEW BILLION DOLLARS. WAS THERE FOR A FEW YEARS BEFORE GETTING FIRED. WHILE I WAS THERE, WE MADE MILLION OF VIRTUALLY REALITY HEAD SETS IN CHINA. I KNOW HOW CHINA DOES THINGS. I KNOW HOW THESE THINGS CAN BE DONE. I\u2019M TRYING TO BRING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT CHINESE ENERGY HERE TO U.S. MANUFACTURING, ABSENT ALL THE STUFF THAT I HATE ABOUT CHINA. CAROLINE: JUST TO PUT PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT YOU CAN LEARN, PERHAPS YOU DISLIKE PARTS OF WHAT\u2019S EVIDENT. TO THAT POINT, EVERYONE IS CURRENTLY HAND WRINGING ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, U.S. VERSUS CHINA, CHINA VERSUS EVERYONE. YOU WERE JUST IN THE U.K. SAYING YOU\u2019VE BEEN BUILDING RELATIONSHIP THERE. WE THINK ABOUT THE U.K. A.I. SUMMIT. 31 COUNTRIES SIGNED UP TO SOME SORT OF GUARD RAILS WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACCELERATION OF DEPLOYMENT OF A.I. IN THE MILITARY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE MOVES TO PUTTING GUARD RAILS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IF USED WITHIN MILITARY? > > A LOT OF THESE ARE DECADES BEHIND. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR DECADES. IT BOTHERS ME WHEN PEOPLE SAY WE NEED TO COME ONE RULES THAT TELL THE D.O.D. WHAT TO DO. THEY HAVEN\u2019T BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS. THEY DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS ARE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DEPLOYING AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS LIKE RADAR-SEEKING MISSILES FOR DECADES NOW. LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE A C-RAM, THE AUTOMATED GUNS PROTECTING OUR BASES AND SHIPS FROM INCOMING MORTAR FIRE, INCOMING MISSILE AND ROCKET FIRE. THOSE ARE AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS. THEY\u2019RE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO SHOOT DOWN AND WHAT TO NOT WITHOUT A PERSON MANUALLY DECIDING WHAT TO DO BEYOND DECIDING TO TURN ON THE SYSTEM AND ALOCAL LOU IT TO ENGAGE TARGETS PERIOD. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS VERY STRONG DOCTRINE AROUND THIS THAT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO MAKING SURE A HUMAN IS ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DECISION. THAT DOESN\u2019T MEAN THAT THE PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PULLING THE TRIGGER. I HATE THIS IDEA, PEOPLE SAY CAN\u2019T AGREE THAT AN A.I. SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHEN TO PULL THE TRIGGER. I DON\u2019T AGREE WITH THAT, BECAUSE I DON\u2019T THINK THERE\u2019S ANY MORAL HIGH GROUND IN MAKING A LANDMINE THAT CAN\u2019T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SCHOOL BUS FULL OF CHILDREN AND A RUSSIAN TANK COLUMN. I THINK IT IS GOOD FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHEN TO PULL THE TRIGGER, AS LONG AS A PERSON IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT DEPLOYMENT AND WHATEVER GOES WRONG IN THE END. I\u2019D SAY A LOT IS PERFORM AACTIVE. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT A.I. OR WEAPONS UNTIL VERY RECENTLY. THEY\u2019RE NOW DECLARING THEMSELVES TO BE A.I. SAFETY EXPERTS. THEY ARE DECADES BEHIND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON AUTONOMOUS POLICY AND WEAPONS AND GUIDELINES. I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS CLEARLY FAR AND AWAY THE LEADER IN THIS SPACE. ED: I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT, WHEN I PUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA YOU WERE COMING ON THE SHOW, THERE WERE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT DON\u2019T AGREE WITH THE USE OF ANY TECHNOLOGY IN THE CONTEXT OF WAR. BECAUSE THEY DON\u2019T WANT ANY CONSIDERATION OF WAR. THEY BELIEVE IN PEACE, FRANKLY. IT WOULD BE REMISS OF ME NOT TO ASK YOU AS WELL ABOUT OCULUS. YOU MENTIONED IT. I THINK WE\u2019RE ALMOST AT THE 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THEN FACEBOOK ACQUIRING YOUR COMPANY, OCULUS. OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, WHERE HAVE WE LANDED IN V.R. AND A.R.? THIS YEAR WE HAD MET AQUEST AND VISION FROM APPLE. GIVE ME YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD FOR HEAD SETS. > > THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT WE SHOULDN\u2019T BE USING TECH IN ANY OF THE STUFF, I\u2019D SAY LET\u2019S ARM NATO WITH STICKS AND STONES AND SEE HOW IT GOES. V.R., I\u2019M REALLY EXCITED WITH HOW IT\u2019S GOING. I AM HAPPY TO SEE A LOT OF MY DEEPLY HELD TECHNICAL BELIEFS PLAYING OUT IN THE MARKET. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE APPLE VISION PRO BEING KIND OF AN AUGMENT THE REALITY, MIXED REALITY COMBO HEAD SET THAT IS DOING A FULL PROJECTION OF THE WORLD. IT IS USING ALL NEW PPHOTONS TO PROJECT IN YOUR EYES. I\u2019VE ALWAYS BEEN ON THE HARD A.R. FULL SIDE. HAPPY TO SEE THAT KIND OF PANNING OUT WITH APPLE. I\u2019VE USE WANTED THE NEW APPLE HEAD SET. IT\u2019S AMAZING. PROBABLY THE BEST ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT I\u2019VE DONE ON THE V.R. SIDE WAS MAKING SURE THAT V.R. CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD AND IS NOW SOMETHING THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON. FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I\u2019M GOING BUY REALLY NICE HEAD SETS WITHOUT HAVING TO DO IT MYSELF, WHICH IS WHAT I WAS DOING WHEN I WAS 15 AND 16 STARTING OCULUS. ED: GOOD TO CATCH YOU. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US HERE ON BLOOMBERG TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. COMING UP ON THE SHOW, THE CRYPTO RALLY GATHERED STEAM AS BITCOIN TOPS $42,000 U.S. WE\u2019RE GOING TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING AND DISCUSS INVESTING IN THE DIGITAL CURRENCY ECOSYSTEM MORE BROADLY. THAT\u2019S THE SPOTLIGHT NEXT. CAROLINE: BITCOIN, IF YOU HADN\u2019T NOTICED, HAS SURGED PAST $42,000 AGAIN, EXTENDING THE RALLY TO MORE THAN 150% SO FAR THIS YEAR. FAR OUTPACING STOCKS AND OTHER RISK ASSETS. WE\u2019RE GOING TO BE INVESTING AND LOOKING AT THE RETURN OF DIGITAL CURRENCY ECOSYSTEM AND THE STARTUPS WITHIN IT. MORGAN IS WITH US. YOU INVEST IN A WHOLE BROAD REMITT OF COMPANIES. WHAT WE LOVE IS YOUR BACKGROUND AND THE FACT YOU WERE THERE BUILDING ONE OF THE FIRST STABLE COINS. YOU INVEST IN COMPANIES SUCH AS RAMP, WHICH IS ABOUT FEAR AND CRYPTO. THIS EXUBERANCE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT INSTITUTIONAL ACCESS, WHETHER OR NOT WE GET A BITCOIN E.T.F. WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT REALLY WORKS FOR THE ECOSYSTEM AT LARGE? > > THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME. SEEING THIS TURN IS EXCITING, ALTHOUGH I\u2019M CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. I THINK THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL, LIKE SCHROEDER\u2019S CATS, IS IT DEAD, IS IT ALIVE? AND I THINK WE\u2019RE TURNING A CORNER, KNOCK ON ALL THE WOOD THAT IT MIGHT FINALLY ACTUALLY BE HAPPENING, WHICH WOULD BE HUGE, IF NOT THE LARGEST IMPACT THAT COULD BE HAD ON INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION. AND THE SECOND CAT WAS FINANCE. PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT BINANCE, WHAT WAS AND WASN\u2019T GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT I THINK WE SAW HAPPEN A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE SPACE. I THINK THOSE ARE TWO HUGE UNKNOWNS THAT I THINK ARE NOW BECOMING KNOWN IN A POSITIVE WAY. SO THAT\u2019S EXCITING FOR THE SPACE. ED: CAROLINE AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WHEN BITCOIN GOES UP, PUBLICLY TRADELY, CRYPTO-RELATED STOCKS ALSO GO UP, EITHER BECAUSE IT\u2019S A PROXY FOR EXPOSURE IF YOU\u2019RE NOT INVESTED IN A DIGITAL CURRENCY. OR IT\u2019S A LOGIC IF BITCOIN IS DOING WELL, THAT\u2019S THE THING THAT UNDERPINS ALL OF THOSE COMPANIES SO THEY DO WELL AS WELL. SPIN THAT FORWARD TO THE V.C. CONTEXT. IS BITCOIN BEING UP GOOD FOR YOU WHEN YOU DECIDE TO INVEST HERE, HERE OR THERE? > > I LIKE THAT I STAY SOBER ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN\u2019T MATTER, BUT IN REALITY IT PROBABLY DOES AFFECT MINE AND OTHERS\u2019 PSYCHES. I THINK I\u2019VE SAID IT BEFORE, BUT FOR ME THERE\u2019S ALWAYS THREE QUESTIONS, WHICH IS ONE, IS IT COMPANY SOLVING A PROBLEM FOR ANYONE? TWO, IS ANYONE USING THIS THING? AND THREE, IS THIS PRODUCT OR COMPANY MAKING MONEY OR HAS ANY POTENTIAL TO MAKE MONEY? AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF CRYPTO AND CRYPTO STARTUPS, THERE\u2019S VERY FEW THAT ACTUALLY CHECK ALL THREE OF THOSE BOXES, LET ALONE ONE OR TWO. AND BITCOIN IS ONE OF THE FEW CASES THAT CHECKS ALL THE BOXES AND IS REAL. IT\u2019S DEFINITELY A CASE STUDY FOR POTENTIALLY OTHER INVESTMENTS. BUT AT THE OTHER STAGE, I TRY TO NOT LOOK AT THE PRICE OF BITCOIN. CAROLINE: WHAT YOU LOOK AT IS PROBABLY THE GENERAL ENERGY OF BUILDING IN THE SEED STAGE RIGHT NOW. TO THAT END, AMID WHAT HAS BEEN TERMED YET ANOTHER CRYPTO WINTER, HAS THE BUILDING STILL BEEN GOING? ARE THERE PROBLEMS BEING SOLVED WHEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT PRICES AND ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT FUNDAMENTALLY IS BEING BUILT? > > BUILDING IS STILL GOING. WHEN THE MARKET WAS NUTS, YOU HAD WHAT MY PARTNER JAMES CALLED THE FRUIT FLIES COMING IN, SO THE FOUNDERS WHO THOUGHT IT WAS JUST LIKE THE SEXIEST ACCESSORY TO HAVE A CRYPTO COMPANY AND THOUGHT OVERNIGHT THEY WOULD BE WORTH A LOT ON PAPER. AND WHAT THE MARKET COOLING DOWN, IS FILTERED THE FOUNDERS OUT. NOW YOU ONLY HAVE FOUNDERS COMING IN WHO ACTUALLY HAVE A PROBLEM TO SOLVE. IN A WEIRD WAY, THE BEAR MARKET IS VERY NICE, BECAUSE IT AUTOMATICALLY APPLIES A FILTER, AT LEAST TO THE TOP OF THE FUNNEL STARTUPS. THAT ISN\u2019T NECESSARILY THERE IN A BULL MARKET. ED: MORGAN, BIGGER PICTURE, WE\u2019VE HAD A LOT OF GUESTS ON THE SHOW THAT CRITICIZE THE U.S. AS A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, OR A MARKET ENVIRONMENT TO FOSTER THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY, LET\u2019S SAY BLOCK CHAIN IN THIS INSTANCE. YOUR VIEW ON THAT? > > I AM PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN. HOWEVER, I DO WISH THAT CRYPTO REGULATION WAS A BIT MORE FOUNDER-FRIENDLY THAN IT CURRENTLY IS. TO BRING BACK ANY SLOWED SHROEDINGER\u2019S CAT THEORY, THERE\u2019S A LOT OF WAYS VARIOUS BODIES CAN GO ON VARIOUS TOPICS. IN CRYPTO, IT\u2019S SCARING FOUNDERS AWAY FROM STARTING COMPANIES IN THE U.S. IF THERE WAS MORE CLARITY IN ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER, THAT WOULD LIMIT OF AMOUNT OF GUESSING OR FEAR THAT WAS REQUIRED TO START A COMPANY, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A LOT MORE CONDUCIVE TO FOUNDERS, SPECIFICALLY STARTING COMPANIES IN THIS SPACE IN THE UNITED STATES. ED: MORGAN BELLER, WE ALWAYS ENJOY HAVING YOU ON THE CAT. THE CAT ANALOGY, LET\u2019S SEE IF IT GETS TRACTION, WE\u2019LL SEE. > > I\u2019M A DOG PERSON, BY THE WAY. ED: AS YOU KNOW, I MET YOUR DOG, WHICH IS ALWAYS AT YOUR SIDE. BUT WE\u2019RE OUT OF TIME TODAY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. COMING UP, APPLE PREPARES TO CUT TIES WITH GOLDMAN SACHS, AND WHO WILL REPLACE THE BANK TO PARTNER WITH APPLE ON THE CARD? WE\u2019RE GOING TO DISCUSS THAT NEXT. ED: APPLE\u2019S LONG-ANTICIPATED BREAKUP WITH ITS MAIN FINANCIAL SERVICES PARTNER, GOLDMAN SACHS, IS UNDERWAY WITH THE IPHONE MAKER OFFERING THE BANK AN OUT. WHO MIGHT REPLACE GOLDMAN IS THE FOCUS OF THIS YEAR\u2019S POWER CALL, AND YOU HAVE A THESIS, CHASE. > > YEAH, FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. WE HEARD ABOUT CITI BANK, WE HEARD ABOUT AMERICAN EXPRESS. BUT I THINK CHASE IS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST LIKELY COMPANY TO TAKE OVER FOR GOLDMAN SACHS IN TERMS OF THE APPLE CARD PARTNERSHIP. CHASE HAS A LOT GOING FOR IT. IT MAKES A TON OF MONEY T. HAS THE CASH BALANCE. IT HAS THE MANAGEMENT. IT HAS THE RESERVES TO TAKE ON A PARTNERSHIP THAT MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY LUCRATIVE AT THE GET-GO. IT DOES HAVE TIME TO SORT OF BAKE INTO ITS FINANCIALS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG-TERM STRATEGY AND PARTNERSHIP. GOLDMAN LOST A COUPLE OF BILLION DOLLARS, MAYBE MORE ON THIS. THEY COULDN\u2019T SUSTAIN IT. CHASE PROBABLY COULD. APPLE AND CHASE, MOST PEOPLE DON\u2019T KNOW, HAVE A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP. CHASE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PARTNERS FOR CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS IN THE APP STORE. APPLE ONLINE SERVICES, APPLE\u2019S RETAIL STORES, ONLINE STORES. APPLE PROBABLY GETS A BETTER RATE BECAUSE OF THE DEAL WITH CHASE AND HOW MUCH CREDIT CARD USAGE THERE IS. AND THERE\u2019S ALL SORTS OF STUFF BEHIND THE SCENES, STORING THEIR CASH BALANCE. THAT LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEY\u2019RE PRIMED FOR A BIGGER EXPANSION. CAROLINE: GREAT WRITE-UP. I URGE PEOPLE TO GO. ALSO LEARNED THAT THESE STORIES ARE PLAYING GOLF SOMETIMES. MARK ALWAYS WITH THE FACTS, THANK YOU. MEANWHILE, THAT DOES IT FOR"

        "content": "The price of gold has broken through a new all-time high, surpassing the significant level of $2,100 during the Asian session on Monday, Dec. 4. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has also surged above $41,000 for the first time in 19 months.\n\nBTC/USD (blue) vs. gold price (orange) Source: Tradingview\n\nBitcoin price breaks $40K...and $41K\n\nBitcoin has made a triumphant return to the $40,000 threshold, a figure unseen since the heights of April 2022. This included a swift 2% jump over 24 hours, marking a 19-month peak for the cryptocurrency.\n\nWild tailwinds for bitcoin:\n\n\u2705 New ATH in gold\n\n\u2705 to abolish central bank\n\n\u2705 Worst bond crash in 250yrs\n\n\u2705 BTC ETF on the cusp (?)\n\n\u2705 Real estate trembling\n\n\u2705 Consumer Tech languishing\n\n\u2705 Banks shaking\n\n\u2705 Fed getting ready to pump\n\n\u2705 Halving in April\n\n\u2705 Bitcoin L2 is here \u2014 Tuur Demeester (@TuurDemeester) December 4, 2023\n\nWhat's more, Bitcoin has now risen over 140% since the beginning of the year.\n\nInsights from Matrixport\u2019s research head, Markus Thielen, suggest an even brighter future. With historical trends of post-bear market bull cycles and upcoming Bitcoin halving events as a backdrop, projections place Bitcoin at over $60,000 by April next year and as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nRelated: BTC price models hint at $130K target after 2024 Bitcoin halving\n\nSuch predictions rest on the historic pattern of price increases preceding halving events, with an expected surge of over 200%.\n\n\"On the eve of a spot Bitcoin ETF\"\n\nThe speculative winds are further fanned by the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nWith 13 bidders, including industry giants like BlackRock and Grayscale, the anticipation is building toward a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBloomberg\u2019s ETF analysts see a high probability of simultaneous approvals for all pending bids by Jan. 10, which would mark not only a new era of institutional participation and investment in Bitcoin, but likely a boost for BTC price as well.\n\n\u201cIt's very likely we are on the eve of a Bitcoin spot ETF,\u201d commented Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo on X about the new highs in gold price. \u201cThe first commodity ETF was SPDR Gold Trust. It provided a simple way for investors to access gold in their portfolio.\u201d\n\nWoo added:\n\n\u201cWhen it launched, gold went on to an 8-year rally with no single down year between 2005 - 2012.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Bitcoin's latest move above the psychological $40,000 level reflects bullish market sentiment fueled by the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in January and the prospect of regulatory advancements in general. Bitcoin's halving event, meanwhile, is only expected to provide additional tailwinds for BTC price over the next five months.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin price hit 2023 high, so why are retail traders waiting on the sidelines? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market surged past $1.55 trillion on Dec. 5, driven by remarkable weekly gains of 14.5% for Bitcoin (BTC) and 11% for Ether (ETH). Notably, this milestone, marking the highest level in 19 months, propelled Bitcoin to become the world\u2019s ninth-largest tradable asset, surpassing Meta\u2019s $814 billion capitalization.\n\nDespite the recent bullish momentum, analysts have observed that retail demand remains relatively stagnant. Some attribute this to the ripple effects of an inflationary environment and decreased interest in credit, given that interest rates continue to hover above 5.25%. While analyst Rajat Soni\u2019s post may have dramatized the situation, the underlying, in essence, holds true.\n\nRetail investors aren't paying attention to #bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThey are more worried about whether or not they will be able to pay rent or put food on the table.\n\n\n\nThey will likely start paying attention near the next top (IMO sometime in 2025) and they will FOMO into a position before\u2026 \u2014 Rajat Soni, CFA (@rajatsonifnance) December 2, 2023\n\nNumerous United States economic indicators have surged to record highs, including wages, salaries and household net worth. However, analyst Ed Yardeni suggested that the \u201cSanta Claus rally\u201d might have already occurred earlier this year, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.9% in November.\n\nThis rise reflected diminishing inflationary pressures and robust employment data. Yet, investors remain cautious, with approximately $6 trillion in \u201cdry powder\u201d parked in money market funds, waiting on the sidelines.\n\nDid retail traders miss Bitcoin\u2019s and Ether\u2019s recent gains?\n\nWith no dependable indicator to track retail participation in cryptocurrencies, a comprehensive data set is necessary for making conclusions, beyond relying solely on Google Trends and crypto-related app download rankings. To determine if retail traders have missed out on the rally, it\u2019s essential that the indicators align across various sources.\n\nThe premium of Tether (USDT) in China serves as a valuable gauge of retail demand in the crypto market. This premium quantifies the difference between peer-to-peer USDT trades based in yuans and the value of the U.S. dollar. Excessive buying activity typically exerts upward pressure on the premium, while bearish markets often witness an influx of USDT into the market, resulting in a 3% or greater discount.\n\nUSDT peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nOn Dec. 5, the USDT premium relative to the yuan reached 1%, a modest improvement from the previous weeks. However, it remains within the neutral range and hasn\u2019t breached the 2% threshold for over half a year. Whether retail flow gravitates toward Bitcoin or altcoins, Chinese-based investors primarily need to convert cash into digital assets.\n\nTurning the attention to Google Trends, searches for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d and \u201cbuy crypto\u201d reveal a stable pattern over the past three weeks. While there\u2019s no definitive answer to what piques the interest of new retail traders, these queries typically revolve around how and where to purchase cryptocurrencies.\n\nSearch trends index, weekly. Source: Google Trends\n\nNotably, the current 90-day index stands at approximately 50%, showing no signs of recent improvement. This data seems counterintuitive, given that Bitcoin has surged by 53% in the past 50 days, while the S&P 500 has risen by 4.5% during the same period. Importantly, when viewed over a longer time frame, the current search levels remain a staggering 90% below their all-time high in 2021.\n\nRelated: Why is Bitcoin price up today?\n\nFinally, it\u2019s crucial to delve into derivatives markets, specifically perpetual futures, which are the preferred instrument for retail traders. Also known as inverse swaps, these contracts feature an embedded rate that accrues every eight hours. A positive funding rate suggests a greater demand for leverage by longs (buyers), whereas a negative rate indicates that shorts (sellers) are seeking additional leverage.\n\nPerpetual futures weekly funding rate. Source: Coinglass\n\nNotice that the weekly funding rate for most coins fluctuates between 0.2% and 0.4% per week, signaling a slightly higher demand for leverage among longs. However, during bullish periods, this metric can easily surpass 4.3%, which is not presently the case for any of the top seven coins in terms of futures open interest.\n\nCurrently, the influx of retail participants in this cycle remains elusive, particularly in terms of new entrants displaying excessive optimism. While some analysts point to the trend of the Coinbase app, it\u2019s essential to consider that Binance is currently under scrutiny from regulators, with its founder Changzeng Zhao facing potential legal issues. Consequently, existing retail traders may have migrated from offshore exchanges to Coinbase, rather than heralding a new wave of crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "The United States needs to formally investigate using proof-of-work networks such as Bitcoin (BTC) to protect the country from cyber-inflicted warfare, according to Jason Lowery, a member of the United States Space Force.\n\nIn a four-page letter to the U.S. Defense Innovation Board on Dec. 2, Lowery explained that while Bitcoin is mostly seen as a \u201cmonetary system\u201d to secure funds, few know that Bitcoin can be used to secure \u201call forms of data, messages or command signals.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, this misconception underplays the technology\u2019s broad strategic significance for cybersecurity, and consequently, national security.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Innovation Board is an independent advisory board set up to bring the technological innovation and best practices of Silicon Valley to the U.S. Military. Lowery used the letter to urge the board to advise the Secretary of Defense to investigate the \"national strategic importance\" of PoW systems like Bitcoin.\n\nLowery used the letter to urge the board to advise the Secretary of Defense to investigate the \"national strategic importance\u201d of PoW systems like Bitcoin.\n\nIn his letter, Lowery explained that a proof-of-work system like Bitcoin could work to deter adversaries from cyberattacks due to the \u201csteep costs\u201d of a physically resource-intensive computer in the same way military assets help to deter military attacks against the country.\n\n\u201cProof-of-work mirrors the physical security and deterrence strategies utilized in other domains like land, sea, air, and space,\u201d but instead, it does it in the digital domain, Lowery explained.\n\nBREAKING: US Space Force Major, Jason Lowery sends open letter about #Bitcoin to DOD\u2019s Defense Innovation Board.\n\n\n\n\u201cI contend that reusable proof-of-work networks like #Bitcoin represent an offset strategy for the 21st century.\u201d pic.twitter.com/qiLZ71S5MN \u2014 Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 3, 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s potential cybersecurity applications are huge, according to Lowery, and could play an important role in the U.S. maintaining its position as the world leader.\n\n\u201cAddressing this could be vital for the US to maintain its positions as a global superpower and leader among nations, especially in an increasingly digital and interconnected world plagued by security vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nLowery says it has the potential to kickstart the \u201ccybersecurity revolution\u201d too.\n\n\u201c[It is] the beginning of a cybersecurity revolution. It converts the global electric power grid into a large, physically costly computer, or \u2018macrochip,\u2019 and uses it to physically constrain malicious actors and safeguard a wide range of data and messages traversing the internet.\u201d\n\nLowery concluded Bitcoin\u2019s cybersecurity application aligns \u201cperfectly with a strategic offset\u201d and that the U.S. Department of Defense may have already \u201clost valuable time\u201d by not implementing it into its arsenal.\n\nLowery is also a national defense fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and previously proposed a cybersecurity tool on the Bitcoin base layer in March, which he claims is capable of transforming the country\u2019s national security.\n\nBitcoin \u201cbest defender\u201d of U.S. interests: Coinbase CEO\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate thread on X, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argued that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies could play a pivotal role in helping the United States maintain its dominance with the U.S. dollar, according to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.\n\n\u201cOne idea I\u2019ve been contemplating is that Bitcoin may be the key to extending western civilization,\u201d said Armstrong in a Dec. 3 post, explaining that cryptocurrencies can work in tandem with the U.S. dollar instead of dethroning it.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a natural check and balance that will complement the dollar and be the best defender of long term American interests,\u201d Armstrong added.\n\nOne idea I\u2019ve been contemplating is that Bitcoin may be the key to extending western civilization.\n\n\n\nThe natural trend of whichever country has the reserve currency is to inflate the money supply and increase deficit spending until it loses that advantage.

They may start moving fiat into crypto, as an antidote to inflation.\u201d\n\nArmstrong stressed it\u2019s better to move from dollars to cryptocurrencies than another country\u2019s fiat currency if the U.S. dollar loses its dominance.\n\nHe added that U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) and the emergence of flat coins will play a \u201cmajor role in unifying these worlds.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?"

        "content": "The prices of several major cryptocurrencies jumped on Tuesday amid news of an enormous increase in cryptocurrency trading volumes and the latest signs of the impending first approvals of spot Bitcoin (BTC -4.71%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nAs of 5:42 PM Tuesday, Bitcoin was up 4.8%, exceeding the $44,000 price for the first time since April 2022. Dogecoin (DOGE 2.01%) was also up 4.6%, and Shiba Inu (SHIB -2.70%) had gained 4%.\n\nIs crypto trading reaching a fever pitch?\n\nIn the latest sign of renewed investor interest in cryptocurrencies, an SEC filing late yesterday by brokerage firm Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) revealed November notional trading volumes for cryptocurrencies had surged by 75% sequentially from October 2023 levels. What's more, Robinhood said that the jump in crypto trading came even as November notional trading volumes for equities (stocks) and options contracts remained roughly flat from October levels. It's also a massive positive reversal for Robinhood, considering the firm revealed a 55% year-over-year drop in crypto trading volumes in its third-quarter 2023 report.\n\nHigher trading volumes don't necessarily equate to higher prices for any given asset. But it seems many investors have piled into crypto in recent weeks for fear of missing out on an extended rally in cryptocurrencies that kicked off in mid-October. That's when the SEC declined to appeal a federal court's August reversal of an order preventing crypto-asset manager Grayscale Investments from converting its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund. The move then spurred several hopeful spot bitcoin ETF providers at the time -- including Grayscale, Blackrock, and Fidelity -- to file amended registration statements in anticipation of the SEC's approval.\n\nCryptocurrencies then continued to rise earlier this month as the SEC entered into its first potential approval period for those pending applications. The SEC also reportedly entered into talks with Grayscale at the time regarding the details of its spot bitcoin ETF conversion application.\n\nOn that note, this week has already seen multiple additional amended S-1 filings with the SEC for proposed spot bitcoin ETFs, including revisions from BlackRock and crypto index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management. To many crypto industry watchers, these filings are only the latest signs that the SEC is simultaneously giving similar instructions to multiple potential spot bitcoin ETF providers as it works to iron out the details of their respective applications.\n\nThe crypto ETF deadline to watch\n\nAs I suggested last month, however, investors still shouldn't hold their breath for the first Bitcoin ETF approvals to arrive just yet; note that the first relevant deadline to which the SEC is technically required to respond is Jan. 10, 2024, specifically the date by which it must approve or deny Ark Invest's \"21Shares\" bitcoin ETF application. But rather than approving only Ark's application in isolation at that time, the SEC will almost certainly approve multiple applications at once to avoid giving a so-called first-mover advantage to any single provider.\n\nWith that key Jan. 10, 2024 deadline looming, traders are increasingly excited about the prospect of several new spot bitcoin ETFs providing investors with an easy avenue to diversify into cryptocurrencies. According to data analytics firm CryptoQuant, the resulting capital influx could potentially increase the value of the overall cryptocurrency market by more than $1 trillion over the long term. Given the limited supply of the most popular cryptocurrency tokens, it's easy to see why crypto investors are flocking to put their money back to work before then."

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE): What It Is, History, and Uses - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Dogecoin (DOGE)?\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is a peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency. It is considered an altcoin and was launched in December 2013 with the image of a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Dogecoin's blockchain has merit with its underlying technology derived from Litecoin. Notable features of Dogecoin\u2014which uses the Scrypt algorithm (pronounced ess-crypt)\u2014are its low price and unlimited supply.\n\nKey Takeaways Dogecoin is an open-source cryptocurrency established in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus.\n\nDogecoin features a Shiba Inu, a Japanese dog breed, as its logo.\n\nIt is based on Litecoin and uses the same proof-of-work technology.\n\nDogecoin has a loyal community of supporters who trade it and use it as a tipping currency for social media content.\n\nHistory of Dogecoin\n\nJackson Palmer, a product manager at the Sydney, Australia, office of Adobe Inc., created Dogecoin with Billy Markus, a software developer at IBM. The intent behind the cryptocurrency was to be a way to satirize the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies.\n\n2013\u20132014\n\nPalmer and Markus launched the coin on Dec. 6, 2013. By Dec. 19, the value of Dogecoin jumped 300%, bolstered by China's policy to forbid its banks from investing in cryptocurrency. Markus and Palmer based Dogecoin's code on Luckycoin, derived from Litecoin (a Bitcoin fork). Initially, they used a randomized block mining reward, but that was changed to a static reward in March 2014. Dogecoin uses Litecoin's Scrypt technology and uses proof-of-work (PoW) on its blockchain.\n\n2015\u20132023\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Dogecoin enthusiasts celebrated when the crypto exchange Binance listed the coin. As of December 2023, Dogecoin's market capitalization was nearly $13.1 billion. Dogecoin's infrastructure is slowly gaining traction with fans and developers and continues to operate and trade due to its active community of miners.\n\nDogecoin surpassed a $1 billion market capitalization for the first time in the crypto bull run of 2017 to 2018.\n\nConcerns About Dogecoin\n\nDogecoin, with beginnings as a memecoin and no blockchain utility other than existing, has an established following who argue\u2014with a fair amount of validity\u2014that their crypto does indeed have utility based on how it has been used. Blockchain and cryptocurrency use cases are often associated with longevity and value, so there are those who claim that the cryptocurrency has no utility. These concerns likely have some influence on Dogecoin's market price.\n\nHowever, the community and active developers argue otherwise. Some of their claims for proof of utility are:\n\nIt is used as money, based on a history of tipping and donations for charities and humanitarian initiatives.\n\nMany online retailers accept it as payment.\n\nIt stores value.\n\nDevelopment continues.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be any other Dogecoin uses as of (December 2023) besides blockchain fees, which are very low compared to Bitcoin's and Ethereum's.\n\nBut to be fair, Bitcoin didn't have much utility initially, either. It was a payment method, just like Dogecoin. Bitcoin's blockchain has been improved, and layers have been built that give it more uses, but the same can be said of Dogecoin. So, if Bitcoin has utility, it stands to reason that Dogecoin also does.\n\nDogecoin vs. Bitcoin\n\nDogecoin marketed itself as a \"fun\" version of Bitcoin with a Shibu Inu dog as its logo. Dogecoin's casual presentation suited the mood of the burgeoning crypto community. Its Scrypt algorithm and unlimited supply were an argument for a faster, more adaptable, and more consumer-friendly version of Bitcoin.\n\nDogecoin is considered an \"inflationary coin,\" while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are deflationary because there's a ceiling on the number of coins that will be created. Every four years, the amount of Bitcoin released into circulation via mining rewards is halved, and its inflation rate is halved along with it until all coins are released.\n\nWhere Is Dogecoin Traded? You can purchase Dogecoin (DOGE) by establishing an account with one of many cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Robinhood, a traditional brokerage that enables crypto trades, also supports Dogecoin.\n\nWhat Is Dogecoin Used for? You can spend your Dogecoin with any merchant that chooses to accept it. Many different types of businesses accept DOGE including Elon Musk's SpaceX and the Dallas Mavericks. Many Dogecoin holders use their DOGE to tip content creators on Reddit and other social media platforms.\n\nWhat Will Dogecoin Be Worth in 2025? The future market prices are difficult for anyone to predict. It depends on market conditions, cryptocurrency developments, and investor and user sentiments.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) is a peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency established in 2013. Originally created as somewhat of a joke about cryptocurrency, the token became fairly popular with cryptocurrency fans. The community and developer humor included in the project adds to its appeal and is probably what has made it last longer than many other cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged past the $42,000 mark for the first time since April 2022. This represents a year-over-year increase of 142% in the cryptocurrency value. The milestone came on the back of broad enthusiasm about U.S. interest rate cuts and the imminent regulatory approval for Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\n\nThe solid trading has spread to the ETF world as well. While most of the ETFs have returned handsomely, a few have more than doubled so far this year. These include Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI, Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF BITQ, Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITS, First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry & Digital Economy ETF CRPT and iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF IBLC.\n\n\n\nInvestors' growing belief that the Federal Reserve will halt rate hikes amid cooling inflation is turning attention to potential rate cuts in the upcoming year. The move could push the Bitcoin rally to $44,000 before the spot Bitcoin ETF approval. According to CME\u2019s FedWatch tool, traders are now pricing in a 70% chance for a rate cut by the U.S. central bank by next March (read: 5 ETFs Set to Gain as Inflation Cools Down).\n\n\n\nThe crypto industry is keenly awaiting the SEC's decision on applications for the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, with firms like BlackRock Inc. in the forefront. Bloomberg Intelligence suggests that a series of these products could receive approval by January 2024. Such a development would not only legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of mainstream investors but also provide a more accessible avenue for investment, thereby potentially attracting a fresh influx of capital into the crypto market.\n\n\n\nThe combination of factors has rekindled interest in the crypto market, signaling positive sentiment among retail and institutional investors. With expectations of interest rate cuts and greater demand from ETFs, most traders anticipate the rally to continue, betting on bitcoin\u2019s eventual rise to $45,000 by the end of March 2024.\n\n\n\nBitcoin's performance in 2023 has outpaced other assets like global stocks and gold. The derivative market has also seen significant interest, with record levels of open interest in Bitcoin futures and options. Additionally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which reduces the reward for Bitcoin mining and caps the supply, historically leads to price increases.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) \u2013 Up 181.9%\n\n\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is an actively managed ETF that will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues or profits from bitcoin mining operations, and from providing specialized chips, hardware and software or other services to companies engaged in bitcoin mining.

        "title": "Too Fast, Too Furious? Cryptocurrency as Legal Tender | Royal United Services Institute - RUSI Analysis",
        "content": "Currently, only a handful of countries have decided to adopt cryptocurrency as a legal tender, most prominently among them El Salvador and the Central African Republic (CAR). While attracted by the potential economic and monetary incentives that this move has to offer, both countries have faced significant implementation challenges, threatening to undermine their objectives and any foreseeable economic benefits.\n\nAs more countries \u2013 and developing economies in particular \u2013 have begun to consider integrating cryptocurrency into their national financial systems, these experiments highlight that adopting cryptocurrency as a national legal tender necessitates a certain level of preparedness, including appropriate infrastructure, public education, building trust and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 the establishment of robust financial crime prevention measures.\n\nTwo Routes\n\nWhile El Salvador and the CAR sought to adopt cryptocurrency for similar reasons, their national experiences have been quite different.\n\nEl Salvador took the step of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, with the goal of increasing investment and assisting citizens that lack access to traditional financial services. Initially, to integrate Bitcoin into its economy, the country contracted third-party companies to develop centralised cryptocurrency wallets known as \u2018Chivo Wallets\u2019 and cryptocurrency ATMs. This government-funded project allows citizens to transfer funds quickly through the use of the \u2018lightning network\u2019 \u2013 a solution that increased the speed of Bitcoin transactions \u2013 and without commission fees.\n\nThe CAR moved to adopt Bitcoin in April 2022, but the government reversed its decision when the Constitutional Court declared the proposal unlawful a month after it was introduced. After this reversal, the government took a different route and created a partially Bitcoin-backed cryptocurrency, known as the Sango Coin, to be introduced in phases. The first phase would allow the public to buy into the crypto-backed currency, while the subsequent phases would allow the use of the currency for certain government services, like purchasing citizenship, e-residency and land. The CAR\u2019s Constitutional Court ultimately rejected a scheme that would have allowed foreign investors to acquire citizenship for $60,000 worth of Sango Coins or a 250 square metre plot for $10,000 worth of Sango Coins, ruling that nationality cannot be priced in a market and that residency requires physical presence in the country.\n\nAt the onset of the project, the coin also promoted the tokenisation of natural resources within the country. Despite the project not initially gaining traction, as of July 2023, the CAR National Assembly revisited the concept and passed a law allowing the tokenisation of land and natural resources.\n\nSame Motives, Different Challenges?\n\nThe countries\u2019 respective political leaders generally cited the potential economic benefits as their underlying rationale for promoting cryptocurrency as a national legal tender. Both countries regard this as an innovative solution to economic stagnation, poor revenue and foreign direct investment, and a reliance on third country-backed currencies. In the CAR, for example, its national currency \u2013 the CFA Franc \u2013 is backed by France and pegged to the Euro, with several restrictions in place, such as keeping 50% of the CAR\u2019s foreign assets with the French Treasury. Some saw the CAR\u2019s interest in cryptocurrencies as a political move away from France in an effort to lessen reliance."

        "title": "Buying frenzy puts some Grayscale crypto funds at 'absurd' premiums - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nSome cryptocurrency funds run by the world\u2019s largest crypto manager are trading at as much as eight times their underlying value amid an unprecedented buying frenzy.\n\nThe sharp price gains are the latest sign of the passing of the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d. The price of bitcoin has jumped to a 20-month high of $42,000 amid expectation of the imminent launch of US exchange traded funds directly tracking the world\u2019s largest digital token.\n\nThe mania has spread to a host of private trusts operated by Grayscale. The company\u2019s Filecoin Trust is trading at $34.25, 721 per cent above its net asset value of $4.17, having hit a premium of more than 1,000 per cent in November.\n\nIts trust tracking solana, the third-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ether, is at a premium of 302 per cent, while those investing in chainlink, livepeer, lumens and Decentraland\u2019s mana token are priced at between twice and four times their NAV.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd. I feel the investor doesn\u2019t really understand what they are getting into,\u201d said Bradley Duke, chief strategist of ETC Group, which runs more than $1bn in European-listed crypto exchange traded products.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what [investors] could be thinking buying at these prices,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America, at Morningstar. \u201cA lack of understanding can easily be part of it.\u201d\n\nThe funds can only be traded via OTC Markets Group, formerly known as the \u201cpink sheets\u201d market, where over-the-counter secondary trading in pre-existing shares takes place. Shares cannot be redeemed, while new shares can only be created if Grayscale carries out a private placement exercise, meaning there is no arbitrage mechanism to bring prices back in line with the underlying holdings.\n\nHowever, most of the premiums only emerged, or widened sharply, in November, coinciding with a rally in the price of many cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThere is a very strong appetite for crypto products at the moment as the crypto winter has melted. Investors are allocating to crypto in larger allocations and also diversifying from bitcoin and ethereum,\u201d said Michael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale.\n\nHe believed some investors may be willing to pay well over the odds for Grayscale\u2019s trusts in order to access cryptocurrencies \u201cthrough a product wrapper that is known to them, is familiar and gives them added protections that they are used to seeing when they invest in any other asset\u201d. The alternative is to trade via an unregulated crypto exchange.\n\nFor many of these tokens, Grayscale\u2019s funds are the only regulated products available to US retail investors.\n\n\u201cBecause there are so few regulated products out there, the investors who don\u2019t want to, or can\u2019t, invest directly in these assets have little choice,\u201d said Duke. \u201cAs a result, these products end up trading at these huge premiums. It\u2019s a function of the structure of the products.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s down to accessibility,\u201d said Armour, although he added that cryptocurrencies \u201chave such high volatility it might be [that investors] don\u2019t even care\u201d at what price they are buying.\n\nAnother contributory factor may be limited liquidity, given the small size of some of the trusts. The Filecoin Trust has assets of just $464,000 and the solana vehicle, the largest currently trading at a significant premium, at $10.8mn.\n\n\u201cThese are fairly illiquid products and, as solana spot has seen, these illiquid products are seen as proxies by those who can\u2019t buy solana directly in their funds or prefer not to,\u201d said Gautam Chhugani, senior analyst, global digital assets at AB Bernstein.\n\nDuke argued that the large departures from net asset value showed the benefit of the European model. According to this, in contrast, scores of exchange traded products that invest directly in a rich array of cryptocurrencies \u2014 including those operated by ETC Group \u2014 \u201ctrack the underlying almost perfectly\u201d.\n\nThey are analogous to ETFs in the US but need to call themselves ETPs because they fail to meet European Ucits regulations on portfolio diversification.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has so far not permitted any such \u201cspot\u201d cryptocurrency ETFs in the US. Instead it only allows ETFs that invest in the futures market. Expectation is widespread that BlackRock and rival operators will be given the green light early next year.\n\n\u201cWithout regulated products these kinds of [price] anomalies are likely to exist,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI think we are very lucky in Europe . . . the ETP wrapper is far more efficient with the ETPs trading at or very close to NAV.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the US private trust structure \u201cis problematic. And Grayscale recognise it\u2019s problematic,\u201d he added.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\nGrayscale has fought a long battle with the SEC to allow it to convert its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), at $24.1bn the world\u2019s largest bitcoin fund, into an ETF. In August, a federal appeals court in Washington DC ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale\u2019s application to convert GBTC.\n\nAlthough this trust still trades at a discount to NAV, this discount has narrowed to a 28-month low of 8.7 per cent \u2014 from a nadir of almost 50 per cent in December 2022 \u2014 in anticipation of the likelihood of Grayscale being given the go-ahead to convert it into an ETF.\n\nThe company has also filed with the SEC to transform its $6.2bn Ethereum Trust (ETHE), again the largest such vehicle in the world, into an ETF. This trades at a discount of 14.6 per cent, a far cry from the near-60 per cent level seen at the turn of the year.\n\nSonnenshein said that, in the fullness of time, he would like to see the rest of Grayscale\u2019s 17-strong product suite follow suit. \u201cThe goal would be to uplift all these products to ETFs,\u201d he said."

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here .\n\nStep aside stocks\n\nBitcoin briefly topped $42,000 Monday, hitting its highest level in more than a year. The world's largest cryptocurrency was lifted by hopes of approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and growing bets on U.S. interest rate cuts. Spot gold prices touched $2,100 an ounce, hitting a record high as investors rushed into the safe-haven asset.\n\nWall Street catches a breath\n\nU.S. stocks markets slipped Monday, with investors questioning if markets climbed too fast, too soon following five straight weeks of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.11% at close. The S&P 500 dropped 0.54% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.84% amid a Big Tech shares selloff. Asia-Pacific markets fell across the board, with Japan's Nikkei 225 down 1.4% and South Korea's Kospi off by 0.7%.\n\nOf Airlines and DoJ\n\nAfter Alaska Airlines agreed to buy rival Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal Sunday, many argue that the airlines' executives may now spend many more months trying to convince regulators the acquisition should go ahead. This comes less than a year after the Justice Department sued to block JetBlue Airways' $3.8 billion cash acquisition of budget carrier Spirit Airlines.\n\nBig costs, bigger layoffs\n\nSpotify said it was laying off 17% of its workforce, or about 1,500 employees, as it aims to reduce costs and adjust for a slowdown in growth. Shares of the music-streaming service jumped more than 7% Monday. Software provider Twilio also said it would lay off roughly 5% of its workforce, or about 300 jobs, following underperformance of a unit that activist investors have targeted.\n\nCrime and punishment\n\nThe Department of Justice announced Monday a major Swiss bank, Banque Pictet, had admitted to conspiring with U.S. taxpayers and others to hide over $5.6 billion from the Internal Revenue Service. The private banking division of the 218-year-old Pictet Group will pay about $122.9 million in restitution and penalties as part of an agreement with the prosecutors.\n\n[PRO] Wall Street\u2019s new e-commerce darling\n\nWall Street analysts are betting big on one Chinese e-commerce giant and it's not Alibaba. In fact, this firm has a current market capitalization of nearly $190 billion, compared with Alibaba's $185.8 billion. Here's the full story."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) faces sharp volatility as the new week begins with BTC price action focusing on $42,000 \u2014 can it endure?\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency, fresh from weekend gains that topped 10%, is still keeping traders guessing over its next move.\n\nWhile a trip to $40,000 was well anticipated, the question now is whether or not the latest move represents the beginning of a new trend or, conversely, a new bull trap.\n\nAppraisals currently vary widely, with bullish and bearish perspectives battling for vindication.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at the most important support and resistance levels now in play after recent BTC price performance reshapes the market landscape.\n\nBTC/USD is currently trading at around $41,600, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, having hit 19-month highs of $42,160 earlier on the day.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart.

This, Material Indicators suggests, is no coincidence.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve been saying all week, I thought Bitcoin would continue to climb as long as whales could keep attracting bid liquidity to the range, or they lured enough to distribute into,\u201d it explained in accompanying commentary.\n\n\u201cThey succeeded in attracting over $120M to the active trading range so wasn\u2019t surprised to wake up to BTC taking out $42k, before the selling began.\u201d\n\nBTC/USDT order book liquidity data.

        "content": "00:00\n\nIt's about the move in bitcoin. Having a look at 42 k. Hi John. It did hit 42,000, which is the highest level since April 2022, but now it's pared back some of those gains but still up it's now at around 41,500. And of course this enthusiasm is really fuelled by the speculation that the US FCC will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF by next year and that includes from the likes of BlackRock. And of course if the Fed is done hiking interest rates. So the last time this level was seen was around April 2022 when we saw the collapse of the US, the STABLECOIN. And if this rally holds, this will be the biggest yearly gain for Bitcoin since 2020. So it's going to be three years since then. And while 42,000 is a big round number, crypto investors are happy. It's still a far cry from the nearly 69,000 all time high that we've seen a few years back. We're still around 39% from there. And if you look at Bitcoin's weekly relative strength index, so that's a momentum gauge. Bitcoin is hovering around overbought levels. So we'll see if this rally holds. But across the board, it's a green on the screen for the crypto universe. We have Bitcoin up ether up, Dogecoin also up and Bitcoin cash. And of course that's really banking on the fact that there's a cross at a rally gold this up and even assets and money market funds are also up John."

However, although assets under management have risen over 100% for the year, they remain 47% below the all-time high of $86.6 billion in 2021.\n\nRegionally, Canada, Germany and the U.S. accounted for the most substantial inflows, adding $79 million, $57 million and $54 million, respectively.

However, short bitcoin products registered minor inflows of $3.6 million last week, ending a three-week run of outflows.\n\nEther products registered a further $31 million of inflows, bringing its five-week streak to $134 million.

BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale are among the firms seeking approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for both spot bitcoin and spot ether ETF applications.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $41,836, according to The Block\u2019s price data \u2014 up over 150% year-to-date.
