        "title": "How Much of All Money Is in Bitcoin? - Investopedia",
        "content": "How Much Is Bitcoin Worth?\n\nOn Sep. 10, 2023, 1 BTC was worth approximately $25,758. There were more than 19.48 million bitcoins circulating, giving it a total value of over $500 billion. This is much less than in 2021, when its value reached more than $64,000\u2014giving it a total value of about $1.2 trillion at the time.\n\nKey Takeaways One bitcoin was worth $25,758 as of Sep. 10, 2023.\n\nAll the bitcoins in the world were worth over $500 billion.\n\nThe combined value of bitcoin was equivalent to just 0.11% of the world's money.\n\nBitcoin was worth only about 3.4% of the world's gold supply.\n\nAll cryptocurrencies combined accounted for about 0.23% of the world's money.\n\nBitcoin and the Money Supply\n\nTo get a sense of how much of the world's money is in bitcoins, we must determine the total amount of money. As it turns out, this is not the easiest question to answer. Such a calculation might take into account dozens of categories of wealth, including banknotes, precious metals, money market accounts, and debt. Luckily, Credit Suisse has already done the work\u2014the bank calculated total global wealth to be $454.4 trillion at the end of 2022.\n\nThat leaves Bitcoin at about 0.11% of the estimated total value of wealth globally.\n\nMarket capitalization is considered a controversial metric, especially when applied to cryptocurrencies. Although it's a convenient way to assess the total value of an asset, it is highly subject to manipulation.\n\nBitcoin vs. Gold\n\nHow does Bitcoin compare to gold? After all, some people still consider gold to be the safest of safe haven assets. It is certainly the standard to which other currencies must be compared. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that about 244,000 tons of gold had been mined as of Sep. 10, 2023. There are 32,000 ounces of gold in one ton, and the price of gold per ounce was about $1,919.08 as of the market close on Sep. 8, 2023. So, the total value of all gold can be estimated as:\n\n( 244,000 tons of gold x 32,000 ounces per ton ) x $1,919.08 per ounce = $14.98 trillion.\n\nIn total, the value of all Bitcoin was about 3.4% of the value of all above-ground gold reserves.\n\nOther Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin is the largest and best-known cryptocurrency in the global economy. However, it is far from the only one. If we combine Bitcoin with Litecoin, Monero, Ethereum, and all other significant cryptocurrencies, the total value comes to roughly $1.04 trillion (as of Sep. 10, 2023). That was about 0.23% of the value of all money.\n\nWarning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, illiquid, and vulnerable to slippage and price manipulation. Before investing, make sure you understand the risks associated with virtual assets.\n\nWhat Percentage of all Money Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin's percentage of all money is much lower than you might expect. On Sep. 10, 2023, the value of all bitcoins was 0.11% of all money.\n\nWhat Is the Total Value of all Bitcoins? The combined value of all bitcoins on Sep. 10, 2023 was about $504 billion.\n\nFor How Much Does Bitcoin Sell? On Sep. 10, 2023, 1 BTC was worth about $25,758.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, one of the thousands of new digital or virtual currencies available globally. It can be used as a store of value, a way to exchange value, or as a speculative investment. Its value changes daily, sometimes tens of dollars or more. It is a volatile asset that changes its market capitalization and percentage of total money almost daily.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Crypto markets tumbled Monday as traders got spooked by the potential selling pressure from bankrupt exchange FTX. Bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 2% and briefly dipped to as low as $24,963 during U.S. morning hours, its first time below the $25,000 level since mid-June. It has pared some of those losses since, now trading at around $25,140, 2.6% lower in the last 24 hours."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market fell to start the week as traders turned their focus to new inflation data and digested the latest in the SEC's legal battle with Ripple.\n\nBitcoin fell more than 2.8% to trade at $25,004.45, according to Coin Metrics. Ether, whose moves follow those of bitcoin as a \"blue chip\" crypto asset rather than another altcoin, was last trading lower by about 4% at $1,540.10.\n\nBitcoin briefly dipped below $25,000, the first time below that key support level since June.\n\nAltcoins led crypto market declines to start the day, after the Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday argued the need to appeal July's landmark court ruling in its case against Ripple. XRP dropped 5%, according to Coin Metrics, along with the Polygon token. Polkadot 's coin lost 4%, while Binance Coin , Solana's sol token and litecoin were down by about 3% each.\n\n\"It feels like fatigue, and with general pullback in liquidity from market makers any move lower tends to be more volatile,\" said Darius Tabatabai, co-founder of Vertex Protocol. \"That said, the environment is challenging with volumes still low overall and users not returning to crypto in droves as of yet.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin was trading below US$26,000 on Monday afternoon in Asia, while Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses. The market is also under pressure after news that the collapsed FTX crypto exchange may soon liquidate its US$3.4 billion in crypto holdings. Asian equities traded mixed. U.S. futures gained ahead of crucial inflation data release while European bourses gained ahead of the central bank policy meeting later this week.\n\nSee related article: FTX sues LayerZero Labs to recover US$21 million\n\nAll top 10 cryptos drop\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.15% to US$25,811 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 0.56%, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cCurrently, Bitcoin\u2019s price is trading without a clear direction amidst cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin, which leads the entire crypto market, will be influenced by various technical factors in the absence of news and legal decisions related to the cryptocurrency market in the coming week,\u201d Rania Gule, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage firm XS.com told Forkast.\n\n\u201cI believe that the crucial support level of US$24,995 will determine whether Bitcoin\u2019s price goes up or down. A clear and strong break below this level would send Bitcoin toward the very important support level at US$24,000, which would indicate a clear bearish trend reversal. In the worst-case scenario, the selling momentum in this case could push the price down to around US$21,915, which is roughly the mid-March level,\u201d Gule said.\n\nEther, the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token, fell 0.78% to US$1,611 in the last 24 hours, and dropped 1.63% in the last seven days.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked on Sunday, resulting in losses for some of Buterin\u2019s followers, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. Hackers posted links to a scam non-fungible token (NFT) project on Buterin\u2019s Twitter page, advising users to connect their crypto wallets before withdrawing the funds.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cEthereum price indicators continue to show signals of the ongoing bearish trend, supported by a breach of the trendline that took the price below the critical support level of US$1,687. This paves the way for a potential 27% drop in ETH price. I believe the price could reach a significant level of US$1,200, with intermediate support at US$1,366,\u201d Gule of XS.com pointed out.\n\nThe crypto market is also facing downward pressure from the latest FTX news. The collapsed cryptocurrency exchange is likely to receive approval on Sept. 13 to start liquidating its crypto holdings, according to a tweet from blockchain analysts Whale Alert. After filing for bankruptcy in November last year, the exchange still holds an estimated US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets.\n\nJohn Stefanidis, chief executive of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO, said, \u201cThe recent dip in value of altcoins could be attributed to the anticipated authorisation of the liquidation of assets held by FTX. With a portfolio encompassing billions in cryptocurrency assets, a potential liquidation could significantly influence market values, notably affecting Solana, Aptos, Dogecoin, Matic, TON, and XRP.\u201d\n\nToncoin was the biggest loser, declining 3.38% to US$1.70 in the past 24 hours, and losing 9.96% in the past seven days.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP was the second biggest loser, dropping 2.91% to US$0.4857 on the day and 3.54% on the week. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) submitted a filing last Friday to push the court of the Southern District of New York to appeal its ruling on the agency\u2019s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The SEC requested the court to review its prior ruling by Judge Analisa Torres that posed \u201cknotty legal problems,\u201d according to the filing. In July, a summary judgment by Judge Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, but sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not.\n\nRipple Labs also announced that it will acquire Nevada-based crypto infrastructure startup Fortress Trust, giving Ripple a regulatory license in the state of Nevada.\n\nElsewhere, the Group of 20 (G20) meeting under India\u2019s presidency, said during the weekend that member countries will work together to develop a coordinated global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, cross-border cooperation and information sharing.\n\n\u201cCrypto assets and how regulation can be put in place \u2013 we contributed to a roadmap so [that] over the next month progress can be made in that area,\u201d Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of International Monetary Fund said at the conclusion of G20 leaders summit in India\u2019s capital New Delhi on Sunday.\n\nCongratulations to India on a successful #G20 presidency. Its theme of \"one earth, one family, one future\" resonated with global leaders, who reached an important consensus on ways to address the global challenges confronting us. My takeaways from \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3's successful @g20org summit. \u2014 Kristalina Georgieva (@KGeorgieva) September 10, 2023\n\nHowever, one of the key challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry globally is the delay in implementing these recommendations at a national level, according to Caroline Bowler, chief executive of Australian digital asset exchange BTC Markets.\n\n\u201cWhile international organizations are setting the framework for a harmonized regulatory environment, it is imperative that governments and regulatory authorities act promptly to translate these guidelines into actionable regulations. Delayed implementation could hinder the industry\u2019s growth, create uncertainty, and potentially leave investors and consumers exposed to risks,\u201d Bowler said in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization dropped 0.54% to US$1.03 trillion, while market volume gained 36.82% to US$20.63 billion.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume, transactions drop\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.85% to 2,119 in 24 hours to 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, dropping 3.53% on the week, with Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon indexes also declining.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume dropped 4.08% to US$8,757,370 in the past 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data. NFT transactions dropped over 10% at the same time.\n\n\u201cAs we head into the slowest months of the year one has to wonder how low we can really go, and if we can fall to Feb. 2021 levels where we saw US$35-50 million in sales,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nAmong blockchains, Ethereum topped the rankings by sales volume, which rose 2.67% to US$4.7 million. Mythos and Polygon networks ranked second and third respectively.\n\nAmong collections, Mythos-based DMarket topped rankings although its sales volume fell 7.76% to US$1,012,238 in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cFootball NFTs were hot with the kickoff of the NFL season. Both DraftKings with their fantasy football NFTs and NFL All Day with their pure collectibles saw millions in sales over the past seven days,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nSales of Polygon-based DraftKings gained 45.96% to US$579,756, ranking it the third biggest collection by sales volume.\n\nAsian equities mixed; U.S. futures, European bourses gain\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden in Vietnam on Sept. 11. Investors are looking forward to latest U.S. inflation data due for release later this week. Image: President Biden/Twitter\n\nMajor Asian stock markets traded mixed on Monday as investors await the latest U.S. inflation data due for release later this week. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component Index, as well as South Korea\u2019s Kospi gained. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index dropped at the end of trading hours.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.\n\nA recent rise in oil prices and stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. services recorded last week have fueled inflation concerns in the U.S., Reuters reported.\n\nThe CPI prediction of 3.8% is still higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term goal of bringing the annual inflation below 2%. The Fed last raised the interest rate in July to between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest since early 2001.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened as of 8 p.m. in Hong Kong on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the green.\n\nIndia\u2019s benchmark index Sensex rose 0.79% at the close of trading hours on Monday.\n\nEuropean bourses \u2013 the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 \u2013 gained on Monday. Investors are looking forward to the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB\u2019s) policy meeting outcome on Thursday, which is expected to indicate whether the central bank will increase interest rates further. ECB policymakers are divided over raising rates again, amid slowing economic activity and persistent inflation that remains above the 2% target.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot get yourself to hike in September, the case will not be stronger in October as economic data will likely worsen, and inflation in September will come lower quite a bit,\u201d said UBS chief European economist Reinhard Cluse, who expects a 25 basis-point increase, according to a Reuters report.\n\n(updates with equities section.)"

This is a staggering sum. An astronomical $509,563 as a mere transaction fee.\n\nThe transaction that paid nearly 20 BTC ($500,000) fee a few hours ago looks like an exchange or payment processor with buggy software.\n\n\n\nThey've received 60,000+ txns and sent 60,000+ txns from the same address (bad practice) and likely calculated their change output incorrectly. pic.twitter.com/s44Yc8S2ia \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) September 10, 2023\n\nThe revelation of this financial fireworks display was down to no other than Whale Alert, that digital Big Brother ceaselessly watching over large-scale crypto transactions.

Because a blockchain is stored across a network of computers, it is very difficult to tampe Read this Term as this incredible fee came to light. People are obviously looking over their shoulders and wondering what's happening after Bitcoin's challenging summer.\n\nNow, let's put this into perspective, shall we? The average Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term transaction fee hovers around a mere $1.410. A paltry sum, really, and a far cry from the astronomic anomaly we're dissecting here.\n\nBut, there's more to this story. The astute observer would recognize that average fees can oscillate wildly, much like a volatile roller coaster at a cryptocurrency theme park. For instance, during the cryptocurrency boom of 2017, fees sky-rocketed to nearly $60, causing more than a few sleepless nights among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nNow, let's dig into the cryptic reasons behind this exorbitant transaction fee. Was it an inadvertent slip of the finger, a hapless misconfiguration in the labyrinthine maze of transaction software, or did this user have some clandestine motive known only to themselves and the blockchain gods?\n\nThe cryptocurrency community, ever a cauldron of opinions and witty remarks, reacted with a spectrum of emotions. Some didn\u2019t believe a word of it, while others simply couldn't resist cracking jokes about the future of finance and the eye-watering costs of utilizing Bitcoin. One user wryly pointed out that this fee surpassed the reward for mining three brand-new Bitcoin blocks \u2014 the very incentive for those tireless miners to validate transactions.\n\nThe consensus appears to be that it was an end user mistake or a software mistake. Jameson Lopp, a notable figure in the cryptocurrency community and the Co-Founder of the wallet Casa, highlighted the fact that the account was a withdraw-only hot wallet tied to an enterprise and suggested that it was down to a software error from an exchange or payment processor address.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll all be fine. Chun Wang, the Co-Founder of Bitcoin mining pool F2Pool, claimed that the overpaid fees will be temporarily held. The user responsible has a three-day window to claim these fees. If unclaimed within this period, miners will redistribute these funds, according to Wang. Let\u2019s all breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nBut, perhaps most intriguingly, this extravagant episode has reignited the age-old debate about Bitcoin's scalability and efficiency. It's the perfect fodder for the proponents of alternative cryptocurrencies who now have a fresh canvas upon which to paint their critiques of the crypto kingpin.\n\nWhatever happened, it\u2019s a hell of a tale. Remember. Type slowly. Double check everything. Never rush to hit \u2018enter\u2019."

        "content": "Citigroup Funds Bitcoin Pollution\n\nCiti has been expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency sector by developing services that enable buying and selling Bitcoin, and providing underwriting for Bitcoin mining and other crypto companies to raise capital. These dirty investments contradict Citi\u2019s net zero pledges and commitments to sustainability.\n\nCitigroup, one of the largest funders of fossil fuels in the world, is investing in yet another fossil fuel lifeline \u2013 Bitcoin.\n\nCiti has been expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency sector by developing services that enable buying and selling Bitcoin, and providing underwriting for Bitcoin mining and other crypto companies to raise capital. These dirty investments contradict Citi\u2019s net zero pledges and commitments to sustainability.\n\nYet, Citi has not publicly acknowledged Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact or addressed how its investments and products are tied to Bitcoin\u2019s emissions. The operation of large traditional financial companies like Citi in the crypto sector brings a new level of trust and accessibility to Bitcoin, in addition to providing much-needed capital. Together, this support can drive up the price of Bitcoin and, in turn, its energy use and GHG emissions. Most of that energy is generated by dirty fossil fuels which drives the climate crisis and creates local air pollution that harms public health.\n\nOne way Citi is connected to Bitcoin is through investment and trading services. In 2021, Citi announced that it would offer bitcoin futures trading for some institutional clients. Citi\u2019s Securities Services team is also partnering with Swiss crypto firm Metaco to build Citi\u2019s digital asset custody capabilities\u2013basically, secure accounts to store digital assets which could eventually include bitcoin. Citi\u2019s Global Wealth Investments arm also formed a Digital Assets Group to expand into crypto. News outlets reported that Citi hired 100 people to work in a blockchain and digital assets division. Yet, there are no signs of that expertise being put to work cleaning-up Bitcoin and creating innovative solutions to move Bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism away from the current polluting Proof-of-Work system.\n\nCiti has also helped Bitcoin and crypto industry companies access capital necessary for expanding their operations. The bank provides vital underwriting services for several major crypto industry companies, which helps these firms issue shares and bonds to raise money. Access to capital markets through reputable investment banks like Citi is vital for the expansion of the Bitcoin industry.\n\nOne example of this dynamic was Citi\u2019s role as joint manager for a 2021 initial public offering (IPO) by Bitcoin miner Iris Energy. That IPO raised $231.54 million, which the company said would help develop its facilities and buy more mining equipment. Citi controlled 22.5% of the shares and earned $3.65 million in fees. (1)\n\nCiti was also the lead manager for Canaan Inc.\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) in 2019. Canaan is a China-based producer of ASICS, the specialized computers used for Bitcoin mining, that is also expanding into the operation of mining facilities including in Kazakhstan where coal energy use is widespread and Bitcoin mining has met backlash and government restrictions. Citi controlled 54.35% of the shares offered and earned an estimated $3.91 million in fees on the IPO that raised $90 million.\n\nIn 2021, Citi was also the sole manager of a $500 million bond private placement for Galaxy Digital Holdings, a crypto investment and finance company that provides financial services for Bitcoin miners and is expanding its own mining operations. (2) Galaxy Digital said it intended to use the capital to fund growth initiatives. Later in 2022, Galaxy helped Bitcoin miner Argo avoid bankruptcy by issuing them a $35 million loan and buying their mining facility in Helios, TX.\n\nCiti has also invested in the largest U.S. crypto exchange, Coinbase, that enables retail and institutional investors to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin. The services provided by exchanges like Coinbase help drive adoption of Bitcoin and its price which ultimately leads to more energy use. In 2021, Citi was a joint lead manager for the private placement of two different $1 billion bonds for Coinbase, a large raise of capital for the nascent crypto industry. Citi also owns nearly $800,000 in a Coinbase bond. (3)\n\nWhile Citi does not have an extensive assessment management division, the company still holds shares in 10 Bitcoin mining companies worth about $125,000 including Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms.\n\nDespite expanding services for the crypto industry, Citi appears to know Bitcoin is bad for the climate. In 2021, Citi analysts published a report documenting Bitcoin\u2019s growing energy use and warned that the carbon emissions would likely meet public and regulatory scrutiny. The report highlighted how Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption would accelerate alongside its price. Yet, Citi\u2019s plans to reach net zero in company financing activities by 2050 and in operations by 2030 as well as reporting on investments in carbon-intensive sectors don\u2019t address Bitcoin related investments and services. Citi is also a founding member of the UN\u2019s Net Zero Banking Alliance and joined the RMI Center for Climate Aligned Finance and the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).\n\nCiti needs to live up to their climate commitments and be a leader in cleaning up Bitcoin and helping create innovative solutions that chart a sustainable path forward for cryptocurrencies.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Data on underwriting and shareholding was collected from the Bloomberg Terminal, Bloomberg Finance L.P.\n\n2 Data from league tables on the Bloomberg Terminal, Bloomberg Finance L.P.\n\n3 Based on data from Bloomberg Terminal, Bloomberg Finance L.P."

        "title": "5 emerging 'new Bitcoin' alternative projects on the crypto market in 2023 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency and the largest by market cap. However, the top coin has been in a downtrend since November 2021 and has a number of limitations, most notably a lack of support for the smart contracts that have enabled NFTs, DeFi, crypto gaming and more.\n\nA growing number of projects are now building on Bitcoin to expand its utility and chart a new future for the original crypto. These high-risk \u201cnew Bitcoin\u201d alternatives can sometimes have more upside potential and offer faster, cheaper and greener transactions than the original BTC.\n\nNew Bitcoin alternatives\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at five of the new Bitcoin alternatives that are bringing Bitcoin into the future.\n\n1. Bitcoin BSC (BTCBSC) \u2014 Moving Bitcoin onto the BNB Smart Chain for faster and cheaper transactions\n\nBitcoin BSC is a newly-launched project that retools Bitcoin for Binance\u2019s BNB Smart Chain. It\u2019s a BEP-20 token that\u2019s compatible with a huge range of crypto wallets, DApps, DeFi protocols and more.\n\nSource: Bitcoin BSC\n\nPart of what makes Bitcoin BSC worth mentioning is that transactions on the BSC blockchain cost less than transactions on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.\n\nBitcoin BSC is also advertised to be far greener than Bitcoin, using less than 0.01% as much energy. The protocol is secured by a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism rather than Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work, so there\u2019s no computationally expensive mining required.\n\nInstead, BTCBSC investors are promised the option to stake their tokens to the project to validate transactions to receive additional BTCBSC coins.\n\nRight now, BTCBSC is on presale at bitcoinbsc.io priced at $0.99. The Bitcoin BSC project has gotten off to a strong start, raising more than $1 million its first week.\n\n2. BTC20 (BTC20) \u2014 Ethereum-based Bitcoin alternative with wide compatibility for DeFi and more\n\nBTC20 is another emerging Bitcoin clone project that\u2019s migrating BTC onto a faster, cheaper blockchain with support for proof-of-stake validation and smart contracts. In this case, the blockchain underlying BTC20 is the widely used Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThere are several benefits to reinventing Bitcoin on Ethereum. As an ERC-20 token, BTC20 is compatible with almost all major crypto wallets, DeFi protocols, crypto gaming platforms and decentralized marketplaces.\n\nSource: BTC20\n\nBTC20 has slightly higher transaction costs than Bitcoin BSC, largely because the Ethereum blockchain is so heavily used. However, there\u2019s a major convenience factor to having all of the biggest projects on one chain.\n\nThe BTC20 presale sold out more than $6 million worth of tokens at $1 per token and was listed on Uniswap in August. The current BTC20 price is $1.20.\n\n3. Bitcoin SV (BSV) \u2014 Greener proof-of-work blockchain processing 50,000 transactions per second\n\nBitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision, better known as Bitcoin SV or by its token BSV, recycles the original Bitcoin code to try to build a newer, faster and cheaper blockchain.\n\nSource: Bitcoin SV\n\nThe biggest and most consequential change that Bitcoin SV makes is allowing larger block sizes. This has a massive impact on the protocol\u2019s throughput. Bitcoin SV can process up to 50,000 transactions per second compared to around 7 transactions per second for Bitcoin.\n\nIt also dramatically lowers the effective energy cost of mining. It would take mining thousands of blocks on Bitcoin to achieve what mining a single block on Bitcoin SV does. So potentially, Bitcoin SV found a way to make proof-of-work validation far more environmentally sustainable, avoiding the carbon-emission concerns that plague Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin SV\u2019s blockchain also enables support for smart contracts and Bitcoin NFTs. It\u2019s quite forward-looking and has an active development team behind it, so it could adapt to changing crypto industry conditions in a way that Bitcoin cannot.\n\nBSV is currently priced at $30.5, down 42% over the past year.\n\n4. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) \u2014 2017 Bitcoin hard fork held by Grayscale Investments\n\nBitcoin Cash was an early fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that\u2019s still going strong today. It adopts the same principle as Bitcoin SV of using larger block sizes with more transactions to reduce costs and speed up processing.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash can currently manage around 200 transactions per hour. While that pales in comparison to Bitcoin SV, there are benefits to being more established. Bitcoin Cash was launched in 2017 and has a market cap of $3.75 billion, compared to less than $600 million for Bitcoin SV.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. That means it contains the same data as the Bitcoin blockchain up until the fork took place in 2017. This isn\u2019t the case for most other Bitcoin alternatives, which started from scratch when they launched.\n\nThe price of BCH is up nearly 50% over the past year, with a lot of that gain coming around a court decision in favor of Grayscale Investments\u2019 spot Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale has a Bitcoin Cash trust that some investors think could eventually be turned into its own spot ETF.\n\nOn top of that, the launch of a Bitcoin spot ETF has the potential to prop up all Bitcoin alternatives. An ETF makes the crypto market more accessible to everyone, and a subset of new investors are likely to start exploring Bitcoin alternatives that offer faster transactions and more features.\n\n5. Bitcoin Gold (BTG) \u2014 Bitcoin hard fork that makes mining accessible to all\n\nBitcoin Gold arose from another 2017 hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. At the time, ASIC processors were making Bitcoin mining increasingly challenging and boxing out individual miners. In the new world of ultra-heavy-duty mining equipment, only VC-backed miners could make money from Bitcoin mining.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Gold\n\nBitcoin Gold addressed this by modifying the mining algorithm to make it easier for transaction blocks to be mined. The project also limited mining to GPU processors, which are relatively affordable and already installed on many modern gaming computers and consoles.\n\nIn effect, this created a version of Bitcoin that\u2019s mined by individuals, not corporations. It looks a lot more like the early days of Bitcoin than Bitcoin does today.\n\nThis approach has kept Bitcoin Gold relatively small, and it currently has a market cap of only $222 million, according to CoinMarketCap. However, BTG has a devoted following and it\u2019s one of the only proof-of-work projects remaining for which individual miners can be reasonably competitive."

        "title": "Bitcoin starts week below US$26,000; Ether dips after hack on Vitalik Buterin\u2019s X account; more rate hike - Forkast News",
        "content": "There was red ink across the crypto market Monday morning in Asia as Bitcoin dipped below the resistance level of US$26,000. Ether also fell to near the US$16,000 mark after a hack on the X account of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses. Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers with a 24-hour slide of over 6%. Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX could soon get the greenlight to liquidate its US$3.4 billion in crypto holdings, adding to selling pressure in the market. U.S. stock futures traded higher after Wall Street logged weekly losses Friday. Investors now look ahead to the release of more U.S. inflation data later in the week for clues on upcoming interest rate policy.\n\nLatest FTX news depresses crypto market\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.25% in the last 24 hours to US$25,831.97 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. It lost 0.53% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly traded above US$26,000 last Friday. But it soon lost that support level and remained range bound over the weekend at around US$25,900.\n\nEther, the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token, fell 1.12% to US$1,616.79, and dropped 1.18% over the past seven days.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked Sunday, leading to losses totalling around US$691,000 for some of Buterin\u2019s followers, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. Hackers posted links to a scam non-fungible token (NFT) project on Buterin\u2019s Twitter page, advising users to connect their crypto wallets before withdrawing the funds.\n\nButerin\u2019s father confirmed in a tweet Sunday that his son had been hacked and was restoring his X account. The alleged scam post has now been removed from the account. Buterin himself is yet to comment on the hack.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses in the past 24 hours. Solana led the losers, falling 6.17% to US$18.25 for a weekly loss of 6.80%.\n\nOn Sunday, a Wall Street Journal report predicted a September pause in the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hiking cycle. The report \u201cprobably had many investors re-thinking their valuations \u2014 not just for crypto but for risk assets in general,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nThe market is also facing downward pressure from the latest FTX news. The collapsed cryptocurrency exchange is likely to receive approval on Sept.13 to start liquidating its crypto holdings, according to a tweet Saturday from blockchain analysts Whale Alert.\n\n\ud83d\udea8POTENTIALLY BIG SELLING NEXT WEEK\n\n\n\nCrypto exchange FTX will likely get approval to liquidate its assets 13th of September.\n\n\n\nThey had $3.4b worth of crypto in April.\n\nCurrent proposed plan is to sell up to $200m worth of crypto every week. \u2014 Whale (@WhaleChart) September 9, 2023\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy in November 2022, the exchange still holds an estimated US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets. Part of the bankruptcy plan set up for the firm allows for the sale of up to US$100 million in crypto assets per week, which can be extended to US$200 million under certain circumstances.\n\nCrypto analysts suggest the news could weigh on the market after gains earlier in the summer. Blockchain research firm IntoTheBlock tweeted Sunday that \u201cdespite positive news about Visa and a potential spot ETH ETF, FTX\u2019s impending US$3 billion liquidation could be dictating market movement.\u201d\n\nThe selling pressure from FTX will cause altcoins to underperform Bitcoin throughout the remainder of the year, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in a Sunday LinkedIn post.\n\nThe potential selling of FTX\u2019s crypto holdings could hit Solana particularly hard, according to Rachael Lucas, crypto technical analyst at Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets. The token \u201cforms a substantial portion of these assets, with an estimated value of approximately $685 million. This impending event has heightened the sense of uncertainty among SOL investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is on the verge of a \u201cdeath cross\u201d \u2014 where the token\u2019s short-term, 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) moves below its long-term, 200-day SMA. That could signal a coming slide in Bitcoin prices, Lucas said.\n\nAs of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, Bitcoin\u2019s 50-day SMA sat at US$27,658.19, with a 200-day SMA of US$27,608.57. Following the previous Bitcoin death cross on Jan.14, 2022, the token\u2019s price dropped over 10% within seven days.\n\n\u201cThe looming question that occupies the minds of market participants pertains to whether Bitcoin will chart a similar course in response to this bearish technical pattern or has the market already priced in this event?\u201d Lucas said.\n\n\u201cThis uncertainty is exacerbated by the forthcoming release of U.S. inflation figures, with technical indicators currently signalling the potential for further downside,\u201d she added.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.74% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 50.61% to US$20.25 billion.\n\nInvestors await key US inflation data as China slump slows\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures edged up as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. All three major U.S. indexes closed moderately higher on Friday but logged weekly losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the winners on Friday with a 0.22% uptick, but ended the week 0.86% lower.\n\nThe main stock indexes in Asia were mixed on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and South Korea\u2019s Kospi moved higher. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 1.38% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 also posted a 0.19% loss.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland last Friday.\n\nA recent rise in oil prices and stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. services recorded last week have fueled inflation concerns in the U.S., Reuters reported Saturday.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that the CPI print could come in higher than expected (with) the price of oil pushing higher,\u201d Phil Blancato, chief executive officer of U.S.-based investment advisory firm Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, said in the report.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem where ultimately the Fed may be pushed into a corner, and while they might take a pause because of the lag effect, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re done,\u201d said Blancato.\n\nThe CPI prediction of 3.8% is still higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term goal of reducing the annual inflation rate below 2%. The Fed raised the interest rate in July to between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level since early 2001.\n\nThe U.S. CPI data on Wednesday is unlikely to affect Fed thinking ahead of its September meeting, Mohamed A. El-Erian, an adviser to Germany-based financial services firm Allianz, tweeted on Monday. But it could influence future rate decisions, beginning November, he said.\n\nTwo items lead the week ahead for the global #economy and #markets:\n\nAn @ECB meeting where I put the probability of a 25 basis point hike at 55% (yes, it\u2019s that close); and\n\nThe US CPI #inflation print which is unlikely to alter in any significant way the high expectation that\u2026 \u2014 Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) September 10, 2023\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September. It gives a 53.5% chance for another pause in November, down from 57.4% last Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s CPI index posted a slim annual increase of 0.1% in August. The increase has eased deflationary pressure on Beijing slightly\n\n\u201cMany data we\u2019re seeing now shows that the economy\u2019s slump may be slowing in the coming months,\u201d Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., told Bloomberg. Yeung also noted a slowdown in China\u2019s export slump in August. But he said the slowdowns should not be read as a sign of long-term recovery just yet.\n\n\u201cIt will be more of a stabilization instead of a complete rebound,\u201d Yeung said.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Bitcoin stands at the edge of a bearish breakdown, with a small possibility that the $25,000 support level could hold.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Bitcoin (BTC) broke from its parallel range between $25,500 and $26,500, falling to an intraday low at $24,950. A daily close below $24,750 threatens a drop to the sub-$20,000 range, but there\u2019s a slight chance that the bullish momentum could revive.\n\nAccording to pseudonymous trader Horse, Bitcoin at $25,000 presents a short-term buying opportunity, as it\u2019s the \u201cbest area to trap sellers\u201d and \u201carguably the best place for long contextual\u201d risk-to-reward ratio.\n\nI feel like the chances that the market smokes this level after the first major test is slim.\n\n\n\nSeems like the best area to trap sellers, and arguably the best place for long contextual R:R\n\n\n\nI'll catch a falling knife. pic.twitter.com/eFNMzBCPJW \u2014 HORSE (@TheFlowHorse) September 11, 2023\n\nThe price action in global markets and on-chain indicators tapping historical lows could give buyers hope that a positive trend could thrive.\n\nIs DXY tapping out?\n\nBitcoin tends to maintain a negative correlation with the U.S. dollar and a positive correlation with stocks.\n\nOn Sept. 11, when the S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock market indexes were trading higher, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) was falling.\n\nThe DXY is tapping its long-term range high levels around 104.8 points, hinting at the possibility of a negative price reversal. A bearish dollar could add tailwinds to Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nDaily chart of the DXY. Source: TradingView\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) print in the United States on Sept. 13 will likely provide a decisive direction to the global markets.\n\nBitcoin traders could secure profits at $26,000\n\nAccording to the latest report by on-chain analytics outlet Glassnode, Bitcon\u2019s price drop over the last few weeks has caused several metrics to tap historical lows.\n\nThe current market conditions are characterized by low liquidity and low trading volumes. While this complicates bulls\u2019 ability to push the BTC price through multiple resistance levels, long-term holders could start to accumulate as bullish hype cools down.\n\nAccording to Glassnode:\n\n\u201cRealized Profit and Loss are similarly at levels equivalent to the 2020 market, highlighting what is arguably a complete and total wash-out of the exuberance from the 2021 bull market.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin\u2019s negative price action since mid-August has seen a \u201cvast majority\u201d of short-term supply plunge \u201cinto an unrealized loss,\u201d which could act as a potential short-term reversal level.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s short-term holder supply in profit.

        "content": "Bitcoin remains under 26,000 as investors await fresh us economic data this week. Joining us now to discuss the crypto markets is Maple head of growth and capital markets. Quinn Thompson. Welcome back, Quinn. Yeah, thanks for having me. Good seeing you. So, um you know, before we get into this whole discussion of uh some of the, the CP I and PP I data that we're gonna have come out this week. Uh You're, you're kind of looking at the ETF news and you see that as a as I I as it's kind of the next big thing happening here, particularly uh a spot E ETF for, for E, you know, we're as close as possible uh that we've ever been to a Bitcoin spot ETF with the, with the latest ruling in the federal courts against uh the sec regarding gray scale, why the, the market hasn't really taken off since then? So what is it that, you know, that the rest of the market doesn't? Yeah, I mean, so the ETF is definitely the, the, the biggest news I'd say holding the crypto markets up today and, and probably over the next coming months the difficult part is it, it creates a better conduit for, for capital inflows into the space, but you still need that catalyst for those inflows. And if you look at, you know, interest rates are about up about 50 basis points since uh Bitcoin's most recent local peak at 31 K, uh you know, liquidity and capital inflows continue to kind of decrease. And so we just haven't seen a catalyst for people to get excited. There continues to be quite a few headwinds whether it's B news, other FTX type of cell pressure. Uh No one really wants to step in. And if you look at the trading action over the last few, few weeks and months, you know, it, it tells you that much. It's, it's everyone's pretty apathetic towards, towards crypto at this stage. We're, we're, we're, we're expected to get some PP I and CP I data this week. Uh As you know, obviously it's the end of August is now behind us. So we're gonna know what's going on there. What exact, you know, where do you see that falling? Because that of course, is going to dictate where interest rates are going to go or at least give a hint as to where interest rates are gonna go. What, what's your bet? Yeah, I think the, you know, I'm not, I'm not sure about this exact print, but if you look across the commodity complex, I I it feels that, you know, the economy is not as weak as, as people might be thinking, you know, labor data has been mixed, uh inflation data has definitely come down but, but very well could have seen a bottom over the summer and, and commodities due to, you know, recent, recent supply issues. And despite all the talk of China and, and the rest of the world being very weak, uh you know, you can look to commodities as, as being pretty strong here. And so my gut says, you know, we've probably seen a local bottom in inflation and, and one of the things causing weakness in tech assets over the last couple of weeks is, is those rising expectations and, and interest rates coinciding with it. Yeah. Now I'm surprised Lawrence didn't ask you this about ETF S. We've had spot ETF S up here in Canada where I'm sitting right now and the excitement hasn't been there. So, I mean, what do you do? You really think it's gonna be this, this big catalyst that everyone is thinking it's gonna be given that it's been available in some other parts of the world. And the excitement has kind of just been exactly how the markets have looked over the past few weeks. No, that's, that's very accurate. I mean, as I kind of said it, it, you know, it, it's not an instant rep pricing of, of the space, but you would expect some uplift in prices as you know, it creates a, you know, better, better avenue for, for capital inflows. If you think across the US, there's, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars managed by Ria S wealth advisors and other asset managers who physically cannot access uh digital currencies, Bitcoin Ethereum. And so the ETF really allows that access to, to be much improved. And, and also, you know, if you think of a traditional wealth advisor in, in a regional part of the States, they can't make money. If they, they tell their clients to invest in Bitcoin, they have no way to, you know, it has to be done through traditional uh investment routes and, and getting an EPF approved will, will allow that to be supported in, in, you know, all these different accounts. So I think it is big news. I just, I just think there needs to be other uh catalysts to get the space going again and, and we'll see how big, I mean, do you have an estimate on, on what you think will ultimately take up? Uh the TFS? How, how big do you think are we looking at here? Because, I mean, the Canadians haven't been impressive as usual. Yeah. Well, the, the Bitcoin futures et FBI to is, is been pretty successful, I would say for the type of product it is. Um I, I believe that's about a billion. The, you know, just look to the gray scale uh G BC. There's I believe about 16 billion at, at today's prices uh locked up there. So tough to say the discount's still there. Um You know, and, and so there could be some outflows if, if it returns to NAV, but, but overall, you know, I, I would expect over the coming years is to be 30 40 50 billion. And, and um you know, that that's a meaningful size of, of the overall crypto and Bitcoin market at, at this stage. Yeah, and talk to us about some of the issues challenges, I guess when it comes to capital flow right now in the digital asset space. Yeah, I mean this the stable coin supply is probably the easiest gauge you can look to there's other some fun metrics um that, that some people post but overall, it's, it's pretty bleak and US DC supply has been been cut in half which is kind of the western regulated stable coin. Obviously, Tether has been uh pretty strong in its growth which you know, take, take of it where you will. But overall, uh you know, investment and you look at venture capital raising uh that it's continues to hit new lows, trading volumes continue to hit new lows. And so there's just this kind of lack of, of excitement and and broader interest in the space. I think part of that has to do with the regulatory uh nature. But, but you are starting to see the currents kind of shift underneath where some of this, you know, or, or less value or creative building and, and project use cases are being washed out. You know, you're seeing more and more startups, kind of shut it down where they haven't found product market fit and, and fail where they haven't been able to raise additional capital and that's healthy. You know, it's unfortunate, but, but, you know, venture capital is a, is a type of investing where you, you hit a home run on one or two of every 10. So I think it's a little return to normal and, and you know, we're starting to see that capital then float to the more uh you know, a creative and u real use cases like stable coins, payment rails and, and that's one bright spot, transactions across stable coins have continued to increase despite, you know, the broader Bitcoin weakness. So I think that's kind of what will lift us out of this, this bear market is, is, you know, big players like visa and other payment companies start to adopt these rails and, and that just continues to onboard new users into the space. Quinn, thanks so much for joining us this morning and taking a look at the markets with us. Yeah, thanks so much. That was Maple Head of growth and capital markets, Quinn Thompson."

        "content": "In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box, former PayPal President David Marcus shared his vision for Bitcoin, aiming to transform it into a global payment network. Marcus, who is the CEO of Lightning Network infrastructure company Lightspark, emphasized the importance of expanding Bitcoin's utility beyond just a store of value.\n\nDuring the interview, Marcus highlighted the significant strides Bitcoin has made over the past decade, evolving from an obscure digital currency to a recognized store of value and hedge against inflation. However, he argued that Bitcoin could play a much broader role in the global financial ecosystem.\n\nMarcus proposed that Bitcoin has the potential to become a truly global payment network, similar to PayPal but operating on the decentralized Bitcoin network. He emphasized the need for Bitcoin to evolve further, offering faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions, making it accessible to a broader audience.\n\nDavid Marcus is helping lead the charge to expand Bitcoin's utility in this area. In his current role as CEO of Lightspark, he has committed \"to doing whatever it took\" to realize the full potential of the Bitcoin Lightning Network. \"Because it\u2019s time for the world to have a universal open protocol for payments,\" Marcus continued.\n\nThough, scaling Bitcoin into a massive global payment network is not without challenges. Bitcoin's scalability issues has had its long-standing concerns. However, ongoing technological developments, such as the Lightning Network, aim to address these issues and enhance Bitcoin's capabilities.\n\nRegulatory hurdles also pose a significant challenge. Governments around the world are scrutinizing the Bitcoin industry, with varying degrees of acceptance and regulation. Marcus acknowledged the importance of working with regulators to ensure the compliance and legitimacy of Bitcoin as a global payment solution.\n\nWhile significant challenges lie ahead, including technical and regulatory hurdles, the idea of Bitcoin serving as a decentralized, efficient, and widely accepted means of payment holds the potential to revolutionize the financial industry, making transactions faster and more accessible on a global scale.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a narrow range this week and is on target to form the third consecutive Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart. The cryptocurrency markets did not receive any support from the United States equities markets, which ended the week on a negative note. The S&P 500 Index dropped 1.3% while the Nasdaq closed down 1.9%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s weakness has dragged several altcoins lower, with many testing multi-week lows. This indicates that the broader crypto market is in a firm bear grip. Negative markets make it difficult for buyers to identify short-term bullish trades as rallies hardly sustain. However, it could be a good time for long-term investors to build a portfolio.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAccording to a recent Amberdata report, 24% of asset management firms are appointing senior executives dedicated to the implementation of digital strategies. Down the line, 13% more firms plan to adopt a digital assets strategy. This indicates \u201cseriousness about implementation as well as senior management buy-in,\u201d the report added.\n\nCould Bitcoin break out to the upside, boosting buying interest in altcoins? Let\u2019s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that are showing promise in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading near the $26,000 level for the past few days, indicating a tussle between the bulls and the bears.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe downsloping moving averages indicate advantage to bears but the positive divergence on the relative strength index suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The indicators are not giving a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nTherefore, it is better to wait for the price to either sustain above $26,500 or dive below $24,800 before placing large bets.\n\nIf bulls overcome the obstacle at $26,500, the BTC/USDT pair could soar to the overhead resistance at $28,143. On the other hand, a fall below $24,800 could clear the path for a collapse to $20,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has been trading near the moving averages on the four-hour chart, indicating a lack of interest from both the bulls and the bears. This tight-range trading is unlikely to continue for long and may lead to a range expansion within the next few days.\n\nOn the upside, a rally above $26,500 will indicate that the advantage has tilted in favor of the buyers. That may start an up-move to $27,600 and eventually to $28,143.\n\nAlternatively, if the price breaks below $25,300, the selling could pick up and the pair may retest the Aug. 17 intraday low of $25,166.\n\nToncoin price analysis\n\nToncoin (TON) has pulled back to the 20-day exponential moving average ($1.69). In an uptrend, a correction to the 20-day EMA usually offers a low-risk entry opportunity.\n\nTON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is likely to act as a strong support. If the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. The TON/USDT pair could first rise to $1.89 and thereafter attempt a rally to $2.07.\n\nInstead, if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are bailing out of their positions. That could open the doors for a possible drop to $1.53 and next to the 50-day simple moving average ($1.45).\n\nTON/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to sink the price below the immediate support at $1.72, but the bulls have held their ground. The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative territory increases the risk of a downside breakdown.\n\nIf the $1.72 support cracks, the pair could skid to $1.66 and later nosedive to the strong support at $1.53. Contrarily, if bulls propel the price above the moving averages, it will suggest the start of a stronger recovery to $1.90 and subsequently to $2.\n\nStellar price analysis\n\nStellar (XLM) has staged a smart recovery in the past few days, indicating that the buyers are attempting a comeback.\n\nXLM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe XLM/USDT pair broke above the 20-day EMA ($0.12) on Sept. 4, and the bulls thwarted attempts by the bears to yank the price back below it on Sept. 5 and 6. This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the 20-day EMA into support.\n\nThe price has reached the 50-day SMA ($0.13), which is behaving as a roadblock. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that they have not given up much ground. This suggests that the bulls are not rushing to the exit. If the price breaks above the 50-day SMA, the pair could soar to $0.15 and later to $0.17.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 20-day EMA.\n\nXLM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to halt the recovery at the overhead resistance at $0.13 but the bulls have not given up much ground. The rebound off the 20-EMA shows that lower levels continue to attract buyers. If the price maintains above the overhead resistance, the pair could start an up-move to $0.15.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly drag the price below the 20-EMA. That could accelerate selling and tug the price to the 50-SMA.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Pepe price will continue to fall in September\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nMonero (XMR) has held the uptrend line support for the past few days, indicating buying at lower levels. The price has reached the 20-day EMA ($143), which is an important level to keep an eye on.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the start of a sustained recovery. The XMR/USDT pair could then climb to the 50-day SMA ($151), where the bears may again mount a strong defense. If this obstacle is cleared, the pair could surge to $160.\n\nThe bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to protect the 20-day EMA and pull the price below the uptrend line. If they manage to do that, several stops may be hit. That could sink the pair to $130.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price action on the four-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nIf the price slips below the 50-SMA, the bears will try to pull the pair to the support line of the triangle. Contrarily, if the price rises above the 20-EMA, the pair could reach the resistance line. A break above or below the triangle could signal the start of a trending move.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) has been stuck between the moving averages, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that the price has been trading above the downtrend line.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($1,119) is moving up gradually but the RSI near the midpoint suggests a lack of bullish momentum. Buyers will have to propel and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($1,157) to signal the start of an up-move to $1,227.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price re-enters the downtrend line. The MKR/USDT pair could then slump to the strong support at $980. This level is likely to witness strong buying by the bulls.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price has been oscillating between $1,083 and $1,170 for some time. The flattish moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate a slight advantage to the sellers.\n\nOn the downside, the important support to watch out for is $1,102 and then $1,083. Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the moving averages, it will suggest that the bulls are on a comeback. The pair may then rally to $1,170.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

CryptoQuant\u2019s UTXOs in Loss metric tracks when large numbers of these UTXOs are worth more than they were when the BTC was originally bought.\n\nCurrently, more of these are in loss compared to their original acquisition price than at any time since March 2020.\n\nAt the time, BTC/USD dropped 60% to its lowest levels since March 2019 \u2014 lows which were never seen again.\n\nConsidering the current data from UTXOs in Loss, CryptoQuant contributor Woominkyu ventured that, like in March 2020, Bitcoin might be seeing, or already bouncing back from, a curveball selling event.\n\nHe summarized:\n\n\u201cGiven that the current level of the \u2018UTXOs in loss\u2019 indicator mirrors that of the Black Swan event between March and April 2020 (due to the Coronavirus), those anticipating another Black Swan event might want to consider whether we are already in the midst of the event they are waiting for.\u201d\n\nBitcoin UTXOs in loss chart. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nIn percentage terms, 38% of UTXOs were in loss at the end of August, a figure last seen in April 2020.\n\n\u201cWhen many UTXOs are in loss, investors might be more inclined to sell, hinting at market anxiety. Conversely, when most UTXOs are profitable, it suggests an optimistic outlook and a stronger holding sentiment among investors,\u201d Woominkyu added.\n\nUnderwater Bitcoin speculators grow\n\nBitcoin meanwhile remains locked in a tight range amid a lack of overall BTC price trend.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin speculators now own the least BTC since $69K all-time highs\n\nWith neither a breakout nor breakdown willing to complete, cost basis data likewise shows current spot price caught between the acquisition prices of various investor cohorts.\n\nThis \u201cRealized Price\u201d \u2014 the price at which the supply last moved, divided by age group \u2014 shows that short-term holders fall into aggregate loss when BTC/USD is below around $27,000.\n\nA full capitulation event, however, has yet to be recorded on-chain.\n\nBitcoin Realized Price chart (screenshot).

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) begins a key macro week in a weak place as 2023 BTC action begins to look like a \u201cdouble top.\u201d\n\nAfter a disappointing weekly close below $26,000, BTC/USD is struggling to catch a bid amid a return to low volatility.\n\nAnalysts, already predicting downside, continue to forecast new local lows, and liquidity conditions are increasingly supporting their argument.\n\nAre there any silver linings on the horizon? One on-chain metric suggests that Bitcoin is \u201cin the midst\u201d of a major shakeout akin to March 2020.\n\nA rebound to \u201cfair value\u201d may also come courtesy of Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), which has almost fully retraced its year-to-date gains to reach its lowest levels since the first week of January.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at these topics and more in the weekly rundown of key BTC price triggers.\n\nWeekly close makes BTC price double top a reality\n\nBitcoin closing out the week below key trendlines was already expected, but the reality may be worse than many care to admit.\n\nThat is the conclusion of popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital, who warned that a close below $26,000 would \u201clikely\u201d validate a double top structure on the BTC weekly chart.\n\nThis currently takes the form of Bitcoin\u2019s two 2023 local tops, both above $31,000, with a retracement to $26,000 in between, as data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nBTC price weakness now risks continuation downhill thanks to the latest close.\n\n\u201cWeekly close below ~$26,000 likely confirms the Double Top breakdown,\u201d Rekt Capital wrote in part of an X post.\n\nFurther analysis noted that $26,000 had formed support for three weeks running and that finally deciding its fate was thus significant on weekly timeframes.\n\nWith BTC/USD nonetheless seeing its lowest weekly close since March, popular chartist JT told X followers that there was still room for optimism. This, he argued, was in the form of the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) near $25,600.\n\n\u201cThis week candle was a spinning top doji, which is a candle that indicates indecision,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s quite remarkable though is that the past three weekly closes have closed within $400 of each other! Talk about boring and flat price action! The good news is we closed well above our weekly 200EMA ($25.6K).\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-week chart with 200 EMA. Source: TradingView\n\nCointelegraph previously covered the significance of the 200-week EMA within the current BTC price environment.\n\n$20,000 futures gap next?\n\nBitcoin slowly heading lower has refueled a debate over its ability to repeat classic chart behavior.\n\nThis focuses on the largest cryptocurrency\u2019s habit of \u201cfilling gaps\u201d on CME futures markets, which appear on weekends and holidays.\n\nHere, the difference in price between one week\u2019s close and the next week\u2019s open often forms a magnet for BTC price action in the future \u2014 but not always immediately.\n\nBTC/USD often \u201cfills\u201d gaps within days or even hours of futures markets resuming, but over time, some have been left behind. A major gap on the radar currently lurks at $20,000.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only real CME gap that we have in terms of downside movement from current price levels,\u201d Rekt Capital explained in his latest YouTube update on Sept. 6.\n\nHe continued by noting a now-filled gap from June 2022 was now acting as resistance after functioning as support and resistance at various points since its creation.\n\n\u201cThis CME gap has been filled multiple times already and it\u2019s been flipped into a new resistance,\u201d he said, noting that the aforementioned double top completing would likewise feed into a return to the $20,000 zone.\n\nUnder such circumstances, a potential BTC price range would form, with the $20,000 gap and previously filled gap functioning as support and resistance, respectively.\n\nBTC/USD chart with CME gaps highlighted (screenshot). Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube\n\nOthers, however, were undecided about the probability of such a far-off gap being revisited.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has a long history with CME futures Gaps. These Gaps tend to get filled sooner or later. But there\u2019s no guarantee they will,\u201d popular trader Titan of Crypto argued.\n\nUploading a chart of historical gaps, he referenced another that is yet to fill, this time below $10,000.\n\n\u201cFor some of you who are in crypto for quite some time, you may recall the $9.6k gap from September 2020. Back then everyone was expecting this gap to get filled so they can finally buy Bitcoin again. Guess what? It remains unfilled to this day and many got back in at $20k+, fomoing like crazy,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is a gap that is still unfilled at $20k-$21k. Will it get filled?

        "title": "NFTs vs. cryptocurrency: Key differences and how they work - TechTarget",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens are the two most popular applications that run on blockchain. While there is considerable overlap in how the two work, there are significant differences between them. The uses for cryptocurrency and NFTs also vary widely.\n\nCryptocurrency is an encrypted form of digital currency that relies on blockchain technology and doesn't depend on financial institutions to verify transactions. NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets that are stored on a blockchain and cannot be duplicated or cloned. Let's take a closer look at NFTs and cryptocurrency and examine their similarities and differences.\n\nWhat are NFTs? NFTs are unique digital assets that do not necessarily have a physical manifestation. They represent photos, music, videos, trading cards and other items. Nearly any digital asset, such as a collectible digital character, virtual real estate or original social media post, can be created and purchased as an NFT. Among the somewhat esoteric NFTs is one created by Jack Dorsey -- the original founder of Twitter -- of the first message ever sent on Twitter. NFTs are stored on distributed ledger technology, of which blockchain is a common type. The digital ledger lets NFTs be managed, bought and sold online. Every transaction on a blockchain is written to this digital ledger, which publicly records each NFT transaction to substantiate who owns the item. NFTs commonly have a value attached to them, which can be set by the creator, that can increase or decrease based on market demand. Blockchain technology makes the ledger essentially immutable, which means it usually can't be tampered with. This article is part of Blockchain for businesses: The ultimate enterprise guide Which also includes:\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of blockchain technology? 7 must-have blockchain developer skills Download 1 Download this entire guide for FREE now! The NFT creator keeps the copyright for the item and the right to copy it as many times as they want. Although the creator might create numerous copies of the original, if the buyer of the NFT wants to make copies, they must first get permission from the creator, and each copy is considered a unique NFT. NFTs are sold in collaboration with auction houses or in NFT marketplaces, such as the following: NBA Top Shot , an online marketplace that runs on the Flow blockchain where users can bid on, purchase and sell digital highlights of NBA players. An NBA Top Shot video featuring LeBron James honoring Kobe Bryant sold for close to $400,000.\n\n, an online marketplace that runs on the Flow blockchain where users can bid on, purchase and sell digital highlights of NBA players.

Venly, formerly known as Arkane Network, is a digital collectibles marketplace for general collectors and gamers -- Venly is based on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange and Ethereum and Polygon blockchains.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is an encrypted form of digital currency. Unlike traditional currency issued by governments, cryptocurrency doesn't rely on a government or financial institution for its creation or use. Cryptocurrency is typically stored in a crypto wallet and lets anyone send and receive payments. When an individual transfers cryptocurrency, the transactions are recorded in the immutable distributed ledger. Several organizations have issued their own cryptocurrencies -- often referred to as tokens -- which let people trade specifically for the product or service a company provides. An individual must exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency required to purchase the product or service. Examples of popular cryptocurrencies are the following: Bitcoin , a cryptocurrency created in 2009. People can buy and sell bitcoin using different currencies in marketplaces called bitcoin exchanges .\n\n, a cryptocurrency created in 2009.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs With a $100B Promise Put Old Funds in Danger - Wealth Management",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Spot Bitcoin ETFs haven\u2019t even been approved in the US, and yet already some see them as an existential threat to the futures-based funds that came before them.\n\nBlackRock Inc. leads a group of firms awaiting word from regulators on their filings to launch what would be the first US ETFs linked to the spot price of the largest cryptocurrency. Grayscale Investments is also in the mix after scoring a legal victory in its quest to convert its $16 billion Bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund. Proponents are optimistic that the heft of the issuers involved and Grayscale\u2019s recent court win may finally tilt the odds in favor of these funds being approved.\n\nRelated: Court Paves Way for Spot Bitcoin ETF in Grayscale Ruling\n\nAs of now, the closest US fund investors can come to investing in the cryptocurrency is through products that track Bitcoin futures contracts. When these funds debuted in October 2021, their coming out broke records \u2014 but they weren\u2019t able to sustain that same level of excitement for long, and their combined market value has since leveled off at about $1 billion. The arrival of spot-based funds \u2014 which analysts say would track the price of the coin more closely and at a potentially lower cost \u2014 may threaten even that toehold.\n\n\u201cWe would expect the assets and volume to coalesce around one or multiple spot-Bitcoin ETFs because they are superior products for most types of investors,\u201d said James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cNew money, particularly those looking to buy and hold over longer time periods, will be attracted to a spot product, which is also likely to be cheaper and more efficient than the current futures ETFs on US exchanges.\u201d\n\nRelated: Crypto Enthusiasts Stoked by Bitcoin-ETF Hype Shrug Off Ether-Fund Push\n\nIf approved, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market has the potential to grow into a $100 billion juggernaut in time, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.\n\nBitcoin-futures ETFs, of which the roughly $914 million ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (ticker BITO) is by far the largest, received a warm welcome because their approval marked a watershed moment for the crypto industry. After a years-long fight for such funds in the US, issuers were finally able to entice investors with a product that offered easier exposure to the digital-assets market.\n\nBut the funds have trailed Bitcoin\u2019s rally this year. The lag can, at least partly, be explained by which specific futures contracts the ETFs hold, and the expense associated with rolling them over as they expire, BI\u2019s Seyffart has found. These roll costs eat into returns, causing the funds\u2019 performance to become unmoored from the asset they track.\n\n\u201cThe BTC-futures ETFs will probably experience significant outflows if spot-based ETFs are approved,\u201d said K33\u2019s Vetle Lunde. \u201cThey are far less straightforward in addition to incurring higher costs due to rolling, thus leading to underperformance over time.\u201d\n\nWith spot ETFs more likely than futures-based ones to be a reflection of real-time supply and demand, their introduction may cause \u201cmigration of trading activity and liquidity\u201d away from Bitcoin futures markets in the US, \u201cto the extent spot Bitcoin ETFs replace futures-based Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d wrote JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou in a July note.\n\nA ProShares spokesperson said \u201cinvestor demand for BITO, the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin-linked ETF, continues to be strong, with an average daily trading volume of nearly $135 million in 2023 that puts it in the top 5% of all US ETFs. A regulated futures market offers strong custody protections and robust liquidity, making BITO a compelling choice for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nGrayscale Faces \u2018Instantaneous\u2019 Fee War in US Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nBitwise Urges SEC to Greenlight Bitcoin Spot ETFs All at Once\n\nSpot funds may offer compelling reasons of their own, including potentially much lower fees than what the current futures-ETF lineup charges. Fee wars are a familiar phenomenon in the increasingly crowded ETF arena \u2014 both in new categories as well as established asset classes \u2014 and many are expecting fierce competition between different issuers should Bitcoin ETFs launch.\n\n\u201cIf investors are faced with the choice of spot versus futures, they will likely always go with a spot ETF unless they\u2019re specifically looking for a leveraged or inverse product,\u201d said Roxanna Islam, associate director of research at VettaFi. \u201cSpot ETFs will have to come out with lower fees to remain competitive. This could be even more significant if we see a mass approval of spot ETF products where a lower fee could be what differentiates an ETF from its peers.\u201d\n\nWhichever way the rivalry among new issuers shakes out, they may not leave much room for anyone else.\n\n--With assistance from Sam Potter."

Founder Bankman-Fried, along with other executives like Nishad Singh, Gary Wang, and Caroline Ellison, allegedly received a staggering USD $2.2 billion in cash, crypto, equity, and real estate.\n\nBesides the digital assets holdings, the court document reveals the company\u2019s extensive real estate portfolio comprising 38 condos, penthouses, and other properties. The fate of these properties, like the rest of FTX\u2019s assets, remains uncertain amid the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nUnder the leadership of the new CEO, John Ray III, FTX has embarked on a mission to reclaim funds previously donated to politicians and charitable organizations. These efforts include endeavouring to recover donations made to institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which has decided to return USD $550,000.\n\nBesides that, FTX is pursuing payments made to high-profile athletes and sports teams as celebrity endorsements.

Many of these celebrities are facing class action lawsuits filed by former FTX's customers whose funds are now caught up in the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nBesides that, FTX has taken legal action against LayerZero Labs, a cross-chain protocol, seeking the recovery of an investment of $21 million.

Bulls are aiming to break the $26,000 resistance for a potential rally, but a break of $25,500 could lead to further losses,\" Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO of Unocoin, said.Bitcoin has been trading in a relatively tight range around the $26,000 level, and market indicators are sending mixed signals, making it difficult to determine whether the bulls or bears currently have the upper hand. The downsloping moving average suggests a bearish trend, but the positive divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) indicates a potential reduction in selling pressure.Bitcoin continues to trade sideways from $25,500 to $26,500 with low volumes. The bulls are defending the crucial support level of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci retracement Level). If it holds and sustains above the support then we may expect the bulls to resume the up move whereas a break below the support will lead to further downfall. $32,500 will be the major hurdle for bulls and to witness a rally BTC needs to break, close and sustain above the resistance level of $32,500.Quick Glance (Source: coinmarketcap.com , data as of 12:40 hours, IST on September 11, 2023)Bitcoin $25,808 -0.20%Ethereum $1,614 -0.71%Tether $0.9997 -0.01% BNB $211 -0.72%XRP $0.4918 -1.69%Cardano $0.2478 -0.64%Dogecoin $0.06165 -0.88%Solana $18.28 -1.42%Polygon $0.5217 -1.24% Litecoin $61.48 -0.64%Polkadot $4.13 -1.33%Tron $0.07921 -0.07%Shiba Inu $0.000007365 -1%(Note: Price change in last 24 hours)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is moving to seize millions of dollars in Bitcoin that a teenage hacker had stolen from crypto executives four years ago. Prosecutors are also making sure they recover the sports car he bought with the stolen Bitcoin back, too.\n\nLast week, a federal judge signed off on an order demanding that Ahmad Wagaafe Hared turn over $5.2 million in Bitcoin that he stole back in 2016, according to a report in The San Francisco Standard. The Bitcoin and the car were stolen as part of a SIM-swapping scheme hatched by Hared and two co-conspirators between 2016 and 2018.\n\nSIM-swapping is when a hacker deceives a cell phone carrier into handing over control of a target\u2019s cell phone by pretending to be the phone\u2019s owner. The tactic is a classic social engineering tactic used by hackers to get access to personal data to steal from their targets\u2014or to bypass text-message based second-factor authentication measures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, Harred\u2014then 18 and living in Tucson, Arizona\u2014worked in concert with named co-conspirator Matthew Gene Ditman of Nevada to trick customer support representatives of cell phone providers into disclosing details about the SIM cards assigned to the accounts of cryptocurrency executives in northern California.\n\nThough the executives are not unnamed, the region is home to Silicon Valley and an entire ecosystem of cryptocurrency companies and start-ups alike. Coinbase, the biggest exchange in the United States, once counted San Francisco as its home, but has since moved to being an entirely remote company.\n\nHarred was already a known denizen of the so-called darknet, where he went by the username \u2018winblo,\u2019 according to independent cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs. Using this identity, Harred was said to be \"extremely active\" and \"revered\" on an online marketplace where highly prized social media accounts were sold to buyers.\n\nWith some of these stolen funds, Harred purchased a BMW i8 that Krebs reported had a cost of approximately $150,000 at the time. Prosecutors said in their indictment that the two called some of their victims after seizing control of their accounts in a bid to further extort them.\n\nThe scheme came to an end in 2019 after an investigation by the FBI identified Harred and Ditman and arrested the two. The pair have yet to be sentenced.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Confirms Double Top, How Low Can BTC Drop? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Yesterday\u2019s weekly close of the Bitcoin price below the $26,000 mark has raised concerns among analysts and traders. This move could potentially signal a further decline for the leading cryptocurrency, as it appears to be the first step to confirming a double top formation on the weekly chart.\n\nRekt Capital, a prominent figure in the crypto analysis sphere, took to Twitter to share his insights, stating, \u201cBTC has officially Weekly Closed below the ~$26,000 support. Technically, BTC has begun the first step in the process of validating this Double Top formation. Turn $26,000 into new resistance and the breakdown will likely be confirmed.\u201d\n\nHow Low Can The Bitcoin Price Drop?\n\nRemarkably, this isn\u2019t the first time Rekt Capital has voiced concerns about this price level. Already on August 7, the analyst warned, \u201cIf BTC drops to $26,000 by mid-September then a Double Top may be forming. A breakdown from $26,000 would validate the Double Top.\u201d\n\nDiving deeper into potential price movements, Rekt Capital has speculated that a breach of the $26,000 base could see Bitcoin tumble towards the $22,000 region. The analyst emphasized the importance of observing the price action this week, noting, \u201cif we see a weekly close below $26,000, followed by a rejection from $26,000, then we probably see a confirmed breakdown from this double top.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all gloom and doom. Rekt Capital also highlighted the dangers of getting overly bearish, advising traders, \u201cSo it\u2019s really important not to get caught in these downside wicks (below $26,000).\u201d On a brighter note, the analyst pointed to the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Bitcoin\u2019s weekly chart which played out in mid-March this year, suggesting that a retest of its neckline, around $24,000, might indicate the bottom of Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming move.\n\nDecentrader, a crypto intelligence platform, weighed in on the current market conditions, tweeting, \u201cThe market is currently experiencing the most sustained period of #bitcoin on-chain losses since the bear market lows. Is this a buy the dip opportunity or the start of a deeper pullback?\u201d\n\nThey further highlighted potential price movements, stating, \u201cBitcoin Liquidity Map: There is a significant amount of 3x, 5x, 10x liquidity from $23,500 down to $21,600. IF price did get down to $23,500 we could see a fairly swift liquidity escalation event that could move price down fast.\u201d\n\nFinal Correction?\n\nMicha\u00ebl van de Poppe, another esteemed analyst, provided a comprehensive historical perspective. He emphasized the significance of September as a historically challenging month for Bitcoin, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s a level which #Bitcoin must hold in order to avoid a significant crash. Bitcoin is currently holding onto a significant level of support. It\u2019s around the $25,500 barrier.\u201d\n\nVan de Poppe delved into the historical and cyclical aspects of Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. He highlights that the months of August and September, especially in a pre-halving year, have traditionally been tough for Bitcoin. In August 2015, Bitcoin experienced a substantial correction towards the 200-EMA but managed to stay above it. A similar pattern was observed in August 2019, with a significant correction followed by a smaller one in November 2019.\n\nDrawing parallels between the current market cycle and that of 2015, van de Poppe suggested that given the influx of new institutional participants, the current market could be mirroring the 2015 cycle. If this correlation holds, the current downturn could be the final correction before a potential rebound.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $25,692.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nEven as he pushes to get the world past \"the fax era of global payments,\" Bitcoin bull David Marcus said he doesn't believe that BTC will ever become a popular or common payment method.\n\n\u201cOur view is actually that Bitcoin is not the currency that people will use to buy things,\" the entrepreneur said during an interview with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Monday.\n\nThe comment may seem surprising coming from Marcus, who co-founded PayPal and now serves as the CEO of Lightspark\u2014a company building on Bitcoin\u2019s lightning network. But it is on that network\u2014a layer-2 scaling solution on top of the top cryptocurrency\u2014where he is placing his bets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We're trying to turn #Bitcoin into a global payment network. There's no universal protocol for money on the internet that enables value to be transported,\" says @lightspark CEO @davidmarcus. \"Our view is $BTC is not the currency people will use to buy things.\" pic.twitter.com/3fEBTzHxJS \u2014 Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) September 11, 2023\n\nThe lightning network is intended to make Bitcoin transactions faster, cheaper, and more practical for small payments. It processes BTC transactions separately before later settling them on the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to Marcus, the company\u2019s goal is to turn lightning into a \u201cuniversal protocol for money on the internet,\u201d similar to how texting is a universal protocol for communication. However, the currencies transferred over the network would still be the fiat currencies we know and use today.\n\n\u201cA fragment of a Bitcoin on top of lightning is like a small packet data packet on the internet only for value,\u201d said Marcus. Users could send any currency they\u2019d like\u2014including dollars, yen, or euros\u2014and receive any money of choice on the other side. Lightning acts as the \u201creal-time,\u201d \u201clow cost,\u201d and \u201ccash final\u201d settlement layer in between, he explained.\n\nMarcus did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe executive\u2019s views echo that of Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, whose company also leverages lightning for cheaper global currency transfers. The wallet app now enables worldwide lightning-based remittances to 65 countries like Argentina, Nigeria, and Ghana, where users can receive transactions as local currency within their bank account.\n\nBefore working on Bitcoin, Marcus worked on Meta\u2019s now-defunct stablecoin wallet app, NOVI. Between failed partnerships and backlash from regulators, Marcus stepped down from the firm in late November 2021, saying his \u201centrepreneurial DNA\u201d was encouraging him to move on. He launched Lightspark six months later.\n\nFellow PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel also speaks well of Bitcoin, considering it an alternative to today's \u201cbankrupt\u201d central banks and \u201cfiat money regime.\"\n\nAs a company, PayPal now allows users to buy, sell, and hold crypto, including Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC). Last month, the payment platform announced its own stablecoin, PYUSD, which means to \u201ctransform payments in Web3 and digitally native environments.\u201d"

Bitcoin (BTC) trades below $26,000 again and settles around $25,800, while Ethereum (ETH) drops to $1,610.\n\nThe market's mood remains subdued. Any minimally positive news quickly makes digital assets climb, especially the reigning cryptocurrency, but they fail to break above the levels at which they have been moving and end up back in the red after a short time. Last Friday, for example, rumors that JP Morgan would be developing a blockchain-based payments system sent BTC up to $26,200, but it didn't take long for it to trade back around current levels.\n\nCraig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, believes that Bitcoin is continuing to struggle, and arguably the industry as a whole, despite the recent victory for Grayscale over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For Erlam, that the regulator extended the deadline to rule on BlackRock's and other companies' spot ETFs is a particularly frustrating but necessary hurdle.\n\n\"In the meantime, Bitcoin finds itself back around $25,000 and looking rather uninspired. Of course, as we\u2019ve seen so often in the past, that can change in a heartbeat,\" the expert added.\n\nHowever, the data does not seem to provide grounds for a rebound in digital assets barring any major headlines in the crypto space. According to CCData, spot trading in cryptocurrencies is at its lowest level since March 2019: spot trading volume on centralized crypto exchanges retreated 7.78% to $475 billion in August, while derivatives volume fell more than 12% to $1.62 trillion, the second lowest since 2021.\n\nHowever, there are positive signs going forward. ARK Invest, a manager led by Cathie Wood and a driver of BTC and ETH spot ETFs, noted in a report the increased sentiment regarding the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF. According to ARK, GBTC's net asset value (NAV) discount, which represents the difference between the market value of the fund's holdings and the market value of the fund itself, fell to the lowest levels in about a year at an 18% discount after reaching 24% last August. This discount was as high as over 40% at the peak of this year's rallies.\n\nOn the other hand, it is still unclear how the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) recent advance on several decentralized finance companies (DeFi) may affect the market.\n\n\"I believe that these rapid legal developments, which are now expanding to include many aspects related to cryptocurrencies and associated technology, will continue to shape the regulatory and legislative environment for this market, even though they may temporarily frustrate traders. However, further actions by law enforcement authorities may contribute to reducing the state of uncertainty and loss of confidence in this market in the future, with clarity on what is legal and illegal,\" explained Samer Hasn, market analyst at XS.com.\n\nIn other market news, highlights include declines of 1% for Cardano (ADA), 2% for Solana (SOL) and 3% for Ripple (XRP)."

        "content": "AN IT worker who lost \u00a3160 million in Bitcoin after his ex binned the hard drive has threatened his local council with legal action if they refuse to let him search a landfill for it.\n\nJames Howells, 38, has been battling the council for a decade to search the piles of rubbish for his treasure chest of Bitcoin, which is ex-girlfriend threw out in 2013.\n\n4 James has been refused permission to search for the iPhone sized drive repeatedly - despite offering a quarter of any fortune to the council Credit: WNS\n\n4 The council think the chances of finding the drive, which James believes is now worth around \u00a3162m, are unrealistic Credit: Getty\n\nHe has been refused permission to search for the iPhone sized drive repeatedly - despite offering a quarter of any fortune to the council.\n\nThey say the chances of finding the drive, which James believes is now worth around \u00a3162m, are unrealistic.\n\nThe IT worker has previously hired engineers, environmentalists and data recovery experts from around the world to aid in his desperate search.\n\nHe even hired NASA data experts Ontrack in 2021 - the data-recovery firm which salvaged the battered drive from the Columbia space shuttle after it plunged to Earth in 2003.\n\nJames is now turning to the threat of legal action against Newport council chiefs in an attempt to retrieve the cryptocurrency.\n\nHis legal team have slammed the council for \"ignoring Mr Howells\u2019 requests to meet\", and are asking for immediate access to the landfill.\n\nThey are threatening to sue if not given the chance, and have set the council a deadline of September 18.\n\nJames told WalesOnline: \u201cNewport City Council continues to ignore our requests for a meeting, a genuine sit-down conversation, to figure out a way forward.\n\n\"They continue to stonewall us. The only option left is legal action.\n\n\"I have three barristers [Dean Armstrong KC, Bruce Drummond and Maria Mulla] on board and we are willing to take them all the way to the High Court and Supreme Court if necessary.\u201d\n\nJames claims he has a proprietary right under law to the hard drive, and doesn't understand why the council won't engage with him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that they have not had a conversation with us about how to do this safely, without damaging the environment, at no cost to the council,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe value of the coins is still viable and will grow over time.\"\n\nJames accidentally threw out the valuable hard drive containing the Bitcoin fortune while cleaning out his office ten years ago.\n\nHis ex-girlfriend, Hafina, then took the rubbish to the tip before James realised he had made a mistake.\n\nReliving the brutal mistake, James said he doesn't blame his former partner for the innocent mistake.\n\nHe did add: \"legally, the hard drive left my house while I was asleep without my consent. Therefore it could be considered stolen property under UK law, potentially.\u201d\n\n\"But I\u2019m not giving up. I equate it to the council harbouring stolen property for ten years, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nIt's value has fluctuated over the years, with James claiming two years ago that it was worth \u00a3342 million.\n\nHe previously explained the search was expected to take 9 to 12 months and would be aided by specially employed AI technology.\n\nHe said his plan has been backed by hedge funds who are willing to stump up for the cost of the search as well as the equipment involved in exchange for the lion's share of his fortune.\n\nHe has studied aerial photographs of the site and believes the hard drive is in a 200 metre squared area and could be as deep as 15 metres under the rubbish.\n\nJames' previous plans to trawl through the tip have included robotic arms, manual pickers and factory-standard machinery.\n\nBut over the years the council has repeatedly shut down his plans for excavation, citing a variety of reasons ranging from environmental permits to the likelihood of finding his device.\n\nJames, however, thinks \"the excuses are just fluff.\"\n\n\"We have experts that can mitigate every single concern. People who deal with landfills for a living. These are not new techniques [his team are proposing] - it\u2019s just about bringing them all together.\"\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to estimate what the hard drive will be like when we get it,\" he did admit.\n\n\"We could find it and it could be cracked into a million pieces. I accept that. But we could find it and it could be stuck under something and be fine - that is just as likely. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA Council spokesperson said: \"Newport City Council has been contacted multiple times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins, which may or may not be in our landfill site.\n\n\"The council has told Mr Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit, and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area.\n\n\"The council is the only body authorised to carry out operations on the site. We have been very clear and consistent in our responses that we cannot assist Mr Howells in this matter.\n\n\"Our position has not changed. We will be offering no further comments on this issue as it takes up valuable officer time which could be spent on delivering services for the residents of Newport.\"\n\n4 While he accepts the drive may be damaged beyond repair, he is insistent on searching for it anyway Credit: WNS\n\n4 A council spokesperson had said their position \"will not change\" Credit: WNS\n\nINVESTMENT WARNING\n\nBuying any cryptocurrency is incredibly risky.\n\nWith any investment, there is a risk that the value of your money could go down as well as up. That means you should only invest money you can afford to lose.\n\nCrypto can be riskier than other investments because they are volatile and speculative - their price often rising and falls very quickly, sometimes seemingly for not reason.\n\nMany cryptocurrencies have a short track record, making them difficult to understand and predict.\n\nThis type of investment is also not protected by the regulator which means you have no protection if things go wrong.\n\nThe UK regulator has warned that Brits risk losing ALL of their money if they invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf you are considering investing in any type of crypto, do your research first and only invest money you can afford to lose.\n\nBe wary of scams, too, as the crypto market is often a target for fraud.\n\nLook out for fake celebrity endorsements or social media profiles pushing certain coins."

        "title": "eToro: the latest news and a future price forecasting for Bitcoin - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article, we look at what are the latest market news for Bitcoin and a future price forecasting, according to investment broker eToro.\n\nAt the center of the discussions we find an issue related to cryptocurrency mining, which is increasingly becoming an incentive for energy sustainability, with a rare event in which a user paid 19 BTC, or about $500,000, as a fee on the crypto network.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s look at a price analysis and a forecasting of Bitcoin\u2019s future trend: are we close to the long-awaited bull market?\n\nAll the details below.\n\neToro and the latest market news for Bitcoin: mining boosts energy sustainability\n\nThe latest crypto news offered by eToro is primarily about an affair that has to do with Bitcoin mining and its predisposition to incentivize the use of renewable energy.\n\nLast week, one of Texas\u2019 leading computing power providers, Riot Blockchain, released its August results, revealing that it received a $32 million economic incentive for reducing its power consumption during peak hours when the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) struggles to support high demand.\n\nThis strategy is called \u201cdemand response\u201d and is precisely based on the voluntary decision by large industries to halt energy demand during the hottest hours so that the power grid can maintain its stability while avoiding heavy blackouts.\n\nAs a reward, ERCOT gave Riot a reward of $32 million in energy credits, which is a significant income compared to the mining company\u2019s monthly revenues.\n\nCompared to July, Riot managed to mine fewer BTC in August due to reduced energy consumption, while counting a significant increase in \u201cPower credits\u201d and \u201cDemand Response Credits.\u201d\n\nIn detail, counting a reduction in revenue from BTC sales of $3.5 million, we can observe an increase in economic incentives of $23.8 million.\n\nWhat happened with the mining company in August is proof that this sector can somehow incentivize energy sustainability by improving the operation of power grids.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin miners can be a release valve for renewable energy by allowing for a steady economic return, enabling them to partially abate the costs associated with building and maintaining photovoltaic panels and wind turbines.\n\nOf note in this regard is how in the United Kingdom last week there was a failure of a wind auction due to the associated uneconomic costs.\n\nDigital gold mining could in this sense offer an unconventional solution to support the development of renewable energy by contributing economically to its sustenance\n\nA massive $500,000 fee for a cryptocurrency network user\n\nAnother news report from eToro concerns a curious affair involving a Bitcoin whale and a whopping $500,000 fee paid for a single transaction.\n\nIndeed, looking at the data from \u201cMempool.space\u201d we can see how in block 807057 the total fees for miners amount to 20.013 BTC, much higher than those recorded in the previous block, where we see a total of 0.178 BTC.\n\nThe address bc1qr35hws365juz5rtlsjtvmulu97957kqvr3zpw3 is responsible for this anomaly since it paid a whopping 1,982,108,632 sat (about 19 BTC), equivalent to $510,770 to execute a single transaction on Saturday, September 9 at 7:10 PM (CET).\n\nThis is the largest commission paid to date within the Bitcoin network.\n\nUsually a user may decide to pay multiple fees to get priority confirmation of his tx, however in this case the order of magnitude seems so exaggerated as to suggest a typing error.\n\nOn average it costs about $2 to perform a transaction in Bitcoin according to current data.\n\nIn May, under the wave of Fomo ushered in with the advent of Ordinals, average fees came to cost about $30, an exaggerated value but extremely far from the half-million dollar figure.\n\nIn any case, looking at the address in question we can see a balance of more than 400 BTC, equal to more than $10 million, and a considerable amount of transactions that were executed after the one related to the huge fee.\n\nThus, the mishap has not hindered the whale, which while recording a painful mistake does not seem to have gone down, continuing its operations at a high pace.\n\nFuture price forecasting for Bitcoin by eToro: the week of truth?\n\nAfter reporting the news reported by the broker eToro, let\u2019s look at a future price forecast for Bitcoin. We are in a very important week that may decree the price action in the coming months until the end of the year.\n\nAt the moment BTC is at around $25,720, poised between a possible bullish restart and a tremendous bearish shakeout.\n\nPrices have been stagnating at this level now since 19 August giving signs that signal a likely descent ahead.\n\nThe only bullish attempt dated 19 August, on the news that Grayscale had won a very important lawsuit against the SEC, was promptly absorbed by the next two candles that erased all previous gains.\n\nMoreover, the directionality of the short trend is blatantly bearish with the asset holding firm below the EMA 10 and EMA 50.\n\nA break of the $25,000 would take us straight to $23,000 and then to $20,000, where major support is located.\n\nCountering the bears\u2019 assumptions is the RSI indicator, which shows us an interesting bullish divergence on a daily time frame: while in fact prices have been going sideways since mid-August, the RSI is rising and could lead prices to a pump in the coming days.\n\nAs such, a quick recovery of $28,000 and then $30,000 could invalidate bear theories and bring bulls back into the market.\n\nHowever, the outlook between now and the next few weeks remains negative, and it seems that we should wait until next year before an actual return to the bull market.\n\n2024 could be the year for us to be able to find Bitcoin at its all-time highs again, given the coincidence with the halving, which usually prompts the cryptocurrency to increase its price significantly in anticipation of reduced supply in the markets.\n\nHang on holders, it can\u2019t rain forever."

        "title": "Bitcoin price prediction as BTC adds over 700,000 new addresses in a day - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "In a turbulent turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC) has persisted on a downward trajectory in recent weeks despite a fleeting surge that saw its value briefly breach the $28,000 mark at the close of August.\n\nThis bearish trend has unfolded against a backdrop of mounting market uncertainty fueled by postponed spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the strengthening of the US dollar, and most recently, fears about a potential $3.4 billion liquidation of FTX\u2019s recovered user assets.\n\nHowever, while its price performance remains subdued, the same cannot be said for Bitcoin\u2019s network activity. In fact, the largest cryptocurrency in the world recently witnessed the sharpest gain in new daily addresses in 5 years, crypto market expert Ali Martinez highlighted on September 10.\n\nAccording to Martinez, \u201ca whopping 717,331 new BTC addresses\u201d were created on Saturday, September 9, the most since December 14, 2017, when Bitcoin added over 800,000 fresh addresses in a day.\n\n\u201cOnly once before, on December 14, 2017, did we see a larger surge with 800,180 new BTC addresses. History in the making!\u201d \u2013 Martinez wrote in the tweet.\n\nBTC daily new addresses. Source: Ali Martinez\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was sitting at $25,727, down 0.37% in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe maiden crypto asset lost less than 1% over the past week and more than 12% on the month, erasing around $72 billion off its market cap over that 30-day period.\n\nBTC 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nStill, Bitcoin remains up about 55% in 2023, outperforming major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Binance Coin (BNB).\n\nThe recent surge in new Bitcoin addresses hints at a growing influx of new investors eager to seize the opportunity presented by the latest price dip, strategically accumulating BTC holdings. This influx likely suggests that interest in Bitcoin remains strong as individuals seek to capitalize on its long-term potential despite short-term market underperformance.\n\nOn the other hand, there is also a possibility that BTC could continue to witness bearish pressure in the near future, as highlighted by an analysis posted on TradingView last week.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin\u2019s technical indicators are pointing out pessimistic signs, particularly the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Stochastic Oscillator.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
