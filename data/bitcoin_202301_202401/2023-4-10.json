        "title": "Bitcoin price rises above $30,000 for first time since June 2022 - The Guardian",
        "content": "A sharp rise in bitcoin prices has pushed the cryptocurrency above $30,000 (\u00a324,118) for the first time since 10 June last year, just before the Celsius crypto lending company froze withdrawals in the run-up to its collapse.\n\nEven given that recovery, the token is still well below its all-time high of $68,000 in November 2021, and far below where it was before the failure of the Terra stablecoin caused the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, bitcoin\u2019s recent steady increase in value has sparked discussion of another cryptocurrency boom \u2013 and reignited fears of widespread manipulation in the market.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month and the broader contagion it has sparked across financial markets led some cryptocurrency fans to turn to bitcoin, the original and most valuable token in the sector, as a way of protecting against fears that the entire traditional \u201cfiat\u201d economy would crumble.\n\nThat attitude was typified by the US venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan, who in March bet $1m that the price of a single bitcoin would top $1m by June this year. His claim was that the US dollar would shortly experience hyperinflation, causing the dollar value of a bitcoin to soar.\n\nQ&A What is bitcoin? Show Bitcoin is a 'cryptocurrency' \u2013 a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Invented in 2008, you store your bitcoins in a digital wallet, and transactions are stored in a public ledger known as the bitcoin blockchain, which prevents the digital currency being double-spent. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, with some deeming it a risky investment. In January 2021 the UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned consumers they should be prepared to lose all their money if they invest in schemes promising high returns from digital currencies such as bitcoin. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. In November 2021 it hit a record high of more than $68,000, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis. Bitcoin has been criticised for the vast energy reserves and associated carbon footprint of the system. New bitcoins are created by \u201cmining\u201d coins, which is done by using computers to carry out complex calculations. The more bitcoins that have been \"mined\", the longer it takes to mine new coin, and the more electricity is used in the process. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment that the world redenominates on bitcoin as digital gold, returning to a model much like before the 20th century,\u201d he tweeted, explaining the bet. \u201cEverything will happen very fast once people check what I\u2019m saying and see that the Federal Reserve has lied about how much money there is in the banks. All dollar holders get destroyed.\u201d\n\nAlex Adelman, the chief executive of the bitcoin rewards app Lolli, said Monday\u2019s rally \u201cdid not have a clear catalyst\u201d, but that it was \u201ca bellwether of bitcoin\u2019s newly bullish market conditions and strong investor confidence. Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing strength suggests that bitcoin is emerging from so-called \u2018crypto winter\u2019 into a new phase of strength and renewed interest from retail and institutional investors.\u201d\n\nBut the recovery, after bitcoin prices hovered at $28,000 for almost a month before leaping the final $2,000 in a day, has also led to concern about market manipulation.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Show A stablecoin, like the name suggests, is a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as US$1 per token. How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price.\n\nOthers, known as \"algorithmic stablecoins\", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don't collapse.\n\nStablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nA 2022 report published by the US National Bureau of Economic Research found that \u201cwash trading\u201d, the practice of selling cryptocurrencies between related parties to influence the reported price, averaged \u201cover 70% of the reported volume\u201d on 29 unregulated exchanges.\n\nIn June 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) refused permission to launch a bitcoin-linked exchange traded fund, which would allow investors to buy exposure to the cryptocurrency on the public stock markets, after concluding that it was impossible to prevent fraud and manipulation in the market from affecting the price.\n\nAs well as wash trading, the SEC said the market could be influenced by individuals with a \u201cdominant position\u201d in bitcoin manipulating its pricing, through fraud and manipulation at trading platforms, and through manipulative activity involving stablecoins \u201cincluding tether\u201d."

        "content": "Bitcoin is still the market\u2019s runaway success story of the year. The cryptocurrency topped $30,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June.\n\nBitcoin has gained more than 80 percent in price this year, far outperforming many other assets. The Nasdaq 100, an index of the biggest tech stocks, has gained roughly 20 percent in that period \u2014 a strong showing but a far cry from Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence.\n\nThe latest Bitcoin rally appears to be partly tied to the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, which has included nine interest rate increases over the past year. Crypto asset prices sank a year ago as the central bank began to raise rates, but investors are now betting that the Fed will soon pause its rate increases, even though Fed officials have been suggesting the opposite, setting off a big rebound.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s biggest gains also coincide with the turmoil in the banking sector. The cryptocurrency is up more than 45 percent since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month. Industry advocates point to the recent rally as a sign that investors are converting some of their cash into digital currencies, though there is little evidence of that happening."

        "content": "Bitcoin is trading above the $30,200 mark! The leader of the crypto market on Tuesday set a new price high for the year 2023. Notably, Bitcoin touched the psychological mark of $30,000 for the first time since June last year. The current year has been fruitful for the crypto as it has gained nearly 84% so far, making Bitcoin top-performing asset in the respective market in Q1 of 2023. The latest sharp rally does indicate a growing interest in cryptocurrencies among Indian investors.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin traded at $30,244.20 -- up by 6.15%. The crypto has touched an intraday high of $30,293.32 --- which is also the 30-day high level.\n\nIt is also the top trending cryptocurrency on Tuesday. Bitcoin's dominance surged by 0.83% to 47.15% in the market compared to the previous day, as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin has gained by nearly 8% in seven trading sessions.\n\nRahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay on Bitcoin said, \"Bitcoin has been on an upward trajectory since the beginning of 2023. On Jan 1st, Bitcoin began trading at roughly $16,500. As of 11th April, the asset has been trading above the $30,000 mark which is close to an 80% gain since Jan 2023. This is the first time since June 2022, that Bitcoin has reached this level. If the asset sustains above the key psychological resistance level of $30,000 we might see the price rise further.\"\n\nWhile CoinDCX Research revealed that Bitcoin has surpassed the $30,000 level for the first time since June 2022, setting a new price high for 2023. In the last 30 days, Bitcoin has seen significant gains of almost 50%, reaching its highest level in 10 months on 11th April 2023.\n\nAs per CoinDCX, the rise can be attributed to various factors such as growing inflation in the US, banking sector instability, and uncertainty surrounding stablecoin. Many investors are betting against the declining value of the US dollar and investing in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.\n\nBitcoin has been the top-performing asset class for Q1 2023, recording a gain of nearly 70%.\n\nThis has led to a surge in institutional adoption, with big players like MicroStrategy accumulating around 1,40,000 Bitcoins, one of the largest corporate holders as on date. Additionally, CoinDCX Research explained that the narrative around the next Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 2024, is also starting to pick up, which has historically been a bullish signal for Bitcoin and crypto markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch said, \"As the US economy faces an increasing probability of a \u201chard landing\", while high interest rates continue to add fuel to the banking crisis, investors are turning to safer asset classes, like Gold. Despite the banking challenges being faced by crypto companies in the US, the surge in Bitcoin prices persists and it is truly \u201cdecoupling\" from traditional finance.\"\n\nAdditionally, if looked at BTC\u2019s historical price cycles, Chaturvedi said, \"we are almost a year away from the next halving of rewards, which typically marks the start of a bull run lasting for at least a year post-halving. Increasing prices are usually coupled with an increase in trading volumes. Hence, it could be said that investors are warming up to Bitcoin. We can expect further growth in its prices.\"\n\nGoing ahead, Pagidipati said, \"irrespective of the near-time price gains and falls, we believe Bitcoin is a fundamentally strong asset with remarkable potential in the long run.\"\n\nBut Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX points out that despite Bitcoin crossing $30,000 for the first time since June 2022, \"there has been no spike in volumes at WazirX and most trading volumes have been rangebound.\"\n\nMenon revealed that while there is muted celebration, most traders still believe that the market is in the middle of a bear run.\n\nAs per WazirX VP, as the crypto-world braces itself for the next Bitcoin halving, estimated to occur around May 4, 2024, when Bitcoin reaches 840,000 blocks, traders are bracing themselves for a period of mini-bull runs and potential drawdowns. This halving event marks the fourth protocol-designed 50% reduction in block rewards, which happens every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years.\n\nThat being said, Menon mentioned \"the upcoming halving is poised to reduce the rate at which new Bitcoin is created, resulting in a lower available supply and increased scarcity. This could lead to higher demand and, as a result, a potential surge in Bitcoin's price. The implications of such a significant event have many speculating and watching the markets with bated breath.\"\n\nInvestors should keep a track of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for March which comes on April 12 and will also provide key insight into the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation, further affecting the crypto market.\n\nZebPay CEO said, \"This week\u2019s US Consumer Price Index(CPI) data could potentially impact this trend further. If the CPI data encourages the Fed to pause interest rate hikes, it can bolster the price of Bitcoin.\"\n\nHow Bitcoin performs ahead will be watched keenly. But for now, the $30,000 mark is said as positive development for Indian crypto markets.\n\nPunit Agarwal, Founder of KoinX, a crypto taxation platform, said, \"The recent news of Bitcoin reaching the 30,000 dollar mark for the first time since 2022 is a positive development for the Indian cryptocurrency market.\" In his view, this indicates a rising interest in cryptocurrencies among investors in India, which could lead to more investment opportunities in the crypto space and Web 3 space on the whole.\n\nLastly, Agarwal concluded in regards to domestic crypto market, \"as cryptocurrencies gain more mainstream acceptance with the new upcoming regulations, they could contribute to the overall growth of India's digital economy, providing benefits such as faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, increased financial inclusion, and more innovation in the financial sector. The potential benefits of cryptocurrencies make it an exciting space for investors and businesses alike.\"\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) crossed $30,000 Tuesday, reaching the highest level for the world's largest cryptocurrency in 10 months.\n\nIt briefly touched $30,301 around 2:20 AM ET Tuesday before easing later in the morning. By 8:00 AM ET, bitcoin was changing hands at $30,027, up 6.2% for the last 24 hours. The last time the digital currency was this high was June 6, 2022.\n\nThe bitcoin rally buoyed other crypto assets and companies Tuesday, including the stock of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) and the price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH-USD), as well as the stocks of bitcoin mining companies Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot (RIOT).\n\nBitcoin still has a ways to go to reach the heights it scaled during its peak. It still trades 23% below where it stood one year ago.\n\nThe rapid climb of digital currencies is one of this year's big surprises in markets after a crash in 2022 that cost investors billions as higher interest rates and inflation lowered the value and appeal of risky assets. Several crypto players filed for bankruptcy, including FTX in November. FTX's former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried now faces criminal charges that he stole billions of FTX customer funds and misled investors.\n\n\"It's a bounce back from the really poor performance we saw in 2022,\" VettaFi research head Todd Rosenbluth told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWhat gave the market added momentum this year was a banking crisis in March that took down three lenders, including two that specifically served cryptocurrency customers.\n\nSince March 10, the day regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank in the second-largest bank failure of U.S. history, bitcoin has climbed $9,500 higher for a more than 30% rise. Ether (ETH-USD) is up more than 29%. According to Coinmarketcap, the total value for all crypto assets is up more than 24% during that period, as of Tuesday at 8:00 a.m. ET.\n\nSome investors chose to seek out bitcoin as a safe haven from the perceived instability of banking. Others anticipated the Fed might have to cut interest rates in response to the crisis, sparking more flows into alternative risk assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the banking crisis also has significantly restrained liquidity in the crypto market according to data collected from Kaiko Research. Because investors now have less banking partners to assist in moving funds from dollars to cryptocurrencies and vice versa, analysts have argued it is much easier to manipulate bitcoin\u2019s price with a large order.\n\nCrypto\u2019s 2023 comeback unfolds even as Washington regulators step up their efforts to rein in the market.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has issued 11 enforcement actions since the beginning of January against crypto firms and individuals, while serving formal letters to Paxos, DeFi exchange Sushi, and Coinbase Global warning the agency plans to bring an enforcement action. Coinbase is the largest U.S. crypto exchange.\n\nCoinbase shares have rebounded 86% year to date but are still suppressed by two thirds below their value a year ago. Marathon Digital and Riot have both more than doubled since the beginning of 2023 but still trade 60% and 45% below their price a year ago.\n\nAnother regulator, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, also has sued crypto exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao for allegedly selling derivatives backed by digital assets to U.S. customers despite not being registered to do so.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "Bitcoin mines in the US have had a tremendous impact on power grids, a New York Times investigation reveals. The mines \u2014 which are giant data farms \u2014 use vastly more electricity than the communities surrounding them, driving up pollution from coal and gas power plants. The crypto mines also make electricity bills more expensive for their neighbors, even as the companies profit off incentives that grid operators offer to prevent blackouts during an energy crunch.\n\nThis is the most comprehensive analysis yet of Bitcoin\u2019s impact on the environment and energy system in the US. And it comes as Democratic lawmakers press federal agencies to require crypto companies to divulge information about their operations. The Times has startling numbers for individual crypto mines and the industry as a whole, which it got by pouring over financial records, satellite imagery, and studies it commissioned from outside research groups.\n\nThe newspaper identified 34 of the biggest crypto mines in the US, each operating at 40 megawatts or higher. Every single one of them, on its own, uses at least 30,000 times as much electricity as the average home in America. In Rockdale, Texas, the largest and most energy-hungry Bitcoin mining facility in the country burns through as much electricity as the closest 300,000 homes combined.\n\nIn Rockdale, Texas, the largest and most energy-hungry Bitcoin mining facility in the country burns through as much electricity as the closest 300,000 homes combined\n\nThe industry\u2019s expansion in the US has been swift, another stressor for US power grids. The US only became the world\u2019s biggest hub for Bitcoin miners after China kicked them out in 2021. The Times compares the new power demand coming from American crypto mines to suddenly adding another \u201cNew York City\u2019s worth of residences.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is a purposely energy-demanding blockchain. To validate transactions and generate new tokens, Bitcoin \u201cminers\u201d use specialized hardware to solve mathematical puzzles. The amount of energy needed to solve those puzzles is supposed to dissuade bad actors from messing with the ledger. The puzzles get increasingly complex with time as more people try to solve them, requiring more sophisticated software that eats up more electricity in the process.\n\nPollution stemming from the added energy demand of Bitcoin mines is about as much as the annual emissions from 3.5 million new gas-guzzling cars, the Times reports. Promises from the industry that Bitcoin mines would spur renewable energy growth haven\u2019t panned out. Coal and gas plants meet about 85 percent of the demand Bitcoin mining adds to power grids, according to an analysis the Times commissioned from the nonprofit Watttime.\n\nOn top of making pollution worse, crypto mines also affect Americans\u2019 energy bills. Skyrocketing demand raises electricity prices and forces nearby households to compete for limited supply. The energy consumption has raised other customers\u2019 electricity bills by almost 5 percent in Texas, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis commissioned by the Times. That amounts to $1.8 billion per year in higher electricity costs for consumers across Texas, which is home to about a third of the crypto mines scrutinized.\n\nWhile they drive other people\u2019s bills up, crypto companies have managed to game energy systems in their favor. The company operating the Bitcoin mine in Rockdale, Texas, paid just 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour last year, it reported to investors. That\u2019s compared to 13.5 cents residential customers typically paid that year.\n\nHow does a crypto mine get electricity for so cheap? In Texas, it can benefit from a program that pays industrial businesses to power down when the grid is under too much pressure. This happened in February 2021 when a severe cold snap disrupted energy supply \u2014 leaving millions of residents without power and ultimately killing hundreds of people. During the disaster, the state power grid operator paid one crypto mining company an average of $175,000 an hour to power down its computers. In 2020, five mines made at least $60 million from that energy-saving program, the Times reports."

        "title": "75% of those who've heard of crypto aren't confident in its safety, reliability - Pew Research Center",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets are taking hits from all sides \u2013 from declines in value to multiple corporate bankruptcies to lawsuits and regulatory threats. Among the vast majority of Americans who say they have heard at least a little about cryptocurrency (88%), three-quarters say they are not confident that current ways to invest in, trade or use cryptocurrencies are reliable and safe, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted March 13-19. This comes out to about two-thirds of all U.S. adults.\n\nRoughly four-in-ten adults who have heard about cryptocurrency (39%) say they are not at all confident and an additional 36% are not very confident in the reliability and safety of cryptocurrencies. On the other end of the spectrum, few of these adults are extremely (2%) or very (4%) confident in cryptocurrencies. About one-in-five (18%) say they are somewhat confident.\n\nWhile concern about cryptocurrency is broad, some groups of Americans are more concerned than others. For instance, adults ages 50 and older who have heard about cryptocurrency are more likely than their younger counterparts to say they are not confident in its reliability and safety (85% vs. 66%).\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to examine Americans\u2019 views of and personal experiences with cryptocurrency. This survey was conducted among 10,701 U.S. adults from March 13-19, 2023. Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology. This survey includes a total sample size of 375 Asian adults. The sample primarily includes English-speaking Asian Americans and therefore may not be representative of the overall Asian adult population. Despite this limitation, Asian adults\u2019 responses are incorporated into the general population figures throughout this report.\n\nWomen are also slightly more skeptical of investing in, trading or using cryptocurrencies. Among Americans who have heard about cryptocurrency, 80% of women say they are not confident in it, compared with 71% of men.\n\nAttitudes also differ based on whether someone has invested in cryptocurrency. While one-in-five cryptocurrency users say they are extremely or very confident that it is safe and reliable, that share drops to 2% among those who are familiar with cryptocurrency but have not invested. Still, many who have invested in cryptocurrency also have concerns about its security: 43% of this group say they are not very or not at all confident in it.\n\nWho uses cryptocurrency in the U.S.?\n\nOverall, 17% of U.S. adults say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency. This share is mostly unchanged from previous Center surveys conducted in 2021 and 2022.\n\nAs was true in past surveys, younger men are more likely to use cryptocurrency compared with men 50 and older and women of any age. For example, 41% of men ages 18 to 29 say they have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, compared with 16% of women in the same age range.\n\nCryptocurrency use also differs by race, ethnicity and income level. Some 24% of Asian adults and 21% of Black or Hispanic adults say they have ever invested in or used a cryptocurrency, compared with 14% of White adults.\n\nAbout one-in-five adults with upper (22%) or middle (19%) incomes have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, compared with 13% of those with lower incomes.\n\nFew cryptocurrency users first used it within the past year\n\nThe survey also asked Americans when they first used cryptocurrency. Roughly three-quarters of those who have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency (74%) say they did so for the first time one to five years ago. Much smaller shares say they first did this within the past year (16%) or more than five years ago (10%).\n\nThere are differences by race, ethnicity and household income among newer cryptocurrency investors. Black users (27%) are more likely than White users (12%) to say they first used cryptocurrency within the past year. Roughly two-in-ten Hispanic users (21%) say the same. (There were not enough Asian American cryptocurrency users to be broken out into a separate analysis.) And about three-in-ten users from lower-income households report first investing in cryptocurrency within the past year, compared with about one-in-ten adults from middle- or upper-income households.\n\nSome past cryptocurrency users no longer have it today\n\nRoughly three-in-ten adults (31%) who have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency say they currently do not have any cryptocurrency. Still, a majority (69%) say they do currently have cryptocurrency.\n\nThose who live in lower-income households (43%) are more likely than those in middle- (30%) or upper-income (21%) households to have given up cryptocurrency. And women who have ever used cryptocurrency are more likely than men in this same group to say they currently do not have any of the currency (37% vs. 29%).\n\nRoughly one-in-five cryptocurrency users say the investments have hurt their personal finances at least a little\n\nA plurality of cryptocurrency users (45%) report that their investments have performed worse than they expected, a result that is statistically unchanged since July 2022, when the Center last asked about this. In comparison, 15% say their investments have done better than expected, 32% say they have done about the same as expected and 7% are unsure.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the impact these investments have had on users\u2019 personal finances, three-in-five users (60%) say that they have neither helped nor hurt. Roughly equal shares say that these investments have helped (20%) or hurt (19%) their finances. Just 7% say that cryptocurrency has helped their finances a lot and 3% say that it has hurt a lot. \u00ad\n\nCollege graduates (25%) and those with some college experience (20%) are more likely than those with a high school education or less (10%) to say that their cryptocurrency investments hurt their personal finances.\n\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology."

        "content": "Bank of America and Fidelity have been significant owners of MicroStrategy shares in recent months, suggesting continued institutional interest in indirect bitcoin exposures.\n\nBitcoin volatility has tapered off in recent weeks as crypto traders weigh the asset\u2019s substantial bounceback in 2023 from last year\u2019s lows.\n\nBank of America in a recent SEC disclosure was showing 86,147 MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares owned by one or more of the bank\u2019s investment entities. Banks typically purchase stocks in these cases on behalf of clients and investors in active or passive strategies run out of an asset management arm\n\nFidelity, according to an SEC filing tracking stock purchases through year end 2022, snapped up 97,199 MSTR shares.\n\nBoth regulatory filings are not necessarily indicative of overall holdings for either company.\n\nShares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) have closely tracked the price of Bitcoin since the company began holding the digital currency as a reserve on its balance sheet. And scores of traders still view the stock as one of the closest publicly traded proxies for spot bitcoin exposures.\n\nBTC vs MSTR 2 year / Yahoo Finance\n\nYouwei Yang, chief economist at Bit Mining, told Blockworks in an interview that MicroStrategy continues to be known as the \u201ctop choice\u201d for obtaining indirect bitcoin exposure via public and regulated markets.\n\nPlus, bitcoin has been on the upswing for the last three to four months, Yang said, making it a no-brainer for traders to hop on MicroStrategy shares and other bitcoin exposed assets.\n\n\u201cStarting [in] early January, the coins have been climbing quite a bit and it\u2019s [natural] for a trader, whether small or large, to jump in to [buy] any exposure related to crypto or bitcoin,\u201d Yang said.\n\nThe SEC disclosures come as MicroStrategy has continued its long time corporate strategy of adding more and more bitcoin to its portfolio. Founder Michael Saylor\u2019s business intelligence company owned 140,000 bitcoins (BTC) through April 4.\n\nMicroStrategy has maintained its accumulation even as crypto markets have been rattled by escalating US enforcement actions by the SEC and the CFTC. Saylor last year stepped down from his chief executive seat and has since been accused of tax evasion.\n\nThe US publicly traded company hasn\u2019t been deterred \u2014 despite posting a net loss of $250 million in the fourth quarter on its BTC holdings.\n\nOn a fourth quarter earnings call in February, MicroStrategy Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang said that \u201cour corporate strategy and conviction in acquiring, holding and growing our bitcoin position for the long term remains unchanged.\u201d\n\nIndustry participants, including crypto hedge funds and family offices, have been eyeing MicroStrategy\u2019s latest market moves as traders parse unsteady macro conditions.\n\nUpdated April 12, 2023 at 6:59 pm ET: Corrects the disclosed duration of Fidelity\u2019s MicroStrategy stocks holdings to year end 2022.

        "title": "Bitcoin vs. Gold: Here's What the Founder of the World's Largest Hedge Fund Would Choose - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin and gold surged in March after Silicon Valley Bank led a string of bank failures and liquidity crises. Few analysts were surprised by these price movements as both are used to circumvent banks and other centralized financial institutions. The question is, which one is a better choice in the current economic climate?\n\nRay Dalio, the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has weighed in on the great Bitcoin vs. gold or digital gold vs. real gold debate. Few were surprised to hear his opinion as he is well known for his bullish stance on gold. In an interview with Maria Bartiromo at Fox Business, Dalio expressed that he much prefers gold over Bitcoin, even though he said that he holds a small amount of Bitcoin.\n\nDalio has soured further on Bitcoin since the interview, saying that Bitcoin \u201chas no relation to anything\u201d and that it receives disproportionate attention. Dalio believes that Bitcoin's status as a form of digital gold is still unproven, citing concerns that it\u2019s too volatile to be money or a store of value. He acknowledges the potential of blockchain tech; he just doesn\u2019t think Bitcoin will be the one to win out.\n\nIn contrast, gold is stable because it has been a reliable store of value and medium of exchange for thousands of years. Its stability, scarcity and inherent value make it a trusted asset for preserving wealth.\n\nDalio has emphasized that he is not opposed to cryptocurrencies in general but remains skeptical of their ability to replace gold. He has previously stated that he owns \"some Bitcoin,\" but his personal investments in the digital asset have been limited compared to his holdings in gold.\n\nOne of the main arguments against Bitcoin as a store of value is its volatility. Although the digital asset has seen a meteoric rise in value over the past decade, it has also experienced significant price fluctuations. In contrast, gold's price has remained relatively stable, providing investors with a more secure option for preserving their wealth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother concern Dalio has raised is the possibility of government intervention in the cryptocurrency market. In a recent podcast, he warned that \u201cin history, they\u2019ve outlawed gold and they\u2019ve outlawed silver and so on, and they could outlaw Bitcoin.\u201d He isn\u2019t the only one who expects world governments to try to shut down a currency they have no control over before it supplants their own.\n\nAs governments around the world start to pay closer attention to digital assets, there is a growing risk of regulatory crackdowns that could impact Bitcoin's value and adoption. Gold, on the other hand, is less likely to face such intervention because it\u2019s a physical asset, it already plays a large role in the global economy and would be extremely difficult to ban. It can also provide unique exposure to things like volatility and fear in the markets, making it a popular tool for diversification and hedging.\n\nInvestors are turning to gold and silver in droves to protect their portfolios as uncertainty rises in the economy.

        "content": "Industrial-scale bitcoin mining facilities in the US create as much carbon pollution as 3.5 million gas-powered cars, and Texas, which boasts the largest number of mining facilities in the country, will see the cost of electricity rise nearly 5% by mid-2023 due to cryptocurrency mining.\n\n\n\nThose stunning figures come from analyses by tech nonprofit WattTime and energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie for a New York Times investigation into the rise of large-scale bitcoin mining in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin miners operate large arrays of computers that are paid fees to solve the cryptological problems that allow the currency to maintain a decentralized database of all its transactions. The investigation found 34 mining operations, each drawing more than 40 megawatts of electricity; many of them were started in the US after China banned the activity there in 2021, partly due to concerns over power usage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, many of the mines were able to profit from agreements with electrical grids to pause their operations during emergencies. Systems to reward large electricity users that commit to shutting down when the grid is strained, whether they actually do or not, predate the bitcoin miners, but participating in them added tens of millions of dollars to their aggregate bottom lines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs bitcoin too big for Texas?\n\nTexas, which governor Gregg Abbott wants to be a \u201ccrypto leader,\u201d has seen major stress on its grid in recent years, particularly rolling blackouts in February 2021 and a failure in 2022 that left 70,000 people without power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe additional load created by the miners, equal to tens of thousands of new homes, as well as their participation in incentive programs, increased the cost of electricity by nearly 5% across the state and by as much as 9% in some West Texas communities.\n\nRiot Platforms, the largest miner discussed in the New York Times story, said it paid 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity in Texas in 2022. Other industrial power users in the state paid 7.2 cents, while residents paid 13.5 cents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin proponents say that other industries aren\u2019t judged on their electricity usage, and that they don\u2019t have a say in how the power they buy is generated. But grid experts say their constant demand for power makes bitcoin mines more reliant on plants that burn fossil fuel.\n\n\n\nThe other question is whether their benefits match the costs: While most forms of power usage offer some obvious added value, the jury is still out on what kind of advantages bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer society besides an opportunity for speculation.\n\nUnlike other industrial power users, which typically generate jobs and products, bitcoin mines employ few people, and the gains from the currency largely accumulate for insiders. The price of a bitcoin has risen 76% this year to nearly $30,000, but it is still more than 50% off its peak value in 2021 after the collapse of FTX and disillusionment with the idea of \u201cWeb3.\u201d"

        "content": "The New York Times has revealed the real cost of the digital race for Bitcoin. The news outlet identified 34 large-scale Bitcoin mines in the United States that each put immense pressure on the power grid, and profit from doing so.\n\nAfter Winter Storm Uri knocked out power plants across the state of Texas, tens of thousands of homes were left in darkness. By the end of February 14, 2021, nearly 40 people had died. At the same time, just outside Austin, computers were using enough electricity to power roughly 6,500 homes as they raced to earn Bitcoin.\n\nPerforming trillions of calculations a second, the computers kept running until just after midnight, when the state\u2019s power grid operator ordered them to shut off. Over the next four days, Bitcoin company Bitdeer made more than $18 million for not operating. In return for keeping its computers offline, the state paid Bitdeer an average of $175,000 an hour.\n\nFor a business to profit from Bitcoin mining, it can require as much electricity as a small city. A computer guesses an elusive combination of numbers that Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm will accept about every ten minutes, winning enough Bitcoin to be worth (at current prices) $170,000. The operations of these companies can create costs including higher electricity bills and carbon pollution, that impact everyone around them.\n\nChina, which was the site of most Bitcoin mining until June 2021, drove out Bitcoin operations citing their power use, among other reasons. The amount of electricity that Bitcoin mines are using in America, which soon became the industry\u2019s global leader, and its effect on energy markets and the environment have been unclear.\n\nEach of the 34 Bitcoin mining operations identified by the Times uses at least 30,000 times as much power as the average US home, consuming a collective total of 3,900 megawatts of electricity. According to the publication, it\u2019s as though another New York City\u2019s worth of homes were draining the nation\u2019s power supply.\n\nThe Mawson Infrastructure Group mine in Midland, Penn., uses more than twice the power of the nearby Pittsburgh airport.\n\nThe additional power use in America causes as much carbon pollution as adding 3.5 million gas-powered cars to the country\u2019s roads, according to WattTime. Bitcoin operations tend to market themselves as environmentally friendly, setting up in areas rich with renewable energy. Ultimately, their power needs are too great to be satisfied by these sources alone.\n\nWattTime found that coal and natural gas plants meet 85% of the demand that Bitcoin operations add to their grids. In Texas, where 10 of the 34 mines are connected to the state\u2019s grid, the increased demand has raised electricity bills for power customers by 5%.\n\nCan Bitcoin operations\u2019 power use be compared to hospitals?\n\nIn interviews and statements heard by the Times, many Bitcoin companies argue that they are no different from other large power users, like hospitals and factories, except for their willingness to shut off quickly to benefit the grid. Even though hospitals arguably have enough human benefit to warrant use of large amounts of power, there would be severe consequences if they reduced their power usage as routinely or dramatically as Bitcoin operators are able.\n\nBitcoin mining facilities\u2019 ability to shut off almost instantly not only allows them to save money, but even to make money by manipulating the US power markets: they can avoid fees charged during peak demand, resell their energy at a premium when prices spike and even, as in Texas in 2021, be paid to turn off.\n\nIn practice, even though Bitcoin companies are paid by the grid to promise to power down if necessary to prevent blackouts, they are rarely asked to do so. As such, they earn extra money for operating as normal. In Texas, five operations have made a collective $60 million from the program since 2020. Bitdeer\u2019s 2021 windfall came as a result of such an agreement.\n\nSeveral companies are being paid through these agreements a majority of the time they operate. Most years, they are asked to turn off for only a few hours, at which point they are paid even more. \u201cIronically, when people are paying the most for their power, or losing it altogether, the miners are making money selling energy back to Texans at rates 100 times what they paid,\u201d said Ed Hirs, who teaches energy economics at the University of Houston.\n\nAlongside hospitals, industries including metals and plastics manufacturing also need a lot of electricity, causing pollution and raising power prices. Manufacturing might not save lives but it does at least bring jobs to an area. Bitcoin mines tend to employ only a few dozen people once constructed, spurring less local economic development.\n\nBitcoin operations\u2019 financial benefit goes almost exclusively to their owners and operators. In 2021, the year Bitcoin\u2019s price peaked, 20 executives at five publicly-traded Bitcoin companies together received nearly $16 million in salary and over $630 million in stock options.\n\nEssentially, as well as the repercussions of such huge power usage, Bitcoin mining benefits only a very few, while the masses suffer the impact of carbon emissions and raised prices. Although Bitcoin\u2019s value has dropped, seeing two of the largest United States-based companies file for bankruptcy, new mines continue opening across the country.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though are aren\u2019t options for operating cryptocurrency with less electricity: Ethereum, second-most popular cryptocurrency, switched its algorithm to cut the amount of electricity needed to power its network by 99%. Bitcoin advocates oppose changing its algorithm because proof-of-work has been resistant to attacks for longer and at a greater scale than any other approach to virtual currency stake creation.\n\nLike centers for the development of Artificial Intelligence, cooling the masses of computers used in Bitcoin mining also drains power supplies.\n\nDespite claims from the president of the Texas Blockchain Council, Lee Bratcher, that the industry incentivizes the development of renewable and natural gas plants, Dr. Jenkins at Princeton says that Bitcoin operations are more likely to keep fossil fuel plants in business than lead to more renewable energy. In New York, a gas-powered plant was able to reopen due to a sharp increase in power demand emanating from Bitcoin mining.\n\nTo round off: Bitcoin mining uses huge amounts of power, to the detriment of both the planet and communities near mining plants. It doesn\u2019t just reduce job opportunities, but actively worsens local economies for the profit of a few individuals.\n\nThere\u2019s a Bitdeer mine in an old aluminium smelter just outside Rockdale, where two of the largest mines (for fuel, not cryptocurrency) in the country operate. When the industrial plant where Bitdeer now operates shut down, \u201cit just cut the legs out from under [the] community,\u201d said city manager Barabara Holly.\n\nAt a time when everyone is making sacrifices for the good of the planet \u2014 or should be \u2014 it\u2019s time that huge operations are held accountable. Without any widespread, material benefit Bitcoin mining is perhaps one of the first things that should go.\n\nFor the full report and data, read the New York Times article here."

        "title": "Bitcoin Back Above $30,000. Should You Buy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has pushed above $30,000 for the first time since June last year, peaking at almost $31,400 this morning. Bitcoin's price is up over 80% since the start of this year, according to CoinMarketCap data. That's impressive, but it's still got a long way to go before it regains its 2021 high of almost $69,000. Find out what's behind its recent price action and what it means for investors.\n\nWhat's behind Bitcoin's rally?\n\nThere are several drivers behind Bitcoin's recent rally. Chief among them is speculation that the Federal Reserve may stop increasing interest rates. The Fed has been aggressively pushing interest rates upward in an attempt to get inflation under control. This had a big impact on crypto prices, as it meant people pulled out of riskier assets like Bitcoin. The thinking is that the investors might swing back toward crypto if the Fed eases its tightening measures.\n\nSome insiders think fears around traditional banking are also fuelling price rises. For example, Bradley Duke, co-chief executive officer of ETC Group, told Bloomberg that people are also being drawn to crypto because it's \"an asset outside of traditional banking and finance.\"\n\nSentiment also plays a huge part in Bitcoin's price. This is a market with a lot of speculative price action, and investors often buy when things seem to be going well -- partly out of a fear of missing out -- which pushes prices up further. It's not so surprising, then, that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is into serious greed territory. The index, which uses a couple of factors including momentum, volatility, and social media analysis, hasn't logged such high greed figures since November 2021.\n\nCan it continue to rise?\n\nMany crypto investors want to know whether this might finally mark the end of the crypto winter. It's an understandable question, particularly as many people's portfolios have taken significant hits. But unfortunately, nobody has a crystal ball and it is hard to know whether -- and for how long -- the current rally will continue.\n\nWhat we do know is that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have some serious hurdles to jump in both the near and long term. Regulators have been cracking down on the whole industry. The SEC says many cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities and argues they should come under its remit. If it can push this case successfully, it will have a significant impact on the way we buy and sell crypto.\n\nThere are also growing fears that we're about to enter a recession. This could be another drag on Bitcoin's price as recessions tend to make people more risk averse. More widely, crypto faces a trust issue: the collapse of several crypto platforms has dented people's confidence in the whole industry. This is particularly true as we learn more about what went on behind the scenes at FTX and the degree to which the company mishandled customers' money.\n\nShould you buy?\n\nIf you're considering buying Bitcoin, know that it remains an extremely volatile asset. Think about how it might perform in the long term and make sure you understand the risks involved. We are no longer in the stimulus-laiden climate that fueled the crypto frenzy of 2020 and 2021, and there are no guarantees that prices will ever recover those highs.\n\nIt's also important to be comfortable with the consequences of the relative lack of regulation in the industry. First, there is not a lot in the way of investor protection if your crypto platform fails. Second, if and when authorities introduce more rules, prices will likely fall in the short term. For example, it's only through increased transparency that we'll find out what reserves other crypto players have. Stricter regulation may also uncover the truth of accusations of fraudulent practices, such as wash trading.\n\nAll the same, Bitcoin evangelists argue that the leading crypto could transform the way we use money and it may be the digital currency of the future. If you think their logic holds water and want to own crypto, it's important to manage the level of risk you're taking on and make sure it only represents a small portion of your overall portfolio. Follow the golden rules of crypto investing: Only invest money you can afford to lose and use a crypto exchange that you trust."

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nBitcoin (BTC) moved past $30,000 for the first time since June 10, 2022, as March's banking turbulence faded into the distance and investors grew more optimistic about U.S. central bank monetary policy.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $30,237, up 6.75% over the last 24 hours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the market is pricing a slowdown in growth, and in turn a loosening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve over the course of 2023,\" said Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa, a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider for crypto. \"For evidence of this, just look at the bond market.\"\n\nA check of the bond market shows the U.S. two-year Treasury note having fallen to below 4% from a peak above 5% in early March as traders rapidly reversed their expectations of future Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.\n\n\"There will likely still be a lot of liquidity injected into the market as a result,\" added Mico. \"Already, bitcoin has been the best-performing asset of 2023, and it usually is the asset that responds most quickly and violently to these kinds of monetary shifts.\"\n\nBitcoin last topped $30,000 on June 10 as it was on its way down to below $20,000, where it spent large parts of late 2022 and into the first weeks of 2023. It has been hovering around $28,000 for the past three weeks as wary investors gauged the impact of a near banking meltdown, continued inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic uncertainties. Bitcoin is up about 80% year to date after starting the year at about $16,600.\n\nThe crypto surged in January on signs that inflation was waning. Bitcoin stalled in February but then regained momentum in late March following the failure of Silicon Valley and Signature banks when some investors questioned the stability of the current monetary system and regained their appetite for assets that hold their value. Gold also recently spiked, topping $2,000 for the first time since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nMico noted that there is certainly a narrative shift happening because of the banking crisis feeding into bitcoin\u2019s momentum. Increasingly, \"BTC is also being seen as a reliable store of value that lacks the issues that come with storing your money by way of a third-party intermediary, or a bank,\" he added. \"BTC is now properly starting to be perceived as a risk-off asset.\"\n\n\"De-dollarization is also increasingly becoming part of the narrative, which is further accelerating BTC adoption,\" Mico concluded. \"With BTC, in short, you are your own bank. It\u2019s difficult to make predictions given the volatility of late, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this momentum regarding BTC continues.\"\n\nIn an email to CoinDesk, Bob Ras, co-founder of Sologenic, a blockchain-powered network for tokenizing securities, noted that bitcoin had decoupled from stocks and shown \"its increasing appeal as a safe haven for investors.\"\n\n\"While the 2020-2021 period was perceived as Bitcoin's breakthrough moment, the present time truly marks its ascendance onto the global stage as a formidable asset,\" Ras wrote. \"Amidst heightened geopolitical instability, faltering banking systems and mounting concerns surrounding reserve currencies, bitcoin has emerged as the reliable refuge that many had anticipated. This crucial juncture signifies a pivotal advancement for the digital asset sector.\u201d\n\nUPDATE (April 11, 2023, 02:16 UTC): Adds comment from Bob Ras.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its value has varied significantly in the last few years. Bitcoin mining involves running complex calculations to encrypt blocks of data.\n\nThe charges against Christopher Naples. Source: Southampton Town Justice Court\n\nNaples, of Mattituck, has been suspended with pay. He earned $149,721 last year, according to payroll records. He has not responded to interview requests. His attorney, William Keahon, said he expected the case to be resolved soon. Naples has another court date in May.\n\nThe court records show for the first time that county IT professionals working in County Executive Steve Bellone's administration were aware of the illegal bitcoin mining. The Suffolk clerk is an independently elected office, but its data center is under the purview of the county's Department of Information Technology.\n\nThe question for management, said John Bandler, who teaches cybersecurity at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, is, \u201cHow did it allow this to happen essentially in the open and for so long?\u201d\n\nSuffolk officials, including Chief Deputy County Executive Lisa Black and IT Commissioner Scott Mastellon, did not respond to numerous requests for interviews. Deputy County Executive Vanessa Baird-Streeter said: \"We will not comment on a pending criminal matter being prosecuted by the district attorney's office.\"\n\nCybersecurity experts interviewed by Newsday said the bitcoin mining might have contributed to opening up the county\u2019s system to the ransomware attack. Bellone last year released a report on the cyberattack that found it started in the county clerk's office as early December 2021; took advantage of a common security flaw in computer systems; and spread throughout the computer network, halting the county's websites and servers. In the months after Naples' arrest, the county clerk's office sought a security upgrade, but a steering committee \u2014 chaired by the county IT commissioner \u2014 rebuffed it, according to emails obtained by Newsday.\n\n\"The issue is that there are so many other attacks on municipalities around the country that are going through this. So, are they related? Possibly. Probably. Certainly, I think there\u2019s a huge chance it was,\u201d said Michael Nizich, director of the Entrepreneurship and Technology and Innovation Center at New York Institute of Technology.\n\nWill Cong, Cornell University Rudd Family professor of management, said the bitcoin mining may have indirectly increased the county\u2019s exposure to a ransomware attack, just as browsing certain websites does.\n\nAttorney William Keahon is representing Christopher Naples, the Suffolk County employee who allegedly ran an illegal bitcoin mining operation. Credit: James Carbone\n\nBellone suggested in a December news conference that Naples, \u201cthe architect of the clerk\u2019s IT environment,\u201d for years delayed a key security upgrade that could have blocked the ransomware attack because he didn\u2019t want outsiders discovering his illegal mining operation.\n\nKeahon disputed that.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do everything he can to shift the blame,\u201d he said of Bellone.\n\nIn response to Keahon, Baird-Streeter, the deputy county executive, said: \"No official forensic examination has been released nor has the Legislature conducted their review, obviously.\"\n\nThe full court file lays out the suspicions of county IT employees and their unease with the unusual devices they saw not just in the data center but around Naples\u2019 desk. The file also paints a picture of an increasingly brazen Naples, who kept bringing in more bitcoin mining devices, even after a subordinate asked about them. There were so many devices \u2014 46 in all \u2014 that they raised the temperature in the data center by 20 degrees and set off alarms.\n\nNonetheless, the court file shows, IT employees were reluctant to remove them, despite the damage the high heat could do to other equipment, or even to confront Naples.\n\nOne systems analyst, Christopher Rizopoulos, who worked for Naples, told detectives in a statement: \u201cI am aware the bitcoining units were not OK. I wanted to notify someone. However, I was really concerned about repercussions from Chris Naples. I didn\u2019t want him to seek revenge.\u201d\n\n\"I am aware the bitcoining units were not OK. I wanted to notify someone. However, I was really concerned about repercussions from Chris Naples.

Naples\u2019 father, builder Jim Naples Sr., has contributed money to Romaine's political campaigns, giving at least $7,650, state records show.\n\nJim Naples Sr. also contributed at least $2,300 to Judy Pascale, who followed Romaine as clerk.\n\nRizopoulos also told detectives that in 2017, Brian Bartholomew, the county\u2019s information security coordinator, said, \u201cThese guys are bitmining.\u201d\n\nThe Suffolk County Clerk's office, where employees reported seeing bitcoin mining devices. Credit: Chris Ware\n\nBartholomew\u2019s attorney, Ray Doyle, declined to comment. Rizopoulos did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\nAnother systems analyst, Matthew Ballantine, became alarmed when he noticed the excessive heat in the data center.\n\n\u201cI know that heat is not good for the equipment, so I looked for the source of the heat,\u201d he said in a statement to investigators. \u201cThat\u2019s what caused me to find several devices that appeared to be hidden inside the server racks.\u201d\n\nAt first, Ballantine wasn\u2019t sure what they were and thought there might be a legitimate reason for them. Later in the day, he realized that they might be bitcoin miners. But because he wasn\u2019t authorized to remove the equipment, he instead told Vincent Cordiale, assistant manager of IT operations. Ballantine offered to photograph the equipment the next time he was in the data center. He took the photos of 10 bitcoin miners on Feb. 9, 2021, and showed them to Cordiale.\n\nBallantine and Cordiale did not respond to requests for interviews.\n\nAround July 16, 2021, Ballantine returned to the data center with several other systems analysts to work on some network problems. One analyst, Anthony Oliveto, noticed the excessive heat. Ballantine pointed out the devices and saw additional ones sitting atop server racks, according to his statement.\n\n\u201cNone of us had any more conversations about the equipment, but I believe everyone had an understanding that they were miners that probably did not belong in the data center,\u201d Ballantine said in his statement.\n\nAn IT employee who is not named in court records told his superiors, who notified the Suffolk district attorney, according to a statement by district attorney investigator Christopher Acquilino, who led the investigation.\n\nWhat followed was an investigation marked both by technical complexity and cloak-and-dagger technique, such as entering the building in the middle of the night to install covert video equipment.\n\nOn July 29, 2021, special investigator John Primiano and systems analyst Mark Enoch visited the data center after employees left, about 6:45 p.m. They immediately noticed the high heat \u2014 it was 89 degrees \u2014 and saw an LCD display flashing a red warning light as a high-temperature alarm, despite several large fans in the room. The ideal temperature is just under 70 degrees.\n\nSeveral branch circuits were nearing overload, as the miners were connected to county power strips. They also noticed that someone had put duct tape over the miners\u2019 identification labels, according to Primiano\u2019s statement.\n\nThey counted 21 bitcoin miners.\n\nAbout five hours later at 12:15 a.m., investigators installed a video camera system in the public corridor next to the data center, according to Primiano\u2019s statement. They finished by 2 a.m. and left the building.\n\nTheir nighttime work paid off. They saw Naples installing one of the devices in the data center, according to Acquilino\u2019s statement.\n\nDistrict attorney investigators executed a search warrant on Aug. 19, 2021. This time, they found 46 machines.\n\n\u201cSCDAO investigators found devices in server racks, on top of server racks, on Naples\u2019 desk, under removable floorboards in the data center and in an unused electrical wall panel,\u201d according to Acquilino\u2019s statement.\n\nEquipment used in the illegal bitcoin mining operation that Suffolk authorities displayed in 2021. Credit: John Roca\n\nNaples showed up at 11:30 a.m. District attorney investigators searched the data center and Naples agreed to answer questions, according to Primiano\u2019s statement. Naples acknowledged that he installed the miners to earn money and \u201cindicated that he bought the servers from eBay and 'they were six for $90.' \"\n\nTwo hours after investigators removed the machines, the temperature in the data center dropped 20 degrees.\n\nJust how much Naples earned in cryptocurrency is not revealed in the court file. But at the time he was mining, a single bitcoin was worth $30,000 to $40,000, Cong said.\n\nA bitcoin is now worth about $28,000.\n\nBitcoin is a form of cryptocurrency. It is based on what is known as the blockchain, which is a series of data points linked together. The blockchain serves as a public ledger that anyone can see. Each block in the chain is encrypted through a highly complex and secure algorithm. Because no one has been able to break the code, it is extremely valuable, Nizich said.\n\nAdding a block to the chain requires that somebody make sure that the encryption was done right. That\u2019s called \u201cproof of work,\u201d which is the same as bitcoin mining. That\u2019s done through a complex mathematical process. When someone successfully completes a proof of work, the reward is a bitcoin. Because people all over the world are trying to solve the same mathematical problems, there\u2019s intense competition, Nizich said.\n\n\u201cSo you have to have a really good algorithm and a really powerful device \u2014 not just a single computer or PC \u2014 you have to have a very special device, using what is called an ASIC processor, or you have to have some sort of distributing process level. It wouldn\u2019t be something you\u2019d have usually in your home office,\u201d he said.\n\nNaples\u2019 operation was \u201cextremely sophisticated,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause these devices use enormous amounts of energy, it\u2019s not practical to do it at home. A single device uses the same amount it takes to run a house for 24 hours in just 45 minutes, Nizich said.\n\nA conservative estimate of the cost of the electricity used by Naples' machines was $6,477 from Feb. 10, 2021, though Aug. 10, 2021, according to the court file.\n\nThe machines also used so much county bandwidth that employees working on the weekend couldn\u2019t access the internet, Bellone said in December."

The bill, proposed by Republican Senator Joshua Bryant on March 30, seeks to protect miners from discriminatory regulations and taxes with clearer guidelines.\n\nIt states that crypto miners will be required \u201cto pay applicable taxes and government fees in acceptable forms of currency and operate in a manner that causes no stress on an electric public utility\u2019s generation capabilities or transmission network.\u201d\n\nUnder the legislation, crypto miners will have the same rights as data centers, which the state recognizes as a value to the local economy.\n\nThe move in Arkansas reflects a similar action in Montana in February when the state Senate passed a bill to offer legal protections to cryptocurrency miners, such as prevention of discriminatory electricity rates.\n\nThe picture in Texas is more mixed, with legislation introduced on April 4 that would eliminate some incentives for crypto miners in the state, while in March, the state introduced a bill in support of Bitcoin mining, which is still pending at the House Committee on State Affairs.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. regulators such as the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have fined and filed lawsuits against crypto trading platforms, such as Kraken and Binance, claiming they lack legal approvals to sell some of their services.\n\nCongressman Tom Emmer of the Republican Party has criticized SEC chair Gary Gensler during a podcast appearance, saying Gensler is \u201cblindly spraying the crypto community with enforcement actions while completely missing the truly bad actors.\u201d\n\nThe administration of President Joe Biden has also proposed an excise tax on crypto miners that equals 30 percent of the cost of electricity they use.\n\nSee related article: Thai opposition pledges US$15 bln in digital tokens: Bloomberg"

        "content": "The Lightning Network uses peer-to-peer technology to rapidly accelerate Bitcoin payments, letting users carry out rapid transactions for just a few pennies. It\u2019s a promising idea that could finally vault Bitcoin into the mainstream but for one problem: Lightning doesn\u2019t really work.\n\nThat\u2019s the view of David Marcus, who oversaw messaging at Facebook (now Meta) and then led the company\u2019s failed crypto project called Diem, which was snuffed out by hostile politicians and regulators. Today he is the CEO of Lightspark, a startup that\u2019s raised $175 million, and which gives Marcus\u2014also a former president of PayPal\u2014a second chance to preside over a breakthrough moment for crypto.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lightspark announced it has launched a software package that the company says will make it easy for businesses to harness the Lightning network\u2019s potential benefits.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Marcus and his team made the case that Lightspark\u2019s new service\u2014which offers three different pricing tiers based on volume\u2014will make Lightning viable by making the network easy to use and supplying adequate liquidity.\n\nAccording to Lightspark, the current process for using Lightning is too daunting and technical, even for many companies familiar with crypto and payment operations. And even when users do manage to get set up on Lightning, which relies on a series of peer-to-peer \u201cchannels\u201d connecting to nodes, the network often doesn\u2019t work because many node operators do not have enough Bitcoins on hand to immediately process transactions, Marcus claims.\n\nLightspark claims its solution relies on data science to constantly move liquidity to where it\u2019s most needed, making the Lightning network more reliable. It has also created software tools that the firm says will make it practical and easy for businesses to use\u2014a development that Marcus compares to letting people use the internet via a browser rather than the underlying TCP protocol.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made our interface simple, removing all complexity,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt will be familiar to people in businesses who need to integrate payments into their products and services\u2026Lightspark discovers the best-performing nodes and predicts their ability to successfully route transitions. Our infrastructure is up to 15 times more capital efficient than most alternatives.\u201d\n\nThe upshot of all this is that Lightspark believes people soon will be able to avail themselves of a wide variety of nearly instant Bitcoin-based payments. The company says that, for practical purposes, this means it will become possible to buy a wide variety of online services\u2014from music to news articles to Wi-Fi access\u2014quickly and cheaply, with little friction.\n\nMarcus says Lightspark is already working with a number of clients, including crypto wallet providers and the Bitcoin bank and storage firm Xapo, to deploy its service.\n\nLightspark is not the only well-funded company to bet on turning the Lightning network into a mainstream payment tool. Earlier this year, Block (formerly Square), announced a series of initiatives that it says will help solve the network\u2019s liquidity woes.\n\nThese initiatives come after more than a decade of Bitcoin failing to become part of everyday commerce, despite proponents hailing it as a superior payment technology. Marcus, however, believes that this moment will finally arrive, and that Lightspark will play a key role in delivering it."

        "content": "Business intelligence and Fortune 500 company MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin (BTC) investment has turned green again as BTC broke past the critical resistance of around $29,000 to record a new 10-month high of $30,163.\n\nMicroStrategy started investing in Bitcoin in the second quarter of 2020 when the BTC price was trading around $10,000. Since then, the business intelligence firm had made a series of BTC purchases over the period of two years. The firm has accumulated a total of 140,000 Bitcoin, acquired for nearly $4.17 billion at an average price of $29,803 per BTC.\n\nMicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor introduced the Bitcoin strategy as a treasury hedging asset over the United States dollars. Apart from holding BTC personally and on the company\u2019s balance sheet, Saylor also convinced several public companies to accumulate BTC on their balance sheets, including the likes of Tesla, SpaceX and a dozen others.\n\nThe Bitcoin bet made by the Fortune 500 company looked lucrative throughout the bull market in 2021. However, a prolonged crypto winter in 2022 fueled by multiple crypto contagions brought upon by the collapse of leading crypto unicorns, crashed BTC price by over 70%. The same Bitcoin bet that looked lucrative in 2021 attracted a lot of flak from crypto critics as MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin investment was at a 50% loss at the peak bear market in 2022.\n\nHowever, Saylor always maintained that MicroStrategy had full confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s underlying fundamentals and would continue to invest in the top cryptocurrency. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Saylor said that a Bitcoin investment should be judged from a four-year price cycle rather than based on one bear or bull market.\n\nRelated: MicroStrategy adds another 1,045 Bitcoin to its growing crypto treasury\n\nAfter a disastrous 2022, BTC price has shown strength throughout 2023, with the price seeing over a 55% increase in the first quarter of this year. Bitcoin price has closed above the previous month's high three months in a row, a sign considered to be a bullish market indicator and an indication of another bull run on the horizon.\n\nBitcoin price history.

        "title": "The state of the Bitcoin Lightning Network in 2023 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Lightning Network, a layer-2 payment solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, is six years old.\n\nProducts, users and the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) sent on the Lightning Network (LN) has sky-rocketed in 2023, despite the price per Bitcoin slipping under $20,000.\n\nSource: Twitter/Kerooke\n\nThe LN has benefited from the integration into the Nostr protocol \u2014 in which users can send one another satoshis (small amounts of Bitcoin) \u2014 and the proliferation of custodial and noncustodial LN wallets, and its formal integration in territories such as El Salvador and Lugano.\n\nFrom Mediterranean cities to Senegal, the LN is also growing as a peer-to-peer means of payment. Nonetheless, despite its growth, concerns still stymie the network, according to key opinion leaders interviewed during Advancing Bitcoin Developer Conference in London.\n\nEric Sirion, co-founder of Bitcoin mobile app Fedi and maintainer of the Fedimint protocol, explained that running a Lightning node in 2023 is still difficult and that some people don\u2019t bother when faced with the complexity:\n\n\u201cTo keep your own Lightning node running, to keep well connected, like keep your connections up to date with the nodes that are relevant \u2014 it\u2019s a part-time job essentially.\u201d\n\nMatthias Koller, co-founder of Swiss company Pocket Bitcoin, said, \u201cIt has become substantially easier compared to early 2018. However, it is still not \u2018easy\u2019 for the masses.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s exciting to see the development around full node implementations and the progress that\u2019s been made.\u201d\n\nSirion, who wrote the open-source code Fedimint and now works on the Fedi team, explained that custodial Lightning wallets, such as Wallet of Satoshi, are popular among Bitcoin advocates. He\u2019s right: It is the wallet of choice for Nostr, a space dominated by Bitcoiners.\n\nHowever, the reliance on custodial wallets could be a problem for the LN. Trusting a third party with funds, such as Wallet of Satoshi, is contrary to the Bitcoiner mantra, \u201cnot your keys, not your coins,\u201d Sirion said.\n\nFurthermore, Koller explained that the reason many Bitcoiners end up sidestepping the \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d mantra is that some of the custodial solutions are just so easy. \u201cIt\u2019s set up in seconds, ready to transact,\u201d he said, noting:\n\n\u201cBut in fact, it\u2019s no different from keeping Bitcoin on an exchange \u2014 it\u2019s not your Bitcoin. It\u2019s risky if people aren\u2019t aware of the risks involved and the amounts kept in custodial wallets grow in size.\u201d\n\nHowever, Koller conceded that custodial solutions are fine for \u201cpocket money.\u201d The LN is ideal for micropayments, but even so, trusting centralized wallet providers could erode privacy. In response to the rise in custodial wallets, one Twitter user explained, \u201cIf payments are being made from custodial mobile wallets to custodial mobile wallets it\u2019s very simple to link senders and receivers.\u201d\n\nSirion hopes that the rollout of Fedi will undermine the reliance on third parties and provide a straightforward and privacy-centric route to using Bitcoin and Lightning. Fedi uses the open-source protocol Fedimint in which trusted members of a community share ownership of Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re already using custodial service, at least use one where you have a reason to trust the people that are.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the reliance on Lightning custodial wallets could be in part due to the difficulties in running a Lightning node. Node software businesses, such as Amboss and Umbrel, attempt to remedy the issue with improved UX, but in comparison to downloading Bitcoin Core to run a Bitcoin node, there are more steps, and a deeper understanding of Bitcoin is required to run a Lightning node.\n\nFurthermore, in the world of Venmo, Revolut and other near-instant centralized payment services, there\u2019s a risk that Lightning\u2019s free and frictionless payments do not necessarily solve a pressing problem. During Advancing Bitcoin, Alex Leishman, CEO of Bitcoin firm River Financial, told Cointelegraph, \u201cBitcoiners use Lightning mostly because it\u2019s interesting and it\u2019s cool. It\u2019s not solving deep problems in their life.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Lightning Network growth is organic, coming from real-world adoption\n\nKoller joked that the LN is \u201cBitcoin on steroids. Fast, cheap and perfect for small, daily transactions.\u201d Plus, it\u2019s still substantially more private than Google Pay or using Visa or Mastercard at a checkout:\n\n\u201cThe pain I feel every time I have to use a credit card online is just gut-wrenching. Give me Lightning everywhere!\u201d\n\nLeishman would like to see more people working backward from real human problems observed worldwide and see where Lightning can fit in. For example, in the West, the LN could resolve inter-institutional transactions.\n\n\u201cIt can really move the needle on a number of things in the West and in the developing world.\u201d\n\nIn El Salvador, some Salvadorans use the Lightning Network, but cash is still king. Leishman mentions the Taro protocol, which, once implemented, could allow for assets to be issued on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u201cDo people actually just want dollars? And does that mean we want to try to build stablecoins on Lightning with Taro?\u201d he said.\n\nTaro Diagram. Source: River Financial\n\nThese assets could be deposited into Lightning Network payment channels and transacted instantly. In theory, LN users could hold several balances in their wallets, including different stablecoins or dollars.\n\nCurrently, developers can mint, send and receive Taro assets on the test network of the Bitcoin blockchain. In the meantime, LN developers will continue to seek out more user-centric Bitcoin solutions."

However, last night, Bitcoin breached the $30,000 mark for the first time since June 2022. Against all odds, BTC is up ~80% year-to-date. Here are a few important things you should know:\n\n\u201cBuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d: More times than not, the best time to buy a market is when the news is the worst. Indeed, this turned out to be the case for BTC and various BTC proxies such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO). In November 2022, doomed crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy (after committing the largest fraud since Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme), shaking crypto markets. Over that short time, BTC has doubled.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSafe Haven Asset: For months in 2022, Bitcoin was closely correlated to equities, specifically tech, and the Nasdaq. However, in the past few months, Bitcoin has been trading more in sync with gold. Finally, it appears that \u201cBitcoin Maximalists\u201d that believe BTC is a safe haven asset and not just a \u201cyolo\u201d product of easy money central bank policies have something to hang their hats on.\n\nBitcoin Behemoth is Back Onside: In 2020, MicroStrategy (MSTR), a public software company in business since the late 1990s, took the bold and unorthodox step to move to the \u201cBitcoin Standard\u201d. Led by its outspoken and eccentric founder Michael Saylor, MSTR has purchased nearly $4 billion worth of Bitcoin, which translates to roughly 130,000 BTC! In a show of conviction or unfounded confidence (you decide), Saylor and MSTR have dollar cost averaged into BTC the entire way down is finally back to their cost basis of around $30,000 per coin.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBitcoin Halving is Slated for Early 2024: Roughly one year from now, Bitcoin will experience its next \u201cHalving\u201d. Bitcoin halvings occur every four years and refers to when the reward for Bitcoin miners (network validators) is cut in half. Each halving event means that the number of new Bitcoin being let out into circulation is slashed in half. Remember, unlike central bank currencies, Bitcoin is finite \u2013 there will only ever be 21 million in existence. Past halving events have led to dramatic bull markets in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiners are on Fire: Year-to-date, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) is up 97%, making it one of the top-performing ETFs in the entire market. The ETF\u2019s top three holdings include Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), HIVE Blockchain Technologies (HIVE), and Riot Platforms (RIOT).\n\nLong-Term Technical Picture is Improving: While it is hard to chase Bitcoin into a large round number like $30,000 after a rapid short-term move, BTC and BTC proxies like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) are showing improving longer-term technical. GBTC just triggered a bullish golden cross \u2013 a bullish technical signal that occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses over the 200-day from below. While the signal failed the last time, when it happened in 2020, GBTC shot higher from $10 to $60 is rapid order fashion.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Bitcoin mining has raised Texas electricity prices 5% - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A peek inside the data center of a bitcoin mining operation in Russia.\n\nIndustrial-scale bitcoin mining facilities in the US create as much carbon pollution as 3.5 million gas-powered cars, and Texas, which boasts the largest number of mining facilities in the country, will see the cost of electricity rise nearly 5% by mid-2023 due to cryptocurrency mining.\n\n\n\nThose stunning figures come from analyses by tech nonprofit WattTime and energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie for a New York Times investigation into the rise of large-scale bitcoin mining in the US.\n\nRead more\n\nBitcoin miners operate large arrays of computers that are paid fees to solve the cryptological problems that allow the currency to maintain a decentralized database of all its transactions. The investigation found 34 mining operations, each drawing more than 40 megawatts of electricity; many of them were started in the US after China banned the activity there in 2021, partly due to concerns over power usage.\n\nIronically, many of the mines were able to profit from agreements with electrical grids to pause their operations during emergencies. Systems to reward large electricity users that commit to shutting down when the grid is strained, whether they actually do or not, predate the bitcoin miners, but participating in them added tens of millions of dollars to their aggregate bottom lines.\n\nIs bitcoin too big for Texas?\n\nTexas, which governor Gregg Abbott wants to be a \u201ccrypto leader,\u201d has seen major stress on its grid in recent years, particularly rolling blackouts in February 2021 and a failure in 2022 that left 70,000 people without power.\n\nThe additional load created by the miners, equal to tens of thousands of new homes, as well as their participation in incentive programs, increased the cost of electricity by nearly 5% across the state and by as much as 9% in some West Texas communities.\n\nRiot Platforms, the largest miner discussed in the New York Times story, said it paid 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity in Texas in 2022. Other industrial power users in the state paid 7.2 cents, while residents paid 13.5 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin proponents say that other industries aren\u2019t judged on their electricity usage, and that they don\u2019t have a say in how the power they buy is generated. But grid experts say their constant demand for power makes bitcoin mines more reliant on plants that burn fossil fuel.\n\n\n\nThe other question is whether their benefits match the costs: While most forms of power usage offer some obvious added value, the jury is still out on what kind of advantages bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer society besides an opportunity for speculation.\n\nUnlike other industrial power users, which typically generate jobs and products, bitcoin mines employ few people, and the gains from the currency largely accumulate for insiders. The price of a bitcoin has risen 76% this year to nearly $30,000, but it is still more than 50% off its peak value in 2021 after the collapse of FTX and disillusionment with the idea of \u201cWeb3.\u201d\n\nMore from Quartz\n\nSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

        "content": "On April 11, European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares published its latest \u201cDigital Asset Fund Flows Report,\u201d revealing that digital asset investment products experienced positive sentiment, with inflows totaling $57 million last week, bringing them back to a net positive position year-to-date. However, despite this, \u201cvolumes were low at $970 million for the week.\u201d The global Bitcoin (BTC) exchange market also saw low volumes, \u201djust 25% of the year-to-date average at $18 billion for the week.\u201d\n\nWeekly crypto asset flows in millions (U.S. dollars). Source: CoinShares\n\nAccording to the report, inflows were primarily driven by investors in the United States, with $27 million in inflows. Germany, Switzerland and Canada also saw positive sentiment, with inflows totaling $17 million, $13 million and $2.2 million, respectively, indicating a broad-based increase in confidence toward digital assets.\n\nInvestors primarily focused on Bitcoin, which received $56 million in inflows, accounting for 98% of all inflows. Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin suffered minor outflows totaling $0.6 million. In contrast, altcoins \u2014 including Uniswap\u2019s UNI (UNI), Polkadot\u2019s DOT (DOT) and Polygon\u2019s MATIC (MATIC) \u2014 saw minor inflows of less than $1 million each.\n\nThe report also notes that, despite the Ethereum network\u2019s Shapella upgrade scheduled for April 12, Ether (ETH) inflows were relatively minor at $600,000, suggesting that perhaps investors are cautious about investing in ETH until they are more confident about the impact of the upgrade. Additionally, blockchain equities saw minor inflows totaling $2.1 million, indicating a relatively quiet week for the market segment.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price retests key support level that preceded 60% gains in June 2022\n\nOverall, the positive sentiment in the digital asset market last week \u2014 despite low volumes \u2014 indicates that investors remain bullish on the prospects of cryptocurrency. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin has reclaimed $30,000, its highest price since June 2022. Over the last 30 days, BTC recorded gains of nearly 46%, rising to its highest level in 10 months on April 11.\n\nBitcoin price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nOn April 5, American business intelligence firm MicroStrategy added another 1,045 BTC to its growing crypto treasury, for approximately $29.3 million at an average price of $28,016 per BTC. Saylor has been a prominent Bitcoin proponent, urging businesses to incorporate the leading cryptocurrency into their strategic asset allocation. He has consistently emphasized his belief that Bitcoin is the most dependable, secure store of value available in the current market and presents a distinctive avenue for enterprises to safeguard their assets against inflation."

        "content": "A few solutions are being discussed to fix a code bug found in the Bitcoin (BTC)-native Ordinals protocol that has prevented over 1,200 inscriptions from being validated.\n\nWhile nearly every member of the Ordinals community agrees that these inscription requests should be reincluded, the community is debating whether they should be added retroactively or not.\n\nThe bug came from the indexer function of the protocol only counting inscriptions that were in the first input of a transaction submitted up to and including version 0.5.1 of the protocol.\n\nOne prominent Ordinals member known on Twitter as \u201cLeonidas.og\u201d summarized the pros and cons of each solution in an April 10 tweet, coming a few days after the issue was first made public on April 5 by the GitHub user \u201cveryordinally.\u201d\n\nA bug was found in the ordinals protocol that caused ~1,200 inscriptions that should have been valid to not get included. The first of these \"orphan\" inscriptions happened just before inscription number 420,285. The bug was caused by the ordinals protocol only counting\u2026 \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) April 10, 2023\n\nThe first solution involves selecting a block height to retroactively index the so-called \u201corphan\u201d inscriptions from inscription number 420,285 onwards, which is roughly where the first orphan inscription was identified.\n\n\u201cThis feels like the \u2018purist\u2019 solution because it means the ordinals protocol would correctly match the logical ordering on-chain,\u201d Leonidas.og explained, despite acknowledging that the reshuffling \u201cmay cause other complications.\u201d\n\nWe currently have 1206 \u201chidden\u201d inscriptions that are not indexed due to https://t.co/VZHCNaBmw0 - join the discussion on GitHub on this interesting consensus and decentralized protocol evolution issue \u2014 ordinally (@veryordinally) April 10, 2023\n\nThe alternative is to not change inscription numbers that have already been validated and to pick a block height to add these orphan inscriptions in at some time in the future, Leonidas.og explained:\n\n\u201cThis would not change any existing inscription numbers so the ~1,200 orphans would not be assigned inscription numbers officially in the protocol. It would be up to the market to value them as \u2018misprints\u2019 or not.\u201d\n\nAnother Ordinals GitHub community member, \u201cYilak,\u201d argued in favor of not changing up the order because only a fraction of inscription owners have been impacted.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals daily inscriptions surge due to \u2018BRC-20 tokens\u2019\n\nAt the time of writing, 67.5% of 1,266 voters are in favor of not changing the inscription numbers, according to a Twitter poll created by Leonidas.og.\n\nOn April 8, the number of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions surpassed 1 million, according to data from the crypto analytics platform Dune. It came just days after daily new inscriptions hit a record of over 76,300 on April 4.\n\nOrdinals are considered to be digital artifacts on the Bitcoin network, similar to nonfungible tokens. They can compromise of images, PDFs, video or audio formats.\n\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom"

        "title": "Tracing cryptocurrency: Q&A with the PhD candidate and her adviser who proved it wasn't anonymous - The Record from Recorded Future News",
        "content": "For years now, dark web markets have flourished on the assumption that their currency of choice \u2014 crypto \u2014 was untraceable. But it turns out the blockchain, the giant digital ledger that keeps track of the world\u2019s cryptocurrency transactions, had a secret: It contained all the clues anyone needed to connect underground purchases to people in the real world.\n\nThe first person to publish a paper saying as much was a PhD candidate at University of California, San Diego named Sarah Meiklejohn, in 2013. Her work changed the way law enforcement investigated crimes in cyberspace and helped private companies develop new tools to track and identify bad guys on the dark web.\n\nClick Here spoke with Meiklejohn and her adviser, Stefan Savage, about how they came to track cryptocurrency transactions \u2014 and why so much of it depended on an unlikely thing: shopping.\n\nWe\u2019ve edited our conversations with them for length and clarity.\n\nClick Here: Sarah, how did you end up being so fascinated by bitcoin?\n\nSarah Meiklejohn: It was pretty random how I got into bitcoin. I had heard about it in the summer of 2011. It was starting to get a bit bigger then. The price of a bitcoin had kind of a brief spike in the summer of 2011. I heard about it as this way to buy drugs on the internet, because that was kind of when Silk Road was first emerging.\n\nAnd then I didn't really think about it much to be honest, until one of the postdocs in our research group at UCSD. \u2026 We were out on a hike in the desert and he brought up bitcoin and was telling me all about the consensus protocol that bitcoin uses and how it's really fascinating and yeah, I mean he was really into it and it kind of got me interested as well. And I went home from that hike and kind of started looking at the white paper and pretty quickly we just started working on a project on it.\n\nCH: The white paper is of course the one written by Satoshi Nakamoto \u2026 which laid out how a digital currency like bitcoin could work and how a digital ledger called the Blockchain could keep track of all the transactions.\n\nSM: What I think made me more interested in bitcoin was this question of privacy. I think in the beginning, you know, we all just were kind of like, \u201cwhoa, bitcoin, like, what's anyone doing with it? You know, how's it being used?\u201d\n\nThe research group that I ended up doing this work with and working quite closely with, had a huge amount of expertise in empirical analysis of kind of shady activities on the internet, for lack of a better way to put it. They had done all this work looking at botnets and looking at spam and looking at all these kinds of phenomena on the internet. So they had a really strong empirical way of doing things and I wanted to try that out. And I think that was more than anything the driving factor behind the project. Just curiosity and a desire to develop a new skill set.\n\nCH: So how did the idea of just starting to buy things and trace the transactions come about?\n\nStefan Savage: We as a group had actually been involved in a lot of this kind of undercover purchasing activity for a while, just not about bitcoin.\n\nWe had cut a deal with a bank that allowed us to effectively issue credit cards and then track the flow of money, and so we bought like $50,000 worth of counterfeit drugs and then tracked the flow of money back to the banks they came from.\n\nAnd so I think that notion of following the money by buying things and then seeing what happened was something that was pretty central to the research enterprise at the time.\n\nCH: Was there like a conversation in which you said, \u201cHey, we were buying all these pharmaceuticals and following the money that way, should we do the same thing here?\u201d\n\nSS: Sarah came up with the idea that, look, you have this anonymous identifier that corresponds to either a person or an exchange or a retailer, and it is anonymous.\n\nSo long as no one uses it. There's these side effects when you touch the real world in some way.\n\nSM: We had all these techniques that we were developing for saying that these multiple bitcoin addresses or pseudonyms belonged to the same entity, whether that entity was an individual user or a big company like an exchange or something like that.\n\nAnd so that was kind of all well and good, you know, we could say, \u201coh wow, look at that entity. They control 300,000 bitcoin addresses. And this one has fewer. And look, that entity is sending bitcoins back and forth with that other one.\u201d\n\nBut on their own, these aren't very insightful things to say, right? You're only really gonna understand what's going on if you actually know who these entities are, right? So it's like, \u201cOh wow, look at that exchange. It's sending a lot of money to Silk Road.\u201d Then it becomes more interesting.\n\nAnd so basically, without engaging in these kinds of transactions ourselves, we weren't going to know who Entity X was. Whereas if we could actually interact with some of these services, we might be able to say, oh yeah, Entity X is this big exchange.\n\nCH: It seems to me even that little step that you started with, the idea that you could cluster these transactions together \u2026 even that is new, right? Didn't people think that the blockchain was utterly anonymous?\n\nSM: People probably did think that bitcoin was anonymous in the early days. I will say though, the ability to cluster together different types of addresses was already acknowledged in [Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s] white paper. You know, it's like there's one sentence. that basically says that the most common way that we cluster things is we say all the inputs in a bitcoin transaction belong to the same user.\n\nSo I would say it was new in the kind of scale and how far we pushed it. But the actual idea of clustering together, at least based on that kind of approach is actually not new. It was already out there to begin with.\n\nSS: There was an assumption that because there were no names in bitcoin, there was no addresses, there was no number that was linked back to an individual where they had filed some paperwork, that it was really anonymous. And, um, that's not the same as being anonymous. Just because the wallet ID or the cryptographic ID in bitcoin does not have your name on it does not mean that you're anonymous.\n\nCH: So then how do you get to purchasing physical objects?\n\nSM: So yeah, we got to this point in the research where we just realized, OK, we're not gonna get any further until we know who these entities are. So basically what we started doing is just interacting with literally any entity in the bitcoin ecosystem who was willing to interact with us.\n\nSo that primarily meant opening a lot of accounts with exchanges, for example, or other so-called wallet services, and then interacting with those services, right? So basically creating an account, saying \u201cI would like to deposit some money into my account,\u201d getting them to give you a bitcoin address. Then you can confidently say that that bitcoin address is controlled by that entity.\n\nAnd then you can also go and withdraw your money from that service. And again, go look at the blockchain, see these addresses that were used for that withdrawal, and again, say with a hundred percent confidence, \u201cI know that these addresses belong to that entity.\u201d\n\nSo, the main way that we did this was by interacting with exchanges, because those were the main entities who were willing to interact with us. But the other entities who were willing to interact with us were vendors. People or services, shops wanting to sell things to people who were willing to pay in bitcoin. So that's basically how we ended up buying physical objects.\n\nI don't remember the literal first object we bought, it might have been, just for fun, the Guy Fawkes mask or something like that.\n\nSS: We gave [Sarah] a bunch of money. Two, $3,000 or something like that. And there were crazy things she would buy.\n\nLike a Boston CD and socks, and so forth. Everything from \u2026 I think we got like scones or something one time, to \u2026 I have a coffee cup here that she bought. She was ordering dozens of things a day at the peak.\n\nIt wasn't utilitarian. It was, I need to get a purchase from some wallet in this cluster that my algorithm has identified. Let me go and see things that are likely to get me there. She made sure to get all of the big online payment platforms. Mt. Gox, obviously \u2026 she identified all of the things from Mt. Gox. We did do some legal purchases on Silk Road so that we could identify all of the Silk Road wallets.\n\nCH: And was Silk Road one of the entities that you were tracking?\n\nSM: Absolutely. We identified over 200,000 addresses controlled by Silk Road. And one of the case studies we did in our paper revolved around a big address that was associated with Silk Road at the time.\n\nCH: So, in the white paper, Satoshi basically says that bitcoin transactions have these multiple inputs that lead to linking. Can you walk us through how you solve that puzzle of how the money gets moved?\n\nSM: Well, so if multiple addresses have been used as input of the same transaction, then they belong to the same entity. This is something that we call the multi input heuristic. So that heuristic is really useful for collapsing things down into like semantically meaningful entities, right?\n\nSo that you can say with a lot of confidence, \u201cthis exchange controls these 300,000 addresses.\u201d Even though you didn't see that exchange use every single one of those 300,000 addresses yourself, by the way that those addresses got used in transactions you can be reasonably confident in this conclusion.\n\nSo the insight we had was that if I interact with this exchange, let's say, then that's a transaction. They will use the address that they gave to me for my deposit\u2026 They'll use it in some other transaction or in some way. And the idea is that if the way that they transact with it involves using it as input with other addresses, then there's a chance that I could identify this address as landing within one of these larger clusters.\n\nSo we could see money was flowing from one exchange to another, or from one service to another. And I think that coupling this ability with this idea of being able to kind of follow and track bitcoins as they went around the network, the idea is that we could see users interact with services like individual users.\n\nAnd you know, this was around the time when. When basically FinCEN was starting to impose, like know your customer requirements on exchanges, and so we actually knew, or could hypothesize that if we saw a user deposit money into an account or an exchange, that it would be possible with subpoena power or if you were that exchange to actually identify who that user was. Like their real identity, not just what addresses they controlled in bitcoin.\n\nWe used as case studies a number of big thefts that had happened in bitcoin and other potential criminal behavior. And a lot of the times we could really confidently track illicit money right to the doorstep of a big exchange.\n\nThis has serious impact on the anonymity not just of potential criminals, but really of anyone. That you could basically see how they moved their money around in the bitcoin blockchain itself. We could trace things quite easily ourselves just by accessing the blockchain.\n\nCH: So you don't even really necessarily need the subpoena.\n\nSM: I mean, you know, if you wanna know who a user actually is, like their name, then yeah, at some point you do need the subpoena. But I mean that's the kind of crazy thing ultimately about the bitcoin blockchain, I guess, right?\n\nIt's completely transparent. Anyone who wants can just download it and, and look at every transaction that's happening.\n\nCH: And did you ever think that what you were doing was going to give rise to an entire industry?\n\nSM: Uh, no. No, I did not.\n\nCH: Why not?\n\nSM: I mean, you know, I'm an academic. I kind of thought of it as a small academic experiment. I thought that scaling it up would be a lot of work. I mean, it was time consuming. I basically did nothing else for like a month straight. It was basically a very manual process. And so I was just like, oh, come on. Like, who's gonna do that at any kind of real scale, right?\n\n**CH: How about you, Stefan? In your wildest dreams, did you ever think that Sarah's research would actually end up growing into an industry? **\n\nSS: No, I think in part because, when we first conceived of Sarah's project, it was not to trace cryptocurrency. I mean, we did want to break through the anonymity, but it was not designed to be kind of an operational tool. We wrote this paper to try to say what is bitcoin being used for? Rather than come up with a tool.\n\nWe didn't know it was gonna take off and all of us thought that bitcoin was kind of crazy. So the notion that it would become big enough that there would be businesses focused on tracing it, was not on our radar at all.\n\nCH: When your paper came out, what was the reaction?\n\n**SM: **Oh, I got a lot of emails, I did talk to a lot of reporters and stuff like that. Also increasingly law enforcement, policymaker types. I also got a lot of personal emails though, from people who had lost their bitcoins or had them stolen and literally didn't know who else to ask. So they were emailing me. I did try to engage with a lot of them and, you know, was often fairly unsuccessful as you might expect.\n\nSS: We ended up talking to everyone from the law enforcement side to folks in Treasury to Homeland Security. There were staffers who were calling us. It was all of a sudden a point of significant interest.\n\nThere was a decision going on in the U.S. government about what should we do here? Should we just shut the whole thing down? Should we have a light touch? And [the paper] provided some comfort to the people who were very concerned to say, well, it's not going to be untraceable. So maybe we don't need to have as hard-line a response.\n\nCH: Are you still doing this sort of thing now? Stefan, did this project change what your research focus was?\n\nSS: So, this all gets finished up at the same time as Sarah's looking for jobs. She goes off, becomes a faculty member. And I think none of us really thought this whole thing would take off the way it did. We continued to be skeptics.\n\nWe did some stuff with ransomware, and tracking ransomware using cryptocurrency. But it was kind of one-off projects. We have only recently started to get involved again, and mainly because the magnitude of the thefts are just phenomenal. That hundreds of millions of dollars of value is getting lost at a shot has made it interesting again.\n\nI think tracing is kind of a done issue, but that world has now become much more complex. It's not just one currency, it's lots of them. And there are these bridges between them. And there are these things called smart contracts that allow transactions to have kind of arbitrary kinds of constraints on them. And that has allowed for very sophisticated fraud to take place. And so now we are starting to do some work in that space again."

        "title": "Riot Platforms responds to NYT article on Bitcoin mining - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Riot Platforms has responded to claims from The New York Times regarding its crypto mining practices, as seen in a statement on April 10.\n\nRiot contests energy use claims\n\nOn April 9, the New York Times published an article titled \u201cThe Real-World Cost of the Digital Race for Bitcoin,\u201d which described the activities of 34 U.S. Bitcoin mining firms.\n\nIn that piece, Riot was named the largest of those operations. The NYT alleged that Riot used 450 MW of power, 96% of which came from fossil fuels, and said that the firm produced 1.9 million tons of CO2 emissions per year.\n\nRiot responded by stating that it uses power from the Texas electrical grid, which relies on 24% wind energy, 10% nuclear energy, and 4% solar energy. Furthermore, Riot said that it operates in rural regions where wind and solar are \u201cabundant and otherwise wasted\u201d during off-peak times and takes advantage of that available energy.\n\nRiot asserted that its Bitcoin mining operations \u201cdo not generate any greenhouse gas emissions\u201d and instead use energy just like other data centers.\n\nFurthermore, Riot confronted claims that Bitcoin mining can affect the overall energy market and its prices. Riot alleged that electricity prices are increasing for reasons that are not related to Bitcoin mining, such as monetary policy, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and restrictive energy policies \u2014 a term often applied to the Biden administration.\n\nRiot went on to contest claims about the amount of savings that Riot has obtained by participating in energy-saving programs, assertions that those programs do harm to energy availability and prices, and claims about the infrequency of those programs.\n\nBroader mining industry also discussed\n\nOverall, Riot said that the NYT article contained a \u201cfalse and distorted view\u201d of both its own company and the crypto-mining industry more generally.\n\nThe company suggested that The New York Times ignored data provided by Riot and instead chose to make politically motivated claims. It warned that selectively granting electrical access to parties based on their activities is a \u201cdangerous path.\u201d\n\nVarious other members of the crypto community have also criticized the article by The New York Times.\n\nNYT\u2019s claims are part of long-standing criticisms about Bitcoin and its energy use. Around 2017, data emerged suggesting that Bitcoin mining uses as much energy as certain countries. Though Bitcoin still uses a large amount of energy, about half of all Bitcoin mining relies on renewable energy, according to some estimates.\n\nCriticism around energy use was extended to NFTs when those assets became popular in 2021. However, Ethereum, which serves as the basis for most NFTs, has discontinued crypto mining. It no longer relies on competitive energy use to confirm transactions.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "The real-world costs of the digital race for bitcoin - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas was gasping for electricity. Winter Storm Uri had knocked out power plants across the state, leaving tens of thousands of homes in icy darkness. By the end of Feb. 14, 2021, nearly 40 people had died, some from the freezing cold.Meanwhile, in the husk of a onetime aluminum smelting plant an hour outside of Austin, row upon row of computers were using enough electricity to power about 6,500 homes as they raced to earn bitcoin , the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency The computers were performing trillions of calculations per second, hunting for an elusive combination of numbers that bitcoin\u2019s algorithm would accept. About every 10 minutes, a computer somewhere guesses correctly and wins a small number of bitcoins worth, in recent weeks, about $170,000. Anyone can try, but to make a business of it can require as much electricity as a small city.In Texas, the computers kept running until just after midnight. Then the state\u2019s power grid operator ordered them shut off, under an agreement that allowed it to do so if the system was about to fail. In return, it began paying the bitcoin company, Bitdeer, an average of $175,000 an hour to keep the computers offline. Over the next four days, Bitdeer would make more than $18 million for not operating, from fees ultimately paid by Texans who had endured the storm.The New York Times has identified 34 such large-scale operations, known as bitcoin mines, in the United States, all putting immense pressure on the power grid and most finding novel ways to profit from doing so. Their operations can create costs \u2014 including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution \u2014 for everyone around them, most of whom have nothing to do with bitcoin.Until June 2021, most bitcoin mining was in China. Then it drove out bitcoin operations, at least for a time, citing their power use among other reasons. The United States quickly became the industry\u2019s global leader.Since then, precisely how much electricity bitcoin mines are using in America and their effect on energy markets and the environment have been unclear. The Times, using both public and confidential records as well as the results of studies it commissioned, put the most comprehensive estimates to date on the largest operations\u2019 power use and the ripple effects of their voracious demand.It is as if another New York City\u2019s worth of residences were now drawing on the nation\u2019s power supply, the Times found.In some areas, this has led prices to surge. In Texas, where 10 of the 34 mines are connected to the state\u2019s grid, the increased demand has caused electric bills for power customers to rise nearly 5%, or $1.8 billion per year, according to a simulation performed for the Times by energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.The additional power use across the country also causes as much carbon pollution as adding 3.5 million gas-powered cars to America\u2019s roads, according to an analysis by WattTime, a nonprofit tech company. Many of the bitcoin operations promote themselves as environmentally friendly and set up in areas rich with renewable energy, but their power needs are far too great to be satisfied by those sources alone. As a result, they have become a boon for the fossil fuel industry: WattTime found that coal and natural gas plants kick in to meet 85% of the demand these bitcoin operations add to their grids.Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets. They can avoid fees charged during peak demand, resell their electricity at a premium when prices spike and even be paid for offering to turn off. Other major energy users, such as factories and hospitals, cannot reduce their power use as routinely or dramatically without severe consequences.In some states, notably New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, bitcoin operators\u2019 revenue can ultimately come from other power customers. The clearest example is Texas, where bitcoin companies are paid by the grid operator for promising to quickly power down if necessary to prevent blackouts. In practice, they rarely are asked to shut down and instead earn additional money while doing exactly what they would have been doing anyway: seeking bitcoin. Five operations have collectively made at least $60 million from that program since 2020, records show.Several of the companies are being paid through these agreements a majority of the time they operate. Most years, they are asked to turn off for only a few hours, at which point they are paid even more.The windfall for Bitdeer during Winter Storm Uri came through this program, in exchange for a fraction of the power it typically used. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Another bitcoin company made tens of millions of dollars reselling electricity during the storm \u2014 and ultimately stands to earn as much as $125 million \u2014 according to its financial filings, which were previously reported by the Tech Transparency Project. A third company told investors that another natural disaster like Uri could be a significant business opportunity.\u201cIronically, when people are paying the most for their power, or losing it altogether, the miners are making money selling energy back to Texans at rates 100 times what they paid,\u201d said Ed Hirs, who teaches energy economics at the University of Houston and has been critical of the industry.In interviews and statements, many of the companies said they were no different from other large power users except for their willingness to shut off quickly to benefit the grid. Several objected to the method the Times and WattTime used to estimate their emissions, which calculated the pollution caused by the additional power generated to satisfy the mines\u2019 demand, showing it to overwhelmingly come from fossil fuels.The companies said this method held them to an unfair standard.\u201cThe analysis cited could be used to attack any industry that consumes power,\u201d said David Fogel, CEO of Coinmint, which operates in upstate New York. \u201cI think the entire notion of singling out specific industries like this is unfair.\u201dBut WattTime\u2019s method is the one many energy and climate experts recommend for measuring the environmental effects of increased power use by any industry, particularly one that grows so large so suddenly.Some in the industry have pushed back against suggestions that it is directly responsible for any environmental harm.A May 2022 letter to the Environmental Protection Agency, signed by many of the biggest companies, said their operations \u201creleased\u201d no pollutants. \u201cBitcoin miners have no emissions whatsoever,\u201d it said. \u201cAssociated emissions are a function of electricity generation.\u201dNic Carter, a partner at a crypto-focused venture capital firm and a prominent bitcoin advocate who told the Times he was the letter\u2019s primary author, said he was playing a \u201clanguage game\u201d when he wrote that bitcoin mining has no emissions. At the time, he said, he felt the industry was being unfairly singled out.\u201cMaybe the more sincere point is like, we\u2019re already fully aware of the emissions associated with utilities generating grid power,\u201d he said.Many academics who study the energy industry said bitcoin mining was undoubtedly having significant environmental effects.\u201cThey\u2019re adding hundreds of megawatts of new demand when we already face the need to rapidly cut fossil power,\u201d said Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor who studies electrical grid emissions.\u201cIf you care about climate change,\u201d he added, \u201cthen that\u2019s a problem.\u201dBitcoin, conceived in 2008, introduced most of the world to the concept of cryptocurrencies. Instead of trusting banks to track the value of accounts, the system publishes transactions on a public ledger called a blockchain. Proponents said that cutting out middlemen would free people from financial institutions, government oversight and fees.So-called mining is a fundamental part of the system: When a computer guesses correctly, it updates the ledger and collects 6 1/4 new bitcoins. Then the guessing game begins again.Initially, hobbyists could win with personal computers, but as the value of each bitcoin soared \u2014 from under $1,000 in 2017 to over $60,000 in 2021 \u2014 mining increasingly became an industrial endeavor. (The price has since dropped and, as of publication, was roughly $28,000.)The only way for miners to better their odds is to add computing power, which requires more electricity. But as the number of guesses increases, the algorithm makes the game more difficult. This has created an energy arms race.The mines\u2019 scale can draw gasps from people in the power industry. A 1-megawatt mine consumes more energy each day than a typical U.S. home does in two years. The electricity coursing through a 100-megawatt operation at a given moment could power about half the homes in Cleveland, according to federal data.Aspects of the industry have previously been reported in news articles and government and nonprofit white papers, including broad estimates of the environmental effects. But the Times cross-referenced financial disclosures, land records and satellite imagery to create the first national accounting of the biggest operations. The analysis includes mines operating at approximately 40 megawatts or higher, although dozens more exist below that threshold.Of course, other industries, including metals and plastics manufacturing, also require large amounts of electricity, causing pollution and raising power prices. But bitcoin mines bring significantly fewer jobs, often employing only a few dozen people once construction is complete, and spur less local economic development.Their financial benefit flows almost exclusively to their owners and operators. In 2021, the year that bitcoin\u2019s price peaked, 20 executives at five publicly traded bitcoin companies together received nearly $16 million in salary and more than $630 million in stock options, records show.The industry has been less profitable since then, as bitcoin\u2019s value has dropped and electricity prices have climbed. Two of the largest United States-based companies have filed for bankruptcy. Still, new mines continue to open across the countryThere are ways to operate a cryptocurrency using far less electricity. Last year, ethereum, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, reduced the electricity needed to power the network by more than 99% by switching its algorithm. Now it rewards people and trusts them to update the ledger because they are willing to put up their own money as collateral, not because they have spent money to power guessing computers, as bitcoin does.But bitcoin advocates oppose changing their algorithm, saying it has proved resistant to attacks for longer and at a greater scale than any other approach. In practice, they say, the more computers making guesses, the safer the network.As bitcoin mining has spread, countries around the world have found that operations strained their power grids. In 2019, China declared the industry \u201cundesirable\u201d and banned it in 2021. Many operations moved to Iran and Kazakhstan, which also enacted restrictions.And shipping pallets piled high with bitcoin-mining computers started arriving in America, where some states welcomed them in.Just north of Jamestown, North Dakota, the land is flat, trees are scarce and, in winter, snowdrifts can easily top 10 feet. Even when brisk prairie winds blow, the shrill whine of the fans within Applied Digital\u2019s bitcoin mine can be heard a half-mile away.They are working to cool more than 30,000 computers, stacked two stories high, stretching for hundreds of feet alongside signs that read \u201cDanger \u2014 High Voltage.\u201d The radiating heat melts the snow on one side of each of the operation\u2019s eight buildings.The mine has 33 employees and uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as all the homes in the town of 16,000 people. It is one of three mines in the state that together consume nearly as much power as every home in North Dakota.Few other states have been as welcoming to bitcoin companies. In October 2021, Gov. Doug Burgum presented an economic development award to local officials and a power provider for bringing a mine to Grand Forks. Months later, he announced the development of a $1.9 billion bitcoin operation in Williston. And last spring, he flipped a switch at the Jamestown mine\u2019s ribbon-cutting ceremony.The bitcoin operations\u2019 effect on the state\u2019s economy is simple, said Josh Teigen, the commerce commissioner: \u201cThey are propping up our fossil fuel industry, and that\u2019s exactly what we want.\u201dNorth Dakota has an abundance of lignite, a type of coal primarily used to generate electricity. Teigen said the state hopes to ultimately capture the carbon from fossil fuel power plants and store it underground, reducing emissions while keeping the coal industry alive.The state also has a large amount of wind power, which is what attracted Applied Digital, said CEO Wes Cummins.His company is not alone. Many bitcoin businesses promote their ability to operate in rural areas where renewable energy is abundant.But those claims have hit a hard reality: A vast majority of that renewable energy would be used even in the absence of the mines, so fossil fuel plants almost always need to produce additional electricity as a result of their operations.For example, the Jamestown mine\u2019s power demand causes coal or natural gas energy providers to generate electricity more than 90% of the time, WattTime found.Using a technique known as marginal emissions analysis, WattTime examined each mine\u2019s location and power use, identified which types of power plants had generated the additional energy needed, and estimated the resulting pollution. That method, and WattTime in particular, were recommended in a report by the Crypto Climate Accord, an initiative to reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint supported by more than 200 cryptocurrency companies.The analysis found that the 34 mines\u2019 power use was causing nearly 16.4 million tons of carbon pollution each year.\u201cI\u2019m very surprised,\u201d Cummins said, when told the estimates for Applied Digital\u2019s Jamestown operation. He said his operation uses the electricity that is available on the grid and cannot control whether it comes from clean or dirty sources, which is affected by all customers\u2019 demand. The miners generally prefer calculating emissions based on that mix of power.Using that method, WattTime estimated that they consume 54% fossil fuel-generated power, resulting in nearly 10.4 million tons of carbon.Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, a bitcoin lobbying group, said in an email that the industry incentivizes the development of new renewable and natural gas plants. But power industry experts say that although some current wind farms may be benefiting modestly, renewable generation takes years to build and usually requires commitments from customers who can guarantee that they will buy power for a decade or more.According to Jenkins at Princeton, the bitcoin operations\u2019 near-constant power demand is more likely to keep fossil fuel plants in business than to lead to more renewable energy.This proved true in upstate New York, where a gas-powered plant reopened and now powers a bitcoin mine. Three other large operations are run by companies that also own the fossil fuel plants where they operate, including two burning waste coal in Pennsylvania.Some of the bitcoin companies that WattTime found to be causing the most pollution have held themselves out as supporting renewables.For example, Riot Platforms\u2019 CEO described bitcoin mining as \u201cuniquely beneficial and supportive of renewable energy.\u201d Ninety-six percent of the power demand added by the company\u2019s mine was met by fossil fuels, the WattTime analysis showed.Mining bitcoin produces steady revenue, but using so much electricity can also be a business model.Moments of extreme weather provide especially stark examples. Take June 23, 2022 \u2014 the eighth-straight day of near-100-degree temperatures around Austin, which allowed Riot Platforms to demonstrate several ways they can turn electricity into money.Like many industrial buyers, the company had prepurchased its power at a fraction of the price available to residential customers. Riot\u2019s mine runs at 450 megawatts \u2014 the largest in the country.Each day that June, its computers\u2019 guesses were winning bitcoin worth an average of about $342,000. But the company had two additional ways to improve its profit margins.First, it had signed up for the Responsive Reserve Service, a Texas power grid program that offers a way to quickly reduce strain if the grid becomes overloaded, acting as insurance against blackouts. The program pays miners, and other companies, for promising to stop using electricity upon request. In reality, they are rarely asked to shut down but are still paid for making the pledge.From midnight to nearly 4 p.m. on June 23, Riot earned more than $42,000 from the program while continuing to mine bitcoin. (Overall in 2022, Riot made nearly $9.3 million from participating in the program nearly 85% of the time, the data shows, although the grid operator asked companies to actually lower their use for about 3.5 hours.)About that time, the company switched to the second technique: avoiding fees that Texas charges to maintain and strengthen the power grid. It did so by briefly shutting off almost completely.To incentivize big customers to conserve electricity, those fees are based on how much electricity they use during several peak summer moments. Riot reduced its power use by more than 99%.By 6:30 p.m., the company had resumed mining. If Riot had been fully operating all day, it would have incurred an estimated $5.5 million in fees \u2014 costs that are largely made up by other Texans. Over the course of the year, this saved Riot more than $27 million in potential fees.The company\u2019s actions were described in data published by the Texas grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT. Although the records refer to power suppliers by pseudonyms, the Times was able to identify six of the 10 Texas operations in the data.One final mechanism lets some companies make extra money when electricity prices spike: They can stop mining and resell electricity to other customers. That earned Riot roughly $18 million last year.From bitcoin mining, the company earned $156.9 million last year.Five of the six Texas mines in the power grid data participate in the Responsive Reserve program. All six chose to turn off nearly every time fees were assessed in 2022, saving an estimated $62 million in fees.Asked whether bitcoin companies are disproportionately able to take advantage of both programs, ERCOT said in a statement that it \u201cdoes not discriminate based on the type or activity\u201d of the companies that sign up.It is not unusual for companies in Texas to be able to anticipate moments when fees will be assessed and to reduce their demand, but unlike bitcoin miners, most can stop using on average 5% to 30% of their electricity, industry consultants say.In a statement, Riot said its reducing its power load helped all power customers.\u201cThe company\u2019s decision to actively reduce its load during anticipated times of peak demand adds to grid reliability and ultimately helps to reduce peak power prices,\u201d the statement said.Bratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council said the benefits outweigh the cost.\u201cIn addition to providing jobs and positive economic impact, bitcoin miners turn off when power prices rise and that power is then available for commercial and residential users,\u201d he said.Others say the companies are capitalizing on weaknesses in programs designed for very different industries.\u201cI think they\u2019re exploiting the system,\u201d said Severin Bornstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies electricity pricing. \u201cBut they will say, \u2018You know, the system was already there,\u2019 and I\u2019m sympathetic to that in some ways.\u201dAfter accounting for the savings and revenue from each of the strategies, Riot told investors that its electricity cost in 2022 was 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour.By comparison, the average price for other industrial businesses in Texas was 7.2 cents. For residents, it was 13.5 cents.These opportunities have led some of the country\u2019s largest bitcoin operations to choose Texas.\u201cIt\u2019s a massive financial burden to Texans,\u201d said Ben Hertz-Shargel, who leads grid-related research at Wood Mackenzie, and was part of the team that conducted the market-based simulation for the Times based on historical ERCOT data. Because of how the Texas market operates, the increases are steepest for residential customers, said Hertz-Shargel, who has previously criticized bitcoin\u2019s dependence on electricity as \u201cinessential.\u201dOthers say increased prices will incentivize the development of cheaper types of power generation.\u201cExpanding Texas generation is crucial, and allowing different energy sources to compete in the market will help drive down prices,\u201d said Gideon Powell, CEO at Cholla, an energy exploration company in Texas that is developing bitcoin mines.As of last month, ERCOT had approved plans to connect an additional 4,000 megawatts of bitcoin operations this year, which would nearly triple their consumption in Texas.In Congress, Democrats have called for a precise inventory of operations\u2019 power use and resulting emissions. Republicans have largely supported the industry, including by introducing a congressional resolution last month affirming its importance to the country\u2019s energy goals and economy.In Texas, the companies have powerful allies. Gov. Greg Abbott said in a tweet that \u201cTexas will be the crypto leader\u201d and hosted the Texas Blockchain Council at the governor\u2019s mansion. The grid\u2019s former interim CEO declared himself \u201cpro bitcoin,\u201d and the current vice chair of the grid\u2019s board is a former adviser to the Texas Blockchain Council. Still, in March, three Republican state senators joined in sponsoring a bill that would restrict tax breaks for miners and place strict limits on their participation in programs such as the Responsive Reserve.In Rockdale, where two of the largest mines in the country operate just outside the city limits, the city manager, Barbara Holly, told the Times that the town used to be \u201ca fairly wealthy little community.\u201d She said that changed when a large industrial plant that had provided thousands of jobs closed more than a decade ago. \u201cIt just cut the legs out from under this community,\u201d she said.It was the old aluminum smelter, now home to the Bitdeer mine."

Conversely, persistent inflationary forces could lead traders to bet on more interest rate hikes in May.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise above $29,000 suggest that crypto traders have been pricing in a drop in inflation, which, in turn, could lead to a potential Fed pivot.\n\nNonetheless, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback\u2019s strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, climbed 0.7% on April 10, which, alongside a weaker U.S. stock market, shows macro investors see a rate hike ahead.\n\nDXY daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn fact, the market sees a 70% probability of the Fed lifting rates by 25 basis points at its meeting in May, according to the CME Fed Watch Tool. That could be due to a tightening labor market that gives the Fed more ammunition to continue raising lending rates in the future.\n\nCould Bitcoin hit $30,000 in April?\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Bitcoin looks prepared to hit $30,000 ahead of the Fed FOMC. However, its likelihood of holding those gains will depend on the inflation data, as mentioned above.\n\nRelated: CPI to spark dollar \u2018massacre\u2019 \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nMeanwhile, from a technical analysis standpoint, Bitcoin must close above its weekly resistance range \u2014 defined by the $29,500 to $32,000 area \u2014 to eye a run-up toward $40,000.\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Coinbase, and Riot Platforms Are Moving Higher Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe price of several cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks moved higher today for no obvious reason, but as investors prepared for new economic data and for earnings season to kick off later this week.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 0.49%), traded 3.8% higher as of 3:37 p.m. ET today.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of the large crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN -1.72%) traded 5.5% higher during normal trading hours, while shares of the Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%) traded nearly 15% higher.\n\nSo what\n\nBecause the markets were closed Friday, the market didn't get to react to the March jobs report until today. The U.S. economy added 236,000 jobs in March, which does represent a slowdown in hiring and was in line with estimates. However, the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5% as the labor force participation rate increased.\n\nStill, that's a healthy month of hiring, and following the report traders increased their bets that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates at its May meeting. Rising interest rates crushed Bitcoin in 2022.\n\nYet in another report that came out today from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consumers said that accessing credit in March got more difficult and is the toughest it's been since 2014. Since the banking crisis started, banks have been expected to tighten credit, which could chill the economy and potentially even trigger a recession. This might entice the Fed to cut interest rates, which has historically been good for riskier assets like Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, analysts from Bernstein in a research note today said that investors' rising interest in gold should also lead to a rise in interest in Bitcoin. The analysts said they see more investors expecting a hard landing for the economy, which will trigger rate cuts and a weakening dollar, which has led them to start favoring gold as a hedge.\n\n\"When there is a massive monetary debasement event, while both Bitcoin and Gold rally, Bitcoin outperforms Gold,\" the analysts wrote. \"For example, post-Covid monetary printing, Bitcoin outperformed Gold (2.9x over ~3.5 years). In fact, even this year, since the banking crisis fears have escalated, Bitcoin rallied ~71% YTD vs. Gold rallying ~10% YTD.\"\n\nWhen Bitcoin trades up other crypto stocks tend to follow. Coinbase benefits when there is increased trading activity in cryptocurrencies, while Riot benefits because the asset that the company mines, Bitcoin, is increasing in value.\n\nNow what\n\nI think the economic data has been somewhat conflicting recently. Traders have been penciling in rate cuts this year, which would likely favor Bitcoin and crypto, but the Friday jobs report also hints that inflation hasn't been tamed yet. The Fed is now expected to do another quarter-point hike at its May meeting.\n\nStill, there will be new key inflation data out Wednesday, and then bank earnings kick off Friday. Both of these events could still change the trajectory of the Fed, so you'll want to keep an eye on them.\n\nWhile I expect volatility, I do think Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency worth having at least a little bit of exposure to, and I would expect Bitcoin to benefit from a weakening dollar or a rate cut. Currently, I am not interested in Coinbase or Riot because of the enhanced regulatory environment around crypto companies, although both will likely benefit if Bitcoin rises. I just prefer Bitcoin."

        "title": "What is a crypto dusting attack, and how do you avoid it? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "What is crypto dust? Crypto dust is small amounts of cryptocurrency sent to a large number of wallet addresses with benevolent or malicious purposes. Generally, dust is considered the amount of cryptocurrency equal to or lower than a transaction fee. Bitcoin, for example, has a dust limit imposed by Bitcoin Core, the Bitcoin blockchain software, of around 546 satoshis (0.00000546 BTC), the smaller denomination of Bitcoin (BTC). The wallets\u2019 nodes that apply such a limit may reject transactions equal to or smaller than 546 satoshis. Dust could also be the small amount of cryptocurrency that remains after a trade as a result of rounding errors or transaction fees and can accumulate over time. That small amount is not tradeable but can be converted into the exchange\u2019s native token. Crypto dust should not pose a significant threat, as it has mainly been used for legitimate rather than malicious purposes. For example, reaching out to wallet holders via dusting can be an alternative advertising method to more traditional mailshots. The dust transactions can contain promotional messages, so dusting is used instead of mailshots. Despite not being a major concern, crypto users should still know what a dust attack is and take measures to protect themselves should it occur.\n\nWhat is a crypto dusting attack? A dusting attack occurs when small amounts of crypto assets, called dust, are sent by malicious actors to multiple wallet addresses \u2014 just like dust \u2014 scattered across blockchain networks. Blockchain technology is pseudonymous, meaning that owners of a cryptocurrency address are not defined by their names or any other personal data. However, the blockchain ledger is transparent and traceable; thus, all transactions are visible to everyone, and a user\u2019s activity can be tracked down following the history of that specific address. When attackers transfer dust to cryptocurrency wallets, they want to invade the privacy of their owners by tracking down their funds when they move them from one address to another. The attacker\u2019s goal is not to steal cryptocurrency \u2014 as simple dusting won\u2019t allow it \u2014 but rather associate the target\u2019s address with other addresses that may lead to identifying the victim through off-blockchain hacking activity. A crypto dusting attack can occur in most public blockchains, including Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin. A dusting attack aims to link the attacked addresses and wallets to the personal data of their related companies or individuals and use this knowledge against their targets, either through elaborate phishing scams, cyberextortion threats, blackmail or identity theft to make a profit.\n\nAre all dusting attacks crypto scams? Not all the crypto dust transferred to a crypto wallet\u2019s address is a scam. Dusting can be used for reasons besides hacking activities. A dusting technique may be used by governments to link a specific cryptocurrency address to an individual or an organization and identify a series of criminal activities, including money laundering, tax evasion, terrorist threats, etc., or to ensure regulatory compliance and safety. Developers may also use dusting to conduct their software\u2019s stress tests, a software testing activity extended beyond limits to determine the robustness of the software and other functionalities like transaction processing speed, network scalability and security protocols. This can help identify potential issues and vulnerabilities in the software, allowing developers to improve its performance and security. Crypto traders tend to receive dust as a result of trades, and it\u2019s not considered an attack. Many exchanges offer customers the chance to swap these small amounts of cryptocurrency for their native tokens to use in future trades or another cryptocurrency with a low transaction fee.\n\nHow does a dusting attack work? Malicious actors rely on the fact that cryptocurrency users don\u2019t even realize they received tiny amounts of cryptocurrencies in their wallet addresses. Of the way blockchains work, with their transparency and traceability, it is possible to track down transaction movements that may lead to the identification of wallet owners. For a dust attack to be effective, the owner of the wallet must combine the crypto dust with other funds in the same wallet and use it for other transactions. By including a small amount of cryptocurrency in other transactions, the target of the attack may inadvertently and unknowingly send the dust to an off-blockchain centralized organization. As the centralized platform must comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, it will store the personal data of the victim, who may become vulnerable to phishing, cyberextortion threats, blackmailing and other targeted hacks off the blockchain aimed at stealing sensitive information. The cryptocurrency addresses that are more vulnerable to dusting attacks are the UTXO-based addresses used in various blockchains, mainly Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dash, because they all generate a new address for each change remaining from transactions. UTXO prevents double-spending and is an unspent transaction output that remains after a transaction is executed and can be used as input on another transaction. It\u2019s like the change we receive from a merchant when we spend $9.59, for example, after giving a $10 bill. Just like that tiny change can be used in other money transactions later, the crypto dust from multiple addresses can be spent in other transactions. By detecting the origins of funds from the dust attack transaction, the attackers can use advanced technological tools to trace a thread to determine the victim\u2019s identity.\n\nCan dusting attacks steal crypto? A traditional dusting attack cannot be used to access users\u2019 money and steal their crypto assets. However, hackers\u2019 increasingly sophisticated tools can trick wallet holders into phishing sites and drain their funds. A traditional dusting attack is used to identify the individuals or groups behind the wallets, deanonymize them, and break their privacy and identity. Such activities cannot steal cryptocurrency directly but are aimed at detecting victims\u2019 social activities \u2014 tracked down through the combination of different addresses \u2014 to then blackmail them, for example. Over time and with the technology\u2019s new use cases, such as nonfungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi), attackers have become more sophisticated and have learned to disguise scam tokens as airdrops of free cryptocurrency. The wallet holders can access these appealing free tokens by claiming them from popular NFT projects on phishing sites created by hackers that seem legitimate. Such sites are so similar to the authentic ones that it\u2019s difficult for the average cryptocurrency enthusiast to differentiate one from another. The phishing sites won\u2019t steal usernames and passwords but will convince the victim to connect their wallet to the malicious sites. By granting these phishing sites permission to access their wallets, the unknowing victim enables the hacker to move their funds and NFT assets to their wallets, stealing crypto using harmful lines of code in smart contracts. Increasingly, dusting attacks occur on browser-based wallets like MetaMask and the Trust wallet, which are primarily used as a getaway to decentralized applications (DApps) and Web3 services. Browser-based wallets are particularly vulnerable to dusting attacks because they are more accessible to the public and can be more easily targeted by hackers or scammers.\n\nHow to identify crypto dust attacks? A clear indicator of a dusting attack in a wallet is the sudden appearance of small amounts of extra cryptocurrency unsuitable for spending or withdrawing. The dusting attack transaction will appear in a wallet\u2019s transaction history, so verifying if any malicious dusting deposits occurred should be easy. Concerning how cryptocurrency exchanges operate and comply with KYC and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, they will store their customers\u2019 data, making them a possible target of cryptocurrency scams. In October 2020, Binance suffered a dusting attack with small amounts of BNB (BNB) sent to multiple wallets. Once the victim sent the dust in combination with other funds, they received a transaction confirmation with a malware link with an offer that would trick the victim into clicking on it and becoming unknowingly hacked. Following a dusting attack, a cryptocurrency provider, like an exchange or a wallet, is usually encouraged to take strict measures to prevent future episodes. In late 2018, the Samourai Wallet developers warned some of their users that they were experiencing a dusting attack and asked them to mark UTXO as \u201cDo Not Spend\u201d to tackle the issue. A real-time dust-tracking alert and an easy-to-use feature to mark suspicious funds with a \u201cDo Not Spend\u201d note were soon implemented by the wallet\u2019s developers team to help users better protect their transactions against future attacks."

While traders want to see inflation receding faster than expected, the Fed itself remains hawkish, last month confirming that further interest rate hikes may be appropriate.\n\nHowever, a divergence between the Fed and markets is equally evident, with sentiment beginning to show that the latter simply does not believe rate hikes will continue much longer.\n\nAccording to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool, next month\u2019s FOMC meeting will likely end in a repeat 0.25% hike. Those odds are highly flexible and react immediately to any new macro data releases, CPI included.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart.

        "content": "Beijing-based cryptocurrency mining firm Bitmain has reportedly violated tax regulations in China, with local authorities imposing major fines.\n\nBitmain Technologies has been slapped with a tax penalty from the Beijing Municipal Office of the State Administration of Taxation, the local news agency Sina Finance reported on April 11.\n\nThe authority fined Bitmain about 25 million Chinese yuan ($3.7 million), the report notes, citing details from China\u2019s data registry of private and public companies, Qichacha.\n\nAccording to the data, Bitmain was penalized on April 4, 2023, with the firm allegedly failing to pay personal income taxes in accordance with China\u2019s laws on the administration of tax collection. The statement specifically referred to certain violations related to taxes on the income from Bitmain employees\u2019 salaries, bonuses, labor dividends, allowances and more.\n\nThe tax authority also mentioned that tax inspectors delivered notice on certain tax violations to Bitmain in August 2022. So far, Bitmain\u2019s Beijing unit has failed to pay personal income tax totaling 16.6 million yuan, or $2.4 million.\n\nFounded in 2013, Bitmain is one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency mining companies, widely known for manufacturing crypto mining-specific hardware and solutions. The company was reportedly forced to stop its business in China in October 2021 in response to a blanket ban on crypto imposed by the Chinese government in September 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the firm has been running its operations since. Bitmain did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin proponents respond to New York Times\u2019 BTC mining report\n\nDespite regulatory uncertainty and a major bear crypto market in 2022, Bitmain\u2019s business has continued to see success. In December 2022, Bitmain\u2019s latest Antminer device reportedly sold out in less than a minute despite tanking mining profitability.\n\nIn September 2022, Bitmain founder Jihan Wu set up a $250 million fund to support the mining industry affected by the prolonged cryptocurrency winter. After leaving Bitmain in 2021, Wu founded Bitdeer, a new crypto mining firm and a spin-off of Bitmain.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: US and China try to crush Binance, SBF\u2019s $40M bribe claim"

        "content": "Billionaire Ray Dalio is one of the world\u2019s richest people who have started out as critics of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), only to end up investing in them, which is why many wonder how much of that digital asset the retired founder of the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund truly has.\n\nIndeed, the author of the personal investment book \u2018Principles: Life and Work\u2019 used to be hesitant about Bitcoin, arguing it was \u201cnot very good as a store-hold of wealth because its volatility is great and has little correlation with the prices of what I need to buy,\u201d back in November 2020.\n\nOn top of that, he did not see a future in which \u201ccentral banks, big institutional investors, businesses, or multinational companies [are] using it,\u201d but at the same time, he opened himself up to the possibility of being proven wrong, as Finbold reported at the time.\n\nChange in stance\n\nHowever, only a month later, in December 2020, Dalio appeared to have changed his stand on the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, stating in a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) session that Bitcoin could serve as a \u201cgold diversifier\u201d and a store hold of wealth in the future.\n\nIn May 2021, he revealed that he owned \u201csome Bitcoin\u201d during CoinDesk\u2019s 2021 Consensus conference. One year later, the billionaire investor reiterated his position that Bitcoin had made \u201ctremendous achievements over the last decade,\u201d emerging as an alternative to gold, which is why he included some of it in his investment portfolio, albeit only \u201ca tiny percentage.\u201d\n\n1% or 2% of portfolio\n\nAlthough it is not clear how much this \u2018tiny percentage\u2019 is, in January 2022, Dalio told William Green, the co-host of the We Study Billionaires podcast, that allocating 1% to 2% of one\u2019s portfolio to Bitcoin was reasonable, which means he himself might have the same percentage of his wealth invested in Bitcoin, with his net worth currently standing at roughly $19 billion.\n\nAccording to hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, Ray Dalio is an example of a \u201cbrilliant guy\u201d who has \u201cdone the homework\u201d on Bitcoin, observing how he used to be \u201ca Bitcoin skeptic\u201d and was \u201cnow a Bitcoin investor,\u201d as Finbold reported in October 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at the price of $30,067, recording an increase of 6.09% on the day, adding up to the 8.09% accumulated over the past week and the 46.51% gain on its monthly chart, as per the latest data retrieved by Finbold on April 11.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "At 19:27 Eastern time on April 12, the Ethereum blockchain, home to the world\u2019s second-most-popular cryptocurrency, ether, will finally sever its links to crypto mining. Within the Ethereum bubble, a sense of anticipation is building; some are planning \u201cviewing parties\u201d for the occasion. Codenamed \u201cShanghai,\u201d the update to Ethereum caps off a process, after \u201cThe Merge,\u201d which fundamentally changes the way transactions are verified and the network secured.\n\nUnder the old system, proof-of-work (PoW) mining, the right to process a batch of transactions and earn a crypto reward is determined by a race to solve a mathematical puzzle. The greater the computing power miners throw at the problem, the greater their chance of winning the race. Under Ethereum\u2019s new proof-of-stake (PoS) system, there is no race and there are no miners; instead, the winner is determined by raffle. The greater the amount of ether somebody locks up on the network\u2014or stakes\u2014the greater the chance they hold a prize-winning ticket.\n\nBy demonstrating that a large-scale blockchain can shift from one system to another, Shanghai will reignite a debate over whether the practice of mining that still supports bitcoin, the most widely traded cryptocurrency, is viable and sustainable. Figures from the University of Cambridge suggest the Bitcoin network consumed 107 terawatt-hours of energy in 2022\u2014equivalent to that of the Netherlands\u2014of which only just over a quarter came from renewable sources. Prior to The Merge, Ethereum consumed roughly two-thirds as much energy as the Bitcoin network. But the move away from mining has cut that consumption, according to analysis by Alex de Vries, data scientist at De Nederlandsche Bank and creator of Digiconomist, a source of crypto emissions data, by at least 99.84 percent.\n\n\u201cThe energy consumption problem is Bitcoin\u2019s achilles heel,\u201d says de Vries. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple fact that as the price of bitcoin gets higher, the energy consumption problem gets worse. The more money miners make, the more they will typically spend on resources: hardware and electricity.\n\nBut many bitcoiners dispute the characterization of the network as energy-guzzling and carbon intensive, saying that mining is increasingly powered by renewable energy. And, they say, PoS is inferior to PoW\u2014prone to centralization (crypto\u2019s great nemesis), concentrating influence and wealth in the hands of the wealthy, without any mitigating forces, like energy costs, pulling in the opposite direction. All of this makes Shanghai a proxy battle over the future of crypto.\n\nIn bitcoin\u2019s infancy, the cryptocurrency could be mined effectively with just a personal computer and simple software. But as the level of appetite for bitcoin increased, the industry professionalized. Today, the mining scene is dominated by large companies\u2014some publicly traded, like Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain\u2014that operate gargantuan facilities with rack upon rack of hardware. The largest of these mines, many of which are located in Texas, can draw upwards of 700 MW of power."

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, April 11, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today announced a purchase of 45,000 brand-new units of the Antminer S19 XP bitcoin mining machines for a total price of $144.9 million.\n\nAll units are expected to be ready for delivery by the manufacturer before September end, adding, once deployed, over 6.3 exahashes per second (EH/s) of computing power to the company\u2019s current hashrate of 6.7 EH/s, a 95% increase.\n\n\u201cThe Antminer S19 XP is the most power-efficient bitcoin mining machine available in the market today, and a key component in our continuing work to build some of the most efficient bitcoin mining facilities in the country,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark. \u201cAs bitcoin\u2019s halving draws closer, our focus on operational efficiency, our technical expertise, and our treasury management strategy, will all play a crucial role in solidifying CleanSpark\u2019s position among the top bitcoin mining companies in America.\u201d\n\nAccording to the purchase agreement, the manufacturer will prepare 25,000 of the 45,000 units for delivery in August, while the remaining 20,000 units are expected to be ready for delivery in September. The Company plans to deploy all of the acquired units at its bitcoin mining facility in Sandersville, Georgia, which is currently undergoing a planned 150 megawatts (MW) expansion. The machines will be deployed in multiple batches as they arrive on site and new rack-space becomes available, with all machines expected to be fully operational before year-end.\n\n\u201cThis bear market,\u201d Bradford continued, \u201chas continued to provide us with opportunities to maximize ROI including the opportunity to purchase the industry\u2019s best miner at an industry leading price. We have chosen other units such as the S19 jPro+ over the S19 XP in the past because we believed the gap would close on the delta between the ROI of other units and the XP. Our patience has paid off. Securing these units under contract provides us with approximately 15.9 EH/s of machines on hand or under contract for delivery this year. This is an important step toward our target of 16 EH/s by year end. With approximately 99% of the required servers secured, we have addressed a key variable and can turn our full attention to the build-out of infrastructure at our campuses.\u201d\n\nThis most recent miner purchase is in addition to a 20,000 machine purchase announced in February. Those machines are fully paid for and in the process of being delivered to the Company\u2019s Washington facility. They are expected to be energized later this quarter, adding an additional 2.44 EH/s of machines to CleanSpark\u2019s operational hashrate.\n\n\u201cIn addition to securing the majority of ASICs needed to reach our guidance, this deal demonstrates, yet again, our ability to make timely purchases based on ROI metrics,\u201d said Gary Vecchiarelli, CleanSpark\u2019s CFO. \u201cThat ability is premised on a capital strategy which maintains flexibility as its core tenant and allows us to capitalize on accretive opportunities, such as this transaction, in the marketplace. Securing XPs at these prices means we have one less variable in our capital expenditure equation and puts us well on our way to achieving our year end guidance of 16 EH/s.\u201d\n\nCleanSpark mines bitcoin predominantly with low-carbon energy sources, which account for over 90% of its energy mix, and continues to follow a balanced capital management strategy by selling a portion of its mined bitcoins to reinvest in growth. This strategy, coupled with the Company\u2019s proprietary mining model, has allowed CleanSpark to achieve one of the highest hashrate realization rates among its peers since January 2022.\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (Nasdaq: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122. Since 2014, we\u2019ve helped people achieve energy independence for their homes and businesses. In 2020, we transitioned that expertise to develop sustainable infrastructure for Bitcoin, an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter a year of quiet, the well-funded Bitcoin tech infrastructure company Lightspark, founded in 2022, has unveiled a platform for Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network aimed at onboarding businesses to the network.\n\nLightspark is led by former Paypal president and entrepreneur David Marcus, who co-created Diem, a Facebook cryptocurrency product that failed to take flight after arousing the suspicions of US regulators. Lightspark's announcement on Twitter calls the new Lightspark Platform \"the first enterprise-grade entry point to the Lightning Network.\"\n\nThe Lightning Network speeds up Bitcoin transactions and is often trumpeted as providing a missing piece from Bitcoin that will push the digital currency mainstream.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut so far, Lightning products have been hard for people outside of Bitcoin to wrap their heads around. Lightsparks' goal is to make it easier for enterprises to absorb.\n\nToday we\u2019re launching the Lightspark Platform. The first enterprise-grade entry point to the Lightning Network. We believe Lightning will be the winning open payment protocol on the Internet. Head to https://t.co/xMo8BjNRqu to get started. pic.twitter.com/Zv8xeqp3Il \u2014 Lightspark (@lightspark) April 11, 2023\n\nTo that end, Marcus tweeted a bold claim: \"Today, the complexity and steep learning curve inherent to Lightning are gone.\n\n\"It's now intuitive and easy to reliably send and receive payments on the network or to build payment experiences without any of the constraints of antiquated rails,\" he wrote. \"Hello, streaming money!\"\n\nLightspark joins a chorus of other Bitcoin companies and open-source developers focused on bringing the advantages of Lightning to a wider audience, since Lightning is an open protocol that makes global payments faster, cheaper, and gives users more control than traditional digital payment systems.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast month, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced the roadmap for Spiral, which is developing a payment processing layer for the Lightning Network. In October, Bitcoin-focused startup ZEBEDEE launched an open-source initiative for the network.\n\n\"We believe the Internet badly needs an open payment protocol\u2014one that works 24/7, settles in near real-time, is dirt cheap, interoperable, and open to all to build on,\" Marcus said. \"Money should move online like emails or text messages, and the Lightning Network has the best chance of becoming the standard protocol that enables that and much more for everyone around the world.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin and Altcoins Report \u2013 April Week 2 - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Bitcoin continues to trade sideways at the April 10 Wall Street open, but many are betting on a potential impending breakout. Following a recent surge that led to BTC/USD\u2019s highest weekly closure since June 2022, there is renewed confidence that Bitcoin may soon surpass the $30,000 mark.\n\nLet\u2019s see what\u2019s going on in the Bitcoin and altcoins market this week.\n\nA Volatile Week Ahead!\n\nOver the past week (first week of April 2023), Bitcoin and altcoins have remained relatively stable. However, the SushiSwap hack added some drama to the crypto market, highlighting the industry\u2019s frequency of hacks and exploits.\n\nThe second week of April promises to be eventful, with Wednesday being particularly busy as Ethereum completes its Shapella upgrade, allowing for ETH unstaking by validators.\n\nMoreover, it coincides with the publication of the CPI for March and the Fed\u2019s minutes from its March meeting. Additionally, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will transition some of its futures contracts to a new interest rate on Friday.\n\nThe Aftermath?\n\nThe impact of ETH unstaking on the cryptocurrency market and ETH itself remains uncertain. One possible outcome is that the successful implementation of the Shapella upgrade could boost institutional investor confidence in ETH, resulting in increased buying and a rise in ETH\u2019s value.\n\nHowever, there is also the potential for significant sell pressure from unstaked ETH, which could lead to a sharp decline in ETH\u2019s value. In fact, this initial sell pressure could amount to over $2 billion USD.\n\nMoreover, there is a risk that the SEC might consider ETH a security after the upgrade. Former SEC director Bill Hinman previously deemed ETH as not a security due to its \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d nature; however, this determination was when ETH was still a proof-of-work asset.\n\nAlthough it is still technically a proof-of-work asset, this could change once unstaking is allowed. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has stated that proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies are considered securities. Thus, there is a possibility that the SEC may reclassify ETH as a security, which could have significant implications for the crypto market.\n\nWhat About the CPI?\n\nRegarding the CPI print for March, the core CPI number, not just the headline number, will be crucial as it seems to be getting stuck at just over 5%. A crash could happen if either headline or core CPI stays the same or suddenly increases. Alternatively, a rally might occur if either headline or core CPI suddenly decreases.\n\nBesides, the Fed\u2019s minutes from the March meeting will reveal whether Fed officials are nervous about financial stability or still focused on inflation. It is particularly significant as the meeting occurred just days before the banking crisis began.\n\nIf the minutes indicate that officials are becoming increasingly nervous about financial stability, it could have a bullish effect. Conversely, if the focus remains primarily on inflation, it could have a bearish impact on the market.\n\nFinally, the CME\u2019s interest rate switch is also something to watch. As the world\u2019s largest futures exchange, the CME will transition its futures contracts from the LIBOR rate to the SOFR rate starting Friday.\n\nThis change can cause market volatility, as noted by Fitch Ratings in 2021, and recent articles by the Financial Times suggest that this risk still exists. While we can only hope this transition will not result in a black swan event, it remains a concern.\n\nRising Volatility in the Price of Bitcoin\n\nTraders looking for volatility will have plenty of it, as per data from market data resource Kaiko. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is diverging from that of equities, with increasing action while the Nasdaq cools. Last month\u2019s events related to the U.S. banking crisis widened the gap between Bitcoin and Nasdaq 30-day rolling volatility, reaching the highest levels in a year.\n\nSource: Kaiko\n\nKaiko reported in the first week of April that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with gold had surpassed its correlation with the S&P 500. The gap is now even wider!\n\nSource: Kaiko\n\nAdditionally, the market data resource noted that Bitcoin\u2019s inverse correlation with the U.S. dollar is rapidly unwinding. While BTC is still negatively correlated with the U.S. dollar, the correlation has become almost negligible, dropping from -60% to -23% year-to-date.\n\nSource: Kaiko\n\nThese insights suggest that Bitcoin\u2019s relationship with traditional markets is shifting, and the crypto continues to take on a more safe-haven asset role.\n\nBull Run: A Long Way Off?\n\nDuring a price bottom, short-term holders typically benefit more, and the need for continued Bitcoin price growth depends on their behavior and profitability. Understanding the value held by Bitcoin holders based on realized price is a valuable way to determine their behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, long-term holders tend to hold their coins for extended periods and tolerate more loss.\n\nOften, profitable days for Bitcoin begin with the profitability of the short-term holders. As their profits increase, they become more interested in retaining their coins, leading to less selling pressure. As a result, short-term holders are currently more valuable.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nAccording to the given metric, when the realized price of the 1-6 months age band exceeds that of the 6-12 months age band, it indicates a scenario where new Bitcoin investors hold more value and profits in their holdings. Historical Bitcoin price cycles in 2015-2016 and 2018-2019 have shown that a bull run usually begins once this shift occurs following a price correction.\n\nHowever, the current situation is different, and this process may be more time-consuming. More new investors are needed to increase the value in the wallets of short-term holders and encourage them to adopt a long-term approach and prevent sell-offs. This conversion of short-term holders into long-term holders may take time and prolong the process of the BTC bull run.\n\nIs 100K BTC Possible?\n\nBitcoin has delivered impressive returns in 2023, rising by ~69% year-to-date. Interestingly, the correlation between $BTC and the technology-focused Nasdaq 100 index has decreased significantly, dropping from 0.75 in October to the current value of 0.3, indicating a weakening of their relationship.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nWe can analyze Bitcoin\u2019s market behavior through the lens of multi-year cycles comprising accumulation (turquoise) and distribution (purple) phases. Smart money (institutions) tends to favor accumulation cycles, while retail demand is more characteristic of distribution cycles.\n\nMoreover, halving events, preceded by accumulation cycles (turquoise) are crucial phases of the Bitcoin cycles. Before the start of a distribution cycle, there is often a spike in fees to reward on-chain data (yellow). This phenomenon occurred in 2019 and 2020, and it can help forecast the transition from an accumulation to a distribution cycle.\n\nDuring the accumulation cycle of 2019, the fees-to-reward ratio spiked before the summer relief rally (white arrow on the left), rising to 0.12. In 2020, the fees-to-reward ratio spiked again, reaching 0.21 in May and 0.29 in November.\n\nBesides, the fees-to-reward indicator appears to be spiking again (white arrow on the right). Additionally, Bitcoin is moving towards a previously predicted price model based on 2019 data, which forecasts a spot price level of $46,092.\n\nAccording to the model, Bitcoin should reach its target during the upcoming summer of 2023. However, the real target is the halving event of 2024, which represents a paradigm shift in the sequence of Bitcoin\u2019s market cycles.\n\nThe next halving event will most likely occur on April 29th, 2024, and it will increase the scarcity of Bitcoin by reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125. After reaching the 2019-based target price of $46,092, it is possible that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 following the 2024 halving event.\n\nMVRV Ratio and Insights\n\nThe Bitcoin MVRV ratio is a valuable tool for analyzing market trends by comparing the current market capitalization to the realized capitalization of the cryptocurrency. This metric has proven to be a reliable indicator of market behavior for three halvings.\n\nOne of the critical uses of the MVRV ratio is in identifying market trends. When market capitalization grows faster than realized capitalization, the MVRV ratio increases, which may indicate a higher probability of sell-offs.\n\nConversely, when the realized capitalization surpasses the market capitalization, the MVRV ratio decreases, implying a possible decline in selling pressure.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nAfter the COVID crisis, Bitcoin\u2019s MVRV turned green in April 2020, indicating values above 1, and continued to rise, reaching an all-time high above 3.75, marking Bitcoin\u2019s ATH.\n\nHowever, during the China ban, the MVRV dropped to 1.5 before recovering and hitting a lower high of 3. Then, MVRV started to descend and eventually broke the 1.5 level owing to negative narratives surrounding major crypto firms like Terra Luna, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, and FTX.\n\nIn November 2022, the MVRV ratio dropped below the 1 level, hitting a low of 0.75. However, in January 2023, there was a substantial increase in Bitcoin prices, driven by significant accumulation in both spot and derivatives markets. This surge was further supported by the record-breaking number of open interests in Bitcoin options, indicating a continued growth trend, and the MVRV ratio subsequently broke the 1 level upward.\n\nAnalysis of the MVRV ratio reveals the importance of the 1.5 level, and the question arises whether the ratio will surpass this level to sustain the upward trend. This scenario is highly likely as users rapidly withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges, leading to a scarce supply.\n\nInsights From Exchange Bitcoin Inflow and Outflow\n\nBefore we analyze Bitcoin inflow and outflow, let\u2019s first understand the basics of correlation analysis.\n\nCorrelation analysis is a statistical method that measures the direction and strength of the relationship between two variables. When two variables move in the same direction, it is referred to as a positive correlation, whereas if they move in opposite directions, it is a negative correlation.\n\nA correlation coefficient of 0.93 indicates a strong positive correlation between Bitcoin inflows to exchanges and Bitcoin outflows from exchanges. It means that as inflows increase, outflows also tend to increase. Besides, the high correlation coefficient suggests that these two metrics are closely linked, and we can use changes in one variable to anticipate changes in the other variable.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nWhen there is a significant increase in Bitcoin inflows to exchanges, it is likely that short-term holders are selling their bitcoins at high prices to secure profits, leading to downward pressure on prices and a rise in the short-term holders\u2019 Realized Price.\n\nOn the other hand, a substantial increase in Bitcoin outflows from exchanges, usually following a surge in BTC inflows as indicated by the correlation graph, may show a growing interest in holding the asset outside of exchanges, likely by long-term holders. This trend could contribute to a decrease in the Realized Price of long-term Holders.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThe takeaway?\n\nExpanding on the previous points, the movement of Bitcoin\u2019s price from a lower range of $27,500-$27,800 to above $28,000 may imply that long-term holders have taken advantage of the price dip and withdrawn their bitcoins from exchanges. This withdrawal of Bitcoin from exchanges reduces the available supply, leading to a price surge as demand may rise in the face of diminishing supply.\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin\u2019s price drops below the $28,000 level, it could suggest that short-term holders have sold their coins at prices ranging between $28,500 and $28,000, thereby increasing the available supply on exchanges. This rise in supply may add downward pressure on prices as demand may decrease in response to an ampler supply.\n\nWhales and Fund Flow\n\nThe fund flow measures the ratio of coin transfers involving exchanges to the total coin transfers across the network, indicating investor activity on exchanges. However, a pattern has emerged where fund flows increase and decrease, and then the Bitcoin price experiences a squeeze and bounces back up.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nA possible reason for this current pattern is due to whales deciding to launch an increase in fund flows, doing this by making active trades on exchanges in order to set a market bottom. It, in turn, led to increased demand from institutions and other over-the-counter (OTC) market participants because they perceived that the market had reached its bottom.\n\nIf these whales were successful in convincing OTC institutions to buy, we could expect to see a significant decline in fund flows and a further rise in the market, in line with past trends.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nConversations surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s sustainability often touch on how much power the network consumes. But the mere fact that its power consumption is a known factor is notable, according to Canadian Bitcoin miner Hut 8\u2019s CEO Jaime Leverton.\n\n\u201cWe see our energy use, really, as a feature of proof of work,\u201d she said, referencing the process by which Bitcoin transactions are verified on the latest episode of Decrypt\u2019s gm podcast.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCritics like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren have slammed Bitcoin mining as a contributor to the climate crisis. Bitcoin faithful like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor counter with the notion that miners give what would be wasted energy a new purpose, effectively storing it in cyberspace as Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin mining consumes roughly the same amount of electricity as Washington state\u2014putting pressure on our power grids and worsening the #ClimateCrisis. We need to protect our planet and crack down on environmentally wasteful crypto mining practices. https://t.co/ChKYcD82gH \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 7, 2021\n\nRegardless, the environmental footprint of Bitcoin mining has been well documented, in part because Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate is public. The measure captures the computational force being used across Bitcoin\u2019s network as miners race to solve Bitcoin\u2019s next block by continuously crunching complex calculations.\n\nLeverton said that having this competition play out in front of everyone\u2019s eyes creates a degree of transparency innate to Bitcoin mining\u2014one that isn\u2019t shared by the traditional financial system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to see how much energy is used by Bitcoin miners because it\u2019s publicly available information,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas, you can\u2019t see how much energy is used by the traditional fiat banking system or by hard metal mining.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn terms of where miners source their power, Leverton noted that the Bitcoin Mining Council produces quarterly reports by surveying industry participants. The latest report found that around 60% of the power tapped by BMC's members\u2014which comprise nearly of the Bitcoin mining industry globally\u2014came from a sustainable power mix, harnessing sources like solar, wind, and hydro electricity.\n\n\"That data is incredibly relevant,\" Leverton said. \"It differs from other industries that aren't transparent about their energy use.\"\n\nThe conversation surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption reignited last month partly due to the \u201cSkull of Satoshi,\u201d an art installation unveiled as part of Greenpeace\u2019s \u201cChange the Code, Not the Climate\u201d campaign. Working with the artist Benjamin Von Wong, the international environmental NGO sought to bring attention to Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint. (Von Wong later said that his black-and-white perception of Bitcoin mining was wrong.)\n\nBut making a judgment about Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is influenced by whether or not someone thinks Bitcoin itself has any value, Leverton said. And she argued that the value versus energy critique hasn\u2019t historically been applied to other forms of technology with the same scrutiny, overlooking the potential that Bitcoin has to offer financial services to the globe's unbanked population at the same time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about how much energy the gaming industry uses, as an example, or whether video games have value to the broader population,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just accept that we know we assume that\u2019s a lot of energy, but we don\u2019t have a value debate about it.\u201d\n\nListen to the full episode and subscribe to the gm podcast."

        "title": "How Bitcoin can support the local beef industry - St Pete Catalyst",
        "content": "An organization promoting the Bitcoin economy and another focused on supporting the local beef industry have formed a seemingly unlikely partnership to improve community health and financial security.\n\nOrganizers with regionally based Bitcoin Bay and the Florida Beef Initiative have united to showcase solutions that foster localized food supply chains. Together, they hope to build a decentralized network of like-minded consumers and businesses.\n\nJune, who only goes by his first name, founded the Florida Beef Initiative. He explained how the recently formed collaboration was a natural fit as his organization emphasizes sound money and health.\n\n\u201cBitcoin, in our perspective, being the soundest money,\u201d June said. \u201cAnd beef being the soundest pathway to good health.\u201d\n\nThe Beef Initiative started in Texas as a trade group determined to increase food source localization, redundancy and security. A Florida chapter followed, a natural fit due to the state\u2019s extensive cattle industry history.\n\nAn industry in peril\n\nHowever, Floridians are losing their homegrown beef. A 2019 Fox News report noted that the state loses about 175,000 acres of farmland annually.\n\nThat same year \u2013 before the pandemic era land boom \u2013 Florida Raised said state ranchers \u201care in a life-or-death battle\u201d to preserve the over 500-year-old beef industry. The organization attributed increased competition from Mexican and South American producers and rapidly narrowing profit margins for the \u201chistoric decline\u201d in local cattle stocks.\n\nJune said the Beef Initiative promotes regenerative agriculture. That means cattle raised, slaughtered and processed in Florida.\n\nLeonard Horak, owner of Manatee County\u2019s Circle 6 ranch, is the Initiative\u2019s first local partner. He also joined June at a recent Bitcoin Bay Business Workshop.\n\nJune credited local Bitcoin enthusiasts for helping launch the Initiative due to their focus on educating the business community and consumers on the importance of diversifying their monetary holdings.\n\n\u201cLook at where this money has led us,\u201d he added. \u201cIt led us to this rancher, who \u2013 we\u2019ve been looking for this guy forever. It was a pretty beautiful marriage.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, and stakeholders want to decentralize the beef industry. The \u201cBig Four\u201d meat conglomerates \u2013 JBS Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Marfrig \u2013 control about 85% of the feedlot cattle.\n\nIn June 2022, Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger wrote that the companies raked in record profits while consumer prices soared. June said the Big Four buy South American beef grown with steroids and other substances illegal in the U.S., which leads to poor health outcomes and hurts local economies.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s stamped with USDA Prime, and nobody knows the difference because it came through one of their processing centers,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, what decentralizing the food supply means is basically for beef \u2026 making sure that every county has a microprocessor. They can process their beef. They can verify that their food is real.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, June said centralized financial institutions have a stranglehold on the nation\u2019s banking system. Like many people, he believes bitcoin can serve as a hedge against artificial inflation.\n\nHow Bitcoin can help\n\nWesley Schlemmer, executive director of Bitcoin Bay, said his organization started with informal weekly events educating people on the apex cryptocurrency\u2019s basics. It has since progressed into an official entity with a significant business network.\n\nHe noted that Tampa-based Blockspaces recently integrated Quickbooks software into the Lightning Network, which allows people to complete transactions with bitcoin nearly instantaneously for a fraction of credit card and wire transfer processing fees.\n\n\u201cAs the tools have got much better, usability increased,\u201d Schlemmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for nerds by nerds. More people have gotten involved and started making things actually practical.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said it was always a goal to use Bitcoin to support the local beef industry and mitigate Covid-induced supply chain disruptions.\n\nSchlemmer noted decentralization provides resiliency in times of crisis. If a health or economic issue forces a meat conglomerate to close \u2013 even temporarily \u2013 it would propel the nation into a food shortage and cause prices to soar.\n\nHe said oil and banking conglomerates, those \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d could have the same widespread effects. Schlemmer does not expect businesses to conduct all transactions with Bitcoin, but believes an alternate payment structure empowers owners and consumers.\n\n\u201cWe at Bitcoin Bay are really trying to create a trusted network, and this business workshop is one aspect of that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a directory; there\u2019s a mechanic near you that takes bitcoin, there\u2019s a landscaping guy and there\u2019s a beef guy. We\u2019re not under the impression that we\u2019re going to get the entire bay and everyone on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nSchlemmer relayed that his organization did not market the Florida Beef Initiative launch outside its network. Circle 6 sold $3,000 worth of beef in bitcoin at the event two weeks ago.\n\nHe added that demand for decentralized payments and businesses continues to grow alongside the state\u2019s population, and many who move to the area are \u201cfreedom oriented.\u201d Schlemmer expressed his desire for the region to become a vacation destination for Bitcoin enthusiasts.\n\nIn addition to the weather, beaches and myriad local attractions, June said visitors could also meet local ranchers. While Bitcoin Bay is creating a business network highlighting all industries, Schlemmer noted the importance of food producers.\n\n\u201cIf we have sound money, we have sound food,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s half, at least, of most people\u2019s lives \u2013 can I afford to pay my bills, and can I get food on my table that\u2019s not going to poison me.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Beef Initiative accepts bitcoin as payment for its locally sourced products through Bitcoin Bay and Via the Oshi app. Customers can pick up their beef boxes at the April 23 Bitcoin Bay Business Workshop, and delivery will launch soon.\n\nFor more information, visit the website here."

        "title": "Why has Russia grown to become a Bitcoin mining supergiant? - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Resource-abundant, but heavily sanctioned Russia took significant steps last year by turning to Bitcoin to evade sanctions. To add to the country\u2019s love affair with Bitcoin, recent reports suggested that Russia has climbed up the mining ladder as well. Let us explore the factors contributing to Russia\u2019s ascent as a Bitcoin mining supergiant.\n\nRamping up Crypto Mining Capacity\n\nRecently, Russia became the second-largest Bitcoin miner in the world after the electricity required to mine Bitcoin grew to 1 giga tonne in January-March 2023. Currently, Russia\u2019s mining power output ranks second in the world, trailing only the United States, which generates 3-4 giga tonne.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s largest mining operator, BitRiver, indicated that the country was able to increase the power generating capacity following a ban on mining activities in nearby Kazakhstan last year, combined with a shortage of electricity in China.\n\nUS, the leading Bitcoin miner in the world, faces heavy tax\n\nAdditionally, a slowdown in US mining activities amid rising electricity costs prices and a decrease in tax incentives may have allowed Russia to grab a bigger share of the Bitcoin mining pie.\n\nAlso Read: What is address poisoning and what can crypto investors do to avoid such attacks\n\nA 30 percent excise tax on the cost of powering crypto mining operations has been incorporated in US President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed budget for 2023. The proposal requires mining businesses to publish reports detailing how much electricity they consumed as well as the energy sources they used.\n\nSeveral states have also taken measures to limit mining following its negative impact on the environment. For example, New York became the first state to limit crypto mining along with imposing a two-year moratorium on new mining activities that use electricity derived from fossil fuel plants.\n\nAdditionally, Buncombe County in North Carolina is set to introduce a mandate which would prohibit mining activities for a year while Texas, which is said to be the Bitcoin mining capital of the US, is introducing a bill to regulate a miner\u2019s interaction with the electric power grid.\n\nRussian Government supporting crypto mining\n\nIn contrast to the US, Russia enjoys one of the lowest electricity prices in the world. According to Alisa Tsukanova, the marketing director of Russian crypto exchange EMCD, the mining capacity of Russia is expected to grow even more moving forward as several areas are becoming profitable in mining activities due to low energy prices. Furthermore, a \u201cfavorable climate for mining\u201d allows for lesser expenses on cooling equipment.\n\nThe crypto mining industry is also supported by the Russian government. Unlike the United States and Canada, which have moratoriums on various areas of crypto mining, Russia is granting tax breaks to crypto miners.\n\nReports also state that Russia will also subsidize a new 100 MW mining center in eastern Siberia for $12 million, which is anticipated to open in the first half of 2023 and will be operated by BitRiver.\n\nThis mining operation will employ 100 people and have 30,000 mining machines. With support from the government, BitRiver is expected to benefit from a wide range of incentives, including exemption from land or property taxes, reduced income tax rates, and subsidized electricity.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the support of the government and the increased efforts of crypto mining companies, there are still many obstacles ahead that could impede the growth of the sector. The State Duma submitted a bill to regulate mining in November 2022, which has not yet been passed, leaving the sector in a state of uncertainty.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Russia is here to stay as a relevant power in the Bitcoin mining field, or if it is simply looking for a new money source to temporarily help its ailing economy."

        "content": "Exness Promotes Samantha Hooi to Head of Events\n\nExness, a top forex and CFDs trading provider, has promoted Samantha Hooi, one of its event managers, to Head of Events. Hooi announced her promotion on LinkedIn on Tuesday.\n\nThe elevation comes nearly six years after Hoo joined the brokerage firm in July 2017 at its office in Lumpur, Malaysia. Speaking on the promotion, Hoo expressed excitement at \u201cthe opportunity to bring even more energy and success to our partners and clients.\u201d\n\nEx FINRA-Registered Broker Arrested for crypto Investment Fraud\n\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) disclosed on Tuesday that 27-year-old Rashawn Russell, a former investment banker and broker registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) was arrested on Monday in New York for allegedly operating a cryptocurrency investment fraud scheme.\n\nCiting a court document, the DOJ alleges that the ex-FINRA registered broker misappropriated much of the funds he solicited from investors, using them to gamble and pay select investors.\n\nKeep Reading Prop Trading Firm The Funded Trader Takes the Plunge into cTrader\n\n\u201cRussell is charged with one count of wire fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison,\u201d the DOJ added.\n\nNew Bybit's Headquarters in Dubai\n\nAs part of the new wave of crypto firms entering Dubai, Bybit, the third most popular digital assets exchange in the world, is set to open its global headquarters in the emirate in mid-April.\n\nBybit is among the first crypto exchange service providers to receive in-principle approval to operate in Dubai. The exchange is using this opportunity to strengthen its community-oriented platform by encouraging its partners and affiliates to exchange ideas and leverage the resources available at the new hub.\n\n\"With the opening of our global headquarters in Dubai, we are building a cadence to bolster our presence in the region and become a trusted partner for global traders and investors,\" Ben Zhou, the Co-Founder and CEO of Bybit, said.\n\nBen Zhou, the Co-Founder and CEO of Bybit\n\nSterling Trading Tech Launches Calculation Service\n\nSterling Trading Tech (STT) has unveiled a new calculation service for FINRA member firms that cater to the regulator's updated portfolio margining requirements. The new service has been launched in response to the recent changes to the requirements, which FINRA postponed from 1 April 2021, to later in 2023.\n\nSTT has developed the service after receiving feedback from clients and the industry, which called for a tool to generate the data elements required for this additional reporting. The service will cater to firms approved by FINRA for portfolio margin, including the concentration position requirements and global margin supplement details.\n\nBitcoin Breaks $30,000\n\nBitcoin crossed the $30,000 mark on Tuesday for the first time since 10 June 2022. The rally of cryptocurrency was fueled by the banking crisis in the United States that resulted in the shuttering of three banks in a mere four days. In Europe too, UBS hastily acquired rival Credit Suisse, a deal backed by the Swiss regulator to avoid a banking crisis.\n\nAccording to Coinmarketcap, Bitcoin jumped more than 6.2 percent in the past 24 hours and is now holding a market cap of over $582.1 billion. The cryptocurrency is up 80 percent year-to-date, as it started the year with a value of about $16,600.\n\nOther top cryptocurrencies also gained in the latest rally. Ether, the second-largest crypto in terms of market cap, is up by 3 percent, while Binance Coin gained over 5 percent. Solana, with a gain of about 11 percent, became one of the few cryptocurrencies with double-digit gains in the past 24 hours.\n\nCentral Bank of Montenegro Partners with Ripple\n\nThe Central Bank of Montenegro (CBCG) has signed an agreement to collaborate with blockchain technology firm, Ripple. Together, the two will develop a strategy and a pilot program for the launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in Montenegro.\n\nThe project of the CBDC launch will consist of multiple stages, including the identification of the practical application of a digital currency and the design to simulate its circulation and use under controlled conditions.\n\n\"Through the project, the CBCG will work with the Government of Montenegro and Montenegro\u2019s academia to create a practical digital currency or secure currency solution to test the main blockchain technology\u2019s functionality and potential. It will also analyse the advantages and risks that CBDCs or national stablecoins could pose concerning electronic means of payment availability, security, efficiency, compliance with regulations, and most importantly, the protection of end users\u2019 rights and privacy,\" said the Governor of CBCG, Radoje \u017dugi\u0107.\n\nBank of England Building Britcoin Team\n\nThe Bank of England is recruiting to build a team of 30 people for the development of a CBDC, which Britain's Prime Minister (then the Chancellor), Rishi Sunak, informally termed as Britcoin.\n\n\"A team of 30 seems like quite a significant resource to focus on the digital pound,\" Ian Taylor, an adviser to the trade association CryptoUK, told the Times. \"It shows the impact it would have, and that the bank [is] serious about it.\"\n\nHowever, the Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey is skeptical of a CBDC, as he questioned the need for a digital pound in front of the parliament\u2019s Treasury Select Committee.\n\nCypator Launches Crypto Trading\n\nCypator, a crypto trading Electronic Communication Network (ECN), launched spot crypto trading services on Tuesday for institutional participants. In addition, its services are available with the prime broker, Hidden Road, which acts as a counterparty to all trades and facilitates both the credit risk and settlement of the transactions.\n\nCurrently, Cypator ECN supports only crypto spot trading on a non-disclosed basis, but the company has plans to expand the offerings further.\n\n\"As an experienced team we looked at the crypto market and identified a gap in the trading liquidity infrastructure,\" said Ayal Jedeikin, the Founder and CEO of Cypator. \"We can now provide our clients with a counterparty who is willing to take on the risk and for a complementary trading solution which leverages that to enable all players to trade with each other in a seamless manner. With Hidden Road, we found a best of breed prime broker who is focused on being a \u2018true\u2019 prime broker while we will focus on providing the best institutional grade trading solution.\"\n\nFTX Bankruptcy Administrators Get $32.5M\n\nThe legal expanse of the bankruptcy process of the collapsed crypto exchange, FTX totaled around $32.5 million in February, which was received by lawyers and advisors. The figure surfaced with the court filings for monthly fee statements.\n\nThat figure did not include the $305,000 received in February by the Restructuring Chief and CEO, John J. Ray III. On top of that, his remuneration for March came in at $329,173, as he billed $1,300 per hour and reported working 255.9 hours in March.\n\nMeanwhile, FTX still did not return the funds of its creditors. Only the Japanese entity of FTX began the compensation process. Furthermore, the Cyprus-regulated European entity of FTX launched a website to process customer withdrawals."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, hit $30,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June 2022. In 2023 alone, Bitcoin has gained 80 per cent, data from coinmarketcap showed.\n\nFor the past three weeks, the crypto token was stuck in the range of $26,500 and $29,400.\n\n\"As expected, Bitcoin has entered an early bull phase by breaching the $30,000 mark for the first time since June 2022. The crypto market cap is at a whopping $1.23 trillion mark with BTC and ETH leading the effort. The combined effect of the Shanghai Ethereum upgrade, Bitcoin halving, and other macroeconomic factors are currently driving the momentum in the crypto market,\" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of crypto exchange BuyUcoin.\n\n\"The surge may be attributed to investors' positive outlook on the upcoming US inflation data, anticipating it might have an impact on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy,\" said Edul Patel CEO and co-founder of crypto platform Mudrex.\n\nEthereum, the second biggest crypto token, was trading at $1,921 on Tuesday.\n\nThe crypto industry is undergoing intense scrutiny in the US. Coinbase received a notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declaring its intention to bring an enforcement action. Earlier, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance founder Changpeng Zhao for alleged violations of derivatives regulations.\n\nHowever, the market has been seeing a rally since the collapse of three US banks as it revived the narrative that digital tokens offer a more attractive alternative to fiat currency and traditional finance.\n\nMoreover, the central banks are also seen reaching the peak of their rate hike cycle. The collapse of banks has also increased the chances of a pause in a rate hike by the Fed. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), last week, kept the benchmark interest rate, repo rate, unchanged at 6.5 per cent.\n\nInvestors are also eagerly anticipating a major revamp to the Ethereum blockchain this week, which will allow them to gain access to more than $33 billion of ether currency.\n\nThe software update, Shapella, will let market players redeem their \"staked ether\" - coins they have deposited and locked up on the network over the past three years in return for interest.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin surges to a 10-month high, Thakral said that it might be followed by a pullback.\n\n\"Bitcoin's new resistance level is now at $30,500, while its support level has been established at $29,200,\" said Patel.\n\n\"As we approach Bitcoin halving which is due in May 2024, we can expect the BTC price to rise further,\" said Om Malviya, president of blockchain adoption firm Tezos India."

        "content": "One in every two Bitcoin (BTC) in circulation has not been moved in the last two years.\n\n53% Of BTC Not Moved In Over 2 Years\n\nThis is according to Glassnode data shared by Antony Pompliano, a crypto and Bitcoin supporter, in a tweet on April 10.\n\nIf you take it a step further, almost 29% of all bitcoin in circulation have not moved in the last 5 years. That is over $150 billion in market cap that hasn't moved in half a decade. pic.twitter.com/33bivFYudV \u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) April 10, 2023\n\nWith over 53% of all BTC in circulating supply having not been moved in the last two years, holders appear unfazed by price action and volatility. What\u2019s important to note is that the number of coins that have remained dormant over the last two years has been rising. Glassnode data shows that it is at the highest level at current levels.\n\n\n\nA level deeper, Pompliano noticed that over 29% of all BTC in circulation, translating to a market capitalization of over $159 billion, has not been moved over the last five years. Meanwhile, about 15% of BTC has not been moved over the last decade. The coins that have not been moved over during this time, Pompliano notes, roughly equates to 15% or the over 2.5 million BTC assumed to be permanently lost or irretrievable.\n\nUnlike fiat transactions, the immutable nature of Bitcoin means once transactions have been confirmed on-chain, they cannot be reversed. Over the years, millions of coins have been lost, and many assume they cannot be recovered. This includes the big batch of coins mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin. Before disappearing in 2011, Nakamoto mined approximately 1 million BTC.\n\nBitcoin Total Supply Is Limited\n\nThe United States government is also one of the largest holders of Bitcoin, and they control the keys to these coins. On-chain trackers show that they hold 205,000 BTC, though they have been selling them regularly. Other large Bitcoin holders include MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm with shares listed on the NASDAQ, and Tesla, the electric car maker.\n\nBitcoin is a transactional layer, allowing users to send funds across borders conveniently using BTC, the network\u2019s native currency. The coin\u2019s total supply is limited to 21 million. Because the network is the first blockchain network with widespread support, the coin is also the most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nAs of April 11, each BTC in circulation was trading at over $30,000, translating to a market capitalization of $581,675,399,193. This pushes Bitcoin\u2019s dominance by the total crypto market share to 47%, according to data from CoinMarketCap (CMC), a coin tracker.\n\nFeature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Only for them to switch up and ban banking access to the crypto market. A classic case of actions speaking louder than words.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin has so far demonstrated resilience against FUD attacks. As evident by its ability to survive and thrive for more than a decade while gaining more popularity.\n\nThis is largely because of Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature. But what if governments attempted to attack or take advantage of the Bicoin mining system, the underlying mechanism behind Bitcoin decentralization?\n\nLawmakers in Arkansas, U.S seem to be siding with Bitcoin and are interested laws that will protect Bitcoin from government overreach. The US Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 aims to implement measures that will protect Bitcoin miners from unfair taxes and regulations.\n\nThe US Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 seeks to establish guidelines for Bitcoin miners and protect them from discriminatory regulations and taxes, guaranteeing that firms have the same rights as data centers. \u201cDiscrimination against digital asset mining business [is]\u2026 \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 10, 2023\n\nBased on Arkansas\u2019 official publication regarding the new act, Bitcoin mining facilities will be treated as data centers. So, why is this new Arkansas Act important for the crypto industry?\n\nWell, this is because governments might deploy unfair tactics such as heavy taxation to cripple the industry. Unfavorable regulations might discourage crypto mining activities.\n\nIs Bitcoin at risk of unfair taxation and regulation?\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, if a government was to act aggressively against Bitcoin in an effort to prevent mining, it might discourage mining. The potential outcome would be a slight dip in the hash rate, or a migration of miners to other favorable jurisdictions.\n\nIf anything, one could argue that unfair tax and regulatory measures against BTC mining would take away opportunities for the affected jurisdiction. The impact of such measures would likely also have a notable impact on Bitcoin miner reserves. The latter, at press time, stood at its YTD lows.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin miner reserves remained low reflecting a lack of confidence in the bulls dominating. The Bitcoin miner position index also depicted a low value, confirming that miners were still contributing to sell pressure.\n\nA look at miner flows revealed a surge in miner outflows in the last 24 hours as miner inflows dropped.\n\nThe above outcome is likely because the market has slowed down, leading to a drop in transactions, hence a drop in miner revenue. As such, miners have to sell some of their BTC holdings to cover their mining costs."
