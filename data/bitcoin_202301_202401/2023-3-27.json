        "content": "When El Salvador President Nayib Bukele made the controversial decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in his country, many people were skeptical and concerned about the potential risks.\n\nBukele announced on Twitter that the country would purchase one Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) each day starting Nov. 18, 2022. How is that going in 2023? The latest news out of El Salvador suggests that the government's bet on cryptocurrency is paying off.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: This Startup Built the World's First AI Marketing Platform That Can Understand Emotion and Some of the Biggest Companies on the Planet Are Already Using It\n\nAccording to Treasury Minister Alejandro Zelaya, the government has successfully repaid one of two outstanding $800 million bonds. This move is likely to allay concerns about a potential default, which had grown amid the country's adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nZalaya announced the news via Twitter on Jan. 23, highlighting the government's commitment to meeting its debt obligations and proving the skeptics wrong. Bukele tweeted, \u201cWell, we just paid in full 800 million dollars plus interest. But of course, almost no one is covering the story.\u201d\n\nThe government still owes $367 million plus interest on an additional bond set to mature in January 2025, but the successful repayment of the 2023 bond is a positive sign for the country's financial stability.\n\nWhat initially started as a largely controversial might be paying off as Bitcoin and many aspects of the blockchain-based asset market have began to rebound. Gamestop Corp.\u2019s NFT marketplace has seen a considerable boom. Some of the top NFT projects on the platform have seen volume spikes as high as 21,446%.\n\nSimilarly, leading NFT marketplace startup Gameflip recently crossed $900,000 raised from retail investors in their active equity crowdfunding raise. This comes after their announcement of hitting $160 million in lifetime volume on the platform earlier this month and a host of other milestones.\n\nBitcoin as Legal Tender\n\nThe small Central American country made headlines in 2021. The legislation required all businesses within the country to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for goods and services, granting it the same status as traditional fiat currencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nChivo Wallet, the wallet created by the government of El Salvador, said 2.2 million Salvadorans were onboarded just one month after Bitcoin became the country\u2019s legal tender. To encourage adoption, every user who successfully downloaded the app immediately received $30 in Bitcoin. By early 2022, about half of Salvadorans had downloaded the app.\n\nSee Next: Qnetic Unveils Revolutionary Flywheel Energy Storage System to Accelerate Renewable Energy Adoption\n\nThe \u201cBitcoin bet\u201d has been met with mixed reactions from international organizations and governments, with many expressing their concerns about potential risks that may arise from the use of cryptocurrency. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently issued a statement on El Salvador's decision to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, cautioning against potential risks associated with such adoption.\n\nAlthough there have not been any significant risks thus far following El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin, they noted it\u2019s important for authorities to be vigilant when providing government exposure to digital assets. According to the statement, crypto markets are still largely speculative and unpredictable in nature and should be approached with caution for El Salvador\u2019s economy to be safeguarded against potential losses.\n\nThe IMF also highlighted the importance of transparency when dealing with cryptocurrency transactions and emphasized that it is crucial for regulators to ensure they remain compliant with anti-money laundering laws and regulations. It advised El Salvador to develop effective regulatory frameworks aimed at mitigating financial stability risks associated with cryptocurrency use.\n\nEl Salvador appears undeterred by the IMF's recommendations. In January, its congress approved a digital securities law, paving the way for the country to raise funds through the issuance of the world's first sovereign blockchain bond. The law allows for the use of blockchain technology in the issuance, trading and clearing of securities, enabling greater efficiency and transparency in the process. The additional step forward for the country could potentially attract investment from tech-savvy investors looking for new opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup news & investments, sign up for Benzinga\u2019s Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nEl Salvadorian Prosperity in a time of uncertainty\n\nWhile the U.S. market faces uncertainty around banking and a general decline in U.S. equities, El Salvador\u2019s bet looks to be paying off. While El Salvador began buying Bitcoin at a significant premium to the current price, they also announced a purchase of 80 Bitcoin at a price around the $19,000 mark in July of 2022. They have also committed to purchasing one Bitcoin per day, every day since November of 2022. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was below $16,000. Roughly 126 days have passed since then meaning the company is still pouring millions into the digital currency despite the controversy, much of which has been at a steep discount to its current price of over $28,000.\n\nSee more on startups investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

        "title": "Financial Institutions Need to Support a Code Change to Cleanup Bitcoin - greenpeace.org",
        "content": "Financial Institutions Need to Support a Code Change to Cleanup Bitcoin\n\nBig financial services companies like Fidelity need to acknowledge Bitcoin\u2019s climate pollution and other environmental impacts by taking responsibility for the problem. The financial industry is generating revenue and creating services to help grow this energy-intensive cryptocurrency. At the same time, corporate pledges to reduce carbon emissions and sustainability plans don\u2019t include Bitcoin\u2019s climate impacts or risks.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u201cHumanity is on thin ice \u2014 and that ice is melting fast\u2026Our world needs climate action on all fronts \u2014 everything, everywhere, all at once.\u201d\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres March 2023 1\n\nThe impacts of our climate crisis are growing every day. The fossil fuel industry continues to threaten lives and livelihoods, from families in Florida struggling to rebuild after Hurricane Ian to farmers in Central America displaced by drought to children living near coal-fired power plants suffering from asthma.2 Our society needs rapid decarbonization to avert accelerating climate change damage. According to the International Energy Association, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is necessary for limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 C, which requires no more investments in fossil fuel supplies and rapid growth of renewable energy.3\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Bitcoin has become a substantial and growing barrier to slashing carbon emissions and phasing out fossil fuels. Bitcoin\u2019s consensus mechanism or validating transactions on its digital ledger or blockchain consumes massive amounts of electricity from fossil fuels. Globally, its largest single source of electricity is coal-fired power plants.4 The digital \u201cmining\u201d involved in maintaining Bitcoin is now emitting more greenhouse gas emissions than many small and mid-sized countries.5\n\nThe financial industry is critical to all aspects of Bitcoin \u2013 from financing large digital \u201cmining\u201d companies, facilitating conversions to and from fiat currencies, and making the technology more accessible and widely adopted.6 Financial companies in various sectors are boosting their crypto and Bitcoin business, despite pledges to reduce climate emissions and increase corporate sustainability. Banks, asset managers, and payment processing companies need to take responsibility for the climate and community impacts of Bitcoin and support a code change to solve these growing problems at a global scale.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Dirty Energy Problem\n\nThe source of Bitcoin\u2019s climate problem comes from its code. Here is how it works. Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency that operates outside of a central bank or government by using a decentralized and collectively-maintained database, or digital ledger, a record of all Bitcoin transactions stored on the blockchain. The records\u2019 accuracy is protected through cryptography to prevent double counting and fraudulent transactions. This process requires a mechanism for validating transactions. Bitcoin does this through \u201cProof of Work\u201d \u2013 meaning users must show they are committed to protecting the system\u2019s integrity by putting in work, and thereby consuming electricity.7\n\nThe \u201cwork\u201d is like a massive guessing game in which specialized computers, called ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), race against one another to guess the right answer to an algorithm. The computers act like random number generators, and those with more computing power can guess more numbers in less time, increasing their chances of picking the correct number. The winner gets to validate a new set, or \u201cblock,\u201d of Bitcoin transactions added to the blockchain, and is rewarded with newly \u201cmined\u201d Bitcoin and fees.8\n\nSpeed demands large amounts of energy to power warehouses full of computers. Bitcoin mining is estimated to use more electricity than some entire countries, including what the Philippines and the Netherlands consumed in 2020.9 In the U.S., the seven largest crypto mining companies use the same amount of electricity needed to power every residence in Houston, with a population of 2.3 million people.10\n\nBitcoin mining is estimated to use more electricity than Netherlands\n\nThe amount of electricity will only increase; as more miners join the competition and computers become faster, Bitcoin\u2019s system automatically adjusts making it more difficult to guess the right number, thus requiring even more computing power and electricity.11 In 2014 the electricity to mine a single Bitcoin was equal to what an average U.S. household used in 275 days but by 2022 that skyrocketed to around nine years.12\n\nThe cheaper the energy source, the more profit for the miners. Thus, miners have an incentive to seek cheap energy, which often means polluting fossil fuels like coal power. Researchers at Cambridge University estimate that 62% of the electricity used for Bitcoin mining globally in 2022 came from fossil fuels, with the most from coal and only 26% from renewables.13 Bitcoin mining companies have even reopened mothballed coal-fired power plants in the U.S.14 The world needs to speed up the transition away from coal, not bring more coal power online.15 The dirty energy powering the Bitcoin mining industry in 2021 produced around 65.4 MtCO2 annually, comparable to country-level emissions from Greece.16 And Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint has only grown over time. Researchers estimate that in 2021, a single mined Bitcoin was responsible for emitting 126 times the CO2 as a Bitcoin mined in 2016.17\n\nThe environmental damages from Bitcoin go beyond the GHG emissions. Communities living near Bitcoin mining facilities face an array of negative impacts from air, water, and noise pollution. Stronghold Digital Mining, a company in which Fidelity Investments holds stocks, has purchased several waste-coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania.18 Waste coal is one of the dirtiest forms of energy. Nearby residents are exposed to hazardous air pollution including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, and safety risks from large trucks carrying waste coal on small country roads to the plant.19 Communities across the U.S. living near Bitcoin mines have also complained about the constant noise from the 24-hour operations.20 One person living near a mining facility in Limestone, Tennessee, described the noise as \u201clike a jet engine idling on a nearby tarmac.\u201d21 Water pollution can come from water withdrawal and discharge for power plant operations and cooling mining facilities, solid waste from burning fossil fuels, and land use changes from the construction of these industrial operations.22\n\nThe thousands of specialized Bitcoin mining computers only last a short time, and quickly become obsolete and turn into e-waste. Data is incomplete, but one estimate suggests Bitcoin mining generates roughly 45.51 kt of e-waste in a year, equivalent to the IT waste generated by the Netherlands.23\n\nTies Between Big Finance and Polluting Bitcoin\n\nWhile Bitcoin began as an alternative to traditional banking, it has become increasingly interconnected with the mainstream financial sector, which is helping grow Bitcoin and, in turn, its environmental damages. Some of the world\u2019s largest banks, asset managers, and payment processing companies are creating new crypto-related services and platforms, and funding Bitcoin mining companies \u2013 all of which impact the climate crisis.\n\nMany different financial sectors are getting into cryptocurrency and providing services, capital, and expertise vital to Bitcoin\u2019s expansion. Asset managers like Fidelity Investments control funds that own stock in Bitcoin mining companies and offer investment products that let institutional and retail customers bet on the price of Bitcoin.24 Banks, such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase, are creating new opportunities for clients to invest in Bitcoin and the crypto sector, doing research and consulting on cryptocurrency, and directly investing in Bitcoin miners.25 Banks also provide vital services for cryptocurrency companies, like exchanges, to conduct daily operations, and move Bitcoin back and forth between U.S. Dollars.26 Meanwhile payment processing companies are making it easier to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions and partnering with crypto exchange companies to offer debit and credit cards that use Bitcoin.27\n\nWhile these large financial services companies have made pledges to reduce their carbon emissions, they continue to invest in carbon-intensive Bitcoin. Many banks, asset managers, and payment processing companies have supported the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and made net-zero emissions pledges, joining global initiatives like the United Nations Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the United Nations Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero.28 Yet these companies continue to invest in Bitcoin and have largely failed to report their Bitcoin-related emissions.\n\nCompanies know there is a problem. In 2017, Mastercard stated in its Corporate Sustainability Report that \u201cnew research shows that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are inherently more energy-intensive than Mastercard\u2019s payment network.\u201d29 Yet Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature seems to have distributed responsibility for its impacts. Without traditional leadership, Bitcoin\u2019s future depends on its users and stakeholders to guide its future. To date leaders in the financial industry have yet to acknowledge responsibility for the problem or taken meaningful steps to push for a code change that would clean up Bitcoin\u2019s climate impacts. As the climate crisis worsens and Bitcoin\u2019s appetite for electricity continues to grow, so will the pressure on financial firms tied to Bitcoin to address its impacts.\n\nFidelity Investments\n\nOur research finds that Fidelity Investments, the fourth largest asset manager in the world, is making a big splash into Bitcoin and leading the way for the financial industry.30 Fidelity was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies with a foray into Bitcoin mining in 2014 under the leadership of the new CEO Abigail Johnson, who is positioning the company to be a leader in cryptocurrency.31 Fidelity now offers many ways for institutional, private, and retail customers to invest in Bitcoin, and is using its brand and reputation to instill a sense of trust in volatile and polluting Bitcoin.\n\nThe company started a unit, Fidelity Digital Assets, in 2018 to focus on crypto investments and services.32 The unit began by offering crypto trading and custody \u2013 taking responsibility for securely storing investors\u2019 digital assets \u2013 for institutions. In March 2023, the company launched its own Bitcoin trading and custody program for retail customers called \u201cFidelity Crypto.\u201d33 This move marks the first time a major financial institution got involved in directly trading cryptocurrencies and could compete with exchanges run by crypto-focused companies like Coinbase.34\n\nIn a major move that could bring Bitcoin investing to millions of Americans, the company announced in 2022 that employers with Fidelity 401(k) retirement plans now have an option to let their employees direct a portion of savings into Bitcoin.35 This decision sparked widespread concern from regulators and policy-makers. The Department of Labor issued guidance suggesting 401(k) plans avoid speculative and volatile crypto investments.36\n\nThrough Fidelity\u2019s numerous investment funds, the company enables investing in Bitcoin and holds stock in many Bitcoin-related companies. Fidelity is the first major asset manager to create an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to the current price of Bitcoin, the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF (FBTC). FBTC is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which lets clients indirectly invest in Bitcoin.37 The Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (FDIG) invests in crypto-related companies.38 Fidelity holds stock in publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies, such as Marathon Digital Holdings, through these crypto-specific and other general market funds.39\n\nAt the same time, Fidelity has sustainability goals and reports on environmental and climate issues. Fidelity is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment and supports recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Fidelity\u2019s 2021 Environmental Report states that the company\u2019s goal is, \u201cto reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by expanding use of renewable energy, with a dedicated focus on reducing carbon.\u201d40 The company\u2019s Environmental Sustainability Statement of Intent claims it is beginning to adopt sustainability throughout the business, including fund operations, products, risk management, and procurement.41\n\nRecommendations\n\nBig financial services companies like Fidelity need to acknowledge Bitcoin\u2019s climate pollution and other environmental impacts by taking responsibility for the problem. The financial industry is generating revenue and creating services to help grow this energy-intensive cryptocurrency. At the same time, corporate pledges to reduce carbon emissions and sustainability plans don\u2019t include Bitcoin\u2019s climate impacts or risks.\n\nTo help solve Bitcoin\u2019s climate problem, these companies can use financial clout and influence to incentivize a Bitcoin code change that virtually eliminates its climate impacts and aligns Bitcoin with many other and newer cryptocurrencies that use dramatically less electricity.42 Financial companies can lead the way by convening experts, funders, and policymakers to create a clean-future for Bitcoin. Now is the time to catalyze creativity and ingenuity to design the next revolution in cryptocurrency.\n\nFinancial companies can use clout and influence to incentivize a Bitcoin code change that virtually eliminates its climate impacts\n\nOther cryptocurrencies have also changed, like Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. It slashed its energy use by 99.95% by transitioning from a Proof of Work consensus mechanism to a form of Proof of Stake.43\n\nBitcoin\u2019s code has changed in the past and can be changed again to protect our climate and communities.44 Its code is open and transparent; anyone with the requisite skills can propose code modifications. The main challenge is not technical, but social; large and small stakeholders within the Bitcoin community can champion improvements and must reach consensus on making changes.45\n\nBitcoin can thrive without energy-intensive, noisy, and polluting digital mining. Bitcoin\u2019s future growth may depend on it. The technology is still in its early years, having debuted in 2009. With the right resources, incentives, and support, new methods of securing its ledger and maintaining decentralization can be developed and adopted. To achieve this change, financial institutions connected to the system must work with other stakeholders to change it for the better.\n\nReferences"

On Tuesday the Senate Committee on Business and Commerce heard testimony on a bill that would also mandate virtual currency mining shut down during times of a power emergency.\n\noperates a large bitcoin mining operation in a 100-acre . It is such a power user that when electricity is in short supply ERCOT pays them to curtail their operations.\n\nwould ban that kind of arrangement. The bill\u2019s sponsor, State Senator Lois Kolkhorst from Brenham explained, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to produce all this new power. We\u2019re going to have a lot of this new power taken up by virtual currency mining. And then we\u2019re going to pay them to go off the grid at different times, which I believe is a part of their business model.\u201d\n\nSB 1751 would also require large customers to coordinate directly with ERCOT in a power emergency. But other electric providers want the bill go further.

        "content": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year.\n\nCryptocurrencies dropped on Monday morning after the CFTC sued Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world, for allegedly violating trading rules.\n\nThe price of bitcoin slid 3% to $26,955.61, according to Coin Metrics. Ether fell 3.5% to $1,704.56.\n\nIn a court filing, the CFTC, or the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission, said Binance violated eight provisions of a commodities trading law \"designed to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorism financing.\" The lawsuit, which was filed Monday in a federal court in Chicago, has the potential to upend the exchange's operations.\n\nDessislava Aubert, an analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko, said although bitcoin's March rally had already started to slow in the last week, the down move Monday was largely driven by the news about Binance. It's \"the largest crypto exchange and any U.S. regulatory action against it will have huge implications for the industry,\" she said.\n\nThe CFTC court filing follows a CNBC report on Binance employees who have worked to subvert the exchange's compliance controls in China. Similarly, CFTC alleges that Binance has instructed its workers and customers to circumvent these controls.\n\n\"Many knew Binance had a bullseye on its back, but this is still unnerving some crypto traders,\" said Ed Moya, an analyst at Oanda. \"Binance's success is needed to ensure a good part of the cryptoverse can grow.\"\n\nCrypto exposed equities suffered from the news too. Coinbase and Microstrategy each fell 10%. Miners Marathon Digital, Hut 8 and Riot Platforms lost about 8% each.\n\nThe losses came in tandem with a surge in bond yields, which pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down 0.6%. Rising rates make future profits, like those promised by growth-oriented companies, less attractive."

There are around 240 tradable assets on the exchange, which you can browse here. Coinbase is more for beginners, while Advanced Trade is for avid and experienced traders who make high volume transactions and want more trading options. (Coinbase announced it was sunsetting its premium service Coinbase Pro in June of 2022 and migrating its users to Advanced Trade.)\n\nInterest in investing on apps like Robinhood has boomed recently. Cryptocurrency is no exception, and Coinbase reaped many of the benefits. Coinbase is now available in more than 100 countries.\n\nThe platform is pretty straightforward. Like many trading apps, users can see their balance and a watchlist, which allows them to track the prices of different kinds of cryptocurrencies. Traders can also check which cryptocurrencies are the biggest movers. The company also offers Coinbase Card, a Visa debit card that users can use to earn rewards for spending the assets in their portfolio.\n\nIn September 2021, Coinbase announced a new direct deposit option that will allow users to have their paychecks directly deposited to Coinbase and their pay automatically deposited as bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.\n\nIs Coinbase free?\n\nCoinbase charges a fee for trading via the platform (unlike apps like Robinhood, which touts \u201cfree trading\u201d).\n\nThe fees differ for trading on Coinbase can be complicated, since it doesn\u2019t charge a flat fee. The company is also not very transparent about its fees \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to see exactly how much you\u2019re paying until just before you submit your order. Fees are calculated when you place orders and take into account factors like your location, payment method and order size, as well as market conditions, volatility and liquidity. Coinbase also includes a spread in the price, which is the difference between the asset\u2019s market price and the price you\u2019re buying or selling that asset for.\n\nThe fee structure for Advanced Trade uses a simpler maker-taker model. (Maker orders are those that provide liquidity, while taker orders remove liquidity.) The fees are between 0% and 0.60% per trade with lower costs for larger dollar transactions. For example, a transaction of less than $10,000 has a 0.40% maker fee and a 0.60% taker fee, while a transaction between $10,000 and $50,000 has a 0.25% maker fee and a 0.40% taker fee.\n\nCoinbase doesn\u2019t charge users to hold their assets in a digital wallet or to transfer cryptocurrency from one wallet to another within the Coinbase network. But Coinbase's fee can definitely chip away at your winnings, especially if you're not using Advanced Trade.\n\nHow to open a Coinbase account\n\nOpening a Coinbase account is pretty straightforward. You\u2019ll need a government-issued photo ID, as well as information like your phone number and the last four digits of your Social Security number. Be ready to answer questions about what you\u2019ll use the platform for. When choosing a password, use proper cyber hygiene \u2014 like a unique password you haven\u2019t seen elsewhere and multi-factor authentication \u2014 to avoid hackers getting ahold of your account.\n\nBefore you begin trading, you\u2019ll need to attach a payment method to your Coinbase account. In the U.S., you can use a bank account, debit card, wire transfer, PayPal account, Apple Pay or Google Pay. Actions like cashing out aren\u2019t available across all these payment methods, but you can see what you can do with each here.\n\nOnce you have your digital wallet set up, you\u2019re ready to trade. Coinbase doesn\u2019t offer trading for all cryptocurrencies, but the exchange does regularly add new coins.\n\nAds by Money. We may be compensated if you click this ad.

Begin Investing\n\nIs it a good time to invest in cryptocurrency?\n\nCrypto prices reached several record highs during the pandemic, but they\u2019ve since fallen significantly.\n\nIn November 2021, bitcoin\u2019s price hit a record high of around $68,000 per coin, more than double what the price had been in July of that year. Meanwhile, ether \u2014 the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value after bitcoin \u2014 also hit a new high in November 2021 at around $4,800. Altcoins, cryptocurrencies that aren\u2019t bitcoin, have grabbed attention too: Dogecoin surged 8,000% in the first few months of 2021, and Shiba Inu coin and a token called Omicron once skyrocketed.\n\nNowadays, it\u2019s a different story. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates since March 2022 \u2014 a move used to tamp down inflation but that also tends to weigh on the price of financial assets like stocks, bonds and crypto. The crypto industry has also experienced an extreme erosion of trust, in part due to the implosion of some previously trusted companies, like the major exchange FTX. The price of bitcoin has tumbled to below $20,000 per coin since its record high and, as of March 2023, is around $28,000 per coin.\n\nOf course, these wild ups and downs should give investors pause.\n\nAside from its price volatility, cryptocurrency is a risky investment. As a relatively new technology, crypto isn\u2019t regulated the way financial assets like stocks and bonds are. While there have been recent moves to more closely regulate crypto, experts say the future is still uncertain (especially since added regulation could change up the way crypto companies do business). In March, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned Coinbase that it had identified potential violations of U.S. law related to some of its crypto products in just the latest example of a crackdown on the industry. Overall, financial advisors tend to recommend not investing money in crypto that you aren\u2019t prepared to lose.\n\nHow to buy and sell cryptocurrency with Coinbase\n\nIt\u2019s time to pick your cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptos that are among the most popular and expensive cryptocurrencies \u2014 like bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash \u2014 are often considered safer than others, Hanna Halaburda, an associate professor at NYU Stern School of Business, previously told Money. That\u2019s because there is more computational power put into maintaining their blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies, making them more expensive for hackers to attack. They have also been around for years, so if there was a bug, we would likely know about it, she adds.\n\nFor most investors, buying a bitcoin that has had a price as high as around $68,000 per coin likely isn\u2019t an option. Ether has cost more than $4,000 per coin and even litecoin, which has cost more than $300 per coin in the past, may be more than you want to spend. But Coinbase allows users to buy a small fraction of a coin. It\u2019s common for investing apps like Robinhood to allow traders to buy fractional shares \u2014 like investing $25 in popular stocks like Amazon and Apple instead of the more than $100 you would need to buy a full share. With Coinbase, traders can buy or sell as little as $2 worth of digital currency.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there are no concerns in general. Cryptocurrencies have proven to be volatile \u2014 just look at the market\u2019s last few years.\n\nThe digital currencies also, again, aren\u2019t regulated in the same way as other assets. Before a company sells its stock to the public, it needs to go through strict scrutiny by the SEC. Before an investment advisor can recommend that stock, they need to be confident it\u2019s in the investor\u2019s best interest. There are a lot of protections for investors that you don\u2019t have with crypto, says James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University.\n\nPlus, cryptocurrencies don\u2019t actually have any intrinsic value, so the speculative asset is completely at the whim of the value the market attributes to it.\n\nIs it safe to buy and sell cryptocurrency with Coinbase?\n\nTo buy and sell cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll need a digital wallet where you'll hold your currency between transactions. Unlike a regular wallet, a digital wallet has an added concern: Is the crypto wallet safe from hackers?\n\nThere are a few options, each with their own security measures.\n\nIf you don't want to worry about keeping cryptocurrency separate from the Coinbase app, you can use what is called a hosted wallet. This wallet is held for you by a third party \u2014 in this case, Coinbase \u2014 which means you don't have to worry about forgetting your password and losing all your cryptocurrency. (That\u2019s a real concern: Some crypto investors have lost millions of dollars because they can\u2019t remember how to get into their wallets.)\n\nCryptocurrency isn\u2019t insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, like your bank account or investment portfolio. But Coinbase says it \"carries crime insurance that protects a portion of digital currencies held across our storage systems against losses from theft\" \u2014 like from a cybersecurity breach \u2014 but not from unauthorized access to your account. The company also says that it keeps 98% or more of its customers\u2019 digital currency offline. A dollar balance of up to $250,000 is FDIC-insured on Coinbase.\n\nIf you want full control of your cryptocurrency without a third party's involvement, you can opt for what's called a non-custodial wallet. While you don't have to worry about the third party being hacked, you do have to remember your password yourself, or risk losing your cryptocurrency. But having more control means you can participate in more advanced activities, like yield farming, which allows the cryptocurrency owner to lend out their assets to generate higher returns. Coinbase customers can choose to download the Coinbase Wallet, separate from the app, which is a non-custodial wallet.\n\nIf you want security from your computer being hacked, you can go for a cold wallet \u2014 also called a hardware wallet \u2014 which is a physical device like a USB that\u2019s not connected to the internet. They can be pricey; the Ledger Nano X is $149 and the Trezor Model T is $219 as of March 2023.\n\nWant to learn more?

        "title": "What You Must Know Before Investing in Cryptocurrency - Investopedia",
        "content": "When it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype. Digital currencies have quickly risen to prominence in the portfolios of many retail and institutional investors. At the same time, analysts have continued to caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf you\u2019ve decided to invest in the cryptocurrency market, it\u2019s important, as with any other investment, to do your research. Below, we\u2019ll explore what you should know before you invest.\n\nKey Takeaways When it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype.\n\nTake time to learn about the different currencies offered, in addition to researching blockchain technology such as consensus mechanisms.\n\nUnderstanding the differences between a hot and cold wallet; consider investing in both.\n\nThere are many primers on blockchain technology that are accessibly written for the layperson in addition to technical white papers.\n\nAs you begin moving money around networks, perform test transactions to ensure your transfers are successful.\n\n\n\nConsider Why You Are Investing in Cryptocurrency\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental question you should ask yourself before making a cryptocurrency investment is why you\u2019re doing it. There are myriad investment vehicles available, many of which offer greater stability and less risk than digital currencies.\n\nAre you interested simply because of cryptocurrency\u2019s trendiness? Or is there a more compelling reason for an investment in one or more specific digital tokens? Of course, different investors have various personal investment goals, and exploring the cryptocurrency space may make more sense for some individuals than for others.\n\nTo start, begin by taking a comprehensive approach of evaluating your personal risk appetite, investment goals, and portfolio diversification. You may be interested in cryptocurrency as an alternative asset to what you already hold. You may also be interested in potentially higher returns with the understanding that this reward comes with potentially higher risks. Before investing in cryptocurrency, gain a personal understanding of what you hope to achieve as this will help set the course for your actions.\n\nSecure Your Keys\n\nIn cryptocurrency, a private key is a secret alphanumeric code that allows a user to access and control their digital assets. In a way, it's basically just the password that grants ownership and control of the funds associated with a specific cryptocurrency address. Anyone who has access to the private keys of an address has access to all of the funds in that address. This is why it's essential to keep private keys secure and never share them with anyone.\n\nPrivate keys are typically generated by a cryptocurrency wallet, and your keys are automatically generated. It's important to note that if a user loses their private key, they'll lose access to their funds forever. Therefore, it's crucial to keep private keys safe and secure by storing them offline in a cold wallet or using a reputable custodial service.\n\nIn addition, keeping your cryptocurrency on exchanges in a simple way to keep your cryptocurrency liquid and easy to exchange. However, because exchanges technically have access to your keys in this case, you may be more susceptible to losing your funds should the exchange fail or be hacked. Consider solutions to safely storing your private keys such as writing them down using an old fashioned paper and pencil.\n\n\n\nYour keys are a series of words that are virtually impossible for hackers to guess. Never tell anyone your keys, and store them in a safe location.\n\nGet a Feel for the Industry\n\nIt\u2019s essential for investors\u2014particularly those who are new to digital currencies\u2014to develop a sense of how the digital currency world works before investing. Take time to learn about the different currencies offered. With thousands of different coins and tokens available, it\u2019s crucial to look beyond the biggest names like Bitcoin or Ether.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s important to explore blockchain technology to get a sense of how this aspect of the cryptocurrency world works. For example, every blockchain has a consensus protocol to ensure the integrity of the ledger. However, there are different types of consensus protocols. For example, proof-of-work protocols are those that require substantial mining set-ups to validate transactions. Meanwhile, proof-of-stake protocols reward holders with the highest stakes with validation rewards.\n\nUnderstanding different aspects of this may impact your investment. For instance, you may be able to stake your cryptocurrency to generate rewards and increase your holdings. On the other hand, proof-of-stake coins may be inflationary if the rewards given to validators is not closely monitored.\n\nYou can earn passive income from cryptocurrency via staking rewards.\n\nConsider Hot and Cold Wallets\n\nWhen you buy a cryptocurrency, you can store it in a cold wallet or a hot wallet. The main difference between a hot and cold wallet is their level of security and convenience. Hot wallets are convenient for frequent trading and spending of cryptocurrency but are more vulnerable to hacking and theft. Cold wallets are more secure but less convenient for frequent use.\n\n\n\nThe main difference is the connectivity to the wallet. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and can be accessed easily. Examples of hot wallets include online exchanges, mobile wallets, and software wallets. Though hot wallets are great for ease of transacting, hot wallets are also more vulnerable to hacking and theft. If a hacker gains access to your hot wallet, they can potentially steal all your cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nA cold wallet, on the other hand, is not connected to the internet. This type of wallet may be a hardware wallet or paper wallet. Though a cold wallet offers a higher level of security, they are more difficult to transact with. Though they are not vulnerable to online attacks or hacking attempts, it's harder to buy and sell securities from a cold wallet.\n\nAs you embark on your cryptocurrency journey, consider which wallet makes more sense to you. In many cases, investors have both and store more material values or more valuable cryptocurrency via their cold wallet. Then, any balances they may be willing to lose or wish to play with may be kept on the hot wallet.\n\n\n\nRead Cryptocurrency White Papers\n\nMore important than word of mouth, though, are the specifics of a digital currency itself. When you\u2019re considering an investment, take the time to find the project\u2019s white paper. Every cryptocurrency project should have one, and it should be easily accessible (if it\u2019s not, consider that a red flag).\n\nRead the white paper carefully; it should tell you everything about what the developers of the project intend for their work, including a time frame, a general overview, and specifics about the project. If the white paper does not contain data and specific details about the project, that is generally seen as a negative. The white paper is a development team\u2019s chance to lay out the who, what, when, and why of their project. If the white paper feels incomplete or misleading, then it might speak to fundamental issues with the project itself.\n\nIn addition, developers may issue updates to their white paper, especially as it surrounds their development road map. Be wary of projects whose timelines continually shift with minimal progress.\n\nPerform Test Transactions\n\nCryptocurrency is unlike banks in many aspects. One of the most vital reasons to understand this is should you accidently send money to the wrong place, it may be impossible (literally) to recover. In some cases, you may lose your money forever.\n\nAs you join the cryptocurrency world, understand the importance of test transactions. Test transactions are an essential step when sending cryptocurrency because they allow you to confirm that the transaction will be successful before sending a significant amount of funds. Though they result in higher fees, they very well may be worth preventing a large error.\n\nTest transactions involve sending a small amount of cryptocurrency to a test address. It is meant to simulate a real transaction without actually sending funds to another party. This allows you to test the sending and receiving process, confirm that your wallet is working correctly, and ensure that you have the correct address for the recipient. Once the test transaction has successfully been performed, you can copy the same transaction information for larger exchanges.\n\nA test transaction should be a small such as $1.00; once the transaction goes through, you'll know you can send larger amounts.\n\nPatience Is Key\n\nAfter diligent research, you have likely developed a feel for the cryptocurrency industry and may have determined one or more projects in which to invest. The next step is to time your investment. The digital currency world moves quickly and is known for being highly volatile.\n\nRemember that digital currencies are highly speculative. For every overnight bitcoin millionaire, many other investors have poured money into the virtual-token realm only to see that money disappear. Investing in this space means taking a risk. By doing your homework before making an investment, you help give yourself the best chance of success.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\n\nIs Investing In Cryptocurrency a Good Idea? While analysts caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies, some investors are willing to take the risk for the potential reward. It\u2019s critical to do your research beforehand to determine if investing in cryptocurrency is right for you.\n\nHow Do I Learn More About Crypto I Want To Buy? To learn more about cryptocurrencies, join an online community of cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts, such as that found on Reddit, to see what the community is discussing. Read the white paper that outlines specific details about the cryptocurrency project that you\u2019re considering. Every project should have an easily accessible white paper\u2014if it\u2019s not, consider that a red flag.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype. Analysts continue to caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies. If you\u2019ve decided to invest in the cryptocurrency market, it\u2019s important\u2014same as with any other investment\u2014to do your research. Consider why you\u2019re interested in this particular investment vehicle, and familiarize yourself with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, to be more fully equipped to determine whether this type of investment opportunity is worthwhile for you.\n\n\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

        "title": "Bitcoin price holds its ground in the wake of CFTC case against Binance - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell 3.6% to $26,900 after Binance and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao were sued by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission on March 27. To date, Binance has been investigated by the CFTC, Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and federal prosecutors.\n\nThe Bitcoin price correction may have been limited due to Silicon Valley bank\u2019s successful asset sale to First Citizens BancShares at a $16.5 billion discount, which received an extraordinary credit line from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to compensate for potential future losses.\n\nOil prices also increased by 5% on March 27 after Russian President Vladimir Putin escalated geopolitical tensions in Europe. As reported by Investing.com, Russia plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus, in a move designed to intimidate opposing countries over their support for Ukraine.\n\nFurther tension from the crypto industry arose after a U.S. Federal Judge decided to temporarily halt the proposed sale of Voyager Digital to Binance.US. on March 27. Judge Jennifer Rearden of the U.S. District Court in New York granted the request for an emergency stay.\n\nLet\u2019s examine Bitcoin derivatives metrics to determine the current market position of professional traders.\n\nBitcoin futures show no impact from the CFTC\u2013Binance case\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks, which typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement for a longer period.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts on healthy markets should trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe Binance news had no effect on the Bitcoin futures premium, despite the fact that the exchange holds 33% of the $11.2 billion open interest. The two-month contract premium is 3.5%, which is less than the neutral 5% threshold. Had there been some panic selling using leverage futures contracts, the indicator would have quickly moved to zero or even negative.\n\nThe absence of demand for leverage longs does not necessarily imply a price decline. As a result, traders should investigate Bitcoin\u2019s options markets to learn how whales and market makers value the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nBitcoin options traders remain slightly optimistic\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign showing when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. In bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe 25% skew ratio stands at -5, indicating that the protective put options are trading at a slight discount, confirming the Binance news\u2019 irrelevance. More importantly, the CFTC action had no effect on the 25% skew, so whales and market markets are not pricing in any meaningful market structure change.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price will hit this key level before $30K, survey says\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger\n\nThe fact that derivatives indicators were barely impacted could be the \u201cremote misses\u201d effect, as analysis and pundits evaluate the odds of Binance and CZ getting anything more than a million-dollar fine and some term of conduct adjustment.\n\nThis type of psychological distortion was first observed in London during World War II when survivors who did not face imminent losses became even more confident and less likely to feel traumatized.\n\nIt appears unlikely that the market will price in higher odds of extreme volatility until those whales and arbitrage desks face more than a 3.5% price correction.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) users will soon be able to use zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) to expedite the process of verifying individual blocks and, eventually, the entire blockchain.\n\nZeroSync Association, a Swiss-based nonprofit, is developing tooling which allows users to validate the state of the Bitcoin network without having to download the blockchain or trust a third party for verification.\n\nZeroSync was formed to develop and maintain open-source software that enables succinct ZK-proofs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The group uses StarkWare\u2019s proprietary Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (zk-STARK) validity proofs to generate ZK-proofs for the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe tool promises to overhaul the process of verifying the Bitcoin blockchain, which still requires node operators to download a large amount of data to synchronize the correct state of the Bitcoin network.\n\nZeroSync is using ZK-proofs to eventually generate valid proof and verify the latest state of the blockchain almost instantaneously.\n\nZK-proofs have been a revelation for the Ethereum ecosystem, with various proof methods powering several layer-2 scaling platforms, including Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism and StarkNet.\n\nRelated: Polygon\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019 Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nAn announcement from the ZeroSync Association highlights the promise of ZK-proofs for blockchain scalability and privacy by providing \u201calmost-fixed-size\u201d proofs verifying large computations.\n\nThe project\u2019s work pioneers the application of ZK-proofs for the Bitcoin network, with the organization describes Bitcoin\u2019s relative simplicity and the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model as a unique value proposition for applying recursive proofs.\n\nZeroSync notes that the ZK-Proof tools do not require consensus changes or additional trust assumptions for the Bitcoin network and its users. The organization is building a software development kit that will allow developers to generate custom validity proof for specific use cases without needing indepth domain expertise.\n\nZeroSync is in the process of building a client for fast initial block download as well as implementing the first complete proof of Bitcoin consensus. The client will allow users to sync a full node without making code changes to Bitcoin core.\n\nZeroSync is using the Cairo programming language, pioneered by StarkWare, to create STARK-provable programs for computations.\n\nZeroSync\u2019s tool is currently in a prototype state but has the ability to prove the validity of individual assumed valid blocks, which verify all Bitcoin rules except for scripts. The team also has a working in-browser demo verifier for STARK proofs of Bitcoin blocks.\n\nThe ZeroSync Association was initially funded by Geometry and StarkWare but is establishing a nonprofit entity to enable ongoing development and maintenance from stakeholders within the Bitcoin community.\n\nA statement from StarkWare president and co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson, who co-invented zk-STARKS, summed up the magnitude of ZK-proofs coming to the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\n\u201cAfter years of frustration about slow syncing, users will be able to sync with the network much faster, and with less computation. It\u2019s a technological leap akin to the transition from slow dial-up internet to high-speed broadband.\u201d\n\nLightning Labs, the team behind the Bitcoin layer-2 Lightning Network payment system, is a contributing partner to ZeroSync\u2019s project.\n\nThe firm intends to use ZeroSync to power compressed transaction history proofs for its Taproot Asset Representation Overlay (Taro) protocol, which aims to power the issuance of digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain."

All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies gained ground. XRP continued to lead the winners, while Cardano followed. U.S. equities moved lower on Tuesday on broader worries about interest rates and the economy and as regulators proposed stricter rules on the U.S. banking industry.\n\nSee related article: Asia leads crypto regulations, innovation may leave the US, says Ripple\u2019s Long\n\nBitcoin edged up 1.29% to US$27,290 in the 24 hours to 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, posting a weekly loss of 2.76%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The leading cryptocurrency see-sawed so far this week after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance for alleged violation of trading rules. Bitcoin dropped from around US$28,000 to a low of US$26,677 on Tuesday, and bounced back above the US$27,000 mark early Wednesday.\n\nEthereum also regained ground, rising 4.09% to US$1,776, but still down 0.78% for the past seven days.\n\nXRP continued to lead the winners, jumping 10.04% to US$0.5215 for a rise of 12.92% over the seven days.

The SEC charged Ripple with selling an unregistered security in the form of XRP.\n\n\u201cThe implications for the case are very broad-reaching for the crypto industry because we expect that this decision will ultimately set a precedent for how the U.S. government will look at categorizing crypto assets and regulating them,\u201d Ripple Labs President Monica Long told Forkast.News on Tuesday.\n\nCardano posted the second largest gain among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, jumping 6.68% to US$0.3678, but is still down 1.06% for the week.\n\nAdding to regulatory tensions, a U.S. judge ordered a hold on Binance\u2019s US$1.3 billion acquisition of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital, as requested by the Department of Justice that appealed an earlier court ruling to approve the sale.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.80% in the past 24 hours to US$1.15 trillion.

        "title": "How Irish farmers turn cow dung into digital gold (Bitcoin) - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "An Irish dairy farmer has found an unusual way to make use of the excess energy produced on his farm \u2014 by turning to Bitcoin (BTC) mining. Tom Campbell, who runs a farm in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, produces renewable energy using a method called anaerobic digestion. This involves breaking down biodegradable material to a point where it creates methane gas, which can be used to produce electricity.\n\nCampbell primarily uses the electricity to power his farm, but when there is excess energy that cannot be exported to the grid, he uses it to mine Bitcoin. Mining involves using specialized computers to solve complex mathematical equations, with successful miners rewarded with BTC. Bitcoin mining requires a lot of energy, and Campbell\u2019s farm produces up to 700 kilowatts of electrical output, equivalent to powering nearly 12,000 households.\n\nThe Irish government has set a goal to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030. However, the agricultural sector in Ireland is responsible for over 35% of these emissions, with cows being the primary source. With 7.3 million cows in the country, managing their waste in an eco-friendly manner is crucial. Anaerobic digestion is a promising solution, potentially generating enough electricity for every home in Ireland if 41% of farms adopted the technology. This could make a significant contribution to achieving the country's greenhouse gas emission targets.\n\nCampbell\u2019s decision to mine Bitcoin may seem unusual, but it makes sense from an economic perspective. When grid demand is low, miners can use the excess clean energy. By doing this, Campbell can sell the excess electricity to the grid as renewable, green electricity while profiting from Bitcoin mining.\n\nWhile some farmers have raised concerns that meeting greenhouse gas emission targets could drive them into bankruptcy, Campbell\u2019s approach shows that it is possible to find innovative solutions that benefit both the environment and the farmer\u2019s bottom line. With renewable energy sources such as anaerobic digestion becoming increasingly popular, more farmers could turn to Bitcoin mining in the future to make use of their excess energy.\n\nClick below to watch Campbell\u2019s exclusive interview with Cointelegraph to learn how he\u2019s transforming cow dung into digital gold."

        "content": "Bitcoin was down on Monday. Photo: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) dipped below the $27,000 mark after news emerged that Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is facing a US ban.\n\nBinance is being sued by the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC), which could also lead to a possible trading and registration ban in the US.\n\nBitcoin fell 3.4% after the CTFC announcement, which stated: \"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it has filed a civil enforcement action in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois charging Changpeng Zhao and three entities that operate the Binance platform with numerous violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChangpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao is the CEO of Binance, and the CFTC has accused him of encouraging Americans to \u201cevade compliance controls\u201d and breaking US law.\n\nThe Binance cryptocurrency exchange has also been accused of failing to properly register with the CFTC.\n\nThe impact of the CTFC investigation into Binance has added to already cautious investor sentiment pervading crypto markets, as traders await the outcome of the SEC's notice to Coinbase (COIN).\n\nBitcoin was down 3.4% to $26,935 on Monday.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) fell 3% to $1,712.\n\nThe annoucnement by the CTFC also contained a statement by CFTC chairman Rostin Behnam, who said: \u201cToday\u2019s enforcement action demonstrates that there is no location, or claimed lack of location, that will prevent the CFTC from protecting American investors.\n\n\"I have been clear that the CFTC will continue to use all of its authority to find and stop misconduct in the volatile and risky digital asset market.\n\n\u201cFor years, Binance knew they were violating CFTC rules, working actively to both keep the money flowing and avoid compliance.\n\n\"This should be a warning to anyone in the digital asset world that the CFTC will not tolerate willful avoidance of U.S. law. I applaud the diligent and dedicated work of the CFTC\u2019s Enforcement team in bringing this action, and for their hard work in addressing illegal operations in the digital asset space.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the news, the global cryptocurrency market cap was at $1.17tn, a fall of 2.8%, according to Coingecko data.\n\nCoinbase receives SEC Wells notice\n\nLast Wednesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Coinbase Global Inc with a Wells notice \u2014 a formal declaration that the regulator intends to recommend an enforcement action.\n\nShares in Coinbase (COIN) dropped nearly 13% to $67.83.\n\nIf the SEC officially classifies cryptocurrencies as securities it would impact the trade volume on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase by trade volume.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nAll cryptocurrencies, except bitcoin, would need to register with the SEC, and be forced to adopt technology systems to make their order books audit-compliant.\n\nThey would also face strict rules on order execution to prevent market manipulation.\n\nExchanges such as Coinbase could risk large fines from the SEC for listing cryptocurrencies that the regulator would deem as being unregistered securities.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler said he considers all cryptocurrencies securities except for bitcoin.\n\nCrypto market reaction to US Federal Reserve rate hike\n\nThe cryptocurrency market remained largely in the green after the Federal Reserve decided upon a less hawkish rate hike at last Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Fed's 0.25% increase takes the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of between 4.75%-5%.\n\n\u201cThe Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy,\u201d the FOMC\u2019s post-meeting statement said.\n\nRead more: 'Dressing digitally' pins hope on blockchain to clean up fashion's carbon footprint\n\n\u201cThe Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time.\u201c\n\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said: \"The process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrencies have historically reacted positively to lower interest rate environments, which can encourage more liquidity in global markets.\n\nWatch: Web3: Venture capital still pouring into crypto, claims head of Outlier Ventures | The Crypto Mile\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "Bitcoin touched a 10-day low and smaller cryptocurrencies also declined after Binance Holdings Ltd. was sued by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for allegedly breaking trading and derivatives rules.\n\nBinance, which exploded onto the crypto scene in 2017 and almost immediately took on and surpassed larger rivals, saw its market share surge after last November\u2019s collapse of FTX. It accounts for about 60% of crypto spot and derivatives trading volume. The company has argued that the global exchange is not subject to US jurisdiction because it has no headquarters."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Value vs. The Dollar Doesn't Matter (and Never Will) - CCN.com",
        "content": "Today I will extend to you three key reasons why the Bitcoin value versus the \u201cAlmighty Dollar\u201d is of little significance, and may be totally irrelevant both now, and in the future.\n\nOne reason can be from distilled from lessons learned in our history of decentralized networks versus other centralized networks. One can be realized through the present day landscape, and one looks into the future of money as we know it. So let\u2019s begin with our ability to learn from history.\n\nTwenty years ago, when the Internet was just starting to gain momentum, it was in a similar state of development as Bitcoin is in today. \u201cThe Web\u201d was replacing ancient communication methods like typewriters and snail mail at a slow, but steadily increasing rate. These wouldn\u2019t be instantly replaced, but would be one day irrelevant. As we moved along a few more years, and the 21st century dawned upon us, mainstream news magnets like CNN and the Washington Post joined \u201cThe Online Revolution.\u201d This caused newspapers to shrink in size, number and demand. As The Internet grew in scope, was it ever compared directly, on a daily basis, to the New York Times or Time Magazine in its relevance?\n\nJust as people today are asking \u201cWhat is Bitcoin?,\u201d people in 1994 were asking \u201cWhat is e-Mail?,\u201d and \u201cWhat is The Internet?\u201d Bitcoin is following the Internet\u2019s lead, in essence, building its own blockchain technology on top of the Internet\u2019s existing virtual blockchain, if you will. Bitcoin\u2019s growing influence on monetary systems and global commerce are set to be similar in depth to the Internet\u2019s inherent ability to change the way we all communicate worldwide. Bitcoin is not so much reinventing the wheel, although it may in the currency markets as it is setting the established wheel of the Internet in an exciting new direction. This potential will take another few years to realize fully how far Bitcoin value can go, but it is moving upward and onward, and the world is starting to take notice.\n\nBitcoin and Bitcoin value have scared some sovereign governments to the point that they have banned it outright, in practice, or through de facto capital controls. China attacking banks and account holders helped crash the BTC market at the beginning of this year. It has gone through the Mt.Gox fiasco, where trading bots were alleged to pump up the price of BTC, amounting to a market bubble. Also factor in Silk Road, the New York State Licensing controversy, and Alibaba\u2019s IPO, the Bitcoin value is still up over 200% in USD value from this time last year. That Bitcoin value has not only survived on a global basis for more than five years, but thrived, and attracted some of the largest merchants worldwide (PayPal, Dell Computers, Dish Network, etc.). This is much more relevant than any comparison to a currency that is in it\u2019s final years of relevance itself. If that doesn\u2019t prove the inherent strength of Bitcoin value, nothing will. What else has gained 200% or more in these market conditions?\n\nComparing Bitcoin value to the dollar\u2019s is like comparing a written letter to an email.\n\nThey may both transmit information or value, but that\u2019s where the comparisons should end. Today, merely out of desperation, Bitcoin value is compared to the World\u2019s Reserve Currency, the most liquid, most distributed, and most established currency of all time, the U.S. Dollar. We compare Bitcoin value to the dollar\u2019s because they\u2019re both seen as currencies, but Bitcoin value is much more than that. Currency is just Bitcoin\u2019s first \u201capp.\u201d It appreciates in the range of 2-400% per annum, and that\u2019s in the \u201coff year\u201d like this one. You can send 1000 bits of information within a Bitcoin. You can send millionths of a Bitcoin to someone as payment. The amount of Bitcoins produced is market capped. The distribution of Bitcoin is fully decentralized and is not bound by any primitive territories.\n\n\u201cThe Almighty U.S. Dollar\u201d, on the other hand, is kind of like Jack Nicholson, Bill Clinton, the late Joan Rivers, or any other superstar from generations gone by. They\u2019ve had their time in the sun, where they once ruled their market domain, and now they are fading into our history. The dollar\u2019s value is found at this point solely in its liquidity, it\u2019s history, and the ability of the U.S. to coerce smaller countries to use it at the business end of a gun. Just ask Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar is poised for a collapse of epic proportions, according to many experts. The \u201cGreat Recession\u201d of 2008-2009 was just foreplay. A currency\u2019s \u201cGlobal Reserve Currency\u201d status lasts anywhere from 65-70 years, on average, and the U.S. Dollar has been \u201cin office\u201d for over 70 years now. The sphere of influence of the U.S. Military worldwide, with well over 100 nations occupied by military bases, is the main thing keeping the dollar in business right now. But times are changing.\n\nThe BRICS Development Bank is a major regulatory step in advancing the demise of the dollar as an internationally relevant currency. BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China & South Africa) control 40% of the world\u2019s currency reserves and population. When they basically spit in the face of the U.S. Dollar in July, and said they would work directly with each other, and without the current Global Reserve Currency, the U.S. was strangely silent. These countries have been dealing in \u201cBilateral trade agreements \u201d (International trade deals without exchanging their currency for US Dollars) for many years now. So this new world bank of commerce was just the next logical step.\n\nThey did this because the dollar is of little intrinsic value, and the Fed can\u2019t seem to stop the bleeding. Federal Reserve officials have failed to get interest rates off of the pavement out of fear of collapsing the economy. They\u2019re on the monetary version of life support. The U.S. Government can doctor the numbers, and change the metrics, but countries worldwide are turning their back on the depreciating asset known as the US Dollar, and they know it. Their main job is to make sure you don\u2019t know it. You know what they say \u2013 ignorance is bliss. And that\u2019s also why the mainstream media only reports Bitcoin value drops, not the usual rise in Bitcoin value.\n\nMany financial experts like Peter Schiff , Jeff Berwick , Mike Maloney , Ron Paul , and Robert Kiyosaki (see links for more information) are predicting the mother of all economic collapses when the dollar inevitably falls. In my former dealings on Wall Street myself as an investment banker, I have to concur. Even legendary super-investor George Soros says the dollar died in 2008 . Americans in particular are truly ignorant about economic collapses because they have never experienced one first hand. What happened in 2008 was a small heart attack, that is a prelude to your coming demise, if you don\u2019t amend your ways. Has the U.S. done that, I ask you? Enough said. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\n\u201cEventually, this [dollar] will go to it\u2019s true worth. Zero. So all of you savers [of dollars] out there, you\u2019re going to lose big time!\u201d \u2013 Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad\n\nDoes this mean we won\u2019t use a dollar in the U.S.? No. We still use typewriters and snail mail. We still read newspapers.\n\nSort of. Not really. But when, not if, the dollar eventually collapses, and heads to it\u2019s true intrinsic value, Bitcoin value will have an inverse market relationship. It will then skyrocket to unimaginable heights, at least against \u201cThe Dying Dollar.\u201d As the dollar continues to slip and slide, Bitcoin will continue its march into the future. The way I see it, the only thing that can stop Bitcoin from outlasting the dollar on the global stage is if Bitcoin defeats itself. Governments attacking Bitcoin out of fear of it\u2019s abilities will only cause the \u201cStreisand Effect \u201d to be enabled in their populace.\n\nSo the Bitcoin value versus the dollar right now is irrelevant, since Bitcoin is not going to replace the \u201cWorld\u2019s reserve currency\u201d regardless. Ask Bitcoin industry leaders like Andreas Antonopoulos and Cameron Winklevoss, and they\u2019ll tell you the price doesn\u2019t matter. As Andreas once said on a Joe Rogan Podcast, the Internet\u2019s value is not measured in its ability to replace a number of fax machines. So why measure Bitcoin in dollars? They are totally different ecosystems. Like comparing apples to oranges, literally.\n\nBitcoin has more than held it\u2019s own in the face of great adversity over the last five years. Will the dollar, at the ripe old age of 70 years running in it\u2019s global position, stand up through the next five years? With the international community turning on it, the Fed overproducing it, and Bitcoin beating it through attrition and superior technology? Don\u2019t bet on it. The chances of the dollar going to zero in value in five years are at least even versus Bitcoin value doing the same. You may end up betting your bottom dollar on it, sooner than you think.\n\nImages from ObservationsandNotes.blogspot.com, Wikimedia Commons, Flickr and Shutterstock."

Well, look, regulators have certainly made it more difficult for of native companies to get access to banking. There are other regional banks that are stepping in selectively to fill the void. But the system is much less supportive than it used to be, and many are on the sidelines just waiting to see what happens.

And we decided to move our entire fleet from China to the United States because we felt that it was just too much jurisdictional risk to stay in China and ask we're moving our fleet midway through. China announced a ban on bitcoin mining. So we just accelerated that entire movement of the fleet into the United States, into the United States, which we felt was a safer place. So we continue to see that the pattern continues. You know, China had a go on bitcoin. Nothing happened. Bitcoin is not something you can destroy. It's a decentralized asset. Banning an entire industry does nothing to Bitcoin. It has no effect. I mean, but we are looking at other jurisdictions now, other countries. And we have to part of our jurisdictional diversification to diversify our risk forces us to look at other countries. Is it possible to get to know jurisdiction? Because it seems like that's what financial is trying to do. And it feels like that's where Bitcoin really belongs, but it doesn't seem possible with all of these governments working together. Look, we're pro regulation, but we want regulation to be well communicated and it can't just be simply carried out by enforcement on ambiguous rules. Bitcoin mining, for example, comprises a point two percent of global energy use and over 60 percent of that is sustainable. But politicians are unfairly painting the entire industry as some sort of dirty energy and are threatening these unwieldy taxes and outright bans. Forcing bitcoin mining out of the United States would simply transport the industry elsewhere. And it would just decrease the US's ability to pollute to be a powerhouse in this new industry. That's not going away. Well, you know, a lot of times people are terrified of things they can't understand. Sam, let me ask you about the price action we've seen, because it's been pretty impressive. You know, even after the collapse of RTX, even with the threat right now, although it's only a civil threat, we want to remind our viewers to buy an ounce, not a criminal threat. Nonetheless, it's not a great look. We still have Bitcoin trading at twenty seven thousand dollars. Is that because of low liquidity? I mean, somebody still has to lift the offer. How do you explain the price action? Yeah. Well, the loss of Silver Gate's exchange network and signatures Signet has certainly reduced the liquidity as market makers use these banks for 24/7 settlement. So there is a technical reason for the volume. However, there is also a logical reason why bitcoin is going up, and that's because Satoshi is thesis about the financial system having too much control and just can censor transactions and just having as you could see, banks are falling apart again. That happened in 2008. That is exactly when Satoshi invented bitcoin because he saw that the financial system had way too many holes and there he wanted to create a system where it was completely decentralized and foolproof. Bitcoin is a fail proof system. And so he invented that in the last banking crisis. And here we are again, another banking crisis. You'll see Bitcoin going up. Eventually, Bitcoin will be seen by a lot of people as digital gold. It's the ultimate way to hedge against macro bets, inflation and this sort of thing that's happening today. Well, and just like gold, it has to be mined. So one final question on Bitcoin miners, many of which we have seen come into pretty serious financial trouble. All right. Is the Bitcoin mining industry through the worst of it? What challenges do you still face? I agree with you. A lot of our peers, unfortunately, drank their their own Kool-Aid and and levered up and took on debt on their balance sheet while Bitcoin was going up through the roof. I think past fifty thousand people were really getting greedy. We did not we did no such thing. We have a very healthy, pristine balance sheet. We have over sixty five dollars on the balance sheet. We have absolutely no debt, but digital has no leverage, no capital commitments. So we ran a pretty conservative and tight ship and we're even in the business of potentially even lending to people in the industry who need the money because we have such a great balance sheet. Having said that, this is a lesson to be learned in the future for there will be another bull run. And you know, the industry needs to to run a business and run a business means you can't just hope on the direction of Bitcoin. You've got to run your business regardless of the direction of where bitcoin is going. All right, so what we do."

        "content": "Are cryptocurrencies commodities or securities? Depends on which US agency you ask Both the CFTC and SEC view bitcoin as a commodity for now, though\n\nIt\u2019s a confusing time to be a crypto company. The markets are volatile and trading activity is shaky right now, but the biggest problem for crypto firms seems to be that there\u2019s no clarity at the moment around the laws they\u2019re supposed to be in alignment with.\n\nTake, for instance, what the U.S. Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) considers crypto to be: In its lawsuit against the crypto exchange Binance and its CEO, the CFTC alleged the firm violated trading and derivative rules, and referred to the two largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, as commodities.\n\nPer the CFTC\u2019s filing against Binance, the regulator said certain digital assets, including bitcoin, ether, litecoin and \u201cat least two fiat-backed stablecoins,\u201d tether and the Binance USD, \u201cas well as other virtual currencies as alleged herein, are \u2018commodities.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe complaint also alleged that Binance and the respective parties charged \u201csolicited and accepted orders, accepted property to margin and operated a facility for the trading of futures, options, swaps and leveraged retail commodity transactions involving digital assets that are commodities.\u201d\n\nThis stance is \u201ca significant issue if the same company [and] exchange is sued by multiple agencies for the same tokens,\u201d Yankun Guo, partner at Chicago-based law firm Ice Miller, told TechCrunch+. \u201cThis stand is also a stark contrast to the position taken by the SEC and possibly weakens the SEC\u2019s argument that the tokens are securities.\u201d\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s viewpoint diverges from another major U.S. government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which views most crypto assets (aside from Bitcoin) as securities.\n\nEarlier this month, SEC Chair Gary Gensler told Bloomberg that the crypto market, while smaller than capital markets, is \u201cnot necessarily compliant\u201d compared to traditional finance.\n\nAt the SEC, there\u2019s \u201cone goal,\u201d Gensler said: \u201cFor them to come into compliance. [\u2026] They can call themselves crypto exchanges or lending or staking as a service or other intermediaries. [Our goal is for them] to come into compliance and ensure that they don\u2019t mislead the public or commingle the funds or take the publics\u2019 funds and do things we don\u2019t allow in our financial markets.\u201d\n\nGensler compared it to how the SEC doesn\u2019t allow the New York Stock Exchange to play with customers\u2019 funds, make markets, run hedge funds or be in the clearing business. \u201cWe separate out those conflicts,\u201d he added.\n\nThe CFTC and SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSo are cryptocurrencies commodities or securities? Well, it depends on who you ask. As someone who\u2019s been covering this space, I can empathize with firms offering crypto trading on this, as it feels wishy-washy. Almost like if your mom told you one thing, but your dad told you another. Who are you going to listen to?\n\nFor there to be fewer lawsuits, charges and so forth, there needs to be a concise stance from both agencies, but truth be told, I think that\u2019s unlikely for quite some time, given how slowly regulators in the U.S. move. It\u2019s a sticky position for companies to be in.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening in the United States, overall, we are in an unprecedented situation,\u201d said Jason Allegrante, chief legal and compliance officer at Fireblocks, a digital asset custody platform. \u201cA picture is emerging where every major prudential and markets regulator in the U.S. is coming out with enforcement against crypto businesses.\u201d\n\nJust last week, the SEC announced charges against Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, alleging he orchestrated \u201cunregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nThe SEC said it was suing Sun, the Tron foundation, the BitTorrent Foundation and BitTorrent (now referred to as Rainberry) over the sale of two tokens: TRON, or TRX, and BitTorrent, or BTT. Both TRX and BTT were referred to as unregistered crypto asset securities by the SEC, further fueling the debate on whether cryptocurrencies are, in fact, securities.\n\nThis lawsuit also came around the same time the SEC issued a Wells notice to Coinbase.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Coinbase executives took to Twitter Spaces on Thursday to discuss the decision.\n\n\u201cI think it is easy to look at the situation right now and conclude that the SEC is trying to change the game,\u201d Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, said during the Twitter chat. \u201cWhat\u2019s actually happening is the SEC is trying to cancel the game after it\u2019s been played. And so we think it\u2019s very important to keep a focus on what this means [longer term for Coinbase and the industry].\u201d\n\nIn the Coinbase filing on Wednesday, SEC language appeared to indicate that staking through a third-party service can run afoul of securities law. But the Coinbase Wells notice, alongside charges on crypto companies from the SEC and other agencies alike, may lead to more regulatory confusion if the agencies don\u2019t coincide on what is a security, commodity or neither.\n\n\u201cFor crypto, this is the worst of both worlds: one company with an SEC allegation, Coinbase, and one with a CFTC allegation, Binance,\u201d Allegrante said. \u201cHow are we supposed to understand what rules do or do not apply? With unclear regulation coming from two different sides, I\u2019m not sure how people are supposed to figure out what set to comply with, if it\u2019s possible to receive banking services, or if it\u2019s possible to have a crypto bank.\u201d\n\nUntil the agencies make clear decisions together, waters will continue to rise.\n\n\u201cThere is growing tension around how the CFTC and SEC are classifying certain tokens,\u201d Guo said. There are also fears that, in the future, companies could use the legal interpretations of one agency against the other. For example, stating the SEC has \u201cno authority to regulate in this area because crypto is a commodity per the CFTC,\u201d Guo added.\n\nThe CFTC affirming that these cryptocurrencies are commodities also creates greater tension and room for arguments that the agencies are contradicting one another, according to Jeffrey Blockinger, chief legal counsel for decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol.\n\n\u201cIt feels like the CFTC is strategically undercutting Chairman Gensler, which is unprecedented, at least, as far as I can recall,\u201d Blockinger said. \u201cMore importantly, though, the CFTC\u2019s position supports those of us who have been calling on Congress to exercise their responsibility to settle this interagency dispute through legislation.\u201d\n\nThis further makes the point that indecision and infighting within the federal government are discouraging innovation, Blockinger said.\n\n\u201cRegulatory agencies should not be competing against each other; they should be working together to create a collaborative framework that fosters innovation and protects investors,\u201d he added. \u201cWe clearly need the clarity that everyone is asking for. By the time it comes, the U.S. may very well be left behind.\u201d"

He predicts that Bitcoin is going to drop in price later this year and induce panic selling.\n\nWhy Benjamin Cowen predicts a BTC crash in 2023\n\nBenjamin Cowen, founder and editor-in-chief of Into The Cryptoverse, is known for his rigorous and scientific approach to cryptocurrency market analysis.\n\n\n\nFollowing the Ether (ETH) prediction, Cowen shared in a recent video, a fascinating analysis of the current market situation and his predictions for bitcoin. He stated that Bitcoin (BTC) will make a big move this year that will frighten a lot of people.\n\n\n\nAccording to Benjamin Cowen, the recent rise in the price of bitcoin, which has predicted an increase in the price of bitcoin to $100,000, is largely due to an influx of liquidity from the altcoin market into BTC.\n\n\n\nHowever, he predicts that when that liquidity dries up, the price of Bitcoin will fall. In fact, he expects BTC to fall back down later this year, which will scare off many individuals.\n\nWhy investors shouldn\u2019t panic\n\nWhile the expected decline of Bitcoin in 2023 has some investors worried, Benjamin Cowen encourages people not to panic.\n\n\n\nIn his opinion, this decline would be completely normal and should not discourage investors in the long run. He compares this situation to 2015 and 2019, when the price of BTC also fell before quickly recovering.\n\n\n\nAccording to Benjamin Cowen, investors should use this opportunity to strengthen their position before the next halving instead.\n\n\n\nHe also points out that interest rates have never been higher. However, the Fed will not be able to keep raising them indefinitely. So when quantitative easing starts up again, that will be a real argument in favor of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Benjamin Cowen points to recent events in the banking sector. Indeed, in the United States, three financial institutions that catered to companies in the technology and cryptocurrency sectors went bankrupt.\n\n\n\nThis economic turmoil has hit even Credit Suisse hard. Its rival UBS had to bail it out by buying its shares to avoid the collapse.\n\n\n\nFaced with this situation, many investors are gradually turning to bitcoin. For Cowen, these events are all arguments in favor of cryptocurrencies. He believes that they offer a credible alternative to traditional currencies. Especially in countries with high inflation, such as Argentina.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "title": "Bitcoin ATMs Hacked, Millions in Crypto Stolen as Threat Actors Exploit an Upload Vulnerability - CPO Magazine",
        "content": "A vulnerability in the interface that General Bytes bitcoin ATMs use to upload videos was found and exploited by thieves, leading to the theft of at least $1.5 million in crypto from user accounts.\n\nGeneral Bytes has over 15,000 of these bitcoin ATMs in circulation in over 100 countries, recognizable by their yellow face plates or touch screens with a \u201cBitcoin ATM\u201d logo across the bottom. The final amount of stolen crypto is still being tallied as investigations continue, but about 56 BTC has been confirmed taken from 15 operators in total.\n\nUpload interface flaw allows attackers to steal private keys from bitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs replicate some of the functionality of traditional bank ATMs, allowing users to \u201cwithdraw\u201d funds by selling some of their crypto on the spot via an exchange at whatever the current market rate is. It is less clear why these bitcoin ATMs might have a video upload function, but it is possibly due to some sort of planned marketing feature.\n\nWhatever the case, the attackers were able to exploit this feature to upload malicious JavaScript code. The attackers targeted bitcoin ATMs running on Digital Ocean, the cloud hosting provider that General Bytes recommends to ATM buyers (standalone management is also an option). They were able to intercept the API private keys that secure \u201chot\u201d crypto wallets online, in turn gaining the ability to disable two-factor authentication, change exchange passwords and raid accounts for their funds.\n\nA statement from General Bytes appeared to pass the buck for the crypto theft to individual owners of bitcoin ATMs that were exploited, saying that the ATM servers are meant to be behind a firewall and VPN to be protected from attacks and that only operators that were not using a VPN were impacted. General Bytes instructed all ATM owners to only connect the kiosks to the internet via a VPN, and also said that it is issuing a security fix.\n\nThe company also said that it was still investigating the incident and did not have final numbers in terms of crypto theft amounts, but that at least 56 BTC was stolen (about $1.5 million) from the total of at least 15 operators that were hit. However, other forms of crypto were also stolen in the attacks, so this tally is extremely likely to increase before this incident is wrapped up.\n\nJason Kent, Hacker in Residence for Cequence Security, notes that theft of API keys is a more general trend and has become a focal point for hackers: \u201cAs you can see, APIs have once again played a part in a massive successful attack. Why? Well, if one has an API Key for a coin trading platform, especially a privileged one like an ATM service would use, the attacker now owns the system. The overall target for this breach was to get control of the wallets and move coins. The pivot from attacking to withdrawing occurred once they had the API Keys they needed. As Kerckhoff teaches, the most important thing is how the key is handled, everything within a secure crypto system can be known \u2013 except the key. Persistent keys, even if encrypted, should be avoided. API Keys often persist far too long and grant far too many privileges.\u201d\n\nCrypto weaknesses emerge in new and untested technologies\n\nWhether it is decentralized finance or bitcoin ATMs, the biggest vulnerabilities in the crypto space seem to be emerging in relatively new technologies that have not yet been proven stable. Platforms and services often learn their lessons by suffering thefts of multiple millions of dollars.\n\nIn this case, the lesson General Bytes seems to be taking is that bitcoin ATMs cannot be properly secured via cloud services. It has since issued a statement saying that it is shuttering this option, requiring ATM owners going forward to set up standalone management to connect their kiosks to the internet. The company says that it will provide technical support to ATM owners who will need to migrate their servers, including setting up firewalls and VPNs.\n\nThis is also not the first serious security incident in recent history for General Bytes, or the first to involve bitcoin ATMs being exploited by a zero-day. In August 2022 an attacker compromised the company\u2019s Crypto Application Server (CAS) and created an admin account that in turn routed transactions at two-way ATMs to their own wallet.\n\nManufactured in Prague, the General Bytes bitcoin ATMs support over 60 types of crypto. One feature that they do not have, and that is not yet supported by the industry at large, is the ability to interface with more secure \u201ccold\u201d wallets. The closest compromise is the use of a \u201cpaper wallet,\u201d supported by some ATM types, which allows users to generate a QR code from their own wallet which can then be scanned at an ATM. Paper wallets create their own security hazard, however, are private keys are generally printed on one side.\n\nThis particular incident seems as if it would have been readily avoided by having a system in place to ensure that uploads through the video system were in fact videos before being accepted; crypto consumers are likely left wondering if other bitcoin ATM brands also have this sort of \u201cfeature\u201d hidden in them. It also raises questions about the overall value of these machines, given that they generally cost the user anywhere from 7% to a whopping 20% in transaction fees.\n\nNick Percoco, Chief Security Officer of Kraken, notes that bitcoin ATMs are not the only option for funds access: \u201cIncidents like this reinforce the importance of promptly addressing attack vectors. Kraken Security Labs identified several hardware, software and backend vulnerabilities in General Bytes ATMs as early as 2021. We hope those impacted are not deterred from continuing their journey in the crypto ecosystem. For those continuing to access Bitcoin via retail outlets, we recommend transacting via trusted vendors. There are trusted alternatives to ATMs worth considering, such as digital asset trading platforms, that also provide secure access points to the crypto asset class.\u201d"

This move should also be manageable as renewable energy is usually more affordable and helps profit margins for miners.\n\nDelve deeper into DailyCoin\u2019s crypto news:\n\nNvidia CTO Deems Crypto Useless While Advocating for ChatGPT AI\n\nForbes 30 Under 30\u2019s Norman Wooding: Crypto Landscape Has Changed"

        "title": "Introduction to Bitcoin Ordinals - Coinspeaker",
        "content": "The creation of Bitcoin ordinals is a thoughtful and innovative development for the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. It has gained massive adoption from several blockchain enthusiasts and onlookers within a short time. The following guide describes Bitcoin ordinals and how they function.\n\nSince the inception of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), many have begun to wonder about the correlation between a random digital item and the blockchain. In 2021, NFTs gained massive popularity generating over two billion dollars in revenue and finding numerous use cases. However, the Bitcoin (BTC) network could not cause any due to the rigidity of its build. Other blockchain networks like Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), and Cardano (ADA), among others, accommodated the minting and trading of NFTs. Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s cryptocurrency initially focused on improving the speed, anonymity, and flexibility of financial transactions. However, many users opposed Bitcoin\u2019s concentration on transactional activities against the multi-functionality of Ethereum, a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contracts.\n\nAfter several agitations, Bitcoin received several tweaking forks, thereby increasing the diversity of the blockchain. These forks include SegWit, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond (BTCD), Classic, Bitcoin Cash ABC, Bitcoin Cash SV, Taproot, and many others. Bitcoin ordinals, a recent upgrade developed by Casey Rodarmor, will allow users to inscribe metadata in images, JSON, and texts into satoshis. Satoshi is a fraction of a whole Bitcoin; there are 100 million satoshis in 1 BTC. This significant fork could be the birth of NFTs minting on the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. Interestingly, Bitcoin ordinals function on a different mechanism from the conventional NFT. Below we will discuss how.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals Defined\n\nBitcoin ordinals, alternatively called Bitcoin NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on the satoshi. As earlier stated, a satoshi is the lowest denomination of Bitcoin. Basically, these digital artifacts are \u201csats\u201d that have been ordered and inscribed with a piece of information. These pieces of information transformed an ordinary satoshi into a de-facto NFT. Before the emergence of Bitcoin ordinals, other NFT attempts on the Bitcoin blockchain include Counterparty (2014) and Stacks (2017). Bitcoin NFTs were introduced in January 2023.\n\nHow Do Bitcoin Ordinals Work?\n\nBitcoin ordinals arose from contention among the Bitcoin community over the monotonous function of the blockchain. The lack of diversity in the Bitcoin blockchain was caused by its meager transaction size of 80 bytes which could barely contain text messages. The upgrade implemented through SegWit and Taproot turned things around by increasing Bitcoin transaction size to almost 4MB. These upgrades allow for a refined arrangement of transactional data.\n\nUsers can identify the position of sitting according to four parameters:\n\nThe index of sat in the block.\n\nThe index of the block in the difficulty adjustment period x/2016.\n\nThe index of the block in halving epoch x/210,000.\n\nThe cycle number.\n\nThis arrangement implies that a preceding sat is rarer than the immediate successive sat. In technical terms, ordinal uses remodeled codes as an envelope for data inscribed onto sats.\n\nOrdinal Inscriptions\n\nOrdinal inscriptions are metadata of digital artifacts written on sats; they do not require a sidechain or a separate token. The direct presence on the blockchain is one of the contrasts between Bitcoin NFTs and Ethereum-based NFTs. These data are stored in taproot script-path spend scripts under the storage of 4MB.\n\nThrough a two-step process, anyone can generate an ordinal inscription. To begin with, users should create a taproot output with inscription content. After that, they can spend the output to reveal the inscription content on the blockchain. The inscription content is enveloped in a type of no-op that does not change the script. Considering the ordinal theory, inscriptions can be transferred, traded, and recovered. The ordinal theory defines satoshis (sats) as the atomic unit that can be identified and traded individually on the Bitcoin network.\n\nInscriptions can be traded on the Ordinal Punks website. Users can explore the ordinals\u2019 Discord channel. Gamma.io, the leading marketplace on Stacks, plans to unveil a paid marketplace where users can generate and trade inscriptions (text or images). Oridalsbot, a product designed by the creators of the Satoshibles NFT collection, also performs similar services. Some wallets like Xverse, Hiro wallet, and Sparrow wallet are currently rolling out support for Bitcoin NFT. A specialized wallet like Ordwallet can receive ordinals, create inscriptions and prevent accidental spending by freezing individual sats. To run an Ordwallet, users require a full Bitcoin node and 500 GB of disk space.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals vs Traditional NFTs\n\nBitcoin ordinals look relatively similar to traditional NFTs, intersecting in the ability to incorporate digital items. From a more technical standpoint, there are several differences between the two digital assets. Bitcoin ordinals can be found on-chain as all raw data are directly written on the blockchain. On the other hand, NFTs are minted separately as a new token that could have references to files on other blockchains.\n\nBitcoin currently has a hard cap of 21M total supply and a 4MB limit. These stats could hinder the amount of Bitcoin NFT mint if all space was used as ordinals. NFTs on other blockchains have a more flexible and expansive minting space. The Bitcoin space uniquely differs from Ethereum and has no smart contracts, decentralized exchange, or easily accessible wallets. It has a poor UI restricting trading of ordinal to over-the-counter. Regardless, ordinal trading has gathered attention from many users.\n\nThe rarity of a traditional NFT is solely determined by the attributes of the artwork, which invariably affects the asset\u2019s price. For Bitcoin ordinals, rarity might depend on the order of minting. Collectors can decide to have a flare for the first 1000 sats mint. It is possible for Casey Rodarmor\u2019s inscription of \u201ctiny pixel art\u201d of a skull, popularly known as Genesis Block, could be worth millions of dollars in the next few years.\n\nFinally, traditional NFT can regulate the kind of content generated, unlike Bitcoin, a permissionless sphere where the inscription on sats cannot be censored. This means users can freely generate permanent illicit and copyrighted content.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals\u2019 Use Cases\n\nThe use cases of Bitcoin ordinals are very scanty at the moment. Their limited block size will significantly restrict their functionality against NFT-diversified use cases. For example, inscribing a game into a Bitcoin Ordinal is quite unfeasible due to the 4MB transaction size. Future exploration of Bitcoin Ordinals could revolve around the following: music, fashion, metaverse, supply chain, luxury products, and artworks.\n\nMost Popular Bitcoin NFT Collections\n\nWithin a short period, several Bitcoin NFT collections have surfaced. Amidst the numerous, here are a few popular Bitcoin NFT collections:\n\nOrdinal Punks \u2013 a collection of 100 NFTs minted within the first 650 inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain. It has a minimum bid price of 3.7 BTC and a maximum bid price of 50 BTC.\n\nTaproot Wizard \u2013 a creation by Udi Wertheimer consisting of an ordinal collection of hand-drawn NFT wizards.\n\nBitcoin Rock \u2013 a collection of 100 supply-capped NFTs featuring the aesthetic and spirits of Ether Rock, one of the first NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nTimechain Collection \u2013 a limited set of 21 ordinals depicting various forms of timepieces. These timepieces vary in rarity as Pocket Watches, Ancient Sundials, Wristwatches, Wall Clocks, Cyberpunk Alarm Clocks, Clock Towers, Monolith, and Grandfather Clocks.\n\nOrdinal Loops \u2013 this NFT is popularly known as Object 0; it is a rotating mathematical torus and is one of just seven similar animations in the first collection from Ordinal Loops. It was auctioned for 7.156 BTC ($156,500).\n\nBenefits and Challenges\n\nHere are some important benefits that accompany the introduction of Bitcoin ordinals. These digital artifacts will increase Bitcoin use cases, the number of users, and the adoption rate. Ordinals creator campaign is saying: \u201cCome for fun, rich art, stay for the decentralized digital money.\u201d Unlike Ethereum NFT, ordinal transactions are more decentralized, immutable, well-secured, and transparent. Assets are directly pegged to the blockchain with relatively cheaper transactional fees costing $50 to 1M bytes.\n\nThe violation of copyright and privacy might pose a serious threat to Bitcoin ordinals, thereby enabling the growth of malware. At the moment, there is no regulatory mechanism on the open network. For many Bitcoin core developers, the introduction of Bitcoin ordinals has deviated from its initial financial mission.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe creation of Bitcoin ordinals is a thoughtful and innovative development for the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. It has gained massive adoption from several blockchain enthusiasts and onlookers within a short time. Nevertheless, it must be treated cautiously, as exploitation is bound to occur. Hopefully, it will expand and maximize the utility of the Bitcoin network shortly."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network may be inching closer toward mainstream adoption, as LDK\u2014one of the main implementations of the network\u2014sets forth on an ambitious new roadmap to improve functionality and accessibility for users.\n\nLightning Development Kit, also known as LDK, is a project from Bitcoin open-source development entity Spiral, which is funded by Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block. LDK plays a significant role on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, and the project\u2019s team recently showcased tech improvements during a Twitter Spaces that they plan to work on over the next year.\n\nIt\u2019s significant given the belief among Bitcoin supporters that if anything takes Bitcoin mainstream, it'll be the Lightning Network, which makes payments cheaper, faster, and more scalable. But though the Lightning Network is functional, it's rough around the edges and is not always easy for new users to send payments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor one, there\u2019s a difference between custodial and non-custodial mobile Lightning wallets. Custodial wallets require the user to trust the wallet provider with the funds, while non-custodial wallets give wallets sole control over their own funds.\n\n\u201cThe Lightning Network is a pretty good user experience today for custodial Lightning Network wallets. However, there remain substantial problems with UX, privacy, and scaling for non-custodial Lightning wallets,\u201d Spiral lead Steve Lee told Decrypt.\n\nThe LDK roadmap, compiled of a number of features, aims to tackle this problem\u2014with the goal of making the Lightning Network more appealing to mainstream users.\n\n2023 Lightning Development Kit. Source: LDK\n\nBitcoin UX improvements\n\nLDK is different from LND and C-lightning, the most-used software implementations of the Lightning Network. The LDK team aims to be more modular and flexible to make developers' lives easier when building (particularly mobile) Lightning wallets and apps. And there are two features on the roadmap, in particular, that are unique to LDK.\n\nThough LDK isn't a node per se, developers can build custom Lightning nodes that suit their needs with it. But the freedom LDK provides is too intimidating for developers who are newer to building on the network, Lee noted in the Twitter spaces.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA key feature on the roadmap is LDK Node Mobile, which offers an easier set-up for creating a node. Nodes are a key piece of any Lightning app. They connect the app to the rest of the network, allowing users to send and receive payments. Instead of it taking developers days or weeks to build a node with LDK, Lee argues LDK Node will shrink down this time to hours.\n\nAnother unique feature LDK is working on is what's called \"async payments.\" One of the irritating problems mobile users of Lightning face is if they try to send a mobile payment to a friend, the friend needs to be online to receive the payment, otherwise the payment will fail. Hovering over a phone to wait for a payment sort of defeats the purpose of Lightning-speed payments. Users don't have to deal with this issue when sending a Venmo payment, so why the need with Bitcoin?\n\nSpiral developer and long-time Bitcoin contributor Matt Corallo released a proposal for dodging this problem in 2021. And as the LDK roadmap shows, putting async payments into practice is a chief focus for the LDK team over the next year.\n\nLightning's decentralized future\n\nThen there's a slew of other changes LDK developers are working on that will boost usability of the payment system. If you've been following the whirlwind of Bitcoin and Lightning Network development, you might have heard of some of them, since other implementations are also adopting these changes to make them more widespread.\n\nLDK is working on adopting BOLT 12, a proposal for making it easier to invoice and accept Lightning payments. It's a mishmash of features with uncomfortably technical names (like \"onion messages\" and \"blinded paths\"). But the short of it is that BOLT 12 will allow for a better user experience where users can reuse Lightning invoices to accept payments. BOLT 12 also boosts privacy. With \u201cblinded paths\u201d a user can accept payments without revealing their identity. Normally, the sender knows the public key, which is the identity of the node they are sending a payment to. But with blinded paths, this information is shielded.\n\nAnother big win is coming support for privacy feature Taproot. In 2021, Taproot was Bitcoin's largest upgrade in years. Slowly, the effects of Taproot are rippling out to Bitcoin projects like Lightning. Taproot will shield Lightning transactions, giving them invisibility so that they look exactly the same as normal Bitcoin transactions. If you look on a block explorer to see all Bitcoin transactions ever made, Lightning transactions usually stand out, since they use a technique called \u201cmulti-sig.\u201d This can typically be detected since the data will look more complicated than a normal Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThat\u2019s just scratching the surface of the roadmap. \u201cThere is no doubt it is an ambitious roadmap,\u201d Lee told Decrypt, noting that time estimates for development projects can be \u201ctricky.\u201d But it provides an accurate window into what Lightning Network developers will be working on in the near-term.\n\nLightning developers have plenty of work ahead of them. Improvements to the network are as sprawling as the network itself. But with every change they make a piece is put into place to transform Bitcoin into an easier to use payment system.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

I\u2019ve spent my entire career trying to reduce real-world physical waste, and PoW felt intuitively wasteful. Of course, I was wrong. Few things in the world are black and white. Dumb me. /4 \u2014 Von Wong (@thevonwong) March 25, 2023\n\nThe \u201cSkull of Satoshi\u201d was unveiled last week as part of the year-long campaign helmed by Greenpeace, the international environmental NGO, which seeks to highlight \u201cthe enormous climate impact\u201d of Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe initiative, supported by the other environmental organizations and the likes of Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, is called \u201cChange the Code, Not the Climate\u201d and seeks to move Bitcoin to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (Pos) mechanism. The move would mean changing the leading cryptocurrency's underlying code.\n\nAfter the fierce backlash the idea received from the Bitcoin community, Greenpeace now says that it's \"not necessarily suggesting that Bitcoin should switch to some existing form of PoS.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are pointing to the fact that other cryptocurrencies realized that PoW has an energy problem and changed,\u201d Rolf Skar, special projects manager at Greenpeace USA, told Decrypt. \u201cBitcoin is the laggard in this area and is sticking to decade-old technology while other newer cryptocurrencies are using different consensus mechanisms and cutting their carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nAs for the artist himself, Von Wong said that he spent the last few days speaking to various members of the Bitcoin community and now wants \u201cto take a pause and refrain from participating in more public discourse and spend more time quietly and privately observing and learning until I know exactly how my contributions can objectively contribute to helping the environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI needed to first string together some official responses to the Twitterverse and had been trying to digest all the different fragments of information that I was receiving from various places,\u201d Von Wong told Decrypt. \u201cI'm trying to better understand the nuance between progress and perfection.\u201d\n\nChanging the Bitcoin\u2014mission impossible?\n\nAccording to Greenpeace, which earlier hinted that transitioning Bitcoin to PoS would require a soft fork, the organization is \u201coptimistic about technological innovation and human creativity, so we aren\u2019t going to throw up our hands and declare that this is 'impossible.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis demands that we all\u2013not just Greenpeace or Bitcoin\u2013find ways to ensure a just and green future. We regularly work on issues that are objectively more complicated and difficult to figure out than changing Bitcoin\u2019s code,\" Skar told Decrypt. \"It is only impossible if we refuse to try.\u201d\n\nPeople working closely with Bitcoin, however, are far less optimistic.\n\n\u201cEvery node in the Bitcoin network verifies the new block header to be smaller than the given number, defined by mining difficulty. If you change that rule, all nodes that don't want to update to a new software version will fall off the consensus. That effectively will create a hard fork situation,\u201d Viacheslav Zhygulin, co-founder and CTO of stroom.network, a liquid staking protocol for the Bitcoin Lightning Network, told Decrypt.\n\nAccording to Zhygulin, while Bitcoin\u2019s open-source code allows anyone to make changes, all major upgrades to the Bitcoin network over the past decade, including SegWit and Taproot, have been executed as soft forks, and that there are \u201cno chances\u201d for a successful hard fork any time soon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnlike soft forks, hard forks are not backward-compatible and require all node operators on the network to update to the latest software at a specified time.\n\n\u201cThere is virtually no chance that a hypothetical Bitcoin on PoS would be accepted as the original Bitcoin, and it's highly improbable that it would ever come into existence,\u201d Phil Harvey, the CEO of Bitcoin mining consulting firm Sabre56, told Decrypt.\n\nAccording to Harvey, the Bitcoin code has been designed \u201cto be practically impossible to change,\u201d as doing so requires agreement from all network participants.\n\n\u201cIn the past, factions of nodes have hard-forked the code, but the resulting coins have not been considered Bitcoin anymore. This rigid design is largely due to the core developer and early adopter group's ideological commitment to the principles of sound money. While they might abandon Bitcoin, it's highly unlikely that they would ever switch to a PoS system,\u201d said Harvey.\n\nThe Sabre56 founder also said that the value of digital assets stems from their ability to solve financial and other problems.\n\n\u201cBitcoin's use case as a sound, decentralized, immutable, uncensored, globally accessible, and self-custodied reserve currency is intrinsically connected to PoW. Its pillars, such as the halving cycles, mining economics, and block validation, all rely on this consensus mechanism,\" Harvey told Decrypt. \"Introducing PoS to the Bitcoin network would change its entire identity and value proposition.\u201d"

        "title": "Trader Chris Dunn talks Bitcoin and inflation on the latest Crypto Trading Secrets podcast - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Cointelegraph has released Episode 8 of its Crypto Trading Secrets podcast, featuring an interview with trader, investor, podcaster and YouTuber Chris Dunn, who touts experience in mainstream markets as well as about 10 years of activity in the crypto space. The trader and investor answered questions asked by host Benjamin Pirus during the episode\u2019s March 14 recording, giving his opinions on the role Bitcoin (BTC) plays as an asset and why he thinks people are willing to buy the coin, plus much more.\n\nDunn mentioned that he thinks COVID-19 got mainstream, non-crypto folks to ponder the United States money system, including questioning how the government can create trillions of dollars and whether or not to trust the U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cThen kind of the second thing is, okay, we\u2019ve got some bank failures happening right now. We\u2019ve got inflation going through the roof, and people are getting squeezed,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nOver the course of 2022, inflation hit significant levels across the globe. In March 2023, Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank all went under. These three players all had involvement in the crypto sector. Dunn explained:\n\n\u201cMillennials and younger are going, \u2018Hey, I make a good income, I work really hard, but why can\u2019t I afford the average house in my town or city?\u2019 and \u2018What happened there, and what can I do to build my wealth? How can I beat this inflation monster?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where Bitcoin comes in. At least so far, it\u2019s proven to just really have a great compound annual growth rate,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cIt\u2019s outpaced inflation really, really well,\u201d he continued. \u201cWill that happen into the future? That\u2019s yet to be seen, but it\u2019s proven itself so far over the past decade-plus to be a great store of wealth, even taking into consideration the depths of the bear markets.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201cAdjusted for volatility, Bitcoin is still one of the best-performing assets on the planet. So, I think people are waking up to the idea that maybe fiat isn\u2019t the best form of money and maybe there is a better way to store our wealth.\u201d\n\nSince its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has increased in price from less than $1,000 to more than $65,000 per coin at its peak, but it has also suffered dramatic drawdowns. In 2017, BTC increased in price from around $1,000 all the way to nearly $20,000 \u2014 and then plummeted down below $5,000 in 2018. It then surged past $65,000 in 2021 before falling back below $20,000 in 2022, according to Cointelegraph\u2019s Bitcoin price index. This type of turbulence makes the question of whether or not it\u2019s a store of value a point of argument, given that buying at the wrong time could lead to significant losses.\n\nDunn also gave his take on a number of other questions during the episode and talked about his background.\n\nCheck out this and other episodes from Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast on Cointelegraph\u2019s podcast page, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts or TuneIn.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm and major Bitcoin (BTC) investor, is acquiring more BTC amid the recent cryptocurrency market recovery.\n\nMicroStrategy co-founder and former CEO Michael Saylor took to Twitter on March 27 to announce that the firm has repaid its $205 million loan to Silvergate.\n\nCiting a form 8-K filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Saylor stressed that MicroStrategy repaid the Silvergate loan at a 22% discount.\n\nThe company also acquired a significant stash of Bitcoin, purchasing 6,455 BTC for $150 million, or at an average price of $23,238 per coin as of March 23, the former CEO said. According to the filing, MicroStrategy acquired its latest batch of Bitcoin between Feb. 16, 2023 and March 23, 2023.\n\nWith the purchase, MicroStrategy has increased its total Bitcoins holdings to 138,955 BTC, bought for $4.1 billion at an average of $29,817 per coin, Saylor said.\n\nMicroStrategy repaid its $205M Silvergate loan at a 22% discount. As of 3/23/23, $MSTR acquired an additional ~6,455 bitcoins for ~$150M at an average of ~$23,238 per #bitcoin & held ~138,955 BTC acquired for ~$4.14B at an average of ~$29,817 per bitcoin. https://t.co/ALp9VLkTpt \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) March 27, 2023\n\nAs previously announced, MicroStrategy\u2019s subsidiary MacroStrategy received a $205 million term loan from Silvergate Bank under its Silvergate Exchange Network Leverage program in March 2022. The loan was collateralized by certain Bitcoin owned by MacroStrategy and had a scheduled maturity date of March 23, 2025.\n\nUnder the terms of the credit agreement, MacroStrategy was required to maintain a loan to collateral value ratio of less than 50%. On March 24, 2023, MacroStrategy and Silvergate entered into a prepayment, waiver and payoff to credit and security agreement, with MacroStrategy voluntarily prepaying Silvergate around $161 million in full repayment.\n\n\u201cUpon Silvergate\u2019s receipt of the payoff amount, the credit agreement was terminated, and Silvergate released its security interest in all of MacroStrategy\u2019s assets collateralizing the loan, including the Bitcoin that was serving as collateral,\u201d the filing reads.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK loading up on Coinbase shares again, buying $18M\n\nIn the filing, MicroStrategy also mentioned that the company entered into an agreement with two companies \u2014 Cowen and Company and BTIG \u2014 to sell its aggregated class A common stock worth $500,000,000. According to the latest updates, MicroStrategy issued and sold an aggregate of 1,348,855 shares under the sales agreement for aggregate net proceeds to MicroStrategy of roughly $339 million.\n\nThe latest Bitcoin acquisition by MicroStrategy is apparently the first such transaction so far in 2023. The previous purchase took place in late December 2023, with MicroStrategy buying 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,181 for a total of $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21.\n\nMicroStrategy did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.

        "title": "The 'Skull of Satoshi' Proves Bitcoin Mining Discourse Isn't Dead - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nLast week, Benjamin Von Wong unveiled an art installation he was commissioned to create by Greenpeace USA for its \u201cChange the Code, Not the Climate\u201d campaign. The $5 million campaign is funded by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and aims to change Bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm through a \u201ccode change\u201d in order to save the environment.\n\nThe idea being that PoW uses energy and other consensus algorithms do not.\n\nThis article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\n\nVon Wong\u2019s art piece was revealed Thursday, March 23, in a blog post and video. He calls it the \u201cSkull of Satoshi\u201d \u2013 an apt name for an 11-foot tall skull made of wood, recycled styrofoam and 300+ pieces of electronic waste. The skull also features red laser eyes, a nod to the Bitcoin Twitter community who wear laser eyes in their profile pictures.\n\nInstead of enraging the Bitcoin community, as Greenpeace's campaign normally does, the Skull was almost immediately generally embraced because it was really cool.\n\nI mean, just look at how metal, how punk rock the whole art installation is. It\u2019s literally an 11-foot skull with glowing red laser eyes and smokestacks growing out the top. What\u2019s not to love?\n\nBitcoiners tweeted about how much they liked the Skull of Satoshi and some changed their Twitter profile pictures. Still there was hesitation from others to embrace the art because of where the money behind it came from. From that angle, Von Wong was lambasted.\n\nWithout getting into too much detail, the conversation about moving Bitcoin from proof-of-work to something else, like proof-of-stake (PoS), which doesn\u2019t use much energy, is generally a nonstarter. Bitcoin will almost certainly never move away from proof-of-work. That isn\u2019t obvious from the outside, so that\u2019s exactly where Von Wong began his journey to understand bitcoin mining.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a reflective tweet thread, Von Wong said he thought the Bitcoin environmental problem was \u201cblack and white.\u201d After the \u201cphenomenal accident\u201d of the Skull of Satoshi, Von Wong spent time in conversation with environmentalist bitcoiners including Level39, Troy Cross and Daniel Batten. He now recognizes that Bitcoin can be a powerful force for improving the environment.\n\nThis creates a somewhat interesting parallel. Greenpeace will still presumably use the Skull of Satoshi to promote its \u201cchange the code\u201d campaign, but it will work everywhere except on the internet where the skull has become somewhat of a mascot for Bitcoin\u2019s environmental potential even without moving its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work.\n\nThe story here is that Von Wong went from \u201cthere\u2019s only one way to fix Bitcoin\u2019s environmental problem\u201d to \u201cactually, there are many ways to fix Bitcoin\u2019s environmental problem\u201d in the space of a few days. It\u2019s not a story because Von Wong is someone big, important or special. It\u2019s a story because as more and more people get interested in Bitcoin the environmental question will certainly come up again and again. And bitcoiners will, and must, be ready to engage constructively.\n\nFor someone who has been around Bitcoin for a while, I viewed Von Wong\u2019s learning process around the nuances of bitcoin mining as honestly unsurprising. The fact that it was carried out in what seemed like a relatively nonabrasive way bodes well for onboarding future environmentalist-leaning bitcoiners.\n\nIf Bitcoin is to succeed, we need more bitcoiners. And because Bitcoin and environmentalism are not mutually exclusive, there are ways for PoW blockchains to be a positive force.\n\nBitcoin is for everyone, including environmentalists."

The cryptocurrency BNB, which powers the Binance\u2019s BNB chain, was down more than 6%.\n\nMany crypto-related stocks were down even more.\n\nShares of competing crypto exchange Coinbase fell just over 10% following the news. The company has recently run into its own regulatory trouble, with the Securities and Exchange Commission issuing a Wells Notice to the exchange related to \u201caspects of the Company\u2019s exchange, our staking service Coinbase Earn, and Coinbase Wallet after a cursory investigation,\u201d Coinbase said last week.\n\nShares of MicroStrategy, the Bitcoin \u201chodling\u201d company founded by Michael Saylor, were also down more than 7% on Monday afternoon. In a tweet on Monday, Saylor said that the company had repaid a $205 million loan to collapsed crypto bank Silvergate at a 22% discount. Saylor added that the company spent around $150 million on 6,455 more Bitcoin tokens to bring its total holdings to 138,955, worth about $3.7 billion at current prices.\n\nMicroStrategy repaid its $205M Silvergate loan at a 22% discount.

        "content": "If you think the news is fake, how bad do you think the histories are?\n\nA conspiracy theory is like a tangled ball of yarn that a group of curious kittens unraveled, weaving an intricate web of mystery and intrigue\u2014often chaotic, but usually at least a little bit compelling. Some are tales so mind-boggling that they make soap opera plotlines seem mundane, involving everything from secret societies to undercover aliens. They are the \u201cwhodunit\u201d of alternative explanations, where the clues are often dubious, the logic sometimes stretches reality, and the endings are rarely satisfying.\n\nIn short, a conspiracy theory is a rollercoaster ride of suspense and surprise, where you\u2019re never quite sure what\u2019s fact, fiction, or just plain bonkers.\n\nBut a great many conspiracy theories do indeed end up being revealed to be true, and this is where real investigative journalism is needed.\n\nPrecedent\n\nOne of the most well-documented government conspiracy theories that was later proven to be true is the Watergate scandal. During the presidency of Richard Nixon, a break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters occurred at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., in June 1972.\n\nThe break-in was carried out by men who were eventually linked to Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign. The Nixon administration initially denied, then tried to cover up the scandal, but investigative journalism by The Washington Post and other media outlets eventually uncovered a vast network of political espionage, sabotage, and illegal activities conducted by individuals connected to the White House.\n\nAs the evidence mounted, it became clear that high-ranking officials, including President Nixon himself, were involved in the cover-up. This led to a series of investigations, criminal prosecutions, and high-profile resignations, including the resignation of the President himself in 1974.\n\nThe Watergate scandal is a prime example of a government conspiracy that was initially dismissed as a baseless theory but was ultimately proven to be true. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of a free press and the role it plays in holding powerful institutions accountable.\n\nLet\u2019s get a little spicier\u2026\n\nThe existence of the MK-ULTRA program first came to light in 1973, when the CIA officially halted the project. Further details about MK-ULTRA were uncovered during a series of investigations by the U.S. Congress in the mid-1970s. In 1975, the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission both investigated the CIA\u2019s activities, including the MK-ULTRA program, and exposed numerous unethical and illegal practices. These investigations brought the MK-ULTRA program into the public eye and confirmed its reality.\n\nFor 20 years, MK-ULTRA was a top-secret CIA program that was focused on researching mind control, chemical interrogation, and other forms of psychological manipulation. The project was initiated in response to concerns about the potential use of mind control by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nThe MK-ULTRA program involved conducting experiments on both animals and humans, often without the subjects\u2019 knowledge or consent. Some of the experiments involved the use of hallucinogenic drugs, such as LSD, as well as other chemicals, electroconvulsive therapy, sensory deprivation, and various forms of psychological manipulation. The goal was to discover methods to control or influence human behavior for intelligence and military purposes.\n\nClaims about MK-ULTRA were deemed conspiracy theories for nearly a generation, but they were ultimately discovered to be largely true. The CIA was ultimately subjected to new oversight and restrictions, and the U.S. government issued formal apologies to the victims of the MK-ULTRA experiments.\n\nWhat about corporate conspiracies?\n\nTobacco Industry: Tobacco companies suppressed information about smoking\u2019s harmful health effects for decades. They funded research that downplayed risks, manipulated public opinion, and lobbied against regulations.\n\nVolkswagen Emissions Scandal: In 2015, Volkswagen rigged millions of diesel vehicles with software to cheat emissions tests. The scandal led to substantial fines and criminal charges.\n\nSugar Industry: In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research to shift heart disease blame from sugar to fat. The Sugar Research Foundation even paid Harvard researchers to downplay the link between sugar and heart disease, promoting saturated fat as the main culprit.\n\nPurdue Pharma Opioid Crisis: Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, marketed the drug as safe and effective for chronic pain, downplaying its addictive nature. Their deceptive marketing played a significant role in the opioid crisis, which has claimed thousands of lives in the United States.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Bitcoin?\n\nFor years, I have advocated for the Bitcoin community to stand firmly against the inherent conflict of interest that exists when Bitcoin-focused developers, custodians, exchanges and other businesses take investment money from companies in the legacy payment, finance and banking economies. New York Life, CME Group (NASDAQ: CME) and Mastercard (NASDAQ: MA) aren\u2019t trustworthy bedfellows with a distributed electronic cash system that seamlessly combines data and money, are they? Of course not! So, the fact that they pay the salaries (through Digital Currency Group) of the developers who issue soft fork changes to the Bitcoin Core repo should be a gigantic, glaring, blaring red flag that something has gone completely awry!\n\nThe wolves are all the way in the hen house!\n\nWe know for a fact that soft forks cannot be resisted. Despite campaigns touting that you can\u2019t \u201cchange the code,\u201d the fact is that the code changes constantly, and the way that it changes leaves a small blocker with two options:\n\n1: Upgrade to the latest version to be able to validate transactions\n\nOR\n\n2: \u201cResist\u201d the upgrade, and be unable to validate transactions.\n\nThere is NO OPTION to resist in any practical manner, which means there is no reason to run a node at all, and doing so makes a \u201cnode operator\u201d nothing more than Maggie Simpson.\n\nBut instead of joining me to defend BTC, BCH and then BSV against the onslaught of Silicon Valley and old world finance, small blockers dance on bitcoin\u2019s grave while calling folks like me a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d and focusing on non-news like the existence of the Lightning Sharks agency or Craig\u2019s nefarious plan to spend a ton of money, time and reputational capital to stand up for deeply unpopular ideas as some sort of \u201cscam.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tiresome, it\u2019s nonsense, and I can\u2019t wait until we move on to the era when today\u2019s \u201ccrypto\u201d influencers are laughed off of stages globally for being their unique mix of incompetence and malice for selling the bitcoin dream to the enemies!\n\nThankfully, there\u2019s still rocks to look under, documents to inspect and facts to be revealed about the history of Bitcoin, Satoshi, the quiet coups, and the deep-seeded corruption that only Bitcoin can solve.\n\nEventually, the free independent press will pick this up too, and we will all be better for it.\n\nWatch: Bitcoin needs more salespeople\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Steve Hanke, a professor of Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University, is the latest scholar to trash Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Has No Fundamental Value, Says Professor\n\nIn a tweet on March 26, Hanke said Bitcoin is not a currency but a speculative asset whose fundamental value is zero. He appeared to back fiat, including the Japanese Yen and the USD, two of the world\u2019s reserve currencies, as appropriate hedges in economic turmoil.\n\nBitcoin is not a currency. It's just a highly speculative asset with a fundamental value of zero. pic.twitter.com/leA4Fe9Ixz \u2014 Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) March 26, 2023\n\nConsidering the role of the USD in the world\u2019s market, the currency minted by the Federal Reserve has been historically used to hedge against economic crises. The USD remains as a store value, explaining the currency\u2019s spike in valuation whenever the equities market tank.\n\nHanke\u2019s comments come when Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been outperforming traditional assets, expanding amid the banking crisis in the United States.\n\nFollowing the bank run on Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the subsequent intervention by the United States government, where the Federal Reserve had to inject liquidity, averting a crisis, Bitcoin prices have been rallying. Last week, BTC peaked at around $28,800, the highest in over nine months.\n\nThe expansion of Bitcoin prices while banking stocks were under pressure, observers note, was enough to justify the digital gold\u2019s role as a store of value. Hanke is pessimistic about Bitcoin, dismissing its use as a hedge. Specifically, he mentions the coin\u2019s speculative nature, a trait also linked to the asset\u2019s volatility.\n\nIn another tweet, the economist lauded the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for getting serious about going after Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange. The regulator says Coinbase has violated a range of investor protection rules.\n\n1/ Today Coinbase received a Wells notice from the SEC focused on staking and asset listings. A Wells notice typically precedes an enforcement action. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 22, 2023\n\nThe Wells Notice would possibly be the beginning of a legal showdown between the SEC, that\u2019s been, in recent months, clamping down hard on crypto businesses, and Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the country.\n\nDr. Doom Celebrated The Failure Of Crypto-Friendly Banks\n\nHanke joins the likes of Nouriel Roubini, often known as \u201cDr. Doom\u201d, who has been very vocal about his disdain for crypto. Roubini is a New York University professor emeritus and a Bitcoin critic. The professor celebrated the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank of New York in mid-March, slamming them for getting involved in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a tweet, Roubini said all banks supporting cryptocurrencies would collapse and that it was good riddance. He added that there was no logic in protecting depositors of Signature Bank, an institution that \u201crecklessly decided to jump into the crappy crypto cesspool and bet the house on shitcoins biz.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Roubini said crypto is risky, and the entire industry will go extinct.\n\nFeature Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Meanwhile, the market faces a liquidity crisis triggered by the shutdown of Silvergate\u2019s SEN and Signature\u2019s Signet network in early March. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s happening in the market.\n\nBitcoin Liquidity at 10-Month Low\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s stellar performance this year, investors may still be wary due to its low market liquidity. An indicator tracking the ease of buying and selling Bitcoin has dropped, hitting a low not seen in the past ten months.\n\nEvaluating the buy and sell orders in the market maker\u2019s order books, with a 2% maximum deviation from the token price on either side, is crucial in calculating this metric.\n\nBesides, the drop in market liquidity can be traced to a lack of dollar-payment methods available to firms dealing in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nWith market observers on high alert for further repercussions or turmoil, the ebb in liquidity has happened as Silvergate Capital Corp. and Signature Bank, which had close ties to the crypto industry, collapsed in recent weeks. These financiers had provided banking services to many digital asset companies, and exchanges had used them for real-time transfers, among other things.\n\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as they await the fate of Bitcoin\n\nNonetheless, even though the market has proven resilient in the past, the current liquidity crisis poses a serious threat to its stability. It\u2019s unclear whether the current Bitcoin momentum will last or give in to the turmoil.\n\nMoreover, low liquidity in financial markets tends to result in high volatility, which can impact prices in both directions. It is because prices have reduced support both on the downside and the upside.\n\nThe post-FTX decline in volume, or the \u201cAlameda Gap,\u201d illuminates how crypto market liquidity vanished in the absence of one of the major digital asset market movers. Following the Silvergate and Signature banking crises, which cut off market makers from vital USD payment rails, that liquidity gap has not recovered and keeps falling to new lows.\n\nFortunately for investors, a surge in purchase demand brought on by the banking confidence crisis has driven the price up. However, the absence of support on the upswing also holds true on the downside, so we must be equally wary of an oversized move downward in the upcoming weeks.\n\nBinance Hit With $218 Million Outflow Amid CFTC Legal Action\n\nThere have been accounts of sizable capital outflows following the news of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) lawsuit against Binance, the leading CEX. Since the CFTC announced the legal action, there have allegedly been withdrawals of $218 million from the exchange.\n\nMoreover, users have expressed worry after the CFTC charged Binance with breaking U.S. trading and derivatives regulations.\n\nThe market frequently experiences token withdrawals, which can be a standard component of the ebb and flow of trading activity. However, the timing of these withdrawals is notable as it relates to the proceedings surrounding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s lawsuit and the legal steps taken against the CEX.\n\nRegarding inflows, Binance has noticed a rise in deposit activity in certain areas like Asia. It appears that some users are taking advantage of the market volatility by buying tokens at reduced prices while others are withdrawing their funds from the exchange.\n\nEthereum: Is It a Security or a Commodity?\n\nBinance was charged on March 27 by the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) for breaking federal laws. Notably, the governing authority asserted that Ethereum is also a commodity in its case.\n\nThis lawsuit occurred weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission closed down Kraken\u2019s crypto-staking service, wherein they classified ETH as a security.\n\nThe conflicting opinions on whether Ethereum belongs in the category of a security or a commodity are to blame for the industry\u2019s lack of regulatory clarification.\n\nThis incident is not the first; earlier this year, SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the CFTC Chair reaffirmed that ETH should be treated like a commodity.\n\nAccording to their definition, \u201csecurity\u201d is a financial commodity or instrument with a worth that can be purchased, sold, or traded. Stocks, investments, etc. are examples of the same. Contrarily, a \u201ccommodity\u201d is a tangible product exchanged on exchanges whose worth is based on supply and demand.\n\nSince staking is a necessary component of using Ethereum, it falls more into security than a commodity. On the other hand, Bitcoin, which has financial similarities to gold, is more akin to a commodity than a security.\n\nHowever, if Ethereum is deemed a \u201csecurity,\u201d it will affect the platforms that intend to list it. These platforms and exchanges must file with the SEC as a \u201csecurities\u201d broker-dealer or delist ETH to avoid trading securities illegally. As a result, it would affect both centralized trades and decentralized exchanges.\n\nFurthermore, this development could further shake the already dwindling trust in exchanges.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nOn March 27, users transferred their ETH to self-custody wallets or staked it, dropping the Ethereum volume on exchanges to just 10.3%. It is the lowest supply level since the cryptocurrency\u2019s inception in 2015.\n\nMoreover, the collapse of FTX has left ETH holders\u2019 trust in these exchanges unsettled, resulting in a decrease in the amount of ETH held by exchanges to below 12.5 million ETH ($25.4 billion).\n\nBattle for Stablecoin Dominance Heats Up\n\nAs the war for stablecoin shares rages on, which stablecoin will prevail, USDT with a 44.60% market capitalization or USDC with a 43.78%?\n\nThe fall of the USDC stablecoin is one of the repercussions of the banking crisis in the United States, which is at its height right now. Its market capitalization declined by 7.06%, while the USDT stablecoin grew by 6.2%.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nBesides, the \u201cold money\u201d USDT currently has a greater chance of winning the battle for the leading global stablecoin. We should support market rivalry in general, but a secure stablecoin is what we need.\n\nIn Web3, stablecoins are digital assets pegged to the value of fiat money or other commodities like gold or oil. Compared to other cryptos, which are subject to substantial market price changes, stablecoins are more stable.\n\nThe two stablecoins currently most in demand are USDC and USDT. Both stablecoins enjoy a sizable portion of the cryptocurrency market valuation, indicating strong investor demand.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nCurrently, USDT has a slight edge over USDC because it is not losing market capitalization share. However, there are benefits to USDC as well, such as increased operational transparency and frequent financial statement audits.\n\nIn any case, the rivalry between these two stablecoins is advantageous for the cryptocurrency market as it encourages product improvement and higher user security standards among developers.\n\nThe stablecoin race may thus go on for a very long time, but eventually, the winner will be the one who offers the finest product tailored to the market\u2019s needs.\n\nWhales Exiting?\n\nAnalysis of Bitcoin addresses by their holdings reveals a notable trend: smaller investors are increasingly accumulating while the number of more prominent investors, or \u201cwhales,\u201d is declining. This trend appears to have accelerated following the recent collapse of FTX, which has seen a sharp drop in the number of whales holding over 1,000 BTC.\n\nMoreover, the decline in whale numbers suggests that these investors seek to diversify their holdings across multiple custodians and addresses or are considering exiting the Bitcoin market altogether.\n\nSource: Galaxy Research\n\nIn contrast, smaller investors with 10 BTC or fewer holdings have consistently accumulated approximately 30,000 BTC per month, exceeding the network\u2019s issuance of around 900 BTC/day.\n\nThis data suggests that smaller investors are becoming a significant force in the Bitcoin market, accumulating a growing share of the crypto and potentially exerting a more substantial influence on its price trajectory.\n\nTradFi Worries Drive $160m Inflows to Crypto\n\nFor the first time since July 2022, investments in digital asset assets saw inflows totaling US$160 million. After US$408 million in withdrawals over the previous six weeks, this is a dramatic reversal. Nevertheless, compared to the overall crypto market, the inflows arrived relatively late; this might be because investors are growing more concerned about the stability of the traditional financial sector.\n\n\n\nSource: CoinShares\n\nMoreover, the fact that the deposits came from numerous nations suggests a general upsurge in the positive outlook for the asset class. The most significant outflows, totaling US$69 million, US$58 million, and US$26 million, respectively, were from the U.S., Germany, and Canada.\n\nMoney is pouring into money market funds as investors worry about the security of the financial system and as tighter monetary policies are causing liquidity woes for banks in the United States and Europe. Due to their high liquidity and low risk, money market funds are popular among investors during economic instability. These funds are currently offering some of the best returns in years due to the consistent interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve to combat inflation.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Realized Price and Market Dynamics\n\nRealized Price represents the average cost base of all bitcoins in circulation. Its calculation involves dividing the worth of all bitcoins at the purchase price by the total number of bitcoins in circulation. The concept of Realized Price is founded on the notion that each UTXO is valued at the price it was last moved between wallets.\n\nDuring bull markets, the Realized Price of Bitcoin usually rises because buyers who purchase tokens at greater prices are more prevalent. The average price per coin increases in a parabolic fashion until Bitcoin reaches all-time highs. As soon as this occurs, the Realized Price usually forms a flat plateau.\n\nDuring bear markets, the Realized Price may marginally fall. For instance, the Realized Price declined from its December 2021 value of $24,500 to lower levels (gradually from levels around $24,500 to levels below $20,000) during the most recent bear market in January 2023.\n\nThe cause for this decline is that long-term holders acquire Bitcoin at reduced rates, which lowers the Realized Price (LTH realized price). Besides, the Realized Price of Bitcoin reached its lowest point of the bear market during the recent 25% drop in Bitcoin\u2019s market price, which occurred this month and brought its value to $19,800.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nMoreover, the high demand pressure on Bitcoin led to massive accumulation as its price dipped below $20,000, which caused the Realized Price to reach $19,700, indicating a turning point.\n\nAn inflection point in the Realized Price usually marks the shift from a bear market to a bull market. Due to rising demand, there is a good chance that the Realized Price of Bitcoin will surpass the $20,000 mark and return to its ATH values.\n\nBitcoin the New Safe Haven?\n\nIn the past few months, the correlation between Bitcoin and equities has decreased after remaining at an elevated level for 18 months. Notably, since the onset of the banking crisis, Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to equities has dropped, while its correlation to gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, has significantly increased. This trend suggests that, at least in recent times, Bitcoin has been behaving more like a safe-haven asset than a high-risk asset.\n\nSource: Galaxy Research\n\nSource: Galaxy Research\n\nWith the current crisis testing the limitations of the fractional reserve banking system, Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental characteristics can offer a safe haven for investors if custody or self-custody is appropriately managed. These correlation data demonstrate that Bitcoin has unique properties that can differentiate it as a safe port in a storm.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "title": "Six Million Bitcoins Now Lost Forever? Why This Matters - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Over the years, millions of Bitcoin have been lost forever due to people forgetting or losing their keys, or possibly passing away without passing on their keys. With each passing year, this number grows and more BTC is lost. Now, this number is estimated to have crossed 6 million, which is quite bullish for the digital asset.\n\nSix Million BTC Are Out Of Circulation Forever\n\nIn a tweet, a manager at Cane Island Alternative Advisors, an investment advisory firm, revealed that the number of lost Bitcoins has crossed 6 million. Timothy Peterson shared this over the weekend where he explained that of the 19.3 million BTC that have been mined so far, there are only 13.3 million currently available. Going by Peterson\u2019s numbers, over 31% of the current Bitcoin circulation supply is lost forever.\n\nI estimate that, as of this week, 6 million of the 19.3 million #bitcoin mined have been irretrievably lost. (See related research at https://t.co/ULso76SXjD ) This means 13.3 million remain with only 1.7 million left to be mined over the next 100+ years. In that time, it's\u2026 pic.twitter.com/WpiSNT9TSF \u2014 Timothy Peterson, CFA CAIA (@nsquaredcrypto) March 25, 2023\n\nThe investment manager further went on to state that another one million coins are expected to be lost by the time the remaining 1.7 million BTC are mined, which would take over 100 years with a halving happening every four years. Thus, \u201cThe 13 million circulating now is probably all you will have access to in your lifetime,\u201d Peterson concludes.\n\nPeterson shared a link to a 2020 study from Cane Island Alternative Advisors which showed at the time that about 4 million BTC were lost forever, with the claims that there will never be more than 14 million BTC in circulation. However, the investment manager did not back his most recent claims with data.\n\nLost Bitcoin Good For Price?\n\nBitcoin already has a limited supply, which has been a boon for its value, but with millions of coins being lost as well, it reduces the already limited supply. If Peterson is correct and there will only be 14 million BTC in existence even when all 21 million are mined, then the value of Bitcoin could skyrocket beyond expectations.\n\nBTC price trending below $28,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBTC has no official burn, but other projects such as Shiba Inu have taken the burning approach to reduce the supply of the token and increase its value in the process. This works basically the same way for any asset, if supply remains lower than demand, then the value of that asset will continue to rise.\n\nCane Island Alternative Advisors acknowledges in its 2020 research note that the demand for BTC has been on the rise. \u201cBy all accounts, bitcoin demand has increased over time. Every metric \u2013 active addresses, transaction counts, hash rates, etc. has shown increased demand for bitcoin. Since price has also increased over that time, we can conclude that the increase in demand has outpaced the increase in supply.\u201d\n\nAs Bitcoin adoption is expected to accelerate over the next few years and more BTC are lost, BTC at six figures become an even more likely reality.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from The Enlightened Mindset, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Difference between Bitcoin software, network, and protocol - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Something that people don\u2019t normally consider: when someone says \u201cBSV\u201d or \u201cBTC\u201d what is it that you think of? Is it the coin which is traded on an exchange? Is it the platform, upon which people develop blockchain applications? Is it the peer-to-peer network of nodes? Or is it the software that runs said nodes?\n\nWell if you are not sure, then rest-assured you are probably part of the vast majority. It is the hope of this article to clear some of this up, as the \u2018crypto\u2019 industry is rife with many misunderstandings and misdirections, of which this is one of the most common. After we have cleared up the differences between these, I wish to turn to the issue of chain splits (sometimes called \u2018forks\u2019), which may occur when the nodes of the network do not come to majority consensus on what the ledger state should be. Why is this relevant? Well, as we all know, chain splits are very disruptive to blockchains, leading to splitting of the developer community, and battles over which side gets to keep the standing token ticker symbol. Why is understanding chain splits important? Well, because as blockchains in general become integrated into the common law of society, we need to arm ourselves with the knowledge on how the implementation of law will affect the operations of blockchains.\n\nUp until this point, the narrative that has been pandered is that blockchains, due to their decentralized nature, live completely supra-legal, and outside of the reach and understanding of common laws. This cannot be further from the truth, as given enough time, laws has a way of catching up with whatever technology or society can invent. There were no airline safety laws before the time of the Wright brothers, nor were there laws against using radioactive radium in toothpaste at the turn of the century, but would it have been reasonable for scientists to argue that laws surrounding the harm done by invisible forces such as radiation poisoning could never be devised? Well by that same reasoning crypto proponents have been claiming for years that laws could never be enforced against a decentralized network such as those employed by blockchains\u2026 and people to this day still believe it. And this is relevant and topical considering the upcoming clash between the \u2018common wisdom\u2019 of crypto and the law in the cases surrounding Craig Wright\u2019s claim for his stolen bitcoins. But first, let\u2019s clear up some terminology.\n\nWhat is BSV, BTC?\n\nBSV is a ticker symbol that represents a protocol, and the Bitcoin SV node is simply software for a node which is compatible with that protocol. Similarly BTC is a protocol, and BTC-Core is node software that adheres to the BTC protocol. Of the protocols, BSV is the closest to the original Bitcoin protocol as described in the original Bitcoin white paper, as it does not include any of the changes that were pushed into the BTC or BCH protocols in order to support different higher layer protocols and platforms1 such as Lightning Network. The BSV protocol function by function is closest to what Bitcoin was in 2009. With that understanding, Bitcoin SV is just what happens to be the most prevalent node software available presently, but it is by no means the only one. In fact, there are several other node softwares available for those who do not wish to use the official version, including ones implemented in Go, Rust, and an upcoming one called Teranode, which promises to be able to process terabyte sized blocks. No matter the node software you run, however, as long as it adheres to the open protocol of BSV, BTC, or BCH, your node will remain in sync or \u2018in consensus\u2019 with other nodes that run on that protocol.\n\nSeen in this light, chain splits are just a simple matter of some servers falling out of consensus with each other, and not being able to follow the chain. If they fail to upgrade their software to the version that the miners (henceforth referred to as \u2018block producers\u2019) are running, then they simply never receive any new blocks, and to them, the blockchain will have essentially stopped. They may see plenty of transactions and traffic on their network, but blocks will simply never come. Listening-only nodes have no ability to cause a chain or ledger to split. They have no power whatsoever, as they are listen-only.\n\nA chain split is when the block producing nodes don\u2019t all agree on the rules. When a significant proportion of the producing nodes are running incompatible software, with incompatible protocol rulesets, then a potential for chain split exists. This is what happened twice in the past\u2014first, when BTC split away from Bitcoin with the introduction of the \u2018SegWit\u2019 change, and then later, when BCH introduced a change to enable tokens which the majority did not accept. In each of these past splits, the protocol which remained the closest to the original ruleset had to change the ticker symbol of their token, due to the fact that the exchanges where tokens were traded were confused over which of the token ledgers would use the existing ticker symbol, and which would be given a new one. However, generally speaking a chain split is unlikely (because it is costly2) to result when a majority of the block producers are in agreement with which version of the node software they will run, and therefore which ruleset they will support.\n\nFrom the perspective software, BSV, BTC, and BCH node software is simply a set of protocol rules to follow, and different block producers running different software will result in seeing different versions of the ledger. The effect of this is that with every ledger split, a new token is created3 or \u201cairdropped.\u201d This is how the current situation came to be, with 3 major tokens all claiming to be Bitcoin. But it is only upon the examination of the protocol and ruleset that they enforce that one can start to form an opinion of which is the closest match to what \u2018bitcoin\u2019 truly is. Contrary to popular belief, it is not necessarily the ledger token that the exchanges have decided to award the legacy ticker symbol to. The exchanges, after all, do not get to decide what a product is.\n\nTherefore, if \u2018bitcoin\u2019 is just a protocol, and not the network, or a coin, then the BSV node is just the version of software that you run, and what software you run determines what version of the ledger you see. What this means is when the time comes for law enforcement to effect the freezing of coins, whether it be to stop the proceeds of criminal activity or to recover lost funds, all that is required is for a majority of block producing nodes to be running the version of software that will honor the confiscation of frozen coins. And given that any sort of confiscation transaction cannot be created unless a majority of block producers agree on the status of the coins in question, there will be nary a chance for a chain split. The current method for effecting the freezing and re-issuance of coins by court order while implemented only in the BSV node software, was written to be compatible with BTC node software, so it is conceivable that block producers could contract developers to patch the BTC node software with the necessary changes in order to comply with the asset recovery process. Whether or not authorities will be able to compel a majority of the block producers to upgrade their software, will be a different matter, and an issue that will be played out in the real world, and not on the blockchain. But that, is for the lawyers to worry about. Not the technologists, or the users.\n\nJerry Chan\n\nWallStreetTechnologist\n\n***\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Arguably because they were tooted as a solution to the false \u2018scaling problem\u2019 of bitcoin, which BSV solved simply by reverting to the original bitcoin rules.\n\n[2] in order to support a chain split, the minority side must constantly burn cash in producing blocks which may have no future value, perpetually.\n\n[3] although which is the new token and which is the old token is indeterminate and up for endless pointless debate.\n\nWatch: Here\u2019s how Bitcoin works as a base layer for other blockchains\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

The rally was partly fueled by a weaker dollar as well as a rise in both liquidity and volatility seems to have run out of steam.\n\nAs the fallout from the banking turmoil continued to roil markets BTCUSD reached a 9-month high as market participants could have viewed bitcoin and cryptocurrency as an alternative to cash storage. This would come as somewhat of a surprise given last year's public failure of FTX as well as the ongoing scrutiny of the crypto industry, particularly in the US. Hard wallet crypto storage does however have a sense of appeal and mitigates such risks in these somewhat uncertain times and crypto prices seem to have benefitted.\n\nTrade Smarter - Sign up for the DailyFX Newsletter Receive timely and compelling market commentary from the DailyFX team Subscribe to Newsletter\n\nJPMorgan bank said the US banking crisis has opened up opportunities to increase market share for those exchanges offering banking services. Whether adoption will be smooth and swift though remains to be seen given some of the public scandals in 2022 and increased regulatory scrutiny. Nasdaq has also announced its plans to launch cryptocurrency storage services by the end of Q2 2023. Whether these developments will support crypto and bitcoin prices in the months to come remains up for debate.\n\nBreaking news just a while ago regarding Binance the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao were sued by the US CFTC for allegedly breaking trading and derivative rules. This could further weigh on prices as more information is released on the matter supporting the narrative of lower prices in BTCUSD.\n\nTECHNICAL OUTLOOK\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Bitcoin has been in a state of consolidation for the best part of 10 days since breaking above the $28000 mark. On the 4H chart below we can see the triangle pattern in play with a break and candle close below the triangle likely opening up a retest of the 100-day and 200-day MAs resting at $26000 and $24400 respectively. Given that we are currently breaking out with a bit of momentum a retest of the triangle breakout may be the smarter play and provide a better risk-to-reward opportunity for potential shorts.\n\nChanges in risk sentiment may play a role on any potential move and may be something to keep an eye on. The Banking sector turmoil remains far from over while geopolitical risks have reared their head over the weekend and could propel BTCUSD higher if they do escalate.\n\nBTC/USD Four-Hour Chart \u2013 March 27, 2023\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda The Fundamentals of Breakout Trading Get My Guide\n\nWritten by: Zain Vawda, Market Writer for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow Zain on Twitter: @zvawda"

        "content": "Are you ready to explore the world of Bitcoin wallets and learn how to maximize their potential? Dive into our comprehensive guide that meticulously examines Electrum SV, RockWallet, and HandCash, three prominent wallets in the Bitcoin SV (BSV) ecosystem. We\u2019ll walk you through their unique features, capabilities, and limitations, empowering you to make informed decisions and leverage each wallet to suit your needs. Discover how using these wallets in tandem can elevate your Bitcoin experience and boost your Bitcoin journey.\n\nIn a previous article, I shared a simple way to create a Bitcoin address1, allowing you to receive BSVs (not BTC) in no time. As long as you keep your private key safe, your Bitcoins are secure in the blockchain.\n\nThis method is perfect for those who want to quickly start earning BSVs without diving deep into the technical side of Bitcoin. If your goal is to monetize your website, sell digital products (like ebooks, music, or software), or offer your services and expertise worldwide, it\u2019s essential to focus on your business rather than the intricacies of Bitcoin. However, after some time and effort spent making sales, you\u2019ll eventually accumulate a significant amount of Bitcoins (BSVs) in your address. So, how do you use, spend, or transfer your Bitcoins?\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s time to expand your Bitcoin knowledge by exploring \u2018warm\u2019 or \u2018hot\u2019 wallets. These wallets are connected to the internet, making it easy to send Bitcoins. In contrast, a Bitcoin address alone is like a \u2018cold\u2019 wallet\u2014not connected to the internet. I\u2019ve tested three top BSV wallets\u2014Electrum SV, RockWallet, and HandCash\u2014and documented my findings in a video2. In this article, I\u2019ll summarize what I discovered and suggest when and how to use each wallet.\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nElectrum SV (Desktop version on Windows)\n\nElectrum SV is a popular wallet within the BSV community, providing users with a safe and flexible platform to manage their digital assets.\n\nOne standout feature is the ability to transform cold wallets into warm ones. By using your Bitcoin address\u2019s private key, Electrum SV activates your cold wallet and imports its transaction history. It can also import wallets from other sources that use seed words. Once you\u2019ve imported or activated your cold wallet, you\u2019re ready to send Bitcoins to anyone worldwide.\n\nAdditionally, Electrum SV supports multi-signature wallets, an essential tool for businesses and individuals aiming to enhance their security. Multi-signature wallets protect your Bitcoins by only allowing transactions when a specific number of authorized signatories approve it. This feature has practical applications, like authorizing Bitcoin transfers only after a certain process is complete. For instance, a set amount of Bitcoins is sent after the seller, delivery company, and customer have all signed off on various transaction stages.\n\nWhile Electrum SV meets most needs, it lacks the ability to buy BSVs directly. That\u2019s why I\u2019d like to introduce RockWallet, which allows you to purchase BSVs with a credit card.\n\nRockWallet (Android version)\n\nRockWallet allows you to purchase BSVs using a credit card, making it a convenient option. It also offers a \u2018sweep\u2019 feature, enabling you to transfer the entire balance of your Bitcoin address (cold storage/paper wallet) to RockWallet\u2019s Bitcoin address using the private key of your cold storage wallet. You can easily send, spend, or transfer your Bitcoins from there.\n\nRockWallet employs seed words to generate various Bitcoin addresses (public and private key pairs) for transactions, enhancing security and privacy. A notable feature is its ability to export transaction history to CSV files, which include essential details like source and destination Bitcoin addresses, amounts sent or received, transaction dates, and transaction IDs searchable via a Bitcoin Explorer. It also displays the prevailing exchange rate during each transaction, converting amounts to fiat currency values. This functionality is crucial for businesses, as they can export transaction histories to CSVs and import them into spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets for accounting or bookkeeping purposes.\n\nWhile RockWallet is excellent for personal and business use, let\u2019s also explore HandCash, another fantastic wallet option.\n\nHandCash (Android version)\n\nHandCash is an impressive wallet that integrates seamlessly with various BSV apps and websites, providing users with a convenient and versatile platform for managing, spending, and earning Bitcoins as they use these apps and websites. For example, you can earn by selling your music or podcasts every time someone listens to your works (by using apps like Rare Generation, StreamableFM, and Real World Podcasts).\n\nYou can earn when you promote webpages (by using TonicPow). There is a list of games you can play too. They are all integrated into your HandCash wallet, so you can pay or earn automatically while playing. HandCash and the different apps and websites that utilize its power show off what is possible with BSV.\n\nFurther, HandCash provides APIs and SDKs so developers and programmers can easily integrate and monetize their apps, websites, and software with Bitcoin. So if you can code, consider looking into HandCash to plug into the power of BSV.\n\nI should mention that based on my tests on February 26, I could not buy BSV with HandCash with a credit card due to a temporary issue with their credit card partner. I am confident and hopeful that they will resolve this soon. In the meantime, you can easily transfer BSVs to your HandCash wallet from any wallet, including RockWallet and Electrum SV.\n\nNo need to choose\u2014use multiple wallets\n\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that you don\u2019t have to pick just one wallet among Electrum SV, RockWallet, and HandCash. Knowing their capabilities, limitations, and features allows you to choose the right wallet for each transaction and situation. Feel free to use any or all of these wallets, as transferring funds between them is a breeze and can be done quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, the world of BSV wallets offers various options to cater to your unique personal or business-related needs. Electrum SV, RockWallet, and HandCash each bring strengths and features, ensuring you have the right tools for every transaction.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to limit yourself to just one wallet; explore and utilize them all based on your requirements. Embrace the power and convenience of these digital wallets to enhance your Bitcoin experience. Give them a try and unlock the true potential of BSV to monetize your passions and improve your business and your everyday life.\n\nAbout the author\n\nMarquez Comelab, the founder of BSVSearch.com, is a firm believer in the potential of BSV to offer professionals, creatives, and small businesses a straightforward and cost-effective means of monetizing their products and services.

        "title": "Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation: What Happens when Issuers are Unknown? - Bird & Bird",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe European Parliament is set to approve the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCAR) in April, thereby launching the European framework for crypto-assets. The final compromise text of MiCAR was published on 5 October 2022. For a detailed analysis of the requirements introduced by the regulation and their implications, please consult our comprehensive \u201cRoad to MiCAR\u201d guide.\n\nThe regulation lays down rules for the issuance of different types of crypto-assets and for services exercised by different crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). However, the fact that MiCAR will regulate the issuance of crypto-assets, creates a need to ensure regulatory clarity for those crypto-assets, which do not have an identifiable issuer. These include the native assets of some of the largest decentralised blockchain protocols, such as Bitcoin.\n\nBelow we discuss the potential regulatory implications for CASPs who intend to offer services related to these assets.\n\nClassification of crypto-assets\n\nMiCAR defines a crypto-asset as a \u201cdigital representation of value or rights, which may be transferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger or similar technology\u201d (Art. 3(1)(2), MiCAR compromise text). Beyond the general definition, MiCAR also creates three sub-categories of crypto-assets, split into three groups, namely: Asset Referenced Tokens (ARTs), which are tokens the value of which is pegged to a basket of other assets, e-money tokens (EMTs), the value of which is pegged to a single fiat currency and a catch-all category for crypto-assets other than ARTs and EMTs. The latter category includes utility tokens, defined separately as a token \u201cwhich is intended to provide digital access to a good or service, available on DLT, and is only accepted by the issuer of that token\u201d (Art. 3(1)(5), MiCAR compromise text).\n\nBased on the above categories, it can be determined that assets without an identifiable issuer such as Bitcoin and the native assets of other decentralised blockchain protocols will fall into the third, catch-all group. This raises several questions regarding liability for the regulatory requirements applicable to these assets under MiCAR, as they often have no identifiable issuer or the issuers (often a non-associated team of core developers) do not exercise economic control over the asset, and do not reap profits from their activity, which amounts to maintenance and development of the underlying blockchain infrastructure.\n\nTo address this issue, Recital 12a was added to the MiCAR compromise text stating that: \u201cWhere crypto-asset services as defined in this Regulation are provided in a fully decentralised manner, without any intermediary, they do not fall within the scope of this Regulation. This Regulation covers the rights and obligations applicable to issuers, offerors and persons seeking admission to trading of crypto-assets and to crypto-asset service providers. Where crypto-assets have no identifiable issuer, they do not fall within Title II, III or IV of this Regulation. Crypto-asset service providers providing services to such crypto-assets are, however, fully covered by this Regulation.\u201d\n\nNormally, under MiCAR, offerors of crypto-assets other than ARTs and EMTs are required to publish a white paper with respect to the issued token, before that token is offered to the public. The white paper must be drafted by a legal entity, notified to competent authorities and must include, amongst other things, information on the offeror and the issuer (if different from offeror), the underlying project, its risks, rights and obligations attached to the asset, the underlying technology and its environmental impacts (Art.5, MiCAR compromise text). Smaller offerings may be exempted from the obligation to publish a white paper (Art. 4(2)(b), MiCAR compromise text).\n\nRecital 12a clarifies that these obligations do not/cannot apply to crypto-assets without an identifiable issuer. However, platform operators providing services in relation to these assets must comply with all requirements laid down with respect to the list of crypto-asset services included in MiCAR.\n\nCrypto Asset Services Under MiCA and obligations of trading platform operators\n\nArt. 3(1)(9) of the MiCAR compromise text provides a list of crypto-asset services regulated by the text. These include:\n\ncustody and administration\n\nthe operation of trading platforms\n\nthe exchange of crypto-assets for funds (on-ramps/off-ramps)\n\nthe exchange of crypto-assets for crypto-assets\n\nthe execution of crypto-asset orders for third parties\n\nplacing crypto-assets\n\ntransfer, reception and transmission of crypto-assets\n\nproviding advice and portfolio management with respect to crypto assets\n\nAs Bitcoin is the largest crypto-asset by market capitalisation (USD value of total floating supply of Bitcoin), most providers of the above crypto services will have exposure and will offer services linked to Bitcoin.\n\nFrom the above list, regulatory clarity is the most needed for operators of trading platforms who seek to admit crypto-assets without an identifiable issuer on their exchanges. Art. 4a of the MiCAR compromise text states that anyone asking for admission of a crypto-asset, other than an ART or an EMT, must have \u201cdrafted a crypto-asset white paper in respect of those crypto-assets in accordance with Article 5\u201d. Furthermore, under Art. 123(1a)(b) of the MiCAR compromise text, it is the responsibility of operators of trading platforms to publish a white paper for crypto-assets, other than ARTs and EMTs, which were admitted to trading on a trading platform before the entry into force of MiCAR.\n\nIn the case of crypto-assets without an identifiable issuer there is no consensus whether platform operators are the ones offering the crypto-asset to the public, or if there is simply no offeror. In either case, platform operators will fall under the Article 4a obligation to draft a white paper if they want to admit the given crypto-asset without an identifiable issuer to trading on their platform. Otherwise, this responsibility could potentially fall on the shoulders of a single holder of Bitcoin, which could not have been the intention of the legislators behind MiCAR.\n\nIt will therefore be considered the responsibility of the trading platform operator to draft, notify, and publish a white paper, either as offeror of the crypto-asset, or as the person seeking its admission to trading. This poses an interesting legal and technical challenge, as so far, we can only speculate what form a potential MiCAR approved white paper for Bitcoin may look like. It is probable that exchange operators will rely on more or less standardised templates across the sector.\n\nLiability\n\na. Under MiCAR:\n\nArt. 14 of the MiCAR compromise text clarifies that holders of crypto-assets can claim damages from the entity that was responsible for issuing the white paper, in case there was an infringement of the requirements established by Art. 5. Actors operating a trading platform who want to list a crypto-asset without an identifiable issuer will, therefore, be required to comply with the white paper requirement contained in Article 4a and could be held liable in disputes arising from those white papers with consumers who hold those assets on the given trading platform.\n\nb. Liability for on-chain activities and decentralised finance (DeFi):\n\ni. To explore another interesting aspect of the regulatory treatment of crypto-assets without an identifiable issuer, we must look at the treatment of DeFi from a regulatory perspective. For the moment, DeFi does not fall under the regulatory umbrella of MiCAR. This is demonstrated by the exemptions afforded to on-chain staking and mining activities and non-custodial digital wallets.\n\nWhen talking about DeFi, it needs to be clear that regulators might qualify this term differently from the market. Depending on the control and intervention powers of the developers or others, there might be no real DeFi (but only so called \u201cdecentralization theatre\u201d).\n\nAccording to Recital 59 of the MiCAR compromise text, hardware and software providers of non-custodial wallets will not fall under the scope of the Regulation and according to Art. 4(2)(b) of the MiCAR compromise text, Title II shall not apply to the crypto-assets that are automatically created as a reward for the maintenance of the DLT or the validation of transactions (i.e. staking and mining activities).\n\nWithin 48 months after the application of MiCAR, the European Commission will complete an assessment of the development of DeFi in the crypto-asset markets and of the adequate regulatory treatment of decentralised crypto-asset systems. The report will assess the adequate regulatory treatment of decentralised crypto-asset systems without an issuer or crypto-asset service provider.\n\nii. In this regard, liability for on-chain activities on permissionless blockchains is a potentially decisive regulatory debate. Bird & Bird has advised on Tulip Trading Ltd v Bitcoin Association for BSV and others, a case that could represent a turning point in determining whether fiduciary/tortious duties are owed to users of the Bitcoin blockchain by the developers of the underlying software infrastructure.\n\nTulip Trading Ltd. sustained a loss of over USD 4.5 billion when the private keys to the fund\u2019s digital wallet were stolen. The fund in turn sued the core developers of the Bitcoin blockchain, who are split into different associations and networks of developers, for breach of a fiduciary duty owned to the users of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, the High Court of England and Wales in its summary judgment ruled that it is not realistic for Tulip Trading ltd. to claim that the developers owe a fiduciary duty to all users of the Bitcoin blockchain, as the users are a group which is by definition an \u201canonymous and fluctuating class with whom the defendants have no direct communication, and certainly no contractual relationship\u201d and the developers themselves are a \u201cfluctuating body of individuals. As a general proposition it cannot realistically be argued that they owe continuing obligations to, for example, remain as developers and make future updates whenever it might be in the interests of users to do so.\u201d\n\nTulip Trading Ltd. has appealed the decision and the appeal has been upheld, with the Court of Appeal stating that the facts of the case merit more extensive treatment than the summary judgment. Nonetheless, the court stated that for Tulip\u2019s case to succeed \u201ca significant development of the common law on fiduciary duties\" would be needed.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile MiCAR provides some insight on the obligations regarding crypto-assets without an identifiable issuer, in the long-run, strong industry standards for white papers will have to be developed, and the question of liability for on-chain activities will have to be examined by the European Commission taking into account international developments such as the outcome of the Tulip Trading Ltd. case.\n\nRegarding the regulatory timeline, MiCA enters into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal (OJ) of the EU, and it will apply from 18 months after the date of entry into force. Title III (on ARTs) and Title IV (on EMTs) will apply from 12 months after MiCA's entry into force.\n\nIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE OUR REGULAR PAYMENTS ALERTS IN YOUR INBOX, CLICK HERE\n\nIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO READ BIRD & BIRD\u2019S PREVIOUS ALERTS, PLEASE CHECK OUT OUR PAYMENTS IN FOCUS WEBPAGE HERE"

        "title": "Crypto News: Bitcoin and Ethereum push resistance levels; New Crypto Dogetti Aims for Meme Coin Throne. - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The crypto world is showing mixed reactions to the Fed\u2019s rate hike. While most currencies have taken a hit, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have climbed back from slumps and are pushing ahead. New crypto Dogetti (DETI) is attracting investor attention with its unique features and focus on DeFi ecosystems.\n\nEthereum is pushing the crucial $1800 resistance level.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is pushing the $1800 resistance level, and there is optimism in the market that if ETH manages to break past the resistance mark, it will reach the $2000 mark soon. The token\u2019s price has risen by almost 2% in the past 24 hours. Various factors contribute to Ethereum testing resistance levels, the foremost reason being ETH\u2019s transition into a Proof-of-Stake coin. Ethereum\u2019s growth as a favoured platform for DeFi applications is another factor adding to the rally in ETH prices.\n\nLong-term prospects of ETH are bright as the popularity of DeFi applications rises. Also, the volatility in the banking sector can also add growth to Ethereum, with the view that it is a more stable option than the former. Short-term volatility aside, the long-term investment credentials of Ethereum remain strong.\n\nBitcoin moves past rate hike blues.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) looks to cement its status as a safe haven investment option as the traditional financial system stares at banking failures. News of bank collapses and the general bad health of banks have contributed to a rally in Bitcoin prices. But the Fed\u2019s rate hikes have put the rally on hold, and Bitcoin prices took a beating yesterday. But BTC prices have shown resilience and have climbed back to the $28k levels today.\n\nThe latest price rally of Bitcoin is a testament that it has shrugged off stress from the Fed\u2019s latest round of rate hikes. In the background of the banking crisis, the premier crypto is resembling safer asset classes like gold and is displaying upward momentum. Investors decision to back Bitcoin may lie in its decentralised architecture with no single power centre. This feature differentiates it from fiat currencies, with powerful central banks controlling them. The growing popularity of decentralised finance will strengthen the case for favouring Bitcoin. Thus, Bitcoin could see a resurgence as the banking crisis unfolds. Nevertheless, its long-term prospects look strong on the back of the rise of DeFi.\n\nDogetti Eyes Top Doge Spot\n\nDogetti (DETI) is the newest entrant to the crypto world, and its stated goal is to be the top dog of the meme coin space. Dogetti is a community focussed token that plans to create generational wealth for its community. The token is themed around a DOGE mafia and calls itself the Dogetti family. The token is unique with its focus on decentralisation and community ownership. The Dogetti family\u2019s plans to create generational wealth for its members hinge on its plans to develop a comprehensive ecosystem that has NFTs and DeFi projects playing a central role.\n\nDogetti stands apart from its peers with its flagship feature, the buy-back protocol. The buy-back protocol allows community members to earn a 2% reflection on all transactions. The protocol would allow the members of the Dogetti family to have a steady stream of income.\n\nNFTs play a crucial role in Dogetti\u2019s plans for community engagement. The network would allow holders to have their versions of virtual pet Dogetti. NFTs on the network will give holders access to events and content. Another great feature of the Dogetti family is the DogettiDAO which will make decision-making on the network democratic and decentralised. Dogetti NFTs and DogettiDAO will put community members at the centre of the Dogetti project.\n\nDETI is based on the Ethereum blockchain and has a total supply of 100 billion tokens. Of the 100 billion liquidity, 75 billion are available on presale. The network also has plans for charity for which it will raise funds from taxes on its network.\n\nTo know more about Dogetti (DETI):\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "SINGAPORE - A face-to-face transaction to sell $320,000 worth of Bitcoin went awry when a quarrel broke out over who was entitled to the cash after the buyer denied having received the cryptocurrency, despite the Bitcoin network confirming the transfer.\n\nMr Christofle Rio, who had transferred 12.14 bitcoins to a digital wallet, eventually left the Tanjong Pagar apartment without the cash and bereft of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHe then sued Mr Malcolm Tan Chun Chuen, the man who transacted with him, for breach of contract for failing to pay the agreed price.\n\nBut Mr Tan argued that his company, Qrypt Technologies, was merely a middleman that facilitated the sale of Bitcoin from Mr Rio\u2019s company, GCXpress Commerce (GCX), to the actual buyers.\n\nHe contended that he cannot be liable, nor does Mr Rio have the legal standing to sue, simply because the agreement was not between them as individuals, but between their respective companies.\n\nMr Rio\u2019s lawsuit was dismissed last Wednesday, after the High Court found that both men were not the proper parties to the contract as they were acting on behalf of their respective companies, and not in their personal capacities.\n\nMr Rio set up GCX in 2019 as a cryptocurrencies trading business, while Mr Tan, a disbarred lawyer, was the managing director of Qrypt, a digital assets and blockchain company.\n\nAccording to Mr Tan, he was contacted on Dec 1, 2020 via messaging app Telegram by someone identified as \u201cKenneth\u201d, who asked to buy more than $300,000 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nMr Tan then contacted Mr Rio, who said he had $320,000 worth of Bitcoin to sell. They arranged to conduct the transaction at Mr Tan\u2019s office at 18 Spottiswoode Park Road that afternoon.\n\nMr Tan then informed Kenneth about the meeting. Kenneth said he would be present at the office with his staff, and emphasised that all communication should be done via Telegram.\n\nAt 4.10pm, three men, who identified themselves as Kenneth, Eric Foo and Chua Hong You, arrived at Mr Tan\u2019s office. Mr Foo took cash out of a bag and placed it on a table in the room.\n\nMr Tan asked Kenneth for his identity card to allow Qrypt\u2019s compliance manager to complete the checks to comply with Monetary Authority of Singapore regulations.\n\nKenneth declined and asked Mr Chua to provide his identity card instead. Mr Chua was cleared to proceed with the transaction.\n\nSome confusion was caused when a second buyer showed up, also carrying $320,000 in cash. The buyers had apparently arranged for him to wait downstairs. He was told to leave the premises."

The machines are connected to crypto payment services Alchemy Pay and Binance Pay.\n\nAlong with Binance Pay and Alchemy Pay, Instpower, the industry-leading power bank charging service, now accepts cryptocurrency payments in assets such as Bitcoin from its customers at over 14,000 sites across the globe, as per an Alchemy Pay press release on March 27.\n\nThe latest news of Parisian Burger King is a major milestone for both the global fast food giant and the widespread use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment for goods and services.\n\nCEO of the European distributor responsible for deploying Instpower machines, Yann Phu of Flash Development, is overjoyed that his company\u2019s products are now available in Paris:\n\n\u201cThis collaboration with Burger King in Paris has taken us to the next level with our operations in Europe. Instpower\u2019s machines will enable customers to power their devices while on the move.\u201d\n\nThe CEO added:\n\n\u201cIn Asia, these powerbanks are used widely, but in Europe, the market is only just beginning to embrace them. By having Alchemy Pay helping users to pay with crypto via Binance Pay, we are bringing cutting edge payment options to Europeans.\u201d\n\nBorderless payment option\n\nBecause of its borderless nature, crypto is a suitable payment option for Instpower\u2019s shared power banks, which travelers often use to charge their gadgets while on the road.\n\nTo facilitate the acceptance of cryptocurrency payments by brick-and-mortar and virtual storefronts alike, Alchemy Pay introduced the first hybrid merchant payment acceptance solution in 2019. Almost two million businesses in seventy or more countries participated in the fiat-crypto payment acceptance system in 2021.\n\nNotably, last year food industry giants KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut filed NFTs and metaverse trademarks in March, following in the footsteps of fellow fast-food chain competitor McDonald\u2019s (NYSE: MCD) decision to explore the metaverse."
