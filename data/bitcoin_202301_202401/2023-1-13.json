        "title": "Gorillas, militias, and Bitcoin: Why Congo\u2019s most famous national park is betting big on crypto - MIT Technology Review",
        "content": "That\u2019s why the park is a vital source for charcoal, or makala in Swahili, and for food\u2014even though farming, fishing, hunting, and logging are all illegal. Park resources are stripped with regularity: between 2001 and 2020, Virunga lost almost 10% of its tree cover, and de Merode estimates $170 million in Virunga\u2019s trees and ivory are lost annually. But the alternative for locals is being unable to pay local warlords or starving. These are perfect conditions for corruption.\n\n\"Congo is a bewildering place to make moral judgments.\"\n\n\u201cCongo is a bewildering place to make moral judgments,\u201d says Adam Hochschild, the author of King Leopold\u2019s Ghost, which chronicles the Belgian monarch\u2019s harrowing 19th-century rule. Congo is further complicated by \u201cits sheer vastness, people who speak hundreds of languages, and the colonization which was done for the purpose of extracting wealth,\u201d he says. \u201cUnder those circumstances, it\u2019s very hard to have a just and fair society.\u201d\n\nCongo has nearly as many displaced people as Ukraine, and decades of conflict despite decades of UN peacekeeping. Most stolen profits from the park go to armed rebel groups, which some locals join for lack of better options. Some are relics of past wars, most notably Rwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide. Others may be linked to the Islamic State. The largest is the M23, a Tutsi-led group so well-armed that the UN says Rwanda backs it. (Rwanda denies this, but its economy relies heavily on Congolese resources.)\n\nAs a result, Virunga may be the only UNESCO site that regularly buries its staff: over 200 rangers have been killed since 1996, on average one a month. Cherubin Nolayambaje, who has spent eight years as a ranger, calls it \u201cthe most dangerous job in the world.\u201d\n\nOver 200 park rangers have been killed since 1996, on average one a month. Here, rangers on early morning patrol look for animal snares, illegal fishing activity, and wood cutting. BRENT STIRTON/GETTY IMAGES\n\nVirunga\u2019s nearly 800 rangers, including about 35 women, often encounter armed rebels in the park and civilians farming or living there illegally. Many locals don\u2019t even know the park\u2019s boundaries, adds Samson Rukira, an activist in the nearby town of Rutshuru. While conservation requires community involvement to solve issues, he says, \u201cwe are in areas which are not secure, and that means maybe rangers can\u2019t be in dialogue.\u201d\n\nDe Merode is sympathetic to community complaints that individuals are being denied access to the park\u2019s vast wealth. \u201cHundreds of thousands, probably millions, of people suffer what we hope is a short-term cost to turn this park into a positive asset. If we fail in that, we do more harm than good,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we believe passionately that it can be turned around\u2014this ecosystem, this park.\u201d\n\nHis plan to do that hinges on the three hydro plants the park has opened since 2013, in Matebe, Mutwanga, and Luviro; a fourth is under construction. If you can power your home, the theory goes, you don\u2019t need to chop trees to cook. Electricity supports new jobs and businesses, like coffee coops and chia seed production. And, of course, the Bitcoin mine.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the misconception we most want to correct: that Virunga is just about the wildlife,\u201d de Merode continues. \u201cNo, it\u2019s about the community through the wildlife. Our role is to try to facilitate that.\u201d There\u2019s no way to practice conservation in one of the world\u2019s most troubled countries without local support, he says."

        "title": "15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at 15 countries where bitcoin is legal and illegal. For more countries, head on over to 5 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal.\n\n2022 has been a rough year for businesses, hedge funds, and the stock market but all these have not suffered as much as the cryptocurrency sector. Heralded at one time as the end of traditional fiat money, cryptocurrencies have taken a beating this year as rising interest rates and a souring economic sentiment led investors to flee from the highly speculative market to safe haven investments such as the U.S. dollar and bonds. As an example, Bitcoin, which is the world's leading cryptocurrency, is down by a studding 65% year to date as it nears levels before the pandemic crypto rush that saw capital flow to it from falling stock markets and stimulus checks.\n\nAt the same time, as cryptocurrencies surged, global momentum to make government let businesses accept them as a mode of payment and even as a legal tender grew alongside. However, government warnings about the risk of cryptocurrencies were also proven right just last month when the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX Trading Ltd. led to billions of dollars in losses for its customers. While initially portrayed as an 'honest mistake', charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the firm's founder and former chief executive officer Sam Bankman-Fried claim otherwise. According to a Reuters report, the main reason FTX collapsed was that, allegedly, Bankman-Fried and associates made changes to its algorithm which allowed the exchange's partner hedge fund Alameda Research to continue borrowing from it to make speculative investments even if Alameda's investments and its collateral dropped in value. The vicious cycle that bankrupted the firm started when Alameda's FTT tokens, issued by FTX, collapsed in value after Coinbase sold its holdings. This shattered consumer confidence in FTX and led to a massive withdrawal of consumer funds. However, since FTX had lent this money to Alameda for the investments, it was unable to cough up the cash, which then led to its demise.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe collapse of FTX also knocked the wind out of Bitcoin. After dropping from this year's peak of ~$47,000 to a ~$20,000 level that most analysts thought was the proverbial floor since it cost roughly the same to mine a Bitcoin, the currency would take another beating soon. The drama erupted on November 6th, when Coinbase announced its decision to sell the FTT holdings. Within the next three days as FTX's customers fled, Bitcoin also dropped from $20,905 to $15,757 - a level it was at during November 2022 - effectively wiping out two years of gains and profits for anyone who had entered trading during this time period. Since that fateful day, the currency is up by less than a thousand dollars, with Bitcoin currently worth $16,456 at the time of writing (see best bitcoin stocks to buy).\n\n15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal\n\nBitcoins\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this piece, we have divided the countries into two groups - where Bitcoin is implicitly legal and sometimes also a legal tender, and where it is absolutely banned. The countries where it is banned are listed first. Additionally, the legal frameworks of all countries analyzed for the piece do not differentiate between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, except for those countries that have made Bitcoin a legal tender.\n\n15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal\n\n15. People's Republic of China\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Illegal\n\nThe People's Republic of China is the world's largest economy by one measure and was one of the most popular regions for Bitcoin mining companies this decade due to the widespread adoption of technology. However, spurred into action due to the high environmental costs of mining and illicit activity, the Chinese government banned all cryptocurrency transactions in the country in 2021 when it forbade banks and other institutions from providing services such as clearing and exchange and made mining in the country illegal. However, such was the Bitcoin craze back then that the market simply shrugged off the announcement, and Bitcoin price continued to rise. Yet even though cryptocurrency trading is banned, the holding of it as an asset is protected by Chinese law according to a lawyer.\n\n14. State of Qatar\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Illegal\n\nThe state of Qatar is a Western Asian country located in the Middle East. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are completely banned in the country's Qatar Financial Center (QFC). Qatar states that the reason behind the ban is weak compliance with know your customer (KYC) and anti money laundering (AML) regulations. These regulations are enforced globally by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and they require banks and other financial services providers to verify their customer profiles and determine the source of funds that they are transferring inside and outside the country. In fact, the Qatari Central Bank was quick to warn citizens in May 2022 about dealing with any unregulated financial firm after CoinMENA, a Muslim law compliant exchange launched in the country. Qatar is a Muslim country and follows the Sharia Law.\n\n13. Kingdom of Belgium\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium is a Northern European country with a relatively high GDP per capita. Cryptocurrencies are not outlawed by Belgium and there are no significant barriers to either mining Bitcoin or others or using them for transactions. However, Bitcoin is not a legal tender in the country. Gains resulting from the trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are taxed under Belgium law, and authorities have often warned people about their speculative nature.\n\n12. Republic of Ireland\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is a sovereign state in Europe with a high income and one that is often criticized for its loose tax laws. There is no ban against either Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in the country, and the only regulations covering Bitcoin are those that are in place in the entire European Union. Taxes on Bitcoin are subject to the nature of the transaction, and the rates vary if it is regularly used or if rarely used.\n\n11. New Zealand\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nNew Zealand is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean. There is no specific legislation that bans the mining or trading of Bitcoin in the country. However, like others, New Zealand also taxes cryptocurrency transactions. Exchanges and other businesses must obtain a license from the government before providing services, and taxes are paid for selling Bitcoin if the intent behind the sale and the preceding purchase was to sell the currency and not hold it.\n\n10. Commonwealth of Australia\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Commonwealth of Australia is an Oceanic country that is rich in natural resources. There are no laws against either mining or transacting in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in Australia. However, Bitcoin is not equal to money in the country. Instead, the law treats Bitcoin as an asset that is held, and for companies, this includes taxation if the Bitcoin is part of daily operations or has been bought with the intention of making a profit.\n\n9. Netherlands\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Netherlands is a Northern European country that is one of the most prosperous regions in the world. The country does not have any specific laws to regulate cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin along with others generally has to follow the same regulatory framework for other financial products. The Dutch government also requires that Bitcoins should be disclosed on the annual tax returns and that a capital gains tax will be applied to them. Additionally, companies are required to convert their cryptocurrency payments into the Euro and declare them on the income statement.\n\n8. Swiss Confederation\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Swiss Confederation, commonly known as Switzerland is a landlocked European country with a high standard of living. Cryptocurrencies are classified as intangible assets in Swiss law, are not legal tender, and have no specific laws against in. On the individual level, Switzerland does not tax cryptocurrencies on any capital gains. However, for tax assessment, they must be converted to the Swiss Franc at the year's end at a rate provided by the government.\n\n7. Federal Republic of Germany\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany is a European nation with the largest economy on the continent. Germany requires a license for companies to deal in Bitcoin, and its regulators have called for a global framework to deal with cryptocurrencies as prices plunge globally and more links to established financial institutions are made. Germany also treats Bitcoin as private money, and banks in the country can also store and sell Bitcoin.\n\n6. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n\nBitcoin Legal or Illegal: Legal\n\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a European country located just off of the coast. There is no special regulatory framework for Bitcoin in the country, and the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies by individuals is subject to a capital gains tax which is payable on any gains that are made on disposal. For corporations, Bitcoin taxation in the U.K. depends on the nature of the transactions and whether they are one off or part of daily activity.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Countries Where Bitcoin is Legal and Illegal is originally published on Insider Monkey."

        "title": "Crypto mining hurt by falling bitcoin prices, rising energy costs - Marketplace",
        "content": "In late 2021, the price of a bitcoin topped $65,000. Since then, the price has fallen 70% and taken with it the fortunes of the once-burgeoning crypto mining industry.\n\nThose operations are involved in generating bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, often using sprawling stacks of computers that require a ton of electricity to stay running.\n\nSome states and municipalities have been vying to attract this industry for years. Others have been less welcoming, with critics charging that they are hurting clean energy goals across the country and around the world.\n\nThe crypto contingent at this month\u2019s CES in Las Vegas seemed eager to show it\u2019s not fazed by the current moment.\n\nSpeakers on a panel called \u201cHow to Stay Warm in a Crypto Winter\u201d were introduced this way: \u201cThese are not individuals who jumped in over the last two years during all of the craziness.\u201d\n\nIn other words: No crypto tourists here \u201cbut really the crypto OGs.\u201d\n\nThis crypto winter started early last year, months before the November collapse of FTX and the arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nFrom the CES convention floor, Sheila Warren, CEO of the industry group Crypto Council for Innovation, acknowledged those events haven\u2019t helped public perception.\n\nStill, \u201cthe thing I\u2019m certainly seeing here at CES is that this isn\u2019t going away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is definitely here to stay.\u201d\n\nBut the industry is certainly in trouble. That\u2019s especially true for the businesses that make their money mining cryptocurrencies. Across North America, shares in many of those firms have crashed, falling 90% or more over the last year.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is probably just the bitcoin price in general. It\u2019s fundamentally a different business when your revenue is cut by 70%,\u201d said Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer at Canadian mining operation Bitfarms.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of a key input shot up as the global energy crisis set in, said Ben Harper of Luxor Technologies, which provides software services to the industry.\n\n\u201cYou have this huge increase in power prices that\u2019s happened over the last year, and that\u2019s squeezed margins from the cost side,\u201d Harper said.\n\nBack when times were good, crypto mining farms were plowing cash into more mining computers. Stacks of them were set to be installed at the sprawling and very loud facility that Marketplace visited in Massena, New York, a year ago.\n\nMore machines are chasing the same prize these days, added Luxor\u2019s Harper. \u201cThe more mining on the number of fixed coins, obviously, the less revenue there is for any miner,\u201d he said.\n\nTheir collective crash has been welcomed by environmental groups organizing against energy-intensive crypto mining.\n\nIn upstate New York, the group Seneca Lake Guardian helped push for the nation\u2019s first statewide partial moratorium on new crypto mining, arguing those projects are at odds with New York\u2019s carbon reduction goals.\n\nA bitcoin mining facility is seen in Niagara Falls, New York in October 2022. The state passed a partial moratorium on new crypto mining late last year. (Geoff Robins/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nYvonne Taylor said crypto\u2019s travails have helped her group gain traction in their local fight against a crypto miner operating at a fossil-fuel power plant in their community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty validating, because we\u2019ve been raising the alarm and shouting our concerns at the top of our lungs for literally years about this facility,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nNorth of the border, two Canadian provinces \u2014 Manitoba and Quebec \u2014 are using different tactics to limit crypto mining.\n\nAnd even though there are still some green pastures for miners, including states that offer subsidies to them, crypto investor Bradley Tusk of Tusk Ventures warns the industry needs a wake-up call.\n\n\u201cThey need to get much more politically sophisticated. If they don\u2019t start to be smarter, more proactive, and more aggressive, they\u2019re going to be completely banned from doing what they do entirely,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nTusk added that\u2019s true for crypto miners \u2014 and the crypto industry as a whole. \u201cIf you don\u2019t step up, you\u2019re gonna get wiped out.\u201d\n\nAlthough there\u2019s new legislation to crack down on crypto mining nationally, for opponents like Thomas Cmar, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, the effort against the industry has largely been a state-by-state fight.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re chasing electricity prices,\u201d Cmar said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to use large volumes of electricity \u2014 regardless of where it comes from \u2014 at a very critical time for our country\u2019s policies on climate.\u201d\n\nEven after a rough year, there\u2019s still plenty of crypto mining activity, Cmar said. And if the crypto miners lose in one state or province, many are prepared to pack up and move to another.\n\nAn abridged version of the above story appeared on a Jan. 19 episode of \u201cMarketplace Morning Report.\u201d You can listen to the condensed audio version below."

        "title": "Bitcoin surges past $21,000 as investors bet it\u2019s bottomed and inflation has peaked - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin surged over $21,000 on Saturday amid optimism that it may have bottomed and inflation has peaked.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 7.5% to $21,299, before paring gains as the day progressed. It hadn\u2019t been above $20,000 since Nov. 8, and Saturday was the 11th straight day of advances. Second-largest token Ether surged as much as 9.7%, and others such as Cardano and Dogecoin also notched gains. Solana soared as much as 35%.\n\nThe overall market cap of the crypto universe rose above $1 trillion for the first time since early November, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\n\u201cThere has been a steady grind higher since the start of the year,\u201d said Cici Lu, chief executive officer of Venn Link Partners Pte. \u201cIt feels like we hit a supply \u2018air pocket\u2019 and breaking through $20,000 resistance took out some stops. Optically, $20,000 for many is a key level.\u201d\n\nUS short-term inflation expectations fell in early January to the lowest in nearly two years, providing a bigger-than-expected boost to consumer sentiment, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary survey reading. A separate report showed consumer prices rising 6.5% in the 12 months through December, marking the slowest inflation rate in more than a year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is on track to downshift to smaller interest-rate increases following the further cooling in prices, though it\u2019s likely to keep hiking until pressures show more definitive signs of slowing. That\u2019s helped boost risk assets like the Nasdaq 100 stock index, which has gained for six straight days.\n\n\u201cCryptoassets performed well following the soft CPI print, suggesting that crypto\u2019s correlation to macro is not going away anytime soon,\u201d said Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat. \u201cThis week\u2019s follow-through in price action is certainly encouraging,\u201d and barring any forced liquidations from troubled crypto company DCG, \u201cthere is a high probability that the absolute bottom is in for crypto prices.\u201d\n\nThe price of Bitcoin was stuck in a narrow range around $16,000 to $17,000 for weeks before the latest breakout. The upward moves have caught shorts by surprise \u2014 crypto short liquidations have topped $100 million in five of the past six days, according to data from Coinglass. Saturday\u2019s total was the highest, topping $449 million.\n\nKatie Stockton, co-founder of Fairlead Strategies, offered a caution about the rally, which has taken Bitcoin above its 200-day moving average for the first time in a year.\n\n\u201cDeeply overbought short-term readings challenge positive momentum, so we would not chase the rally at these levels,\u201d she said in a note Friday. She sees resistance near $21,500, where there\u2019s a 61% Fibonacci retracement level.\n\nStill, the upward trajectory could inject even further optimism into a market that\u2019s been struggling to find good news in recent months.\n\n\u201cDeclining CPI coupled with the announcement that the FTX liquidators have recovered $5 billion in liquid assets have given crypto markets plenty of factors to forget the macro picture, which is still bearish,\u201d said Hayden Hughes, chief executive officer of social-trading platform Alpha Impact. \u201cMarkets have plenty of positive momentum heading into the next FOMC meeting later this month.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin prices to start the new year have been slightly leaning towards the upside. However, it could be another volatile year for the cryptocurrency market as it slowly limps into 2023.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies have crept into the new year, licking their wounds after the carnage of 2022,\u201d reported Reuters. \u201cThe overall global crypto market cap has risen 5% to $871 billion since Jan. 1, but it\u2019s still down over 57% from this time last year.\u201d\n\nTo end 2022, bitcoin was stuck in a sideways motion trap. It\u2019s been relatively quiet in terms of volatility, but that could just be the proverbial calm before the storm.\n\n\u201cBitcoin itself has gained 4.3% since the start of 2023, though stuck in a narrow range between $16,500 and $17,300,\u201d the report added. \u201cThe world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency is eerily subdued, with its 7-day volatility dropping to levels not seen since October 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.\u201d\n\nPatience Is Required\n\nWith the cryptocurrency market entering a maturation phase, especially after last year\u2019s drubbing, gone are the days where quick and easy gains could be attained. Analysts are preaching patience in a cryptocurrency market that could be headed for another year of fluctuating price movements \u2014 an environment where patience is indeed a virtue.\n\n\u201cIt will be a year for the patient, as we do not anticipate prices nearing former all-time highs in 2023,\u201d said Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at Arcane Research, in the same Reuters report.\n\nOne of the biggest indicators of potential upside, or even downside, is trading volumes. The activity in cryptocurrency trading volumes could provide insight on what to expect for 2023, and right now, volumes are relatively staid, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency spot trading volumes remain similarly muted after slumping about 48% in December versus the previous month to $544 billion, their lowest level since December 2019, CryptoCompare data showed,\u201d reported Reuters.\n\nThat\u2019s not a surprising metric given last year\u2019s downside in the crypto market, which could have essentially provided the digital assets market with a much-needed cleansing. Given the bull run in 2021, speculation was reaching fever pitch, especially with the entry of institutional money.\n\nThat said, a new type of investor could emerge amid the chaos. One that focuses on bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a long-term growth option as opposed to a fly-by-night money-maker via high-speed trading \u2014 that could be a good thing for the crypto market in order for it to survive in the long run as a viable asset alongside stocks, bonds, and other traditional asset classes.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

Have you heard about Bitcoin and Ethereum, but aren\u2019t sure if you can buy one with the other? Look no further! In this blog post, we\u2019ll be exploring the ins and outs of buying Bitcoin with Ethereum.\n\nHow to buy bitcoin with ethereum\n\nEthereum and Bitcoin are both digital currencies that are becoming more widely accepted. Since these two virtual coins are both popular with investors, it makes sense to explore the possibility of using one to purchase the other. By understanding how to buy bitcoin with ethereum, you can open up a new way of investing that could help you grow your portfolio.\n\nWhen it comes to buying bitcoin with ethereum, there are several steps that must be followed in order to complete a successful purchase:\n\nGet a suitable Ethereum wallet: Make sure the wallet you choose is secure and allows you to make purchases safely. Some wallets may also require the use of two-factor authentication or other forms of security. Connect your wallet directly to an exchange: Most exchanges allow users to transfer funds directly from their Ethereum wallets without having an intermediary party involved in the transaction. Calculate fees: Before making any purchases, make sure you understand what fees might be associated with your transaction, especially if you\u2019re buying from an exchange that isn\u2019t based in your own country or jurisdiction. Buy Bitcoin through an exchange: After connecting your Ethereum wallet to an exchange and calculating any applicable fees, you can then start buying Bitcoin directly from the platform by placing prices accordingly and responding quickly when those higher offer prices come along!\n\nHow to find the best bitcoin exchange to buy bitcoin with ethereum\n\nWhen deciding which Bitcoin exchange to use, it is important to consider a few factors:\n\nAmount of Bitcoin that the exchange offers and the fees associated with buying or selling them.\n\nthat the exchange offers and the fees associated with buying or selling them. Liquidity of the exchange and how quickly it can be bought or sold.\n\nof the exchange and how quickly it can be bought or sold. User reviews \u2013 are there any customer service issues or bug reports that can help you make a decision?\n\n\u2013 are there any customer service issues or bug reports that can help you make a decision? Security of each exchange and whether or not there have been any prior hacking attempts.\n\nFinding a reliable Bitcoin exchange requires research into available exchanges, particularly those that accept Ethereum as an alternative payment method in addition to fiat currencies like USD or EUR. Some popular exchanges offer both crypto-to-crypto trading along with fiat-to-crypto trading while others may have only one option available. Many exchanges also offer margin trading (trading on leverage) which may significantly increase your risk but can also potentially bring higher profits if handled well. Leverage should only be used by advanced traders who understand its risks!\n\nMany users choose to secure their own wallets as best protection against theft or losses due to scams; this will require additional research into best practices for securely storing cryptocurrency assets safely offline before making trades on any given platform.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to buying Bitcoin with Ethereum, it is important to evaluate the costs and benefits. Exchange rates vary from exchange to exchange, and the fees associated with buying or trading cryptocurrencies can add up quickly. It is recommended that potential buyers research the different exchanges available and use caution when transferring funds from one platform to another.\n\nMany exchanges offer users the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin with Ethereum through a cryptocurrency contract for difference (CFD). Before investing in crypto-assets, users should be aware of the risks associated with trading and ensure that they are comfortable assuming those risks. With careful attention and due diligence, it can be possible for investors to safely buy Bitcoin using their Ethereum holdings."

According to the Fear and Greed Index, a crypto-specific metric that measures sentiment using five weighted sources, investors\u2019 feelings about the market hit a monthly high.\n\nBitcoin Fear and Greed index. Source: alternative.me\n\nBitcoin price is now above the psychologically important $21,000 level and many analysts and traders are issuing their thoughts on where BTC price could head next.\n\nLet\u2019s explore a few of these perspectives.\n\nBitcoin trading volumes remain a concern\n\nBitcoin price has yet to recover from its pre-FTX levels but reached above $21,095 on Jan. 13 for the first time since Nov. 8, 2022. Despite the strength of the recent rally, some analysts believe BTC price needs to remain above the $21,000 support before the current bullish trend can be sustained.\n\nAccording to Glassnode analysis:\n\n\u201cA renewed bullish trend that started on January 1st drove bitcoin to the $18.6 - $18.9k level, yet a cross over to $19k is necessary to claim a new trading channel around $19-$21k. Resistance is expected around these levels as bitcoin faces a mid-term downward trend. If the price fails to break over the trend line, we expect a retrace toward the $16-$17k area.\u201d\n\nBTC price compared to volume. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe lack of trading volume of around $18,000 shows the weakness in the current on-chain and centralized exchange (CEX) activity. The largest volumes and overall activity seem to surround the $16,000 level, suggesting that is a more solid floor than the current price range. With less volume surrounding levels higher than $21,000, Bitcoin\u2019s rally could be capped at $21,095.\n\nIs it just a bear market rally?\n\nBitcoin is still facing headwinds including massive exchange layoffs in a tightening macro economy, Gemini and Genesis legal issues and the potential establishment of a U.S. House crypto-focused subcommittee.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) is currently showing BTC as overbought. According to RSI analysis, a sharp downtrend may form as the price corrects.\n\nBitcoin RSI. Source: TradingView\n\nThe macro markets are also at major resistance levels. The United States Dollar index (DXY) is at key support which means risk assets like Bitcoin may start to see a sell-off if the index recovers. Bitcoin remains correlated to equities and the SPX mini futures index is also showing signs of a pullback.\n\nTraderSZ explains below:\n\n$BTC - huge resistance here...dxy at key support...ES looking like it could pullback abit, eth at macro mid range...been up only all week so could get some profit taking/pullback....arrow would be my trigger IF it follows plan pic.twitter.com/6JziAmBywH \u2014 TraderSZ (@trader1sz) January 12, 2023\n\nWith Bitcoin investors taking profits as suggested by TraderSZ, it may be tough for BTC to reach higher levels.\n\nHistorical analysis points to a new Bitcoin bottom\n\nBitcoin is currently below its 200-week moving average and according to independent market analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin price may have already hit its macro bottom according to historical data.

If traders match the bear market that followed between 2017 to 2018 and 2021 to the current market, it would take 1,001 days until Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high.\n\n$BTC #Bitcoin\n\n2015-2017 bull market: 1064 days\n\n2017-2018 bear market: 364 days\n\n\n\n2018-2021 bull market: 1064 days\n\n2021-*current* market low: 364 days\n\n\n\nDays left until the top if we just carbon copy the cycle timeframe again: 1001 days pic.twitter.com/KoNZxJRuy5 \u2014 HornHairs (@CryptoHornHairs) January 12, 2023\n\nDespite the current conditions and the strength of the current price breakout, Bitcoin has proven many technical analysts wrong in the past.

        "content": "What happened\n\nThe cryptocurrency market suddenly came to life on Friday night for the first time since FTX collapsed in early November. Nearly every asset was up big, and some with ties to FTX are significantly higher.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 2.53%) jumped 10.9% and is trading at $20,909 at 8 a.m. ET, surpassing the $20,000 level for the first time since FTX became insolvent in early November. Ethereum (ETH 1.92%) is up 10.1% in the last day to $1,540 and Solana (SOL 1.36%) is the big mover, popping 36.1% to $22.53.

Trading on weekends often leads to some of the biggest moves, as traders take time off and there's less liquidity (buyers and sellers) in the market.\n\nFueling some of the moves is liquidations of short positions. According to coinglass.com, $730 million of short positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours with $240 million of that being in Bitcoin, $261 million in Ethereum, and $26.3 million of Solana short trades.\n\nThe two macro news items this week were inflation data that showed a reduction in prices over the past month, leading to speculation the Federal Reserve will soon stop raising rates and may even be forced to lower rates sooner than expected. This pushed growth stocks and high-risk assets higher this week, but the momentum really hit crypto hard on Friday evening into Saturday morning.\n\nSince FTX got us here, it may in part be FTX that has driven the rally. By that, I mean that liquidators of FTX's assets have recovered $5 billion in assets to return to customers and they've been selling leveraged positions as quickly as possible. That added selling pressure to a market with lower liquidity, and when added to the short positions this can drop prices. But when they slow selling and short positions get liquidated (as they have today), the bounce higher can be swift.\n\nNow what\n\nThe price of cryptocurrencies fundamentally comes down to supply and demand. Supply isn't rising very quickly, so demand is the key. When FTX collapsed and the crypto winter wore on, many investors and traders either gave up on the market or took short positions to take advantage of weakness. But over time there should be more and more users of the blockchain, helped lately by significant corporate interest.\n\nI think the long-term trend for cryptocurrencies is still higher, but the volatility seen over the last two months will continue. There needs to be more use cases that disrupt old businesses or create new businesses, and that's when mass adoption will come. That's why Solana is my top cryptocurrency long term, given its low costs and high speed. But a rising tide lifts all boats, and bullishness on crypto overall is helping everything trade higher today."

Source: TradingView\n\n\u201cHopeful skepticism\u201d is probably the best description of most investors\u2019 sentiment at the moment, especially after the recent struggles of recapturing a $1 trillion market capitalization in early November. That rally to $1 trillion was followed by a 27.6% correction in three days and it invalidated any bullish momentum that traders might have expected.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has gained 15.7% year-to-date, but a different scenario has emerged for altcoins, with a handful of them gaining 50% or more in the same period. Some investors attribute the rally to the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released on Jan. 12, which confirmed the thesis that inflation was continuing to drop.\n\nWhile the macroeconomic conditions might have improved, the situation for cryptocurrency companies seems gloomy. New York-based Metropolitan Commercial Bank (MCB) announced on Jan. 9 that it would close its crypto-assets vertical, citing changes in the regulatory landscape and recent setbacks in the industry. Crypto-related clients accounted for 6% of the bank\u2019s total deposits.\n\nOn Jan. 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged cryptocurrency lending firm Genesis Global Capital and crypto exchange Gemini with offering unregistered securities through Gemini\u2019s Earn program.\n\nA final blow came on Jan. 13 after Crypto.com announced a new wave of staff layoffs on Jan. 13, reducing the global workforce by 20%. Other crypto exchanges that recently announced job cuts in the last month include Kraken, Coinbase and Huobi.\n\nDespite the dreadful newsflow, the macroeconomic tailwinds favoring risk assets ensured that only UNUS SED (LEO) closed the first 13 days of 2023 in the red.\n\nWeekly winners and losers among the top 80 coins. Source: Nomics\n\nLido DAO (LDO) gained 108% as investors expect the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade that enables staked Ether withdrawals to boost the demand for liquid staking protocols.\n\nAptos (APT) rallied 98% after some decentralized applications started to pick up volume, including Liquidswap decentralized exchange (DEX), Ditto Finance staking and yield and nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace Topaz Market.\n\nOptimism (OP) gained 70% after the layer-2 network picked up activity and, combined with its competitor Arbiturm, surpassed Ethereum\u2019s main chain transactions.\n\nLeverage demand is balanced between bulls and bears\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours. Exchanges use this fee to avoid exchange risk imbalances.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. However, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on Jan. 13. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 7-day funding rate was near zero for Bitcoin and altcoins, meaning the data points to a balanced demand between leverage longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers).\n\nIf bears are paying 0.3% per week to maintain their leveraged bets on Solana (SOL) and BNB (BNB), that adds up to a mere 1.2% per month \u2014 which is not relevant for most traders.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price rallies to $19K, but analyst says a $17.3K retest could happen next\n\nTraders\u2019 demand for neutral-to-bullish options has spiked\n\nTraders can gauge the market\u2019s overall sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30%, which is bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options by 40%, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: laevitas.ch\n\nBetween Jan. 4 and Jan. 6, the protective put options dominated the space as the indicator soared above 1. The movement eventually faded and the opposite situation emerged as the demand for neutral-to-bullish call options has been in excess since Jan. 7.\n\nThe lack of leverage shorts and demand for protective puts points toward a bull trend\n\nConsidering the 15.7% gain since the start of 2023, derivatives metrics reflect zero signs of demand from leverage shorts or protective put options. While bulls can celebrate that the $900 billion total market capitalization resistance faced little resistance, derivatives metrics show bears are still patiently waiting for an entry point for their shorts.\n\nConsidering the market's bearish newsflow, the bulls\u2019 main hope remains solely in the framework of a favorable macroeconomic environment, which largely depends on how retail sales data reports next week.\n\nChina is also expected to release its economic figures on Jan. 16 and the U.S. will do the same on Jan. 18. Another potential impact on price could be the United Kingdom\u2019s CPI print which is set to be announced on Jan. 18.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

But I would argue that, you know, places like Asia, particularly Hong Kong, are starting to look pretty attractive with their virtual asset policies, [...] with their desire to basically be a leader in the space.\u201d\n\nA lack of regulatory clarity has often been cited as the reason why so much crypto activity is leaving the United States, and has prompted lawmakers to push for crypto regulations as soon as possible."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss went from being the co-originators of Facebook deceived by Mark Zuckerberg (as dramatized in the film \u201cThe Social Network\u201d) to early crypto adopters who became \"Bitcoin billionaires.\" Now their firm has been charged by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe SEC hit the twins\u2019 cryptocurrency exchange Gemini with charges of securities violations on Thursday due to its Gemini Earn program, which promised a return to customers who deposited their crypto holdings. Genesis, its lending partner in the program and a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), was also charged in tandem with Gemini.\n\nThe charges come after several weeks of increasingly public disputes between Gemini and DCG leadership following November\u2019s collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which triggered a fresh wave of industry contagion as funds stored on FTX were either locked away or missing. Genesis is reportedly on the hook for more than $900 million worth of Gemini customer funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow did it come to this? Here\u2019s a look at the Winklevoss twins\u2019 rapid rise in the crypto industry and the recent moves that led to a public spat between Gemini and DCG, the SEC charges, and an apparently vast hole in Gemini\u2019s finances.\n\nFounding Gemini\n\nThe Winklevoss twins received some $65 million in cash and Facebook stock in the 2008 settlement over the creation of the social media giant. After establishing family office Winklevoss Capital in 2012, the brothers began amassing large amounts of Bitcoin. The twins owned as much as 1% of the circulating supply of the leading cryptocurrency as of November 2013, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThey went from buying up a stash of Bitcoin to leading an investment round in BitInstant, an early Bitcoin exchange whose founder Charlie Shrem was later imprisoned for money laundering related to the Silk Road marketplace. Also that year, the twins attempted to launch the first-ever Bitcoin ETF (or exchange-traded fund), which was rejected by the SEC.\n\nIn 2015, the Winklevoss brothers opened Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange licensed in its home state of New York. The platform expanded over the years and acquired NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway in 2019, ahead of the eventual NFT market boom in 2021. Parent company Gemini Space Station was valued at $7.1 billion as of November 2021.\n\nCameron and Tyler were deemed \u201cBitcoin billionaires\u201d for the first time in 2017 (as chronicled in the Ben Mezrich book of the same name) as Bitcoin\u2019s price surged to nearly $20,000, and Forbes currently estimates each brother to have a net worth of $1.1 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut with the crypto industry in turmoil over the past several months, Gemini and its founders have faced new challenges. In June 2022, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged Gemini \u201cfor making material false or misleading statements\u201d as it sought approval of its Bitcoin futures product, and Gemini laid off 10% of its staff as the crypto market tumbled.\n\nGemini vs. Genesis\n\nA fresh wave of crypto industry turmoil sparked Gemini\u2019s recent troubles, kick-started by the early November collapse of crypto exchange FTX and sister trading firm Alameda Research.\n\nSoon after, Genesis announced that it would suspend customer withdrawals from its lending arm due to the \u201cFTX impact,\u201d citing \u201cunprecedented market turmoil\u201d in being unable to continue business as usual. Genesis was Gemini\u2019s partner for its interest-bearing Earn product, and Gemini said that it would have to freeze customer funds as a result.\n\nIn December, the Financial Times reported that Genesis held some $900 million worth of customer funds from the Gemini Earn program. Digital Currency Group\u2014which owns Genesis, Grayscale Investments, and other crypto firms\u2014is allegedly dealing with liquidity problems, according to Cameron Winklevoss, although founder and CEO Barry Silbert has assured investors otherwise.\n\nAt the start of 2023, the private negotiations between Gemini and Genesis spilled into public when Winklevoss penned an open letter to Silbert. In the letter, he accused Silbert of \u201cbad faith stall tactics\u201d towards finding a resolution to the dispute over the funds, suggesting evasive tactics on the part of the DCG head. Silbert denied the accusations.\n\nThe allegations intensified on January 10 as Cameron Winklevoss called for Silbert\u2019s resignation, suggesting misrepresentation and accounting fraud at DCG. The company responded by calling Winklevoss\u2019 claims \u201canother desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt\u201d on the part of the Gemini founders, which it said were \u201csolely responsible for operating Gemini Earn and marketing the program to its customers.\u201d\n\nGemini then announced that it had officially terminated its Earn program, which it said would force Genesis to pay back what it said is over $900 million worth of customer funds that it holds. The program had operated for nearly two years in partnership between Gemini and Genesis.\n\nSEC charges\n\nThat situation remains unresolved as of this writing, but now both Gemini and Genesis both face a new hurdle in the form of the SEC charges related to Gemini Earn. The agency alleges that the firms sold unregistered securities to customers, raising billions of dollars\u2019 worth of crypto in the process from hundreds of thousands of users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"We allege that Genesis and Gemini offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. \"Today's charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws.\"\n\nIn a tweet response, Tyler Winklevoss questioned the timing of the charges, saying that Gemini had been in discussions with the SEC for 17 months and that the program was regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services.\n\n1/ It\u2019s disappointing that the @SECGov chose to file an action today as @Gemini and other creditors are working hard together to recover funds. This action does nothing to further our efforts and help Earn users get their assets back. Their behavior is totally counterproductive. \u2014 Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) January 12, 2023\n\n\u201cDespite these ongoing conversations, the SEC chose to announce their lawsuit to the press before notifying us. Super lame,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that they\u2019re optimizing for political points instead of helping us advance the cause of 340,000 Earn users and other creditors.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cGemini has always worked hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations.\u201d Genesis and DCG have yet to comment on the SEC charges."

That change represents a 12% increase in 24 hours.\n\nData also shows that $245 million of shorts have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, while $255 million of Bitcoin was bought on spot markets today.\n\nThere are no major events that could have had an obvious positive effect on investor activity. Rather, changing investor sentiment may be due to a lack of bad news \u2014 and due to the fact that major crises like FTX\u2019s collapse are fading into the past.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s gains today represent ongoing growth over the past several days. This week, positive anticipation and sentiment toward a Consumer Price Index (CPI) announcement appeared to contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s price growth.\n\nThe round number of $20,000 also represents a psychological barrier, and as such, investors may be optimistic now that Bitcoin has crossed it.\n\nBitcoin typically leads the crypto market, and its performance today contributed to the crypto market\u2019s overall growth. The entire crypto market cap was up 8% over the past 24 hours, and it now has a market cap of $1.02 trillion.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and the entire crypto market outperformed the stock market today. The Dow Jones was up 0.3% today, while the S&P 500 was up 0.4%.\n\nHowever, some altcoins have seen modest growth compared to Bitcoin. Ethereum was up 9.8%, while XRP, BNB, and Polygon each gained close to 6%. It remains to be seen whether the crypto market will continue to trend upward."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, briefly crossed the $19,000 mark on Thursday following favorable December inflation data. Additionally, investors cheered news that an FTX attorney told a U.S. bankruptcy court about the crypto exchange recovering over $5 billion in liquid assets.\n\n\u201cWe have located over $5 billion of cash, liquid cryptocurrency and liquid investment securities,\u201d FTX\u2019s attorney Andy Dietderich told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey in Delaware, per Reuters. Dietderich added that FTX plans to sell nonstrategic investments worth $4.6 billion in book value. However, Dietderich said that the actual customer shortfall remains unknown.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, over $8 billion of customer funds are missing. Meanwhile, on Thursday, FTX\u2019s disgraced former CEO and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried denied stealing funds in an online post on Substack.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t steal funds, and I certainly didn\u2019t stash billions away,\u201d wrote Bankman-Fried. Furthermore, he stated that FTX\u2019s sister company Alameda Research collapsed as it was not \u201cadequately hedged\u201d for the crypto market crash. Bankman-Fried was released in December 2022 on a $250 million recognizance bond. Earlier this month, he pleaded not guilty to eight federal charges, including fraud and money laundering. His trial will begin in October 2023.\n\nLast year, soaring interest rates impacted investors\u2019 appetite for risky assets like crypto. Bitcoin has fallen more than 55% over the past year. Moreover, the collapse of FTX has sparked concerns about the numerous risks associated with the crypto market, further weighing on Bitcoin and crypto-based stocks. The 0.1% decline in December Consumer Price Index (CPI) has fueled hopes of less aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which is favorable for crypto and growth stocks.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of American business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, has shared what he thinks will happen to bitcoin (BTC) in the next eight years while outlining how it will come into play.\n\nIn a recent interview with Cory Klippsten, the founder and CEO of Swan Bitcoin, Saylor noted that he sees bitcoin becoming a global store of value by 2031.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nAccording to him, institutional adoption is one of the first drivers of the digital asset\u2019s global store of value status in the coming years. The bitcoin proponent believes institutional adoption is possible through the \u201cutterances\u201d of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and decisions by traditional financial institutions.\n\nSaylor mentioned some traditional financial institutions, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, that are beginning to embrace bitcoin in recent times due to its potential despite previously distancing themselves from the asset.\n\nThe Explosion of Lightning Network\n\nThe MicroStrategy co-founder also cited the explosive growth of the Lightning Network as another factor that will make the digital asset a global store of value.\n\nThe Lightning Network is a layer-2 solution built on the bitcoin protocol to make transactions faster and cheaper. Interestingly, MicroStrategy plans to develop applications powered by the Lightning Network that could reach millions of users.\n\nAccording to Saylor, developing \u201ckiller apps\u201d like Lightning Wallets that move digital dollars and BTC and swaps in and out of local currency will create massive demand for the asset.\n\n\u201cI just describe this as in 1991, you had TCP IP, and we had the internet, but not many people used it. In 1994, you had the Netscape browser, and now that was the killer app for the internet, and pretty soon you had 100 million people download that browser and it caught fire,\u201d he said.\n\nMacroeconomic Headwinds\n\nThe billionaire also noted that macroeconomic headwinds, such as the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, are major factors that will help bitcoin achieve a global store of value status.\n\nTo tame inflation, the Fed raised the federal funds rate seven times in 2022, with more expected to happen this year. Saylor stated that inflation would increase once the Fed reduces its interest rate hikes which will be a marketing driver for the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the MicroStrategy executive chairman, the combination of these factors will \u201cplay out against the new reality: bitcoin is the only digital commodity, it is the only crypto asset, and there is no second best crypto asset.\u201d"

        "content": "For the first time since early November, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry exceeded $1 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nOn January 14, Bitcoin increased to over $21,000 on hopes that inflation may have peaked and reached a bottom. The biggest cryptocurrency increased up to 7.5% to $21,299 in value. Since November 8 it hadn't been above $20,000, and January 14 was its 11th straight day of growth. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, rose up to 9.7%, and other coins like Cardano and Dogecoin also registered significant gains.\n\nBefore this most recent breakout, the price of Bitcoin had been trapped in a small range between $16,000 and $17,000 for weeks. The rising movements have surprised shorts; according to statistics from Coinglass, cryptocurrency short liquidations have exceeded $100 million in five of the last six days. The biggest amount was reached on January 14 and exceeded $296 million.\n\nThe increases coincided with consumer pricing data released last week that indicated a decline in inflation from December levels to January levels. Following that additional cooling, the Federal Reserve is on course to transition to smaller interest-rate rises, but it's expected to keep doing so until price pressures show more certain indications of moderating. Risky assets, such as the Nasdaq 100 stock index, which has increased for six days in a row, have benefited from this.\n\nFollowing the soft CPI print, cryptoassets fared nicely, indicating that the correlation between crypto and macro is not about to disappear any time soon, as per Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat. The price action that has continued this week is undoubtedly positive, and barring any forced liquidations by the financially challenged crypto business DCG, there is a strong likelihood that the absolute bottom has been reached for cryptocurrency pricing.\n\nThe macroeconomic environment, which is still gloomy, has been overshadowed by the declining CPI and the news that the FTX liquidators had recovered $5 billion in cash assets, as per Hayden Hughes, chief executive officer of social-trading platform Alpha Impact. Going into the upcoming FOMC meeting later this month, the markets are moving strongly in the right direction, he added.\n\n(With Bloomberg inputs)\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "Have the Bitcoin Variants Faded from Existence? - Securities.io",
        "content": "There are over 100 different Bitcoin variants or hard forks. Some popular variants still in existence include Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. The Bitcoin code is open source, therefore, its code could be forked to create a different version.\n\nMost of the Bitcoin variants were created to solve scalability and security issues perceived by some members of the Bitcoin community. Oftentimes, there are divisions in the Bitcoin community when a core-code-changing or parameter-altering upgrade is proposed. The debates these proposed upgrades cause in the Bitcoin community leads to the forking of the Bitcoin network sometimes.\n\nBitcoin variants are created from a hard fork of the Bitcoin network. When changes are proposed to an existing blockchain, the changes are carried out either through a soft fork or a hard fork.\n\nA soft fork is a type of backward-compatible upgrade to a blockchain network. A soft fork does not change the underlying rules or the parameters of a blockchain. An example of a soft fork is SegWit \u2013 a soft fork change in the transaction format of Bitcoin.\n\nA hard fork is a type of radical upgrade to a blockchain network. When there is a hard fork, a chain is split; miners and validator nodes choose which chain they continue to validate. A hard fork leads to the creation of a new blockchain network from the existing blockchain. Hard forks often occur to add a proposed functionality, to a blockchain to correct a security risk, or to roll back blockchain transactions.\n\nAn instance where blockchain transactions were rolled back was in 2016. The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization built on Ethereum, was exploited by attackers. Part of the Ethereum community decided to roll back all the DAO-related transactions, allowing the DAO contributors to reclaim their funds. Some members of the Ethereum community supported the hard fork to roll back the transactions, while others were against it. After the controversial hard fork, the newly created blockchain retained the name Ethereum (ETH), while the existing (old) blockchain is now known as Ethereum Classic (ETC),\n\nA detailed article on the difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic can be found on Securities.io.\n\nNotable Bitcoin Hard Forks\n\nMost of Bitcoin\u2019s hard forks are mainly a result of proposed upgrades to improve the security, scalability, and decentralization of the network, or to solve a perceived problem. Some hard forks that were initially successful have been altogether abandoned by their communities and seen zero adoption; others are still actively traded on exchanges and fairly used in peer-to-peer (p2p) transactions.\n\nBitcoin XT\n\nBitcoin XT was launched in 2014 by Mike Hearn, a former Bitcoin developer. The hard fork hoped to solve the Bitcoin scalability issues by an increase in block size. The proposal was formalized in Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 101 (BIP 101). Bitcoin XT hard fork launched in August 2015; its block size was 8 megabytes \u2013 an eight times increase from Bitcoin\u2019s 1-megabyte block size.\n\nDespite initial interest in Bitcoin XT, with over 1,000 nodes running the Bitcoin XT software, users\u2019 and node operators\u2019 interest in the new Bitcoin fork waned very quickly as major miners refused to support the project.\n\nThe Bitcoin XT hard fork influences Bitcoin fork proposals to this day. Subsequent hard forks have mostly implemented a block size increase.\n\nBitcoin Gold\n\nMoving away from block size contention typically witnessed in Bitcoin forks, Bitcoin Gold\u2019s hard fork sought to make Bitcoin a more decentralized network. Bitcoin Gold uses the proof-of-work consensus algorithm similar to its pre-fork version. However, Bitcoin Gold favors mining on less specialized hardware.\n\nBitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm and favors ASIC mining equipment, which is expensive to procure and run. Bitcoin Gold uses the Equihash algorithm and supports GPU mining, or mining using a graphics card. Bitcoin Gold aimed to make crypto mining more accessible.\n\nThe developers and supporters of Bitcoin Gold argue that as Bitcoin is only mined using expensive hardware, it creates the possibility of having only a handful of miners control the network, which goes against the tenets of decentralization. By allowing mining operations on less expensive, more available hardware, more miners could join the network, reducing the chances of a 51% attack \u2013 an attack on a crypto network in which a miner or a group of colluding miners control more than 50% of the network\u2019s hash rate. When a miner or group of miners own or control more than 50% of the network, it could lead to double-spend and other network vulnerabilities.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nRelentlessly following in Bitcoin XT\u2019s footsteps, Bitcoin cash sought to make the Bitcoin network scalable by increasing the block size of the network. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s block size is 8 megabytes, similar to that of Bitcoin XT.\n\nBitcoin Cash came about in May 2017 following discussions in the Bitcoin community to implement a scaling solution known as the Segwit2x upgrade. This led to debates within the Bitcoin community. SegWit2x was never implemented. Those in favor of a larger block size decided to create the hard fork called Bitcoin Cash.\n\nBitcoin Cash was designed to be a cheaper and peer-to-peer system. The block size of Bitcoin Cash is dynamic \u2013 it increases over time. The Bitcoin Cash block size started at 8 megabytes but has since grown to 32 megabytes block size.\n\nBitcoin SV\n\nBitcoin Satoshi Vision (SV) was not a direct hard fork of the Bitcoin network; it was a hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash network. Bitcoin SV was created by Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, the controversial self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakomoto. Just like most hard forks that preceded it, Bitcoin SV was created to solve the scalability problem PoW blockchains face.\n\nBitcoin SV started with a block size of 128 megabytes. Less than a year after its creation, the Bitcoin SV network underwent an upgrade called Quasar. The upgrade increased the network\u2019s block size to 2 gigabytes. Seven months into the Quasar upgrade, there was another upgrade to the Bitcoin SV network which was called the Genesis update: this update removed the block size limit altogether, making Bitcoin SV scalable to any possible size.\n\nHow have the Bitcoin Hard Forks Fared?\n\nA common motive for creating these forks is to introduce a supposedly more secure and scalable system that would overtake Bitcoin in adoption and popularity. So far, none of the Bitcoin forks has been able to topple Bitcoin and its dominance.\n\nSome of these Bitcoin forks have ended up becoming hard-forked as a result of carry-over debates among community members; even after becoming a fork the scalability debate still lingers in the communities of the fork-created blockchain, often leading to a further split.\n\nIn terms of developer activities, Bitcoin has a larger number of active developers compared to its hard-forked versions. Bitcoin has also greatly improved in scaling its network using layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network \u2013 a lightweight, fast, and scalable network built on top of Bitcoin \u2013 and upgrades like SegWit and Taproot.\n\nOf all the Bitcoin hard forks, Bitcoin Cash has managed to maintain relevance over the years. Its native coin BCH is still actively traded on major crypto exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.\n\nIn the latest development, Robinhood, in an email to customers, announced that it will end support for Bitcoin SV. Users have been given a deadline of January 25 to convert or sell their BSV. Robinhood said its decision is based on its regular review of the cryptocurrencies it offers on its platform. Similarly, BTG, the native coin of Bitcoin Gold, was delisted from Binance in October 2022. The delisting and end of support of these Bitcoin variants on major crypto platforms and exchanges clearly indicate their lack of adoption and use.\n\nBitcoin has, however, maintained its status as the undisputed crypto king over the years, gaining the attention of and investments from retail and institutional investors alike.\n\nTo learn more about Bitcoin, visit our Investing in Bitcoin guide."

Bitcoin, for one, stood around $16,500 on January 1. After a quiet first few days, it began to add value and broke above $17,000 earlier this week.\n\nHowever, that was just the start, as the asset kept breaking into forgotten ground in the following days and finally reached $20,000 late last night.\n\nIt continued climbing and jumped to $21,240 (on Bitstamp) for the first time since the FTX collapse unfolded at the beginning of November.\n\nSeveral altcoins have skyrocketed even more in the past 24 hours. Solana has stolen the show with a massive 40% rally, driving it to a multi-month high of its own at above $23.\n\nPolkadot (20%), Shiba Inu (14%), Ethereum (10.5%), Cardano (11%), Dogecoin (11%), Polygon (10%), and OKB (10%) are just some of the examples of double-digit price gainers.\n\nThis has resulted in the overall crypto market cap nearing $1 trillion for the first time in months on CoinMarketCap.\n\nShort traders have felt the pain of this impressive rally, according to CoinGlass. The total value of liquidated positions in the past day stands at $650 million, but $590 million are from shorts.\n\nMore than 110,000 traders have been wrecked in the same timeframe, with the largest single order happening on Huobi, which was worth over $6.5 million."

        "content": "What happened\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, companies and funds with direct ties to the crypto market are having a great week as the leading cryptocurrency finally had some good news to report. Here's how a handful of securities intimately related to Bitcoin (BTC 2.33%) fared this week, counting from Wall Street's closing bell at 4 p.m. ET last Friday to the corresponding bell time on Thursday, Jan. 12:\n\nFor those unfamiliar with these crypto-friendly securities, Marathon Digital (MARA -2.18%) and Riot Platforms (RIOT -1.36%) specialize in mining new Bitcoin tokens with renewable energy and ultra-specialized computer rigs. MicroStrategy (MSTR 7.35%) is a data analytics business that has converted essentially all of its cash reserves into Bitcoin, pouring more cash into the cryptocurrency through new debt, stock sales, and cash flows from the software business. Finally, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -1.01%) is neither a company nor a stock but a closed-end fund that holds nothing but Bitcoin on its balance sheet. These are four of the largest concentrated Bitcoin holdings on the planet.\n\nBitcoin itself gained 6.4% over the same period and continued climbing after Thursday's market close. By 8:30 p.m. ET, the oldest and largest crypto had gained 11.2% since Friday afternoon.\n\nSo what\n\nThere was a lot going on in crypto-land this week. Let's stick with a bird's-eye view of Bitcoin's action, as the others based their gains directly on that foundation.\n\nFriday morning's jobs and wage growth report was good but not fantastic, which was exactly what the Federal Reserve was hoping for. The dream scenario these days is a lukewarm economy, allowing the Fed to slow down the pace of interest rate increases. That was good news for high-risk investments, including Bitcoin and the securities mentioned above.\n\nBullish signs for the global economy continued to amass as the week progressed, supported by positive financial reports and cautiously optimistic comments from federal regulators. And then, Bitcoin went for a more obvious bull run on Thursday for several reasons. The morning's inflation report showed stabilizing trends. South Korean tech giant Samsung's Hong Kong-based asset management arm unveiled an upcoming exchange-traded fund based on Bitcoin futures. The government of El Salvador passed a complex new law to regulate cryptocurrency trading in the country, which adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender last year.\n\nThis flurry brought Bitcoin back to prices not seen since last November, passing $18,000 per coin and briefly peeking above the $19,000 level on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe fund and stocks mentioned above are extremely sensitive to Bitcoin's price moves, amplified by the additional risk these organizations are taking to take full advantage of the cryptocurrency's expected long-term price gains. Marathon, Riot, and MicroStrategy have significantly more debt than cash and may have to sell some Bitcoin from time to time just to keep the lights on.\n\nMany investors expect them to get crushed in periods of weak Bitcoin pricing, with short-selling interest ranging from 20% of all Riot shares to roughly 45% for Marathon and MicroStrategy. And Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holds 631,628 Bitcoins worth approximately $12.0 billion at today's crypto prices, but the fund's total market value is just $7.3 billion. So you can effectively get exposure to Bitcoin at a 40% discount through the Grayscale fund, as investors see more risk than promise in Grayscale's Bitcoin plans.\n\nNow what\n\nDon't get too excited by the Bitcoin stocks' massive weekly gains. They all still trade far below their 52-week highs and even deeper under the multi-year highs they set in November 2021. MicroStrategy, for example, trades stands 61% below its 52-week highs, and that's the mildest price cut on my list. Marathon and Riot shares are down more than 70% each.\n\nAgainst that background, this week's rosy news and surging market action serve as a reminder that these alternative Bitcoin investments come with larger portions of both promise and risk than the cryptocurrency itself. That's fine if you don't mind the elevated risk and volatility, but it also makes sense to see massive short-selling interest in these securities.\n\nIn other words, please tread carefully around these hyper-volatile investment options. Bitcoin miners and dedicated crypto investors can be explosive, both in the \"skyrocketing\" sense of that word and the plain old destructive meaning. As sobering as this thought may be when you remember Bitcoin's wild price swings in years past, buying Bitcoin directly looks like a lower-risk strategy."

        "content": "\n\n\n\nAlejandra Guajardo, an actress and model, represented El Salvador in the Miss Universe 2022 pageant, where she wore a costume that featured Bitcoin as she walked across the stage.\n\n\n\nOn January 12th, Alejandra Guajardo posted on her Instagram account and tagged Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, showing a photo of herself walking with a large col\u00f3n currency adorned with cocoa beans strapped to her back. She also carried a staff with a large physical Bitcoin on top of it in her hand.\n\nThe Miss Universe announcer stated that the costume worn by Guajardo represents El Salvador's history of currency. They explained that cocoa was used as a currency in the past, followed by the col\u00f3n, and eventually replaced by the US dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also mentioned that in 2021, El Salvador became the very first nation to use Bitcoin as legal tender and that the costume was a representation of that.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Miss Universe pageant, 16 contestants will move on to the semifinals after the preliminary competition. Eighty-four countries are represented in the 2022 event.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuajardo's walk across the stage in New Orleans came after El Salvador's legislature approved a bill that aims to establish a framework for Bitcoin-backed bonds. Pro-crypto lawmakers in the country have suggested using these bonds to pay off sovereign debt and finance the building of a Bitcoin City.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe costume worn by Guajardo was designed by plastic artist Francisco Guerrero, and it featured BTC at the front, possibly symbolising the future of currency in El Salvador.\n\nIt is uncertain if the government or President Nayib Bukele played a role in promoting the crypto to the global audience. Bukele has used his Twitter account to report several BTC purchases following El Salvador's adoption of the crypto asset as legal tender in September 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIn round five of the legal battle between the SEC and crypto investment firm Grayscale, the latter has slammed the Commission's previous brief, indicating that the regulator's \"central premise is illogical.\"\n\nToday's reply brief, first shared with Decrypt, responds to the SEC's December 9 brief and is part of ongoing litigation that Grayscale initiated in June 2022. The litigation began after the SEC denied the firm's attempts to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a coveted spot market Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe watchdog argued that the ETF application did not do enough to protect investors from \"fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,\" an argument that has appeared in nearly all of the SEC's Bitcoin ETF rejections.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, the Commission has already approved several futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting that this product does not fall prey to the same fraud and manipulation because \"the two products are not the same.\n\n\"Its central premise\u2014that the Exchange\u2019s surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME provides adequate protection against fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin futures market but not the spot bitcoin market\u2014is illogical,\" argued Grayscale in today's response brief.\n\nA surveillance-sharing agreement refers to an arrangement between an exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in which the CME oversees any instances of market manipulation that would artificially affect the price of an asset.\n\nGrayscale's response countered that any fraud occurring in the spot Bitcoin market \"would necessarily affect the price of Bitcoin futures.\"\n\n\"There is thus no reasonable basis for concluding that CME surveillance adequately protects holders of one kind of ETP [Exchange-Traded Product] but not the other,\" the response continues. \"Yet the Order rests on that very conclusion.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC will issue its final brief on the matter on February 3.\n\nGrayscale chases Bitcoin ETF conversion\n\nThough the market has been waiting for a spot Bitcoin ETF for several years, with Grayscale's litigation also earning the support of many in the industry, the asset manager's ailing GBTC product has piled on the pressure to secure approval for its conversion.\n\nGBTC lets investors gain exposure to Bitcoin without the need for to hold the asset itself. Of late, though, the Grayscale product is trading at a hefty discount to the underlying BTC it hopes to represent. According to Ycharts, the discount is currently 39.68% but has hit a low of 48.89%.\n\nThis discount has emerged due to recent market volatility as well as the inability to redeem the GBTC shares for actual Bitcoin. If the product was converted to a traditional ETF, this redemption process would be available and would likely erase the discount as arbitragers traded away the difference.\n\nThe firm is also facing pressure from investors for this discount. In December, hedge fund Fir Tree Capital filed a lawsuit against Grayscale over \"potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest\" relating to the widening gap between GBTC and Bitcoin.\n\nAnd while Grayscale takes on the SEC, its CEO Michael Sonnenshein has also floated a few ideas about how to address the discount should the Commission win the case. One such idea involves making a tender offer of 20% of the outstanding shares.\n\nThis too, though, would also need approval from the SEC to lift \"certain requirements\" pertaining to the execution of such an offer."

Primary support and resistance levels\n\nOur analysis of the weekly time frame revealed $40,000 to be the lowest probable support for BTC in 2024.\n\nto be the lowest probable support for BTC in 2024. As the king coin ascends, it might face its highest resistance around $69,000 to $70,000.\n\n2. Market sentiment\n\nIn March 2024, Bitcoin was overbought amid a highly bullish market.\n\n3. Predictive forecasts\n\nOur AI/ML predictive models forecast that Bitcoin will be traded at an average price of over $86,000 in 2025 and over $310,000 in 2035\n\nGiven below is a comprehensive weekly technical analysis of BTC, followed by coming days of the month, upcoming months, and yearly forecast tables derived from our AI/ML-based predictive models:\n\nBTC technical analysis: Record highs on the horizon\n\nIn 2023, BTC demonstrated a remarkable recovery from its lows in 2022, showcasing a year of significant volatility and growth. This year, the king coin is experiencing a massive bull run. Many analysts anticipate the Bitcoin price prediction for 2024 will be monumental as the price can achieve record-breaking levels.\n\nThe period under review started with a notable price surge in mid-March that allowed the cryptocurrency to surpass the resistance level at $25,000, subsequently claiming it as new support.\n\n\n\nThis upward momentum continued, with the price reaching the resistance at $30,000 in April. However, this led to a slight rejection, and the price retracted to its support. This pattern repeated in mid-June when the coin's retest of the resistance led to subsequent declines. By mid-July, the price started to drop, eventually falling back to $25,000 by mid-August.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until the end of October that BTC finally broke through this resistance. Continuing this rally, the price successfully claimed $40,000 as support by December. After this, the price consolidated between this support and the resistance at $45,000.\n\nIn February, BTC experienced a significant bullish breakout that saw the cryptocurrency surge through the $45,000 barrier for the first time since April 2022. As the month progressed, bullish momentum intensified, with the $52,000 resistance level vigorously tested by bulls.\n\nBy the end of February, this resistance was successfully converted into a support level, highlighting the strength of the rally. Concurrently, Bitcoin's market capitalization reclaimed the $1 trillion mark.\n\n\n\nThe uptrend carried into March, and Bitcoin hit $69,000 on March 5, surpassing its previous all-time high (ATH) on platforms like Bitstamp and Coinbase. However, a retracement occurred, with prices dropping as low as $61,000 by afternoon, as reported by CoinMarketCap. Despite this pullback, BTC managed to recover some ground, closing at $67,130 at the time of writing, marking an approximate increase of 1% over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe retracement marked a 15% decrease from peak to trough this week. This was the second significant drawdown since the exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch, with the earlier drawdown being 20%. While notable, this post-ETF decline was considered a necessary adjustment for Bitcoin's price to accelerate its growth.\n\nIn light of historical trends that forecast drawdowns exceeding 30% in previous cycles, the recent attainment of an ATH prior to the halving contradicts established norms. Moreover, with the Bitcoin supply anticipated to halve in under 50 days, there's a noticeable shift in the market dynamics.\n\n\n\nThe sentiment within the cryptocurrency industry is increasingly bullish, as a number of experts have begun to forecast significantly higher valuations for Bitcoin in the near future. These predictions suggest that Bitcoin could escalate to monumental price points of $100,000 to $150,000. This optimistic outlook hinges on Bitcoin's ability to push past a critical threshold of $69,000 to $70,000.\n\nDespite these bullish forecasts, the potential for a continued downtrend is scrutinized amidst concerns of an overvalued market. A correction or consolidation could see Bitcoin's value dropping to between $40,000 and $50,000. Such a scenario would likely be temporary, paving the way for Bitcoin to rebound and attain new heights.\n\nMarket dynamics are further complicated by the liquidation thresholds for long and short positions. Approximately $2.2 billion worth of long positions are at risk of liquidation if prices fall to $63,200. At the same time, $2.4 billion in short positions could be liquidated if the price rises to $70,000. These thresholds could either amplify selling pressure or trigger a short squeeze, potentially leading to significant price volatility.\n\nBased on the future predictions from our predictive models, BTC is forecasted to experience a significant increase in value. In the upcoming year, it is anticipated that the coin will trade at an average price exceeding $86,000. Looking ahead, the projections become even more striking.\n\n\n\nBy the year 2035, our models predict that the average price of Bitcoin will exceed $310,000. This long-term forecast highlights the expected continued growth and adoption of Bitcoin as a major digital asset in the financial landscape.\n\nBTC's 2024 roadmap: Key indicators to watch and trade"

        "content": "As cryptocurrency mining becomes an increasingly popular method of obtaining digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), one national park in eastern Congo has decided to put its natural resources to use in order to mine the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) token.\n\nSpecifically, the leadership of Virunga National Park, which was stricken by countless misfortunes over the years, leaving it in desperate need of funding to protect its forests and wildlife, has recognized Bitcoin mining as an ideal opportunity, as MIT Technology Review\u2019s Adam Popescu reported on January 13.\n\nSolution materializes\n\nAccording to the report, Africa\u2019s oldest protected park and home to endangered mountain gorillas was affected by years of militia violence and pillaging, deforestation, pandemic lockdowns, diseases, and meager government assistance, but the plan has been set in motion to use its hydroelectric power for mining Bitcoin in a bid to recover and thrive.\n\nAs the park\u2019s director, Emmanuel de Merode, explained:\n\n\u201cWe built the power plant and figured we\u2019d build the network gradually. (\u2026) Then, we had to shut down tourism in 2018 because of kidnappings [by rebels]. Then, in 2019, we had to shut down tourism because of Ebola. And 2020\u2014the rest is history with covid. For four years, all of our tourism revenue\u2014it used to be 40% of park revenue\u2014it collapsed. (\u2026) It\u2019s not something we expected, but we had to work out a solution.\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, De Merode and his colleagues landed on the idea of buying $200,000 in Bitcoin rigs which would be powered by the park\u2019s hydro-energy, providing the necessary profits, as well as a viable way to use this energy.\n\nWith the help of the crypto investor S\u00e9bastien Gouspillou, the park bought second-hand servers in early 2020 and got to building the world\u2019s first known Bitcoin mine operated by a national park and running on clean energy.\n\nThe mine uses the power provided by the Luviro hydro-station, which is one of the park\u2019s river-run hydro plants opened since 2013 (with a fourth one under construction), providing electricity for the Bitcoin mining operation with a low environmental impact \u2013 using the river\u2019s constant flow rather than obstructing it with dams and reservoirs.\n\nWill it work?\n\nDespite the occasional negative developments in the crypto sector, such as the FTX collapse, that have affected the price of Bitcoin, De Merode is optimistic, pointing out that each day of mining represents pure profit, no matter how much Bitcoin fluctuates in value.\n\nAccording to Michael Saylor, the co-founder of the investment firm MicroStrategy, Virunga\u2019s model is \u201cthe ideal high-tech industry to put in a nation that has plenty of clean energy but isn\u2019t able to export a product or produce a service with that energy.\u201d\n\nPeter Wall, the CEO of Argo Blockchain, which runs hydro-powered mines in Quebec, believes that the Virunga mine could, indeed, be profitable as it has all three things that are ultimately necessary to mine Bitcoin: \u201cpower, machines, capital.\u201d\n\nFinally, De Merode has said that this was \u201can incredibly good investment for the park,\u201d as \u201cwe\u2019re not speculating on its value; we\u2019re generating it,\u201d adding that the park was \u201cmaking Bitcoin out of surplus energy and monetizing something that otherwise has no value.\u201d"

In Bankman-Fried\u2019s view, a run on the bank turned illiquidity issues into insolvency. Among the latest developments in the bankruptcy proceedings, a bipartisan group of United States senators criticized one of the law firms involved in the case on the grounds of a conflict of interest, and called on the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to appoint an independent examiner into FTX\u2019s activities. Also in the week\u2019s headlines, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich said the company has recovered $5 billion in cash and liquid cryptocurrencies.\n\nGemini and Genesis charged by SEC with selling unregistered securities\n\nCrypto firms Genesis Global Capital and Gemini were charged by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with offering unregistered securities through Gemini\u2019s Earn program. Genesis and Gemini partnered on the product in 2020, offering customers the chance to loan crypto with the promise of later repayment with interest. The SEC stated that the Gemini Earn program constitutes an offer and sale of securities, and should have been registered with the commission. Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said the SEC\u2019s action was \u201ctotally counterproductive,\u201d and noted that Gemini had been discussing the Earn program with the regulator \u201cfor more than 17 months.\u201d.\n\nDCG owes creditors over $3B, considering $500M VC portfolio sale\n\nIt has been a difficult week for Genesis Global Trading and its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), as reports revealed that Genesis allegedly owes its creditors more than $3 billion. To offset the shortfall, DCG, which also owns Grayscale Investments, seeks to sell part of its venture capital holdings with more than 200 crypto-related projects, including crypto exchanges, banks and custodians in at least 35 countries, totaling around $500 million in valuation.\n\nEl Salvador passes landmark crypto bill, paving way for Bitcoin-backed bonds\n\nOn Jan. 11, El Salvador passed the landmark Digital Assets Issuance law that establishes the legal framework to issue Bitcoin-backed bonds to pay down sovereign debt and fund the construction of a so-called \u201cBitcoin City.\u201d The bonds are expected to raise $1 billion for the country, half of which will be used to build the special economic zone. The legislation also creates a regulatory body and establishes a legal framework for all digital assets in the country.\n\nAbu Dhabi-based Venom Foundation launches $1B fund for Web3 and blockchain\n\nVenom Foundation, an Abu Dhabi-based blockchain platform, and Iceberg Capital announced a new partnership that will allocate $1 billion to Web3 and blockchain companies, including decentralized applications focused on payments, asset management, decentralized finance and GameFi products and services. The investment fund will look to attract startups and technology firms to use Venom\u2019s proof-of-stake-based blockchain solution.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $19,297, Ether (ETH) at $1,418 and XRP at $0.37. The total market cap is at $916.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAmong the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Gala (GALA) at 125.9%, Aptos (APT) at 77.52% and Optimism (OP) at 45.28%.\n\nThe top three altcoin losers of the week are Fei USD (FEI) at -2.53%, Nexo (NEXO) at -2.29% and UNUS SED LEO (LEO) at 0.07%.\n\n\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s market analysis.\n\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\n\u201cThere are still some overhangs \u2014 DCG and Genesis and Gemini \u2014 that will play out in the next quarter. That\u2019s not going to be great.\u201d\n\nMike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings\n\n\u201cHistory tells us there\u2019s not much room for micro currencies, meaning, you know, we have the U.S. dollar and Europe has the euro and the like.\u201d\n\nGary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n\n\u201cAs long as there is interest in the crypto market, the number of hackers will not decrease.\u201d\n\nTommy Deng, managing director of Beosin\n\n\u201cPeople talk about the [Bitcoin] problem of volatility, but this is nothing when you live in a place where your money could easily lose half its value in a year.\u201d\n\nMegasley, Nigeria\u2019s first Lightning node runner\n\n\u201cThere is no path forward as long as Barry Silbert remains CEO of DCG.\u201d\n\nCameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a political act and not a financial gesture. Like those who grow mustaches in November to fight prostate cancer. I put this salary in Bitcoin on a cold wallet every month and I haven\u2019t touched it.\u201d\n\nChristophe De Beukelaer, Belgian lawmaker\n\nPrediction of the Week\n\nBitcoin price wants to retest 2017 all-time high near $20K\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has jumped in recent days and sits near $19,000 at the end of this week, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\n\n\nOn-chain analytics resource Material Indicators predicts there could be a retest of the $20,000 mark. \u201cSeems like BTC is setting up for a retest of resistance at the 2017 Top,\u201d it wrote on Twitter.\n\nAccording to the analytics firm, \u201cwhether we see a bonafide breakout or fakeout remains to be seen. Time for patience and discipline.\u201d\n\nFUD of the Week\n\nNexo offices reportedly raided by police in Bulgaria\n\nBulgarian regulators are increasing pressure on cryptocurrency lender Nexo, after a group of prosecutors, investigators and foreign agents searched the company\u2019s offices in the Bulgarian capital city of Sofia on Jan. 12. The operation was initiated a few months ago, targeting a large-scale financial criminal scheme allegedly involving money laundering and violations of international sanctions against Russia. Nexo has complained about the actions of the law enforcement authorities and is preparing to file a lawsuit against authorities to seek compensation for damages caused by the abrupt police interruption.\n\nScam alert: MetaMask warns crypto users about address poisoning\n\nDigital wallet provider MetaMask warned users of an \u201caddress poisoning scam,\u201d where attackers \u201cpoison\u201d transaction histories. The attack does not allow hackers to access user\u2019s wallets, but those who have become habitual about copying their wallet addresses from transaction histories could potentially send funds to copycat addresses.\n\nCrypto.\u200bcom CEO announces 20% staff cut, \u2018did not account\u2019 for FTX collapse\n\nA new wave of staff layoffs has been announced by crypto exchange Crypto.com, which will reduce its global workforce by 20% following \u201crecent industry events.\u201d Also fighting to survive the bear market, Coinbase is closing most of its Japanese operations as part of a restructuring plan that aims to reduce 20% of the exchange staff..\n\nBest Cointelegraph Features\n\n\u2018Deflation\u2019 is a dumb way to approach tokenomics\u2026 and other sacred cows\n\nNovelty token designs might attract some brief interest, but projects need to learn the principles of sustainable tokenomics..\n\nYour guide to crypto in Toronto: Crypto City\n\nThe \u201chome\u201d of Ethereum and the home town of Vitalik Buterin, Toronto embraced digital assets sooner than most and is home to more crypto projects than anywhere else in Canada.\n\nCrypto layoffs mount as exchanges continue to be ravaged by the prevailing bear market\n\nMany popular cryptocurrency trading platforms, including Kraken and Coinbase, have recently initiated a fresh round of firings."

        "title": "ChatGPT Answers Crypto\u2019s Biggest Questions: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "The internet has become quickly fascinated by ChatGPT \u2013 the language model chatbot that seems to effortlessly provide long-form answers to any question.\n\nCrypto Twitter seems especially fascinated with the AI bot \u2013 from Casa founder Jameson Lopp to Twitter\u2019s new chief and Dogecoin enthusiast, Elon Musk.\n\nWe decided to ask ChatGPT a number of questions related to Bitcoin and crypto adoption \u2013 including those that are still hotly debated by humans. Here\u2019s what the infamous bot had to say.\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum?\n\nWe first asked what ChatGPT thought about Bitcoin: \u201cDoes Bitcoin have intrinsic value?\u201d\n\nMany of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest critics, such as gold bug Peter Schiff, would say no, arguing that the asset is purely speculative and destined to crash to zero. Yet the AI bot\u2019s answer was a bit more nuanced:\n\n\u201cSome people might argue that Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature and its ability to function as a digital store of value could be considered as intrinsic value,\u201d it stated.\n\nIts answer captures the view shared by some of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest proponents that the asset can become the \u201cdigital gold\u201d of the 21st century, thanks to its unmanipulable monetary policy.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what ChatGPT pointed out afterward when asked to compare Bitcoin to Ethereum. \u201cIt\u2019s often referred to as digital gold,\u201d it stated. \u201cIts primary use case is as a digital alternative to traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or the Euro.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, it described Ether as having \u201cmore potential for innovation than Bitcoin,\u201d thus making it more attractive to developers. As explained by BitMEX in July, Ethereum\u2019s scripting language and culture have historically been more welcoming to change than Bitcoin\u2019s \u2013 though more dapps are starting to develop on the Bitcoin lightning network.\n\nWho is Satoshi?\n\nChatGPT isn\u2019t all-knowing, however: it admitted that the identity of Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator \u2013 Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 \u201chas not been revealed and is not publicly known.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile some individuals have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto or have been suspected of being the creator, none of these claims have been independently verified,\u201d it said. Bitcoin SV founder Craig Wright has often accused others of defaming him when he claims to be the enigmatic founder \u2013 but he\u2019s yet to see much recent success in court.\n\nWhen asked if Bitcoin would ever become the world reserve currency, the bot didn\u2019t rule out the possibility. While it still lacks the \u201cinfrastructure, regulations, and stability,\u201d to be considered as such, it is still \u201cpossible that the future may bring changes to this situation\u201d as the technology grows and develops.\n\nFinally, ChatGPT is not a total nocoiner.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency and blockchain technology are not a scam,\u201d it said when asked \u201cIs crypto a scam?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut like any other financial market, there are risks and frauds to be aware of,\u201d it clarified."

        "title": "Here's how to quickly spot a deepfake crypto scam \u2014 cybersecurity execs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto investors have been urged to keep their eyes peeled for \u201cdeepfake\u201d crypto scams to come, with the digital-doppelganger technology continuing to advance, making it harder for viewers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nDavid Schwed, the chief operating officer of blockchain security firm Halborn, told Cointelegraph that the crypto industry is more \u201csusceptible\u201d to deepfakes than ever because \u201ctime is of the essence in making decisions,\u201d which results in less time to verify the veracity of a video.\n\nDeepfakes use deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) to create highly realistic digital content by manipulating and altering original media, such as swapping faces in videos, photos, and audio, according to OpenZeppelin technical writer Vlad Estoup.\n\nEstoup noted that crypto scammers often use deepfake technology to creat fake videos of well-known personalities to execute scams.\n\nAn example of such a scam was a deepfake video of FTX\u2019s former CEO in November, where scammers used old interview footage of Sam Bankman-Fried and a voice emulator to direct users to a malicious website promising to \u201cdouble your cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, a verified account posing as FTX founder SBF posted dozens of copies of this deepfake video offering FTX users \"compensation for the loss\" in a phishing scam designed to drain their crypto wallets pic.twitter.com/3KoAPRJsya \u2014 Jason Koebler (@jason_koebler) November 21, 2022\n\nSchwed said that the volatile nature of crypto causes people to panic and take a \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d approach, which can lead to them getting suckered into deepfake scams. He noted:\n\n\u201cIf a video of CZ is released claiming withdrawals will be halted within the hour, are you going to immediately withdraw your funds, or spend hours trying to figure out if the message is real?\u201d\n\nHowever, Estoup believes that while deepfake technology is advancing at a rapid rate, it\u2019s not yet \u201cindistinguishable from reality.\u201d\n\nHow to spot a deepfake: Watch the eyes\n\nSchwed suggests one useful way to quickly spot a deepfake is to watch when the subject blinks their eyes. If it looks unnatural, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a deepfake.\n\nThis is due to the fact that deepfakes are generated using image files sourced on the internet, where the subject will usually have their eyes open, explains Schwed. Thus, in a deepfake, the blinking of the subject\u2019s eyes needs to be simulated.\n\nHey @elonmusk & @TuckerCarlson have you seen, what I assume is #deepfake paid ad featuring both of you? @YouTube how is this allowed? This is getting out of hand, its not #FreeSpeech it\u2019s straight #fraud: Musk Reveals Why He Financial Supports To Canadians https://t.co/IgoTbbl4fL pic.twitter.com/PRMfiyG3Pe \u2014 Matt Dupuis (@MatthewDupuis) January 4, 2023\n\nSchwed said the best identifier of course is to ask questions that only the real individual can answer, such as \u201cwhat restaurant did we meet at for lunch last week?\u201d\n\nEstoup said there is also AI software available that can detect deepfakes and suggests one should look out for big technological improvements in this area.\n\nHe also gave some age-old advice: \u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Yikes!\u2019 Elon Musk warns users against latest deepfake crypto scam\n\nLast year, Binance\u2019s chief communications officer, Patrick Hillman, revealed in an August blog post that a sophisticated scam was perpetrated using a deepfake of him.\n\nHillman noted that the team used previous news interviews and TV appearances over the years to create the deepfake and \u201cfool several highly intelligent crypto members.\u201d\n\nHe only became aware of this when he started to receive online messages thanking him for his time talking to project teams about potentially listing their assets on Binance.com.\n\nEarlier this week, blockchain security firm SlowMist noted there were 303 blockchain security incidents in 2022, with 31.6% of them caused by phishing, rug pulls and other scams."

        "content": "The crypto market rallied significantly in the last 24 hours.\n\nShort traders have seen the most liquidation.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew by over 5%, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nFor the first time post-FTX collapse, Bitcoin [BTC] traded above the $21,000 price mark, while leading altcoin Ethereum [ETH] changed hands at $1,600, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nAlso, sharing a statistically significant positive correlation with BTC, layer one coin Cardano [ADA] and leading meme coin Shiba Inu [SHIB] also logged price jumps of 4% and 6%, respectively, within the same time frame.\n\nAccording to data from the crypto analytics platform Coinglass, liquidations across the cryptocurrency market in the last 24 hours totaled $719.05 million, with 131,575 traders liquidated.\n\nHowever, the recent rally has had a particularly negative impact on short traders. In the last 24 hours, liquidated short positions represented 62% of total market liquidations, data from Coinglass showed.\n\nWhy the greens?\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that the crypto and traditional finance markets share a close correlation. The recent rally in the crypto market could be attributable to the fact that all major indexes closed the just-concluded trading week on a positive note for the first time since November.\n\nOn 13 January, after starting the day by booking significant losses, all major indexes managed to recover and close in the green. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 0.33%. The S&P 500 also rose by 0.40% to 3,999.09, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.71% to reach 11,079.16.\n\nAccording to CNBC, the recent rally resulted in the S&P and Nasdaq both having their second consecutive positive week and best weekly performance since November. The Nasdaq had the highest weekly increase at 4.82%. The S&P and Dow also saw gains of 2.67% and 2%, respectively.\n\nA bull trap or nay?\n\nA pseudonymous crypto analyst on Twitter CryptoCapo opined that while the market might have logged unprecedented gains in the last 24 hours, the possibility of registering new lows was not completely invalidated.\n\nGood morning.

Is the downward trend anticipated to continue, and if so, why?\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BSVs worth today?\n\nRobinhood halt BSV trade, delisting on the way\n\nBitcoin SV\u2019s price has been on a downward trend, as depicted by a chart with a daily time frame. It\u2019s possible that the prevailing sentiment on the market played a role, but more investigation suggests additional elements at play.\n\nStock and cryptocurrency trading platform Robinhood said on 11 January that it would soon stop supporting Bitcoin SV and delist the token later in the month.\n\nAccording to the latest Robinhood announcement, as of 25 January, customers can no longer trade, purchase, or otherwise deal with Bitcoin SV. After that time, all unsold BSV in client accounts will be sold and credited to their accounts automatically.\n\nA fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) resulted in Bitcoin SV, often known as \u201cSatoshi\u2019s Vision.\u201d Its greater block size, which leads to lower transaction costs, sets it apart from other variants of Bitcoin [BTC], such as Bitcoin Cash [BCH].\n\nSelling pressure spikes volume metric\n\nAs per Santiment\u2019s volume metric, on 11 January, there was a significant increase in the number of transactions. The graph below revealed that over $77 million was traded over that timeframe. This was the first time in the year that such a high number of transactions would be documented, making it particularly noteworthy.\n\nLooking at the volume indicator on the price chart in more detail, selling pressure had been predominant in the volume of transactions. BSV\u2019s value fell as selling pressure became more prevalent.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

The asset was trading at around $41.4 at the time of writing, having lost about 1%."

        "title": "How To Buy Bitcoin (BTC) with JazzCash - OKX",
        "content": "JazzCash is a mobile financial services provider in Pakistan that offers its customers a wide range of financial services. It is a joint venture between Mobilink Microfinance Bank and Jazz \u2014 Pakistan's leading mobile network operator. The service was launched in 2012 and has since grown rapidly in popularity.

        "title": "Bitcoin adoption 2023: updated data - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "The purpose of this article is to analyze the level of Bitcoin adoption in early 2023, after a year of turmoil during which Bitcoin\u2019s price reached its lowest levels in two years.\n\nIn order to analyze the current level of Bitcoin adoption, we will consider the six metrics listed below:\n\nusers of major exchanges\n\nusers of major wallets\n\nbusinesses that accept Bitcoin\n\nhash rates\n\ndaily transactions\n\nglobal crypto adoption index\n\nFinally, we will look at the main opportunities that could positively impact Bitcoin adoption during 2023 and the years to come.\n\nUsers of major exchanges\n\nIn this chapter, we will analyze the growth of the user base of major crypto exchanges during 2022. This metric is important for assessing Bitcoin adoption levels since, for most users, the first step in entering the cryptocurrency world is to purchase an initial amount on an online exchange platform.\n\nMajor exchanges internationally have just released their year-end reports, which include updated information on the growth of their user base. We report below, for each exchange considered, the respective user base at the end of 2021 and at the end of 2022, as well as the growth rate for the year considered:\n\nCoinbase\n\nIn December 2021 it had 73 million verified users. Over the next twelve months, its user base grew by 48% to 108 million. To date, Coinbase represents the second largest crypto exchange in the world after Binance in terms of number of users. In terms of trading volume, Coinbase ranks fourth in the world with as much as \u20ac2 billion in daily trades.\n\nBinance\n\nIn its latest year-end letter, Binance\u2018s CEO revealed that by 2022 the platform had reached 120 million users (thus quadrupling its user base compared to 2021). With more than 19 billion in daily trades, today Binance represents the platform with the largest trading volume in the world.\n\nCrypto.com\n\nFrom February 2021 to December 2022, Crypto.com\u2019s user base grew 7-fold to 70 million individuals (20 million of which were gained between May 2022 and December 2022 alone). This platform, originally from Singapore, was only launched in 2019 and is already the 40th largest exchange in the world by trading volume (\u20ac370 million in daily trades).\n\nKuCoin\n\nFrom December 2021 to December 2022, the number of KuCoin users nearly tripled, growing from 10 million to 27 million. With 660 million euros of daily trading, KuCoin represents the 27th largest exchange in the world by trading volume to date. It was founded in 2017 by Michael Gan and Eric Don and today offers the ability to buy and sell over 700 cryptocurrencies in more than 200 countries around the world.\n\nBitget\n\nFrom March 2022 to January 2023, Bitget\u2019s user base quadrupled, growing from 2 million to 8 million. Bitget\u2019s growth is due in large part to the company\u2019s ability to forge strategic partnerships with major sports personalities, including Leo Messi.\n\nFounded in 2018, today Bitget represents the 29th largest exchange in the world by trading volume (more than 605 million in daily trades). It operates in 50 countries around the world and boasts a team of more than 600 professionals.\n\nUsers of major wallets\n\nMore than 100 million mobile wallets were downloaded between January and October 2022. This figure testifies to a drop in downloads of more than 40% compared to data from 2021, a period of full bull run when the number of wallets downloaded exceeded 177 million. However, it is important to mention that this record figure corresponds to the highest level of annual downloads ever recorded and that at the time of writing we are at a level three times higher than the pre-bull run period of 2020:\n\nOn the other hand, the following graph shows the downloads of one of the largest wallets, Blockchain.com, and shows us how these have increased over the past 12 months (although growth has slowed down quite a bit from October 2022 to the present):\n\nIn particular, the number of Blockchain.com wallet users has increased by 6% over the past year, exceeding 85 million (cumulative downloads from 2011 to the present).\n\nBusinesses that accept Bitcoin\n\nEven though during 2022 the price of Bitcoin reached its lowest value in 2 years, the adoption of cryptocurrency among merchants has grown. Evidence of this can be found in data from coinmap.org, which reports a 7% increase in the number of merchant establishments accepting Bitcoin between January 2022 and January 2023:\n\nThe table below orders in descending order the Italian cities with the largest number of businesses accepting Bitcoin as a payment method in 2023:\n\nCity Number of places that accept Bitcoin Milano 111 Roma 104 Trieste 53 Rovereto 50 Verona 37 Venezia 32 Bologna 30 Cagliari 23 Firenze 23 Genova 23 Trento 22 Torino 22 Padova 21 Palermo 20 Napoli 19 Reggio Emilia 19 Perugia 15 San Marino 15 Pisa 11 Pescara 8 Bari 7\n\nThe following, on the other hand, is a chart sorting Italian cities by the number of Bitcoin ATMs they have (updated as of September 2022):\n\nHash Rate\n\nThe Bitcoin hash rate also grew during 2022 and shows a clear upward trend:\n\nThe importance of considering hash rate as a broad adoption metric stems from the fact that its value is positively correlated with the difficulty of the network and the number and size of miners. Simply put, the arrival of new operators in the mining industry leads to an increase in difficulty and thus in hash rate. As we see in the graph above, Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate in 2023 is at a higher level than the bull run of 2020-2021, despite the fact that the price of the asset has collapsed.\n\nDaily transactions\n\nThe number of daily transactions, an indicative measure of Bitcoin usage, continues to hover between 200,000 and 300,000 since January 2022. However, if we look at a broader time horizon, we note how this metric has been going through a downtrend since January 2018:\n\nThis downtrend seems to have stopped in the last 12 months, a period in which the value of this metric has consolidated in the 200,000 to 300,000 range.\n\nGlobal Crypto Adoption Index\n\nOn 14 September 2022, Chainalysis shared a report on cryptocurrency adoption that ranks countries based on grassroots adoption. Grassroots adoption measures \u201cin which countries people invest most of their money in crypto.\u201d The result of research by Chainalysis shows that emerging countries have the highest level of adoption. In fact, of the 20 countries considered:\n\nTen fall into the lower middle-income category: Vietnam, Philippines, Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Morocco, Nepal, Kenya, and Indonesia;\n\nEight are upper-middle income: Brazil, Thailand, Russia, China, Turkey, Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador;\n\nTwo belong to the high-income category: the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nItaly unfortunately still has a low level of adoption and is not included in the ranking of the 20 countries considered, which also excludes all other states belonging to the European Union.\n\nOpportunities for adoption in 2023\n\nDuring 2022, several countries around the world took major steps toward greater adoption of Bitcoin and decentralized technologies. Major events include El Salvador\u2019s new bill to launch Bitcoin Bonds, the adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency by the Central African Republic, the collaboration between Tether and Lugano under the Lugano Plan B initiative, and finally the birth of Bitcoin Island in the Philippines. Let\u2019s see them in detail below:\n\nLugano Plan B\n\nThe Plan B Forum, an event sponsored by Tether Operations Limited and the City of Lugano in order to facilitate the adoption of Bitcoin in Switzerland\u2019s most populated city, was held in Lugano on 28 October 2022. Thanks to the partnership with Tether, the City of Lugano can already boast thirty businesses that accept Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nHowever, Lugano\u2019s Plan B has even more ambitious goals: to extend the use of Bitcoin to the payment of taxes and to transform Lugano into a crypto-friendly city. The mayor of Lugano stated in this regard that: \u201cthe Swiss law itself already facilitates the use of this tool, we want to extend the use as much as possible and make the city a place where blockchain-related professionalism and startups are born.\u201d\n\nThe initiative of the City of Lugano thus represents a great opportunity to promote the adoption of Bitcoin on the European continent, starting right from one of the world\u2019s leading financial centers.\n\nAfrica\n\nIn the Global Crypto Adoption Index ranking that we have seen in the previous paragraphs, three African states appear among the top twenty: Nigeria, Morocco and Kenya. In addition, On 27 April 2022, the Central African Republic followed in El Salvador\u2019s footsteps, establishing itself as the second country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as its official currency.\n\nOn the Fourth of July, it also launched its CBDC (Sango Coin). The high prevalence of Bitcoin in Africa is likely due to the high inflation rates that characterize the economies of most countries on the continent and the dependence on foreign remittances.\n\nTo make matters worse, Africa has the largest concentration of individuals without bank accounts.\n\nBitcoin Island (Philippines)\n\nBoracay is a small island in the Philippines with a population of less than 20,000. However, it is frequented each year by thousands of tourists attracted by its beaches. The company behind the wallet, Pouch, has implemented an extensive evangelization campaign on the island and converted more than 100 local businesses that now accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.\n\nThe reason Pouch chose to focus on the Philippines is due to the country\u2019s rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies. As we saw in the chapter devoted to the Global Crypto Adoption Index, the Philippines is in fact the second largest crypto adoption country in the world, second only to Vietnam.\n\nBitcoin City (El Salvador)\n\nOn 17 November 2022, the Minister of Economy of El Salvador presented a new bill confirming the government\u2019s plan to raise $1 billion for the construction of \u201cBitcoin City.\u201d This bill calls on lawmakers to create a clear legislative framework for the use of digital assets in public issues in the country of El Salvador.\n\n\u201cBitcoin bonds,\u201d the tools that will be used to raise financing, had been introduced by Bukele as early as 2021. During 2022, however, the project was continuously postponed. In fact, the launch was scheduled for March 2022, and it was then delayed to September and then to a date to be determined. According to Bukele\u2019s statement, the delay was caused by the fact that the government had to prioritize pension reform.\n\nIn any case, when the Vulcan Bonds are finally launched, they will represent the first example of bonds issued on blockchain. The hope is that this can finally become a reality in 2023, and inspire other states to adopt decentralized finance.\n\nConclusions\n\nAlthough Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted during 2022, its fundamentals still appear solid. In particular, the number of users of major exchanges has increased at a very fast pace over the past 12 months, and some platforms have seen their user bases increase by 300% to 400%. The number of downloads of Bitcoin wallets in 2022 was 100 million, down 40% from 2021 but up 300% from 2020.\n\nIn contrast, the number of businesses accepting Bitcoin worldwide increased by 7% in 2022, and today we count more than 30,400 businesses. The hash rate shows a clear upward trend and the number of daily transactions has been moving within the 200 to 300 thousand range for a good 12 months.\n\nEmerging countries boast the highest crypto adoption today, and no EU country ranks in Chainalysis\u2019 Global Crypto Adoption Index."

        "title": "Only 0.5% of global population owns Bitcoin, representing every 184th person - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing a consistent winning streak that has emerged for the first time since the 2020 pandemic period with attempts to exit the bear market. As Bitcoin pushes to establish a solid rally, the latest data indicates that the number of individuals likely holding the token is also rising.\n\nIn this line, data acquired by Finbold indicates that as of January 13, the total number of Bitcoin unique holders stood at 43,540,424, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin seven-day unique holders chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe number of current Bitcoin holders represents a share of about 0.54% of the global population of 8,010,885,391 at the time of publishing, as per Worldometer data. Therefore, it can be deduced that every 184th person globally potentially owns some Bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, a previous Finbold report in August 2022 pointed out that at the time, every 226th person globally owned Bitcoin valued between $1 and $99.99. However, it is essential to note that in some instances (as in our previous report), a single individual can own several Bitcoin addresses.\n\nBitcoin ownership and the bear market\n\nBitcoin is currently making inroads to exit the bear market after weeks of sideways trading. In 2022, the asset dropped to record lows, a zone that potentially attracted new investors buying in the dip. In most cases, a price drop presents an opportunity for investors who believe in the maiden cryptocurrency\u2019s future to accumulate as the fear of missing out (FOMO) kicks in.\n\nIn recent years Bitcoin\u2019s adoption has been aided by developing countries where the asset offers tangible benefits, such as a possible solution for devalued local currencies. The countries are dominated by significant inflation, with Bitcoin standing out as a likely hedge.\n\nFor instance, with Bitcoin operating in an environment of high inflation and devaluation of most global currencies, BTC recorded an influx of investors who viewed the asset as a hedge to profit from arbitrage alongside being used for efficient transactions, wealth preservation, e-commerce, and remittances. Indeed, crypto proponents maintain these factors are likely to aid the asset\u2019s adoption.\n\nNotably, the increasing number of Bitcoin holders highlights the state of the maiden cryptocurrency\u2019s adoption curve. In this line, the holder changes indicate Bitcoin\u2019s progress towards the much sought mainstream adoption.\n\nThe potential of Bitcoin is further highlighted by a previous Finbold report indicating that the asset\u2019s blockchain accounted for over $8 trillion in transactions across 2022 despite the depressed markets.\n\nAlthough there is progress in Bitcoin ownership, the trajectory still faces several obstacles along the way, impacting investor confidence. Indeed, with the crypto market still facing uncertainty in terms of volatility, potential investors will likely remain on the fence. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny remains a significant barrier to fully adopting the asset.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin is now targeting the $20,000 position after breaching key support levels. By press time, BTC was trading at $19,956 with daily gains of over 6%. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is up 18%.\n\nElsewhere, the gains have come as Bitcoin records increased buying pressure translating to a market cap of $383.93 billion.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "$1 invested in Bitcoin 10 year ago would have earned you this much by now - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "When compared to its current worth, the price of a single Bitcoin (BTC) coin was just $13.30 in 2013. This is in stark contrast to the flagship digital asset current value.\n\nMany investors are kicking themselves for not having put money into Bitcoin in its \u201cearly days,\u201d wondering how much money even just $1 put into Bitcoin back then would be worth now.\n\nAccording to data calculated by Finbold, investors who bought $1 worth of Bitcoin in January 2013 when the digital asset was trading at $13.30 would have seen their investment grow to be worth $1,417 as of January 13, when the price of one BTC was $18,881.\n\nBitcoin price January 2013. Source: In2013dollars\n\nNotably, this is enough to buy one whole Ethereum (ETH) token at the decentralized finance (DeFi) assets current price of $1,407. However, investors from January 2013 would have seen the largest return on investment in November 2021 when BTC was trading at an all time high above $69,000.\n\n$1 in Bitcoin\n\nInterestingly, Finbold reported in August last year every 226th person on the planet owned at least $1 in Bitcoin. Data indicated that as of August 26, roughly 35,257,206 addresses are holding at least $1 worth of Bitcoin, according to BitInfoCharts.com statistics.\n\nThis equated to about 0.4% of the global population, meaning that every 226th person globally potentially owned at least $1 in Bitcoin based on the global population of 7,970,114,580 at the time.\n\nAs of the 13 of January, there are 100,000 fewer holders of $1 worth of Bitcoin, bringing the total number of holders to 35,136,414. However, it is worth mentioning that in some cases, one individual might own more than one Bitcoin address. For instance, an investor can have an address to more than one crypto wallet.\n\nSupport for BTC\n\nNotably, supporters of cryptocurrencies are advocating for widespread use of cryptocurrencies, noting Bitcoin\u2019s multiple benefits over traditional fiat currencies. These advantages include the convenience of Bitcoin\u2019s transactions, as well as its lower fees and quicker transfer times. However, there is still a lot of work to be done before the asset is used everywhere.\n\nIt is reasonable to infer that the people holding $1 are retail investors, as they make up the vast majority of the cryptocurrency market. Notably, the surge of retail investors is being pushed in part by the fear of missing out (FOMO), in addition to efforts to test the waters with cryptocurrency trading.\n\nOn the other hand, while a single Bitcoin unit is relatively costly, holding only one dollar\u2019s worth of the asset is, as a result, within the financial means of the vast majority of people whether that be today or back in 2013."

        "content": "Bitcoin has recently seen a significant price increase, breaking out from a period of relative consolidation. While this sudden jump in value may be exciting for investors, it\u2019s important to remember that the highly volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market means that caution should be exercised when making investment decisions.\n\nCan investors trust his pump or is it a bull trap? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nPrevious Bitcoin Analysis\n\nBTC/USD Chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nLast week\u2019s analysis brought us to a rather gloomy conclusion \u2013 Bitcoin was headed down. However, the asset has done a complete 180-degree turn and is headed up. There were two possible outcomes from last week\u2019s analysis:\n\nA bearish flag which would break downwards\n\nA double bottom that would signify a trend reversal\n\nBitcoin chose to go with the latter.\n\nCurrent Analysis\n\nThe asset rallied massively out of the blue pushing past $18500 and setting new local highs. The asset had previously tried breaking the $18,350 resistance (thick straight line) before but failed. Additionally, the asset broke out of the three-month descending triangle (trendline) presenting a major bullish signal.\n\nBTC/USD Chart. Source: Tradingview\n\nCan This Pump Be Trusted?\n\nNo.\n\nThe whole instapump reeks of price manipulation from smart money. In a time when major crypto companies are filing for bankruptcy, it is highly suspicious that Bitcoin price decides to move up.\n\nLet us not forget the liquidity hunt zones. If this rally is a run on liquidity, then the liquidations will be of epic proportions. Smart money needs to collect all the liquidity on the buy side before crashing the price. This could be the last rally before the megadump to $8,000.\n\nInvestors should be cautious of this move. Billionaires are calling a crypto crash at the end of January. While the information is not verified, they could have some insider information since they are also smart money.\n\nA wise man will heed the warning and prepares accordingly. It might seem insane, calling bear moves while the market is green but the best traders SELL GREEN and BUY GREEN. The situation on the Barry Silbert is still developing and it might be the catalyst that finally plunges the markets into chaos.\n\nBrace yourselves.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The work included in this article is based on current events, technical charts, company news releases, and the author\u2019s opinions.
