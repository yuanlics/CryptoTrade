        "title": "Solo Bitcoin Miner Solves Block With Hash Rate of Just 10 TH/s, Beating Extremely Unlikely Odds - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A solo Bitcoin miner with an average hashing power of just 10 TH/s (terahashes per second) won the race to add block 772,793 to the Bitcoin blockchain on Friday.\n\nAt the time the block was added, Bitcoin's total hash rate was just over 269 exahash per second, meaning the solo miner's 10 TH/s hash rate represented just 0.000000037% of the blockchain's entire computational power.\n\nPut simply: It was an extremely unlikely win for an individual miner.\n\nCongratulations to miner 1CEmkQkgiCMx6DHSDkHi53mL8oEthCZSw with only 10TH who solved a solo block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc ! https://t.co/0O7A7KR4eu \u2014 Dr. Con Kolivas (@ckpooldev) January 20, 2023\n\nDespite the odds stacked against them, the solo miner was the first to produce a valid hash for the block to be mined. In return, the miner received 98% of the total 6.35939231 BTC allotted for the block reward and fees. The remaining 2% went to Solo CK Pool, an online mining service that facilitates individual mining.\n\nBitcoin's randomness and probabilities coded for luck and work\n\nTo add a block to a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin, the miner must be the first to calculate a valid hash for the block, which can only be discovered using brute computational force.\n\nMining machines run an encryption algorithm to produce a hash that falls below a threshold specified by the network. If the algorithm produces a value that is above the hash target, the miner tries the algorithm again with a slightly altered input to produce a completely new value for the hash. Miners built specifically to perform this function are able to compute trillions of unique hashes each second.\n\nHowever, even if a miner's machine were able to only produce one hash per second, it is theoretically possible that the algorithm's first output could be a valid hash to solve the block.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat were the odds?\n\nThe chances of adding a block as a solo miner are determined by the number of hashes the miner's rig is computing per second in relation to the total number of hashes that all of the machines on the network are computing each second.\n\nAccording to a post from user Willi9974 on the BitcoinTalk forum less than an hour after block 772,793 was solved, the lucky solo miner had an average hash rate over the previous hour of 10.6 TH/s.\n\nThe information posted on BitcoinTalk also revealed that the ~10 TH/s was the combined power of four machines (called \"workers\"). This suggests that this solo miner's rig was likely made up of four USB stick Bitcoin miners, which can individually achieve a hash rate of around 3 TH/s and cost roughly $200 each.\n\nUsing the difficulty level included in block 772,793 and assuming the solo miner's rig was computing 10 TH/s, it is possible to calculate the total estimated hash rate as 269,082,950 TH/s at the time the block was solved.\n\nBased on this, the odds of this solo miner being the first to solve the block with a valid hash are one in 26.9 million. Statistically, that means that if the same circumstances were repeated infinite times, the solo miner would add the block 0.000000037% of the time, on average.\n\nUnlikely, but not impossible\u2014and this has happened before\n\nWhile this scenario was extremely unlikely, similar \"once-in-a-lifetime\" events in Bitcoin mining have happened before.\n\nOne year ago, in less than two weeks, there were three different solo miners that solved blocks with improbable hash rates\u2014the third's hash rate was apparently just 8.3 TH/s in comparison to the estimated 190,719,350 TH/s total hash rate, which comes out to a one in 23 million chance (or 0.000000044%).\n\nA hash is either valid and thus solves the block, or it isn't. There is no strategy involved, as the entire system is based on the random generation of hash values and the response mechanisms of the network to maintain core probabilities. Bitcoin runs on code and formulas, so a solo miner somehow solving the next four blocks is perfectly possible within Bitcoin\u2019s mathematical system.\n\nMining pools remain the usual winners\n\nAnecdotes about solo miners like these could end up introducing a new hobby to the ever-hopeful. However, the vast majority of blocks added to the Bitcoin blockchain today have been produced by large pools of mining rigs that combine their hashing power and share earnings.\n\nIn doing so, each miner's contribution is rewarded proportionally each time the pool mines a block.\n\nAccording to blockchain explorer and mining pool BTC.com, the largest Bitcoin mining pool is currently Foundry USA, with its collective 90.19 EH/s computing power making up 31.3% of the network's total hash rate\u2014which means they earn a share of the block rewards and fees for one in every three blocks, on average.\n\nMining pools date back to 2010 and have steadily captured greater shares of hash rate distribution year over year as mining difficulty increased and mining technology improved. Today, at least 98% of Bitcoin miners online belong to a mining pool."

Beams of light flashed, fireballs erupted and Alicia Keys\u2019 \u201cGirl on Fire\u201d blared through the speakers.\n\n\u201cLooks like a girl, but she\u2019s a flame. So bright, she can burn your eyes \u2013 better look the other way,\u201d the song crooned as a beaming Ignatova thanked the cheering crowd at London\u2019s Wembley Arena.\n\nThat was in June 2016, when cryptocurrency was an emerging buzzword and investors were scrambling to cash in. Ignatova called herself the \u201cCryptoqueen\u201d and touted her company, OneCoin, as a lucrative rival to Bitcoin in the growing cryptocurrency market.\n\n\u201cIn two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin anymore,\u201d she said, as investors applauded and whistled.\n\nSixteen months later, Ignatova boarded a plane in Sofia, Bulgaria, and vanished. She hasn\u2019t been seen since.\n\nAuthorities say OneCoin was a pyramid scheme that defrauded people out of more than $4 billion as Ignatova convinced investors in the US and around the globe to throw fistfuls of cash at her company. Federal prosecutors describe OneCoin as one of the largest international fraud schemes ever perpetrated.\n\nRuja Ignatova is one of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives -- the only woman currently on that list. FBI\n\nShe is now one of the FBI\u2019s 10 most-wanted fugitives, alongside accused gang leaders and murderers, and is the only woman currently on that list. Of the 529 fugitives on the FBI\u2019s list since it launched in 1950, she\u2019s one of just 11 women.\n\nIgnatova and her partners \u201cconned unsuspecting victims out of billions of dollars, claiming that OneCoin would be the \u2018Bitcoin killer,\u2019\u201d US Attorney Damian Williams, New York\u2019s top prosecutor, said in a statement last month.\n\n\u201cIn fact, OneCoins were entirely worthless \u2026 (Their) lies were designed with one goal, to get everyday people all over the world to part with their hard-earned money.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Should you invest in crypto?

She\u2019s also one of the most wanted fugitives in Europe.\n\nAt the bottom of her FBI wanted poster is a note: \u201cIgnatova is believed to travel with armed guards and/or associates. Ignatova may have had plastic surgery or otherwise altered her appearance.\u201d\n\nThe FBI says it picks fugitives for the list based on the length of their criminal records and how dangerous they may be. It also favors fugitives who are not well known to maximize the benefit of the program\u2019s nationwide publicity.\n\nThe bureau declined to provide additional details to CNN beyond court documents from the US Department of Justice, which did not list an attorney for Ignatova. \u201cThis case is an ongoing investigation. We are unable to comment beyond what has already been released publicly,\u201d said Daniel Crifo, a spokesperson for the FBI office in New York.\n\nBut court documents detail a mind-blowing narrative: how Ignatova and her OneCoin co-founder, Karl Sebastian Greenwood, were allegedly aware from the start that their ambitious venture was a Ponzi scheme.\n\n\u201cThe cryptocurrency OneCoin was established for the sole purpose of defrauding investors,\u201d IRS Special Agent John R. Tafur said in a statement.\n\nIgnatova called herself the \"Cryptoqueen\" and touted her company, OneCoin, as a lucrative rival to Bitcoin in the growing cryptocurrency market. U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York/Twitter\n\nWhile Greenwood and Ignatova were working on the concept for OneCoin, they referred to it in emails as a \u201ctrashy coin,\u201d federal officials said in court documents. The documents show Greenwood described their investors as \u201cidiots\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d in an email to Ignatova\u2019s brother, Konstantin Ignatov, who also took part in the scam and assumed OneCoin leadership after his sister vanished, according to prosecutors.\n\n\u201cIt might not be (something) really clean or that I normally work on or even can be proud of (except with you in private when we make the money),\u201d Ignatova wrote to Greenwood in 2014.\n\nShe also proposed an exit strategy should the company fail, saying in a 2014 email to Greenwood that they should \u201ctake the money and run and blame somebody else for this.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Neighbor put his house up for sale after this loud facility popped up next to him without warning 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nFrom a young age, Ignatova wanted to be rich\n\nRuja Ignatova, 42, is a German citizen but was born in Bulgaria, where her father was an engineer and her mother was a teacher.\n\nIn his book, \u201cThe Missing Crypto Queen,\u201d author Jamie Bartlett detailed her rise from modest beginnings to entrepreneurial stardom.\n\nWhen she was a girl, her family moved to Germany, where Ignatova excelled as a student and spent her free time studying and playing chess, Bartlett wrote. Classmates described her as smart, driven and aloof.\n\nIgnatova won a scholarship to a university in Konstanz, Germany, where she met and married a fellow law student. She maintained she didn\u2019t want children, Bartlett wrote, because they would get in the way of her acquiring wealth.\n\nShe also told people she wanted to be a millionaire by age 30.\n\n\u201cShe desperately wanted to be rich, even devouring books in the early hours about how to make money,\u201d Bartlett wrote.\n\nAfter studying European law at Oxford University, Ignatova landed a job in Sofia as a consultant for McKinsey & Company, the international management consulting firm.\n\nClients trusted her and related to her rise from humble beginnings and fierce desire to be rich, Bartlett wrote. Her fluency in languages, including Russian, German, English and Bulgarian, also helped.\n\nAppearances mattered to Ignatova, who often attended events in evening gowns and bright red lipstick, with diamonds dangling from her ears.\n\n\u201cEverything exhibited success and glamor,\u201d Bartlett wrote. \u201cShe was obsessed with style and image.\u201d\n\nKonstantin Ignatov pleaded guilty to fraud and related charges in connection to his sister's company. He's scheduled to be sentenced in February. From Konstantin Ignatov/Instagram\n\nOneCoin allegedly promised investors a fivefold to tenfold return\n\nCryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are digital assets created and managed by a global, decentralized network of computers instead of a bank or government. Bitcoin, for example, is \u201cmined,\u201d or created, by professional crypto miners using armies of servers in data centers.\n\nIt is a largely unregulated and highly volatile industry, and expert opinions on the viability of crypto run the gamut. Advocates broadly envision a future in which economies run on digital currencies validated by the community of users rather by a central bank. Critics dismiss it as a Ponzi scheme or, at minimum, a highly risky investment.\n\nIn 2014, Ignatova and Greenwood, her co-founder, started pitching OneCoin to investors in Europe, New York and around the world. They hosted online webinars and conferences where they urged potential investors to deposit funds in an account that would enable the purchase of OneCoin packages, according to a federal indictment.\n\nOneCoin operated as a multilevel marketing network in which investors received commissions for recruiting others to buy cryptocurrency packages, federal prosecutors said. The packages catered to various income levels, from \u201cstarter\u201d to \u201ctycoon trader.\u201d\n\nIgnatova and her partners promised buyers a fivefold or even tenfold return on their investment, according to court documents.\n\nOneCoin co-founder Karl Sebastian Greenwood, seen in 2016. He later pleaded guilty to wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money. U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York/Twitter\n\nA buying frenzy ensued. Between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, investors gave OneCoin more than $4 billion, federal prosecutors said, citing records obtained in the course of their investigation. Some $50 million came from investors in the US, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cShe timed her scheme perfectly, capitalizing on the frenzied speculation of the early days of cryptocurrency,\u201d said Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.\n\nOneCoins were not mined like other cryptocurrencies, federal investigators said. Instead of armies of powerful servers, OneCoin was generated by a piece of software, court documents said.\n\nFederal prosecutors said that in an email to Greenwood in August 2014, Ignatova wrote, \u201cWe are not mining actually but telling people sh*t.\u201d\n\nOneCoin\u2019s value was not based on market supply and demand like other cryptocurrency, prosecutors said, but simply manipulated privately by OneCoin itself.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback These are the celebs impacted by the collapse of FTX 01:34 - Source: CNN\n\nBut then things came crashing down\n\nThe facade started cracking in 2016 when investors had a hard time selling their OneCoins to recoup their original investments, court documents say.\n\nWord began to spread online that the business was a scam. Media outlets started asking questions. International and US federal investigators got involved.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what happened to Ignatova\u2019s marriage. But the FBI said she learned OneCoin was being investigated after she bugged an apartment belonging to her American boyfriend and found out he was cooperating with a federal probe into her company\u2019s practices.\n\nIn October 2017, the US Department of Justice charged Ignatova with one count each of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. She also was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, which carries a maximum five-year sentence. A federal judge in New York issued a warrant for her arrest.\n\nLess than two weeks later, on October 25, 2017, she boarded a commercial flight from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, court documents said.\n\nThen she disappeared, leaving her business partners to take the fall for the failing company.\n\nThe FBI said it believes she may have traveled on a German passport from Athens, possibly to the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Russia, Eastern Europe or even back to Bulgaria. It\u2019s offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest.\n\n\u201cShe left with a tremendous amount of cash,\u201d Michael Driscoll, the FBI\u2019s assistant director-in-charge in New York, told reporters. \u201cMoney can buy a lot of friends, and I would imagine she\u2019s taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\nHer partners weren\u2019t so lucky. Greenwood was arrested in July 2018 at his home in Koh Samui, Thailand, and extradited to the US. He pleaded guilty in December to wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money. He is in jail and faces 20 years in prison for each of the three counts when he\u2019s sentenced in April.\n\nIgnatova\u2019s brother, Konstantin Ignatov, was arrested in March 2019 at Los Angeles International Airport. He\u2019d traveled to the US on business and was preparing to board his return flight to Bulgaria when five large men in suits handcuffed him and took him to an interrogation room, where they peppered him with questions about his missing sister, Bartlett wrote.\n\nIgnatov pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering and fraud charges, and is scheduled to be sentenced in February.\n\nOneCoin has shut down and its website is no longer active.\n\nBut its founder, the woman in the long gowns and flashy jewelry, has eluded authorities. More than five years after the Cryptoqueen got off a plane in Greece, her whereabouts remain a mystery."

        "content": "After nearly a 20% rally last week, Bitcoin (BTC) is on track to end this week with gains of roughly 10%. Bitcoin\u2019s rally has improved sentiment and attracted buying in several altcoins. This sent the total crypto market capitalization firmly above the $1 trillion mark.\n\nThe strong recovery in Bitcoin has startled several analysts who remain skeptical about the rally. Some believe that the current rise is a dead cat bounce that will reverse direction sharply, while others see similarities between the current rally and the 2018 bear market recovery.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAlthough traders should be ready for any eventuality, the pace of the rise in Bitcoin does point to a possible major bottom. There are likely to be bumps down the road but the dips are likely to be aggressively purchased by traders.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s sustained recovery may encourage buying in select altcoins.\n\nLet\u2019s study the charts of Bitcoin and select altcoins that are showing strength in the near term.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin climbed above the $21,650 overhead resistance on Jan. 20, indicating the resumption of the up-move. This shows that demand remains strong at higher levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls pushed the price above the $22,800 resistance on Jan. 21 but failed to build upon the breakout as seen from the long wick on the day\u2019s candlestick.\n\nWhile the upsloping moving averages indicate that bulls are in command, the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought territory warrants caution. It suggests that a few days of consolidation or minor correction is possible.\n\nHowever, when a new uptrend starts, the RSI sometimes tends to remain in the overbought zone and frustrates the bears. If that happens, the uptrend may continue without a major pullback and the pair could reach $25,211.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at $21,480. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That could increase the likelihood of a rally to $25,211.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to flip the $22,800 level into support. If the price continues higher and soars above $23,271, the bullish momentum could pick up and the pair may rush toward $25,211.\n\nIf the price turns down and breaks below $22,600, the pair could slide to the 20- day exponential moving average (EMA). This level may act as a support but if bears manage to pull the price below it, the next stop could be $21,480.\n\nAPE/USDT\n\nApeCoin (APE) has been range-bound between $7.80 and $3 for the past several months. After the bears failed to sink the price below the range, the bulls are attempting a comeback. They will try to propel the price to the resistance of the range.\n\nAPE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought area suggest that buyers have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance near $6.40 but if buyers bulldoze their way through it, the APE/USDT pair could surge to $7.80. This level may witness aggressive selling by the bears.\n\nThe positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($4.80). That could sink the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($4.17).\n\nAPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is in a strong uptrend. The bears are trying to stall the up-move at $6 but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This indicates that every minor dip is being purchased. The bulls will now try to propel the price above $6 and resume the uptrend.\n\nOn the contrary, the bears will try to pull the price below the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the pair could attract profit-booking from the short-term bulls. The pair could then tumble to $5.\n\nMANA/USDT\n\nDecentraland (MANA) rallied sharply from $0.28 on Dec. 30 to $0.78 on Jan. 21, which shows strong momentum in favor of the bulls.\n\nMANA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears sold the break above $0.74 on Jan. 17 but the bulls stepped in and bought the dip at $0.61. This shows that the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls will have to sustain the price above $0.74 to signal the start of the next leg of the recovery. The MANA/USDT pair could surge to $0.87 and thereafter to the psychological barrier at $1.\n\nIf bears want to gain the upper hand, they will have to sink the price below $0.61. If they do that, the pair could start a deeper correction to $0.53.\n\nMANA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. If buyers thrust the price above the neckline of the pattern, the setup will complete and the pair could spurt toward the target objective at $0.93.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears are fiercely guarding the $0.74 resistance. The pair could then plunge to the $0.61 to $0.55 support zone.\n\nRelated: Terra lending protocol Mars to launch mainnet\n\nAAVE/USDT\n\nAave (AAVE) broke and closed above the downtrend line on Jan. 17 signaling a potential trend change. The bears tried to yank the price back below the downtrend line on Jan. 18 but the bulls held their ground.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($74) and the RSI in the overbought region suggest that bulls have the edge. This advantage could strengthen further with a break above $92. The AAVE/USDT pair could then rally to the psychologically crucial level of $100.\n\nThis level may again pose a strong challenge to buyers but if they overcome this obstacle, the pair could skyrocket toward $115.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and dives below the downtrend line, it will signal that bears are active at higher levels. The advantage may tilt in favor of the bears on a slide below the 20-day EMA.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are defending the zone between $88 and $91 but they haven\u2019t been able to pull the price below the moving averages. This indicates a bullish sentiment where traders are buying the dips.\n\nThe bulls will make one more attempt to clear the overhead zone. If they can pull it off, the pair could resume the uptrend.\n\nInstead, if the bulls fail to push the price above $91, the bears will try to tug the pair below the moving averages. The pair could then fall to $78 and later to $73.\n\nFIL/USDT\n\nFilecoin (FIL) broke above the downtrend line on Jan. 14 and held the retest of the breakout level on Jan. 18. This suggests that the bulls have flipped the downtrend line into support.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the overbought space, signaling that bulls are in control. The FIL/USDT pair could rally to $6.50 where the bears may again mount a strong defense. If bulls kick the price above this level, the up-move could reach $9 with a brief halt near $7.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($4.24) is the important support to watch out for on the downside because a drop below it could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nFIL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears tried to stall the relief rally at $5 but the bulls pierced this resistance and started the next leg of the recovery. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that bulls are firmly in the driver\u2019s seat. Buyers will try to nudge the pair toward $6.50 and then $7.\n\nOn the downside, the 20-EMA is the critical support to pay attention to. If the price rebounds off this level, it will indicate that the uptrend remains intact. On the other hand, if bears drag the price below the moving averages, the pair could collapse to $4.20.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Stellar Blockchain: Overview, History, FAQ - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is Stellar Blockchain?\n\nThe Stellar blockchain is one of the hundreds of networks that store and transmit cryptocurrencies. As bitcoin garnered headlines over the past ten years, many other virtual currencies and platforms racked up impressive gains and user bases. The stellar blockchain, with its lumens token, is one of them.\n\nIn early 2021, the value of Stellar's lumen token grew more than fivefold, from $0.13 to $0.73, before collapsing over the following year. As of early 2023, the lumen token is trading for about $0.08, according to the crypto data site CoinMarketCap.\n\nKey Takeaways The Stellar blockchain is a distributed ledger used to transmit digital currencies.\n\nThe main token of the Stellar blockchain is Stellar lumens or XLM.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain uses a consensus algorithm that is faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than that of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, who also founded Mt. Gox and co-founded Ripple.\n\nCritics say that the Stellar blockchain is centralized around the Stellar Development Foundation, which controls a large share of the lumens tokens.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Stellar Blockchain\n\nStellar's basic operation is similar to that of most decentralized payment technologies. It runs a network of decentralized servers with a distributed ledger that is updated every two to five seconds among all nodes. The most prominent distinguishing factor between Stellar and bitcoin is its consensus protocol.\n\n\n\nStellar\u2019s consensus protocol does not rely on the entire miner network to approve transactions. Instead, it uses the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) algorithm, which enables faster processing of transactions. This is because it uses quorum slices (or a portion of the network) to approve and validate a transaction.\n\nEach node in the Stellar network chooses another set of \u201ctrustworthy\u201d nodes. Once a transaction is approved by all nodes within this set, then it is considered approved. The shortened process has made Stellar's network extremely fast and it is said to process as many as 1,000 network operations per second.\n\nHow the Stellar Blockchain Process Works\n\nThe current process for cross-border transfers is a complicated one. It requires domestic banks to maintain accounts in foreign jurisdictions in local currencies. Their correspondent banks must operate a similar account in the original country.\n\nThe Nostro-Vostro process, as it is known, for cross-border transactions with fiat currencies is a lengthy one involving conversion and reconciliation of accounts. Because it enables simultaneous validation, Stellar\u2019s blockchain can shorten or eliminate the delays and complexity involved.\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumens cryptocurrency can also be used to provide liquidity and streamline the process. According to some reports, banks will use their own cryptocurrencies to facilitate such transfers in the future. According to David Mazi\u00e8res, a Stanford University professor and SCP creator, the protocol has \u201cmodest\u201d computing and financial requirements. This enables even organizations with minimal IT budgets, such as nonprofits, to participate in its network.\n\nHistory of Stellar Blockchain\n\nStellar was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb (pictured), who also co-founded the cryptocurrency company Ripple and the exchange Mt. Gox. After leaving Ripple over his differences with other co-founders, McCaleb and his partner Joyce Kim launched the Stellar protocol as a fork of the Ripple codebase. Payments company Stripe provided $3 million in seed funding.\n\nStellar came into the spotlight in October 2017 after it announced a partnership with IBM. The partnership envisages the setting up of multiple currency corridors among nations in the South Pacific.\n\nThe project stated a goal of processing up to 60% of all cross-border payments in the region, which includes countries like Australia, Fiji, and Tonga. This would enable connections between small businesses, non-profits, and local banking institutions to expedite commercial transactions. For example, a farmer in Samoa would be able to connect and conduct transactions with a buyer in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2016, prominent technology consulting firm Deloitte also announced a partnership with Stellar to develop a payments app. At a conference in 2017, McCaleb confirmed that 30 banks signed up to use Stellar\u2019s blockchain for cross-border transfers.\n\nEach Stellar wallet must maintain a minimum balance in order to exist. At present, each account must maintain a base reserve of 1 XLM.\n\nConcerns About Stellar Blockchain\n\nFollowing the launch of the Stellar protocol, many investors raised alarms about the high number of lumens tokens controlled by the Stellar Development Foundation. Rather than let Stellar nodes \"mine\" new cryptocurrency, the creators of Stellar simply created 100 billion lumens tokens. The vast majority of them were assigned to the Stellar Development Foundation.\n\nAlthough these resources are ostensibly intended to fund development and adoption, some investors worry that they could be sold on the market, thereby diluting the holdings of potential investors. In order to address these concerns, the SDF intentionally destroyed 55 billion lumens tokens in 2019.\n\nThere are also concerns that the network relies on a small number of nodes, many of them controlled by the SDF. In 2019, two of those nodes unexpectedly failed, causing the Stellar blockchain to halt for over an hour.\n\nStellar Blockchain vs. Ripple\n\nStellar is an open-source payment technology that shares several similarities with Ripple and its XRP cryptocurrency. Like Ripple, Stellar is a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers.\n\nBoth networks use similar protocols and were derived from the same codebase. In both protocols, there is no mining or algorithmic proof-of-work: All tokens were created at the moment the blockchain was launched.\n\nThe majority of XRP tokens are controlled by Ripple, a for-profit company, while the majority of lumens tokens are held by the nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation. While Ripple is a closed system, Stellar is open-source.\n\n\n\nThey also have different customers. Ripple works with established banking institutions and consortiums in order to streamline their cross-border transfer technology. In contrast, Stellar is focused on developing markets and has multiple use cases for its technology, including money remittances and bank loan distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is XLM Crypto? XLM, or Stellar lumens, is the native cryptocurrency of the stellar blockchain and it is used to pay transaction fees. However, it is not the only cryptocurrency on the Stellar blockchain, which can be used to move tokens representing anything from commodities to fiat currencies.\n\nHow Do I Check the Blockchain for a Stellar Transaction? You can check a stellar transaction on a stellar-focused block explorer. These are online tools that allow users to view recent transactions, blocks, and account balances. Popular Stellar explorers include Stellarchain.io, Blockchair.com, and StellarExpert.\n\nHow Does Stellar Blockchain Work? The Stellar blockchain uses a proof-of-agreement consensus algorithm to ensure coordination between different nodes. These nodes broadcast transactions to one another every five seconds, ensuring that they are all keeping identical versions of the Stellar ledger.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Stellar blockchain is one of the thousands of competitors to Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is used for fast, cheap transactions with minimal computational or energy costs. Although it has occasionally enjoyed sharp price rises, the value of Stellar lumens has plunged with respect to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Invest in Crypto in 2023 -- and 1 Reason Not To - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that the last year has been rough for crypto.\n\nBitcoin (BTC 2.41%) and Ethereum (ETH 1.95%) are both down roughly 70% from their peaks, and Cardano and Solana have plummeted by around 90%. Those numbers are tough to stomach, and many investors have fled the crypto market in recent months.\n\nIf you're nervous about the market right now, you're not alone. But should you keep investing? There are three reasons to stick with crypto in 2023, and one reason you're better off avoiding it for now.\n\nWhy now could be a smart buying opportunity\n\n1. Prices are at rock bottom\n\nAt its peak, Bitcoin cost nearly $70,000 per token, and Ethereum was priced at close to $5,000 per token. Today, Bitcoin stands at just under $21,000, with Ethereum at roughly $1,500.\n\nIf you've been looking for a more affordable time to invest in crypto, you may not get a better chance than right now. The crypto market is essentially on clearance at the moment, and it's possible to load up on quality investments for a fraction of the price.\n\n2. The upswing could be lucrative\n\nOf course, nobody knows for certain whether the crypto market will recover. However, downturns like this aren't necessarily uncommon in this industry, and major cryptocurrencies have faced worse in the past.\n\nFor example, back in 2018, Ethereum's price fell by nearly 95% over the course of the year. If you had invested at its lowest point, you would have seen returns of nearly 4,500% over the following three years alone.\n\nAgain, it's unclear what the future holds for crypto, and we may not see another rally similar to the 2020-2021 surge. But even if cryptocurrencies don't reach their all-time highs again anytime soon, even a relatively small upswing could still be lucrative if you invest at rock-bottom prices.\n\n3. You might regret not investing\n\nCrypto is a speculative investment, so nobody -- even the experts -- knows how it will fare over the long term. While it could fail, it could also change the world.\n\nWhen you're deciding whether to invest, consider which of these options you'd regret more: investing now and losing money if crypto fails, or not investing and missing out on the investment of a lifetime if crypto succeeds.\n\nTo be clear, this doesn't mean you should go all-in and invest every dollar you have in crypto. As with any investment, it's important to buy wisely and only invest what you can afford. But for some people, it's worth risking a little money to avoid the regret of not taking this chance.\n\nWhy it may be best to avoid crypto\n\n1. You're a risk-averse investor\n\nFor all its potential, crypto also carries a significant amount of risk. At the moment, it's impossible to know whether crypto will succeed, and there's always a chance that you could lose whatever you invest. If money is tight, now may not be the best time to buy.\n\nAlso, this investment is notorious for its extreme volatility. Even in good times, it can experience nauseating ups and downs. Not all investors have the stomach for crypto, and that's OK. If you know you'd lose sleep over that level of volatility, you might be better off sticking to stocks for now.\n\nThe future of crypto is uncertain, and whether you choose to invest now will depend largely on your risk tolerance and personal preferences. But if a rebound is on the way, right now may be one of the best chances to buy."

        "content": "On January 18, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) recovered all of its previous losses caused by the FTX epidemic and reached its highest point at $22,216 on Friday afternoon. The asset\u2019s rise to a level of more than $22,000 caused market participants to experience heightened levels of euphoria, even while crypto behemoths like Genesis filed for bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price To Hit $35K?\n\nBitcoin recently surpassed the $420 billion market cap as its trading volume witnessed an increase of 17.45% at $25 billion in the course of the past 24 hours. This has led many to believe Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price to hit the coveted $25K price mark in the coming days if the crypto market is devoid of any further black swan events. However, according to the prominent crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe, the price of the flagship cryptocurrency might reach as high as $35,000. According to his analysis, there will most likely be a certain time period this year \u2013ranging from two to four months\u2013during which the markets will see a significant relief rally. It\u2019s possible that the scenario is already set in motion at the present time.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMassive BTC Whale Activity\n\nThis seems to hold true as reports of massive whale accumulation have also been tracked down. According to on-chain data, there has been an increase of more than 3% in the count of BTC whales owning 100 to 1,000 BTCs, in the recent two months. At the time of this publication, there were a total of 14,110 whale addresses in this cohort.\n\nRead More: Check Out The Top Crypto Telegram Channels Of 2023\n\nOn the other hand, Kim Young Ju, co-founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, a platform for crypto on-chain monitoring, also noted certain whale activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. A notification was sent out by Ju in the form of a tweet indicating that miners participating in the 1THash pool had sent 3,336 Bitcoins to the Binance exchange.\n\nAs things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $22,106. This represents an increase of 4.67% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 14% during the week as per CoinGape\u2019s crypto market tracker.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Fraudster Charged In $4.5 Bn Bitcoin Theft Lands New Marketing Job"

        "content": "A recent upswing in the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has provoked a distantly familiar debate: whether a market rebound could be imminent or if recent trends are just a prelude to more pain.\n\nSince Bitcoin reached an all-time high of around $69,000 in November of 2021, digital assets have been walloped by higher interest rates and a series of high-profile collapses\u2013firms like Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX, to name a few.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is down nearly 67% from its peak, digital assets\u2013and other investments like stocks\u2013have had a positive start to the year.

Ethereum, meanwhile, has seen the value of ETH rise around 38% as well to $1,645, according to CoinGecko.\n\nCryptocurrency prices began rising earlier this month in anticipation of an economic report that showed inflation cooled in December. The reading also lifted hopes about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates less aggressively than they have in the past year to tame soaring prices.\n\n2022 Wasn't All Bad for Crypto (Just Mostly)\n\nBut be weary, say the cautious. Many crypto commentators believe the recent uptick in prices is too good to be true and are labeling the rally a bull trap, predicting the breakout will come crashing down and burn traders who mistook it as the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nOthers following the rally are also skeptical. A Twitter poll conducted by a popular Bitcoin page reached a consensus among over 18,000 participants that the rally was indeed a bull trap on Jan. 15.\n\nMore recently, \u201cil Capo Of Crypto,\u201d a prominent influencer and self-proclaimed crypto analyst, agreed with the bearish take, saying the rally \u201cclearly looks manipulated\u201d and is the \u201cbiggest bull trap\u201d they\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nI've been checking charts all this time, avoiding noise from Twitter.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA solo Bitcoin miner with an average hashing power of just 10 TH/s (terahashes per second) won the race to add block 772,793 to the Bitcoin blockchain on Friday.\n\nAt the time the block was added, Bitcoin's total hash rate was just over 269 exahash per second, meaning the solo miner's 10 TH/s hash rate represented just 0.000000037% of the blockchain's entire computational power.\n\nPut simply: It was an extremely unlikely win for an individual miner.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCongratulations to miner 1CEmkQkgiCMx6DHSDkHi53mL8oEthCZSw with only 10TH who solved a solo block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc ! https://t.co/0O7A7KR4eu \u2014 Dr. Con Kolivas (@ckpooldev) January 20, 2023\n\nDespite the odds stacked against them, the solo miner was the first to produce a valid hash for the block to be mined. In return, the miner received 98% of the total 6.35939231 BTC allotted for the block reward and fees. The remaining 2% went to Solo CK Pool, an online mining service that facilitates individual mining.\n\nBitcoin's randomness and probabilities coded for luck and work\n\nTo add a block to a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin, the miner must be the first to calculate a valid hash for the block, which can only be discovered using brute computational force.\n\nMining machines run an encryption algorithm to produce a hash that falls below a threshold specified by the network. If the algorithm produces a value that is above the hash target, the miner tries the algorithm again with a slightly altered input to produce a completely new value for the hash. Miners built specifically to perform this function are able to compute trillions of unique hashes each second.\n\nHowever, even if a miner's machine were able to only produce one hash per second, it is theoretically possible that the algorithm's first output could be a valid hash to solve the block.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat were the odds?\n\nThe chances of adding a block as a solo miner are determined by the number of hashes the miner's rig is computing per second in relation to the total number of hashes that all of the machines on the network are computing each second.\n\nAccording to a post from user Willi9974 on the BitcoinTalk forum less than an hour after block 772,793 was solved, the lucky solo miner had an average hash rate over the previous hour of 10.6 TH/s.\n\nThe information posted on BitcoinTalk also revealed that the ~10 TH/s was the combined power of four machines (called \"workers\"). This suggests that this solo miner's rig was likely made up of four USB stick Bitcoin miners, which can individually achieve a hash rate of around 3 TH/s and cost roughly $200 each.\n\nUsing the difficulty level included in block 772,793 and assuming the solo miner's rig was computing 10 TH/s, it is possible to calculate the total estimated hash rate as 269,082,950 TH/s at the time the block was solved.\n\nBased on this, the odds of this solo miner being the first to solve the block with a valid hash are one in 26.9 million. Statistically, that means that if the same circumstances were repeated infinite times, the solo miner would add the block 0.000000037% of the time, on average.\n\nUnlikely, but not impossible\u2014and this has happened before\n\nWhile this scenario was extremely unlikely, similar \"once-in-a-lifetime\" events in Bitcoin mining have happened before.\n\nOne year ago, in less than two weeks, there were three different solo miners that solved blocks with improbable hash rates\u2014the third's hash rate was apparently just 8.3 TH/s in comparison to the estimated 190,719,350 TH/s total hash rate, which comes out to a one in 23 million chance (or 0.000000044%).\n\nA hash is either valid and thus solves the block, or it isn't. There is no strategy involved, as the entire system is based on the random generation of hash values and the response mechanisms of the network to maintain core probabilities. Bitcoin runs on code and formulas, so a solo miner somehow solving the next four blocks is perfectly possible within Bitcoin\u2019s mathematical system.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMining pools remain the usual winners\n\nAnecdotes about solo miners like these could end up introducing a new hobby to the ever-hopeful. However, the vast majority of blocks added to the Bitcoin blockchain today have been produced by large pools of mining rigs that combine their hashing power and share earnings.\n\nIn doing so, each miner's contribution is rewarded proportionally each time the pool mines a block.\n\nAccording to blockchain explorer and mining pool BTC.com, the largest Bitcoin mining pool is currently Foundry USA, with its collective 90.19 EH/s computing power making up 31.3% of the network's total hash rate\u2014which means they earn a share of the block rewards and fees for one in every three blocks, on average.\n\nMining pools date back to 2010 and have steadily captured greater shares of hash rate distribution year over year as mining difficulty increased and mining technology improved. Today, at least 98% of Bitcoin miners online belong to a mining pool."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA recent upswing in the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has provoked a distantly familiar debate: whether a market rebound could be imminent or if recent trends are just a prelude to more pain.\n\nSince Bitcoin reached an all-time high of around $69,000 in November of 2021, digital assets have been walloped by higher interest rates and a series of high-profile collapses\u2013firms like Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX, to name a few.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is down nearly 67% from its peak, digital assets\u2013and other investments like stocks\u2013have had a positive start to the year. The price of Bitcoin has risen 38% so far this month to $22,858, its highest price since last August. Ethereum, meanwhile, has seen the value of ETH rise around 38% as well to $1,645, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCryptocurrency prices began rising earlier this month in anticipation of an economic report that showed inflation cooled in December. The reading also lifted hopes about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates less aggressively than they have in the past year to tame soaring prices.\n\nBut be weary, say the cautious. Many crypto commentators believe the recent uptick in prices is too good to be true and are labeling the rally a bull trap, predicting the breakout will come crashing down and burn traders who mistook it as the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nOthers following the rally are also skeptical. A Twitter poll conducted by a popular Bitcoin page reached a consensus among over 18,000 participants that the rally was indeed a bull trap on Jan. 15.\n\nMore recently, \u201cil Capo Of Crypto,\u201d a prominent influencer and self-proclaimed crypto analyst, agreed with the bearish take, saying the rally \u201cclearly looks manipulated\u201d and is the \u201cbiggest bull trap\u201d they\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nI've been checking charts all this time, avoiding noise from Twitter.

        "title": "Litecoin vs. Bitcoin: Similarities and Differences - OKX",
        "content": "As of January 2023, it's been 14 years since the cryptocurrency industry came into existence. Over the last decade and a half, almost, the industry has been through a lot. It has seen the launch of over 22,000 different altcoins. It has had a year-long bull market and two year-long bear markets, popularly called crypto winters. The blockchain \u2014 the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies \u2014 has seen the launch of numerous products.\n\nBut, even after all these years, the crypto industry still sees only one altcoin as a real competitor to Bitcoin. That is, of course, Litecoin \u2014 silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold. In this guide, we will compare the two and see what it is that makes them similar as well as different. If you are new to the crypto industry, this Litecoin vs. Bitcoin article might give you some new insight. Also, it might even help you decide which of them you like more.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was described in a 2008 document published on October 31 by an individual or group known only as Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite over a decade and a half passing, the identity of Nakamoto remains unknown. The document explains that Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency run by the members of the community.\n\nNo government, bank, or single entity would have any power over it or the network on which it runs. Instead, it would be a peer-to-peer online currency, with an explanation of how it would be implemented. Nakamoto also explained that its underlying technology would be a decentralized ledger of transactions packed into batches or blocks. All of it would use cryptographic algorithms for security, which is how blockchain came to be.\n\nIt would also have a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which would be released in small quantities. Whenever a block is \u201csolved\u201d through computing power that processes transactions, a small portion of BTC gets released. Initially, it was 50 BTC, with plans to cut this amount in half whenever 210,000 blocks get solved. This is called the halving, and it happens after every four years, roughly.\n\nNakamoto made the first Bitcoin transaction on January 3, 2009, thus solving its Genesis block. This launched the first 50 BTC into circulation, and the process has never stopped since.\n\nEssentially worthless at first, Bitcoin\u2019s real value was in the idea that created it. This idea of digital money that no government could control attracted tech geeks but also online criminals. But, it also gave BTC its first price, moving it from $0 for the first time due to simple demand.\n\nTo this day, Bitcoin has grown a lot, once even reaching the value of $69,000 per coin. But it all started with Nakamoto. After receiving its value, Bitcoin quickly attracted a group of developers who started working on it. Meanwhile, Satoshi Nakamoto withdraws into the shadows after a few years of spreading the word about his creation. As years went by, new cryptos started to launch, inspired by Bitcoin. Each of them believed it could either do better or bring something new to the growing crypto industry.\n\nAbout two years after Bitcoin\u2019s launch, its largest competitor emerged \u2014 a coin known as Litecoin (LTC).\n\nWhat is Litecoin (LTC)?\n\nLike Bitcoin, Litecoin also emerged as a decentralized digital asset. It also relied on the decentralized community that would supply it with computing power to maintain security and validity. However, Litecoin was one of the projects that wanted to improve Bitcoin\u2019s technology.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s idea was revolutionizing, its technology was (and still is) very flawed. Bitcoin can only process one block per 10 minutes, and each block can only store a handful of transactions. This makes it very slow, and it is unfit to satisfy global demand. So, one developer \u2014 Charlie Lee \u2014 came up with the idea of creating a similar but better asset.\n\nThis is how Litecoin came to be. One of many forks of Bitcoin, Litecoin is named like this because it is the \u201clite version of Bitcoin.\u201d It is four times faster than the original, thanks to this fact, and more accessible. It never saw the massive transaction fees that Bitcoin has, either. However, it does share a lot of Bitcoin\u2019s characteristics and features.\n\nSome of them include decentralization and the use of the same Proof of Work algorithm. However, Litecoin uses a different hashing function called Scrypt. Its coin supply sits at 84 million cryptocurrencies, and its transaction time is 2.5 minutes.\n\nLitecoin also uses halving; only it happens after every 840,000 blocks. Litecoin\u2019s network is four times faster. Meanwhile, the number of blocks needed for the halving is four times larger. This means that the halving still happens roughly every four years. At the same time, the total supply is four times larger than Bitcoin\u2019s, as well.\n\nAll of this means that Litecoin is a lighter, more efficient version of Bitcoin.\n\nThe similarities between Bitcoin and Litecoin\n\nBitcoin and Litecoin share a number of similarities, some of which we already mentioned. They are both decentralized, they rely on Proof of Work, and they operate as utility coins, meaning digital money. They rely on the community to supply them with the computing power needed for confirmation transactions.\n\nThey both conduct the halving process after a specific number of blocks, releasing coins in return. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin also started by granting its community 50 LTC per block until the halving had started.\n\nHowever, the two share a number of differences, and these differences are far more impactful than their similarities.\n\nThe differences between Bitcoin and Litecoin\n\nLitecoin, silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold, was created by Charlie Lee, rather than an anonymous individual or group. Lee is a well-known and respected member of the crypto industry who publicly supports his project.\n\nAnother difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin lies in their transaction speed. Bitcoin can process 5 to 7 transactions per second, requiring 10 minutes to form a block. Meanwhile, each block can only store 1MB of data. This makes it incredibly slow. At the same time, Litecoin can process 54 transactions per second. It needs around 2.5 minutes to create a block, and it is four times faster than BTC.\n\nIt uses its own cryptocurrency, LTC, which has a significantly smaller market capitalization. Even now, after a year of price drops, BTC has a market cap of $407.4 billion. Meanwhile, Litecoin only has $6.1 billion. Their technology also differs slightly, as Bitcoin uses a SHA-256 mining algorithm, while Litecoin uses Scrypt.\n\nBitcoin vs. Litecoin on charts\n\nLooking at the charts of the two assets, we can also see differences in their price performance over the years.\n\nBitcoin, for example, showed several major price surges. The one in late 2017 is now a minor blip, although, at the time, it was a massive development. It was, however, completely overshadowed by two surges in 2021.\n\nLitecoin, on the other hand, barely exceeded its 2017 high during the 2021 bull runs. It managed to do it only once, while the second 2021 price surge did not even reach the 2017 level.\n\nThe reason for this is simply the fact that Bitcoin is more popular. Despite having worse technological capabilities, it is the first crypto. Its brand, size, potential use cases, level of adoption, and more, guarantee its success. Litecoin is well-adopted by many online websites in its own right, and it is far from being an unsuccessful coin. However, for the time being, its technological improvements were not enough to beat Bitcoin\u2019s brand.\n\nBitcoin vs. Litecoin: which is better?\n\nIn the end, deciding which of the two is better is a personal choice. Technologically speaking, Litecoin is four times Bitcoin\u2019s superior. However, when it comes to popularity, use cases, brand size, and other aspects, there is no comparison. Bitcoin wins every time if we use these parameters to compare the two. Essentially, it all comes down to what you prefer \u2014 the security of Bitcoin\u2019s brand or the benefits of Litecoin\u2019s network.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Litecoin better than Bitcoin?\n\nTechnologically speaking, yes. Litecoin has more advanced technology that makes it four times faster. However, Litecoin is a smaller, less popular altcoin, while Bitcoin dominates the crypto industry.\n\nWill Litecoin overtake Bitcoin?\n\nCurrently, it appears unlikely that Litecoin will surpass Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a two-year head start in building its brand. Despite its imperfections, it holds significant value as the first cryptocurrency.\n\nWho created Litecoin?\n\nLitecoin was created by a developer called Charlie Lee. Lee developed it two years after the launch of Bitcoin. Before launching Litecoin, Lee was a Google engineer.\n\nWho created Bitcoin?\n\nThe truth is that nobody knows the identity of Bitcoin\u2019s creator. They could be a person or an entire team. All that is known is their alias, Satoshi Nakamoto."

        "content": "The bitcoin dominance chart is a widely used metric in the cryptocurrency market. It can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of bitcoin compared to other digital assets and help identify trends and patterns in the market. As a result, many investors and traders use this chart to make informed decisions about the cryptocurrency market. But what exactly does the [bitcoin dominance chart](/learn/understanding-bitcoin-dominance-a-comprehensive-guide) measure, and what are its implications for the crypto market?\n\nThis blog will explore the history, how it is measured, factors affecting the bitcoin dominance chart, and its role in understanding the crypto market.\n\nWhat Is The Bitcoin Dominance Chart/Index?\n\nBitcoin Dominance Chart (also known as [Bitcoin Dominance Index](/learn/understanding-bitcoin-dominance-a-comprehensive-guide)) is a metric that measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin holds. In other words, it shows how much of the total value of all digital currencies is attributed to Bitcoin. This metric is often used to gauge the overall strength and influence of the Bitcoin market compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart is calculated by taking the market capitalization of Bitcoin and dividing it by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a single unit of a cryptocurrency by the total number of units in circulation. This metric is updated in real-time and is widely used to track the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other digital assets.\n\nThe metric is also used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market. When the Bitcoin Dominance Chart is high, it indicates that Bitcoin is dominating the market and other cryptocurrencies are not performing as well. When the chart is low, it suggests that other cryptocurrencies are gaining market share and potentially overtaking Bitcoin in terms of overall value.\n\nIt is important to note that the Bitcoin Dominance Chart is not a measure of the actual value of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of the relative market share. It can also be used to get a sense of the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. A high Bitcoin Dominance ratio can indicate a strong and stable market, while a low chart can indicate a more volatile and uncertain market.\n\nHistory of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart\n\nThe history of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart can be traced back to the early days of the cryptocurrency market when Bitcoin (BTC) was the only major player. According to a Medium post by Jimmy Song, the Bitcoin Dominance Index was originally created to illustrate how importance Bitcoin had in the overall crypto economy. At the time, Bitcoin accounted for nearly 100% of the cryptocurrency market capitalization, so the metric was an important way to measure the relative importance of the first digital currency to scale.\n\nHowever, as the crypto market evolved and more and more alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) emerged, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart became less relevant as a measure of the overall market. The crypto bull market of 2020 and 2021 saw the rise of new projects and protocols, which increased the market capitalization of other digital assets, diluting the dominance of Bitcoin and making the metric less meaningful.\n\nDespite this, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart remains an important tool for investors and traders as it can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of Bitcoin (BTC) compared to other digital assets. It can also be used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market, which can be useful for making predictions about future price movements. While the metric may not be as relevant as it once was, it still plays a role in understanding the overall health of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHow Is Bitcoin Dominance Measured?\n\nBitcoin dominance is a measure of the market share of Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies. It is calculated by taking the market capitalization of Bitcoin and dividing it by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a single unit of a cryptocurrency by the total number of units in circulation.\n\nFor example, if the market capitalization of Bitcoin is $200 billion and the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is $300 billion, then Bitcoin dominance is 66.67% ($200 billion / $300 billion). This means that 66.67% of the total value of all digital currencies is attributed to Bitcoin.\n\nThe market capitalization of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is typically obtained from cryptocurrency exchanges, which provide real-time data on the price and trading volume of various digital assets. These data are then used to calculate the market capitalization of each cryptocurrency. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is obtained by summing the market capitalization of each cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is important to note that the Bitcoin Dominance Chart is not a measure of the actual value of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of the relative market share. It can be used to get a sense of the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. A high Bitcoin Dominance ratio can indicate a strong and stable market, while a low chart can indicate a more volatile and uncertain market.\n\nInvestors and traders widely use the Bitcoin Dominance Chart to understand the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other digital assets and also to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market. However, use this metric with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFactors Influencing Bitcoin Dominance\n\nSeveral factors can influence the Bitcoin Dominance Chart and the market share of Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies. Some of the main factors include:\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nMarket sentiment refers to the overall attitude of investors towards a particular asset or market. If market sentiment towards Bitcoin is positive, it can drive up the price and market capitalization of Bitcoin, which will increase its dominance. On the other hand, if market sentiment toward Bitcoin is negative, it can drive down the price and market capitalization of Bitcoin, which will decrease its dominance.\n\nInnovations and Developments in Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nInnovations and developments in other cryptocurrencies can also influence the Bitcoin Dominance Chart. For example, if a new cryptocurrency is launched that offers a unique value proposition or solves a problem that Bitcoin does not, it can attract investment and drive up its market capitalization, which will decrease Bitcoin's dominance.\n\nRegulations\n\nGovernment regulations can also have a significant impact on the Bitcoin Dominance Chart. For example, if a government announces a crackdown on cryptocurrency trading or mining, it can lead to a decrease in the price and market capitalization of Bitcoin and an increase in the dominance of other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMedia coverage\n\nMedia coverage can also play a role in influencing the Bitcoin Dominance Chart. Negative or positive news coverage can affect the market sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which can drive the prices up or down and alter the dominance.\n\nCompetition Between Cryptocurrencies\n\nAs the number of cryptocurrencies increase, competition for market share also increases. This can lead to fluctuations in the dominance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Bitcoin Dominance Chart is not a measure of the actual value of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of the relative market share. It can also be used to get a sense of the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. A high Bitcoin Dominance Chart can indicate a strong and stable market, while a low chart can indicate a more volatile and uncertain market.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Chart: Uses\n\nSome of the main uses of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart include:\n\nUnderstanding Relative Performance\n\nComparing Bitcoin's performance to other digital assets, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart offers a valuable perspective. By tracking the market share of Bitcoin, it allows identifying patterns and trends within the cryptocurrency market. This information can be utilized for forecasting the future direction of the market and making educated investment decisions.\n\nIdentifying Market Trends\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart can also be used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market. When the chart is high, it indicates that Bitcoin dominates the market and other cryptocurrencies are not performing as well. When the chart is low, it suggests that other cryptocurrencies are gaining market share and potentially overtaking Bitcoin in terms of overall value.\n\nIdentifying Entry and Exit Points\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart can also be used to identify entry and exit points in the cryptocurrency market. For example, when the chart is high, it may indicate a good time to sell Bitcoin and invest in other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, when the chart is low, it may indicate a good time to buy Bitcoin and reduce exposure to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAssessing Overall Market Health\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart can also be used to assess the cryptocurrency market's overall health. A high Bitcoin Dominance Chart can indicate a strong and stable market, while a low chart can indicate a more volatile and uncertain market.\n\nIt's important to note that the Bitcoin Dominance Chart should be used with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market. However, when used correctly, it can be a valuable tool for making informed decisions about the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Chart Disadvantages\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart is a widely used metric in the cryptocurrency market, but it also has certain disadvantages that should be considered. Some of the main disadvantages of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart include the following:\n\nIncreased Supply\n\nThe increase in the number of cryptocurrencies in the market dilutes the dominance of Bitcoin and can make the metric less relevant. In addition, as more and more alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) emerge, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart becomes less meaningful as a measure of the overall market.\n\nMarket Cap Shortcomings\n\nThe market capitalization used to calculate the Bitcoin Dominance Chart has certain shortcomings. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a single unit of a cryptocurrency by the total number of units in circulation. However, this method does not consider other factors, such as the underlying technology, network effects, and adoption. This means that the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency does not necessarily reflect its true value.\n\nNot Measuring the Actual Value\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart is not a measure of the actual value of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of the relative market share. It can also be used to get a sense of the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. However, it is important to note that this metric should be used in conjunction with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin Dominance vs. Ethereum Dominance\n\nBitcoin Dominance and Ethereum Dominance are two metrics used to measure the respective cryptocurrencies' market share of the respective cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, compared to other digital assets. Both metrics are calculated by taking the market capitalization of the respective cryptocurrency and dividing it by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Dominance measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin holds. It is often used to gauge the overall strength and influence of the Bitcoin market compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum Dominance, on the other hand, measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that Ethereum holds. It is often used as a gauge of the overall strength and influence of the Ethereum market compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBoth metrics can be used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market, which can be useful for making predictions about future price movements. However, it's important to note that these metrics are not a measure of the actual value of the respective cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of their relative market share.\n\nIt's also important to note that the market share can fluctuate over time. For example, Bitcoin's dominance has been declining in recent years as more and more altcoins emerge and gain market share, while Ethereum's dominance has been increasing as it's being adopted as the main blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other use cases.\n\nIt's crucial to consider both Bitcoin Dominance and Ethereum Dominance to comprehensively understand the cryptocurrency market and make informed decisions about investments.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Chart: A Reliable Indicator?\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart is a widely used metric in the cryptocurrency market. It is often used as a reliable indicator of Bitcoin's market share compared to other digital assets. However, it's important to consider that while the metric can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, it has certain limitations that should be taken into account.\n\nOne of the main limitations of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart is that it is based on market capitalization, which can be a flawed measure of the actual value of a cryptocurrency. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a single unit of a cryptocurrency by the total number of units in circulation. However, this method does not take into account other factors, such as the underlying technology, network effects, and adoption. This means that the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency does not necessarily reflect its true value.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in the number of cryptocurrencies in the market dilutes the dominance of Bitcoin and can make the metric less relevant. As more and more alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) emerge, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart becomes less meaningful as a measure of the overall market.\n\nOverall, while the Bitcoin Dominance Chart can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other digital assets, it should be used with caution and in conjunction with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nUse Bitcoin Dominance Chart With Other Indicators\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart (also known as Bitcoin Dominance Index) is a widely used metric in the cryptocurrency market that measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that is held by Bitcoin. The metric can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other digital assets and can help identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Bitcoin Dominance Chart has certain limitations, such as being based on market capitalization, which is a flawed measure of the actual value of a cryptocurrency, and not taking into account other factors such as user adoption, network effects, or technological advancements. Therefore, it's crucial to consider this metric in conjunction with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market. Nevertheless, understanding the Bitcoin Dominance Chart can be useful for making informed decisions about the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Dominance Index?\n\nBitcoin Dominance Index (BDI) is a metric that measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that is held by Bitcoin. It is calculated by taking the market capitalization of Bitcoin and dividing it by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. BDI is used to gauge the overall strength and influence of the Bitcoin market compared to other cryptocurrencies. It can also be used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market, helping to make predictions about future price movements.\n\nWho Created Bitcoin Dominance Index?\n\nThe origin of the Bitcoin Dominance Index (BDI) is not widely agreed upon, but it is believed to have been created by various individuals or groups who wanted to measure the importance of Bitcoin in the overall crypto economy.\n\nAccording to a Medium post written by Jimmy Song (a self-described Bitcoin educator, developer, and entrepreneur), the BDI was originally created by him to illustrate how much importance Bitcoin had in the overall crypto economy. However, it's worth noting that the BDI is not a proprietary index and can be calculated by anyone with access to the market capitalization data of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat Happens When BTC Dominance Is Low?\n\nWhen the BTC Dominance is low, it means that other cryptocurrencies are gaining market share and potentially overtaking Bitcoin in terms of overall value. This can indicate a trend where investors are moving away from Bitcoin and into other digital assets. It can also suggest that the market sentiment towards Bitcoin is negative, and investors are more bullish on other cryptocurrencies. Low BDI can also indicate that new projects and protocols are gaining popularity among investors, which leads to an increase in the market capitalization of other digital assets, diluting the dominance of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat if Bitcoin Dominance Goes Up?\n\nWhen BTC Dominance goes up, it means that Bitcoin is gaining market share and has a larger percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. This can indicate a trend where investors are moving back to Bitcoin and away from other digital assets. It can also suggest that the market sentiment toward Bitcoin is positive and that investors are more bullish on Bitcoin. High BDI can also indicate that Bitcoin is considered a safe-haven asset, and investors are moving their funds to it during market downturns."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices have surged this month, prompting Vietnamese to install mining rigs although it\u2019s not yet a lucrative trade.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin increased from $18,000 to $21,000 on January 14 and has moved sideways since then. The prices of many other cryptocurrencies, including ETC, Aleo, Kat and ERG have also risen this month.\n\nThien Binh, a seller of cryptocurrency mining rigs in Vietnam, said that people had been buying a lot of second-hand Asic brand rigs to mine Doge over the past week.\n\nOn average, an old Asic Baikal G28 model costs VND13 million ($550.8), one-third the cost of a new machine. If the current Doge price of $0.08 remains unchanged for months, miners will break even after 9-10 months.\n\nA veteran miner said: \"We are buying more rigs because mining is still easy now. If the Bitcoin price maintains its current level ($21,000), we will eventually make profits.\"\n\nBinh Minh, who owns many rigs in the southern province of Dong Nai, said some people have heavily invested in installing big networks of rigs to mine ETC and Bitcoin.\n\nSome miners are depositing their rigs at solar farms to cut down electricity costs and increase profits. Most miners use grid electricity.\n\nAccording to Hoang Quan, the administrator of a cryptocurrency mining community with nearly 70,000 members, mining is not lucrative at the moment, thanks to the current price of electricity and cryptocurrencies. But he said the recent increase in cryptocurrency prices is still good news ahead of the Tet holiday (Lunar New Year), which falls in late January.\n\nSome experienced miners said that although the Bitcoin price is rising, the cryptocurrency market is inherently unpredictable, and miners may face more difficulties in the coming time.\n\nVietnam had the second highest rate of cryptocurrency use among 74 economies surveyed in 2021, according to market data provider Statista.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrency has not been recognized as legitimate currency in Vietnam. Its central bank has warned that owning, trading and using cryptocurrency is risky and comes with no legal protection."

        "content": "Nigerian investors who purchased Bitcoin during the November slump are posting enormous gains in the online cryptocurrency market.\n\nData indicates that since its November lows, bitcoin has increased by at least $7,000 (p2p rate N5 million naira).\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Bitcoin along with major market leaders Ethereum and Solana, surged to levels not seen since August 2022, giving this week\u2019s cryptocurrency market recovery another shock.\n\nThe bulls\u2019 struggle, which lasted for a few days, appears to be over, at least temporarily, as BTC had one of its most remarkable overnight price increases in recent memory. It increased it from under $21,000 to more than $23.2K.\n\nNigerians\u2019 adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets as shown by KuCoin, a well-known crypto exchange, titled \u201cInto the Cryptoverse shows Nigeria stands up among the world; 35% of its citizens, or 33.4 million people, aged 18 to 60, either owned or traded bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in the previous six months.\n\nAccording to Google Trends, Nigeria had the most searches for bitcoin in the first few months of 2021, the report adds.\n\nNigerians are only behind the United States in Bitcoin trade volume from January to August of last year, and at that time, they were more likely to google \u201cBitcoin\u201d than people from any other nation.\n\nProducer price index (PPI) data this week showed a larger-than-anticipated fall, indicating the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary hawkishness has been curbing inflation and boosting investors.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, traders presently predict that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will increase rates by merely 25 basis points (or 0.25 percentage points) at its February meeting, a slowdown from the 50 basis-point increases in the meeting in December.\n\nWill the rally last? It appears that the current rally will last for longer than just a few weeks as a number of significant Crypto trading trends are pointing upward for the first time in many weeks.\n\nDue to its effortless breakthrough of the $1,500 price level, Ethereum has experienced weekly gains of more than 8%.\n\nDespite the Wednesday dip that took place in expectation of a significant announcement from U.S. federal prosecutors that many believed would target a key participant in the sector, Bitcoin and Ethereum have performed well.\n\nWith Saturday\u2019s unexpected increase, Bitcoin\u2019s seven-day gains now stand at 9%, with a 30% increase over the past 30 days. Bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped by 65% from its record high of over $69K in November 2021, but recent advances indicate that the cryptocurrency market is recovering after a difficult 2022.\n\nHowever, short sellers betting against the cryptocurrency market are facing difficulties and significant losses because, for the past 24 hours, 79,899 traders were liquidated, totaling $369.95 million.\n\nThe greatest single liquidation order, worth $4.53 million, was made on Bitmex."

        "title": "Someone illuminated a massive Bitcoin logo on Berlin's iconic TV tower - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency space continues to grow, and proponents of the sector are using different means to drive attention to assets like Bitcoin (BTC). One of the growing methods to push Bitcoin into the public eye is using symbolic global structures to promote the asset.\n\nIn particular, on January 21, the iconic Berliner Fernsehturm tower in Berlin was illuminated with the image of the Bitcoin logo as part of an advertising campaign, according to Documenting Bitcoin.\n\nThe #bitcoin logo is on the Berliner Fernsehturm tower in Berlin right now pic.twitter.com/Wn2b3koWUH \u2014 Documenting \u20bfitcoin \ud83d\udcc4 (@DocumentingBTC) January 21, 2023\n\nThe group or individual behind the initiative has yet to be identified, but a user named Tilo Neumann on Twitter has been promoting the campaign. In this line, Neumann proceeded to share a video of the projected Bitcoin logo.\n\n\u201cBerlin is definitely not rich, that\u2019s probably true. Nevertheless, \u201cwe\u201d want to draw attention to Bitcoin . After all, it is about our financial future. Some people sit down on a street and stick to it \u201cwe\u201d have decided to do it differently,\u201d Neumann said.\n\nInterestingly, this is not the first time the logo has been projected on the monument. According to a tweet by Neumann, the first attempt to project the logo was unsuccessful due to the use of poor projectors.\n\nAls wir das letzte mal vor Ort waren, war unser Beamer nicht Stark genug um dich zu erobern. Wenn wir das n\u00e4chste kommen, schaffen wir dich\ud83d\udc40 Die Vorbereitungen laufen, Gestern mehrere Beamer getestet, es wird wohl doch ein Laserbeamer werden.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 #Bitcoin #orangepillen #BTC pic.twitter.com/rj9Ez3Fe97 \u2014 Tilo Neumann (@neumi85_btc) November 26, 2022\n\nImplication of Bitcoin logo projection\n\nNotably, the Berliner Fernsehturm is a major tourist attraction and city symbol. The tower, which stands 368 meters tall, offers panoramic views of Berlin and is one of the tallest structures in Europe. Therefore, the projection of the logo on the Berliner Fernsehturm tower can be viewed as a powerful symbol highlighting the growing acceptance and awareness of Bitcoin.\n\nNotably, as per Neumann\u2019s Twitter activity, he has been involved in other campaigns of advertising Bitcoin on historic buildings and sites. For instance, in November last year, he shared that a logo was projected on the historic site of the Berlin wall.\n\n\u201cNothing in Berlin is as steeped in history as the Berlin Wall. That\u2019s why we carried out our campaign here this time. This place represents endless suffering. In contrast, Bitcoin stands for hope, the hope for a fair and free world,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin ads in Hong Kong\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin previously reported that massive advertising posters backing Bitcoin were plastered on a tram station located in front of HSBC Hong Kong headquarters back in September 2020. The ads were sponsored by the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong (BAHK).\n\nThe latest campaign coincides with a time when Bitcoin is rallying, with the asset breaching the $23,000 level.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Bitcoin proponents have been pushing the mainstream adoption of the asset. One of Bitcoin\u2019s selling points is the ability to solve some of the shortcomings in the traditional finance sector, like solving inflation due to its fixed supply.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
