        "title": "Bitcoin Scarcity and Store-of-Value Attributes \u2013 Global X ETFs - Global X",
        "content": "Within the fast-paced, ever-changing realm of digital assets stands a single, unchanging pillar. Bitcoin, the first cryptoasset, distinguishes itself by its decentralized nature, avoiding control by any singular entity. Supported by a finite supply and a high cost of production, scarcity is an integral component of bitcoin\u2019s value proposition. In this blog post, we explore how the countervailing forces of supply and demand can influence perceptions of scarcity and ultimately have an outsized influence on market dynamics.\n\nThis piece is part of a series that dives deeper into this year\u2019s iteration of our flagship research piece, Charting Disruption.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nGold and bitcoin are defined by rigid supply constraints and a high cost of production, resulting in stable and predictable supply schedules.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s scarcity is supported by the Halving which reduces bitcoin\u2019s annual issuance rate by 50% approximately every four years. Historically, the Halving has resulted in significant price appreciation of bitcoin in the year following the Halving.\n\nWith the next Halving scheduled for April 2024, market participants expect a similarly strong reaction to bitcoin\u2019s reduced supply.\n\nRelatively rigid supply constraints are one of the defining attributes of effective store-of-value assets. Gold, for example, has a finite total supply that exists on Earth. That supply has been determined by the laws of astrophysics and is not at risk of manipulation. Further, the costs and operational complexities associated with gold mining mean that the process of extracting the gold remaining under the Earth\u2019s surface is slow, resulting in a relatively stable drip of new supply into the global market each year.\n\nBitcoin is subject to similar constraints, but in a digital format. Rather than being dictated by astrophysical laws, bitcoin\u2019s maximum supply of 21M tokens was hardcoded into the protocol at inception and is protected from manipulation by the laws of proof-of-work (PoW) consensus. As with gold, the process of accessing untapped reserves of bitcoin is a financially intensive process, requiring significant capital investment and subject to the operational constraints of regular adjustments to the difficulty of bitcoin mining. Together, the confluence of a finite total supply with the technical and financial restraints on mining result in smooth and predictable supply schedules for both gold and bitcoin, directly supporting their scarcity.\n\nA key factor ensuring bitcoin\u2019s scarcity is the \u201cHalving.\u201d Occurring every 210,000 Bitcoin \u201cblocks,\u201d or approximately every four years, the Halving reduces the annual issuance rate of bitcoin by 50%, bringing the network one step closer to reaching its terminal supply of 21m. While these regular reductions in supply are both highly anticipated and predictable, historical market behavior suggests that the impact of the Halving tends not to be fully reflected in the price of bitcoin until about a year after the event occurs.\n\nOne explanation for this significant time lag could simply be market inefficiencies resulting from the nascency of crypto markets and the relative lack of sophistication among market participants. As such, it may be that asset mispricings are not exploited as quickly as would otherwise be the case in more mature markets. While this may carry some explanatory power, another reason for the time lag is likely due to the behaviors of bitcoin miners which are among the largest and most active participants in bitcoin markets on a daily basis.\n\nThe majority of miner revenues come from newly issued or \u201cmined\u201d bitcoin. To raise the cash needed to cover operational expenses, standard procedure is for a miner to sell a portion of this bitcoin issuance and hold the remaining portion on their balance sheet as an investment. While this generally holds throughout the market cycle, historical data shows that in the period leading up to a Halving, miners tend to increase the amount of bitcoin transferred to exchange platforms\u2014an indication of an intention to sell bitcoin reserves.1 This behavior is likely due to miners anticipating reduced bitcoin-denominated revenues following the Halving, incentivizing them to raise additional cash reserves while rewards are higher.\n\nAmong the largest structural sellers of bitcoin, the increased selling activity of bitcoin miners leading into the Halving seems to establish a price ceiling for bitcoin. It is only during the period following the Halving that miners revert to typical market behavior, ultimately allowing the market to move towards a higher equilibrium price that is reflective of bitcoin\u2019s newly reduced supply.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe store-of-value properties of gold and bitcoin are highly influenced by perceptions of scarcity. In large part, these perceptions depend on a tightly controlled, unchanging supply, and a mechanism to control their rate of inflation. For bitcoin, history has shown that the supply shock caused by the Halving represents a significant catalyst for the price of bitcoin. With bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving anticipated in early 2024, bitcoin will have yet another opportunity to demonstrate why it is one of the world\u2019s most unique assets."

        "content": "Jerry Yu has the trappings of what the Chinese call second-generation rich. He boasts a Connecticut prep-school education. He lives in a Manhattan condominium bought for $8 million from Jeffrey R. Immelt, the former General Electric chief executive. And he is the majority owner of a Bitcoin mine in Texas, acquired last year for more than $6 million.\n\nMr. Yu, a 23-year-old student at New York University, has also become \u2014 quite unintentionally \u2014 a case study in how Chinese nationals can move money from China to the United States without drawing the attention of authorities in either country.\n\nThe Texas facility, a large computing center, was not purchased with dollars. Instead, it was bought with cryptocurrency, which offers anonymity, with the transaction routed through an offshore exchange, preventing anyone from knowing the origin of the financing.\n\nSuch secrecy allows Chinese investors to avoid the U.S. banking system, and the accompanying oversight of federal regulators, as well as sidestep Chinese restrictions on money leaving China. In a more traditional transaction, a bank receiving the funds would know where they were coming from and would be required by law to report any suspicious activity to the U.S. Treasury."

The SEC has been under increasing pressure to greenlight a Spot Bitcoin ETF, which would open the door for institutional and more retail investors to access Bitcoin exposure via traditional investment avenues.\n\nAs the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits the SEC\u2019s decision, VanEck\u2019s bold marketing move has ignited conversations, fueling optimism about the integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial services.

        "title": "Heroes to zeroes in 12 months: How the two biggest crypto billionaire CEOs proved the critics right - CNBC",
        "content": "Combination showing Former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (L) and Zhao Changpeng (R), founder and chief executive officer of Binance. Getty Images | Reuters\n\nAfter a brutal 18 months of bankruptcies, company failures and criminal trials, the crypto market is starting to claw back some of its former standing. Bitcoin is up more than 150% this year. Meanwhile, Solana is nearly 10x higher in the last 12 months, and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital has also skyrocketed. Crypto-pegged stocks like Coinbase , MicroStrategy and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust rose more than 300% in value year-to-date. But even as prices swell, the sector's reputation has struggled to regain ground after names virtually synonymous with bitcoin have both been found guilty of crimes directly related to their multibillion-dollar crypto empires. For years, Binance's Changpeng Zhao and FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried preached the power of decentralized, digital currencies to the masses. Both were bitcoin billionaires who ran their own global cryptocurrency exchanges and spent much of their professional career selling the public on a new, tech-powered world order; one where an alternative financial system comprised of borderless virtual coins would liberate the oppressed by eliminating middlemen like banks and the over-reach of the government. Yet they both, in the end, helped crypto critics and regulators make the case that some of them had been right all along; that the industry was rife with grifters and fraudsters intent on using new tech to carry out age-old crimes. Even when the crypto market was at its hottest, as token prices hit all-time highs in Oct. 2021, some of the biggest names in business and politics shared their doubts. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in 2021 at peak crypto valuations that bitcoin was \"worthless,\" and he doubled down on that sentiment earlier this year when he said that the digital currency was a \"hyped-up fraud.\" Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said in 2018 that he would short bitcoin if he could, adding that cryptocurrencies are \"kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment.\" Legendary investor Warren Buffett said he wouldn't buy all of the bitcoin in the world for $25, because \"it doesn't produce anything,\" and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has long been one of crypto's greatest naysayers on Capitol Hill.\n\nRather than ushering in a new era of financial freedom, Zhao and Bankman-Fried were found guilty on a mix of charges including fraud and money laundering. Once the two biggest names in crypto, the sector's greatest proponents now face jail time. Bankman-Fried, 31, could be sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of seven criminal counts in early November, including charges related to stealing billions of dollars from FTX's customers. Less than three weeks after Bankman-Fried's conviction, Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as Binance's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. Their crimes varied, but ultimately, both crypto execs went from industry titans to convicted frauds in the span of 12 months, and it was, in part, the bitter feud between them that landed them there. \"They were both responsible for behavior that has kept a black eye on crypto and its association with criminal behavior,\" said Renato Mariotti, a former prosecutor in the U.S. Justice Department's Securities and Commodities Fraud Section.\n\nThe early days\n\nZhao and Bankman-Fried were friends at first, before they became one another's chief rival. CZ, as Zhao is also known, had been first to the space. After a stint as the chief technology officer of a centralized crypto exchange called OKCoin, he launched a spot exchange of his own in 2017 called Binance, which has since become the largest cryptocurrency trading platform in the world, by volume. That same year, Bankman-Fried earned street cred in crypto circles for his bitcoin arbitrage trading strategy, dubbed the Kimchi swap. While the price of bitcoin today is relatively standard across the world's exchanges, six years ago, the price differential would sometimes vary by more than 50%. This kind of arbitrage-based strategy, though relatively straightforward, wasn't the easiest thing to execute on crypto rails back then, since it involved setting up connections to each one of the trading platforms. To scale the operation, Bankman-Fried launched his own quantitative crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research. But what really put him on the map, according to Bankman-Fried, was CZ himself. Just after Bankman-Fried moved his business to Hong Kong at the end of 2018, he met CZ for the first time after contributing $150,000 to co-sponsor a Binance conference in Singapore. One of the perks of that donation was a slot onstage with the Binance chief. According to author Michael Lewis, whose book profiling Bankman-Fried was published the day the former FTX CEO's criminal trial began in October, Bankman-Fried said this appearance is what gave him \"legitimacy in crypto.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nThe pair, according to Lewis's reporting, were nothing alike in business or in personal dealings. \"Sam was gunning to build an exchange for big institutional crypto traders; CZ was all about pitching to retail and the little guy,\" Lewis wrote, adding, \"Sam hated conflict and so was almost weirdly quick to forget grievances; CZ thrived on conflict and nurtured the emotions that led to it.\" The relationship between Zhao and Bankman-Fried began to sour a few months after they met. In March 2019, CZ passed on paying Bankman-Fried $40 million to buy the futures crypto exchange that SBF had designed with his team, instead building a version of the same platform in-house. A month later, Bankman-Fried and a few others founded FTX.com, a first-of-its-kind futures trading exchange with a flashy new liquidation engine and features which catered to large-scale institutional clients. Binance was the first outside investor in FTX, funding a Series A round in 2019. As part of that arrangement, Binance took on a long-term position in FTX's native token, FTT, which was created to give perks to customers. FTX's success begat a $2 billion venture fund that seeded other crypto firms. Bankman-Fried's personal wealth grew to around $26 billion at its peak, and FTX reached a valuation of $32 billion before it all came crashing down. As crypto prices ran up in 2021, Bankman-Fried's reputation did the same. Suddenly, the wunderkind was praised by the press as the poster boy for crypto everywhere. The FTX logo adorned everything from Formula One race cars to a Miami basketball arena. Bankman-Fried went on an endless press tour, bragged about having a balance sheet that could one day buy Goldman Sachs, and became a fixture in Washington, where he was one of the Democratic Party's top donors, promising to sink $1 billion into U.S. political races before later backtracking. Bankman-Fried wielded some of that political influence to cast shade on Zhao and Binance's dealing. At the same time, CZ's influence continued to grow, as did Binance's market dominance. With assets of more than $65 billion on the platform, it processed billions of dollars in trading volume every year. As the two grew to be formidable opponents, FTX opted to buy out Binance in 2021 with a combination of FTT and other coins, according to Zhao. But much of Bankman-Fried's empire was a mirage, while Zhao's operation was laced with questionable business tactics under the hood. What ultimately exposed the grift at the two exchanges was the rivalry between the crypto bosses.\n\nwatch now\n\nBattle of the titans rocks crypto\n\nAs crypto prices tanked in 2022 and a cascade of bankruptcies rocked confidence in the sector, Bankman-Fried boasted that he and his enterprise were immune. But in fact, the industry-wide wipeout hit his operation quite hard. Alameda borrowed money to invest in failing digital asset firms in the spring and summer of 2022 to keep the industry afloat, then reportedly siphoned off FTX customers' deposits to stave off margin calls and meet immediate debt obligations. In Nov. 2022, a fight between Bankman-Fried and CZ on Twitter, now known as X, pulled the mask off the scheme. Zhao dropped the hammer with a tweet saying that because of \"recent revelations that have came [sic] to light, we have decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on our books.\" The threat led to a panic-led sell-off of the FTT token. As the price of the coin plummeted by over 75%, so too did confidence in the platform. FTX executives scrambled to contain the damage, but customers proceeded to pull billions of dollars off the exchange. Zhao, who swooped in and agreed to buy FTX in a fire sale, backed out of the deal after one day's worth of due diligence, and the company spiraled into bankruptcy. As outsiders got a look at FTX's actual books for the first time, the fraud became clear: Bankman-Fried and other leaders at FTX had taken billions of dollars in customer money. In fact, during the criminal trial of Bankman-Fried, both the prosecution and defense agreed that $10 billion in customer money that was sitting in FTX's crypto exchange went missing, with some of it going toward payments for real estate, recalled loans, venture investments and political donations. They also agreed that Bankman-Fried was the one calling the shots. The key question for jurors was one of intent: Did Bankman-Fried knowingly commit fraud in directing those payouts with FTX customer cash, or did he simply make some mistakes along the way? Jurors decided within a few hours of deliberation that he had knowingly committed fraud on a mass scale. The government's beef with Zhao and Binance was different. Three criminal charges were brought against the exchange, including conducting an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and conspiracy. Binance has agreed to forfeit $2.5 billion to the government, as well as to pay a fine of $1.8 billion, for crimes which included allowing illicit actors to make more than 100,000 transactions that supported activities such as terrorism and illegal narcotics. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference on Nov. 21 that the fine is \"one of the largest penalties we have ever obtained.\" \"Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor; it makes you a criminal,\" Garland said. The $4.3 billion settlement and plea arrangement with the U.S. government, including the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury Department, resolves a multiyear investigation into the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission, however, was notably absent. Zhao and others were also charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanctions \"in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the U.S. market without implementing controls required by U.S. law,\" according to the Justice Department. The DOJ is recommending that the court impose a $50 million fine on Zhao. In the meantime, CZ has been released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond secured by $15 million in cash and has a sentencing hearing scheduled for Feb. 23. Bankman-Fried faces a sentencing hearing on March 28.\n\nIndicted FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves the U.S. Courthouse in New York City, July 26, 2023. Amr Alfiky | Reuters\n\nWinning the war"

The former crypto icon faces up to 110 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for March 28, 2024.\n\n\"It's a warning, this case, to every single fraudster out there who thinks that they're untouchable or that their crimes are too complex for us to catch or that they're too powerful for us to prosecute or that they could try to talk their way out of it when they get caught,\" said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, as reported by NBC News . \"Those folks should think again.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to FTX's collapse, cryptocurrencies were in high demand on Wall Street, with Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $68,569 in November 2021. Shortly after that, demand fell off a cliff and prices plummeted. And in late 2021 or early 2022, what is described as a \"crypto winter\" began.\n\nWhat is a crypto winter?\n\nA crypto winter is loosely defined as an extended period when cryptocurrency prices move lower, combined with a decrease in overall trading volume. They can last months or even years. In that regard, they're not unlike bear markets for stocks.\n\nUnlike a recession , customarily defined by economists as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP (gross domestic product), cryptocurrencies have no specific definition. Therefore, every person's idea of when and what constitutes a crypto winter differs.\n\nThe first crypto winter began in February 2011 when Bitcoin dropped by 40% from $1.06 to 67 cents. The next one didn't happen until 2014, when the price of Bitcoin dropped from a high of more than $1,200 entering the year to a low of $180 by January 2015.\n\nHowever, the term crypto winter only came into common usage in 2018, after 2017's big run from $900 to $20,000, a 2,122% gain over 12 months, to fall back to $3,180 by December 2018.\n\nDuring 2017's irrational exuberance, publicly traded mainstream companies were changing their names to include the words blockchain or crypto, while others completely pivoted their business models to catch the crypto craze, similar to what occurred during the dot-com bubble in late 1999 and early 2000.\n\nThe most recent crypto winter occurred over 13 months, from the all-time Bitcoin high of $68,569 in November 2021 to a December 2022 bottom of below $17,000, a 75% decline.\n\nWhat causes a crypto winter?\n\nIn the most recent crypto winter in 2022, rampant inflation from a post-pandemic world required the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to dampen the economy, slowing demand and lowering prices.\n\nIt began raising the federal funds rate in March 2022, ultimately boosting the federal funds rate 11 times through July 2023, from 0.25%-0.50% to 5.25% to 5.5%%, the highest level in 22 years.\n\nAs a result, investors sold their risk-on assets such as crypto and stock, sending prices of both much lower by the end of 2022. It didn't help crypto prices that two cryptocurrencies, Luna and TerraUSD, collapsed in May 2022, followed by bankruptcies by crypto lenders Voyager Digital and Celsius Network. And FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022 put the nail in the proverbial coffin.\n\nLike stocks, crypto winters are often (but not always) caused by bad news, whether self-inflicted wounds such as a security breach or hack, reduced interest from institutional investors, unsettling economic news such as what happened in 2022, or increased regulatory overview.\n\nOver the long haul, these are all signs of a healthy marketplace that adjusts to current market, economic, and regulatory conditions.\n\nHow to tell if the crypto winter is over?\n\nWith Bankman-Fried set to go to prison for a long time in the first half of 2024, the industry can finally look ahead rather than in the rearview mirror.\n\nPositive signs that the latest crypto winter could be over include Bitcoin gaining roughly 150% in 2023, higher weekly inflows of crypto investment funds \u2013 much like how you'd look at mutual fund and ETF net inflows and outflows \u2013 and institutional money getting back into the crypto space by offering mainstream digital assets from the likes of BlackRock, Mastercard, etc.\n\nHowever, some crypto industry professionals suggest that the latest crypto winter won't be over until spot Bitcoin ETFs and spot Ethereum ETFs are approved for sale in the U.S. markets.\n\n\"That's the floodgate for large portfolios to allocate 50 basis points of their holdings to Bitcoin,\" said Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, as reported by Decrypt . \"To me, that would be the catalyst to essentially open up ... the end of crypto winter.\"\n\nJust as there is no specific definition of a crypto winter, there is no rule to indicate when one has ended. As a relatively new asset class, that comes with the territory."

        "content": "Amidst a monumental surge in 2023, Bitcoin BTC/USD has reached $44,000, notching a 150% climb in value in 2023. The rise has garnered the focus of Bitcoin maximalists and high-profile personalities, who, collectively dubbed the \u201cmillion dollar club,\u201d are forecasting a historic peak that could see Bitcoin reaching the $1 million milestone.\n\nMillion-Dollar Dreams for Bitcoin\n\nArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood in August, said that Bitcoin has the potential to surge into the six-figure range and possibly reach $1 million by 2030. In an exclusive interview with Benzinga, Wood reaffirmed her conviction that Bitcoin could achieve the $1 million mark within a timeframe of five to seven years.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki, the author behind \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d has long championed the rise of Bitcoin. He predicted Bitcoin would reach $1 million in August. \"IF world economy crashes BC [Bitcoin] $1 million Gold $ 75K silver to $60k. SAVERS of FAKE US $ F'd. DEBT too high.\"\n\nAdding to the bullish forecasts, in March, Balaji Srinivasan, the former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Coinbase, placed a bet that Bitcoin\u2019s value will reach $1 million by June 17. He cited imminent hyperinflation of conventional currencies, which he believes will thrust the global economy into a state of \u201chyperbitcoinization,\u201d crowning Bitcoin the preferable global currency akin to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d However, he lost that bet.\n\nIn December, Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, said Bitcoin would likely reach $1 million in the \"days to weeks\" following the approval of a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), reported Cointelegraph. \"You're hitting a very limited supply of Bitcoin on the exchanges and available for purchase with a torrent of money.\"\n\nSee More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data Reveals\n\nSaylor to Keiser: High Stakes Estimates\n\nSome other experts and CEOs had their own set of predictions for Bitcoin\u2019s future value.\n\nDuring a discussion with CNBC, Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy\u2019s CEO and Chairman, expressed confidence that Bitcoin could increase tenfold in value. He anticipates further adoption, spurred by significant macro and technical developments expected in 2024. Among these, Saylor said the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, saying, \u201cYou're going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted into $6 billion of natural selling a year\u2014at the same time as things like spot Bitcoin ETFs increase the demand for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency firm Matrixport projected a short-term climb, stating that Bitcoin\u2019s price could reach $45,000 within two months. This 30% hike from its present valuation is based on several in-house models that previously anticipated Bitcoin\u2019s October surge.\n\nOthers like Arthur Hayes, in an episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, estimated a Bitcoin price range between $750,000 and $1 million by 2026. On the other hand, Max Keiser took to X to claim that Bitcoin will rise to $220,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Gracy Chen, Bitget CEO expressed skepticism about the idea of Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2030, as theorized by Cathie Wood, calling the prediction \u201ca bit crazy.\u201d Yet, Chen predicts a rise to $100,000 remains within possibility.\n\nPhoto by kitti Suwanekkasit on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?"

BTC is declining and might be at risk of a downside break below the $41,500 level.\n\nBitcoin is slowly moving lower from the $43,800 resistance zone.\n\nThe price is trading below $43,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.\n\nThere is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $42,550 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $43,000 level.\n\nBitcoin Price Takes Hit\n\nBitcoin price made a fresh attempt to gain pace above the $43,200 level. BTC climbed above the $43,500 level, but it struggled to reach the $44,000 resistance zone.\n\nA high was formed near $43,792 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a clear inverted V pattern formed and the price declined below the $43,200 level. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $41,637 swing low to the $43,792 low.\n\nBitcoin is now trading below $43,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. It is also consolidating below the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $41,637 swing low to the $43,792 low.\n\nOn the upside, immediate resistance is near the $42,500 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $42,550 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first major resistance is $43,000. A close above the $43,000 level could send the price further higher.\n\nSource: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main hurdle sits at $43,250. A close above the $43,250 resistance could start a decent move toward the $43,800 level. The next key resistance could be near $44,000, above which BTC could rise toward the $45,000 level.\n\nMore Losses In BTC?\n\nIf Bitcoin fails to rise above the $43,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $42,150 level.\n\nThe next major support is near $41,650. If there is a move below $41,650, there is a risk of more losses. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $40,500 support in the near term.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $42,150, followed by $41,650.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $42,550, $43,000, and $43,800.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin halving and why it matters? - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Edul Patel\n\nAt the forefront of discussions within the crypto community lies an event of paramount importance\u2014Bitcoin Halving. With the next Bitcoin Halving scheduled for the upcoming year, it stands as the focal point of current discourse, captivating the attention and curiosity of enthusiasts alike. This pivotal event is of significant importance to the Bitcoin network.\n\n\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\n\n\nBitcoin was introduced by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. It is a decentralized digital currency with a capped supply of 21 million coins. To regulate the issuance of new bitcoins and control inflation, Nakamoto incorporated a mechanism known as the \u201chalving\u201d into the protocol.\n\n\n\nApproximately every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks are mined, the reward for miners is halved. In the early days, miners received 50 bitcoins per block; after the first halving in 2012, this dropped to 25 and subsequently to 12.5 in 2016. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, reducing the reward to 6.25 bitcoins per block. This predetermined reduction in supply is hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol, ensuring a gradual and predictable issuance until the maximum supply is reached.\n\n\n\nWhy Bitcoin Halving Matters?\n\n\n\nScarcity Implications:\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value proposition is the concept of scarcity, mirroring precious metals like gold. The halving mechanism plays a pivotal role in accentuating this scarcity. As the supply of new bitcoins dwindles, the existing stock becomes more valuable, creating a deflationary economic model.\n\n\n\nIn traditional fiat currencies, central banks have the authority to print money at will, leading to inflation. With its capped supply and halving events, Bitcoin offers a hedge against inflation, making it an attractive asset for investors seeking a store of value.\n\n\n\nMarket Dynamics and Price Volatility:\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is often accompanied by heightened market speculation and price volatility. Historical data reveals that leading up to and following a halving event, the cryptocurrency experiences significant price movements. The scarcity factor often results in surges in demand and subsequent price rallies.\n\n\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that the relationship between halving events and price is complex and influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and investor sentiment. While past halvings have been associated with bull markets, they are not foolproof indicators of future price movements, but there is just a likelihood.\n\n\n\nMining Economics\n\n\n\nMining, the process by which new bitcoins are created, and transactions are added to the blockchain, is an integral component of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The halving has direct implications for the economics of mining. Miners must rely more on transaction fees to sustain their operations as the block reward diminishes.\n\n\n\nThis dynamic can lead to increased competition among miners, potentially consolidating mining power in regions with low electricity costs. Additionally, it underscores the importance of transaction fees in securing the network, aligning miners\u2019 interests with the long-term health of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n\n\nGlobal Impact\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving events attract global attention, serving as a focal point for discussions on the future of money and the role of cryptocurrencies in the broader financial landscape, contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s growing legitimacy as a viable asset class.\n\n\n\nThe significance of the halving extends beyond the crypto community, permeating into traditional finance, policy-making, and economic discourse. Governments and central banks are compelled to reckon with the rise of decentralization, prompting discussions on regulatory frameworks and digital asset integration.\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\nWhile the Bitcoin halving injects a sense of excitement and anticipation into the crypto space, it is not without its challenges. Scaling issues, environmental concerns related to energy consumption in mining, and regulatory uncertainties pose ongoing hurdles. The evolving landscape demands collaboration between the crypto industry and regulators to foster responsible innovation and ensure the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, the Bitcoin halving is a testament to the protocol\u2019s resilience and the foresight of its creator. Beyond the technical intricacies, it symbolizes the pursuit of an alternative financial system\u2014one built on principles of scarcity, decentralization, and economic sovereignty. It symbolizes a departure from traditional monetary systems, offering an alternative vision where individuals can transact and store value with greater autonomy. As the crypto community eagerly anticipates each halving event, it reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is not merely a technological innovation but a transformative force poised to reshape the future of finance.\n\nThe author is co-founder and CEO, Mudrex\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"
